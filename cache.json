But hey, it's coming to Switch next year, and eShop pre-orders are now open.\nIn a new pre-order trailer (above), we get another look at the Star Wars arcade brawler, complete with its new features. This includes all unlockables available from the jump, 13 fresh playable characters (shoutout to the Weequay fans) and some of the classic cheat codes from later releases of the game — Qui-Gon's head has never looked so bulbous.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

As the main antagonist in Indiana Jones And The Great Circle, Emmerich Voss vacates the archetypal armchair usually reserved for secondary fascist goons, so that he can goosestep straight into the big boy seat himself. He smiles with all the sleaze of right-hand-man Major Toht, the grubby gestapo who gets that right hand burned in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Yet he also engages in the pseudo-intellectual trash talk of the main archaeological rivals to Jones, like Rene Belloq or Walter Donovan. He is a hideous grab bag of all the things that make an instantly detestable villain in the series. But there's something else. Voss is so immediately and gutturally hateable because he resembles a type of racist encountered not in the 1930s, but one you've probably met today: the asshole you meet on the internet.\nWarning: Here be spoilers.\nRead more",

I’ve got a heart. It’s actually very useful. Nothing to be scared of\". Thing is, Eclipsium’s menu heart is actually massive and sits, like The Eye Of Sauron, atop a giant obelisk. “Ah. That’s definitely a horror thing, that” I was forced to admit. \"If my heart was on a giant obelisk, I’d be proper shaken up, I reckon.\"\nSo starts Eclipsium’s very first bit of aggressive disorientation, and it basically just escalates from there. I obviously can’t describe the vibes without slightly spoiling the vibes, so do pop over to Steam for a demo if you’re curious and, oh, there’s a potted plant, the sound of its rustling mixed in such a way that it sort of sounds like it’s shrieking at me. Well.\nRead more",

          "description": "“Hang on a sec. Haven’t I seen this exact genre of little guy before?” was my reaction upon encountering the yellow-eyed, hat-shrouded mage of isometric adventure Oolo. Some quick internet sleuthing turned up this lovely bit of art featuring Final Fantasy 9’s Vivi, Journey’s Traveller, and He-Man’s Orko. It’s a great feeling to begin your week identifying an archetype of diminutive magician, and I hope it becomes a regular occurrence. Another pleasant  discovery was Oolo itself, which you can discover yourself through the shrouded magic of this link to it’s free demo.\n(Do I need to keep writing ‘free demo’, by the way? I tend to alternate. It’s obviously redundant but I feel writing ‘free’ gives it a certain gravitas. Free tax rebate. Free sunrise. Free oxygen. It makes things sound better.)\nRead more",

Both (the best Final Fantasy game) Final Fantasy 8’s Squall and The Witcher 3’s Geralt simply cannot get enough of leaving their friends and the entire world in mortal peril while they sneak in a quick round of cards, and I love them for it. Way back when the Wild Hunt released, there was a special edition kicking about that gave you a few decks for Gwent - the fleshed-out, playable card distraction that ended up being responsible for some of the game’s best moments. I pined for those decks, but I never acquired them. Now, Hatchette Board Games is putting out a full physical edition of Gwent next year.\nThe set contains \"over 400 cards and a playmat\" for £44/$39.99. I’m still recovering from various Fantasy Flight LCGs, so my value sense for this stuff might be a bit skewed, but that strikes me as incredibly reasonable. A good Gwent deck consists of only about 25 cards. They’re not bad cards, either! I’ve got a real pet hate for tabletop versions of videogames that just use in-engine screenshots for the cards, but these ones look to have the proper artwork from the game on them:\nRead more",

Still, it’s not often we see psychological horror combined with ultraviolence, and anything that gives off even a whiff of Condemned: Criminal Origins has my attention.\nTotal Chaos started life as a popular Doom 2 mod, and while I dare the say the limitations of that game sell the atmosphere a little better than this much sleeker update, I certainly trust Trigger Happy enough to make the most of the new engine. The game is set in New Oasis, a “once bustling haven for coal miners” that is now most definitely not bustling, nor haven-like.\nRead more",

History actually remembers Computer Artworks’s 2002 shooty horror game for how incredibly ambitious and conceptually inventive its proto-sus social squad system was. In homage to the body-snatching alien paranoia of Carpenter’s 1982 horror classic, The Thing tasks you with not just assembling and directing a squad, but keeping them from breaking down or turning on you - in fear you might be hosting the titular molecular stowaway.\nRead more",

It's playfully dull, heartily mundane entertainment. No supernatural flourishes here - just the magic of paperwork and the thrill of bureaucracy.\r\n\n\r\nI'm reminded of Sakura Quest by Danchi Days, a forthcoming cosy adventure with irresponsibly enticing Game Boy Advance-style visuals.

They’ve heard player feedback on the missing weapon oomph caused by the lack of hitstop in the Monster Hunter Wilds beta, and they’re bringing back the bonk.\nHere’s a handy breakdown of the issue by X user Blue Stigma, but briefly: hitstop is the brief pause in an attack animation the moment the weapon connects with an enemy, giving you a real sense of bonkitude and making say, a hammer feel different from a dagger. As the video showed, the hitstop was greatly reduced in Wilds compared to previous Monster Hunters, and many players reported the combat just feeling a bit off as a result.\nRead more",

And as that realisation sunk in for the first time, my heart also sank with it. I really tried, I mean really tried to get into Nikki's gacha offerings; to delight in its menagerie of menus and cash in countless currencies for fun socks or glitzy tiaras. Sadly, I won't be logging back in ever again.\nRead more",

          "description": "When I downloaded Creeper World IXE's demo, I had it pegged as a bizarre original. It is, in fact, the latest in a series of real-time strategy games in which you position turrets and terraform maps to repel surging, simulated tides of purple liquid. This is a war between flesh and mineral, solidity and fluidity that dates back to the age of Gillen. Alex Wiltshire (RPS in peace) interviewed creator Virgil Wall back in 2019 - amongst other things, we learn that the original Creeper World was based on a \"failure\" - and Sin has an  enthusiastic piece from 2021 about Creeper World 4, the first 3D instalment.\nWhat does Creeper World IXE bring to the party? Well, 1) it ain't 3D, and 2) it's billed as an exercise in \"dominating\" the titular Creeper, rather than keeping it at bay. For too long has this sloshing, coruscating hooligan been allowed to wash over and corrode our precious starports. We will take the fight to it in the shape of an upgradeable 2D starfleet, equipped with lasers we can use to chisel away the geography and re-rout the flow of villainous Vimto. \n Read more",

It gets played regardless because a lot of people don't know it's a solved game - specifically, young children you may wish to humiliate using your superior grown-up brain, because when you were a child somebody did the same to you. \nHow many twisted adults were born from the experience of being bullied via the medium of tic-tac-toe?

Again, you play as a bald man (called Jeff) who sits in a 4x4 bathtub and must ascend a series of difficult roads. There's a demo out now and let me tell you, it's awfully good.\nRead more",

If you don’t own them already, they’re also currently on discount as a bundle.\n\"We’re deeply saddened to share the news that Warcraft: Orcs and Humans and Warcraft II will leave our store on December 13th, 2024,” wrote GOG on X. \"Seeing these masterpieces leave our store is tough, but it also serves as another reminder of why our mission at GOG is so important.

Yuck. If there’s one type of design that deserves the accolade, though, it’s RPGs that are assured enough in the richness of their worlds to not feel the need to signpost every discovery.\nIt’s a feedback loop of charitable feelings: the game is saying \"we think you’re smart enough to find this stuff on your own\". \"You’re right!\" you respond. \"I am smart! And anyone who recognises that must be one smart cookie\". Joy abounds, it rains Tunnock’s Caramel Wafers, hedgehogs jig gracefully in the street, and all is right with the world.

Some NPCs wouldn’t be swayed by this, but some would lower their weapons at the offer of a prawn cocktail treat, and so you’d be constantly playing chicken with various guards: edging closer toward them, your shaking hands rattling the delicious disks inside the oily packet, mentally weighing up whether it's worth risking them turning hostile at the last second.\nObviously, I’d scan some real crisp packets and just alter the logos for maximum immersion.

It needs a bit longer. But I'm about ready to start recommending it.\nI'm a tad biased by my love for their previous Star Traders Colon Frontiers, an interest in mercenary management, and a wish for more turn-based tactics games that aren't bloody XCOM again. That I have reservations about what CKF hasn't yet nailed down is in part a symptom of high expectations.

But even if hadn’t been ecommerced to death, there’d still be a way to get the upgraded ray tracing and DLSS 3 frame gen tools of the RTX 40 series for less cash still: plucky 1080p contender, the RTX 4060, whose deals are still very much available and kicking.\nIn the UK, the best available prices are for the MSI GeForce RTX Ventus 2X Black edition, which is the partner card I happen to own myself – and has become the effective go-to GPU for RPS game performance tests. Over in the US, meanwhile, the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4060 Gaming OC is the most affordable of all; it’s a chunkier design than that of the compact Ventus 2X, though that’s mainly just the tradeoff for having an extra fan. These cards were already on the cheaper end of the RTX 4060 spectrum, and now they’re £30 / $35 off in the sales. Bargain.\nRead more",

It’s partly your fault, you know. You like it too much.\nThis time it’s down from £80 to £26 in the UK (£27 outside the Bezos Empire), which isn’t quite an all-time low, but is pretty close – and a silly-good price for such a capable mouse in any case. Its US discount price of $35 ain’t half bad either, though I notice Amazon US is shouting louder about knocking the newer G502 X down from $80 for $45. That’s mostly a fine mouse as well, though I find its redesigned scroll wheel a bit too much on scratchy side. Of the two, I’d stick with the classic.\nRead more",

The 2TB version is also an excellent buy at £100, and there are decent offers up for grabs in the US too.\nRead more",

          "description": "Okay okay, just one more handheld deal then I’ll look at some desktop stuff. But here’s a properly chunky Black Friday discount on the most endearingly out-there Steam Deck rival to date, the Lenovo Legion Go: the 512GB model has shed hundreds of pounds/dollaridoos to fall all the way to £479 / $500. That’s really not a lot for something that goes full luxe on its display and build quality, not to mention its party trick of letting the two controller sections split off, Nintendo-switch style, with one acting as a portable mouse.\nThis is also the cheapest that the Legion Go has ever gone, at least in the UK, so could make a good pickup if you’ve been wanting something with more power than the Steam Deck range but have been put off by the Legion Go or Asus ROG Ally X’s high launch pricing.\nRead more",

          "description": "Since its debut all the way back in Season 7, the Cold Swap has grown to be an absolute fan favorite among the massive array of pickaxes in Fortnite, the latter given its unique aesthetic and charm. \n\n\nBut true to that, it's no surprise that a question continues to arise among the community. After all, when will the Cold Snap return? Here's when will the Cold Snap return to the Fortnite shop, as well as how much the item will most likely cost. \n\n\nWhen is Cold Snap returning to Fortnite?\n\n\nUnfortunately for all who, like me, missed the chance to add the pickaxe to their collection when it was last featured in the game's shop, there's currently no way to know when the Cold Snap will be returning to Fortnite. On that note, and given both the item's first release date and how well it fits the Holiday theme, I would not be surprised if the pickaxe were to make a return to the shop during the days surrounding this year's Christmas.\n\n\nFor those curious, the pickaxe's last appearance in the store dates back to June 28, 2024, when it was featured as part of the Clix's Locker bundle.\n\n\nHow Much Does the Cold Snap Cost?\n\n\nAccording to the Fortnite.GG database, the Cold Snap has been featured in the game's shop a total of 63 times since its release on December 28, 2018, In all times, the pickaxe could be purchased either alone for 800 V-bucks or as part of bundles ranging from 2.300 to 2.500 V-Bucks. \n\n\nNow that you know when we can expect the Cold Snap pickaxe to return in Fortnite, don't forget to also check out How to find Godzilla. If you are like me and cannot wait for the mode's debut, I also recommend checking out All available jobs in LEGO Fortnite Brick Life.\n\nThe post When is Cold Snap returning to Fortnite? appeared first on Destructoid.",

Update 2.2 includes bug fixes and \"new features\" to the game. No, it's not a PlayStation 5 Pro patch. Stop asking.\n\n\nWord on what the surprise Update 2.2 will bring to Cyberpunk 2077 soon will be a mystery until its contents are revealed. CD Projekt Red announced via X that it's lifting the veil on the patch tomorrow, December 10, at 5 p.m. CET during a live stream on Twitch and YouTube. \n\n\n\"Join us for a new episode of #REDstreams, where we'll dive deep into the new features Coming Soon TM for Cyberpunk 2077 in Update 2.2,\" the company wrote on X. \"See you tomorrow at 5 PM CET on our Twitch and, for the first time ever, simultaneously on our YouTube channel.\"\n\n\n\n\nCyberpunk 2077 surprise update brings new things, but not that\n\n\nThe news of another patch wasn't expected, especially since it hasn't even been a week since the last one. Update 2.1 arrived for players on December 4 with additional fixes, features, and vehicle options. Perhaps something needed more work and got delayed for a few days. Who can say? \n\n\n\n\n\nWe don't know what's inside Update 2.2 for Cyberpunk 2077, but we know what it will not bring. The company has no plans to ship a PS5 Pro patch for the game. CD Projekt announced the news in November, but that didn't stop folks on X from asking about it. Several times. The game also won't get a New Game Plus mode, as doing so would \"break the way the game is constructed,\" according to its lead quest designer. \n\n\nAll we know is that it'll bring more \"cool\" features and break all of your mods. But according to the team on X, \"It will be worth it.\" \n\nThe post Cyberpunk 2077 is getting a surprise update with ‘new features’ to celebrate four-year anniversary appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you're someone who loves to play LEGO Fortnite, there might be a couple of amazing skins that you can unlock in the near future for absolutely free of cost.\n\n\nEpic giving away free skins isn't uncommon, and that's done periodically across all available game modes. The recent rumors are from reliable leaker ShiinaBR, who has shared information about the two upcoming freebies. Incidentally, the skins will be exclusive to the LEGO Fortnite mode, and one of them so far has been a shop item. If the rumors are to be believed, players will be able to unlock Mr. Dappermint and Chord Kahele for free.\n\n\nHow to unlock Chord Kahele in LEGO Fortnite\n\n\n\n\nTo unlock this specific outfit, you'll need to earn XP on the mobile version of the game. Hence, you'll need to download the Android client and then use the same account. After that, you'll have to gain a certain amount of XP (the exact amount remains unknown) by playing the game on your mobile device. Do note that you can't complete this objective by playing on your consoles, and that's how you can unlock the Chord Kahele skin.\n\n\nHow to unlock Mr. Dappermint In LEGO Fortnite\n\n\nUnlocking this skin will be much easier, but you'll have to create a LEGO account (or login to your existing account). Once done, make sure to link it with your Epic account (the same one you use to play Fortnite). After you have completed the step, Mr. Dappermint will be added to your account.\n\n\nIncidentally, the skin has been present in the item shop, so I am not sure what step Epic will take if you have purchased it previously. As of writing, the release date for the two skins remains unknown. Additionally, you'll be able to find the unlock condition for any free skin that gets announced in the near future.\n\nThe post All free LEGO Fortnite skins and how to get them appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Pro Open Mystery Nation objective has returned to EA FC 25 with the start of a new matchday, and you can solve a simple task to get some useful rewards.\n\n\nThe Mystery Nation objective is a fun task that EA Sports has been releasing as part of the FC Pro Open tournament. A nation is revealed on every matchday during the broadcast, and players have to pick a footballer from that country to complete a certain task. The condition of the task is now available, but the nation is usually not revealed at the start. \n\n\nDisclaimer: Article to be updated. \n\n\nHow to complete EA FC 25 Pro Open Mystery Nation objective (Matchday 3)\n\n\nThis is the third Mystery Nation objective that has been revealed by EA Sports. Here is the condition that you'll have to complete to win your rewards. \n\n\n\nScore three goals using a Finesse Shot with a player from the mystery nation in any UT game mode. The name of the nation will be hinted at during the broadcast of FC Pro Open Matchday 3.\n\n\n\n\nIt's exactly the same task that was available on Matchday 2 as well. Once you complete the objective, you'll be rewarded with a Premium Electrum Players Pack. Make sure to complete the objective as quickly as possible, as it will expire on December 10 at 5:59 p.m. UTC. \n\n\nThe task can be completed in any available Ultimate Team game mode. To complete it quicker, you should try the Squad Battles matches, where you play against the AI. Doing so will allow you to focus entirely on the conditions of the task, and get the rewards quicker. \n\n\n\n\nAs of writing, the mystery nation is yet to be revealed. Once we have the solution, the information is going to be available here, and you can get all the rewards. If you believe in user-generated comments, it's Cameroon. \n\n\nThat said, we will update the nation once it's officially confirmed on the show. \n\nThe post EA FC 25 Pro Open Mystery Nation objective solutions (Matchday 3) appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Being a major one-stop digital storefront for many-a-PC gamer, Steam has dominated the market for around 20 years. It is a convenient place to purchase and play games online, and it's easy to see why this is, but all the sales and discount events that occur throughout the year make it even more alluring.\n\n\nWhile we've just had the Autumn Sale, Steam is by no means done for 2024. With the closing weeks of the year now upon us, we still have one more event to go: the Steam Winter sale. But when is it happening, exactly?\n\n\nImage via RPS.\n\n\nWell, you still have some time to prepare as, according to a post from Steam that lists all the events of 2024, the Winter Sale will begin on December 19 and end on January 2, 2025. There's also a countdown clock on SteamDB, which shows that – at the time of writing – it'll officially begin in just over 10 days and four hours, with it scheduled to kick off at 18:00.\n\n\nWinter may be cold, but Steam could be in hot water\n\n\nAs always with these things, we can't be sure what games will actually be discounted until closer to the date (or on the date itself). For the Winter Sale 2023, Steam saw such titles as Mortal Kombat 1, Dave the Diver, Red Dead Redemption 2, Elden Ring, and even Starfield get prices slashed temporarily, with some games having as much as 80% off.\n\n\nOf course, it's not all bells that are jingly. Steam's owner and developer Valve is currently embroiled in an antitrust lawsuit. The suit was recently granted a \"class action\" status, with the file claiming that the 30% commission the company takes on games sold via its platform (compared to Epic Games Store's 12%) is \"anti-competitive.\"\n\n\nHaving said that, we gamers needn't worry ourselves too much about that right now. We're getting closer to the Steam Winter Sale 2024 and, with that, the closing moments of what has been a pretty bleak year for the industry. Go out with a smile and more games in your library, I guess.\n\nThe post When is the Steam Winter 2024 sale? appeared first on Destructoid.",

A je důležité říct si něco o tom, o jakou podívanou vlastně jde a v čem přesně spočívá ten \"remaster\".\nU zrodu tohoto počinu stálo elektronické hudební duo Daft Punk, které v roce 2001 vydalo své album \"Discovery\". K písničkám z alba vyšly animované videoklipy, které produkoval Leidži Macumoto, což byl kultovní japonský výtvarník (zemřel loni), který měl na svém kontě mnoho animovaných seriálů, především ze 70. - 80. let (nejslavnější z nich byl asi \"Space Battleship Yamato\"). Daft Punk ho oslovili proto, že na jeho seriálech vyrůstali, takže výsledné dílo, včetně \"jednodušší\" retro animace a naivní zápletky zcela záměrně připomíná staré japonské televizní počiny (n…",
