Taito's Growl is one such game and it is making its way to the Arcade Archives this week from 27th July (thanks, Nintendo Everything).\nOriginally released in Japanese arcades in 1990 (later on the Genesis in 1991), Growl sees you playing as one of four rangers who set out on a mission to take down a group of poachers that are hunting the local wildlife. HAMSTER has uploaded an announcement trailer for this one (above) which shows the kind of all-explosive action that this beat-em-up is all about — because nothing soothes an afraid lion like the sound of four rocket launchers, right?\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

When I initially started Tears of the Kingdom, I had forgotten about the Yiga Clan. In the run-up to the game's release, my mind had been so preoccupied with thoughts of \"What's the plan for dungeons?\", \"Am I going to need to re-learn the timeline?\", and \"Please, for the love of Hylia, don't let those flipping Koroks come back\", that Master Kohga and co. had taken a backseat in my considerations. And so, when I was first ambushed by an undercover Yiga while making an early trek across Hyrule Field, I was a little disappointed.

Before the dire reality of adulthood robs them of any shred of innocence, children are able to completely alter almost every facet of their lives, including their personality, their surroundings, and the people around them. It's really quite remarkable.\nParents in Japan have clearly cottoned on to this and have decided to utilise the Pikmin franchise to keep their children from misbehaving. As spotted by the folks over at Automaton, parents essentially allow their children to pretend to be Pikmin, thus ensuring that they remain close when out and about.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Three decades have gone by since the original Myst graced the world, providing endless online debates about whether it's smart or just pretentious. Magical or plain bad. Some indie developers chose the latter with a Myst FPS remix that spoofed the senior adventure game. The RPS readership seemed split on the subject when we asked \"Have You Played Myst?\" years ago. But Humble Games leans toward the former as it’s choosing to celebrate the classic's whopping 30th birthday with a returning charity bundle, available now until August 3rd.\r\n\n\r\nThe Humble Myst & More Bundle packages the titular point-and-clicker, alongside several other sequels, spiritual successors, and odd offshoots from developer Cyan Worlds. You can pay anything over £7.80/$10 for the 11-game bundle, or you can pay at least £15.60/$20 to also grab the Myst remake from 2021. \r\n\n\r\nCyan Worlds loves a good re-release, and this latest bundle is a reminder of how many Mysts have Mysted over the years. There’s Myst: Masterpiece Edition which remasters the music and imagery, and is otherwise as close to the original as you can get. Then there’s realMyst: Masterpiece Edition which added changing weather, day-night cycles, free roam movement, and a bonus epilogue. And finally, there’s the most recent pretty remake that’s also compatible with VR.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Based on the shooter series of the same name, the Borderlands film now has an official release date: August 9th, 2024. The action-comedy adaptation wrapped principal shooting in 2021, but it’s been somewhat stuck in post-production limbo ever since with several rounds of reshoots pushing out the release further than expected. \r\n\n\r\nThis comes after reports that co-writer Craig Mazin - best known as the showrunner behind HBO’s The Last Of Us and Chornobyl - removed his name from the project in favour of a pseudonym. More recently, Mazin confirmed to Variety that the pen name reports were false and he’s instead “not a credited writer” on Borderlands at all anymore. Mazin is instead focusing on The Last Of Us’ second season.\r\n\n\r\nThe Borderlands was mostly directed by Eli Roth, known for his work on the Hostel films and Cabin Fever. Roth was reportedly busy during reshoots, however, so studio Lionsgate enlisted the help of Tim Miller, the director behind Deadpool, to helm the project for a few weeks. \r\n \nRead more",

You'll rewind and fast forward time to plot suspicious movements, track stolen objects as they move across town, and work out who (or what) is causing all this chaos.

Starting today, The Elder Scrolls Online and Murder By Numbers are both free to keep from the digital store. Something for multiplayer dragon slayers and solo picross lovers alike. \r\n\n \r\nThe Elder Scrolls Online is, well, The Elder Scrolls but online. The long-running MMO has been unlocking doors into every corner of Tamriel, most recently with the Necrom expansion’s otherworldly tentacles and massive mushrooms. It's good at accommodating solo players who are looking to scratch a Skyrim-sized itch - since the next Elder Scrolls is at least five years away. That approachability got the game into our list of the ten best MMOs on PC. \r\n\n\r\nOn the other end of the humanities versus maths spectrum, we have Murder By Numbers, a murder mystery visual novel where you complete picross puzzles to further the investigation.

AliceB said the game was “worth a poke around if you’re a fan of either genre involved,” in our Murder By Numbers review.

Variety in the dinos, in the modes, in just about everything!\". To some extent, they were right. There are fun moments to be had as you queue up for Dino Survival and suddenly, remarkably, things have changed a bit.\nBut the game doesn't respect your time. It forces you to sit through hours of repetitive dino-slaying and then only offers you the chance, the chance to slay dinos in a way that isn't excruciatingly samey. Even as someone who finds the fun in mindless carnage, I'd much rather ditch my mech suit and let the dinosaurs run rampant. The dinosaurs don't deserve this.\nRead more",

Its unusual triple-decker sandwich of strategic, match-three RPG puzzling hasn't really been replicated in the fifteen-odd years since it first came out, unless you count its own HD remaster that came out in 2011. Alas, with that version now having gone off sale on PC in favour of this further spruced up Definitive Edition, this is now the best and only way to play it. Originally developed by the same core team at Capybara Games that went on to make the excellent Grindstone, this Definitive Edition has been handled entirely by remake house Dotemu, and yep, I now see what all the fuss is about. However, I also have quite a lot of reservations about it. For all its clear, obvious brilliance, it's also a very hard game to love.

Turns out there’s plenty more, as port developers Nixxes Software have used a  Sony blog post to detail quite a few new tech toys – including Rift Apart’s Microsoft DirectStorage 1.2 support.\nDirectStorage is simultaneously one of the most exciting recent developments in gaming hardware, and one of the most underutilised: it basically adapts your PC’s process for reading data from an SSD or hard drive in a way that can massively reduce game loading times, but has so far only made it to prime time in Forspoken. I suppose the upside is that once Rift Apart is out on July 26th, DirectStorage’s compatible games list will increase by 100%?\nRead more",

Revolution! is a joyous mix of both Minesweeper and a roguelite, tasking players with hunting down a deliciously repugnant king through a series of increasingly complex tile maps to enact their titular coup. With all tiles facing down on arrival, you'll need to hop from square to square to flip them over and reveal the king's hiding place before progressing to the next level. But with several of his royal agents stalking the roads and highways, you'll need to choose your route carefully, making good use of your character's unique set of skills to arrive at your final destination of Beebom City. That, and employing a bit of the old Minesweeper noggin, of course. \nYou see, tiles come in two types in Let's! Revolution! The aforementioned road tiles, and surrounding landscape tiles. The latter all have numbers denoting how many road tiles surround it, giving you just enough information to build up a picture of where the road (and the king's lackeys) might be lurking. Take care, though. This lot are a tricksy bunch, and can quite quickly overwhelm if they're revealed too soon and all at once. That's Let's! Revolution! in a nutshell, at least, but the real joy of this run-based rogue comes from its gorgeous presentation and its brilliantly conceived character classes that twist and mould its basic building blocks into fresh new forms each and every time. It's great fun, and I can't get enough of it.\nRead more",

I’ve had a cosy ol’ time taking out all the protagonist's items one by one and placing them in the various places around her rooms. From her childhood bedroom right up until her first house, I love how relaxing and gratifying it is to decorate each room. But after replaying it for this month's RPS Game Club, there’s one section that gave me quite the opposite reaction.\nA big part of Unpacking is learning about the character’s personalities through their objects: what clothes they have in their wardrobes, what items fill their bookshelves, which kitchen utensils make it from move to move, and so on. These contextual clues act as a subtle but incredibly effective story-telling device. There is one level, however, where it’s not all laid-back fun times and it's when the protagonist moves in with her first partner, who I will henceforth be referring to as ‘finance bro boyfriend’ - and wow, he is the absolute worst.

The investigation soon takes you to a remote island engulfed in paranormal goings-on and, well, things take a strange turn. You better look for yourself below.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "When I think back on most of the cinematic platformers I've played recently, it's not the latter part of their genre title I remember most, but the former. The lush camera pans of your Planet Of Lanas, the haunting backdrops of your Somervilles and the gooey, malleable monstrosities of your Insides. These dramatic moments linger in the memory much longer than their respective running and jumping, and if it's a proper platforming challenge I'm after, I usually look elsewhere, swapping cinema for action with your Raymans, Trines and Oris. \nFull Void, on the other hand, is a cinematic run and jumper that manages to strike a good balance between both parts of its personality. Following in the Another World school of gorgeous pixel art meets one-foot-wrong-and-you're-dead-style platforming (albeit with much more generous checkpointing than its 1991 source material), there's a real athleticism in your teen hero's journey to bring down a despotic AI, making its intricate leaps and bounds just as memorable as its down-to-the-wire set pieces.\nRead more",

          "description": "The Ryzen 5 7600X processor might be one of AMD's cheapest options in their Zen 4 lineup, but this chip is still hugely powerful compared to prior Ryzen generations. It takes advantage of its 5nm process and the AM5 socket to hit higher clock speeds, has architectural improvements that raise its single-core prowess, and of course has access to DDR5 memory and PCIe 5.0 add-in cards too. That's made it a strong option for gaming, but a high asking price of $300 at launch - plus expensive motherboards and DDR5 - put it out of reach of most sane budget builds. That's slowly changing as these chips and other components become cheaper, and today the 7600X has hit a new low price in the US: just $200 at Amazon.com, a full $100 off its MSRP and a great deal for a processor with this kind of performance. \nRead more",

If you're just aiming for the minimum requirements, you'll need at least an Intel Core i5-9400F (or the AMD equivalent) and 16GB of RAM.

Although the shake-up could lead to studios receiving the capital they need to execute more ambitious ideas, it also comes at the risk of creating anti-competitive monopolies.\nTechland is one of the latest studios to make headlines, as it has recently been revealed that Tencent is in the process of becoming a majority stakeholder in the studio.\n[caption id=\"attachment_372659\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Techland[/caption]\nTencent and Techland\nFounded in 1991, Techland is a Polish studio most known for the first-person survival horror franchise Dying Light. On July 24, the studio announced that Tencent is in the process of becoming a majority stakeholder in Techland. This move was motivated by the belief that \"the best, boldest dreams can only be achieved while working side-by-side with like-minded friends and strong partners\".\nAlthough it is a big step for Techland, the studio has assured players that it still has its sight on making Dying Light the \"ultimate zombie game experience for players worldwide\". Furthermore, Paweł Marchewka will continue to serve as CEO.\nTencent, a massive Chinese tech and entertainment conglomerate, has its fingers in quite a few pies. In addition to its 40% stake in Fortnite's Epic Games, it also has a 100% stake in Back 4 Blood's Turtle Rock Studios and a 9.99% stake in Ubisoft, to name but a few of its foreign investments.\nMicrosoft has also been growing its stable of gaming studios, with the Activision Blizzard acquisition having been recently approved by the European Union.

Other times, the home port of a notorious quarter-muncher might be rebalanced for the living room, as is the case with Super Smash T.V. or the NES Contra.\nOld ports are also interesting from a design standpoint.

You might remember it from my blockbuster article, “Here are eleven 2022 indie games to look forward to.” It’s now the middle of (checks watch) 2023, and it has finally arrived.\nTime Bandit is the story of having a crappy job and working for the man. In this case, however, the man is exploiting workers and using them to gather time crystals for potentially nefarious purposes.\nhttps://youtu.be/Ug4Uokxc1F0\nBut slow down there since Time Bandit also runs on a real-time clock. Sort of like Pokemon Gold/Silver! Your shift is based on real-world time, and different tasks take different amounts of time. Sometimes you even need to meet characters at a specific time of day that they’ll schedule with you in advance. You’d going to need to rein in that spontaneity if you want to overthrow your capitalist overlords.\nI was hoping to get a review of Time Bandit – Part 1: Appendages of the Machine up at launch, but ironically, I just haven’t had the time. Hopefully, I can circle back to it because I really enjoyed the build that I played last year. I also provided feedback directly to Joel, so I’m eager to see if any of it was incorporated. It’s like I have skin in the game when, in reality, I’m not really much different than any normal commenter.\nTime Bandit – Part 1: Appendages of the Machine is available on PC and Mac via Steam and itch.io starting today.\nThe post Indie embezzlement game Time Bandit releases today on Steam appeared first on Destructoid.",

In Astronaut, players have the task of managing an occult space academy in an uncanny world.\n\"Our team spent over eight years working to make a bizarre moral laboratory of a game, that feels truly unlike anything you've played before,\" said Mike Sennott, Lead Developer on Astronaut: The Best. \"We hope you'll be deeply and delightedly surprised by what you find inside, and that makes all those years worth it.\"\nSennott was the Narrative Designer on the popular indie tactical RPG Wintermoor Tactics Club. The team also released a new launch date announcement trailer showing off Astronaut's weirdness.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbkPomZBxyE\nRunning a culty space academy doesn't look easy\nIn Astronaut: The Best, it's literally your job to guide procedurally generated misfit recruits through a roguelite hodgepodge of scandals and challenges. You can guide your Astronaut team via a variety of methods including lies, witchcraft, and of course some good ole classic hard work. New recruits can be former serial killers, part-time pirates, or even members of the royal family. The team at Universal Happymaker notes that choices will actually have an impact on each recruit as well as their likelihood to succeed.\nThis game is definitely very weird looking, which has really piqued my interest. It's weird looking in an intriguing way. The visuals are uncanny for sure and in some aspects eerily creepy. It's sort of giving me Cultist Simulator vibes with a bit of Homestar Runner between the graphic and comedic style.

You can now nab it there for the price of free.\nI’ve covered He Fucked the Girl Out of Me a couple of times now, but it was something that burrowed under my skin and has lived there since. Being a semi-autobiographical retelling of a slew of problematic topics such as sex work, getting it on Steam is no small matter. For one thing, it gets lumped in with all the 18+ games that have names like Sex Campus Story. I mean sure, minors should probably not play either one, but one has clearly different goals.\nWhile the game is free, there are a few donation options presented as DLC, which I think is kind of neat. Beyond simple game design, Taylor does quite a bit to help the queer game development community.\nAgain, however, I’d like to be clear in saying that you should be careful playing He Fucked the Girl Out of Me and definitely pay attention to the content warnings. Not everyone is going to have such a visceral reaction to the subject matter, but some will. I’d hate for someone to think they are just going to be playing a neat Game Boy Color game and walk away with vicarious trauma.\nYou’ve been warned, but if you still feel like checking out He Fucked the Girl Out of Me, you can get it now on Steam.\nThe post Trauma art game He F—ed the Girl Out of Me releases on Steam appeared first on Destructoid.",

The cheesy (hehe) event is to celebrate the upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem movie that releases on August 2.\nThe Xbox Wireless Controllers come with a built-in scent diffuser shaped like a pizza slice. There's a controller variation for each of the Turtle brothers: Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello, and Michaelangelo. The announcement provided no details on the type of pizza we can smell from the controller. I mean, what exactly are we talking about here? Just cheese? Pepperoni? An aromatic supreme pie? Just say it isn't pineapple.\nThose who need help getting hungry for a pizza while they game can enter to win one of the controllers pretty easily. Simply follow Xbox Game Pass on Twitter and retweet the official Xbox Game Pass sweepstakes tweet. The giveaway starts on July 24 and lasts through August 13. You can find the full list of rules and eligibility details here.\nhttps://twitter.com/XboxGamePass/status/1683492348234199041\nCowabunga, dude!\nThe controllers themselves have pretty cool TMNT-themed skins, but the \"pizza diffuser\" looks a bit off. It kind of looks like one of those plastic doggy squeak toys. This is obviously very gimmicky but I guess it could be cool getting a whiff of pizza-y goodness while playing Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge.\nAlso part of the event is a new TMNT DLC for Minecraft. The turtles-themed DLC allows you to play as any of the four turtles and explore iconic locations such as the Turtle Lair and fight baddies like Krang.\nIf you're not confident you will win one of these limited controllers, there's still a chance to smell the 'za.

          "description": "Ludicrously late notice\nApogee, Nightdive, and New Blood have announced that the console version of Rise of the Triad: Ludicrous Edition will be delayed on console. No date has been given for when we can expect the game to hit Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch, but the PC version is still expected to drop on July 31, 2023.\nRise of the Triad was first released back in 1994 for DOS. It was a pretty ballsy move to release a game built on the Wolfenstein 3D engine after Doom took the forefront of first-person shooters in 1993. To be certain, Rise of the Triad really doesn’t stack up to the monolith it was competing against. But whenever I hear stories of its development, it sounds like Tom Hall and his team had fun creating it.\nhttps://youtu.be/vRdZEY6EL5I\nThat shows in its actual gameplay. What it lacks in fancy technical tricks, it makes up for in its ridiculous design. There are Nazi-esque soldiers begging for their life or playing dead and heat seeking missiles that home in on torches. There are a lot of fun touches that make for a really memorable experience.\nThis is pure speculation, but I wonder if the delay is due to the inclusion of Return of the Triad. This was a fan-made sequel created in the GZDoom Engine. If they wanted to include it in the console versions, they’d have to either port it into the KEX Engine or run it under GZDoom. I’m not sure how simple that is to do in terms of both development and licensing. It’s a worthwhile inclusion, though, as it’s a fantastic little offshoot.\nRise of the Triad: Ludicrous Edition launches on PC on July 31, 2023. The console versions will follow later this year.\nThe post Console versions of Rise of the Triad: Ludicrous Edition delayed appeared first on Destructoid.",

Gone are the days of elaborate statues for physical rewards, and annual loyalty bonuses (which, most of the time, ruled!).

With all of the Zelda, Kirby, and Pikmin rewards on the My Nintendo marketplace at the moment, I figured it was worth reminding people that yes: your points do expire. Here's how to do a quick scan and see when everything will fall off.\n[caption id=\"attachment_393208\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]\nHow to check when your My Nintendo points are expiring\nHead to the My Nintendo website\nScroll all the way down to the bottom of the page and click on the \"point summary\" link\nAt the top of the screen, look for the \"points expiration\" link and click that\nFrom there, you'll be able to see an itemized rolling total of when all of your points are going to expire month-to-month. That includes Platinum points, as well as individualized mobile game points.\nThis is an important screen to check every so often (I just did it and splurged on the new Pikmin rewards!), as you'll want to dump points into rewards if they're going to expire at the end of the month anyway. It's a sneaky way for Nintendo to create point churn, and prevent folks from just playing through Fire Emblem Heroes, amassing thousands of points, and saving them for big-ticket rewards.\nThe post PSA: A lot of My Nintendo rewards are active, so make sure you check when your points expire appeared first on Destructoid.",

My 30-some hours in the game are casual numbers to some, but even still I believe this claim.\n\"For those that love secrets and exploring, no one has seen or obtained 100% of everything #Remnant2 has to offer,\" Cureton tweeted. \"I'm talking about hardcore players with over 400+ hours, reviewers that had early access, even our own internal developers. No one. Remnant 2 has secrets within secrets within secrets. We made sure obtaining 100% Achievements is very player-friendly and then went far beyond that to keep the game rewarding long after you've hit that goal.\"\nhttps://twitter.com/verytragic/status/1682061381141446657\nRandomization probably plays a bit of a role in this\nAlmost everything in Remnant 2 is random. Even at the beginning of the game, the first world you adventure to is not linear. Therefore, some of the secrets in the game probably require specific parameters to be met under the right conditions. Honestly, it's one of the things that makes Remnant 2 so great. Every run is different, creating the opportunity for infinite replayability. Some of the maps also have their own unique side-zones that may hold some clues on discovering these unseen secrets.\nEven though no one has seen everything just yet, I wonder how long this will hold up once the game releases. As of now, there's still a pretty small pool of players that have played.  I'm sure there will be some explorers and completionists that team up to try and hunt down everything there is to find.\nRemnant 2 launches on July 25 on PC, PlayStation  5, and Xbox Series X|S. Those that pre-order the Ultimate Edition get early access and jump into the game on July 21.\nThe post No one has seen 100% of everything in Remnant 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

It sunk an entire studio.  Disney's Treasure Planet and Sinbad: Legend Of The Seven Seas? Many credit them for having killed traditional 2D animation altogether. Hardly the crime any movie pirate would like to be remembered for.\nLuckily, pirates have thrived in the world of gaming — in more ways than one — you could say. Over the course of its entire history, gaming has featured a wide variety of pirate-themed games.

Certain songs have become the theme of generations, and the constant evolution of music, and music creation is still one of the most prevalent forms of expression today. Take someone like Moshibass for example, and his Kirby Otamatone.\n[caption id=\"attachment_392731\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot by Moshibass[/caption]\nKirby Otamatone leads Troupe in Bring Me to Life Cover\nFor those who are unfamiliar, the Otamatone is a portable music synthesizer created in the shape of an eighth note. To play the instrument, you squeeze its head. This is followed by sliding your fingers up and down the \"stem\" to change the pitch. You can also add vibrato to the sounds played by shaking the Otamatone. Its popularity has skyrocketed online, especially thanks to Moshibass' cover of Bring Me to Life by Evanescence.\nThe cover contains a full backing track, with main vocals provided by a Kirby-themed Otamatone Deluxe. Backup vocals are performed by Hello Kitty and Gudetama-themed Otamatones. Moshibass brings their previous knowledge as a musician and music teacher to cleverly translate the lyrics of the classic 2000s song into a silly ballad with cutesy musical notes.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmxLja-DRIw\nIf you've heard the song, you'll be able to hear the lyrics coming from Kirby and the rest of the Otamatones. You can see the video, and Moshibass' other Otamatone covers on their youtube channel. The channel also includes a tutorial on how to play your own Otamatone, as well as tutorials for popular video game songs on guitar, and ukelele.\nThe post This Kirby Otamatone brings angst back with this Bring Me to Life Cover appeared first on Destructoid.",

Names like Li Mei. I don't remember her from any of the games, so I shot over to the awful Mortal Kombat Fandom wiki to get a refresher on this fighter I'd completely forgotten.\nEven after reading her bio, I still don't remember her. But I guess we'll be reacquainted later this year as a new trailer from NetherRealm today confirmed she's coming to Mortal Kombat 1 alongside Tanya, who I do remember from Mortal Kombat X. Both fighters feature heavily in the spot, as does Baraka, who is back as a playable character.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sLJ-xyjMQo\nWith the game still several weeks from launch, NetherRealm decided now is as good a time as any to confirm all the DLC rumors that have been swirling since it was revealed. In a second trailer released on Friday, the developer confirmed the kombatants of what will likely be the first Kombat Pack. Included are:\nOmni-Man (Invincible)\nHomelander (The Boys)\nPeacemaker (Peacemaker, Suicide Squad)\nQuan Chi (Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm)\nErmac (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3)\nTakeda (Mortal Kombat X)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eT-3vhCl6N4\nMortal Kombat 1 releases on September 14 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Switch.

          "description": "Out of Beta, into Early Access\nThe online Action RPG Wayfinder is almost ready for Early Access. After a handful of beta events, Digital Extremes announced Wayfinder will be hitting Early Access on August 15. Founder's Packs will be available in several tiers with each offering access to Wayfinder as well as two seasons of unique rewards. Of course, each founder's pack has its own separate cosmetic rewards as well. The ARPG will launch on both PC (Steam) and PlayStation with full cross-play and cross-save support.\nPublisher Digital Extremes and developer Airship Syndicate also unveiled an all-new playable sharpshooter class called the Venomess: here's the trailer showing off the new class and announcing the upcoming Early Access.\nhttps://youtu.be/0TdDWdfhAMU\nAn interactive Battle Pass that never expires\nEach founder's pack will also grant you access to the Season 1 and 2 Reward Towers. This unique battle pass will allow you to choose your own path toward earning unique seasonal rewards. Unlocks from the Rewards Tower include exclusive characters, Sprays, Charms, pets, and other cosmetics. Interestingly, each season's Battle Pass in Wayfinder never expires allowing players to grind it out how they want and when they want.\nI had the chance to play in the Wayfinders beta and it definitely shows some promise. The fast-paced combat felt quite satisfying. Also, the varying playstyles of each class provide the potential for true class identity and agency. Overall it was way too mission-based for my liking, but that's exactly what Waframe fans are accustomed to. The ability to team up with friends and blast through high-intensity action in an online setting is great, even if it's not quite MMO-like. Even Warframe opened up into the more traditional MMO experience over time, so perhaps Wayfinder will do its own twist with Airship Syndicate at the helm.\nWayfinder hits early access on PC (Steam) and PlayStation on August 15.\nThe post Online ARPG Wayfinder hits Early Access in August appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Grab your popcorn and sit around the campfire\nBlizzard will be addressing all the current Diablo 4 drama today in an aptly-timed Campfire Chat stream. The team confirmed that they plan to talk about the recent 1.1.0 patch that left fans unhappy with the current state of Diablo 4 and led to questions regarding the future of the popular Action RPG. I've read over your comments on various D4 posts in the last few days and want to welcome you in joining me around the campfire!\nThe Diablo 4 Campfire Chat will go live today at 11 a.m. PT / 2 p.m. ET. You can watch along on Twitch or YouTube. In the past, these Campfire Chats typically last between an hour and an hour and a half. There's definitely a lot to talk about, so I'd expect it to be on the longer end.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZuG4Yng4bY\nWhat can we expect?\nMost importantly, Diablo Global Community Development Director Adam Fletcher confirmed they plan to address player feedback regarding patch 1.1.0. There were so many changes in the recent update, so I highly doubt everything will be touched on in this stream. It's likely some of the more glaring issues like the experience and vulnerability changes will be discussed.\nAlso, with Diablo 4 season 1 releasing just yesterday I imagine there will be some discussion in regard to plans for the first post-season update.\nI'll be sure to do a recap of the stream afterward as well. Hopefully, we'll all have some good news!\nUpdate: Wow, what a Campfire Chat!

The former will focus on melee attacks and one-on-one combat while the latter is all about ranged attacks and mobility. A license for Mega Mewtwo X is available now, as part of the Crystal Cave Challenge event that is currently taking place. The license for Mega Mewtwo Y will arrive in mid-august.\nPlayers can fill Mewtwo's Mega gauge via basic attacks and moves. Once the gauge fills up, Mewtwo can Mega Evolve into Mega Mewtwo, gaining new attacks and increased stats before changing back into his normal form.\nMewtwo will join Zacian as the only Legendary Pokemon in Pokemon Unite. (Mew is in the game, but falls under the Mythical classification.) The Pokemon Company reiterated they plan to continue gradually increasing the number of Legendary Pokemon in Unite.\n[caption id=\"attachment_392941\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via The Pokemon Company[/caption]\nNew battle type & Battle Pass 17\nA new type of battle is also coming to Pokemon Unite as part of the Anniversary event. Panic Parade ditches the standard 5v5 battle format and tasks players with working together to protect Tinkaton from a horde of panicking Pokemon.\nBattle Pass 17 is also live now and will run from July 21 until September 11. The primary rewards from the pass are Captain Style: Greeden and Captain Style: Zacian Holowear. There are also some Captain Set Trainer fashion items you can acquire from this season's pass.\nThe new ranked match season is also underway and will run through September 11.

He also assures the studio has full creative freedom. While the Polish company is best known as the maker of the Dying Light series, Call of Juarez, and the original Dead Island, it also has a publishing branch. Titles released under Techland's umbrella include Arise: A Simple Story and Torment: Tides of Numenera.\nThis is business as usual for Tencent, which has dipped its hands into a number of game studios in recent years. It has invested in (or has outright acquired) companies such as Epic Games, From Software, Turtle Rock Studios, Riot Games, Ubisoft, Activision Blizzard, Remedy Entertainment, among others. \n For more on Techland, you can check out this piece of concept art from their new fantasy IP as well as our Dying Light 2 Stay Human review.",

          "description": "Much has been made about Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon’s mech-based gameplay, but a new trailer shines a light on its narrative. To the surprise of no one, though, this new look still packs in plenty of cinematic action. \nDespite the \"VI\" in the title, Fire of Rubicon serves as a reboot. The game unfolds on planet Rubicon in which its most sought-after resource, Coral, was the cause of a disaster that engulfed the planet in flames. Decades later, the now-contaminated planet has been condemned, but the rediscovery of Coral has attracted various factions, sparking a new war on the destroyed world. Players control mercenary C4-621 or \"Raven\" for short, who is thrown into this epic struggle pitting megacorporations, military forces, and other groups against each other. Based on the trailer's somber tone, it won't be pretty. \n\n\nArmored Core VI Fires of Rubicon launches on August 25 for PlayStation/Xbox consoles and PC.

          "description": "Despite launching in less than a month, we haven’t seen too much of Atlas Fallen since it was revealed nearly a year ago. A general overview video released last month gave curious players a primer on what to expect from this world of sand, magic, and monsters. Publisher Focus Entertainment has followed that up with a new gameplay-focused video breaking down the game’s combat.\nThe five-minute video shows off the action RPG's sand-shaping action. Players can equip two main weapons to alternate attacks in fast-paced combat. These include arms like a whip, axe, and even giant fists made of sand. Attacks build momentum, which raises your power and can be spent to unleash flashy special attacks. However, the higher your momentum, the more damage you take, promoting a strategic risk/reward system.\n\n\nThe video also provides a look at customization, showing off Essence Stones. There are over 150 of these skills, which range from aerial attacks to setting traps to firing projectiles. The trailer also shows off the game’s two-player online co-op. Two players can complete Atlas Fallen, including its story campaign, in its entirety together. In fact, the video states some Essence Stones promote cooperative play. \nAtlas Fallen looks promising, and developer Deck13 has a decent track record (The Surge series, Lords of the Fallen), so we hope this information dump at the eleventh hour is a sign of confidence instead of a bad omen. We look forward to seeing how it shapes up when it arrives on August 10 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

Wesley played roughly four hours of the game in a hands-on remote preview to learn more about its open world Oahu, Hawaii, various vehicles, racing playlists, Main Stage mode, and more. \nEnjoy more than 15 minutes of new gameplay from The Crew Motorsport in the latest NGT below: \n\n\nUbisoft Ivory Tower developed both 2014's The Crew and 2018's The Crew 2, and the Lyon, France-based studio returns to developer The Crew Motorfest. Unlike the first two games in the series, which feature maps spanning the entire United States, The Crew Motorfest takes place in just one state: Hawaii. The island of Oahu, Hawaii, to be specific, and it features Honolulu, plenty of beautiful beaches, mountain paths to drift through, and more. \nIn our NGT for The Crew Motorfest, we showcase some gameplay from the Vintage Garage playlist, which is a racing playlist devoted to vintage cars from as far back as the 1950s, the Made in Japan playlist, which is all about Japanese street racing, and a boat race on the ocean surrounding the island. \nFor more about The Crew Motorfest, read Game Informer's full preview here. \nThe Crew Motorfest hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on September 14, 2023. \nFor more previews and discussions of some of the biggest games of 2023 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Ra Ra Boom, Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons, Mortal Kombat 1, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, XDefiant, and Sea of Stars.\nAre you excited for The Crew Motorfest?

          "description": "Sega has released the opening animation for Sonic Superstars ahead of the game's release later this fall. \nSonic Superstars is a modernized 2D adventure with four-player co-op, which you’ll need to utilize to play as Sonic the Hedgehog, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy. Its announcement was one of the biggest surprises of Summer Game Fest, and after getting to go hands-on with it during SGF’s Play Days event, we came away excited about the blue blur’s latest adventure. \nNow, Sega has released the game's opening animation. Check it out for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Sonic Superstars features a Sonic CD-esque opening, with its bright blue skies and emerald green plains. After dashing through some enemies, Sonic joins his buddy Tails before teaming up with the rest of the Sonic Superstars playable cast, Knuckles and Amy. Together, the four prepare to take Eggman on before speeding toward the screen. \nThe trailer ends with the news that if you preorder the game, you’ll receive an “exclusive Lego Eggman in-game character skin, acrylic display stand, and reversible cover.” This preorder bonus will go great with the other Lego Sonic Superstars skins coming to the game as DLC. \nSega has yet to reveal a release date for Sonic Superstars but it’s due out sometime this fall on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.\nWhile waiting to learn more, read about how Microsoft, at one point, considered acquiring Sega, and then read about why we think Sonic’s latest outing, Sonic Origins Plus, is two steps forward and one step back. \nAre you picking up Sonic Superstars on day one?

As for why, publisher Humble Games and developer Summerfall Studios says it is taking the extra week to work on performance parity across all platforms and to allow players the space to play Larian Studios’ upcoming RPG, Baldur’s Gate 3. \n\n\nHere’s what Humble Games and Summerfall Studios have to say about the Stray Gods delay: \nFor the uninitiated, Stray Gods is a hand-illustrated role-playing musical where players will decide lines in songs, similar to picking dialogue choices in an RPG. The music is composed by Grammy-nominated composer Austin Wintory (Journey, The Pathless, Assassin’s Creed Syndicate), Tripod, and Montaigne. \nThese songs are performed by a cast filled with names you might recognize, too, like Troy Baker, Ashley Johnson, Rahul Kohli, Janina Gavankar, Felicia Day, and more. Laura Bailey voices the lead, Grace, a college dropout in the game’s modern fantasy world granted the power of a Muse. This power is what Grace uses to “find out the truth behind her predecessor’s death before time runs out,” according to a press release.\nStray Gods: The Role-Playing Musical hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on August 10, 2023. \nWill you check out Stray Gods: The Role-Playing Musical next month?

That finally changes as the 1995 classic is getting spruced up for a modern, international re-release.\nFor any Americans thinking, “But we got the first Clock Tower on PlayStation,” we actually didn’t. The 1997 game known as “Clock Tower,” which did release in the West, was really Clock Tower 2 and was titled as such in Japan (watch us play it in this classic episode of Replay).\nThe actual first game arrived on Super Famicom (SNES) and stars Jennifer Simpson, an orphan adopted by the Barrows family only to find that a murderous stalker called the Scissorman is terrorizing their mansion. As a point-and-click adventure, you use a mouse cursor to guide Jennifer and interact with your surroundings to solve puzzles and find clues while evading the Scissorman. The game also features multiple endings. Clock Tower is considered one of the forefathers of survival horror and has been ported to different platforms, such as PC and the Wii/Wii U eShops, several times in Japan. \n\n\nWayforward is handling this port, which is being made using Limited Run Games’ Carbon Engine. As discussed in the developer diary video above, improvements include the game's first official English localization (along with multiple language options), a new animated intro, motion-comic cutscenes, and a new vocalized theme song by famed anime and Silent Hill singer Mary McGlynn. It also includes an art gallery, save states, and other modern tweaks. \nClock Tower is coming early next year for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC. Limited Run Games is also releasing premium physical versions of the game.",

Wesley played through the demo multiple times, using each character to take down AI and robots alike. He, Marcus, and Kyle discuss the game's visual style, use of lanes in combat, fully-voiced characters, and more. \nEnjoy roughly 12 minutes of all new Ra Ra Boom gameplay in the latest NGT below: \n\n\nIn 2008, Chris Bergman, who later co-founded Gylee Games and now works as its CEO, bought the domain to raraboom.com. Today, that site takes you to the Steam page for Ra Ra Boom, the beat 'em up featured in our latest installment of New Gameplay Today. Gylee Games started work on the game back in 2019, before the resurgence of beat 'em up games, but Bergman is stoked about said resurgence. He calls it a \"rising tides raise all ships\" scenario. \nAfter playing through this demo multiple times, I'm excited for Ra Ra Boom's full release. Its inclusion of lanes has fixed my largest problem with beat 'em ups: my inability to properly target and hit enemies. Add in the fully voiced characters, beautiful art style, fun cast of ninja cheerleaders, and an emphasis on story that's somewhat rare in the genre, and I'm ready to smash some robots. \nRa Ra Boom hits PC early next year.\nFor more previews and discussions of some of the biggest games of 2023 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons, Mortal Kombat 1, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective, Eternights, Bramble: The Mountain King, Humanity, Afterimage, Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster Collection, XDefiant, Sea of Stars, and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.\nEditor's Note: This article has been updated to reflect that Ra Ra Boom will launch early 2024. \nAre you going to check out Ra Ra Boom later this year?

          "description": "Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden is an upcoming action RPG from Don’t Nod, makers of Life is Strange and Vampyr, which was first revealed at The Game Awards last December. The upcoming ghost-busting adventure has a new trailer revealing a November 7 launch date. \nThe game stars Antea Duarte and Red mac Raith, two lovers who serve as Banishers, those who protect the living from the lingering spirits of the dead. Unfortunately, Antea has become a ghost herself and must work alongside Red to find a way to bring herself back to life. Along the way, they’ll explore New Eden, a North American settlement teeming with supernatural dangers, and player combat threats using Red’s conventional weaponry and Antea’s spectral abilities. Players will also interact with New Eden’s residents in choice-driven conversations that steer the course of the narrative, namely in deciding whether to fulfill their duty as a Banisher or sacrifice that oath to restore Antea’s mortality.  \n\n\nBanishers: Ghosts of New Eden will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. It's the second of three games on Don't Nod's 2023 launch schedule, having released Harmony: The Fall of Reverie last month and it has a meditative climbing game called Jusant slated for this fall.",

Wesley played through one of the stages in the game to get a feel for how classic fighters Billy and Jimmy feel and the three discuss their thoughts on these characters, the visual style, the combat, and more.\nEnjoy nearly 10 minutes of new Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons gameplay in the latest NGT below: \n\n\nDeveloper Secret Base and publisher Modus Games announced Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons earlier this summer with a special trailer that you can watch here. The game is set in New York City after it's been destroyed by nuclear war. Brawlers Billy and Jimmy set out to take back what remains from the violent gangs that have since taken over. However, they won't be doing it alone because the game features a roster of 13 playable fighters, including love interest Marian, newcomer Uncle Matin, and more. \nSecret Base says the beat 'em up features \"seamless tag team abilities and a multitude of strategies for devastating combos, defensive, and offensive moves.\" Players can swap characters on the fly, which you can see in the NGT above, as needed in combat. \nDouble Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on July 27. It will feature two-player local co-op at launch. Online co-op is set to arrive later in a post-launch update. \nFor more previews and discussions of some of the biggest games of 2023 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Mortal Kombat 1, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective, Eternights, Bramble: The Mountain King, Humanity, Afterimage, Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster Collection, XDefiant, Sea of Stars, and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.\nAre you going to check out Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons later this month?

Now, shortly after the ruling, Microsoft has announced it will pause its appeal efforts against the Competition and Markets Authority in the U.K. so that it and the CMA can negotiate. \nBack in April, the UK regulatory body blocked Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard over cloud gaming concerns. With a July 18 deadline for the acquisition, Microsoft theoretically needs to either mark the U.K. out of its market as it relates to this purchase or negotiate a deal with the CMA to quell the regulator's concerns. Microsoft was previously set to appear in court to appeal the CMA's block on July 28. According to Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith, that won't be happening now as the two parties will instead attempt to negotiate a deal that satisfies both. \nOur statement on the mutual request with the CMA for a pause of our appeal in the UK: pic.twitter.com/8Aky2IJjxS\nJuly 11, 2023\nIt's important to note that the Competition Appeal Tribunal still needs to either approve or deny this request, as noted by The Verge, but the former seems incredibly likely. In a statement received by The Verge, the CMA said it is \"ready to consider any proposals from Microsoft to restructure the transaction in a way that would address the concerns set our in our Final Report,\" likely alluding to its concerns over cloud gaming (concerns that Microsoft disagrees with). \nGame Informer has reached out to the CMA for a statement regarding Smith's announcement and will update the story if a comment or statement is received. \nWhat do you think this means for Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard?

It’s set to release Let Them Come: Onslaught on PC via Steam Early Access in the first quarter of 2024. Let Them Come: Onslaught puts players behind the gun of a lone survivor on an alien planet who must survive hordes of creatures by activating nukes to blow up the planet. \nCheck out the teaser trailer for Let Them Come: Onslaught for yourself below:\n\n\nTuatara Games says the game features dynamic weather, and a wide range of weapons, including a flamethrower, laser beam, electric grenade, orbital strikes, and more. As you mow down hordes of aliens, you can upgrade your soldier with increased health, defense, reduced weapon cooldowns, and shields you can activate on the battlefield. To obtain these upgrades, you spend XP you earn on each run.\n“We are huge fans of this emerging gameplay experience, and are thrilled to reveal our love letter to the games that inspired us,” Tuatara Games founder Klemen Lozar writes in a press release. “Using our team’s VFX expertise, survivors can expect to fight for their lives through adrenaline-inducing experiences that have the best visuals of the genre.” \n\nLet Them Come: Onslaught also features roguelite elements, meaning a lot will be lost in between each run. However, credits collected on the battlefield stay with you, and you can spend them on permanent upgrades in the Armory. \nTuatara Games says Let Them Come: Onslaught hits Steam Early Access sometime in Q1 of 2024. It will cost $4.99. The team says, “The decision to launch first on Early Access comes from [the] continued knowledge in incorporating improvements to ensure the final 1.0 launch is as optimized as possible.”",

And of course, this was Adibou's first appearance! Although the floppy release has him speak the same strange gibberish as heard in the Goblins series, he is still the patient and funny learning partner that he's remembered for being in later games.\nScummVM supports all of the game's releases, from the initial 16-color floppy ones to later 1994 CD versions with richer graphics and sound effects. So dig out your dusty Adibou disks, get a ScummVM daily development build, and start collecting sweets while completing math and reading exercises! Please also contact us if you own a version ScummVM is not yet aware of, and report to the issue tracker any problem you may encounter.\nAs much as ScummVM aims to replicate the original gaming experience, there is one feature we are unfortunately unable to support. When hardworking children complete their virtual sweets collection, a message invites them to mail a floppy disk with their savegame to Coktel Vision, who would send them a parcel containing Coktel goodies and actual sweets! So if you are introducing children to Adibou through ScummVM, be prepared to go to the nearest shop and buy some candy for when they finish the game!\n>",

Today is the day I removed the last few DNS entries pointing to AWS’s DNS servers, and I am proud to mention that (almost) all traffic is now routed via Cloudflare (and we aren’t even receiving sponsoring to say so). In this post I want to take you with me why this migration was needed, what the benefits are, and why you possibly care. But in short summary: (Much) smaller monthly bill as AWS charges insane amounts for bandwidth. Faster download speeds for you (ranging from the in-game content service to downloading the game from our website). Easier maintainability of our infrastructure with thanks to Pulumi.
