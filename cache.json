Take 12 blanks, doodle some faces and landscapes, and lo, you have a procedural narrative generator. Make some duplicates, invent a few rules and lo, you have systems. \r\n\n\r\nConversely, the great drawback of cards - especially in those roguelite deckbuilders people have been churning out since Slay The Spire - is that everything can be reduced to them. For example: last night, I played a round of Fungi with my partner, Fungi being a charming tabletop foraging sim in which you gather scrumptious chantarelles and boletus from the forest floor. This morning I resumed playing Breachway, out now in early access, in which you guide a starship through a series of wartorn solar systems, with battles unfolding as a turn-based exchange of cards corresponding to ship components. \r\n\n \nRead more",

The second tool I obtained was a trumpet. It doesn’t really work like a trumpet, and it does things no regular trumpet could or should do. I got a trowel next. Here’s the thing about the trowel: it’s a pretty good trowel. Nothing fancy. But recently, I keep digging up… objects. Objects most peculiar. I’ve got the weekend to sort this garden, and a cosy little shed to sleep in, so I really should just get on with it. Again, though, I must reiterate: I keep digging up… objects.\nI go to clean some rubbish from the bathroom. I interact with the mirror and the game says: “You do not see anything in the mirror”. I take a note that says: I do not see anything in the mirror. I check the game again and no, I still do not see anything in the mirror. Sure it’s fine. Just a shit mirror, probably. They should get it replaced. What good is a mirror you can’t see anything in?\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Look out, it's Spiders. It's fun to write about Spiders, because you get to frighten people for a moment, before they realise you're talking about the game development studio, Spiders. They have just released GreedFall 2: The Dying Land into early access. For those who don't remember the first GreedFall, it was a colonial-styled RPG about landing on the magical shores of another continent and getting into scrapes with monsters and frontiersfolk. This time the story is furthering the fantasy Columbian exchange by putting you in the role of a native who's been uprooted against their will and taken to the \"old world\". The game's release comes against a backdrop of dissatisfaction in the studio. But workers have gained some concessions in talks. \nRead more",

          "description": "For years, a dangerous and charismatic game has evaded the grasp of many designers. Some say it doesn't exist, that no publisher would ever back it. I'm talking about the one city block RPG that Warren Spector has often mentioned. Sure, we've seen a few usual suspects already - Deus Ex Mankind Divided, Disco Elysium, even Else: Heart.Break - they all grimace in the line-up but nothing ever sticks. Now, out of the gloom of indie development, comes another perp ready to have his mugshot taken. Shadows Of Doubt is an open world detective sim that comes perilously close to being our guy. Its clothes, stature, gait, and fingerprints match the description of what Spector often describes. And yet, if you tilt your head, something is just a little off. The game isn't confined to one block. It's not an RPG precisely. And its simulation has plenty of bugs, jank, and unintentional comedy. But after all this time, in the absence of a smoking gun, shouldn't we just put this guy in the slammer and call the case closed? I say yes, let's. Officers! Arrest this game, it's brilliant. \nRead more",

Yes!\nI’m therefore somewhat unnerved to report that my enthusiasm has been tempered significantly by actually playing it. I’ve since used all the straws I’ve clutched at to spell out \"It’s just a demo\" on my floor, but the fear remains that Crimson Desert’s fantastical open-world exploration is going to be interrupted by regular bouts of twangy, unwieldy, unsatisfying combat.\nRead more",

In the original you controlled the titular Mickey Mouse who, armed with a magical paintbrush (wieldable by waving the Wiimote about), could paint or rub out surfaces to solve puzzles. It was the work of Junction Studios led by Warren Spector, best known for being The Deus Ex Guy. No, sadly Mickey could not nano-augment his brush for better target acquisition, nor project laser-guided anti-tank rockets from his podgy white mitts.\nAnd no, Rebrushed doesn't let him do anything of these either. Clearly a missed opportunity. But is it better nonetheless? With an updated look, some added secrets, more moves for Mickey, and controller/M&K support, I'd say longtime Mickey heads will adore this nostalgia trip. For total newcomers like me, I'd say it's a platformer that's certainly charming and clever and wonderfully experimental, but a bit flat in places too.\nRead more",

Sadly, it’s still no first-rate adaptation, neglecting numerous PC features and giving low-end systems an even deeper kick in the plums.

Then I hit some puzzles and thought, \"Ain't no kid figuring this out\".\nThen it hit me. It struggles to balance the fine line between being approachable for tiny tots and layered enough for people who've graduated from \"goo goo ga ga\" to \"oo oo aa aa my back hurts\".

          "description": "You can't travel back to the 1980s. But what if I told you it was possible to gently warp your memories of that time? UFO 50 is a kart of 50 games that once existed for an old computer system, all lovingly restored by a gang of coders. The old console, of course, is a fiction. The LX-I never existed. But it's a fun pseudo-history against which to create a grab bag of small games (some throwaway, others mighty) all designed with a distinct 80s look. It's an exercise in adhering to an aesthetic. Like an oil painter working with a limited range of colours, the developers of this bundle have stuck to a 32-colour equivalent of the Zorn palette. Yet play a little of each game, and you start to sense the smirk of chronos. These games aren't stuck in the past, but they are enjoying a holiday there. \nRead more",

          "description": "Having played the opening hour of Altus’ Metaphor: ReFantazio – now mere weeks away from its October 11th launch – I think it’s high time to correct a games previewing injustice. Namely, that the majority of its pre-release buzz has centred around its proximity to Persona, and not its far more entertaining quality of having the most gleefully bizarre RPG enemy design this side of Elden Ring’s horn-tooting orbpeople.\nRead more",

          "description": "Why is every blockbuster video game now some kind of live service game? Speaking as a clueless idiot, the explanation I find most convincing is that it's an attempt to bridge the gap between the returns publishers want from video games, versus how much we're able or willing to pay upfront. \"Triple-A\" projects now cost exorbitant sums to develop, partly thanks to wider economic inflation, but also because publishers have spent decades teaching players that every sequel has to be More and Shinier. Premium game prices have not risen in proportion, and investors want growth, as they do.\nLive service games sneak around this difficulty by dragging out the time we spend playing them. Whether premium or free-to-play, they seek to install themselves as habits by means of regular, planned updates and additions. This is time that can be monetised by way of a subscription model, time in which other products may be sold to you, like skins and paintjobs, and time that becomes a commodity in itself, \"engagement\", which can be transmuted and exploited to various end. I'm not sure it's ever been expressed this way in any press release boast about longevity, but the unspoken principle/logical extrapolation seems to be that ideally, a live service game should keep us plugged in and plugging away till we die.\n Read more",

          "description": "Strange Scaffold’s newly released FPS I Am Your Beast is very fun for quite a few reasons, but chief among them is a deep appreciation for the poetry of good videogame violence. I’m not using the big P word just to throw out an overly worthy comparison to something we might associate with craft or beauty, but as a nod toward the game’s playful application of what I previously called ‘a euphoric splurge of murderous game verbiage’ one morning where I had clearly eaten my wordy Weetabix. The way its hurled knives and curb stomps and inexplicable decapitations flow together have an assonant, almost Suessian quality to them.\nBut it’s also, well, just a bit like Mad Libs. You play as Harding, a man who’s mythical lethality is established very early on. The showing is there in the moment to moment, but the telling is conveyed through cute tricks like how everyone you meet is so deeply afraid of Harding that they loudly keep track of exactly what weapon he’s holding at all times. The Mad Libs comes in through the fact that you can draw Harding a route between A and B, and it’s a given that multiple heads are going to come unstuck from necks along the way. You’re sort of just casually filling in the verbs that seem the most fun to you in the moment. One of the verbs is ‘hornet’. Hornet is a verb now.\nRead more",

Yes, I am the kind of wizard who hurls a bunny rabbit, if there are no boulders to spare.\nHappily, it transpires that Proletariat have resurrected their creation and handed it over to posterity in the shape of a free standalone Community Version, available on Itch.io.

The announcement was made during the developer's block at Tokyo Game Show along with a teaser trailer. \n\n\nVia SNK OFFICIAL\n\n\nComing just days after Fatal Fury protagonist Terry Bogard's release in Street Fighter 6, the news that Capcom characters are crossing over into SNK's intellectual properties as well, lit the fighting game community on fire. \n\n\nBeloved YouTuber Maximilian Dood's hilarious reaction to the trailer is already being memed into oblivion, and questions of what's next in this working relationship between two fighting game titans are swirling in the rumor pool.\n\n\nVia Maximilian Dood\n\n\nFighting game players, especially of the older generation, are familiar with past crossovers between Capcom and SNK, such as the Capcom vs. SNK games and SNK vs Capcom: SVC Chaos. These crossover titles hold a legendary reputation and were foundational in the development of the FGC. They run so deep in the community that the CvS games held spots at EVO when it was still called Battle by the Bay.\n\n\n2003 was the last time gamers received a full crossover fighting game from the two developers, but with Terry and Mai Shiranui in SF6 and Ken and Chun in Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, it's very likely one is in the works. But the Street Fighter crossover isn't the only one SNK is working on presently, as the company strangely announced soccer star Ronaldo's involvement in its new title just one day before that.\n\n\nFatal Fury is available for pre-order on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, and PC before its release on April 24, 2025.\n\nThe post Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves adds two Street Fighter legends to the roster appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "EA FC 25 is now available worldwide on PC and consoles, but the servers have run into rough weather on the opening night.\n\n\nShortly after the release of the RTTK promo on Friday, September 27, many players reported that they were unable to log into Ultimate Team. Despite waiting in the in-game queue, several members have been kicked out of the line. This has caused a lot of irritation for some who have been wanting to open the packs and play the different modes.\n\n\nEA Sports address about EA FC 25 server issues\n\n\nIt didn't take long for EA Sports to take notice of the issues plaguing the servers. An official tweet has also been sent out, informing the players about the current problems. This incident is pretty similar to what happened after the release of the web app. For nearly an hour, players were unable to use the web app as the servers were out of order.\n\n\n\n\nThe early access period has largely been free of any problems for the Ultimate Edition users. As the player count has increased following the global release, it appears the servers might have run out of capacity. This isn't uncommon and has happened with previous FC titles as well.\n\n\nThere's little you can do in the meantime, as any potential fix has to come from the side of the developers. This year, EA Sports has introduced a virtual queue, which appears if the servers have heavy traffic. Unfortunately, I, like many others, was kicked out unceremoniously. Usually, your queue waiting time will increase in such cases.\n\n\nWhile I have had problems accessing Ultimate Team, you can always enjoy the offline modes like Manager Career. There are some interesting additions that EA Sports has made to the mode this year, and the added realism is sure to delight all.\n\nThe post Is EA FC 25 down? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "City Connection has announced via Twitter (thanks, Time Extension) that they’re bringing three games from Jaleco’s Famicom catalog to the Nintendo Switch as part of the JALECOlle, er, collection. These are joining Bio Warrior Dan (which was released this week), Yokai Club, and Pinball Quest. One of the announced games never made it to North America, and the other two did with entirely redone graphics.\n\n\nThe games are Saiyuuki World, Pizza Pop, and Magic John. Saiyuuki World did make it to the NES, and that was by completely changing the visuals to make Whomp ’Em. The same goes for Magic John, which was localized as Totally Rad. 1992’s Pizza Pop never did, however.\n\n\n\n\nPizza Pop, I’m mostly familiar with through Game Center CX. I remember immediately looking it up after watching the episode, but a loose cartridge goes for upwards of $100 Canadian loonies. That’s partially why this announcement caught my attention, I’ve wanted to play it myself ever since witnessing Arino power through it.\n\n\nThe City Connection ports will likely follow the JALECOlle format, which are essentially enhanced ROMs. Beyond just playing the game, they have a bunch of quality-of-life additions. Previous releases also included subtitles, which is a pretty nifty way of handling translation without having to edit the game’s character sets.\n\n\nAs I’ve mentioned, there’s no word on whether or not these games will make it to Switch in North America. Previous games in the JALECOlle series have made it over here, so I’d say the chances are very high that we’ll see them.\n\n\nSaiyuuki World, Pizza Pop, and Magic John are coming to Switch, but no release date has been announced.\n\nThe post A trio of obscure but rad Famicom Jaleco games are coming to Switch appeared first on Destructoid.",

The news was announced via a New York Times interview published Thursday, generating further excitement for Ghost of Yotei. \n\n\nGhost of Tsushima sales numbers are great ahead of its sequel\n\n\nSucker Punch Productions' Ghost of Tsushima has reached the milestone four years after its release on PS4. It has since received a Director's Cut edition on PS5 (which comes with the DLC expansion), and a recently launched PC version in May that received a Very Positive score on Steam. It also released a multiplayer mode, possibly enticing more players to get into this adventure title.\n\n\nBack on July 15, 2022, Sucker Punch reported on X that 9.73 million copies were sold. This means that the PC launch, plus additional sales on PS4 and PS5 has resulted in more than three million copies shipped since. \n\n\nLikely in response to the critical and commercial success of the first game, PlayStation revealed the game's sequel, Ghost of Yotei. It features a new female protagonist played by Erika Ishii (Apex Legends, Destiny 2), who explores the region of Ezo (now known as Hokkaido) and the stunning areas surrounding Mount Yotei. \"Atsu sets out on a journey in the lands surrounding Mount Yōtei, an area filled with sprawling grasslands, snowy tundras, and unexpected dangers,\" said the PlayStation Blog.\n\n\n\n\n“Being in this incredibly beautiful park with jagged cliffs and water, yet all the time being aware there were dangerous bears, was electrifying,\" said creative director Nate Fox to The New York Times.\n\n\nThe game's trailer already has over five million views on YouTube. PS5 players can check out Ghost of Yotei when it launches sometime in 2025.\n\nThe post Ghost of Tsushima sells over 13 million copies worldwide appeared first on Destructoid.",
