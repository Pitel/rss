          "description": "Flutter bye.\nOver the past few years, there’s been a rise in ‘cozy’ games popping up in the indie space, offering an alternative to the typically achievement-based design of pretty much everything else. While these games do require a different mindset due to their generally short nature and simplistic gameplay, there’s something to be said about immersing in something more focused on delivering a brief, simple, and relaxing experience. Flutter Away from Runaway is the latest cozy game to grace the Switch, and while it doesn’t set any new standards for the genre, it’s still a decent experience.\nFlutter Away could be best described as a 'walking sim' with just a hint of Pokémon Snap mixed in there. You play as a city-dwelling woman taking a solo camping trip to a rainforest for a few days, primarily to interact with the extensive butterfly population there. Over the five days of your trip, which together last about an hour in real-time, you’ll hunt three new species of butterfly each day to photograph and document. To get the butterflies to appear, you have to fulfill a series of simple objectives, such as helping a capybara get fruit out of a tree or setting up a campsite, all of which are fulfilled by a point-and-click interaction. The total play area is roughly the size of an actual campsite, so finding the next objective is usually a pretty straightforward process. There are also a handful of optional hidden objectives to fulfill along the way, such as photographing tree frogs.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Tolkien's 'The Hobbit' had already been on shelves for over 60 years. It should come as no surprise, then, to assume that the iconic fantasy title would have some influence on Nintendo's own N64 adventure title.\nAccording to Did You Know Gaming, however, who recently trawled through an extensive amount of old Nintendo interviews, Ocarina of Time was originally set to include its own original character called 'Hobbit'. This was revealed in an interview with Shigeru Miyamoto himself, who explained that the role of the Deku Scrubs was originally intended for a separate character who would tell stories, sell items to Link, and more.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

At retailers such as Currys, customers could bag a brand new PS5 console with the game included at a price of £399.99, though it appears that this discount is now no longer valid at the time of writing, so it'll be interesting to see where Lego Star Wars winds up next week.\nSwitch maintains a strong showing this week, with FIFA 23, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom all taking the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th spot respectively. FIFA 23 sold the most on the Switch this week, making up 40% of the overall console split.

It's a sobering feeling, therefore, when you beat the game's final boss and roll credits only for the newly unlocked completion percentage on your Purah Pad to remind you that you still have 70% of the game left to complete.\nSuch is the sheer size of Tears of the Kingdom, that pouring ~50 hours into the main story is hardly scratching the surface of the full experience on offer.

Pre-release hype and online opinion will almost certainly influence your choice, but the image on the cover on the box is unlikely to carry quite as much weight. We're not saying that modern games have poor covers – it's just that the industry has moved on, and many games are sold digitally, reducing the impact of good box artwork.\nBack in the '90s, before the internet arrived and games got hyped months (if not years) ahead of their eventual release, box artwork was so important when it came to selling a game that Western publishers would go as far as to commission entirely new cover imagery when localising Japanese games, and, in some cases, all three major regions (Japan, North America and Europe) would get different box artwork.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

You only have a few seconds to pick one and dive through, sweating in the knowledge that each door leads to a confusing network of corridors that exist wholly apart from each other - that each door not opened is a route to an Elsewhere you are doomed to never know, unless you're commissioned to do a, haha, \"retrospective\" 10 years later.\nThis summer, in my previous dishonourable capacity as a freelancer, I barged through the doors marked \"Zelda\" and \"Final Fantasy 16\", then spent a frantic moment trying to force the \"Baldur's Gate 3\" door to open, before giving up and throwing myself under a heap of unedited features. Now, in the relative lull before the monster named Starfield crashes through the ceiling (yes, I know, I'm mixing my scenarios - it's the end of the day and I'm tired), I emerge from the heap reborn as RPS News Editor, and peer back fearfully at some of the doors I left unopened.

In unravelling how individual agents - households, businesses or city services - function within the simulation, the post also touches on the topic of homelessness, a subject the 2014 game left unaddressed.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "There are loads of good Steam Deck games – as in, games that happen to play well on a Steam Deck, even if they were originally crafted around desktop hardware and intended to be poked around with a mouse and keyboard. This is a joy of the portable PC in itself: that if you already have a populated Steam library, a box-fresh Deck will immediately have a selection of familiar favourites to install at no extra cost. \nStill. While the Steam Deck doesn’t do exclusives, it does have a killer app. Nearly a year and a half after Valve surprise-launched Aperture Desk Job alongside their handheld, the comedy tech demo remains unsurpassed as a playable introduction to the hardware. Again, there are thousands of compatible games, but if you’ve just recently grabbed a Steam Deck (perhaps via the new official refurb scheme), Aperture Desk Job could hardly be more perfect as an inaugural install.\nRead more",

Will you learn something? Will it occupy your waking thoughts until it's over? Is the commitment of everyone involved assured? Yes. But would describe the experience as restful? Extremely debatable.\nHammerwatch 2 is out today, and it's kind of an isometric RPG that you can play in multiplayer, and which is at base kind of hacky-and-slashy, but has stacking complexity the more you play. It's like paying for ex-special forces lads to read a choose your own adventure book to you, but they get really into doing the voices. I feel comfortable describing the pixel art as \"adorable\", and it makes everything seem like it's a cute little miniature you can hold in your hand. Hence Mighty Max, which was a key part of my childhood. I don't want to say that Hammerwatch 2 is easy, because that isn't quite right and there's some jank lurking in there. But what it is, is easy to get a handle on. It has also functioned as a way of reintegrating my diseased Faerûined mind back into normal society.\nRead more",

RIGHT, ONTO SPOILER TERRITORY.\nI met this really nice bard in Baldur's Gate 3 called Alfira the other day. She was perched on a rock, swinging a sweet medley to a couple of squirrels. Being the bard Edders Sheeran, I wandered over and listened to her perform. She kept getting stuck on some verses, so I helped her fill in the blanks. Then things went Disney, as the camera pulled away and circled her as she performed a beautiful ballad, one dedicated to her late teacher. She seemed content, belting out the ballad. The squirrels, it turns out, thought her voice was awful.\nAnyway, she took me by surprise much later on as I slew the last of some goblin leaders. She snuck into danger just to say she wanted to join our adventures; see the world! I, Edders Sheeran, was thankful to have such a ray of sunshine enter the camp. \"Of course, we'd love to have you,\" I replied. What could possibly go wrong?\nRead more",

The horrors are sort of demi-gods who you occasionally threaten you with plague unless you satisfy some demand. The alternative is to attack them, which the game stresses is extremely dangerous.

Each realm has a different layout, architecture and ambience, and you'll need to alternate between them to expose routes and bypass obstacles, as indicated by clumps of ashen butterflies, making your way back to Axiom by means of an Effigy of Emergence.\nYou're also dropped into Umbral when you die, which gives you another chance to bump off whatever it is that slew you; die a second time, and you'll have to restart from one of the game's Vestige bonfires. Another thing to worry about: the longer you spend in Umbral, realm of death and despair, the more numerous the monsters that spawn from its shadows. I'm hoping the two-worlds mechanic will usefully mutate the game's many debts to Dark Souls into a brand new playstyle (though as Ed Superior noted in his Lords of the Fallen hands-on, it stands up pretty well as a straight Souls clone). It already poses some fun possiblities for the ever-thorny question of multiplayer.\nRead more",

That sentiment was only solidified by its Steam Next Fest demo last year, which left Katharine impressed by its compelling combat and rodent fantasy setting. It’s been quite the journey for the indie RPG, but we won’t have to wait much longer to see what Small Saga has to offer in full, as it finally has a release date. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "For all the big-budget GeForce graphics cards, it’s the firmly mainstream XX60 models that must surely keep the lights on at Nvidia HQ. A glimpse at the current Steam hardware survey reveals that the RTX 3060, RTX 2060, and GTX 1060 are all within the top four most-used GPUs – with the RTX 3060’s laptop version at number five. These are important cards, and messing up the next one would be a disaster.\nThe RTX 4060 is not a disaster. Ultimately, it a very capable 1080p graphics card, a technical upgrade on the RTX 3060, and (unlike several other RTX 40 series GPUs) arrives at a reasonable price. But it probably doesn’t deserve the apparent immortality of its predecessors, with only modest gen-on-gen performance gains and a heavy reliance on DLSS (including DLSS 3) to expand that difference.\nRead more",

          "description": "In the picturesque Regency town of Leamington Spa, a debutante has entered the local high society of AAA game developers. Named Maverick Games, it’s led by the former director of Forza Horizon 5 - a creative risk-taker named Mike Brown. “Games are made in a very certain way that brings with it real security,” Brown told GamesIndustry.biz in January. “We know that if we do these things in a row, we will hit this date and the game will come out. I think there are other ways where you can still hit that date, but also do a load of new things on the way.”\r\n\n\r\nOne of the new things Maverick is backing is Jamie Brittain, lead writer on the studio’s unannounced open world game. Brittain has never worked on a videogame before. Yet any millennial who grew up in the UK will undoubtedly be familiar with Skins, the epochal teen drama he co-created with his dad, Bryan Elsley.\r\n\n \nRead more",

If you're new to the much-imitated Vampire Survivors format, the idea is to steer an auto-attacking character around a map that is slowly invaded by increasingly hazardous waves of foes, levelling up as you go. Think of it as a bullet hell shooter, but set to the tune of a walking sim. At first, anyway: at higher levels, Vampire Survivors is a perfectly withering experience, for all its initial glacial pace.\nRead more",

          "description": "Game designer, sometime Gears of War frontman and nowadays, comic book author Cliff Bleszinski would very much like Epic to make another Jazz Jackrabbit. In case you're unfamiliar, or disgracefully young, Jazz Jackrabbit was a platform game for MS-DOS, published in 1994 - it was Bleszinski's first project as a designer for then-named Epic MegaGames. He worked on the game alongside coder Arjan Brussee, who would later found Guerrilla Games before moving to Visceral Studios and finally, reuniting with Bleszinski to launch Bosskey Productions, the ill-fated creator of the generally rather decent Lawbreakers. Cor, people don't half move around in this industry.\nI never played Jazz Jackrabbit - if memory serves, the first in the series launched during a particularly cursed/blessed (delete as appropriate) part of my early youth, when my gaming consisted exclusively of shareware titles on Apple Macintosh. But I can certainly get behind Bleszinski's follow-up remark that he'd like a potential Jazz Jackrabbit 3 to be a first-person game in the vein of PS1 classic Jumping Flash.\nRead more",

          "description": "Little-CRPG-that-could Baldur's Gate 3 has solved the Labyrinth, outwitted the Sphinx and ascended to the rank of Metacritic's highest-rated PC game of all time, knocking ZA/UM's Disco Elysium into second place. (OK, so technically they're both on 97, but I'm guessing the \"score distillation\" arithmetic behind-the-scenes puts Baldur's Gate 3 ahead - their positions were reversed last time I checked.) This follows a busy weekend for Larian's new game, which exceeded its own online player activity record on Sunday to the tune of around 875,000 players.\r\n\n\r\nIt's a terrific achievement for one of the richest and most rewarding D&D adaptations ever set to code. It's also only going to encourage those on the interwebs who are using Baldur's Gate 3's success as a stick to beat other developers with. As you've likely discovered for yourself, the new game is the centre of a raging discussion about what we should expect from today's \"triple-A games\", aka \"biggest/shiniest\". Some point to its lack of microtransactions or DRM, while others highlight its relative technical sturdiness and overall \"quality\". A few people go into specifics: I've read a couple of thoughtful comments comparing the bespoke, one-and-done nature of Baldur's Gate 3 quests with open world action titles and other genres that hinge on repeated quest formulas and reward systems.\r\n\n \nRead more",

In a pre-reveal showcase attended by RPS, producer Andreas Schmiedecker walked us through a few sections of this atypically green-fingered open world shooter.\nIn Outcast: ANB you play a growly-gruff ex-Navy SEAL, the sleekly named Cutter Slade, who roves a planet called Adelpha using a fancy jetpack. You're here to help the indigenous Talans - who definitely hail from the Ewoky end of the ethnic representation scale - fight off an army of robot invaders. The jetpack is the initial star attraction: it lets you boost, glide and dash through colourful landscapes inspired by 80s and 90s movies and comics. The associated animations seem a bit wooden to me: I often felt like I was watching somebody steer a man-shaped cursor, rather than a body in flight. But I certainly can't argue with the verticality and agility on display.\nRead more",

          "description": "THQ Nordic have announced Titan Quest 2, a sequel to Iron Lore Entertainment's action RPG of 2006, which was kind of a classical variation on Diablo with players touring Ancient Greece, Egypt and China in search of chthonic beasts to slay. The new game is the work of Grimlore Games, creator of Spellforce III and one of THQ Nordic's first internal development studios. It sees you hunting down Nemesis, goddess of retribution, who has gone a bit do-lally and is meddling with the Threads of Fate.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I admit, I was a little piqued by Homeworld 3's redesigned Mothership, which lies flat as a doormat - an act of blasphemy akin to flipping a crucifix upside down, or wearing a baseball cap backwards in your 50s.

          "description": "Overwatch 2 has launched on Steam and well, Activision Blizzard are probably regretting that right now. At the time of writing, the game has attracted 22,619 reviews, many written by people who've already been playing for a while on Battle.net, of which just 15% give the game a thumbs-up, making for an \"Overwhelmingly Negative\" rating. Tucked in amongst the usual troll reviews, cheeky links to Team Fortress 2 and dubious ASCII jokes there are some rather extensive essays on the game's direction and faults.\r\n\n\r\nMany players still have axes to grind about Overwatch 2's switch to a free-to-play battle pass model - check out our launch-day Overwatch 2 review for the nitty gritty - which introduced levelling for new characters and cosmetics to a game that once handed you its entire roster almost without caveats, and encouraged you to experiment freely. Others are angry about Overwatch 2's story-driven PVE modes, the supposed focus of the sequel - announced as a full-blown Hero Missions mode with skill trees and levelling, then dramatically stripped back to a series of separately sold seasonal co-op missions, much as with Halloween events in the first Overwatch. There are complaints about Blizzard's recent handling of the Overwatch League, and more subjective quibbles about the switch to a 5v5 team format and the precise ratio of DPS to Support heroes. A few reviews touch on Activision-Blizzard's alleged culture of sexual harassment and claims of unfair labour practices, which make Overwatch's emphasis on team spirit ring rather hollow.\r\n\n \nRead more",

As the name suggests, it's all about doing mildly game-breaking things with barrels, crates and other heavy containers, by taking advantage of high strength, the Throw command, and the fact that Larian RPG characters can somehow fit items as big as they are into their inventories, without bursting apart like rotten haggis.\nA straightforward tactic: consider lugging a few oil barrels into a throne room, and dropping them all around the resident big cheese before you confront him. Given reasonably careful distribution, it's possible to finish a whole battle this way in a single turn. Fortunately, while Baldur's Gate NPCs can be eagle-eyed when it comes to sneaking rogues, they're perfectly indifferent to people surrounding them with heavy explosives.\nRead more",

          "description": "I've been bolting together some ideas for a longer Starfield feature and while plying the sliplanes of Reddit, stumbled on this conversation about the game's handling of time. As many of you will know/be very weary of hearing, Starfield features hundreds of planets, together with moons and space stations, scattered around the galaxy in different solar systems. Real-life planets, of course, aren't fixed points: they rotate and orbit their stars at different speeds, depending on their mass and distance, which means that days, nights and seasons have different durations. \r\n\n\r\nStarfield appears to model this to some degree. Bethesda's Starfield Direct from June makes a fleeting distinction (thanks, JuiceHead33) between \"local time\", corresponding to where you land on a planet's surface, and \"UT\", which sounds like an abbreviation of \"universal time\", and presumably describes the passage of time throughout the wider galaxy. Both are displayed in 24 hour format. You can explore planet locations at different local times, as indicated by your fancy neo-Casio watch, with shifting lighting conditions that seem to correspond to the spinning of the planet around its sun. There's footage showing one particular area, The Hitching Post in Akila City, by day and night. The game also seems to model planetary alignments - there's the beginnings of a solar eclipse visible during one segment of the video.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Obviously, this means Stray Gods has some top-notch voice talent on board, but these casting choices also make another kind of sense. The premise of this 'roleplaying musical' is inspired by the Buffy the Vampire episode 'Once More With Feeling', you see, and as in that piece of classic TV, part of the appeal is seeing (or hearing) performers who famously earn a crust in more action-oriented roles forced to prove their singing chops instead.\nThankfully, The Last Of Us crew all have a finely tuned set of pipes on them, not least Bailey, and the notes they belt out absolutely do this game’s charming and entertaining concept justice. Even better, they’re ably backed by the admirable composing skills of Austin Wintory, a fizzy script and pitch-perfect character design.\nRead more",

I'd played this bit before in early access, so I knew to fireball the tiny bit of rope to drop the big stone down into the floor and take out the rest of the bandits hanging about up there pretty sharpish. But before I went down beneath the chapel (there were a lot of other nasty bandits down there last time I checked), I had a little extra nose around the outside, eventually discovering a locked hatch down a nearby cliff path that took me to the brilliantly named Dank Crypt.\nSensing not all was well down here, I went into hiding mode and gingerly crept around the place, looting the handful of corpses lying about of their gold and spell scrolls, but leaving their weapons. You see, I have a terrible habit in RPGs of stuffing my pockets with absolutely everything I can find. In Bioshock, I will scavenge everything out of every bin like some feral raccoon; in Skyrim, I had to enable a cheat code for infinite storage one time because I was so overencumbered (and couldn't bear to part with everything I'd picked up over the course of the quest) that I actually couldn't move. And in my early hours of Baldur's Gate 3, I started doing exactly the same thing, looting everyone's swords, daggers and crossbows up on the Nautiloid. Not to much effect, mind. Nothing was really that much better than what I already had. So I resolved to do better and resist temptation. And what a dumb idea that turned out to be... \nRead more",

Well, some of us like to think of ourselves as serious journalists, thank you very much, so I'd like to call your attention to the, dare I say, more grown-up elements of the patch, which range from fine-tuning the tooltips to making dragons appear in the right place.\r\n\n\r\nTear your eyes from those lurid details of absentee knickers and glitchy sausages, and you'll see that Larian has fixed no less than 13 crash bugs and progress blockers, though sadly not the crash bug I always seem to get when I run the game in DirectX 11. They've also sorted out an issue with enemies entering combat when they're on a different floor, together with the occasional odd prolonged silence in over 200 dialogues, and a smattering of minor issues with cameras and clipping.

And I think in the end - not 'I think', I know, in the end, it was the wrong decision to keep on pushing on it. Now [the reason I did it] was when we still independent and we were selling it, it was a more interesting game to publishers. And when you're asking for $50, $60, $70, $80 million, you have to have something interesting to talk about. And multiplayer made it interesting.

The original Xbox 360/PS3 game launched with a tidal wave of bugs, some of them game-ending. One particular collection of technical gremlins trapped me on a farm during the prologue. Having sat through some cutscenes, I found myself at the centre of a strange spacetime distortion redolent of the other world in Neil Gaiman's Coraline. If I tried to leave the farm the simulation slowly broke down, with movement consisting of weird fragmentary teleports. \nI saw a distant rider stop-starting through a canyon with his own hat darting through the air behind him. I followed the man for as long as I could, before tumbling through the terrain into uncreated space. Proper Lynchian stuff. Red Dead Redemption 2 had its share of bugs and glitches, but none of them quite as captivating as this. Still, it would have been nice to see the world beyond the farm, and that was my first thought when Take-Two Interactive and Rockstar announced a new Red Dead Redemption port, for release on 17th August. Sadly, however, the port appears to be PS4 and Switch-only for the moment, though a PC release might happen if the stars align.\nRead more",

There's only so many times you can do that dance of shieldwalls before it loses its charm. Still, it sounds like the new Tzeentch Lord might wash away my Total Warennui, in being one of those playstyles that is more about tricking and invading rivals than taking territory.\nRead more",

I've just discovered the finer applications of Mage Hands, which are a great antidote to goblin archers - simply spawn one behind the offender, use it to hurl them from the cliff they're standing on, and chuck a nearby crate after them for good measure. Magical indeed! Or so I thought, before I read about the real spells that lurk at the top of the level-up ladder in the D&D player handbook. \nThese feats of wizardry make Mage Handing seem about as otherworldly as setting an alarm clock. Take Wish, a ninth level conjuration that allows you to \"alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires\", up to and including generating pricey equipment from nothing and rewinding time. Or how about Prismatic Wall, which spawns an ephemeral barrier 90-feet long, made up of seven layers that inflict a different effect on any creature passing through, from poison to petrification? Spicy enough for you, goblin archers? Sadly, it doesn't sound like either of these spells is hidden away anywhere in Baldur's Gate 3, which caps progression at level 12. And it's far from certain that they'll be added in the shape of an expansion pack. There's a good reason for this: higher level D&D spells and abilities are so potent it's hard to include them without turning Baldur's Gate 3 characters into gods.\nRead more",

And also every single one of those misfit heroes wants to get at you. In many cases with zero prompting from you whatsoever. It doesn't end with your team companions either; by my loose estimations, any character who is in upwards of three cutscenes comes with a 70% chance of propositioning you. There's one romance option that I experienced effectively as a jump scare, entering a cutscene to see a character suddenly and casually-not-casually shirtless. It never ends. In hindsight, picking from a selection of genitals in character creation was probably a clue.\nRead more",

Assuming you can still access the game at all.\n\"I don't like the word 'retro game',\" Kamiya told VGC in a wide-ranging interview also notable for some chunky insights on onomatopoeia in Japanese manga and its US adaptations. \"I'm obviously not a native English speaker so it might be something I'm interpreting from a Japanese perspective, but hearing the word 'retro' from a Japanese viewpoint, suggests more of a 'fad' brought back from a past era and reskinned for the current era.\"\nRead more",

But for the citizens of Videoverse, an online community that's part and parcel of the soon to be defunct 1-bit video games console the Kinmoku Shark, this sense of an ending is something that many of them aren't equipped to deal with, least of all teenager Emmett, who's just discovered the fan page for his favourite video game, Feudal Fantasy. \nAs he deals with the prospect of having to bid farewell to friends old and new, including the mysterious but talented fan artist Vivi, Videoverse taps into a potent and nostalgic melancholy. It's a love letter to the early internet at its rose-tinted best, and to the lost, formative spaces that brought so many like-minded individuals together and gave them a sense of purpose. Yes, there are trolls spoiling everyone's fun, and yes, there's a hint of something more nefarious going on underneath Videoverse's source code. But another Hypnospace Outlaw this is not. Rather, this is a proto-internet tale that's all about the friendships we form online, and the bonds that carry us forward when real-life relationships just don't cut it anymore.\nRead more",

I quit playing Frank And Drake twice before even meeting its second protagonist, but something about it kept pulling me back.\r\n\nIt's partly the style. Some gorgeous rotoscoping gives its few characters a sense of constant motion that's unreal and very lifelike at once, and it's sometimes pushed further by having them decelerate to a blurred freeze frame when you stop walking. The backgrounds are static but interactable things shimmer a bit, like in old cartoons where you could always tell what was background and what was going to do something. More than that, though, it had me intrigued.\nRead more",

Case in point, our Ed breezily announced yesterday in our team Slack that he was playing as a Dark Urge bard called, wait for it, Edders Sheeran like it was no big deal whatsoever. I'm not gonna lie, a tiny part of me died inside upon hearing this, simply because of its sheer (not a pun), unadultered brilliance. I mean, come on, it's so good it should actually be illegal. \nBut it also confirmed to me a deep dark truth about myself that I think I knew deep down, but had kinda been pushing under my equally drab mental carpet for years and years. I'm quite boring at the end of the day, and am the type of person who, no matter the game, always creates basically the same identical person every single time. \nRead more",

I don't like squinting at brow density or sliding the juiciness of my lips down a scale, twisting and turning my character as if it really and truly matters when I drown them in chainmail anyway. But getting my fella right for Baldur's Gate 3 was of utmost importance, as they'd be my 100+ hour vessel for awful, awful decisions. And I've started off strong, having created an awful little guy.\nLet me introduce you to Edders Sheeran, the bard. On the surface he seems like a cheerful sprite, ready to pat his little drum and have everyone do a nice little dance. Truthfully, he is a psychopath who suppresses the urge to kill, thanks to a malevolent background choice that most would leave for a second playthrough, so as he plays Shape Of You, he also imagines the Shape Of You Dead.\nRead more",

This is not something the game discourages. In fact, I would say that Larian's Dungeons-&-Dragons-but-digital game actively encourages it. Both Edders and Graham found out that you can die almost immediately upon finishing the tutorial and encountering a dying bit of ocotopus sashimi in a crashed ship; fail a roll involved in talking to this unfortunate mind flayer and that's it. Kaput, in about an hour. As Graham observed, the lesson that this teaches you is not \"mind flayers are dangerous\", because you have already learned this lesson on account of the opening cutscene being all about that. The lesson is \"the DM is a prick, so savescum often\". \nRead more",

Already, there are imitators popping up trying to duplicate the game’s special sauce. As with many games that have spurred a sudden explosion of similar titles, it tantalizes developers with its simple but malleable gameplay.\nI did play the PC version a few months back and was lucky enough to eventually claw my way from its grips.

Not only is the game a hit commercially and critically, but the development team is also addressing multiple pain points due to player feedback, which you always love to see. A patch was just released on PS5, and like most of the patches before it (on any platform), there's a lot to unpack. Here are the big takeaways.\nCrashes and trophies are fixed\nTrophy/Achievement bugs are some of the most annoying glitches out there, especially if they only impact one or two seemingly small tasks.

          "description": "Forklift Interactive has launched Stage Games Inc’s production strategy game, Desynced, into Steam Early Access today.\nDesynced is part automation game, part base-builder, and part RTS. You find yourself stranded on an unknown world and need to manufacture parts to repair your ship. You take command of a horde of drones that you use to extract resources and take them to various facilities to be processed. It bills itself as an “automation game without belts.” There’s a detailed system for programming your drones to work more autonomously, and you can also bring in other players for multiplayer.\nhttps://youtu.be/SLVZlg7sp9E\nMeanwhile, there is also an RTS aspect to Desynced, where you have to protect your factory. That seems like a worthwhile wrinkle to me since being able to diagnose and repair damage to your automated systems sounds pretty fantastic.\nWhile the automated production genre has been seeing a lot of growth in the indie sphere over the last few years, I haven’t taken the dive yet. I’m not entirely sure why. For one thing, it’s a genre that can only really flourish outside of mainstream gaming, which is something I love. I also enjoy management games. I think I’m afraid of getting sucked in and finding myself having difficulty uncoupling when it comes time to play a game for work. That’s a pretty good problem to have.\nDesynced is available for PC through Steam Early Access starting today. Stage Games is estimating that it will stay in Early Access for a year before reaching completion.\nThe post Production strategy game Desynced launches on Early Access today appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "HoYoverse announced via social media channels that two new characters will be coming to Genshin Impact: Wriothesley and Neuvillette.\nWhat do we know about Wriothesley and Neuvillette?\nWriothesley (apparently pronounced “rizz-ly” or “rise-ly”) has a Cryo Vision and is the Lord of the Fortress of Meropide, which is some sort of prison at the bottom of the sea. He is Ousia-aligned; although his previous character art showed him with a Pneuma Vision shape, this was swiftly corrected. Aside from this, we know nothing about his weapon or kit, and will have to wait for further announcements to see how he plays.\nNeuvillette is much more mysterious, with some of his information censored with triple question marks. We do know that he is the Chief Justice of Fontaine and some kind of father figure to the Melusines. He is likely very important to the main story in Genshin Impact, which would give a reason for all the secrecy. Neuvillette uses Hydro, but not through a Vision. What exactly he is and how he uses his powers are a great mystery, possibly with answers in upcoming Archon Quests.\n[caption id=\"attachment_396793\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"] Image via HoYoverse[/caption]\nWhen are Wriothesley and Neuvillette coming to Genshin Impact?\nDrip marketing like this usually comes in two versions before the characters are released. This means we can expect Wriothesley and Neuvillette sometime in Version 4.1 of Genshin Impact. Whether they will be in the first half or second remains to be seen, along with who will accompany their banners. \nIf you are interested in either of these characters, you may want to start saving Primogems now.\nThe post New characters Wriothesley and Neuvillette announced for Genshin Impact appeared first on Destructoid.",

He was – let's not mince words here – a monstrously irritating NPC, and now someone taken that monstrosity and actualized it in physical form.\nOver on Nexus Mods, user theocddragon simply asks \"good heavens what have I done\" with a modification for Oblivion that turns everyone's favorite Wood Elf to hate into an unholy sight. Seriously, it's like if the Adoring Fan was rejected from Tim Burton's Beetlejuice for being too odd.\n[caption id=\"attachment_396762\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"] Image via theocddragon/Nexus Mods.[/caption]\nEditing the character model, the modder has reconstructing the NPC's face using a dragging tool that has resulted in the severely morphed image of this once annoying–though wholly innocent–citizen of Cyrodiil.\nKill it with three fires\nDescribing it as an \"eldritch abomination with one singular eye,\" theocddragon has unleashed a nightmare unto the Oblivion community and those who witness it. They even question why someone would be able to wield such power in editing software.\nIt kind of reminds me of the pre-menu screen in Super Mario 64, in which – perhaps in a bid to show the power of the N64 console – you could stretch and morph Mario's face. It, too, produced some horrifying images that are not of this world.\nThat aside, it does show just how beloved Oblivion in the community, even after 17 years. The Bethesda RPG has definitely aged as time has gone by, but that's where Skyblivion comes into the picture.\nThis is a fan-made project that will be a complete remake of TES4 done in Skyrim's engine. As such, we'll get a much prettier (though perhaps not visually up-to-date) version of Oblivion. Let's just hope the Adoring Fan will not be the facial atrocity he is in theocddrago's mod.\nThe post This Oblivion mod turns the Adoring Fan into an unholy monstrosity appeared first on Destructoid.",

It was a Gauntlet-style dungeon crawler with distinct character classes, lite RPG elements, and neat mod support.

          "description": "Many of us horror fans are giddy about the fact that Silent Hill is making a comeback. However, the loss of P.T. (the SH project that was being developed by Hideo Kojima and Pan's Labyrinth director Guillermo del Toro) will always be a sore point. Not just for fans, either, as even those involved still feel the pain.\nRecently, people on Twitter have acknowledged the nine years that have elapsed since P.T. was released. Many have been reminiscing about what could have been before the game was canceled in 2015. One such person is del Toro himself, who reached out to Konami, seemingly in a bid to see if the studio is interested in reviving the dead project.\nhttps://twitter.com/RealGDT/status/1690528967802167296\nThere's not much that's been said by the director other than asking Konami, \"What sayeth thou?\" This was followed by the phrase \"Irrumabo Konamitus\" which, when translated from Latin to English, says \"I will visit Konami.\"\nDon't let your P.T.s be dreams\nIt sounds like del Toro is very much interested in reviving P.T. \nGiven that Silent Hill is making a triumphant return, hopes will remain that Kojima's take on the series will one day count itself among the many other upcoming SH games. It's hard to say. Konami pretty much turned its back on the franchise (and on Hideo Kojima) several years ago. Whether the studio will ever return to this one particular project cannot be said.\nIt's also hard to imagine it's been nearly ten years since P.T. dropped on PS4 with nary a word. Its photorealistic visuals, Kojima-esque puzzles, and terrifying atmosphere made it stand out. The fact that it was eventually revealed to be a teaser for the now-defunct Silent Hills was even more thrilling.\nSuch a shame it never came to be. Perhaps del Toro's words will open up a new dialogue of possibilities. Ah, to dream.\nThe post Guillermo del Toro reaches out to Konami on P.T.’s ninth anniversary appeared first on Destructoid.",

Before then, we're still being drip-fed bite-sized bits of information, including the story prior to the game itself.\nOver on the developer's website, you can scroll down to a timeline of the major political events that take place before we join things. It begins in the year 2050, when humans take their first steps on Mars.\nJust 50 years later, we begin living in space. Then, after just a few more years, we reach Alpha Centauri, the nearest star system to Earth (about 4.3 light years away from us).\nhttps://twitter.com/StarfieldGame/status/1691105607712202752\nAfter that, the timeline gives a brief rundown of the main events that occur before Starfield kicks off. For example, there's a little bit of information about the United Colonies, the settling of some of the major cities, some wars. All that good stuff.\nWe've truly left Earth behind\nThe timeline ends when Starfield begins. At this point, we can't really say what will happen in the story. All we can safely say is that we'll likely be playing a big part in it. It's also quite optimistic of Bethesda to say that humanity will be able to step on our nearest planet in less than 30 years. I mean, it is possible, but who knows what the future of real-life space travel will be?\nThat's why we have science fiction.

          "description": "Another Japan-exclusive Famicom game has received new life thanks to fans. 1990’s Dai Kaiju Deburas has received a fan translation patch, turning it into the Anglophonic Giant Monster Flaburas.\nVideo games have a history of not treating kaiju very well. That’s partially because Japan kept most of the good ones and left us with games like Godzilla for NES or Godzilla for PS4. Dai Kaiju Deburas is a unique take on the genre by focusing more on strategy. You don’t play as the monster itself. Instead, you’re the military, and you’re trying to defend an egg while it’s transported across Japan.\nIt’s kind of like 1991’s Godzilla 2: War of the Monsters for NES. However, Dai Kaiju Deburas is less of a chore to play.\nI actually own this game for Famicom, so I’m happy to see it finally get a translation. There’s a decent amount of text that makes it hard to play if you don’t speak English. My Japanese reading skill got me through a few missions, but I wound up putting it aside and never getting back to it. I had planned on playing it for my old Famicom Friday column, but it kind of fell by the wayside. I’ve even got a picture of it on my Mickey TV. Here you go:\n[caption id=\"attachment_396649\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image by Destructoid[/caption]\nWhether you love kaiju, are looking for something new, or just like a decent turn-based strategy game, Dai Kaiju Deburas is worth a look. You can find the patch for it right over here.\nThe post Dai Kaiju Deburas for Famicom gets fan translated as Giant Monster Flaburas appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "I bought my Sega Saturn back when I was in college. Before that, I didn’t know a single person who had ever owned one. It had only been off the market for a decade, but games for it were tough to come by; still are. It sold nearly 10 million units. I have no hard numbers on this, but anecdotally, it seems to have barely made a ripple in Canada. Even knowing that the platform was mostly just popular in Japan, I would think I’d remember a section for Saturn games in Zellers.\nOf the games I was able to sweep up in those early days, I mostly played Virtual On. However, a more absurd game got the second-most slice of my attention, and that was Street Fighter: The Movie. Or, as my roommates called it, Street Fighter: The Movie: The Game.

Before the 2021 Quake remaster by Nightdive Studios, I was actually most familiar with Quake 4, and I really don’t remember that much about it. In 1996, I was into Duke Nukem 3D. And then after that, it was Goldeneye 007. I at least played Quake 2… The N64 version.\nBut after the first Quake was remastered and introduced me to the series, I held off on any more series exploration, anticipating the second one would eventually get the same treatment. My patience paid off, and the Quake II remaster has arrived. Once again, it’s a terrific introduction.\n[caption id=\"attachment_396573\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]\nQuake 2 (PC [Reviewed], PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Switch)\nNightDive Studios,…",

          "description": "Katsuhiro Harada, the director of Tekken 8 and long-time veteran of the series, has responded to what he refers to as \"silly threats.\" In a recent tweet, he hits back at online trolls with a pretty lengthy statement about what harassment leads to.\nIn a recent post on Twitter, Harada decided to give his take on the threats that have been coming his way online. One such example comes from a no-named user who says they will hit the director \"with a Burning Hammer\" (a move used by Tekken wrestler King) if Tekken 8 doesn't feature Eddy Gordo.\nhttps://twitter.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1689456340564111361\nHarada makes it clear that, serious or not, such threats affect he and \"everyone at FGC\" (fighting game community). In a three-point post, he outlines what comments like these leads to. Number one being that security is bumped up, which \"increases operating costs and increases the burden on the players\" who attend.\nMotivation also decreases\nHe goes on to say that \"company founders, board members, and lawyers 'Don't like to be intimidated',\" and that he does not \"adopt the views of those who use 'We' when expressing their opinions,\" as though such people represent all fans.\nThe end result is that studios simply have no motivation to carry on making games when threats are being made. Tekken 8 is highly anticipated, and the last thing fans want or need is for the team to not want to keep working on it.\nYet still people persist. Immediately below Harada's tweet, one user says they will be spending their money elsewhere because companies like Bandai Namco easily forget the \"narrow demographic who, mostly, go out of their way to afford\" a \"luxury product.\" Harada's response to this is a bit more... direct. So, as he's said before, don't ask him for shit.\nThe post Tekken 8 director fires back at ‘silly threats’ over the roster appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Ubisoft has announced that the upcoming Assassin's Creed Mirage has gone gold. Even more surprisingly, the game's release date has shifted up a week, from October 12 to October 5. No explanation was given for the changed release date, though it's unlikely fans are complaining.\nhttps://twitter.com/assassinscreed/status/1691117533846482944\nAssassin's Creed Mirage is supposed to be a smaller, more streamlined Assassin's Creed. Promotional material for the upcoming game, which is centred on Valhalla's Basim, reveals that it returns to the franchise's roots by placing greater focus on parkour and stealth gameplay.\n[caption id=\"attachment_396580\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Ubisoft.[/caption]\nAssassin's Creed Mirage coming sooner than expected\nThe \"gone gold\" announcement simply means that a release version of the game is complete and ready for duplication and shipping. Rather than sit on the game, Ubisoft has decided to release the game earlier. While this does suggest some confidence in the game, it doesn't necessarily mean it won't be getting any post-launch patches.\nOne of the benefits of the new release date is that Mirage gets to launch relatively early in a month which is absolutely stacked with headlining releases. Ubisoft has avoided releasing Mirage on the same week as Forza Motorsport and Lords of the Fallen, though it now shares a release week with Detective Pikachu Returns. Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and Alan Wake 2 are both highly anticipated sequels also scheduled to release in October.\nIn many ways, it feels like Assassin's Creed Mirage is a response to some of the complaints lodged against Valhalla. If it can avoid the open-world bloat that plagued Valhalla while providing a compelling narrative for Basim, Mirage could be the breath of fresh air the franchise needs.\nThe post Assassin’s Creed Mirage is launching a week earlier appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, it appears as though the long-awaited FPS horror game from GSC could be launched at the start of December, even though there's been no official confirmation.\nThat's according to the game's listing on German retail website PLAION, as spotted by ex-VGC writer Andrew Marmo. As of this story going live, it looks as though STALKER 2 may be releasing on December 1. That goes for all platforms, it seems.\nhttps://twitter.com/the_marmolade/status/1690092961772482560\nOf course, the developer hasn't said anything about this, so it's hard to say whether this is accurate information or not. Amazon currently has the game's release date as December 31, which is likely just a placeholder.\nThis sounds a bit familiar\nMaybe some of you are scratching your heads and thinking, \"Wait. Didn't we already get a confirmed launch window?\" Why, yes. Back in January 2022, GSC Game World did post on Twitter to say that STALKER 2 was coming December 8, 2022. Though that was last year, and as you can see, that didn't happen, either.\nAs such, it seems as though the release date is probably going to be December, but temper expectations until we get official word.\nIt's a shame the studio had to push back the upcoming sequel. Much of the delay came from the Russian invasion into Ukraine that begin at the start of 2022, which forced the developer to relocate to Prague.\nAs such, delaying the release of STALKER 2 was expected but understandable, and most fans are happy to wait a little longer. Hopefully, GSC will make an announcement soon around this possible December 1 release date.\nThe post STALKER 2’s release date may have been leaked appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "During the August 8 Pokemon Presents events, there were a few noteworthy announcements and reveals. A new Pokemon animated series called Path to the Peak received some of the spotlight, and the first episode was released on August 11.\nThe series tells the tale of a girl named Ava who finds it difficult to fit in after moving to a new town. Although she gets off to a rocky start, she is quickly able to make friends through the shared hobby of playing Pokemon TCG. Although Path to the Peak isn't a must-watch kind of series, it is a great treat for fans.\n[caption id=\"attachment_396512\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via The Pokemon Company.[/caption]\nAva and the Pokemon TCG Club\nThe social aspects of Pokemon are one of the reasons the franchise found monumental success. By allowing and encouraging players to trade creatures and compete, a vibrant global community has formed. This element of the franchise is reflected in Path to the Peak, though it is focused on card collecting.\nLike most kids who find themselves in a new town, Ava struggles to fit in. In the first episode, we discover how she finds a strange Pikachu origami that leads her to a Pokemon TCG club. At first, she is quickly trounced, but after learning a few tips from her dead, she is able to come out victorious and become a member of the Pokemon club. It seems her greatest battle is still to come because the episode ends with her catching the attention of Celestine, the best player in the school.\nThe cartoon comes at just the right time, as it has been quite an eventful year for Pokemon TCG. This year, the Scarlet and Violet generation of Pokemon TCG kicked off, and the Obsidian Flames set was released on August 11. Fans can also look forward to the Pokemon 151 set that will celebrate the original Kanto creatures.\nThe post Pokémon: Path to the Peak (the TCG cartoon) Episode 1 is out appeared first on Destructoid.",

That's if you're lucky enough to be able to get any of it, of course.\nA recent video on the AMD YouTbe channel introduces a limited edition graphics card and processor themed after the upcoming space-faring RPG. More specifically, it's the Radeon 7900 XTX GPU and the Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPU that have been given the special Starfield makeover.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1KjsqaWIU4\nHowever, there are only 500 of these being made available. You can check out a few more details on AMD's website. To make things even trickier, it appears as though only those who were in attendance at QuakeCon 2023 will be in with a chance of getting hold of the hardware. It doesn't look like they'll be going on sale.\nSo what's the point?\nThis seems like one more way that AMD and Bethesda are cozying up together. A few weeks back, the tech giant announced that it would be giving away a free copy of Starfield with purchases of select graphics cards or CPUs.\nThe game is also being optimized for Team Red's products, due to a partnership between Bethesda and AMD. As such, some Nvidia or Intel users might be feeling a little bit left out.\nWith just a few weeks to go now until release day, Starfield retains its first-class seat on the Hype Train. There's a lot riding on this new IP from the Skyrim and Fallout studio. We can't say for certain how successful the game will be when it comes out. Ah, who are we kidding?

This game comes in hot with new animation, cutscenes, and voice acting. Adventuring has never been quite so… Dangeresque.\nExtravagant summary aside, I’ve been a Homestar Runner fan since high school. Which, yes, was a very, very long time ago. The flash webtoon was one of the earliest influences on my writing style, and a lot of that is still with me. Unfortunately, editors don’t often like it when I deliberately mangle sentences or haphazardly mash words together to form clumsy new ones, so I have to pull my punches.\nFrom what I remember of the original Roomisode, it came out as sort of a teaser to the then-upcoming Strong Bad’s Cool Game For Attractive People. With this and the recent de-listing of SBCGFAP from digital storefronts, I’m really hoping I wake up one day to news of a Cool Game remaster. But for now, I have the Dangeresque: The Roomisode Triungulate to keep me warm at night.\nLooks like you’re gonna have to jump to Steam or Itch.io to pick up a PC version of Dangeresque: The Roomisode Triungulate.\nThe post Dangeresque: The Roomisode Triungulate has jumped to release appeared first on Destructoid.",

Naturally, it was assumed that it would be the next installment in the popular South Park RPG series. However, it appears that won't be the case.\nDuring the 2023 THQ Nordic Digital Showcase, South Park: Snow Day was officially revealed. Players will battle through the snow-piled streets of South Park with up to three friends. Apparently, the highlight feature is that South Park will be in 3D, though I'm not sure that's a good thing.\nWe also got a reveal trailer:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEv35KH-DXQ\nI think I'd rather have another 2D RPG\nEven though South Park: The Stick of Truth and South Park: Fractured but Whole weren't for everyone, I could definitely appreciate what they were going for. A comical adventure in the world of South Park intended for fans of the show. Also, there's something to the 2D charm and honestly, it looks kinda goofy in 3D.\nIn fact, the trailer reminded me a lot of the South Park game on N64. Obviously with more modern visuals, but the same sort of goofy 3D graphics and gameplay.\nNo details on the actual game were provided other than it will be 3D and feature co-op multiplayer. It kind of looks similar to Fat Princess to me, but it's hard to really tell until we know more.\nSouth Park: Snow Day will release in 2024 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post South Park: Snow Day is a new co-op multiplayer game that looks very mediocre appeared first on Destructoid.",

And through that passion, it was hard not to become a fan yourself.\nIt makes the trajectory of modern Konami feel like that much more of a betrayal. They’re sitting on the games they made us fans of. Or worse.

The charges state Glukhovsky posted texts and videos on his social channels claiming that Russian servicemen have been committing crimes in Ukraine.\nAs reported by the Associated Press, Glukhovskey was tried in absentia as he is not in Russia. A famed journalist and author, Glukhovsky was pronounced a \"foreign agent\" last year due to his critique of the Kremlin and Putin himself. This case falls under the law passed by Russian parliament shortly after the invasion of Ukraine, imposing jail terms of up to 15 years for spreading \"fake\" news about the military.\nDmitry Glukhovsky has been a vocal critic of the Russian regime for some time, and he hasn't been hiding it at all. The author has talked openly and critically on social channels about the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which started in February 2022.\nWithin games, Glukhovsky is well-known as the author behind the Metro series that spawned the video game adaptation. These dystopian novels follow survivors living in the metro of Russia, as rival factions vie for power beneath a post-nuclear wasteland.\nEven within the gaming world, Glukhovsky is hardly alone in his critique of Russia's behavior. Metro 2033 developer 4A Games called for support among many others, helping shine as bright of a limelight on the situation as possible for the industry.\nSome of the developers have, of course, had first-had experience with the war.

However, that wait has been shortened just a little; today, Ubisoft revealed that the game has gone gold, and since they're done ahead of schedule, it will now come out on October 5th, a week earlier than previously announced.\nAssassin's Creed Mirage has gone gold and is coming out a week early! 📀\n#AssassinsCreed pic.twitter.com/eWAZttvjIX\nAugust 14, 2023\nThe game follows Basim Ibn Ishaq, an Assassin previously introduced as a supporting character in 2020's Assassin's Creed Valhalla. While the series was traditionally about stealth-focused combat in dense cities, more recent entries have put the player into more open-world environments and incorporated RPG mechanics. Mirage is a return to that classic formula of old, complete with the iconic white hood, hidden blade, and parkour. Set in Baghdad, the game takes place 12 years before the events in Valhalla.\nIn an era where it feels like games are constantly being delayed, it's a nice change of pace when a game is moved up instead. Recently, Baldur's Gate 3 moved its PC release up to avoid competing with \"other RPGs,\" which most likely refers to Starfield. Mirage's new date doesn't seem to be motivated by the desire to avoid competition, but it does pull it a little ahead of the other huge games releasing in October, specifically Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which both come out on October 20.\nHow do you feel about developers advancing their release dates? Let us know in the comments!",

Four players can join together in this co-op title on a quest to save the world during a day without school. You can see the teaser trailer for this game below.\n\n\nWe don't have many more details surrounding the title, but the game is in development by Question Games, a  studio based in California and Virginia.

          "description": "Earlier this year, Paramount teased that a video game based on the popular Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles graphic novel, The Last Ronin, was in development. While we haven't heard much since then, today's THQ Nordic Digital Showcase gave us a teaser trailer. Unfortunately, we did not get any looks at gameplay or additional information.\nIn the Last Ronin graphic novel storyline, the final surviving member of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is on a quest for revenge in a ruined New York City. Both the trailer and the new synopsis point toward this being the case for the game as well. \"Who is the Last Ronin? In a future, battle-ravaged New York City, a lone surviving Turtle embarks on a seemingly hopeless mission seeking justice for the family he lost. From the minds of the creators of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and based on the best-selling comic book event by Eastman, Waltz, Bishop, Delgado, and the Escorza Brothers: the official video game adaptation of TMNT: The Last Ronin.\"\n\n\nAccording to senior vice president for games and emerging media at Paramount Global in his interview with Polygon back in March, TMNT: The Last Ronin will be a single-player action RPG similar to the modern God of War series. The title will feature a mature tone, which should be exciting for fans of the comic series, but Rosen made it clear back in March that the game was years away from release.\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin doesn't currently have a release window, but is currently slated to come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

The game was first announced in February 2021. \nEver Crisis hits iOS and Android on September 7. The game is a free-to-play single-player chapter-structured RPG that spans the entire FFVII timeline. Expect to relieve key elements of the original 1997 game plus new story elements written by FF VII Remake story and scenario writer Kazushige Nojima that center on a young Sephiroth. Gameplay includes active-time battles, and monetization takes the form of microtransactions for certain weapons and equipment. See it in action in the latest trailer from Summer Game Fest in June.\n\n\nThis will be the latest stab at bringing FFVII content to mobile. In January, Square Enix shut down Final Fantasy VII The First Soldier, its mobile battle royale that was revealed alongside Ever Crisis two years ago. Hopefully, Ever Crisis has a better run and offers a solid appetizer until Final Fantasy VII Rebirth launches next year.",

In Destiny 2, Reddick played Commander Zavala – an important recurring character in Destiny lore. Reddick was also an outspoken fan of the game that engaged with the community often, so recasting his role was always going to be a difficult task.\nToday, Bungie announced that legendary actor Keith David would be taking over the role. David is an accomplished film and television actor appearing in movies like The Thing and TV shows like Community (pictured below).\nHe has also voiced a number of characters in animated films and video games. He played Dr. Facilier in The Princess and the Frog and he played Keith David in Saint's Row IV. Perhaps his most famous video game role, however, is that of The Arbiter in Halo games. David is no stranger to working with Bungie.\nIn the post on Bungie's site announcing the casting, David said, \"I am honored to continue the great work of Lance Reddick as Zavala. Lance captured the character's sense of integrity so wonderfully. It is my intention to continue that work.\"",

However, none of those updates were as substantial as the one we got on the upcoming Scarlet and Violet DLC, with the showcase spending ten minutes of its 35-minute runtime to reveal new Pokémon, new areas, and even a release date. Here's everything you need to know about Pokémon Scarlet and Vilet: The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero.\n\n\nWe knew that one of the expansions, The Teal Mask, would be coming in the fall – but now we know the exact date. On September 13, you'll be able to leave the Paldea region and explore the area around Kitakami Village, which is where the DLC takes place. Accor…",

          "description": "If you were looking forward to playing the pro-wrestling-themed RPG WrestleQuest today for its launch, it looks like that card was subject to change. The game has suffered a last-minute delay and will now arrive on August 22.\nDeveloper Mega Cat Studios and publisher Skybound Games announced the delay yesterday evening, explaining the cause was due to the discovery of a save glitch. The statement reads,\n“When performing final checks on one of our launch platforms, we discovered it was possible for players to lose their save game progress when playing WrestleQuest on multiple different devices. Because this is a game filled with hours of content and player progress is so important, we could never bodyslam our fans like that.”\nWhile it’s a bummer to see the game get pushed back mere hours before launch, it’s a good thing the team caught this issue before it could affect players. Curious wrestling and RPG fans will have to wait another couple of weeks, but at least they'll presumably be able to play with some peace of mind. \nWrestleQuest unfolds in a world molded after action figure wrestling leagues with protagonist Randy “Muchacho Man” Santos on a quest to become the ultimate superstar. Inspired by classics like Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VI, you’ll partner with a large cast of fellow grapplers to unleash special attacks and tag team moves on your opponents. In addition to fictional personalities, several real-life stars appear in the game, including Jeff Jarrett, Jake “The Snake” Roberts, Sgt. Slaughter, among others.\nWresleQuest will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, PC, and on mobile via Netflix.",

Best of all, you can add one of the most coveted Pokémon from Gen I, Mew, to your party for free right now. Then, you can gear up to challenge the powerful Mewtwo during the aptly named Get Mew And Mewtwo event.\nBeginning now, you can receive Mew as a Mystery Gift in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. To do this, simply go to the Mystery Gift in-game menu while connected to the internet and enter the password \"GETYOURMEW\" before September 18. Each Mew's Tera Type, nature, and moves will be different to reflect the Mythical Pokémon's flexible capabilities. You'll be able to add Mew to your party and continue your adventures around the Paldea region, but you can also participate in the second portion of this event.\nThe second phase of this event kicks off September 1, with Mewtwo appearing in special Tera Raid battles. If you're able to defeat Mewtwo in these Tera Raid battles, you'll be rewarded with the opportunity to catch a Mewtwo with the Mightiest Mark, meaning these will be seven-star Tera Raid battles. The Pokémon Company also teases that if you challenge Mewtwo with Mew, you can expect \"something special.\"\nPokémon Scarlet and Violet will also play host to several other Tera Raid battle events during this time. Wave 1 runs from today until August 17, Wave 2 runs from August 18 until August 31, and then Mewtwo finally arrives from September 1 to September 17.\n\n\nDuring the same Pokémon Presents livestream, we also learned a lot about the upcoming Pokémon Scarlet and Violet expansions. For more on Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, be sure to check out our review. If you're more about the nostalgic side of the Pokémon franchise, this Pokémon Presents had you covered there as well, as Nintendo Switch Online also added two '90s Pokémon spin-offs to its classic game catalog.",

Activision confirmed today’s reveal last week after the game leaked online.\nThe teaser doesn’t provide much to go on except the release date; platforms are unannounced, but we imagine it'll be on the usual suspects. Sledgehammer Games is taking the reins, making it the first Modern Warfare title not made by Infinity Ward (but it's still assisting, as all Call of Duty studios tend to). Sledgehammer's last entry was 2021’s Call of Duty: Vanguard, and it also developed WWII and Advanced Warfare. \n\n\nIn the meantime, be sure to check out our Modern Warfare II review and read how that game and Warzone will continue to get content updates in the form of new celebrity operators such as Snoop Dogg and Nicki Minaj.

Framed through a humorous parody of a Nintendo Direct, Devolver released a \"Devolver Delayed Showcase\" to tell players all about the games they won't be playing in 2023. The showcase highlights five games in particular: The Plucky Squire, Skate Story, Anger Foot, Stick it to the Stickman, and Pepper Grinder.\n\"We have some exciting news about next year,\" one host says. \"This year's delays,\" the other host follows up. \"Some of our brightest upcoming titles are finding their way to 2024!\"\nThe Plucky Squire, a game that bounces between 2D and 3D gameplay, is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Pixel-art platformer Pepper Grinder is currently slated to arrive on Switch and PC. Meanwhile, roguelite brawler Stick it to the Stickman, kickflipping sports-action game Skate Story, and foot-based first-person shooter Anger Foot are currently only listed for PC. \nYou can see the full Devolver Delayed Showcase below.\n\n\nDevolver Digital has had a solid 2023, with titles like Terra Nil receiving positive reviews, fan-favorite Bleak Sword DX making its way to Switch and PC, and new content for Cult of the Lamb, but today's delays are sure to disappoint some. However, by this point in time, many players recognize that it's better to delay a game than to launch it before it's ready, and with Gunbrella and The Talos Principle 2 still slated for 2023, the indie publisher still has seemingly a lot in store for fans before the calendar changes over to 2024.",

After 13 years, that finally changes with a surprise jump to PlayStation 4 and Switch.\nRockstar announced today that Double Eleven Studios is creating these ports, which include the zombie-themed Undead Nightmare expansion in one package. This also means that PlayStation 5 players can experience the game due to PS4 backwards compatibility. While it's unclear if these versions feature any kind of performance or graphical improvements, they do have additional language support for simplified and traditional Chinese, Korean, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, and Latin American Spanish. \n\n\nRed Dead Redemption follows former outlaw John Marston on a quest to track down the remaining members of his old crew, the Van der Linde Gang, in order to save his family. Its prequel, Red Dead Redemption II, arrived in 2018. If you missed out on the original the first time around, you can pick up Red Dead Redemption digitally on PS4 and Switch on August 17 for $49.99.

During this weekend's Evo 2023 fighting game tournament, we received a host of new announcements, including new characters added to the roster of the upcoming Mortal Kombat 1 and even a surprise TMNT collaboration with Street Fighter 6. However, Capcom didn't stop there, as it gave us the first teaser trailer for its 20th playable character, A.K.I.\nDescribed as \"a manaical poison aficionado,\" A.K.I. certainly seems to fit right in with the long lineage of over-the-top and deranged characters within the Street Fighter universe. You can check out the surprisingly dark teaser trailer for A.K.I. below.\n\n\nWhile we already knew A.K.I. was planned, the teaser comes hot on the heels of the release of Rashid, the first DLC character for Street Fighter 6. Rashid debuted in Street Fighter V, but joined the roster of Street Fighter 6 less than two weeks prior to this teaser. A.K.I. arrives in Street Fighter 6 this fall. Both characters – as well as the two remaining members of Year 1, Ed and Akuma – are included in the Deluxe Edition, Ultimate Edition, or Year 1 Character Pass. Rashid is also currently available for individual purchase for 350 Fighter Coins (approximately $7). Regardless of how you obtain Rashid, you also get his secondary outfit and two additional color options. It stands to reason that A.K.I. will follow a similar release method. \nFor more on Street Fighter 6, check out our glowing review of the game, as well as our cover story.

Reptile is back in his more human form but can still shapeshift into his natural, intimidating lizard body to devour opponents.  \nFans of 2004’s Mortal Kombat: Deception should be happy to see the returns of Ashrah and Havik. Each made their debut in that game, and neither has appeared in the series since Deception’s follow-up, Mortal Kombat: Armageddon in 2006. Ashrah sports a much different look and moveset but remains a demoness mostly cleansed of her inherent evil. Havik appears to retain his chaotic brand of body-contorting, limb-tearing offense. Sareena has also been confirmed as a new Kameo fighter to fan the flame of 2000s nostalgia. Check out the new trailer and a fresh batch of screenshots below. \n\n\n       \n\nMortal Kombat 1 launches on September 19 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.

In this world – Ziêminal – there's no good and no evil; just monsters and enemies in your way. And if today's Deathbound trailer is anything to go on, they won't go down without a fight. \nCheck out the Deathbound reveal trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, players can freely switch between various heroes of different classes in a party at any time, and they'll need to do so to survive in specific situations. Trialforge Studio calls this a \"Binding System, allowing players to absorb the essence of the fallen warriors found throughout the world.\" Using the collected essence, players can obtain new skills and abilities to transform their playstyle, or they can use it to form a party of heroes they can then switch between. \nBinding also unlocks Morphstrikes, which combines all of a party's power into a devastating blow. \n\n\"The memories and identities of the fallen will be uncovered through Binding as well,\" a press release reads. \"In addition to environment and items, essence will reveal the narrative behind the world of Ziêminal and its inhabitants. Though players must tread carefully when Binding, as not all heroes converge harmoniously. The conflicts caused by divergent essences absorbed will greatly impact the gameplay and narrative alike.\" \nDeathbound is due out sometime in 2024 on Steam.",

While handheld titles, the poorly received Sonic the Hedgehog 4, and other games like Sonic Generations and Sonic Colors contained 2D gameplay, Sonic Mania felt like the true successor to the beloved titles that appeared on Genesis and Sega CD throughout the 1990s. A sequel felt all but inevitable, but when Sega and Sonic Mania mastermind Christian Whitehead decided to amicably go in creatively different directions (read the full story here), Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka still wanted to build on the success experienced with Sonic Mania.\n\"During Sonic Mania's development, I didn't expect this level of fan reaction or success,\" Iizuka says. \"That success created the opportunity to think a…",

The game’s eerie atmosphere and lack of dialogue lend to the game’s enigmatic nature, and multiple endings offer various truths about the threat you face.\n\n\nSomerville launched for Xbox and PC last November to generally warm reviews, though was noted for its rough technical performance, which has since been improved in post-launch updates. In a press release, Jumpship promises the PlayStation port will be the “best version of Somerville yet” and will feature DualSense haptic feedback.\nFor more on Somerville, you can read Game Informer's Somerville review and editor Kyle Hilliard's opinion piece on why it's the best alien invasion game since Half-Life 2.",

These include production coordinator Sebastian Marlow, associate producer Nora Falcon, senior environment artist Matthew Smith, and VFX artist Matt Christopherson. \nA spokesperson for Krafton, Striking Distance’s parent company, gave the following statement to IGN: \n“Striking Distance Studios and Krafton have implemented strategic changes that realign the studio’s priorities to better position its current and future projects for success. Unfortunately, these changes have impacted 32 employees. Honoring the invaluable contributions of each departing team member with material support in the form of outplacement services and meaningful severance packages is our top priority during this difficult moment.”\nStriking Distance was founded in 2019 by Dead Space co-creator Glen Schofield alongside industry veterans. The Callisto Protocol was its first title, released in December 2022. Set in a prison on Jupiter’s moon of Callisto in 2320, it follows an inmate’s escape following an alien outbreak. The game received a mixed reception from critics and players; we scored it a 6 out of 10 in our review. It was reported in January that The Callisto Protocol underperformed in sales compared to its reportedly massive budget. \nThe Callisto Protocol’s story expansion, Final Transmission, was released on June 28.  \n[Source: IGN]",

However, if you’ve been paying attention to the Call of Duty space, it’s no surprise that this year’s Call of Duty is Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. It’s leaked in various ways already, including on special Monster energy drink packaging (thanks, CharlieIntel). \nJokes on you, real key art here.\npic.twitter.com/UCCexH7IMr\nAugust 2, 2023\nAs you can see, the official Call of Duty Twitter account says, “We’ll share our artistic abilities and even more next week,” alongside fake key art poking fun at redacted Modern Warfare III information leaking ahead of its official reveal. This aligns with a recent Modern Warfare II Season 5 blog post, which announced that the next Call of Duty would be revealed in-game through a “special event.” \nIt seems that reveal is happening next week, although when or how remains unclear. Interestingly, the reveal of a new Call of Duty releasing this year contrasts with reports from early last year stating Call of Duty would skip 2023. \nIn the meantime, read how Lara Croft, Nicki Minaj, Snoop Dogg, and 21 Savage are coming to Modern Warfare II and Warzone, and then read Game Informer’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II review. Check out this story about how Sony signed a 10-year agreement with Microsoft to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation after that. \nAre you excited for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III?

          "description": "Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson has revealed that the publisher is working on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One ports of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.\nHe did so during EA’s company Q1 earnings call yesterday, as reported by The Verge. Survivor launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC earlier this year, in April, and received critical acclaim – Game Informer gave it a 9.25, making it a must-play game. But it skipped the PS4 and Xbox One generation that its predecessor, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, launched on. \n\n\n“Thanks to the strength of this legendary franchise and community demand, our development team has committed to bringing this Jedi experience to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,” Wilson said during the call, according to The Verge. \nFallen Order launched on PS4 and Xbox One with some technical difficulties, and while Survivor wasn’t perfect on that front, it performed a lot better on the now current-gen hardware. It will be interesting to see how it performs on the previous-gen hardware that Fallen Order had difficulties with. As for when to expect this Survivor port, it sounds like it could be a while because IGN reports that Wilson said the port is “in the early stages of development.” \nWhile waiting for it to hit PS4 and Xbox One one day, read Game Informer’s Star Wars Jedi: Survivor review and then read about how the game’s director wants the series to be a trilogy. Watch our video interview with Cal Kestis actor Cameron Monaghan about the sequel after that. \n[Source: The Verge]\nAre you waiting to play Star Wars Jedi: Survivor on PS4 or Xbox One?

Ubisoft released the second DLC, The Last Spark Hunter, last month and now, we know when DLC 3 completes the game’s post-launch roadmap because Rayman in the Phantom Show goes live on August 30. \nYou can check out the Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope DLC 3: Rayman in the Phantom Show reveal trailer for yourself below: \n\n\n“Rayman is back,” the trailer’s description reads. “And he is the special guest in a new mysterious dimension: the Phantom Opera’s network studio. The Phantom, the charismatic ghostly boss of Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle, is also coming back and asking for help to improve his channel’s ratings.” \nWhen Ubisoft revealed its post-launch content roadmap for Sparks of Hope last year, it said Rayman would be featured in DLC 3 and now, almost a year later, he’s finally here. \nSparks of Hope’s Rayman in the Phantom Show DLC hits the game on August 30. \nWhile waiting for this DLC to go live, read Game Informer’s Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope review. For more Mario, check out the reveal trailer for Super Mario Bros. Wonder and then watch the Super Mario RPG remake trailer afterward.\nAre you playing through Rayman in the Phantom Show later this month? Let us know in the comments below!",

Mitchell enlisted several others to the studio for its leadership with experience at Double Fine, Valve, Naughty Dog, Riot Games, and Blizzard Entertainment. Now, the studio has more than four dozen employees and is hard at work developing a shooter it hopes has 10,000 hours of depth and fosters incredible communities and lasting friendships. \nWhile its first game remains unannounced technically, Mountaintop tweeted a short teaser today with the caption, “Soon.” Hopefully, we will get more information about the game soon because this teaser looks interesting. Check it out for yourself below: \nSoon. pic.twitter.com/vEWhnFPsTb\nAugust 1, 2023\nAs you can see, the video teases some of the characters and locales of the game, all of which look pretty comic book-y, with a very stylized aesthetic. The symbols at the end might hint at different factions in the game, and the teaser seems to quickly highlight a few maps players will be shooting each other on. \n“For the last three years, we’ve been hard at work on our first project, a competitive shooter for those that love the genre,” a hiring post from last month reads on the studio’s website. “As we shift into production, we’re looking for more talented individuals to join our time of fully-remote veterans.\n\"The game is set in a brand new universe, inspired by our favorite comics, anime, and manga. It’s a world where players can build a legacy through teamwork and competition.” \n\nWe’ll watch for more information on Mountaintop’s first game and update you on Game Informer. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's list of the top 10 shooters to play right now and then check out our top scoring reviews of 2023. \nWhat do you think of the game’s teaser?

Shortly after, Jujutsu Kaisen’s Gojo, Megumi, Nobara, and Yuhi crash through that wall, revealing the first look at these skins in-game. \nYou can check out the Jujutsu Kaisen Fortnite skins for yourself in the teaser below:\n\n\nFortnite’s anime crossovers began with Naruto in 2021, followed by Dragon Ball Z and My Hero Academia last year. While some players have criticized the visuals of some of the earlier anime characters added to Fortnite (looking at you, Goku and Vegeta), Epic Games’ creations have only become better over the years. It brought Attack On Titan characters to Fortnite this year, and those skins looked great, and these Jujutsu Kaisen skins also look good. \nAs for when to expect Gojo, Megumi, Nobara, and Yuji, the Fortnite Twitter account says they hit the game alongside the release of Update 25.30, which goes live next week on August 8. \nFortnite is no stranger to crossovers. The current season brought Transformers’ Optimus Prime to the game, and back in May, Miles Morales and Miguel O’Hara’s Spider-Men iterations hit the battle royale. That same month saw Star Wars' Anakin, Padme, Darth Maul, and more join Fortnite. And before that, Adonis Creed entered the ring shortly after Dragon Ball Super’s Piccolo and Gohan. \nAre you going to pick up any of these Jujutsu Kaisen Fortnite skins?

          "description": "Nintendo’s next console will reportedly be portable like the Switch and is targeting a release in the second half of 2024, according to a new report today from VideoGamesChronicle. \nVGC cites “multiple people with knowledge of Nintendo’s next-gen console plans” that reveal Nintendo’s Switch successor is aiming for a release in the second half of next year, to ensure there’s plenty of stock at launch. Nintendo wants to avoid the stock shortages that plagued the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S release for months (and years for some). \n\n\nThe publication reports that two of its sources suggest the next-generation console will use LCD screens, like those seen on the launch versions of the Switch, rather than the OLED screens used in the Switch OLED models. The use of LCD reduces costs, VGC writes, in light of the likely need for significantly more storage than what’s in the Switch, which will increase costs. \nVGC’s sources also suggest Nintendo’s next console will be playable on the go, similar to the Switch’s console-handheld hybrid nature. Its sources also say the console will continue using physical cartridges like the Switch, although it’s unclear if this console will be backwards compatible with the Switch.\nIn February of last year, Nintendo said the Switch was in the middle of its lifecycle, meaning that while a new Nintendo console might launch next year, the company might not necessarily abandon the Switch any time soon. However, if Nintendo continues support of the Switch alongside a next-gen console, it’s unclear how that will work as, presumably, this new console will be a good bit more powerful than the Switch. \nRegardless of how Nintendo approaches Switch support following the release of a new console and backwards compatibility, the Super Mario Bros. maker likely wants to convert the Switch’s massive install base into its following product. \n[Source: VideoGamesChronicle]\nWhat do you want from a next-gen Nintendo console?

          "description": "A little while has passed since the release of 2.7.0, and we are now excited to present you with the bugfix release 2.7.1.\nWe have included a significant amount of fixes and small improvements, in particular:\nAdded ScummVM Log file viewer, so you can easily report the problems on platforms with limited file access, e.g. Android, iOS or even modern Windows.\nFixed the shader-based scaler loading on some platforms.\nAdded multiple improvements to AGI, AGS, Cryomni3D and 12 more engines.\nWe also improved the detection of Broken Sword 1 & Broken Sword 2, so more original versions get properly detected. Thank you to those who submitted bug reports about this, and if you still locate a version that is not recognised, please report it to us (beware that the frankenstein versions that are floating around the internet will not be accepted, only those copied from the original media).\nFor the full and comprehensive list of notable changes, please refer to the Release Notes.\nIf you are as excited about the release as we are, you can share our joy by downloading it from our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS, or either of the Ubuntu Snap or Flatpack packages, the autoupdater will pick up the ScummVM 2.7.1 release automatically. For our Android app users, the update will be available on the Play Store.\nThank you very much for your continued support. Enjoy!\n>",

          "description": "Adibou, the first game in the beloved children's series, is now ready for public testing!\nAlso known as Adi Jr.'s World of Discoveries, this 1991 Coktel Vision title began the educational Adibou collection aimed at children of age 4 to 7 years.\nMany of the iconic activities and mechanisms of the series were already part of this first opus: planting flowers, playing the game Breakout, and being rewarded with sweets upon completing Read/Count exercises. And of course, this was Adibou's first appearance! Although the floppy release has him speak the same strange gibberish as heard in the Goblins series, he is still the patient and funny learning partner that he's remembered for being in later games.\nScummVM supports all of the game's releases, from the initial 16-color floppy ones to later 1994 CD versions with richer graphics and sound effects. So dig out your dusty Adibou disks, get a ScummVM daily development build, and start collecting sweets while completing math and reading exercises! Please also contact us if you own a version ScummVM is not yet aware of, and report to the issue tracker any problem you may encounter.\nAs much as ScummVM aims to replicate the original gaming experience, there is one feature we are unfortunately unable to support. When hardworking children complete their virtual sweets collection, a message invites them to mail a floppy disk with their savegame to Coktel Vision, who would send them a parcel containing Coktel goodies and actual sweets! So if you are introducing children to Adibou through ScummVM, be prepared to go to the nearest shop and buy some candy for when they finish the game!\n>",
