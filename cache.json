Everyone else who plays it seems to build enormous, elaborate, impressively well organised structures that are even kind of beautiful. I build a random pile of crap.

          "description": "It’s kind of remarkable how little we really know about Nvidia’s next gaming graphics cards, the RTX 40 series. AMD are openly working on next-gen, RDNA 3-based Radeon GPUs, and Intel are gearing up for the full launch of their Arc Alchemist cards before the end of summer – yet there’s not been so much as a single presentation slide on Nvidia’s wares. Not the kind of hype-building you’d expect, given how many of the current generation’s best graphics cards have GeForce badges.\r\n\n\r\nArriving to fill that info void are, inevitably, leaks. If you don’t regularly hang out in PC hardware circles, know that there’s a veritable cottage industry of in-the-know insiders: anonymous but widely known tipsters like Greymon55 and kopite7kimi, who’ve shared enough accurate details on previous GPU and CPU launches that at least some of their sources are solid. Recently, unannounced Nvidia cards like the RTX 4070, RTX 4080 and especially the RTX 4090 have become this industry’s hottest commodities, meaning leakers are also the primary source of GeForce details for the gaming tech world at large.\r\n\n \nRead more",

That guy who believes Gears Of War and badminton have more in common than you might think, and reckon Gears is the closest thing we'll get to a proper badminton game.\nBadminton aside, running is another pastime that's become dearer to me over the last few years. And that's a universally understood form of exercise, right? Especially when compared to the likes of badminton. So, why are there no proper games about running? I'd like one.\nRead more",

I say all this because Saints Row - not to be confused with Saints Row yet also to be confused with Saints Row - whisked me back to the early 2000s, when I was but a naïve teenager whose life largely pivoted around their Xbox 360. A time when Saints Row and Saints Row 2 were lighthearted Grand Theft Auto alternatives, then Saints Row: The Third came along and cranked up the silliness, and then Saints Row 4 grabbed the lever and cranked it so hard it snapped. So, yes, this year's Saints Row reboot is technically Saints Row 5, except it’s more of a careful reboot. Where does it really sit on the timeline? At both ends, I reckon.\nRead more",

          "description": "Forza Horizon 5’s Hot Wheels expansion is out and reader, I am in love. Firmly leaning – shoving, really – into the base game’s arcadey side, it’s a gleefully silly collection of physics-mocking race events across an eye-catching tangle of twisting, looping tracks. In between challenges, and flashbacks to covering the floor of my grandparents’ house with ribbons of orange plastic, I’ve also been testing how the DLC’s new skybound setting performs on PC.\r\n\n \nRead more",

This here is Clanfolk, a settlement sim about a family of Scottish tamagotchis. The first thing you'll be screaming at me, as if I have not noticed, is how recognisably Rimworldy it looks. You're right. Considering RimWorld cribbed plenty of its own notes from Dwarf Fortress and Prison Architect, it might feel incongruous to criticise Clanfolk for clinging too tightly to the hem of its inspiration. Sadly, it's true. It is a drier, slower and more bucolic take on the exact same game. \nRead more",

The studio’s latest feels at once unique and distinct – and yet clearly carries that Arkane DNA, which has been fine-tuned with each successive release. It's an ethos encapsulated by the game’s own time loop, in which protagonist Colt Vahn relives the same day again and again as he searches for a way to break free of it - an idea that was, among other things, designed to encourage something hardcore Arkane fans had been doing already – replaying the game over and over again.\nWhile Dishonored had gently suggested repeat playthroughs with its kill/non-lethal runs, plenty of players still called it a day at the end of their first playthrough. Deathloop needed a more direct approach, its developers tell us.\nRead more",

Ever since the first Shelter game where my sweet baby badger got snatched up by the claws of a giant eagle, I’ve learned that these adorable animal games can be pretty ruthless. It’s the maternal connection that gets me, the pang of loss for something you were supposed to protect. It shoots right between the ribs and straight into the heart. Ow.\nEndling - Extinction Is Forever is one such game. You play as a fox mother trying to keep her four cubs alive in a post-apocalyptic world, and from that premise alone it definitely feels like developers Herobeat Studios are deadset on making me cry. After playing through the game in two evenings, Endling didn’t end up being the emotional gut punch I had braced myself for, but its story of scrappy survival did have me reaching for the tissues by the closing credits. What can I say, I see an animal in distress and I’m a weepy mess.\nRead more",

As an owner of two tortoiseshells myself, they've unlocked routes in our house I never knew existed, using the tiny lip of our fridge as a gateway to the top of our kitchen cupboards, bed frames as launch pads to the middle bar of our sash windows (not even the actual window sill, those daft beasts), and don't even get me started on how they managed to get onto the top of our 2cm wide shower rail that one time.\nStray, BlueTwelve Studio's cat 'em up explorathon, puts you in the paws of a similarly savvy feline protagonist. The cat itself is a marvel of digital observation, fully inhabiting all of the best cat-isms I know and love. You can scratch the backs of sofas and knead and shred carpets with alternate squeezes of the trigger buttons, meow at will, lap from dripping water bowls, topple piles of carefully stacked books and push paint cans off the edge of ledges - and, if you leave them idle long enough, they'll stretch and catch flies too tiny to be caught by the human eye. You can also play a mean game of billiards, much to the annoyance of the local robots. I wouldn't go as far as saying it loosened my jaw quite as much as when I first set eyes on Trico from The Last Guardian, all told, but I reckon if BlueTwelve had the same kind of budget and scale as GenDesign and Sony's Japan Studio did back then, then Stray's cat would be every bit the equal of that famous cat-bird-chimera.\nRead more",

They do this by apparently journeying over a board of randomised roguelike encounters, stopping at each one for either a Gwent battle or an event, before facing off against a final boss to bag a mutagen needed for their radical experiments. \nRead more",

          "description": "The classic meme lives on in a Stray mod\nLong after the conversations about David Cage's infamous 2010 game Heavy Rain have faded away, one meme lives on in a single word: \"Jason!\" For those who may be blissfully unaware, in the game, there's a moment where the player has to hit X to yell for their missing son Jason. It became a classic meme pretty much overnight, and cemented Heavy Rain's place as one of the most notorious games of all time.\nFast forward to 2022, and Stray is winning the hearts of gamers everywhere with its adorable, fuzzy protagonist. Because you're playing as a cat, there's even a whole button dedicated to meowing... oh wait, I see where they're going with this. Modder Gibrietas took one look at that button and knew what they had to do -- mod Stray so that instead of meowing, your cat yells \"Jason\" (originally spotted by IGN).\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJIsgvTYxII\nNow I guess I need to buy the PC version of this game too so I can mod it, because the idea of running around a dystopian cyberpunk city as a cat yelling \"Jason\" at everyone seems like a pretty awesome way to get to experience the game. Not only that, but you're also gonna be yelling \"Jason\" in various tones and inflections, as is true to Heavy Rain. Kudos to you, Gibrietas, for dedicating yourself to that level of detail.\nWhile the JASON mod is easily the most ridiculous we've seen of the Stray mods, it's only one of many. I personally love that most of the mods for the game on Nexus are reskins of the protagonist so that gamers can play with a cat that looks like their own. Other highlights include one that allows your cat to wear glasses, one that turns the loading screen into Nyan Cat, and one that makes the cat slightly fatter.\nThe post This Stray mod turns a meow into the “Jason” scream from Heavy Rain appeared first on Destructoid.",

It was touted as a sequel to Cybernator. It’s not, but we’ll get to that. I said I didn’t have that kind of money to drop on a single game. Well, time makes fools of us all, as now I have a copy. Don't ask.\nMetal Warriors is something I only knew existed because of its value. I have a whole book on the history of Lucasarts, and I don’t remember it even mentioning it (though it has been a while since I last cracked its spine).

          "description": "The NBA star can soon dunk on Bugs Bunny\nWarner Bros. platform fighter MultiVersus is adding some more combatants to its roster. LeBron is set to join the MultiVersus lineup on July 26, while animated duo Rick and Morty arrive as part of Season One.\nMultiVersus is currently in a closed alpha, but the game goes into open beta next week on July 26. LeBron's debut will coincide with the open beta, bringing passes, dunks, and three-pointers to the melee.\nIt's worth noting that this is LeBron as he appeared in Space Jam: A New Legacy. Which, granted, he appeared as himself in that movie. But that means he'll be donning the Toon Squad jersey and doing some basketball moves beyond conventional, human bounds. It seems like the main mechanic involves passing the ball around and going for big dunks.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMnx77Djnu4\nVoicing LeBron is John Bentley, who also lent his vocal talents to Barrett Wallace in 2020's Final Fantasy VII Remake.\nRick and Morty, meanwhile, will be waiting a little longer for their debut. The pair will be arriving in MultiVersus sometime in its first season.\nhttps://twitter.com/multiversus/status/1550539268098953216/\nA massive crossover\nMultiVersus is Warner Bros. and Player First Games' take on the Smash Bros. concept. It boasts crossovers from across a bunch of Warner Bros. properties, ranging from Shaggy and Velma to Harley Quinn, Bugs Bunny, the Iron Giant, and soon, LeBron James.\nIs this an absolutely bonkers character idea? Of course. But I really dig it. Part of the appeal in these crossover platform fighters is seeing a bunch of recognizable faces duke it out, and while LeBron's made game cameo appearances before, just the possibility of dunking on Batman as LeBron seems reason enough to try Multiversus out.\nMultiVersus goes into open beta on July 26, though you can also get in now with early access via Twitch drops or purchasing a Founder's Pack.\nThe post LeBron, Rick and Morty coming to MultiVersus appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Jackbox is back again\nIt seems like yesterday that Jackbox games came out for the first time and revolutionized the party game scene, but they just announced their newest release: Jackbox Party Pack 9. How we went through so many Party Packs this quickly is beyond me, but given how much I play these games at my own events, I'm excited to have another set of games to try out.\nI have to admit I always look forward to seeing the theming of each Party Pack, and this time each of the games are made to look like a billboard, with the number 9 floating in the sky like a cloud — cute.\nThe games in Jackbox Party Pack 9 include:\nQuixort, a co-op trivia sorting game where players will have to sort a series of blocks in order thanks to the help of some little robots.\nJunktopia, a storytelling game where players are turned into frogs by an evil wizard, and must earn their way back into the wizard's good graces by giving random objects amusing backstories to increase their values.\nRoomerang, a role-playing game where players take on the role of gameshow contestants and must answer prompts and avoid elimination.\nFibbage 4, the return of a classic where players must bluff and get other players to believe their false answers.\nAnd finally Nonsensory, a laid-back game where players write, draw, and try to guess the silly things that their friends wrote and drew.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HaToA3lew8\nThe return of Fibbage also brings some new features along as well, like Fibbage Enough About You mode, Cookie's VHS Vault, Fibbage Fan Questions, and more. If you want to see the new games in action, you can also check out the livestream event that Jackbox put on in conjunction with Gish.\nThe Jackbox Party Pack 9 is set to release this fall, so we'll have plenty of fun new games to try out at our parties in the coming months.\nThe post Jackbox reveals all five games featured in Jackbox Party Pack 9 appeared first on Destructoid.",

There's a good chance we'll see some other classic Batman villains as well. But it sounds like the Joker won't be among the rogue's gallery of Gotham Knights.\nSpeaking at San Diego Comic Con 2022 yesterday (via IGN), Gotham Knights creative director Patrick Redding says the Joker won't be in Gotham Knights. The door's still open for another clown-crime doer though; Redding would not confirm or deny whether Harley Quinn is in the game.\nRedding also notes that Batman is \"really dead\" in Gotham Knights. There's been some speculation that may not be the real case, and who knows? Bat-stories have pulled off stranger twists. But for now, the focus is on the extended Bat-family.\nTo wit, there was also a new trailer shown, spotlighting Batgirl's crimefighting capabilities.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxJcx86-vJU\nA bad night in Gotham\nIt seems like Batgirl's got the usual lineup of Bat-gadgets and gizmos in Gotham Knight. She also has her own Bat-bike, which looks like it could make a big entrance.\nI'm really a fan of the baton she has though. At multiple points it acts a regular blunt object or like a tonfa, but we also see it extend out into a longer reach weapon and cause shockwaves. Seems like she's set on making sure Gotham's evildoers don't stop fearing the bat symbol, even in Bruce's absence.\nBatgirl is one of the four playable characters in Gotham Knights, alongside Robin, Nightwing, and Red Hood. And while she won't get to take down the Joker, she and the other crimefighters will still have plenty to deal with in the Court of Owls, it seems.\nGotham Knights will take a bit out of crime on October 25, 2022 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.\nThe post The Joker won’t show up in Gotham Knights appeared first on Destructoid.",

Well, thanks to this post on reddit by imnotgoats that's been gaining traction this week, you might have an option before sending it off to Nintendo for repair.\nIf your Switch Pro Controller is dead, try the sync button\nAlthough Switch Pro Controllers have a fairly good reputation, it isn't foolproof. Some folks, even after years of use, have reported that their controllers have entered a weird state where they seem completely dead. As in, the battery seems to be out of operation, and no amount of charging will work (the charging light won't even come on).\nAs the reddit thread points out, even swapping docks/cables might not solve the issue. However, upon pressing the sync button, the controller \"sprang to life,\" and hasn't had the same issue. It's such a simple little fix but it's not something a lot of folks wouldn't think of in the moment. I mean logic would dictate that plugging it into a perfectly working cable and dock and not having the charging light come on indicates a critical battery issue, but there is one last ray of hope with the sync button.\nSomeone in the post even mentions they've had one that's been sitting on a shelf for at least a year with this problem! Another good point is that a lot of folks play with it permanently plugged into a PC, and wouldn't even think to ever press the sync button for any reason.\nThe Switch Pro Controller is still incredible\nThe Switch Pro Controller might be my single favorite device of this generation, just because of how stable it is. It holds a charge for...forever, to the point where I just don't even need to think about it. Plus, the Monster Hunter Rise special edition Pro looks gorgeous, so I get to look down every once in a while and enjoy the design.

          "description": "A novel concept for a horror escape game\nPlenty of games have gimmicks. But I think Refund Me If You Can might be the first time I've seen a game use a storefront's refund policy as a gameplay mechanic.\nFreshly arrived on Steam today, I noticed Refund Me If You Can pop up on the TodayOnSteam automated bot account. It's a handy account for noticing strange and eccentric new releases, and this horror game in particular started to catch folks' eyes as it spread around.\nThe premise of Sungame Studio's experience is that you are locked in a maze, with a monster tracking you down. Your equipment is sparse: just a flashlight and a couple of neon flares, to leave as markers for your future self. You need to find an exit, and find one fast. Not just because of the monster, mind you, but also because you've got a time limit.\n\nAccording to its Steam page, Refund Me If You Can has \"more than 100\" paths, but only one leads out. And the entire time, in the upper-left corner, the clock is ticking down.\n\"After two hours the sucess [sic] will be locked forever.\" Essentially, it seems like victory is sealed off alongside the refund window.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSmnJqwL6tM\nLittle storefront of horrors\nValve's Steam storefront started offering refunds quite a while ago. They were pretty lenient, with only two qualifiers: you must have bought something in the last two weeks, and played less than two hours of it.\nAnd while independent developers and makers of short games have reported issues with the system, Refund Me If You Can turns it on its head. Can you beat it in two hours? Can you essentially play a game for free, just by beating it?\nIt's a pretty novel way of sticking out, especially in the flooded market of scary horror games. Refund Me If You Can is available for $3.99 on Steam.\nThe post Refund Me If You Can challenges players to beat it within Steam refund window appeared first on Destructoid.",

But if you'd rather play some indoor sports, Nintendo Switch Sports is getting a free update next week that adds some new moves to its various games.

The big one is more leg strap integration with Soccer, allowing you to use real-life kicks full Soccer matches.\nThis should add a little more activity to Soccer, which previously used a mixture of Joy-Con presses and other motions. This option will let you really juice up your kicks with real-life motion. Just make sure your strap is on tight, as you don't want to kick-fling a Joy-Con across the room.\n\nBut if Soccer isn't your jam, there are some other updates coming to other modes. Volleyball gets a few new moves for players to execute, like the Slide Attack and Rocket Serve.\n\nJoin the league\nThe Nintendo Switch Sports update will also add new ranks to the Pro League modes. Joining Friend Matches using Room IDs will also make it easy to connect with others looking to launch soccer balls across the pitch with massive leg swings.\nNintendo Switch Sports is the Switch's take on the classic Wii Sports set-up, mixing motion controls and sporting activities for a family party game experience. It had its ups and downs, as you can read in our review; while mainstays like Bowling and Tennis stay mostly strong, other modes had some struggles.\nHopefully the new moves add a little extra oomph to everyone's virtual Soccer and Volleyball matches.

          "description": "Shrine like a Star\nNatsume Inc's long-awaited sequel Pocky & Rocky Reshrined finally hit PS4 and Nintendo Switch platforms last month, bringing with it nostalgic visuals, great gameplay, and some classic, old-school adventure. It was well received by both critics and fans, for the most part.\nWhile players heaped praise on the franchise's authentic return, many were left understandably frustrated by Natsume's baffling decision to lock the game's multiplayer modes, only accessible once the player has completed Story Mode and bagged themselves 10,000 in-game coins. A bizarre choice, frankly, given Pocky & Rocky's natural propensity for co-op action and its fun cast of new characters. To this day, critics and players have been rendered utterly confuddled by the user-unfriendly decision.\nPerhaps realizing the error of its ways, Natsume has released a new cheat code that will allow you to jump into the co-op action with your buddies immediately, (spotted by Japanese video game fan Gosokkyu/GSK).\nAll you need do is arrive at the Pocky & Rocky Reshrined main menu and enter the following inputs:\nLeft, Left, Left, Left\nRight, Right, Right, Right\nLeft, Right, Left, Right, Left, Right, Left, Right\nOnce you complete this sequence, the auto-save symbol should appear. Now you can access the Free Mode, giving you access to the full roster of characters, and two-player co-op. While I understand that purists might suggest that the multiplayer mode is a \"reward\" for finishing the game, it was simply a foolish move to lock such an intrinsic part of the Pocky AND Rocky experience away from the player base from day one. Still, it's a very cute, very fun, and very challenging sequel. Well worth a look.\nPocky & Rocky Reshrined is available now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post How to unlock Pocky & Rocky Reshrined multiplayer from the start appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Some stories will have gameplay mechanics that inform other eras\nWant a Live A Live tip? While the game is fairly straightforward (you do a series of individual stories that connect) there's one big thing you can do to make everything easier: take some breaks, and don't be afraid to drop in and out of stories.\nAs we talked about in the review, Live A Live is actually comprised of several eras with unique protagonists (with their own sets of skills and equipment):\nPrehistory\nImperial China\nEdo Japan\nWild West\nPresent Day\nNear Future\nDistant Future\nStarting with Imperial China is a good way to get acclimated with Live A Live\nAnother Live A Live tip: you can pick any of them to start with, and really, there's no wrong choice. However! Imperial China is one of the most \"ramp\"-prone stories: meaning, it eases you in more than say, Edo Japan or Present Day, which kick off with higher-stakes combat.\nSpeaking of: combat! If you dive into a story (like the aforementioned two) and are immediately pressed with figuring out Live A Live's combat system, it's totally okay to head to the main menu, then quit to the \"character/story select\" screen. From there you can head into an era that might have a better \"intro\" so to speak, with more time to breathe and learn how to approach the combat grid and the movement mechanic.\nThe post The best Live A Live tip: Don’t be afraid to take breaks and skip around stories appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Striking down with great vengeance\nNexon's rad new fighting title DNF Duel has received its first post-release update, bringing a small fistful of important changes to the rule-breakin' brawler. Now available on both PlayStation and PC, Update 103 brings a couple of much-needed character tweaks as well as adjustments to various modes on PC.\nFirst and foremost, Crusader's reign of holy error is over, (for the most part), as developer Arc System Works has removed the truthsayer's devastating \"Sacred Upper\" infinite combo loop. That's not to say that Crusader is no longer a threat — dude is a monster — but at least that's one particularly silly weapon removed from his arsenal.\nIn addition to this major fix, several other characters have received bug stomps that couldn't wait for a larger balance check down the line. Grappler's \"Break Down\" will now connect on a crouching Enchantress, so no more hiding for the sneaky magical maiden. Striker's Airwalk has had an adjustment made to its gravity mechanics, while Lost Warrior's Mysterious Pierce will now interact more consistently when it collides with opposing projectiles. As if that mf'er needed any more help.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf0ZlqM1yfQ\nOn PC, several changes have been made to optimize player interaction with offline modes. Training Mode will no longer be confused when dealing with recorded actions made via custom button layouts, while keyboard players will no longer find themselves randomly isolated from their controls during online matches. In regards to full balance changes and mechanic tweaks, a further major update is expected at some point in the near future.\nDon't buy into the naysaying. DNF Duel is an accessible, silly, and fun fantasy fighter — boasting a fun cast, cool visuals, and tight online play. It is available now on PlayStation and PC platforms.\nThe post DNF Duel update brings the holy hammer down on Crusader appeared first on Destructoid.",

But if you're a PC owner wanting in on the fast-paced, retro-styled action, then fear not, as Inti Creates has announced that the cool-looking release will be getting a Steam port this winter.\nAs we have previously reported, Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 is the long-awaited third chapter in a saga that began on Nintendo 3DS way back in 2014. This new chapter will see dual heroes Gunvolt and Kirin hack, slash, and shoot their way through flashy 2.5D platform action. Switching between the two characters on the fly, players will be encouraged to synergize each character's respective skills to fight off an army of dangerous droids and towering end-of-stage guardians.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3icCimtZdLI\nAdding to this anime-infused chaos, an intriguing new mechanic known as \"Image Pulse\" will enable Gunvolt to utilize his memories of battle to call upon the skills of his former opponents, arming himself with the skills of over 150 allies and enemies from the entire trilogy. Additionally, Gunvolt and Kirin will be guided by the evocative, dulcet tones of their virtual oracle, Anthem, whose song will spearhead the duo's assault and even boost their battle abilities. Some fascinating little features there.\nAzure Striker Gunvolt 3 launches on Nintendo Switch July 28. An Xbox edition will launch on August 2, with the PC port scheduled for this winter. A physical edition is currently in the works at Limited Run Games, with price, details, and release date still to be revealed.\nThe post Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 comes blasting onto PC this winter appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Pandora will have to wait\nUbisoft is pushing one of its games out of this year. The publisher confirms today that Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is moving to fiscal year 2023-2024.\nPreviously set to launch in 2022, this delay pushes Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora out of the year and up to at least April 2023. The news arrived via Ubisoft's financial earnings today, and no more specifics were given on a date.\nIt shouldn't be a huge surprise though, as we've yet to see much of this new Avatar game. While a June 2021 trailer gave us a cinematic look at what's in store, we haven't seen much else in the time since.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Axmg1E4HrVE\nIt does seem to be more of the Navi and space corporation fighting each other, much like in the original Avatar film. The Frontiers of Pandora game is also set for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, but not previous-generation consoles.\nIn its financial statement, Ubisoft says it is working on taking full advantage of next-gen technology, as it sees the Avatar brand as a \"major multi-year opportunity\" for Ubisoft.\nThe fall window ahead\nUbisoft also announced a few more changes to its upcoming slate. First off, it delayed a smaller but unannounced premium game from 2022-2023 into 2023-2024.\nAlso, as noted by Axios' Stephen Totilo on Twitter, Ubisoft canceled development of four more games. These are Splinter Cell VR, Ghost Recon Frontline, and two unannounced games. No further details were given on why.\nThis still leaves two fairly large games in Ubisoft's upcoming fall lineup. Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope is set for October 20, 2022 on Nintendo Switch. And the long-awaited pirate ship sim Skull and Bones finally locked in a date for November 8, on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and cloud services. Those who wanted to fly across the plains of Pandora this year will have to settle for the high seas instead.\nThe post Ubisoft delays Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora into 2023 to 2024 window appeared first on Destructoid.",

The studio will host a Destiny 2 showcase on August 23.\nThe stream will go live on August 23. Though no mention was made of platform, you can probably assume the Bungie Twitch account is a safe bet. No time has been announced just yet.\nhttps://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1550133920838008833\n\"Witness what's next,\" the tweet advertises. Whatever it is, that fleet of pyramid ships sure does seem like bad news for all Guardians out there.\nAs for what's in store, Destiny 2 is still in the throes of wrapping up the story from The Witch Queen expansion. The game is currently in the midst of the Season of the Haunted, which ends on August 23.\nThe light ahead\nA new season is likely in the cards. More content leading up to the next expansion seems pretty likely too. Lightfall is the next expansion due up on Bungie's Destiny 2 roadmap and we don't have a firm picture of that yet, save that it's likely a 2023 launch given Witch Queen's launch this year.\nBungie does have one more expansion confirmed for after Lightfall, dubbed The Final Shape, in the conclusion of what it's calling the Light and Darkness saga. It seems like the roadmap stretches pretty far out into the future for the online shooter.\nThe Destiny 2 studio has also gone through some changes over the last year or so, though. Bungie is now officially a PlayStation studio, as the acquisition has finally closed out.\nIt seems like interesting times ahead for the studio behind the persistent multiplayer sci-fi shooter. We'll see what Bungie has in store for the future of Destiny 2 on August 23.\nThe post Bungie announces Destiny 2 showcase for August 23 appeared first on Destructoid.",

That's all you need to know, as that's a fairly good description of this lounge singer turned Monster Hunter peddler. Around a minute and a half in it gets wackier, with the man showing up in the game with crude effects: it's the best part!\nCapcom has been doing a bang-up job when it comes to its Japanese advertisement arm, as the Resident Evil Village puppet shows are also fantastic. Someone over in that department needs a raise, but given the crossover, just air these on western channels!\nAt this point Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak has been out for a few weeks, and it's been going pretty well for Capcom. Given how long the legs are with modern Monster Hunter games, it seems likely that Sunbreak will eventually arrive in the top 10 all-time seller list for the publisher.\nI'm sure some exec somewhere is singing \"Viva Sunbreak!\" in their offices.\nhttps://twitter.com/MH_Rise_JP/status/1542266661754966017\nThere's more wackiness to be had with Monster Hunter Rise Japanese commercials too, with the comedian ZAZY and actor Yuki Yamada:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTRpJl-UV6c\nThe post This Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak ad proves that Japanese commercials are the best appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Reading for Robots\nQuantic Dream's sci-fi drama title Detroit: Become Human is getting set to make a comeback, but not quite in the form you might have expected. As reported by Famitsu, the 2018 cinematic adventure is being adapted into a manga series, with the first volume of Detroit: Become Human Tokyo Stories hitting the streets of Japan tomorrow.\nChoosing to take its own localized narrative over that of the video game, Detroit: Become Human Tokyo Stories will tell the tale of an android idol, who models, performs, and entertains her fans in the far-flung future of 2038. Much like the video game, however, the manga will confront the typical themes of robotic sentience, the dangers of advanced A.I., and the prejudice of man against those different from themselves. The story is written by Kazami Sawatari with the art daubed by Moto Sumida.\nhttps://twitter.com/sawatari_kazami/status/1549590228934963201?s=20&t=CbiFSUq8L1hu3ltcYh97uQ\nThe new manga is not the first non-gaming adaptation of the Quantic Dream title. In fact, it's not the first time the franchise has focused on Japan for its chin-stroking pontification. Back in 2018, Sony Japan released a short movie, Tokyo: Become Human, to help promote the game's launch within the territory. The new manga genuinely sounds pretty interesting, with themes suited to Japan's love of next-generation technology. Unfortunately, there are currently no plans for an English localization, but perhaps we will see a fan translation down the line.\nDetroit: Become Human is available now on PC and PS4.\nThe post Detroit: Become Human is getting a manga spin-off in Japan appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. \nThe game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. \nWatch on Twitch!\nFallen Order was released on November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. \nJoin Marcus Stewart, Andrew Reiner, and, making his Replay debut, GI web designer/programmer Jon Woodey on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat.

This content update includes an expanded version of the game’s Mercenaries mode, introducing Chris Redfield, Karl Heisenberg, and Lady Dimitrescu as playable characters. A new trailer shows off each of their abilities and how players can tear through hordes of monstrosities as this powerful trio. \n\n\nThe update, called The Mercenaries Additional Orders, adds two new stages, Bloody Village and Bloody River, and lets players mow down adversaries such as the weapon-strapped Chris Redfield. When his arsenal of guns isn’t enough, the former BSAA agent packs a powerful punch that can have foes reeling, and activating his Onslaught gauge grants him an absurd speed boost, letting him move and reload in the blink of an eye. When all else fails, Chris can call in support strikes by pinpointing targets with his locator. \nIf you want to get your Magneto on, Heisenberg can use his electromagnetic powers to toss buzzsaws and other objects, channel lightning, and smash foes with his massive hammer. He can also call in his Soldat Jets to lend a hand. \nThe towering Lady D handles threats by slicing them to bits with her intimidating claws, which builds up a Thrill meter. Spending this meter allows her to use special moves such as summoning her psychotic daughters.

In the trailer above, we see her acrobatic maneuvers make short work of a gang. The footage also shows what appears to be a boss fight and a couple of alternate skins that players can unlock for Barbara Gordon.\nSlated to release on October 25 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, Gotham Knights tells the story of a Batman-less superhero world and shows how his wards rise to take his place. The playable characters are Robin, Nightwing, Red Hood, and Batgirl. You can play whoever you want, and it won't disrupt the game's cooperative play. Warner Bros. allows two Batgirls to run together, should players wish to attain an Elseworlds vibe.\nThe skins shown in the video will likely need to be unlocked by finding blueprints and acquiring the proper crafting materials to build them.\nFollowing the success of Rocksteady's Arkham series and Warner Bros. Montreal's contribution, Gotham Knights has enormous shoes to fill. Here's hoping it's every bit as good as the titles mentioned. We need another great Arkham-like game.",

While the story beats will be mostly the same, Naughty Dog has reworked most of the gameplay and visuals.\nAlong with increased realism in the character models, players can expect seamless transitions between sequences, enhanced enemy and buddy A.I., more breakable objects in combat, accessibility features galore, and even a few new ways to play the game.\nIf you want to see how far you make it before dying, you can play a new permadeath mode. Naughty Dog has also added a speed run mode to see how quickly players get through the story.\nYour time revisiting this amazing game is rewarded with new unlockables, like outfits for Ellie and Joel and a model viewer. The Last of Us Part 1 is slated to release on PlayStation 5 and PC on September 2.\nAre you excited to revisit this classic? If so, will you play The Last of Us Part II right after you finish it?",

          "description": "Ubisoft has reportedly canceled several in-development titles, including the previously announced Ghost Recon Frontline and Splinter Cell VR.\nThe publisher announced the cancellations in an investor call, part of the same earnings report that revealed the delay of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. Ghost Recon Frontline was a battle royale take on the franchise unveiled last October. It boasted 100+ player matches and was positioned as Ubisoft's next big live-service title. Outside of a planned closed beta that never came to pass, Frontline never had a release window, and the game was heavily criticized by fans who wanted a more traditional Ghost Recon experience. You can watch the reveal trailer below. \n\n\nSplinter Cell VR was revealed in September 2020, and it was to be a brand-new Splinter Cell title made from the ground up for virtual reality. The game hadn’t made much of a peep since then. Assassin’s Creed VR, which was revealed alongside it, still seems to be happening, though. \nUbisoft CFO Frederick Duguet told investors that canceling these titles and the two announced projects was a cost-cutting measure to emphasize “even more focus on our biggest development opportunities.\" \nWhat do you think of these cancellations?

The news comes from Ubisoft’s quarterly sales report. \nUnfortunately, the report, which you can view here, doesn’t narrow down Avatar’s release window more than that. According to The Verge, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot explained in the earnings call that the company plans to make the Avatar franchise a larger gaming brand and that, in regards to Frontiers of Pandora, “It is important for us that we come with something that is perfect.”\nUbisoft had been quiet on Frontiers of Pandora since its big reveal during E3 2021, but it was assumed the game would launch sometime this holiday to coincide with the December 16 theatrical premiere of Avatar: The Way of Water. The first-person action game is built in the Snowdrop Engine, and players control a Na’vi in a new area of Pandora called the Western Frontier. Frontiers of Pandora is being developed by Massive Entertainment, the team behind The Divison. You can watch the E3 reveal trailer below.",

          "description": "Dragon Ball: The Breakers offers a unique spin on the franchise by letting a team of players work together to evade a player-controlled villain in asymmetrical fashion. A new trailer puts on a spotlight on one of those baddies, Lord Frieza, while also confirming an October launch date. \nFor those unaware, The Breakers tasks a team of non-superhuman civilians (including Bulma and Oolong) with escaping the clutches of a powerful mastermind who has imprisoned them in a pocket dimension of sorts. This overseer, known as the Raider, ups the ante by pitting these ordinary captives against powerful antagonists such as Cell, Majin Buu, and, of course, Frieza. The townsfolk can work together or separately to escape to a time machine by using various tools and can apparently harness and utilize the abilities of heroes such as Goku. \nThe new trailer highlights Frieza, showing how players can rain destruction as the emperor of the universe. This player can assume all of Frieza’s traditional transformations (his Golden form is unconfirmed) and unleash attacks such as his planet-destroying Death Ball. He even “Krillins” a victim by pulling them into the air and blowing them up. \n\n\nDragon Ball: The Breakers continues to look as wild as it does humorous, which certainly falls in line with the franchise. It’s launching on October 14 for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. Curious fans will get to try the game beforehand, thanks to a series of closed network tests taking place on the weekend of August 6-7. You can register for that here.",

          "description": "In the 1990s, few characters reached the heights of Sonic the Hedgehog. Shortly after the 1991 launch of the Blue Blur’s debut game on Sega Genesis, his popularity rivaled Nintendo’s behemoth Super Mario franchise. However, much like the roller coasters that inspired Sonic’s original gameplay and level design, the subsequent decades included plenty of highs and lows. Even after a quick jump off the starting line, many feared the series was doomed to fall short of its potential forever.\nHowever, the brand has experienced something of a renaissance in recent years. The Sonic the Hedgehog franchise is perhaps nearly as popular now as when it burst onto the scene just over three decades ago, bolstered by blockbuster movies, beloved comics, and promising streaming shows. Sonic Mania proved a successful retro reinvention, but the core development staff at Sonic Team has yet to deliver the final piece of the puzzle: a mainline game restoring the series’ legacy as one of the premier platformers.\nSega and Sonic Team think they have that final component with Sonic Frontiers. I traveled to Burbank, California, the American headquarters of Sonic Team, to sink hours into the upcoming open-world game to see if it truly is the fresh direction the franchise needs.\nRead more...",

          "description": "No Man’s Sky’s 20th free update, Endurance, soars into the game today. Hello Games describes Endurance as an “overhaul” to the freighter captain experience, giving players new tools and functionality that make commanding a fleet of ships more entertaining and manageable. \nPlayers can oversee their brigade from a new bridge on their ship deck and now have instant access to teleportation rooms. Players can spacewalk on exterior walkways on their ship, which will provide views of the denser, more varied asteroid fields. Constructing manufacturing facilities lets players produce food and other resources, and you can construct other massive structures upon your capital ship. Perhaps the coolest of all is the ability to collect dreadnaught-sized aliens known as living frigates. Check out the trailer below for a glimpse of these features and others. \n\n\nEndurance goes live today in all versions of No Man’s Sky. Hopefully, that will include the upcoming Switch version, which launches on October 7.",

The game’s reveal caught my eye thanks to its striking art direction and unique gameplay. I’ve spent the last couple of days battling the darkness as the titular Victoria Bloom, a precocious young girl searching her ancestral home for her missing uncle after it’s been overtaken by shadow monsters. Armed with a powerful flashlight, you’ll battle a living darkness in an ever-changing mansion steeped in mystery and secrets. \nI’m enjoying the game, but it took longer than I would’ve liked to get used to its strange control scheme.

In other words, a game that doesn’t have enough simulation to be a sim, action to be an action title, puzzle-solving to be a puzzle game, and… you get the idea. Despite the nebulous classification, games in this genre are unambiguously incredible experiences, often exploring refreshing and fascinating concepts.

These versions take advantage of their more powerful homes by boasting sharper HD visuals, improved framerates, and faster loading. \n\n\nNo More Heroes 3 first arrived on Switch in August 2021. Former GI editor John Carson scored the game a 7.75 out of 10, writing in his review: \n“My time with No More Heroes 3 jumped between the short highs from entertaining bosses and cutscenes to long, ugly stretches in the world. Much of the design is dated, and I wanted to drop it after a few bosses to avoid the mundanity, but I’m happy I saw it to completion. There are many fun moments, and I love how unafraid it is to be strange or referential. Those who are already invested in the tale of Travis Touchdown should be right at home in this new No More Heroes. Still, I’d insist newcomers try out previous entries before diving into this Garden of Insanity.”",

The game's seventh expansion, Legacy of the Sith, was released around that time. Moreover, an upcoming content update promising new daily mission arcs for Republic and Imperial players on Manaan, a challenging operation for 8-player teams, improvements to weapons, and juicy story deets surrounding Darth Malgus is in development.

In a press release, designer Chris McVeigh emphatically said, “We hope that building this classic console takes you back to those halcyon days when a handful of pixels meant a world of adventure.”\nThe Lego Atari 2600 releases on August 1 (this year marks Atari’s 50th anniversary!) and is priced at $239.99.

As much as I enjoyed the Yakuza formula, it was definitely a formula. Like a Dragon has enough familiar elements to make it feel like, at its heart, it's a Yakuza game. All the while, I fully appreciated how much of a new identity this entry is establishing. Here's hoping this is the first step in yet another great journey for the series.\"\n\nI'm excited to see Ichiban's next adventure, whether it's a numbered entry in the franchise or not. \n[Source: Famitsu via VGC]",

          "description": "In 2016, nothing was bigger than Pokémon Go. Mobs of people roamed cities and parks, disrupting traffic in the name of finding the next Pokémon needed to inch closer towards a completed Poké Dex. While the mainstream fervor surrounding Niantic's smash hit has settled significantly, it's still one of the most popular mobile titles in the app stores, surpassing $6 billion in revenue last month. \nThe Pokémon Trading Card Game has recently released special collections commemorating the 25th anniversary of the franchise, the Detective Pikachu movie, and plenty more, but it feels long overdue for Pokémon Go to finally get an expansion devoted to it. That changed this month, as the Pokémon Trading Card Game finally released a special collaboration with the popular mobile title. The expansion is not available through standard booster packs, instead offering boosters exclusively through Elite Trainer Boxes, Battle Decks, Collections, and Tins.\nWe were sent several boxes of this special expansion. As I opened the cards, I noticed the cards tend to feature more Pokémon from Gen I than other generations, which makes sense given the game's peak popularity. That said, various cards I pulled featured Pokémon like Tyranitar, Dragonite, and Blissey, who have, at one point, stood atop the in-game meta of Pokémon Go. It's nice to see those homages, alongside the most iconic Pokémon, the human characters from Pokémon Go, and items like Egg Incubators, Lure Modules, and PokéStops, which are essential parts of the mobile game. This pack also features peel-away Ditto cards, Pokémon exploring photorealistic settings, and Radiant Pokémon. And of course, there's Meltan and Melmetal, who both debuted through Pokémon Go.\nYou can see the large collection of my favorite pulls from this expansion in the gallery below.\n\nThe Pokémon Trading Card Game: Pokémon Go expansion launched on July 1. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking on the banner below!",

That was certainly the case today; this year's TennoCon livestream delivered a new Warframe expansion called The Duviri Paradox, which was only outdone by Digital Extremes announcing its next flagship game. The studio revealed it has begun development on a fantasy game called Soulframe.\nFew details for Soulframe were given, but you can take your first look at the art direction and vibe in the trailer above. You can also go to the studio's official website to solve a puzzle to see additional concept art and screens.\nWarframe has long been one of the most successful free-to-play games out there, almost coming on a decade since release.

          "description": "Whether it's because of its gorgeous visuals, deeply disturbing sci-fi monstrosities, or the return of Glen Schofield, The Callisto Protocol has become one of the most anticipated games of 2022. But where did this new twisted tale come from? Join us as we sit down with the horror master himself to discuss the origins of developer Striking Distance Studios' first game and show off some brand new gameplay as well!\n\n\nMarcus Stewart and Alex Stadnik are here to grill Glen on the title's origins. A few years after his departure from Activision, the CEO, and founder of Striking Distance Studios found himself in the desert, painting and trying to figure out what the next step in his career would be. That led him to Callisto and his brand new studio. But how long did it take him to form the story structure? Did he always know how the game would end? You'll just have to watch the video to find out.\nOn top of the Callisto origin story, we're also showing off some brand new gameplay. Protagonist Jacob Lee traverses the harrowing hallways of Jupiter's dead moon, fending off the terrifying Biophage at every step. We also get a fresh look at the satisfying and devastating shotgun and how it tears through those who would do you harm.\nIf you want to learn more about The Callisto Protocol ahead of its December 2 release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, be sure to head over to our exclusive cover hub below, where you'll find our preview impressions, the GI cover reveal, and more looks at the game. If that's not enough, you can head over to our Rapid-Fire interview with Glen where he quickly details more about the game, his horror influences, and comments on a particular fan theory.

The studio describes the untitled project as a single-player “immersive action horror game,” and it’s being made for PC, console, and VR. The game's website states that it's developed using Unreal Engine 5 and has an original story that takes place between Alien and Aliens \"where a battle hardened veteran has a vendetta against the Xenomorphs.\"\nThere’s no trailer or screenshots, but Survios says we’ll learn more about the game on July 21 during San Diego Comic-Con at the “Alien: Expanding a Dark and Frightening Universe” panel.\nThis project is unrelated to Aliens: Dark Descent, the Aliens tactical shooter, announced during Summer Game Fest last month. Survios is hiring for positions on the title, suggesting it’s still very early in development. As such, it has no release window, but hopefully, we’ll get a better idea of what it entails during Comic-Con.",

          "description": "Sony is rolling out its first-ever PlayStation-focused loyalty program called PlayStation Stars. In a blog post by Grace Chen, vice president of network advertising, loyalty & licensed merchandise, she explains that PlayStation Stars is a free program that rewards points by completing “campaigns” and challenges while playing games. \nAccording to Chen, earning points may require you to “win tournaments, earn specific trophies, or even be the first player to platinum a blockbuster title in your local time zone.” PlayStation Stars will also have a “monthly check-in” campaign that players fulfill simply by playing a game. \nYou can redeem points on rewards that may include PSN wallet funds or select PS Store products. Users also subscribed to PlayStation Plus gain the added benefit of automatically earning loyalty points for making purchases.\nLoyalty points can also be spent on “digital collectibles.\" Examples described in the post are digital figurines of game characters or old PlayStation devices. These collectibles will evidently come in various rarities, with Chen stating players will always have “ultra rare” collectibles to chase. \nThese collectibles may sound like NFTs, but they’re not. As Chen adamantly explains in a Washington Post interview, these digital items can’t be traded or sold and PlayStation Stars does not utilize blockchain technology in any way.  \n“It’s definitely not NFTs. Definitely not” says Chen.\nPlayStation Stars will gradually roll out across different regions sometime later this year. What do you think of this new loyalty program? Let us know in the comments!",

The purchased studio will focus on developing visual content for Nintendo's various IPs. \nAccording to Eurogamer, it's unusual for Nintendo to acquire companies despite its recent SRD and Next-Level Games deals. Moreover, Nintendo Pictures' – Dynamo was a production company behind several animated Pikmin shorts – work will be separate from Illumination, the animation studio behind the upcoming Super Mario Bros. Movie. Official documentation of the purchase states: \n\"Nintendo has decided to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares (excluding treasury shares) of Dynamo Pictures and make it a wholly owned subsidiary to strengthen the planning and production structure of visual content in the Nintendo group. The Acquisition is expected to close on October 3, 2022…[and] will have only a minor effect on Nintendo's results for this fiscal year.\"\nWhat animated Nintendo projects are you looking forward to?

Players can even climb up structures to face off on rooftops and leap between buildings. Rumbleverse supports cross-play and cross-progression between consoles and PC. \n\n\nRumbleverse launches on August 11 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via The Epic Games Store.
