However, in recent months, it seems that Nintendo has been preparing to bring the lawsuit stateside, with a handful of applications now appearing in the US Patent Office.\nAs reported by Games Fray, Nintendo has had three patent applications approved in the US in recent months — no. 12179111 in December 2024, 12194382 in January, and 12220638 earlier this week on 11th February. While the middle of the three doesn't appear to be all that relevant to the Palworld case (it was filed in 2022 and is all about exchanging items with other players), the remaining two were filed after Palworld's launch and specifically detail creature-catching mechanics — the specifics of which appear to be integral to the lawsuit in Japan.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

We've all played it, and we all have mildly different opinions on it - the stuff that thrilling conversations are made of.

But yes, I did get stuck on an early main quest that required me to use ice magic to create frozen platforms for crossing water, an otherwise neat little systems thingy that had not been communicated or hinted at before that point, but was communicated and hinted at during the following main quest.\nOtherwise, I’m having an okayish time? It doesn’t have the Skyrim-tier expansiveness I always hope for with these kinds of games, but its world is a pretty one, and it’s got some quality close-quarters mageing.\nNic: Look. I feel passionately about those crates. There are two types of crates. You can only smash the crates that have the special 'smash me' icon on them. I don't want a crate to \"come hither\" me. Takes all the fun out of the petty vandalism.\nIt's funny though because those two qualities you mention, James - the world and magic - are the same ones I thought were Avowed's strongest elements.

          "description": "Avowed is almost good, but there's something so resigned and workmanlike to its quest design and storytelling that it often feels like dog-eared chorelist of Obsidian must-haves, ticked off so aimlessly that the result is a bit like having an RPG described to you by someone late for a bus.\nAnd that should be that, really. I'd run through all the ways Obsidian's latest didn't quite do it for me, most of you would go play it anyway because it's on Games Pass, and we'd all go back to patiently waiting for the sun to explode.\nBut, god, what a devastatingly gorgeous open-zoned world this is. What a triumphantly weird, sprawling playground of fantasy naturalia. What a treat it is to just climb all over, its design ethos captured in the first magical ring I found offering a 15% buff to parkour speed.\nIgnore two thirds of the weapons and just roll a wizard to witness the stodgy melee combat of other classes give way to crackling, cackling spell-slinging. There is such a gulf of quality here it's like playing two different games. I spent 27 hours having a meh ol' time until a reinstallation of Nvidia's loathsome app deleted 200 some screenshots and I had to restart. Why not play a wizard? I thought. Why not indeed. Suddenly, I'm frying whole families of lizards at once with chain lightning and grinning like Palpatine in a pet shop.\n \nRead more",

He appeared on the podcast with former EA CEO Bing Gordon (thanks, Gamespot), to talk about both their company histories.\nKotick's statements reference widely reported incidents alleging a company culture of harassment, intimidation, and pay inequity around the time - coinciding with a lawsuit against the company - and the petition referred to appears to be this one to remove him as CEO, which attracted over a thousand signatures.\nThat petition followed a report by the Wall Street Journal (paywalled) that highlighted several alleged incidents of harassment by Activision staff, alongside reports that Kotick was aware of these allegations but did not inform the company's board of directors, and intervened to prevent the firing of an alleged harasser. It wasn't just Activision workers who found these claims alarming: a group of company shareholders called for Kotick's resignation soon after. Kotick denied any wrongdoing.\nRead more",

Yet beyond the sparkling glamour of marketing slides, however, path tracing remains exceptionally niche: nearly six years since Quake II RTX served as the tech’s de facto gaming debut, you can still count the number of compatible games on your fingers. Compare and contrast with the dozens upon dozens of games that have embraced ray tracing, path tracing’s less demanding nephew, and you’ll likely start wondering why more game devs don’t go for it.\nWe’re not here to answer that, though. This is Should You Bother With, here to investigate whether you should start using path traced effects to give your games – some of them, anyway – the full maxed-out-visuals treatment.

There’s also a standalone benchmark tool that you can download from the game’s Steam page, so you can see for yourself how the beast-biffing RPG will run on your hardware.\nIn theory, these are great developments. Lower requirements mean a more widely accessible game, and the benchmark tool – which covers a good six minutes of combined cinematics and simulated free roaming – brings reassurance and accountability to this otherwise hype-reliant prerelease period. Sadly, there are two problems. One, the benchmark confirms outright that Monster Hunter Wilds will run like stagnant goulash on low-end PCs, and two, it does so to the extent that I’m not sure that the revised minimum specs are even reliable.\nRead more",

          "description": "Sci-fi battle royale Apex Legends is due a \"meaningful update\" , according to the CEO of Electronic Arts, something he's called \"Apex 2.0\". To a normal person, adding a 2 to the end of your game's name is the sign of a sequel. But as the attendant decimal and zero suggest, it's not clear if that's exactly what he means. It could mean a revamp with new features, or some other new direction for the existing game. His later words do make it sound more like this is what EA have in mind. Or at least what they're prepared to tell folks in a financial report.\nRead more",

This ends the fight immediately. Sometimes I resort to this low move out of frustration, when a dull fight has dragged on for too long. Sometimes I resort to it out of panic, because I’ve accidentally set fire to every hard surface within ten feet, or frozen myself to a wall. Often it’s just for the pleasure of it. \r\n\nIn Eternal Strands, Yellow Brick Games’ debut title, you play the leader of a \"weaver band\", a crew of freelance magicians, in a world where something extremely bad happened to magic. Some years ago, the Enclave, a city state acting as the isolationist heart of the world’s magic, exploded in a kind of power surge - one part tsunami, one part blown fuse - and just as quickly sealed itself off from the world outside. Somehow managing to breach the wall, your band finds themselves the first people to set foot inside the ruined capital since the calamity and sets about uncovering the mystery of what exactly went wrong. \r\n\n \nRead more",

She greets him like a nobleman. I have Henry push back. He's a blacksmith's son. He might have some blue blood care of his biological father, but he grew up in the soot and clamour of the forge. The girl nervously insists, however: Henry must be from the upper crust, or he wouldn't have been welcomed and feasted by the lord of the estate. He wouldn't be lying in his very own chamber with its very own hole for shitting in - and in any case, it's more than her job's worth to treat him otherwise. In a timid, not quite spiteful show of reverse class policing, she refuses to end the dialogue until she's dismissed in a manner befitting her station.\n Read more",

It is, in fact, a rather nifty collection of upscaling improvements that can help out older graphics cards as readily as the very newest, while building on DLSS 3’s frame generation tool with Multi Frame Generation (MFG) to send visual smoothness skyrocketing. If you care even the slightest iota for how your PC performs in modern games, DLSS 4 demands your attention.\nHere, then, I’ll break down DLSS 4’s various tricks and components, looking at how they really affect performance – and whether it’s worth upgrading your rig to maximise compatibility with it.\nRead more",

Well, part of a poem. Both to free up room on the disc and perhaps, to edit out \"the vast sorrows and all the vexations\" of the second half, only the first two stanzas appear. The recording in fact ends halfway through a line, which conjures up an intriguing problem for the listener, inasmuch as the thwarted rhyme scheme reveals that the piece is incomplete. A poetically-minded alien might be tempted to fill in the gap. A fancier alien who took a module in postmodernism might hail the poetics of the fragment. A resolutely practical alien who thinks poetry is for losers might read the whole thing, instead, as a set of incoherent navigational prompts, made up of loose prepositions - au-dessus, au-dessus, par delà, par delà.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Mandragora: Whispers Of The Witch Tree is a 2.5D Soulsvania from Primal Game Studio, in which you electrify, bisect or incinerate handsome, ravening night creatures in a world of heaped skulls and burning spires. Yes, I'm well aware that \"2.5D\" and \"Soulsvania\" are nonsense words, woven by pestilent market forces. Samuel Johnson is turning in his grave, I expect. He has risen from his grave and equipped himself with an ironbound dictionary and is even now making his way through the layers of the English language, hellbent on slaughtering every 'vania yet coined.\nBut never mind Samuel. Oversized rodents and spiders aside, Mandragora is notable for being written by Brian Mitsoda, writer of the original Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines and the former narrative lead for its sequel at Hardsuit Labs, which lives on in the hands of The Chinese Room. Primal have just announced a release date - 17th April. Here's a trailer.\n Read more",

It's a crunchy, dicey machine of vibrant world-building that sometimes forgets itself in wandering prose. A compelling universe to sail through, with more habitats and hovels than its predecessor, more stations and stellar gateways. It can't - for me - escape the dense gravity of the first game's compact storytelling and novel character building, no matter how often it funnels you from one space caper to the next.

The closest it got to addressing the facts of what happened to an unspecified number of workers is the phrase: \"we don’t require support from the full studio.\" \nIt's one of the most disingenuous announcements of job cuts in a recent and plentiful history of job cuts. A weirdly impressive feat from BioWare, considering the last two or three years have seen some spectacular verbal gymnastics from games companies when it comes to shitcanning people.

          "description": "Mere hours before it’s January 30th release – wait, that’s today! – Sony have finally spilled the beans on system requirements for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, as well as the eye-blistering, GPU-rending special features that more powerful rigs can support. Happily, all these ray tracing and frame generation accoutrements seemingly won’t preclude Spidey 2 from working on older, slower PCs as well, as the minimum specs are surprisingly reasonable.\nGranted, they’re only rated for 30fps at a lowly 720p, and you’ll still need to find a honking 140GB of SSD space, but the basic GPU and CPU requirements aren’t too lofty at all. The likes of an RTX 3060 for 60fps/1080p are quite reasonable as well, though you’re staring down the barrel of Nvidia’s pricey RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 cards for high-rez ray tracing.\nRead more",

It's been eight months since PlayStation provoked mass annoyance among PC players by making a PSN account mandatory to play Helldivers 2, and later Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered. They soon walked back the decision for Helldivers 2 after a rough review-bombing but the company didn't seem to fully take the hint.

          "description": "If the latest rumors are to be believed, the Hristo Stoichkov Grassroot Greats Icon SBC is set to appear in EA FC 25 Ultimate Team.\n\n\nThe latest rumor has been shared on X by @FutSheriff, and he could well become the first icon to appear as a SBC. So far, EA Sports has neither confirmed nor denied the rumor, but here are my predictions about the upcoming challenge.\n\n\nEA FC 25 Hristo Stoichkov Grassroot Greats Icon SBC release date (predicted)\n\n\nThe Grassroot Greats promo goes live on February 14. The Hristo Stoichkov Grassroot Greats Icon SBC could be the promo opener, and it could appear as early as Friday. Typically, EA Sports has released Icon SBCs to begin a new promo, and the same trend might continue once again. If that's the case, the Stoichkov SBC could go live on February 14. \n\n\nAnother possible date of release for the Stoichkov SBC could be Sunday, February 16. Over the last few weeks, EA Sports has released special Icon challenges in Ultimate Team on Sundays. Hence, we could end up with the Stoichkov SBC within the next 72 hours as of writing this piece.\n\n\nEA FC 25 Hristo Stoichkov Grassroot Greats Icon SBC costs (expected)\n\n\nSo far, we have no information about what the official card might look like. His Base Icon card is valued at around 130,000 coins, but the new card will be far more expensive. If I have to guess, the SBC could cost around 500,000 coins worth of fodder.\n\n\nThe final cost will largely depend on how many tasks are there in the SBC. I don't expect it to be as expensive as the Ferland Mendy Grassroot Greats SBC. However, it shouldn't be cheap (given he is an icon and expected to have two playstyle+), so keep some of your high-rated fodder in store.\n\nThe post EA FC 25 Hristo Stoichkov Grassroot Greats Icon SBC leaked: Expected release date, cost, and more appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "During the main story quest Storm in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, events take place that result in your character having a pretty nasty debuff called Tortured. Here's how to remove the Tortured debuff and finally no longer be over encumbered.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHow to remove the Tortured debuff\n\n\nThe only way to remove the Tortured debuff is to continue through the Storm main story quest and completely escape Trosky Castle. Unfortunately, you need to rest in order to treat the Tortured debuff, but you cannot rest until you've completely escaped. Bandages and other aid items will not fix it, either.\n\n\nUntil you're able to rest and deal with the Tortured debuff, you'll have to deal with the negative effects of the debuff by fixing your encumbrance and potentially using consumables that buff your stats. It can be quite a pain navigating through the various Castle Trosky patrols both inside the castle and south of the castle at Apollonia while you have those Tortured debuff.\n\n\nWhat does the Tortured debuff do?\n\n\nThe Tortured debuff essentially lowers all of Henry's stats in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. The problem is, this often creates somewhat of a spiraling effect. Your Strength is lowered which lowers your carrying capacity, so then you're over encumbered, and it sort of snowballs out of control.\n\n\nYou get the Tortured debuff when being tortured during the Storm quest, but you can also mitigate and prevent it based on your answers. If you willingly give up your friends, you will not be Tortured and therefore will not receive the debuff. However, if you try to lie and fail the skill check, it will result in you being Tortured.\n\n\nFrom a narrative standpoint, I certainly understand wanting to lie. But if your skills aren't high enough to succeed in the checks, you may just want to tell the truth, otherwise it will make the future parts of the quest when escaping Trosky Castle much more difficult.\n\nThe post How to remove the Tortured debuff in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

If you have plans to complete it, I would prepare to keep at least 700,000 coins worth of fodder.

          "description": "There's no ideal time to promote a blocking system that by design restricts freedom and, for the vast majority of citizens, offers no tangible benefit. Yet, over the past 15 years or so, the major Hollywood studios have convinced authorities in dozens of countries that blocking pirate sites benefits everyone. If the FADPA bill passes, the MPA's export-only site-blocking system will be reimported to the U.S. at close to maximum strength, straight off the bat.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

          "description": "God of Thunder, the Zelda-esque game, is now ready for public testing!\nPrepare yourself to take on the role of Thor, the god of thunder, as he battles his way through the three part game, facing enemies and challenging environmental puzzles, all to finally face down challenging end bosses, culminating in Loki himself.\nThe implementation in ScummVM is slightly different from the original, in that whilst it has a high score table like the original, you don't have to go through the steps of creating an account and being limited to only a single savegame. Also, unfortunately, the game uses a special music format that will need to be implemented from scratch by someone with experience. So for now, no music playback will occur, though in-game sound effects play back fine.\nTo participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. The game itself is freeware, and can be downloaded from the Adept Software website. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.And please take some screenshots along the way.\nHave you the skill to defeat Loki, or will you be defeated by the cunning enemies, or be stymied figuring out the puzzles. Play, and find out.\n>",
