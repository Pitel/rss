          "description": "My selection box isn't really a selection box. It's a tray of barely-nibbled leftovers, hastily lifted from my Steam backlog. One of the disadvantages of being news editor, you see, is that I have  developed a goldfish-grade attention span. In my hectic pursuit of the next scoop, or the next Elden Ring update changelog, I snatch and cast aside game demos like a pickpocket speedrunning the checkout line at Harvey Nichols. I'm dimly aware that some of these cast-aside games are Very Good. A few might even deserve to be played for longer than 30 minutes. I feel immensely guilty about that. Perhaps a little... existential, too. I have measured out my life in tutorial levels. \r\n\n\r\nSo! Rather than digging out three of the games I've actually completed this year, such as The Crush House, Death Of A Wish and Mask Quest, I'm going to gamble on recommending a few I've barely scratched, but which sure feel excellent and have attracted a positive critical consensus. If I am false in this assessment, may Horace the Endless Bear bite my head off for my impudence. Let's begin.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Between rising desktop component prices and ever-ballooning electricity bills, it would make sense that a smaller, cheaper system would take on a new appeal, and the success of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally show that convenience still trumps out-and-out performance for a lot of PC players. There have even been hints that Valve are resurrecting their Steam Machine mini PC concept, years after a flopping first attempt. Should you be interested?\nRead more",

My weakest skeletons, sensing their death coming, explode into fire and shards. My strongest skeletons fight so hard and with such alacrity that upon dying, they drag their spirits together and keep fighting as ghosts for a while. Foul little bone scorpions skitter around on fans of legs made from human hands. Somewhere in the middle, almost invisible among the noise, is the character I am actually playing: Path of Exile 2’s mean-spirited, callous, and gleefully enjoyable Witch.\nThis is a review in progress. It has to be. Even in its incomplete early access period, Path of Exile 2 is a great sprawling mass of a game. Three meaty acts of a planned six act campaign are followed by a trickier return tour through them, before the absurd endgame kicks into gear and the real work begins. If I came to you having played everything on offer I would be wild-haired, bloodshot-eyed and possessing perfect, incomprehensible knowledge. Let’s compromise: I have toured the dark caverns and the antediluvian crypts. I have been killed by various accumulated nasties. I’ve had a great time.\nRead more",

Some of the reaction is online toddlers waxing wroth about a video game having a (somewhat older!!!) woman as lead character, and especially, shock, a video game in a series that has hitherto starred a man. And some of it is people commenting more thoughtfully on whether Ciri genuinely makes for a suitable Witcher protagonist, given that she isn't the product of the typical Witcher genetic modification regime (which is heavily tailored towards men), and given that, without spoiling too much, she has gifts that make crumbly old Geralt's sword-and-sorcery skillset look rather paltry. \r\n\n\nSpeaking to Eurogamer this week, game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber responded to a few of these comments, and also shared a little about Ciri's situation at the start of the game.\r\n \nRead more",

After creating many characters, and dying and dying and dying again, I understand why it grips the brain with such fierce glee. It is a machine of grand imagination and adventuresome comedy.

          "description": "Fists up, a big fighting game mod is due out this weekend. Marvel vs Capcom Infinite came out in 2017 and got some flak for its plastic figurine art style. But this year a modder began work on an overhaul that would grant the game pretty cel-shaded visuals. Since then the modding team has grown to 40 people and the scope of the mod's features has ballooned. It's now going to include new moves, stages, costumes, and a chaotic-looking 2v2 multiplayer tag team mode. All good news for biff 'em up sickos, as the mod is due to release on Friday. \nRead more",

In October of this year, we got a look at some icky celestial faction and zero in the way of actual gameplay. And now? Now we finally get a look at how you do things.

          "description": "A master thief creeps over cobbles in an early modern metropolis that splits the difference between Edinburgh, Glasgow and Liverpool. Lit by gaslamps that can’t quite dispel the industrial haze, they pass for a civilian - a rough one, admittedly, but not shady enough to cause an itch in the swordarm of any passing guard.\nUntil, that is, they take to the thieves’ highway - following the trajectory of their grappling hook upward to the rooftops, from which they can see the shape of the city, and the moon beyond. Up here, it’s a parallel world - the trees on street level answered by chimney stacks, and the distant hills echoed by the rise and fall of steep gables. “We’re super proud of these rooftops,” says Greg LoPiccolo. “It’s an amazing landscape that we put a lot of thought and effort into, and it’s a lot of fun to traverse.”\nBack in 1998, LoPiccolo was the game director who saw Thief: The Dark Project to completion. Today - after an 18 year detour to Harmonix to lead projects like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, among other adventures - he’s the game director of Thick as Thieves. “It really is an opportunity to do something unique and cool and new, on the shoulders of this stuff that is now well-respected,” he says. “Thief has some legs, right? People still talk about it to some degree.”\nRead more",

Fights are like if you took a MOBA and forced both teams to bash heads constantly. Success lies in picking off Spider-Man or Squirrel Girl or Marcus Fenix so as they wait to respawn, you hop on the big area that needs capturing. Or you push the cart while tanky Hulk absorbs bullets with his biceps and John Marvel snipes from afar.\nThe more I played Rivals, though, the more it hit me that it's specifically a messier, more complex Overwatch. A hero shooter with a surprising amount of polish and charm, sure, but also one that slides off my brain like water off Birdman's back. I understand why it's supremely popular at the moment and yet, I really don't.\nRead more",

          "description": "In more ways than one, today’s Total War: Warhammer 3 expansion marks a milestone for game director Rich Aldridge and his team at Creative Assembly. Omens Of Destruction’s three headline legendary lords each bring new campaigns and units for their respective factions, but it’s the fourth lord - a Khorne champion free to all players - that I imagine Aldridge will end up remembering the most fondly.\nWhen Total War: Warhammer released back in 2016, it shipped with eight legendary lords - famous characters from Games Workshop’s fantasy setting that here act as faction leaders. The number grew steadily and, in terms of announcement order at least, today’s addition of Arbaal The Undefeated marks the series’ 100th. That's a hundred campaigns, a hundred joint efforts of game design, animation, art, writing and voice work.\nAldridge has never been shy about the team’s ambition for the series to eventually offer up each unit from every Fantasy Battle 6th edition army book (\"The goal is to do everything, right?\"). But ambition is one thing, and considering the fraught conditions at Creative Assembly and parent company Sega over the past few years, it’s not just the addition of the 100th lord that feels like something to celebrate. It’s taken time, effort, and a siesmic shift in update frequency, but Total War: Warhammer III is in the best place it's ever been.\nRead more",

All while a hungry black hole lingers nearby, eager to consume everything you have created. There's an explanatory video below.\r\n\n \nRead more",

No, I'm not going to share pictures. You'll have to google that filth yourself.\r\n\n\r\nBut perhaps you are a sophisticated soul who has no time for such salacious nonsense.

          "description": "The latest Blox Fruits update introduces candies that you can grind and get, and they can be extremely useful for your adventure on the new island.\n\n\nNaturally, you'll want to earn as many candies as possible and do so efficiently. Doing so is the first part of getting this specific resource, which can then be traded for exclusive rewards. Let's take a look at how to earn a candy in Blox Fruits' latest update.\n\n\nBest way to get candies in Blox Fruits (Christmas Update 2024)\n\n\nEarning a candy is pretty simple once you know what to do. You'll have to eliminate NPCs who have [ELF] on them. These enemies are guaranteed to drop candies when eliminated, and it's a consistent method of getting this resource.\n\n\nIdentifying these enemies is easy as you'll have to notice their names. They will have [ELF] written ahead of their names and levels. These enemies also spawn randomly, and hence, you'll be relying a bit on your luck to find them. While killing them, you'll have to keep one important point in mind.\n\n\nAny enemy with the [ELF] prefix will drop candies, but their level difference must not be less than 100 from yours. Any enemy having a level difference of over 100 will not be of the required type, which makes things slightly challenging. However, you can still farm a lot at locations where the difficulty matches your level, and you can encounter a lot of NPCs in quick time.\n\n\nHow to use candies in Blox Fruits (Christmas Update 2024)\n\n\n\n\nOnce you find the candies, go to a Christmas Island to trade them. There are three islands found in the Sea of Treats areas Sea 1, Sea 2, and Sea 3. After you reach the island, interact with Santa Claws at the dock. You can find some cool items like the Santa Hat, Elf Hat, or a Sleigh. You can also talk with the Greedy Elf to exchange your candies for Fragments.\n\n\nIf you aren't happy with what's being offered, the Magic Elf offers an EXP multiplier that works for a limited time.\n\nThe post How to get more candies in Blox Fruits (Christmas Update 2024) appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Exalted Orbs is one of the many valuable items you can find in Path of Exile 2, but it's pretty difficult to get it if you're just getting started with the game.\n\n\nThe drop rate of Exalted Orbs is pretty low, and it's almost non-existent until you have reached the endgame. They are extremely useful if you want to improve your loadout with various affixes. You can also trade these valuable resources to other players, and let's look at how you can farm them consistently.\n\n\nBest ways to farm Exalted Orbs in Path of Exile 2\n\n\nYou can get an Exalted Orb in Path of Exile 2 by killing enemies, but its drop rate is remarkably low. To improve your odds, you can try clearing the Act bosses while clearing the main content. Still, at the default difficulty, you won't have much luck.\n\n\nHowever, once you clear all three Acts on the default difficulty, you can play on Cruel. The Golden Beetle boss in Act 2's The Lost City region used to be a great source of Exalted Orbs, but GGG has nerfed the spawn rate.\n\n\nNow, you'll want to look for areas that spawn many mobs and enemies in a small area. Maps with modifiers that raise the spawn rate of the number of enemies at a decent difficulty will also increase the odds in your favor. Make sure to look out for chests and barrels.\n\n\n\n\nYou can also get Exalted Orbs by trading on the official website, using your lower-tier currencies based on their demand in the market. Try to gather them when their market prices are low and use them for trade when their value goes up. Any high-value item specific to the meta builds will usually sell well on the market.\n\n\nIt will be interesting to find out when Exalted Shards are added to the game and how many of those will be required to create an orb. So far, this feature is yet to be added to the early access build, but it will be a great addition in the future.\n\nThe post How to get Exalted Orbs in Path of Exile 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.

A je důležité říct si něco o tom, o jakou podívanou vlastně jde a v čem přesně spočívá ten \"remaster\".\nU zrodu tohoto počinu stálo elektronické hudební duo Daft Punk, které v roce 2001 vydalo své album \"Discovery\". K písničkám z alba vyšly animované videoklipy, které produkoval Leidži Macumoto, což byl kultovní japonský výtvarník (zemřel loni), který měl na svém kontě mnoho animovaných seriálů, především ze 70. - 80. let (nejslavnější z nich byl asi \"Space Battleship Yamato\"). Daft Punk ho oslovili proto, že na jeho seriálech vyrůstali, takže výsledné dílo, včetně \"jednodušší\" retro animace a naivní zápletky zcela záměrně připomíná staré japonské televizní počiny (n…",

Přestože mám muzikály rád, téměř vůbec se u mě nedostavil jakýkoliv pocit dojetí nebo jiná silná emoce a z písniček si téměř nic nepamatuji.
