Much of the game's success could be attributed to the team of passionate and talented fans (led by Christian Whitehead) that came together to develop it, but rather than coast on their success by producing the Sonic Mania 2 that many fans expected, this team instead rebranded themselves as a boutique studio called Evening Star and set out to launch their own IP with a new 3D platformer called Penny’s Big Breakaway.\nThough the influence of the Blue Blur is immediately apparent in Penny's Big Breakaway's design, Evening Star's debut adventure very much feels like it asserts its own identity. Some minor performance quirks aside, this is a spectacular, creative, unique, and deeply enjoyable new entry in the 3D platforming genre that no fan will want to miss.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Concessions stand.\nWhile the demise of physical media has seemed like an inevitability for many years now, boutique publishers are helping to keep a passionate base of physical-only fans with a stocked game library. The scenario right now isn't ideal, with eShop releases often only getting a physical version months later (once a publisher has gauged interest and calculated an approach that isn't going to leave them lumbered with thousands of costly Switch carts in the storeroom) or with orders only open in a limited window.\nDecade-old trends have suggested a movement away from physical from the big players — why create a secondhand market if you can limit resales and maximise your own profits? — although at present Nintendo seems content with the status quo. Microsoft is occupied with Game Pass and Sony's number of first-party releases pales in comparison to Nintendo, quantity-wise, so right now it's easy to imagine things just staying the same for the next generation — all the big games will still be available in physical form, if that's how you want them.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Rebels' gun.\nFollowing its stellar remaster work on the likes of Quake, Quake II, and the Turok series, Nightdive Studios is back with another glimpse into the world of retro first-person shooters. This time, we’re heading into the Star Wars universe with Star Wars: Dark Forces Remaster, an intriguing game in more ways than one. On the one hand, it offers a look at one of the many, many so-called ‘Doom clones’ that emerged after the immense success of id Software’s seminal shooter, and on the other, it represents an era of the Star Wars expanded universe that, in the wider context of the franchise canon, doesn’t exist anymore.\nTo call 1995's Dark Forces a mere clone of Doom, however, would be to do it a disservice. Yes, the game owes Doom a debt of gratitude, but given LucasArts’ prowess in the adventure genre, the developers were able to elevate Dark Forces to new heights, incorporating story elements via cutscenes and mission briefs, while ensuring that the gameplay wasn’t simply a case of ‘go here, shoot that’. It features actual objectives which, at the time, were a refreshing change of pace and allowed for more player agency. You weren’t simply infiltrating an Imperial stronghold for the fun of it; you were doing it to further the rebellion’s cause. For the galaxy, for goodness' sake.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

He and his fellow co-founder Ben Driscoll had just spent a week playing Daniel Mullins' mysterious roguelike deckbuilder Inscryption at the end of October 2021, but the combination of a bad storm and a power outage ended up forcing Guerra to decamp from his home in Massachusetts and stay with some family until it all blew over. \"I got back late on Halloween, just in time to put out a bowl of candy for some kids, and then the next morning we started Cobalt Core,\" he tells me.\nThe pair had been working on a range of different prototypes in the months leading up to this lightbulb moment. As development on their debut game, the spaceship building puzzler Sunshine Heavy Industries, began winding down, \"we were throwing all kinds of stuff at the wall,\" he says, including games in 3D, a platformer, with Driscoll revealing they even had \"a Terraria-like one for a couple of weeks\" with a grid-based world that characters bounced around in. But it was playing Inscryption that brought everything to a head. Both had spent hundreds of hours with Slay The Spire, but \"Inscryption proved to us that there was still a lot of space to explore in the genre,\" says Guerra. And with increasing calls from Sunshine Heavy Industries players begging them to let them fly the ships they were creating in its shipyard sandbox, \"you can kind of see how that went from A to B\".\nRead more",

          "description": "In Shakespeare's Anthony And Cleopatra, said famous woman says \"Give to a gracious message an host of tongues, but let ill tidings tell themselves when they be felt.\" I.e., when you have good news you can go round the houses, but if you have bad news - like sending an all-hands email to the staff at EA to let them know that, less than a year after the last round of layoffs, a further 5% of them are getting booted - then you should just come out and say it as quickly and simply as possible.\nThis is, apparently, not a sentiment ever internalised by Andrew Wilson, EA's CEO. Yesterday, when he announced to everyone at EA that a bunch of them were losing their jobs (again), he first spent three paragraphs talking about how EA is doing great, leading the industry, getting increasing engagement from fans, optimising their global footprint and sunsetting games oh yep, there it is, that's the \"you're about to be unemployed\" language right there. The company is moving away from \"the development of future licensed IP\" and toward \"our owned IP, sports, and massive online communities\". Therefore: 670 ish devs (by Eurogamer's count) must go.\nRead more",

Yet, here we are, three years and more than a dozen developer vlogs since TallBoys' surreal runaway sim first captured everyone's attention (including one state-owned Russian news channel). If not for its Kafkaesque premise, which pits players against a ten-story tall looming policeman in a quest to escape a small town, then definitely because of the game’s ambitious voice recognition feature that promised real-time conversation instead of pre-written dialogue.\nRead more",

I cannot remember for the life of me which level(s) it contained. My only surviving memory of it is having quite a good time blasting Stormtroopers and the chaps in black with the swoopy, knock-off Vader helmets, but also getting terribly lost and not really knowing what the heck I was meant to be doing. Now, playing Nightdive Studio's Star Wars: Dark Forces Remaster as an adult probably close to three decades later, both these feelings have come roaring back, as this is very much a Star Wars FPS in the vein of Doom and other early 90s shooters (thumbs up). But it's one that leans so hard into its maze-like level design that it can regularly feel like a little bit of a tough hang in the cold hard light of 2024 (thumbs down).\nCrucially, though, not to the point where it's best left consigned to the history books. This is still an enjoyable and worthwhile artefact in Star Wars' PC gaming history, and if your eyes (and general patience levels) can't quite stomach the 'Classic' and still available 1995 original, then this remaster is a pin-sharp glow-up for modern hardware.\nRead more",

I'm worried that so much cost has been sunk, team members changed and redrafting did that it'll end up kind of a mess. But that's the pessimism talking.

          "description": "“Ever since the very first Yakuza on PS2, the Like A Dragon series has always tried to capture the cultural zeitgeist of Japan, reflecting and satirising whatever’s trending around when the game comes out. This means that the way people speak in Like A Dragon is constantly evolving to match the times,” says Dan Sunstrum, senior translator at Ryu Ga Gotoku’s localisation team. Keeping things current is, says Sunstrum, “a challenge in some ways but also means we’re justified in using modern English slang to match, whereas such modernisms might feel out of place in a game set in a completely fictional world.”\nSunstrum uses an example from the studio’s latest, RPS Bestest Best winning RPG Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, where permed protagonist Ichiban Kasuga meets a dating app designer. “The app’s creator goes on a mini-rant about ungrateful, entitled users, complaining how when anything goes wrong they’re quick to demand wabi-ishi,” slang for free premium currency. “This would have been a tricky word to localise, but it was made easy by the fact that fans of gacha games had already done it for us: they refer to them as ‘apologems’, and that’s what we ended up using in the game.”\nRead more",

In a recent interview, the developer claims that part of why it's so damn successful is because they've barely played other roguelikelike deckbuilders so it's free to do its own thing outside genre conventions.

Most such games start you off on the periphery of the world, out in the sleepy and/or brutish hamlets of FirstActShire, Chosen One County, and send you on a loose quest towards the cosmopolitan centre, where you'll typically learn about the ultimate villain of the piece, gain access to the juiciest concentration of shops, crafting facilities and quest-givers, and glean some hint at the location of the endgame dungeon. Sometimes the quest takes days of playtime, as in Baldur's Gate 3. Sometimes it takes less than an hour, as in the original Destiny. It's a common-enough device that when an RPG starts you off in the Big City, like Dragon Age 2, or creatively \"provincialises\" the Big City, like Roadwarden, I feel slightly unnerved. \r\n\n \nRead more",

I sternly and sorrowfully turned my back on such hit releases as Shadow of the Colossus, Far Cry and yes, even, that PC gaming essential Half-Life 2, so as to spend 11-hour days boning up on Aeschylus and Samuel Johnson. Then, two weeks before my final exams, I somehow went out and bought Ensemble's Age Of Mythology.\nI'm not sure why - blame the devil on my shoulder, I guess. It wasn't even a new release at that point. I managed to get good marks in the exams despite several nights of binge-playing, but what direction, in general, would my life have taken if I hadn't bought Age Of Mythology at such a fateful hour? Better or worse? Could I have been some kind of billionaire don with a Pulitzer by now, if it weren't for Age Of Mythology? These things keep me awake at night. Anyway, here's a little more info about the forthcoming reboot Age of Mythology: Retold, which broadly aims to turn this wrinkled titan of the strategy genre into a proper modern esport.\n Read more",

          "description": "Lil Guardsman is a game that wears its heart on its sleeve. In a victory for normative determinism, this is a fantasy adventure about a small girl named Lil who somehow becomes the first (and seemingly only) line of defence at a city’s border patrol as a guardsman. At various points, both Lil and those around her frequently call attention to the fact that, yes, you are merely a 12-year-old child who is massively underqualified for this task, and that if you’re going to continue filling in for your good for nothing father who’s down the pub gambling on the latest ball game, then really, what do your superiors expect? It’s very self-aware in that sense, and occasionally verges on breaking the fourth wall. This alone will probably be a fairly good indicator of whether you’ll gel with Lil Guardsman’s sense of humour or not, but for the most part, this is a sweet and jovial narrative adventure whose characterful animation and charming voice cast help bring this oddball tale of fate and consequence to life.\nIt's also not shy about where it’s taken its main source of inspiration from either. This is fantasy Papers, Please through and though, albeit one that’s more about interrogating and probing would-be citygoers for information than checking documents and spotting inconsistencies. During the day you’ll be working your post, dealing with the increasingly large, but fixed queues of fantasy species all trying to enter the city gate to go about their business. When you're off the clock, it's time to pick up the game's wider plotlines, with Lil able to travel around the city to set locations where she can chat with other townsfolk, sometimes partake in the odd mini-game or two, and visit the local shop before toddling off to bed. It’s admittedly quite a straightforward interpretation of Lucas Pope’s magnum opus, with star ratings denoting clear right and wrong answers for how you deal with each day’s horde, but you know what they say about first impressions. Good ones go a long way.\nRead more",

          "description": "I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting from Graven, but it still feels like it wasn't quite what I expected. That's both good and bad. It has the look of a 90s throwback FPS, the cool atmosphere and action RPG (barely RPG, really, restricted to which weapons you upgrade) combat of something from the 2000s like Rune or Dark Messiah, with a hint of a modern immersive sim. There is, I think, a better game to be made with those parts in a different arrangement. This one is only kinda good.\nRead more",

          "description": "This week's Nintendo Direct was stuffed full of games that will also be making their way to PC over the next few months, but the one I haven't been able to stop thinking about is the newly-announced Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure. It's the debut game from a team of indie devs that include Braid artist David Hellman, Carto writer Nick Suttner and Ethereal designer Nicolás Recabarren, and they've also partnered with composer Tomás Batista, who did the music for both Ethereal and Martian colony builder Per Aspera. It's a pretty stacked line-up as these things go, but it's Arranger's world of constantly shifting sliding tiles that's really piqued my curiosity.

The UI is cleaner and tighter, and I’ve had more space to explore (and enjoy) the mysterious nooks of its magic 'n' moustaches world. There’s potential here, but it’s very much the raw kind, especially when performance needs as much work as it does.\nBesides relying on upscalers like DLSS for truly smooth running, Nightingale currently has a serious stuttering problem, and bumping into an ugly graphical artefact or even a hard crash is worryingly common. I’ve pulled together an optimised settings guide (down below) so that you don’t need to drop the visual quality lower than is strictly necessary, but do keep in mind that this is early access with emphasis on the early.\nRead more",

The gaslamp fantasy survival game requires you be online even if you want to play by yourself, which dovetailed poorly with server issues at launch to frustrate folks. Inflexion say that early in development they needed to make a choice between focusing on co-op or offline first, and now think they made the wrong call.

          "description": "Satan has vanished, the throne of hell lies empty, and eight Archfiends are all jostling to be its chief seat warmer. It's a great setup for a role-playing strategy game, and the allure of plotting, scheming, backstabbing and shmoozing your way to victory remains as enticing today as it did when Solium Infernum first came to PC in 2009. At the time, it launched to relative obscurity, and was mostly kept alive by dedicated play-by-email multiplayer groups. It was through one of these groups that Armello developers League Of Geeks first came into contact with it, and now, years later, have taken on the task of remaking Solium Infernum for a modern audience.\nThe original Solium was, by all accounts, an intensely knotty and dense affair, impenetrable to newcomers, or at least to those who were unprepared (or unwilling) to study and absorb all the countless variations and statistics involved in creating your own unique Archfiend. It was a bit like creating a D&D character sheet, only about ten times more complicated, and whose strategic implications may or may not have made themselves apparent until it was far too late. You could biff yourself before you began, in other words, and League Of Geeks have made admirable attempts to tame and streamline this unruly hell beast, doing away with a lot of that initial fussiness. As is perhaps fitting for the theme here, there are unfortunately still a few pesky gremlins causing mayhem behind the scenes at time of writing (I'm pointing the finger at literal bug queen Beelzebub for this), but for the most part, there's good fun to be had in this new incarnation of Solium Infernum - and particularly if you have some willing friends who you soon hope to call enemies.\nRead more",

          "description": "As Helldivers 2 continues to be struggling with its own success, suffering wildly overloaded servers that make it sometimes tricky to even log in, a new patch today has added a feature to help alleviate the pressure. Having previously capped the number of players to 450,000, developers Arrowhead have now added an auto-kick to stop people hogging those precious slots while not playing. After 15 minutes, AFK players will now get booted. It's clearly not the big fix needed but hopefully fresh duct tape will help hold the co-op shooter together until more permanent solutions arrive.\nRead more",

Thankfully, the Flintlock train does seem to be kicking into a gear a bit more now that it's steaming toward its Summer 2024 release window, as yesterday developers A44 Games released a new gameplay teaser trailer for it, ahead of a wider reveal planned for next month. The trailer shows more of its melee and magical combat, though personally, I'm just glad to see that heroine Nor hasn't been neglecting her leg days, as we get to see some meaty and powerful kicks in there, too.

          "description": "Poncle has abruptly dropped a new update for Vampire Survivors with a trailer that includes some well-timed Final Fantasy references. Just a few. The Space54 update is available today.\n\n\nIs the update at all related to Final Fantasy? Hmmm, no. It doesn’t look like it. However, for some reason, the team decided to release a trailer alongside it that is a shot-for-shot remake of the 1997 Final Fantasy VII trailer. Well, as shot-for-shot as they can manage with Vampire Survivors.\n\n\n\n\nWhat? Well, according to the press release I received, an insides says, “Because we had the original trailer on a PlayStation demo disk and watched it on loop so now it’s scored into our brains. Plus the team is extremely hyped for Rebirth. What better way to celebrate than with a trailer of our own?”\n\n\nAs for the actual update, I don’t think you’re going to be seeing any buster swords. It looks to be more sci-fi-themed. This is what Poncle has highlighted for the Space54 update:\n\n\n7 New Achievements\n\n\n2 New Characters:\n\n\n\nBat Robbert – When falling below 20% health, he gains +16 MaxHP (max +400) and recovers 30% health. This ability recharges every time the character is fully healed.\n\n\nSpace Dude – Every few seconds fires all weapons regardless of their Cooldown. The cooldown of this ability is affected by the Cooldown stat.\n\n\n\nNew Weapons:\n\n\n\nPako Battiliar – May retaliate when losing health.\n\n\nPhas3r – Pew Pew! Generates thin damaging zones. High Amount scaling.\n\n\n\nNew Stage\n\n\n\nSpace54 – A cosmic trek through horrors and delights.\n\n\n\nNew Relic\n\n\n\nAllows to enable random level up choices.\n\n\n\nVampire Survivors is available on basically everything at this point. The Space54 update is free and will be arriving today.\n\nThe post Vampire Survivors announces new update with a Final Fantasy trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

According to GamesIndustry.biz, Electronic Arts announced today that it will be laying off approximately 5% of its workforce which equates to around 670 people. In a note sent out to EA staff, CEO Andrew Wilson indicated the move is part of the company \"moving away from development of future licensed IP that we do not believe will be successful in our changing industry.\"\n\n\nAnother sweeping layoff in our decimated industry\n\n\nThe moves are part of a larger restructuring plan at EA which includes the closing of some offices and sunsetting of several live games. According to GameIndustry.biz, major external IP games based on Black Panther and Iron Man remain in development.\n\n\nThis is the second time in the last year that EA has performed restructuring plans resulting in hundreds of layoffs after EA cut 6% of staff in March 2023.\n\n\nLiterally one day ago, Sony announced it was cutting almost 1,000 jobs by cutting its workforce by 8%.\n\n\nWe're not even a quarter of the way into 2024 and over 7,000 jobs have been lost in the games industry just these last two months. This is immediately after an equally brutal 2023 where over 10,000 jobs were lost.

While Half-Life: Alyx and the wide variety of mods and bonus materials from Valve are a good way to keep the general vibe of the franchise alive, ADACA accomplishes a similar job while still successfully eking out its own dedicated niche.

          "description": "After some time in development and testing, the Dragon Ball FighterZ rollback netcode update is here to Spirit Bomb the lag away. Those hoping to play some online matches without the delay-based netcode can start doing so, for certain platforms.\n\n\nThe Dragon Ball FighterZ rollback netcode patch will be available for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. However, devices like the PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch will still only feature a delay-based netcode mechanic. The Circle Party and Party Battle modes will also be limited to the delay-based netcode.\n\n\nRollback will go live for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on February 29, when those consoles' versions go live. It's also headed to PC at the same time.\n\n\nAs for what the update actually does, it seeks to fix input lag and visual stuttering for compatible online matches through rollback netcode, resulting in much smoother gameplay. Bandai Namco mentions that it \"feels closer to offline play\" due to its quicker response system. \n\n\nImage via Arc System Works\n\n\nUnlike consoles, PC will get the option to choose between the rollback or delay-based netcode, depending on the matchmaking performance. Save data transfers are available as well, for those who want to make the switch to a newer console and its netcode.\n\n\nMany online games have issued out rollback netcode updates in the past, to better the performance of online play. The system has been gradually adopted across fighting games as a preferable option for handling bouts over long distances, using predictive options rather than hitching the action. We've seen the likes of Samurai Shodown and Street Fighter 6 adopt rollback, to help with online lag. And now, Dragon Ball FighterZ has joined the rollback club.\n\n\nDragon Ball FighterZ unfortunately continues to not have cross-play functionality. But hopefully, rollback netcode will be a good move for keeping the online bouts of DBFZ going strong.\n\nThe post Dragon Ball FighterZ rollback netcode arrives this week appeared first on Destructoid.",

The studio has acquired full rights from publisher 505 Games, for roughly €17M.\n\n\nWhile Remedy Entertainment previously developed the game with 505 Games having publishing, distribution, and marketing rights over Control, this latest transaction converts this authority to Remedy, giving them full rights over Control, as well as the upcoming Control 2 and the multiplayer game currently under the codename Condor.\n\n\nAccording to the announcement, publishing agreements for all three games are \"immediately terminated by mutual agreement\", outside 505 Games continuing as Control's publisher until December 31, 2024. Publishing, distribution, marketing, and other rights are also completely reverted to Remedy \"with immediate effect.\" \n\n\nRemedy's announcement also reveals the maximum purchase price of this exchange to be approximately EUR 17 million, equaling the amount 505 Games paid for Condor and Control 2's development cycle thus far, plus a premium. Remedy will pay the purchase price over the next 12 months.\n\n\nIn doing this, Remedy Entertainment will \"be more directly in charge of marketing, distribution and other business-to-business deals\".

However, the Fortnite and Unreal studio has since responded to concerns that anyone has gained access to files, saying it's investigating but hasn't found any evidence so far.\n\n\nAccording to the Australian site Cyber Daily, a group calling itself the Mogilevich gang is claiming to have gotten hold of around 189GB of personal information from Epic. Some of the data said to have been stolen include “email, passwords, full name, payment information, source code and many other data.”\n\n\nThe group is asking someone who works for the company to \"buy the data.\" While no price has been mentioned, a deadline of March 4 was given, though there was no clue about what would happen if the demand for money wasn't met by this date.\n\n\n\n\nNo contact made to Epic\n\n\nIn a statement to Eurogamer a few hours ago (plus the above tweet), Epic Games has said it's moving fast to investigate these claims.\n\n\nHowever, Epic says there is \"zero evidence right now that the ransomware claims from Mogilevich are legitimate.\" The message goes on to say the studio began investigating \"within minutes\" of seeing the \"screenshot of a darkweb webpage in a Tweet from a third party.\"\n\n\nA recent post on Twitter from Editor-in-Chief of Bleeping Computer Lawrence Abrams says the group is looking for $15K for the allegedly hacked data.

          "description": "With the long awaited 1.6 update to Stardew Valley finally coming on March 19, fans have taken the opportunity to speculate about what’s to come, including what a little raccoon on the official image could mean. \n\n\nWay back in December 2020, update 1.5 brought players a long list of additions, including a new location in Ginger Island. As such, players are currently getting excited at the thought that Update 1.6 could add another new location, Prairie Island.\n\n\nIt’s worth noting before we go any further that this has not been confirmed by ConcernedApe and, at the moment, is just a fan theory.\n\n\nIs Prairie Island coming to Stardew Valley?\n\n\n\n\nOne Reddit post by u/Russ_Guss_Doodles highlights exactly why fans are speculating that Update 1.6 could see Stardew Valley players head to Prairie Island.\n\n\nPrairie Island is known to have an abundant population of raccoons, as shown in the \"Natural Wonders: Exploring Our Vibrant World\" film at the in-game Movie Theatre. Ginger Island was teased within the same movie and, again, was added in Update 1.5.\n\n\nBack in April 2023, ConcernedApe told fans that they were taking a break to work on 1.6, but that the update wouldn’t be as comprehensive as 1.5. However, the developer has also admitted that they’ve worked much harder than they originally anticipated on the upcoming patch, so it’s understandable that players are excited for what’s to come. \n\n\n\n\nWithin the comments on the above tweet, one user asked ConcernedApe about the possibility of a new island and while the developer didn’t outright answer the question, he did say that 1.6 would be more about “adding more to the old stuff”.\n\n\nFor now, we’ll just have to wait and see what that raccoon really means.\n\nThe post Stardew Valley fans think a little raccoon is hinting at something for Update 1.6 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The third installment (or fourth if you count Whistleblower as a separate entry) in the terrifyingly disturbing horror series leans more towards multiplayer, and version 1.0 is about to drop on y'all.\n\n\nRecent updates from the developer show that the next patch is almost here, and rolls out on March 5. This will take Outlast Trials out of Early Access. Along with this, the game will come with a brand-new map: the Toy Factory. There will also be new MK-Challenges, and more.\n\n\n\n\nAlso, with the 1.0 update, the game itself is going to be going up in price. This means you have until next Tuesday to get The Outlast Trials a bit cheaper. Oh, and it's also available to pre-order for consoles as well, so that's nice. Check out the PlayStation and Xbox stores for details.\n\n\nPushing the boundaries of taste\n\n\nEver since I played the first Outlast back in 2013, I've been intrigued by how far Red Barrels can take things. Horror has always been about scaring people or putting them in unsettling or unfamiliar locations. With this series, it goes that one step further by actually creating something disgusting.\n\n\nKnown for its shocking amounts of detailed gore, disturbing content, and sexual themes, the Outlast games have trodden where other survival horror franchises rarelu dare tread.\n\n\nI've yet to play Trials, but with version 1.0 around the corner, it might be time to re-enter Murkoff once more, because a perturbing amount of violence of psychopathy is evidently what's missing in my life.\n\nThe post Outlast Trials v1.0 releases next week, coming to consoles as well appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "I wasn't wrong when I said that the release of Nvidia's RTX Remix toolkit would see retro games be given a bit of a spin shine. In this latest example, a modder has taken the original Unreal and injected it with some path tracing and other visual tweaks.\n\n\nThe below video was spotted by DSO Gaming, and shows the 1998 Epic Games release has been given a bit of boost using RTX technology. We see the first level of the classic FPS, as the player shows off the much brighter and bolder colored lighting. Pew pew, indeed.\n\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that this is a work in progress, and it's still being tinkered with. As a result, you can see a couple of graphical glitches, particularly in the new \"shiny\" gun. The game was loaded into the Unreal Tournament engine.\n\n\nThis is what first-person shooters used to be like, kids\n\n\nIt would be forgivable for someone unfamiliar with the game to not be able to see what exactly has changed. Fortunately, in response to someone on Twitter, the person behind the mod, Jacob Freeman, uploaded two side-by-side screenshots, which show Unreal with RTX on and off.\n\n\nIt is possible to see a difference, even if it looks like they've just turned the brightness up a bit. As I said, this is still being worked on, so no doubt we'll see further progress and improvements.\n\n\nFor those who weren't around back then, Unreal was praised for its jump in FPS visuals, utilizing Epic's new engine that was named after the game. However, it would soon be left behind when Half-Life came out just a few months later. Valve's maiden release essentially stole the spotlight with its genre-shifting development techniques and storytelling methods. Unreal didn't stand much of a chance.\n\nThe post Classic FPS Unreal gets the Nvidia RTX Remix treatment appeared first on Destructoid.",

Based on the 2012 Nickelodeon series, Wrath of the Mutants takes place across a variety of environments including Coney Island and Dimension X as players try to defeat the Foot Clan and arch-nemesis Shredder.\n\n\nAll the turtles are voiced by their original voice actors: Seth Green, Sean Astin, Rob Paulsen, and Greg Cipes.\n\n\nI'm not gonna lie, I've invested some quarters—who am I kidding, dollars—into this one at Dave and Busters over the years.

The studio's announcement was issued on the heels of others today, like PlayStation, and yesterday with developer Supermassive.\n\n\nAccording to an announcement from Deck Nine Games' official Twitter, 20 percent of their staff were let go due to the \"worsening market conditions.\" This isn't the first time the studio has gone through something like this, either. In 2023, Deck Nine laid off 30 employees, with others still at the company reporting some team leads at the studio offered up their own jobs to save other staff. \n\n\n\n\nDeck Nine Games' Game Director, Stephan Frost, explained on Twitter that \"leadership took…",

          "description": "The Sims 4's classic HUD layout has been updated with a new feature in the form of a cart icon. Rather than going through the hassle of closing your game to browse the shop, this mechanic allows you to get exclusive packs in-game during your usual Sims binge season. \n\n\nA cart icon can be found near the upper-right corner, near all the traditional icons of Build Mode, Manage Worlds, and the Gallery. While there are some reservations about it from the fanbase, it is nice to have easy access to these goodies. \n\n\nScreenshot via Destructoid\n\n\nThe only setback is the fact that the entire collection won't be right in front of you, as the new cart restricts it down to a select few. Instead, recommendations will be presented, possibly based on your past purchases. \n\n\nBesides the HUD element, the new Sims 4 update features a variety of fixes across the base game and expansion packs. For Rent issues have been the primary concern for most Simmers, and now the latest patch seeks to resolve these problems. For example, saving errors and laggy performances in the Residential Rental lots have been adjusted. \n\n\nThe Sims 4 Seasons' holiday bug has also been resolved, where the themed panel only popped up with various Sims. But, even with these changes, modding will be heavily impacted, turning all the CC characters into some kind of weird Barbie (not that that's an entirely bad thing.) To adjust this, the game's Direct Communication Twitter/X suggests removing any mods or CC content for the time being. \n\n\n\n\nSims 4's newest update arrived just in time for the upcoming Crystal Creations. However, the latest Stuff pack will likely bring about more bugs and errors, so we could see more updates along the way for a better Simming experience. \n\nThe post New Sims 4 update adds cart HUD element and For Rent bug fixes appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Fans of found-footage frights will soon be able to dig into a new video game take on the Paranormal Activity film series. By \"soon\" we mean 2026, which is when the \"all-new interactive game experience\" from the devs behind The Mortuary Assistant is set to launch.\n\n\nThe Paranormal Activity: Found Footage game has DarkStone Digital (The Mortuary Assistant) and DreadXP partnering with Paramount for a release on \"multiple gaming platforms.\" In a move that's fitting for the source material, the devs are aiming for a found-footage style backed by a special \"Haunt System.\" That boils down to different types of scares depending on how you play and the actions you take throughout the game.\n\n\nYou won't get much more than that — except, perhaps, a chill up your spine — in the logo-centric teaser trailer:\n\n\n\n\nThe Paranormal Activity series first kicked off back in 2007 and quickly became a huge hit, spawning a total of seven films over the years. Directed by Oren Peli, the first entry was shot for a cool $15,000 before Paramount picked it up and pumped a little more money into it. With an global box office of around $194 million, you can see why they kept going back to that particular well. \n\n\nAs for how it's going to translate to a video game, we have a while to ponder. According to DreadXP co-director and creative director Brian Clarke, the team is taking what they learned with The Mortuary Assistant and \"cranking it up with a more reactive and horrifying haunting system.\" Hopefully we'll find some of that footage soon!\n\nThe post Paranormal Activity game teased, coming from The Mortuary Assistant dev appeared first on Destructoid.",

The creators of the game answered questions from fans in a Reddit AMA on February 27, and as one might expect, plenty wanted to know more about Initiation 4: We Sing. They got their answers from Nathalie Jankie, Marko Muikku, and John Crossland.\n\n\nChucking a musical sequence into a survival horror game is unconventional, but Remedy managed to pull it off, with Sam Lake and Ilkka Villi pulling off their best moves to the sound of the fictional band Old Gods of Asgard.

          "description": "If you haven't played Black Mesa, the unofficial (yet wholly endorsed by Valve) remake of Half-Life, it's definitely worth checking out. For those of us who have played – and enjoyed – it, the team responsible for it is teasing a new game that's currently in the pipeline.\n\n\nA video uploaded to YouTube by developer Crowbar Collective (thanks, GamesRadar) gives us just 22 seconds of something the studio is working on. All we get is the company logo followed by a colorful symbol that leaves us non the wiser. And that's it.\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to keep up-to-date with what the developer is working on, you're encouraged to sign up to the mailing list. Suffice it to say, it's impossible to know what the project is, but I bet you'll have your own theories.\n\n\nIt's probably not Half-Life 3\n\n\nIt could be a brand-new IP from Crowbar Collective. However, for all we know, it could be another remake. Perhaps of the sequel or some other classic FPS. Who knows? Not I, that's the point I'm making.\n\n\nAs for Black Mesa, it was in development for years before it finally came out in an official capacity in 2020. It rebuilds the original Half-Life from the ground up, complete with fresh voice acting.\n\n\nIt also tinkered with the OG a little bit. In order to keep diehard fans on their toes, some parts were tweaked or changed in certain respects. It also improved on the Xen aspect of the game, which some feel was lacking somewhat in Half-Life. Again, worth checking out if you're a fan of the original.\n\nThe post Studio behind the Half-Life remake Black Mesa teases a new project appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "When the end of the world comes (and it will), I like to imagine that in the midst of all the rubble and chaos, people will still be playing Skyrim. There doesn't seem to be any way that people won't tinker with the game and in this instance, we get to see dead technology being revived in order to play TES5.\n\n\nAs spotted by PCGamesN, Reddit user nekomichi recently showed that it's possible to run the game in a Steam Deck (so far so normal) using old iPods as controllers. The clip attached to the post shows it working as you would imagine.\n\n\n\n\nMovement itself requires scrolling the click wheel of the one on the right, while the left iPod is being used for turning. While walking forward and fighting seem to work pretty well, turning left and right is a bit of a janky affair.\n\n\nNot intended for speedruns\n\n\nThis idea is actually based on something nekomichi did in November 2022. A video on YouTube shows them setting up some iPods to control Skyrim via PC. Basically, it involves the installation of RockBox, an open source piece of firmware which allows the iPods to be used as devices over a USB.\n\n\nOnce installed, it becomes a case of assigning each button and wheel to an action in-game. The method used in the video is almost certainly the same that's used in the Steam Deck version (what is a Steam Deck if not a portable PC, after all).\n\n\nThey've also tested this on Sleeping Dogs, also running on the Deck. However, they say it works much better with Skyrim. There's no reason why you can't try this yourself if you happen to have some old iPods flying around. But don't expect to be speedrunning through the game.\n\nThe post Here’s Skyrim on a Steam Deck, controlled by iPods appeared first on Destructoid.",

On your hunt for your favorite cards, you'll also be able to trade with other players also hoping to perfect their collection. \n\n\nExperience Pokemon TCG like never before\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\nThe upcoming game is being developed via a three-way collaboration with Creatures Inc., the Pokemon Company, and DeNA which a company also involved with Pokemon Masters EX.\n\n\nAccording to the CEO of Creatures Inc., Yuji Kitano, care is being taken to show off the cards with effects only available digitally. One of the ways this is being done is through an immersive experience that lets you leap into the illustrations, which should be a blast when applied to full art and rare cards.  \n\n\n\n\nThe competitive element of Pokemon TCG hasn't been eliminated, and you'll still be able to battle with friends. However, Kitano explains that the rules have been streamlined to allow for quick battles. \n\n\nWe don't have details regarding any monetization strategies, though it is revealed that you'll be able to open two packs a day for free.

Arrowhead CEO Johan Pilestedt predicted on X (Twitter) that divers would reach the 800,000 player cap over the weekend. It may have accomplished just that, as more than 450,000 players answered the call of Super Earth on Steam alone. \n\n\nOn February 25, Pilestedt wrote he was \"happy and proud\" of the team and that the servers stayed online \"without problem.\" Pilestedt continued by saying it's time for the developer to go back to the \"original plan,\" and that there are \"exciting things\" in the works.\n\n\n\n\nHelldiver 604958, going dark\n\n\nBy \"exciting things,\" we're hoping he's talking about the mech suits. Mechs were teased at the end of a trailer before the game launched. There's no word on when we'll get the suits, but the trailer mentioned they would be arriving \"soon after launch.\" Now that waitlists are hopefully behind us, we may soon see which 'metal boxes with legs and guns' are best between the Helldivers and Automatons. \n\n\nBut that's not all. Before the February 25 message, Pilestedt teased some possible content that could be on its way. In a reply on X to a post about stealth gameplay, Pilestedt wrote he \"used to rock subsonic ammo and suppressor\" during playtests. He refused to elaborate before dropping an Eagle Smoke Strike and disappearing. \n\n\n\n\nWhether you play Helldivers 2 loud and proud or dream of going at it quietly, it looks like all players should have more to look forward to shortly.\n\nThe post Helldivers 2 server woes ease up, encouraging Arrowhead to return to the ‘original plan’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, regardless of whether you're a long-time fan or not, one thing new to everyone playing Rebirth is Queen's Blood. \nIntroduced early in Rebirth, Queen's Blood is an in-universe card game that seemingly everyone around Gaia's various continents plays, from Junon to Nibelheim and elsewhere.

          "description": "A massive sweep of layoffs has rocked various Sony first-party studios today, including Naughty Dog, Guerilla Games, and Insomniac. Another victim is Firesprite Games, the UK studio behind The Playroom games and The Persistence, and an additional casualty from that studio is reportedly a new Twisted Metal title.\nAccording to Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, Firesprite had a Twisted Metal game in the works that has now been canceled. He reports that the game was a live-service title and very early in development, so it was not yet officially greenlit. You can read his full report here. \nNEW: As part of today's mass layoff, Sony has canceled a Twisted Metal live-service game that was in development at UK-based studio Firesprite, Bloomberg has learned.\nhttps://t.co/pvCDsS7yxe\nFebruary 27, 2024\nTwisted Metal was PlayStation’s original flagship series, launching a couple of months after the PS1 was released in North America in the fall of 1995. The series includes eight sequels/spin-offs, the last of which remains the 2012 reboot for PS3. Peacock’s well-received live-action series has at least kept the series alive and is getting a second season. \nThe number of layoffs to hit Firespirte is currently unknown. Sony acquired Firesprite in 2021, where it helped co-develop Horizon Call of the Mountain with Guerrilla Games. 900 employees have been laid off across several Sony 1st-party studios in various department. Blood & Truth creators London Studio has been shut down entirely. PlayStation Studios Hermen Hulst has cited overgrowth as the reason for the layoffs, and that the publisher has examined its portfolio of upcoming projects to determine which ones will cease production. It would appear that whatever this Twisted Metal project would have been, it's among several titles getting the axe. \n[Source: Bloomberg]",

Unfortunately, a brief teaser trailer doesn’t do much but show some logos, so we may be waiting a while to see the game in action. \n\n\n“We are thrilled to work with Paramount Game Studios and to have the opportunity to bring the world of Paranormal Activity to gamers everywhere,” said Epic Pictures CEO and DreadXP producer Patrick Ewald in a press release. “The films are steeped in rich lore and creative scares, and under the stewardship of creative director Brian Clarke, DreadXP’s Paranormal Activity video game will honor those core tenets and offer horror fans one of our most terrifying games yet.”\nParanormal Activity has no announced platforms. It’s not the franchise’s first foray into video games. A 2017 game called Paranormal Activity: The Lost Soul was released for PS4 and PC and was playable in VR.",

Called Pokémon Legends: Z-A, the teaser suggests the game will be set in Lumiose City, a Paris-inspired area first seen in Pokémon X and Y. It's not just a long-awaited follow up to Pokémon Legends: Arceus – it's an overdue return to the world of Pokémon X and Y.\nCheck out some images from the trailer below:\n\nThe teaser, which does not contain any actual gameplay footage, shows a Pikachu hopping around a city made of glowing blue lines. While it's not immediately clear that the city is Lumiose, eagle-eyed fans will notice many familiar friends from that generation of games, including Pyroar, Flabébé, Klefki, and Hawlucha. These images are juxtaposed with architectural sketches and the words \"urban redevelopment plan.\" This would suggest that Pokémon Legends Z might take place during the construction of Lumiose City, putting it in line with the historical setting we experienced with Pokémon Legends: Arceus.\nOther than the teaser, details are scarce. We'll have to wait until 2025 to see more. Speaking of 2025, we also recently heard reports that Nintendo's Switch successor will come out no sooner than March of that year.

A mind-warping toxin has been unleashed from the magic-infused soil and dangerous Homunguli ravages the land. It’s up to protagonist Lilac, an “Attunder” capable of cleansing Homunguli, to save the day. You can check out the game's new trailer below.\n\n\nLike Ender Lilies, Ender Magnolia is a dark fantasy Metroidvania in which Lilac is paired with another entity who actually handles the killing: a Spirit Reaper capable of killing Homunguli, which, in turn, adds their abilities to your arsenal. The sprawling 2D adventure tasks players with discovering hidden collectibles, gear, and items to bolster their ability to tackle a variety of bosses.\nWhile it’s unknown exactly how long Ender Magnolia will be in Early Access, Ender Lilies also went through an Early Access phase that wound up working to the game's benefit. Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist is slated to launch for PlayStation and Xbox platforms as well as Switch later this year. In the meantime, you can read our positive review of the Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knight here.",

          "description": "Nier series creator Yoko Taro reportedly teased a third Nier game during the Nier: Orchestra Concert earlier this month. As reported by Eurogamer, during the concert, which celebrated the Nier series' music in London, Taro apparently made a surprise appearance and asked for people to clap and cheer as loudly as they could so that Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu – in attendance – could hear the demand for more Nier, according to one fan at the event. \nHowever, the biggest tease of the night came from an on-screen word that appeared multiple times throughout \"the story of the show,\" SanTheSly, the fan in attendance, writes on ResetEra. \n\n\n\"[The] word REPENT was shown repeatedly as part of some dialogue,\" SanTheSly writes. \"The final instance was spelled as R3PENT. Both me and the person I'd gone with picked up on it and wondered if this was a tease.\" \nThat sounds like a tease to us; otherwise, why else change the word \"repent\" to randomly feature a \"3.\" However, some fans of the series already consider Nier Reincarnataion, a mobile gacha game shutting down in April, to be the third game in the series. On that timeline, Nier (and its remastered Nier: Replicant counterpart) is the first in the franchise and Nier: Automata the second. If Nier Reincarnation isn't the true third Nier game, perhaps Taro was teasing that could be on the way – Nier Repent does have a nice ring to it. \n[Source: Eurogamer]\nDo you want a third Nier game?

          "description": "Japanese outlet Nikkei is reporting that the Switch successor, or \"Switch 2\" as it's been dubbed colloquially within the games industry, is targeting a March 2025 launch, according to VideoGamesChronicle. This report follows earlier reporting from VGC and other outlets like Eurogamer that Nintendo's next console was originally targeting a 2024 launch before being pushed internally to the first quarter of 2025, which lines up with Nikkei's latest reporting. \n\n\nVGC reports that Nikkei writes, \"Priority was given to ensure the initial inventory of the successor console and a lineup of software titles at the time of its launch\" to curb the possibility of a stock shortage similar to what the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S experienced back in 2020. Following previous reports, Nikkei also writes that Nintendo's next console will be a hybrid home console-portable device like the Switch with a larger screen. \nFinally, Nikkei writes the internal target is March 2025 but that the Switch 2 could slip beyond that depending on manufacturing and the software available for the console's launch at that time, according to VGC. If it does launch in March of next year, it'd follow in the Switch's footsteps, which launched in March of 2017.\nIt's important to note that all of this should be taken with a grain of salt as these delays remain internal for the time being. The Switch's successor hasn't even been publicly revealed yet, so there's no telling when to expect it officially. In the meantime, though, read about how Nintendo reportedly demoed the Switch successor to developers at Gamescom last year. \n[Source: Nikkei via VideoGamesChronicle]\nDo you think March of next year is a good time for a new Nintendo console?

We enjoyed the game a lot, and you can read about why in Game Informer's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth review. It turns out, a lot of reviewers enjoyed the game too, because at the time of this writing, it's the second-highest rated game in the Final Fantasy series on Metacritic, as noted by video game sales analyst Benji-Sales on X (formerly Twitter). \nCurrently sitting at a 93 on Metacritic, which aggregates various reviews into a single Metacritic score, only one other Final Fantasy game has been rated higher: Final Fantasy IX on PlayStation 1. It has a 94 on Metacritic.\nThere’s only 6 Final Fantasy games that have gone above a 90 Metacritic score.\npic.twitter.com/8PvD3wfpvZ\nFebruary 22, 2024\nAs you can see above, with a 93 on Metacritic, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth joins a prestigious list of games in the series with a Metacritic score of 90 or higher, as pointed out by AndSpaceY on X. Now, it's important to note that some Final Fantasy games are not rated on Metacritic as the aggregate site was not around when they released. For example, Final Fantasy VI is one of the most beloved entries in the franchise and arguably the best – released in 1994 on the SNES, Metacritic was not around at the time so it does not have a rating on the site. \nStill, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth rating so high is another example of how Square Enix's Final Fantasy VII remake project is landing with both critics and fans alike. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth review and then check out our Final Fantasy VII Rebirth cover story hub for exclusive features, videos, and more.

Discovery chief financial officer Gunnar Wiedenfels who said Rocksteady's latest effort fell short of the company's expectations. However, Wiedenfels did not mention a sales figure. According to IGN, the executive lamented that Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League's missed expectations set Warner Bros.' games division up for a tough year when it comes to year-on-year comparisons.\nWiedenfels is likely alluding to Hogwarts Legacy, the company's massive hit that launched last year and went on to become the best-selling game of 2023, beating out titles like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. The sales of Hogwarts Legacy was certainly a tough act for Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League to follow. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's review of Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, and then check out Game Informer's list of the best superhero games of all time. After that, read our list of upcoming superhero games to look forward to. \n[Source: IGN]\nHave you been playing Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League?

During a livestream held by Evening Star on the game's February 21 launch, one designer completed the first level with a single, two-minute combo, and it's a feat to behold. \nIf you haven't yet checked out Penny's Big Breakaway, it's a 3D platformer modeled off the strange and weird platformers of the PlayStation 1 generation, rather than Nintendo's popular platforming efforts. As such, the game features a unique moveset that feels similar to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, with a Devil May Cry combo meter to boot. \nCheck out the Evening Star developer reach a massive 191-move combo in the first stage of Vanillatown, the first world in Penny's Big Breakaway, below: \nVanillatown 1-1 100% in just 1 combo!?\n#PennysBigBreakaway pic.twitter.com/F7kIiAjldU\nFebruary 22, 2024\nAs you can see, this designer – Milena – completes the first level with one continuous combo. We're not sure we're quite up to the task but we wouldn't be surprised if fans of the game spend time outcomboing this score. Only time will tell. \nPenny's Big Breakaway is now available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. \nFor more about the game, check out the Penny's Big Breakaway launch trailer here and then read Game Informer's exclusive behind-the-scenes feature about the game's creation, the people making it, the music, and more. \nAre you playing Penny's Big Breakaway?

          "description": "It’s been a long time since Little Devil Inside, a promising survival action RPG from indie developer Neostream, has made any noise. The game’s last substantial update came in October 2021. But after over two years of silence, Neostream has come back with a new trailer and cryptic update hinting at what’s been going on with the team.\nAs reported by The Indie Informer, Neostream’s Kickstarter post, published yesterday, apologizes for the lack of updates and cryptically alludes to an internal conflict within the team, potentially due to clashing visions about the game, being one of the causes. It states in part,\nThe rest of Neostream's update indicates the team has reduced in size but confirms that the founders and core members remain at the studio. The studio assures backers that Little Devil Inside still exists and that it is currently discussing publishing before it can give fans a more substantial update. Until then, the team has prepared a six-minute montage video showing off the game running in Unreal Engine 5.\n\n\nLittle Devil Inside was first revealed way back in 2015 with the launch of its Kickstarter campaign, but it gained its first mainstream recognition as part of the 2020 PlayStation 5 showcase prior to the console's launch. You play as an explorer who embarks on research mission at the behest of a university professor to explore a large world filled with beasts both real and supernatural. You'll visit different towns along the way to meet quirky citizens, defend yourself from threats with a sword, and engage in survival mechanics like camping and cooking. Despite how much time as past, we ultimately still know relatively little about Little Devil Inside but it has remained a charmer each time it resurfaces. \nLittle Devil Inside has no release window but we're hoping to learn more concrete details in the near future.",

Since that launch, support for the platform has been sparse, to say the least, especially from PlayStation itself. However, Sony has revealed it is currently testing PC support for PS VR2, with hopes to make that support available this year. \n\"[We're] pleased to share that we are currently testing the ability for PS VR2 players to access additional games on PC to offer even more game variety in addition to the PS VR2 titles available through PS5,\" a new PlayStation Blog post published today reads. \"We hope to make this support available in 2024, so stay tuned for more updates.\"\n\n\nThe rest of the blog goes on to detail new and upcoming titles coming to PS VR2, but those are going to be playable with PlayStation 5 consoles. However, it sounds like PC support, which could open up a flood gate for new VR content, might arrive later this year. \nFor more about the hardware, read Game Informer's PS VR2 review, and then read Game Informer's Horizon Call of the Mountain review.

          "description": "Riot Games has rechristened Project L, its upcoming League of Legends fighting game, to its official name of 2XKO. While we still don’t know when it’s coming, we do get another look at it in a new trailer.\n\n\nThe 2D 2v2 tag-team fighter looks very promising based on today’s footage. The game takes cues from Marvel vs Capcom in its assist-focused tag team play and utilizes more simplified inputs to lower the barrier for entry while maintaining strategic depth. Based on previous updates, online play features rollback netcode. Set in the world of Runterra, 2XKO features a roster of League of Legends champions, including Darius, Ekko, Ahri, and Yasuo. As Riot states on the game’s website, it’s still “heads down” working on updates to share, so a release window may not be coming in the near future. \n2XKO was first announced as Project L in 2019 alongside other League of Legends projects, including what would later become Valorant and LoL: Wild Rift. Hopefully, it will cross the finish line sooner than later. What do you think of the game's official title and this fresh look at gameplay? Let us know in the comments.",

While that reveal included details about the survival aspects of the game, including multiplayer, crafting, and farming, viewers honed in on the idea of it being Pokémon but with guns. You can capture Pokémon-like monsters called Pals in special balls (and you can capture humans, too), but it's smart to shoot them or hack at them with an axe first to lower their health. And then, once under your command, you can give them their own guns to use, of course. \nFollowing various trailers since that 2021 reveal, including this gameplay showcase and this one highlighting the different Pals you can find, we learned at Geoff Keighely's Summer Game Fest last year that Palworld would finally…",

Now, it's time for a new fighter from a different universe to join the roster. John Cena's Peacemaker, the hero that first appeared in 2021's The Suicide Squad and later in his epoynomous HBO Max series, joins the game next week on February 28. \nAhead of his release, NetherRealm Studios has released the first look at Peacemaker's gameplay in Mortal Kombat 1, and it features a lot of justice, a lot of peace, and, of course, a lot of blood. \nCheck out the Peacemaker gameplay trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, Peacemaker is voiced by Cena himself and features moves inspired by the character's live-action counterpart. That includes the fatality, which starts with Peacemaker ripping Quan-Chi in half by way of jet pack before sonic booming the rest of his body into bits. \nPeacemaker hits the Mortal Kombat 1 roster on February 28 for those who own the Premium Edition of the game or the Kombat Pack. Peacemaker goes live for individual purchase on March 6. \nElsewhere in this trailer, we learn that Janet Cage is joining the game as a new Kameo fighter in March – she's an alternate version of Johnny Cage from a different reality. We also learn that crossplay (or Krossplay as NetherRealm calls it) will go live on February 28, allowing PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store) players to fight against each other in-game. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Mortal Kombat 1 review. \nAre you going to play as Peacemaker in Mortal Kombat 1 next week?

          "description": "Following today's Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase, many were surprised the heavily rumored Hi-Fi Rush was absent. However, shortly after that presentation, which confirmed Pentiment and Grounded are both arriving on Switch, we learned that the next of the four previous Xbox exclusives Phil Spencer said last week are coming to additional platforms. Hi-Fi Rush, a rhythm-action title from the studio behind The Evil Within and Ghostwire: Tokyo, is joining the PlayStation 5 library, as confirmed by Xbox Wire.\nHi-Fi Rush surprise launched on Xbox Series X/S and PC in January 2023, quickly becoming a critical darling and fan favorite. While many were shocked the colorful game was created by the horror developers at Tango Gameworks, fans quickly fell in love with the stylish combat, beautiful presentation, and fun integration of music.\nHi-Fi Rush arrives on PS5 on March 19. According to reporting by The Verge, the final previously exclusive game jumping across the aisle is Sea of Thieves. Hi-Fi Rush took home Game Informer's 2023 \"Best Microsoft Exclusive\" award and, as of this writing, has a spot on our Top 10 Xbox Series X Games list.

          "description": "During today's Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase, we learned Grounded is coming to Switch this April, but that's not the only Obsidian-developed title fans can expect. Blending the adventure genre with a gorgeous storybook aesthetic, Pentiment was a critical darling when it launched on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC in 2022. Now, a new stable of players will have the chance to experience the title, as it is coming to Switch tomorrow.\nPentiment puts you in control of Andreas Maler, a 16th-century artist from Nuremberg who finds himself in the middle of several murder mysteries. Taking place over the course of 25 years, you must investigate the murders, collect physical proof, interview townsfolk, and accuse who you think committed the crime based on the evidence you gather. \nWhen it launched on Xbox in PC, Pentiment earned an 86 on reviews aggregate sites Metacritic and OpenCritic. Game Informer's Charles Harte felt similarly, awarding it an 8.5 out of 10, saying Pentiment is \"a perfect example of this, telling a deep, complex story about religion, truth, and history in the form of a book, which the player experiences as it’s being written. Despite a few sections with inconsistent pacing, it’s a must-play for fans of adventure games.\"\nPentiment arrives on Nintendo Switch tomorrow, February 22. For more on the title, be sure to check out our review here. Pentiment joins Grounded as previous Xbox exclusives to come to Switch. According to Xbox's Phil Spencer, there are four games in total that will arrive on additional platforms in the near future. The other two are reportedly Sea of Thieves and Hi-Fi Rush, but neither was featured on today's Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase.",

Publisher Bandai Namco and developer From Software released the add-on's first official trailer this morning which revealed it is launching June 21. Bandai Namco is also releasing a physical version of the game, the Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree Collector's Edition, which includes a statue and other goodies.\nYou can check out the trailer below.\n\n\nThe trailer begins by focusing on a setting where an optional boss appeared in the main game and where you can find Miquella's egg. The trailer shows new monsters and bosses, like a lion creature with a rotating head and another made entirely of flames. There are also new abilities, items, and weapons, one of which appears to be a roaring bear's head. There is also some kind a porcupine alligator creature and the player character sprouted angel wings in one fight. Those are just a few of the standout reveals.\n\nThe game's official product page does confirm a few additional details, like the name of the main boss seems to be Mesmer the Impaler. Shadow of the Erdtree is also not standalone despite carrying a $39.99 price tag. The page refers to it as an expansion and it will require the base game. Here's the official description.\nThe Shadow of the Erdtree expansion features an all-new story set in the Land of Shadow imbued with mystery, perilous dungeons, and new enemies, weapons and equipment.\nDiscover uncharted territories, face formidable adversaries, and revel in the satisfying triumph of victory.

We need as many people as possible to test this beta version of the 14.X release series, so you can find and we can squash as many bugs as possible before the actual release. To guide you a bit towards what you should be looking for: Generic gameplay bugs and crashes. There is a new Ship Pathfinder; test it out. Buoys are optional to use. You can now automatically unbunch your vehicles at a depot. We added our own interpretation of daylength to the game. More on this soon in another blog post. There are many GUI improvements throughout the game. More consistent look, better GUI scaling. There are many more things worth talking about, and this will be made more clear when we approach the release of 14.0. But for now, play the game, and please report any issues you find.

For details of bugs fixed in each preview\nrelease, see previous entries on this blog.\nAccess real devices with Device Streaming in Android Studio\n\nDevice streaming in Android Studio lets you securely connect to remote physical Android devices hosted in Google's secure data centers. Powered by Firebase, it's the fastest and easiest way to test your app against real devices, including the Google Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, select Samsung devices, and more.\n\nAfter connecting to a device, you can deploy your app, view the display, interact with the device (including rotating or unfolding the device), and anything else you might do with a device over a direct ADB over SSL connection—all without leaving Android Studio. When you're done using the device, Google wipes all your data and factory resets the device before making it available to another developer.\nDuring Open Alpha, you can use Device Streaming at no cost. To get started simply sign into your Developer account from Android Studio and select a Firebase project. If you don't already have a Firebase project, it's easy to create one. To learn more, go to Device Streaming in Android Studio.\n\nGeneral fixes and features\nBelow is a list of general fixes in Android Studio Jellyfish | 2023.3.1 Canary 9 and Android Gradle Plugin 8.4.0-alpha09 These are a result of your bug \nreports, which help us to make Android Studio better.
