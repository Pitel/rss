The last title to feature the onion-layered ogre was DreamWorks Super Star Kartz, released by Activision in 2011 for the Wii, Xbox 360, PS3, and 3DS. It’s somewhat fitting, then, that he would return in another DreamWorks karting game, and equally fitting that it too feels two generations old.\nDreamWorks All-Star Kart Racing is the latest offering from Bamtang Games, which was previously responsible for the Nickelodeon Kart Racers trilogy (which started weak on Switch, got better with the second game then lost its way again with the final entry). Sadly, while this DreamWorks-themed racer has a number of decent ideas, the execution is as sloppy as a Bergin eating a Troll.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Shigeru Miyamoto himself took to Twitter to share this news, stating that producer Avi Arad and director Wes Ball are already attached and it will be co-financed by Sony (a fact that we are still wrapping our heads around). Oh, and it is also going to be live-action. Let's not forget that bit.\nIf this were to be announced as an animated film, we would be on board in a heartbeat (heck, we have dreamt about a Studio Ghibli or even Sony Pictures Animation, Spider-Verse take on the series for years now) but live-action cinema comes with its own set of challenges. What does a 'real-life' Hyrule look like? Who really wants to see a realistically rendered Zora?

But does the expansion end with a bang or a whimper? Well, much like prior waves, we’d say this one lands somewhere in the middle, offering up a bunch of solid circuits mixed in with a few mildly disappointing ones.\nPretty much par for the course, then, but let’s just remind ourselves of what’s included with this one. You’ve got two new cups — the Acorn Cup and the Spiny Cup — made up of three Tour tracks and five ‘legacy’ courses from previous series entries. Oh, and you've four new characters to try out, too.

There's the standard version of the pack, which includes access to previous expansions, currency for cosmetics and a level 70 character boost. The Heroic edition gives you all that plus a mount, a pet and extra in-game cash. And then there's the most expensive Epic edition, which includes a pet, two toys, 30 days of game time... and three days of early beta access to the game, yours for $89.99 in the states. \r\n\n\r\nNaturally, World of Warcrafters are rather concerned about the last bit. It's the first time Blizzard's long-running MMO has taken the paid early access approach, recently adopted by Starfield and Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 - there have been early access betas in the past, but they've been doled out by lottery. Blizzard's game director Ion Hazzikostas has now moved to reassure the grousers and gripers, promising that The War Within's Epic edition won't give minted early worms the edge over those poor peasants who scoop up the less pricey versions.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Its reveal was a surprise, mind – haven’t Valve repeatedly said that there wouldn’t be another new Steam Deck for ages?\r\n\n\r\nNot quite. That warning was always qualified in that a more powerful Deck was still a ways off, and the Steam Deck OLED’s performance improvements are both tiny and a likely incidental result of its efficiency savings. This very point was repeated to me in an interview with Valve designer Jay Shaw and software engineer Jeremy Selan, which also covered the Steam Deck family’s future, its current struggles with intensive big-budget games, and why they want \"more, more, more\" rivals like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go.\r\n\n \nRead more",

As great a handheld gaming PC as the original Steam Deck is, its slightly bland IPS display and short battery life are some definite weak points – points to which newer, shinier rivals, such as the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go, have been happy to apply pressure.\nValve are keen to stress that this OLED-equipped model represents an update, not a whole generational switcheroo. Yet there’s much, much more behind that screen that just some different diodes. This is a lighter, brighter, longer-lasting, sometimes even faster-running take on the SteamOS handheld, and one that sneaks in some surprise upgrades as often as it addresses issues with the original Steam Deck.

As he makes clear to his army of Russian ultranationalists, he is interested only in their quiet, unwavering loyalty. Evidently, Activision expects much the same from its army of COD fans. This latest Modern Warfare campaign follows disconcertedly close on the heels of 2022’s entry because, as per Bloomberg, it began life as a mere expansion. Rather than allow a fallow year, Activision has upgraded that expansion’s status to a premium release, and charged $69.99 for pre-orders - granting early access to the single-player campaign as an enticement.\r\n\n\r\nInstead of Modern Warfare’s usual lead studio, Infinity Ward, development duties have fallen to Sledgehammer, the outfit most recently responsible for 2021’s unloved Vanguard. And in an industry where AAA FPS games now regularly take half a decade to make, this campaign has reportedly come together in less than two years. Reader: it shows.\r\n\n \nRead more",

A faked death finally saw him freed from the shackles of the yakuza with one big catch: he couldn't ever see his family again. Since then, we've had the plucky Ichiban take on the mantle of Tojo Clan nastiness in Yakuza: Like A Dragon (7), with its sequel Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth (8) set to wash up on Hawaii's shores next year. What do we know about Infinite Wealth? Kiryu is set to return as a protagonist alongside Ichiban, with an all-new haircut. And more importantly, what has Like A Dragon Gaiden got to do with any of this? Well, it's a shorter stop-gap between the events of Yakuza 6 and Yakuza 8 that fills us in on what Kiryu's been up to this whole time.\nBut aside from moreish minigames and a fantastic Agent persona with web-slinging abilities, Kiryu's epilogue is a far cry from Yakuza's best stories. By no means is it bad, it just isn't the best introduction to the series for newcomers, and even longtime fans will struggle balancing his resurrection with its heavy feelings of repetition.\nRead more",

I want someone who really, really loves and hates things, and gives you reasons why.”\nIt’s a trait which Giovannetti has in common with his Megacrit co-founder, Casey Yano, and has possessed ever since he was a kid growing up in Woodinville, 30 minutes outside Seattle. It’s matched by a competitiveness that first emerged in Warhammer 40,000 tournaments as a teen.

Echoing his relatively guarded enthusiasm for NFTs a couple of years ago, he’s sort of mixed on them, regarding AI tools less as transformative technologies than simply the latest step towards the eternal industry objective of More, Faster And Better For Less.\nZelnick thinks automated learning and generation tools will make development more “efficient” and games, overall “better”, but in terms of Take-Two’s own bottom line, any gains will likely be offset by the fact that other big companies have access to the same tools, and by the fact that Take-Two will take advantage of said efficiencies by setting more ambitious goals. As such, he doesn’t think using generative AI will lead to lower prices for big commercial games. If you’re a developer that can’t afford to buy or license generative “AI” tools, Zelnick added, you can expect competition to become “more intense” in the coming years. Good stuff. \nRead more",

One of my favourites is Dell's Alienware AW3423DWF, a 34-inch ultrawide that offers a fairly standard 3440x1440 165Hz spec - but its QD-OLED panel makes for a night-and-day difference against your standard VA and IPS panel alternatives, with perfect contrast, near-instant pixel response times, gorgeous colour reproduction and stunning HDR. \nIt normally retails for around £929, but today it's down to £739 when you use the code GROUPON8 at Dell UK. That's about as cheap as we've ever seen it, and well worth it for anyone that wants a monitor primarily for gaming rather than content creation or mixed purposes. \nRead more",

          "description": "Hallowe’en may be over (just), but for this month’s Reality Frights, I’ve got a wonderfully seasonal game for you. It’s the brand-new remake of the grand old mystery puzzler The 7th Guest, a game which Bill Gates notably referred to as “The new standard of interactive entertainment.” In fairness to ol’ William, he said this seven months before Doom blew out the new standard’s insides with a 12-gauge shotgun, shunting PC gamers’ tastes away from kitsch adventure games and toward grisly murder-fests. But The 7th Guest is nonetheless fondly remembered for its spooky atmosphere, alongside its blend of pre-rendered backgrounds and live action cutscenes you could call ‘pioneering’ had it not proved such an evolutionary dead end.\nToday, the original 7th Guest looks more dated than Henry VIII, which is probably why this remake replaces everything but the very skeleton of the 1993 original. The game still takes place in a creepy mansion belonging to a murderous toymaker, and still involves six eccentric guests to the house searching for a missing boy named Tad. But it’s otherwise been completely rebuilt, with whole new puzzles and whole new mechanics, all designed to be experienced in first-person VR.\nRead more",

I've long admired their intricate dances of orbs and criss-crossing laser fire, but I have long resigned myself to merely being a spectator of such games, rather than an active ship pilot. Cobalt Core, however, is exactly my kind of speed. It's not a bullet hell shooter, but it is about two spaceships facing off against each other in an eyes-locked duel of incoming cannon fire, and sliding side to side to avoid getting exploded as you attempt to unravel the mysterious timeloop your crew of weird space animals appear to be stuck in. Just, you know, in a neat, turn-based fashion, where your opponent's attacks are flagged up in advance, and you must use your randomised deck of cards to weave and dodge your way to victory. It's very moreish, and very Into The Breach. I love it. \nRead more",

You're not fooling me, Croteam. I'm here to solve puzzles and discuss philosophy, and I know you are too. You can't stop talking about philosophy in this game, and frankly, I wouldn't have it any other way. \nMillenia may have passed since the events of The Talos Principle, but the problems faced by this new society of advanced robo-humans (of which you are number 1000 to be 'born' into this world) still feel all too relevant to the issues posed by the lives we're living today: what is the price of progress? Will we ignore the mistakes of the past and push the world toward irreparable destruction? And why have cats remained loyal to this new race of robo-people, cementing their status as the superior future pet, when dogs have devolved back into vicious wolves?

It was a game in which every footfall felt like a gamble and every second lasted an eternity, even before you entered the lair of a giant spider. Fast  forward to 2023, and streamers are playing Hunt: Showdown like it's Titanfall 2, scurrying along walls with scant regard for the NPC cannon fodder below, duelling each other on rooftops with pistol shotguns, and tearing through those poor, befuddled boss monsters like sandcastles.\r\n\n\r\nThus the fate of any competitive shooter lucky enough to acquire a seasoned pro following, I guess. But still, returning to Crytek's PvPvE shooter has been a shock, and speaking to the development team, it sounds like the devs themselves have been struggling to keep up with the more ambitious players, too. Showdown was never expected to endure quite this long and evolve in quite this way, according to general manager David Fifield, and managing the community's ambitions for the game is as much of a challenge as compensating for the limitations of its ageing engine.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Sure, there’s the looming threat of Garlean invasion and/or the possibility of world destruction throughout A Realm Reborn and its expansions - but on the plus side, almost everyone you meet is up for a round of cards.\r\n\n\r\nOver the last quarter-century, Triple Triad has managed to escape its origins as a fun side minigame in Final Fantasy VIII to become a fully-fledged phenomenon in XIV. The Gold Saucer runs regular tournaments, random strangers are happy to be challenged to a match - often throwing in one or more of the game’s many variant rules (though Chaos can do one) - and might even give up one of their prized cards when defeated, with almost 400 to collect as of the game’s latest patches. Emphasis on the “might”: I dread to think of the hours spent replaying NPCs in the hope of a random drop as I filled out my collection.\r\n\nI headed along to Final Fantasy’s London Fan Fest last month with a fetching deck of Triple Triad cards in hand. (Square Enix provided entrance and accommodation for the event.) Where better to try and live the dream of challenging random strangers to a card game, and learn more about the community that has fallen in love with the MMO in the 10 years since A Realm Reborn released?\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I have a confession to make, readers. I'm mildly obsessed with Starfield's cuboid food brand Chunks. In all honesty, I'm kinda obsessed with Starfield's food in a more general sense, and I have almost as many screenshots of its tube-like meal boxes, stale toast slices, vacuum-packed sachets of rice balls, steak slabs and spiced worms - and, of course, Chunks - as I do its planets and NPCs. I'm weirdly fascinated by what Bethesda think our future meals will look like when we eventually start travelling across the stars, and not just because I like ragging on their somewhat plastic-looking textures and marvelling at how everything from orange juice to beer and wine comes in kid's size cartons with a little straw on the side. \nChunks are my favourite food of the lot, though. These cubes of faintly glistening organic matter are bite-sized monstrosities that are quite possibly some of the most unholy things I've ever seen. How this became the dominating foodstuff across the known galaxy is a mystery worthy of its own sidequest, because let's be honest, I'm all for eating wonky fruit and vegetables, but would you truly go to shop, sit down at a table and order an apple that's been squeezed into a perfect cube? Or a cube with yellow skin that professes to call itself grilled chicken? I would probably try them once for curiosity's sake (it's the food of the future, of course I want to know what that tastes like!), but it's also exactly the kind of thing I'd swear off immediately because nope, nuh uh, I just can't even contemplate it anymore. And then it dawned on me: this is exactly how I feel about Starfield as a whole.\nRead more",

Football Manager 2024 is the last iterative game in the series before Project Dragonfly arrives next year, through which Sports Interactive plan the most radical overhaul of the game since the introduction of the 3D match engine in FM 09. This includes a complete rebuild of Football Manager in Unity, implementing brand new animation technology, and the inclusion of women’s football. But there is a reason why the studio has stuck with this tried and tested formula for so long. Big changes come with big risks, and as any Man Utd fan will know, those changes don’t always pay off.\r\n\n\r\nBut such concerns are for the future. FM24 is with us right now, and while it may be swapping the dugout for the stands ninety minutes from now, this isn’t some ceremonial exhibition match. It’s business as usual, and in mostly good ways. Sports Interactive have made meaningful changes to the management game both on and off the pitch, all built on top of fundamentals that remain as complex and compulsive as they have for years. That said, FM24 also demonstrates why a change is welcome, as in its current form it can struggle to strike the balance between authenticity and fun.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The android is unresponsive, standing frozen mid-step with one foot off the ground. I hold its metal head in my hands, tilting it this way and that as I stare into its cold red eye. It offers no resistance to my pushes and pulls, as though I was a hairdresser directing a patron’s head. Based on Stanisław Lem’s 1964 novel of the same name, The Invincible’s Firewatch-like first-person adventure is intent on exploring how machines will come to shape humanity’s future. Over the course of its ten-hour story, where you step into the Soviet-styled space boots of biologist Yasna, you will take on her desperate search for the missing crew of her research ship, The Dragonfly, lost somewhere on the rocky, sandstorm-whipped world of Regis III.\nUsing a logbook filled with hand-drawn maps and scrawled notes, I’ve tracked Yasna’s crew to a makeshift game to the east of where they originally landed. Instead of humans, I find the lifeless robot. I want the android to give me answers, to tell me where my crew mates are, to explain what happened on Regis III, and why I can’t remember anything before I woke up in the desert with my possessions scattered around me.\nRead more",

Released out of early access today, it's a blend of fantasy table-top gaming and roguelite, in which you lead a party of adventurers across a hexagonal map to quash an evil Queen in grid, dice and turn-based combat. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "What kind of game does the label “survival horror” denote? Since its inconspicuous first appearance in the original Resident Evil’s loading screen (functioning first and foremost, lest we forget, as a handy marketing catchphrase), the term has been so enthusiastically embraced and haphazardly applied as to be rendered almost meaningless in 2023. Horror gaming has witnessed multiple seismic shifts since 1996, most notably the turn to action-oriented design with the likes of The Suffering and Resident Evil 4 in the mid-2000s, as well as the rise of spooky almost-walking-simulators like SOMA in the mid-2010s. \r\n\nYet the term survival horror has expanded to such a degree that it now seems to stand in, albeit rather awkwardly, for the entirety of video game horror. Even with the caveat that borders for these kinds of labels are notoriously hard to define, survival horror remains an unusually amorphous realm, one that (as a quick search of the relevant tag on Steam will reveal) lays claim as much to first-person bloodbaths like Zombie Army Trilogy as it does moody, combat-free adventures like Visage. Still, old distinctions linger, and a clutch of recent indie survival horrors qualify their work with the word “classic”. I interviewed some of the developers to find out why - and, more importantly, what classic survival horror means. \r\n\n \nRead more",

You'll be able to watch the show live on YouTube. \n\n\nAs Gematsu reports, the event will run for half an hour, and English subtitles will be available. You can expect to receive plenty of information and release dates for upcoming Level-5 games including Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road, DECAPOLICE, FANTASY LIFE i: The Girl Who Steals Time, Megaton Musashi Wired, and Professor Layton and The New World of Steam. \n\n\nThe last Vision 2023 event was held in March and it featured trailers for several titles, including Megaton Musashi Wired. During this month's event, I'll be looking out for the latest entry in the Professor Layton series which will hopefully receive a release date. It appeared at the previous event, giving us a look into what we can expect from the story. \n\n\n\n\nThe latest Inazuma Eleven game will also be worth taking a peek at. It was originally slated for a 2018 release, but several delays have pushed it back for years. Hopefully, the long wait is almost over.\n\nThe post LEVEL-5 Vision 2023 II scheduled for November 29 appeared first on Destructoid.",

With only a year and a half to work on the game, development was fraught with issues, Schreier's sources reveal. \n\n\nAs Schreier explains, MW3 was originally pitched as a DLC, but the game was suddenly turned into a standalone title to fill in a gap in the company's release schedule after another 2023 CoD game planned for this year was delayed. This has been denied by an Activision spokesperson, but Schreier insists that \"more than a dozen current and former Call of Duty developers said that conflicts with what they were told at the time.\"\n\n\n\n\nAs you can imagine, having such a short development time required many Sledgehammer employees to work long hours, includin…",

          "description": "Today Sony revealed that it’s shifting its strategy with live service games. The company is scaling back the number of live service games it plans by fiscal year 2025 to launch by half.\n\n\nIn case you didn’t remember, just last May Sony announced ambitious plans to release a total of 12 live service games by the end of its fiscal 2025. In theory, having a deep catalog of live service titles would give Sony a steady stream of income from players who fully bought into their favorite games. Now, Sony seems to be acknowledging that creating that deep catalog is easier said than done. \n\n\nIn a November 9 earnings call, Hiroki Totoki, COO, CFO, and President of Sony, elaborated on what led to this change in plans. Totoki said that after Sony acquired Bungie last July, the company had the developer help refine its plan for live service games. Ultimately, Totoki said that Sony realized it’s previous plan wouldn’t be able to produce satisfactory games. \n\n\n“We have not been able to meet the gamers’ expectations,” Totoki said, “But we are trying as much as possible [to ensure these games will] be played by gamers and liked by gamers for a long time.” To make that happen, Totoki said, “six titles will be released by FY25. That’s our current plan.” \n\n\nThe other six live service games aren’t going anywhere just yet. Totoki said that the company is still deciding when those games will be released, but for now it will focus on making sure the first six games are as good as possible. He didn’t mention which games made the cut for the initial six, so the fate of specific titles like The Last of Us multiplayer, which was delayed earlier this year, is still up in the air. \n\nThe post Sony delays half of its 12 planned live service games appeared first on Destructoid.",

In the 15-second long teaser, we can see Jinx solemnly walking towards what appears to be the Bridge of Progress in Piltover, but it’s surrounded in an ominous shade of crimson.\n\n\n\n\nIn the teaser, we can hear Jinx humming the melody line from “The Bridge,” which is featured in the score for the first season. Behind that, her footsteps echo and what could be the environment catching aflame and chaos ensuing can be heard. It’s bound to be an exciting continuation, based on this alone. \n\n\nIt’s not exactly news that Arcane is getting a second season. Shortly after the first season concluded on November 20, 2021, the powers that be at Riot Games made the announcement that a second season was “in production.” It’s not even news that the series would be returning at the end of 2024, thanks to an investor presentation given by Tencent in September 2023, which revealed it’d be coming during Q4.\n\n\nBut, we now know for certain that Arcane will be returning in November 2024. I am not at all sure why we’re being told now, with a year left to wait for more of the League of Legends story, but some of the recent strikes in Hollywood that may have put a pause on production. \n\n\nI suppose we’ve already waited two years, what’s one more?

According to Polgyon, at least 20 employees in total were let go. It appears Digital Extremes is closing their external projects division which publishes games like the recently Early Access release title Wayfinder. Instead, the company will shift its focus towards internal projects like Warframe and Soulframe. \n\n\nWe reached out to Digital Extremes who confirmed the information and provided the following statement\n\n\n\n“We can confirm we have made the difficult decision to cease operations of our external projects division. We have had to say goodbye to a number of hardworking and highly valuable team members as a result.”\n\n\n\n\nThe representative also confirmed that Digital Extremes is looking to transfer Wayfinder in its entirety into the hands of the developer, Airship Syndicate.\n\n\n\n\"“We're working with Airship to transition full control of Wayfinder to them in coming months.\"\n\n\n\n\nJust a few weeks ago there was a leadership change at Digital Extremes as well, with Chief Creative Officer Steven Sinclair replacing Founder James Schmalz as CEO of the company.\n\n\nRough times in the video games industry\n\n\nThese kinds of articles are never easy to write, especially when the video game industry seems to be suffering layoffs several times a week. Just yesterday Embracer Group laid off staff at developer Free Radical, after doing the same just last month at Cryptic Studios and Zen Studios. Ubisoft Montreal also suffered layoffs earlier this week.\n\n\nThis list has grown so big it almost feels easier to name the companies that have not conducted layoffs compared to those that have.

However, PlayStation and a few musicians, including Alex Moukala, have released such a thing, and it's relaxing AF.\n\n\n\n\nChilling out with Atreus\n\n\nAtreus, in this video published Thursday, takes the place of the kid studying. As the chill music is playing, he's writing in his journal. The Lo-Fi beats in the background are from popular musician and composer Alex Moukala and Pokari.\n\n\n\"Earlier this year, Sony asked me to create some God of War: Ragnarok Lo-Fi remixes for them,\" Moukala on social media. \"As a massive Bear McCreary fan I was overjoyed and simply couldn't say no!\" The composer later said \"the whole process made [him] appreciate God of War's soundtrack even more than [he] already did.\"\n\n\nThe three McCreary songs both Moukala and Polari remixed are: \"Huldra Brothers,\" \"Memories of Mother,\" and the God of War Ragnarök theme. They sound fantastic and are currently powering me through this news story. The animation is also expressive and slightly changes over the span of the 32-minute video. It was drawn and animated by Spud Gun Studios.\n\n\nMoukala has been busy over the past few years. He's behind the soundtrack for the fan-based Final Fantasy IX: Memoria Project and interviewed the Yakuza game composers on his YouTube channel. In the past, he's also turned the macabre Bloodborne music into a dazzling Mario Kart track.\n\n\n\n\nGod of War: Ragnarok celebrates its one-year anniversary this week. When it was first released, it received critical praise across the board. \n\n\n\"God of War Ragnarok is a fantastic showcase of what this series has to offer, and a sterling example of how it still has life left in it,\" said our review. \"While not everything lands with the sequel from a story perspective, the core of the original is preserved, with some new twists and turns still to go.\"\n\nThe post Official God of War Ragnarok Lo-Fi video lets us relax between slaying gods appeared first on Destructoid.",

Now it's set to launch on consoles later this month.\n\n\nDANGEN Entertainment and PINIX Games announced plans to bring Alina of the Arena to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox digital stores on November 23, 2023. In addition to the deckbuilding of Slay the Spire, the devs cite Into the Breach as inspiration. Alina of the Arena blends roguelite elements with hex-based tactics, resource management, and more that unfolds in strategic position-based gladiator battles. You can see a sample of its style in the release date trailer and screens. \n\n\n\n\nAlina of the Arena follows a gladiator named Alina who aims to entertain a particularly bloodthirsty crowd while rising up the ranks. You can pick up weapons the crowd tosses into the arena, upgrade equipment, and acquire new cards to improve your strategy. Some cards may help Alina deal more damage, while others assist in avoiding attacks or even pitting enemies against one another for a tactical advantage. \n\n\nThe flow of each level spans standard battles, elite battles, shops, events, and ultimately a showdown with the arena's champion. Permanent upgrades can be unlocked along with new builds to give you a fighting chance in successive runs.\n\n\nScreenshot via DANGEN Entertainment\n\n\nAre you not entertained?\n\n\nAlina of the Arena picked up some accolades following its initial launch on PC. In addition to nominations at events like BitSummit and IndiePlay, it won the Best Design Indie Game Award at Taipei Game Show 2023. Outside of UI updates, it sounds like we can expect the same features that made it a success when it lands on consoles on November 23. \n\nThe post Tactical deckbuilder Alina of the Arena arrives on consoles this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

Effectively an upgrade to the baseline Steam Deck model, the OLED variant will even have a substantially upgraded battery, making the device that much more appealing.\n\n\nWhat's particularly interesting here is that as the OLED model of the Steam Deck rolls in, Valve is phasing out the 64 GB and the 512 GB variants of the original device. As of right now, these version of the Deck are only going to stay in stock while supplies last (with an appropriate price drop), and new buyers will be able to purchase the following versions of the device in the future:\n\n\n\n256 GB LCD version of the Steam Deck at $399\n\n\n512 GB OLED version of the Steam Deck at $549\n\n\n1 TB OLED version of the Steam Deck at $649\n\n…",

It’s available today on Steam and Itch.\n\n\nAs a pedestrian, cars are my mortal enemy. Unfortunately, so far, my only way of fighting back against them is with my fists. I guess that’s because I chose to write about video games rather than become a civil engineer. According to Sebil Engineering, they are given pipe-wrenches that can increase or decrease the height of nodes on the edges of roads to give traffic a shunt in the correct direction.\n\n\n\n\nEach level begins with a stream of cars pouring in from the margins. Your job is to change the heights of the road to direct that stream to the correct spot. I imagine that’s what getting up to pee at night is like for men.\n\n\nSebil Engineering includes more than 40 levels of Lemmings-like carnage. It boasts “high detail traffic simulation” and “realistic civil engineering.” The trailers available support both of those bullet points.\n\n\nReal talk: I’ve got a lot of steam built up, and Sebil Engineering looks like a good way to let it out. I’m also in love with jank-pop, which is to say, games that look like they match the very worst examples from a bygone era.

The mod, developed and released on the Steam Workshop by user SoulCakeLive, comes packaged with 6 spells, a weapon, and an artifact meant to eviscerate your foes left and right. \n\n\n\n\n“As my way of celebrating the first anniversary of #SonicFrontiers, SUPER SONIC IS NOW PLAYABLE IN @OneStepFromEden!! This includes an outfit swap for Super Sonic 2!” SoulCakeLive said on Twitter.\n\n\nSuper Sonic’s spells available in this mod include:\n\n\n\nSuper Sonic Wind, a targeted wind ability that moves in a direct line to your opponent.\n\n\nSuper Homing Shot, which sends a barrage of attacks in varying directions.\n\n\nSuper Earth Crash, which halts enemies for 5 seconds.\n\n\nMaximum Avatar, which sends clones of Super Sonic to attack all enemies on the field.\n\n\nMach Burst, which allows you to teleport to an enemy, unleashing a damaging attack.\n\n\nTime Break, which stops time for 7 seconds and allows you to unleash heck on enemies.\n\n\n\nIn addition to these spells, this mod also includes a weapon, Super Sonic Boom, which bombards enemies with a non-stop volley of attacks; and an artifact, Chaos Emeralds, which allows players to recover 20HP every 10 seconds during battles.\n\n\n\n\nAlso, the mod comes with an outfit swap featuring the Super Sonic 2 design from Sonic Frontiers: The Final Horizon. So, it’s hardly your average asset swap mod, and is more akin to an additional, albeit unofficial, DLC pack for One Step From Eden. \n\n\n\n\nIt would appear this pack has even been noticed by the developer, Thomas Moon Kang. In a response to the original tweet by SoulCakeLive, the account for One Step From Eden replied with “That’s super cool.” \n\nThe post One Step From Eden mod adds Super Sonic as playable character appeared first on Destructoid.",

They were briefly restocked by iam8bit, but not many have managed to get one for themselves, as they have sold out in seconds. \n\n\nThe \"super limited batch\" of thermoses went on sale at 09:00 AM PT today and there wasn't much of a window available, as by 09:01 AM, they were already sold out. Understandably, this has resulted in a lot of upset fans who are once again left without a thermos. \n\n\nAs many on Reddit report, they were there as soon as the blue thermoses went live, but the stock was cleared before they could even finish processing payment. The frustration is compounded by the fact that prior runs were very limited and came with some pretty high shipping costs depending on where you live. Remedy's response hasn't helped calm the situation either. \n\n\n\n\nOn Twitter, many have already been complaining about how quickly the thermoses have sold out, with some suspecting that there may be bots scalping them so they can be resold at exorbitant prices. A Tweet from the studio's communications director Thomas Puha doesn't deny this, stating that it is \"common at popular merch drops and restaurant bookings where bots are often used to do the buying\" without giving any assurance that genuine buyers will be protected from scalpers clearing stock. \n\n\n\n\nFor those still itching to get their hands on one of the blue thermoses, you'll have to wait until a restock, which won't be coming until next year. \n\nThe post Alan Wake thermos sold out in seconds appeared first on Destructoid.",

He has a mostly positive outlook, as Inverse reports, and he imagines how generative AI can be used to improve NPCs. \n\n\nIf implemented correctly, it could give more variety to NPC dialogue. Zelnick argues that currently, scripted NPC dialogue can be quite boring, though with generative AI, \"you could imagine all the NPCs becoming really interesting and fun.\" The CEO believes that AI could be better than current solutions, though he is not so sure that it will be faster and cheaper. \n\n\nHe does not mention much about Grand Theft Auto 6, which has generated quite a bit of excitement this week with the announcement of an incoming trailer. Though he does confirm that the next game in the franchise is in development, he doesn't reveal additional information except that more news will come from Rockstar. We should get more information in December, which is when the trailer is due to drop. \n\n\nTake-Two's latest quarterly earnings report reveals that Rockstar's franchises are still going strong, with Red Dead Redemption 2 selling over 57 million and GTA 5 selling a stellar 190 million units.\n\nThe post Take-Two discusses how AI can be used to make NPCs “really interesting and fun” appeared first on Destructoid.",

Conceived as a \"semi-joke/novelty,\" the mod replaces all the enemies in classic Doom with the iconic Doctor Who robots.\n\n\nImage via ZuGineeris/ModDB.\n\n\nThe description says there are 20 varieties (including some rare ones) and over 400 sounds to boot.

          "description": "What's in a name? There are a lot of video game titles that just evoke memories or conjure up the idea of quality. Half-Life is just one example. However, Valve's first-ever game could easily have been called something else.\n\n\nIn a recent YouTube video from Valve level designer Dario Casali, it turns out Half-Life nearly wasn't called Half-Life at all. Casali begins his developer commentary – as part of the game's 25th anniversary celebrations – by showing a list of names that were suggested.\n\n\n\n\nOf the most popular ones, titles like \"Dirt,\" \"Lead,\" \"Pressure Chamber,\" \"Screwed,\" and even \"Bent\" were bandied around. Perhaps most interestingly, in a runners-up list, the word \"Fallout\" can be seen, along with \"Adrenaline,\" \"Unstable Element,\" and even just \"Death.\"\n\n\nWould have been a bit confusing\n\n\nWhat's also intriguing is that Half-Life is on this lower list, suggesting that it wasn't even a popular name being suggested. As a side note, Casali believes the team should have called it Screwed, adding that \"it would have been amazing.\"\n\n\nIt also would have been interesting if the studio had gone with Fallout. Considering the actual Fallout game came out a year before HL, there's a good chance there would have been some issues. Or at least some confusion.\n\n\nThe rest of this opening chapter of Casali's playthrough is pretty good as well. He gives a bit of insight into what the purpose of the iconic monorail opening was, aside from setting the scene. We take it for granted these days, but Valve really wanted to show off new technologies, such as light shafts, scripted sequences, and new skeletal models, and this intro was a way to show these things off.\n\nThe post Fun fact: Half-Life could well have been called ‘Fallout’ at one point appeared first on Destructoid.",

There's a distinct possibility that the Valve client could introduce a feature that will allow you to hide some of your more embarrassing choices.\n\n\nThat's according to a screenshot from SteamDB creator Pavel Djundik. The image shows a drop-down menu in Steam with an option to select \"Mark as Private.\" With such a feature, I can finally download Hatoful Boyfriend without fear of reprisal.\n\n\n\n\nOf course, it should be mentioned that, at the time of writing, this has yet to be confirmed. However, given that this comes from SteamDB – a third-party site that chronicles all things related to Steam – I'm hopeful it will come to fruition.\n\n\nNot here to judge\n\n\nThere are some, shall we say, less-than-chaste video games available through Steam's vast library of choices. As such, it seems pretty clear that the (potential) ability to hide certain ones from your friends is almost certainly motivated by the same reason Microsoft created an option to hide files and folders on Windows.\n\n\nThere is, after all, an Adults Only tag in the client, so it's not exactly a stretch to assume that – were such a feature to be implemented – there may be an uptick in people less shy about purchasing games of this nature. Whether it would also disable the pop-up that lets your friends know what you've just booted up remains to be seen.\n\n\nAs the head honcho of modern PC gaming, Steam is consistently being updated with everything from small backend tweaks to substantial UI overhauls.

Games. \n\n\nZaslav explains that gaming is the medium to focus on, as \"Gen Z and Gen Alpha prefer gaming to any other form of entertainment, more than social media, more than watching television or listening to music, more than going to the movie theater.\" \n\n\nGoing forward, the company plans to transform its biggest franchises from PC and console launches with three four-year release schedules to feature more \"always on gameplay through live services, multiplatform and free-to-play extensions.\" The ultimate aim is to have players spending more time on more platforms, which will in turn \"generate greater post-purchase revenue.\" \n\n\nHe points out that the com…",

          "description": "October 2019 saw the launch of action-platformer Valfaris, and now the sequel has a date. Side-scrolling shoot 'em up Valfaris: Mecha Therion is coming to PC on November 21, 2023, with consoles to follow later. \n\n\nDeveloper Steel Mantis is doing the best thing you can do to a protagonist with this one: Give them a massive robot. The story of Valfaris: Mecha Therion is pretty much covered in the subtitle. Therion continues his hunt for the evil Lord Vroll, only this time he takes the opportunity to bust out the secret weapon known as Mecha Therion. Thus, the follow-up is ready to fire away with a move from hectic, Contra-esque running and gunning to pure shooting action. \n\n\nYou can see how they changed things as Therion suits up in the release date trailer:\n\n\n\n\nIf the mighty sword he wields wasn't enough of a hint, there are still melee moves to master. Mecha Therion has Melee, Ballistic, and Destroyer class weapons, and your loadout can be configured with a variety of weapon combinations. Further add-ons and weapon upgrades are acquired by earning Blood Metal. \n\n\nIf the actual lore of Valfaris is something you can't resist, publisher Big Sugar Games promises a \"deeper dive\" in the days leading up to this month's launch. After its arrival on PC, Valfaris: Mecha Therion will make its way to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch sometime in 2024.  \n\nThe post Shoot ’em up sequel Valfaris: Mecha Therion hits PC this month, consoles in 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Gearbox Publishing celebrated 10 years of Risk of Rain today with an announcement for Risk of Rain: Hostile Worlds, a free-to-play action RPG roguelike for mobile devices.\n\n\nThe game looks to bring the usual fast-paced, run-and-gun combat of Risk of Rain to a new perspective. Hostile Worlds uses an isometric camera to display the action. The mobile RPG also embraces the new changes visually, showcasing a more cartoon-ish style with chibi-esque Survivors and perhaps even animated cutscenes. Gearbox notes that Hostile Worlds includes a lot of familiar characters and foes while staying true to the series' lore.\n\n\n\n\nRisk of Rain mobile charges into battle with more Survivors\n\n\nBeyond the look and new angle, the big takeaway is that this mobile Risk of Rain will let you swap characters on the fly. The game lets you pick three Survivors you can change while in \"mid-combat to exploit enemy vulnerabilities.\" It sounds like your odds of survival will only improve by unlocking the best Survivors who complement your team's playstyle. There will also be co-op support for you and up to three others. \n\n\nBut even that might not help. The publisher promises that Risk of Rain: Hostile Worlds will still be pretty tough with \"heart-pounding bullet-hell gameplay\" and \"colossal adversaries.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNaturally, since this is a F2P mobile game, there will be some live-service trappings. Neither Gearbox nor developer Frima Games makes mention of what their free-to-play model looks like yet. But the game will feature \"continuous\" updates to keep \"the fun rolling.\" I expect we'll see new Survivors and items getting piped into some in-game store. Gearbox hasn't yet revealed any costs, and the game's release date is still up in the air.\n\n\nThere is a website, though, and signing up for the newsletter will unlock a Survivor called Mercenary during the game's launch. Risk of Rain: Hostile Worlds will be available on iOS and Android mobile devices.\n\nThe post Risk of Rain is getting an F2P action RPG on mobile appeared first on Destructoid.",

Thankfully, the latest update for Marvel's Spider-Man 2 fixes some troublesome clipping issues and a bug that could corrupt your save file.\n\n\nThe latter issue is clearly the larger concern. Thankfully, according to the notes released by developer Insomniac Games, the bug appears only in a very specific situation. And there's only one such bug listed with the update. A majority of the fixes cover collision problems, getting stuck on objects, or clipping through or into things. For some, Spider-Man would warp through the ground like Nightcrawler and fall forever into the screaming void. The patch should hopefully fix it. Hopefully.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nSpider-Man 2 update fixes the infamous 'Spider-Box' once again\n\n\nThe Spider-Man 2 update includes five fixes for clipping issues. It addresses situations where you can get stuck while running on a wall or clip through the world while in combat. There's also a fix for one issue that I had to deal with. While playing the Coney Island story mission, I had Peter Parker sit on a bench that must have been coated with glue. He wouldn't stand up, and I had to restart a checkpoint. If this happened to you, the update should fix it. \n\n\nThe patch also corrects the model-loading issue, of which the character turns into a white box. And if you've checked the game's subreddit, the bug is not as uncommon as you'd think. It may have even happened once to yours truly. \n\n\nI had fun with it. Screenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThere are other issues addressed by the update. Missions should no longer randomly fail if you have the HUD removed. The game should also count the number of correct flips if you're going for the Hang Ten trophy. Check out the full list to learn more.\n\nThe post Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 update addresses clipping issues and save corruption bug appeared first on Destructoid.",

The first season hit the subscription streaming service in November of 2021and now we know that Arcane Season 2 hits Netflix this time next year. \nMore specifically, Arcane Season 2 drops onto Netflix in November of 2024.

That said, it will also be available on iPads and Macs with the M1 chip or later. If you're a diehard Apple fan and have multiple RE4 Remake compatible products, you'll be happy to know that the game also supports cross-progression between Apple devices, so you can start a save file on your Mac at home and pick it up on your phone when you're on the go.\nThe game is available for pre-order on the App Store now, but players will be able to start the game for free before committing to a full purchase. Its recently released DLC, Separate Ways, will launch alongside it as well.

After a recent patch a few weeks ago that made the game easier and added in some Halloween festivity, developer Hexworks and publisher CI Games have released its schedule of content for the game and it includes new questlines, two new events, more armor and weapons, and more. \nThe roadmap also includes a \"regular weekly cadence of updates focusing on bringing further stability, performance optimization, and balancing improvements to the game, including its online crossplay experience.\" \n\n\nStopping short of specifics, Hexworks says before the year's end, it will add multiple new quest lines to Lords of the Fallen, with the opportunity to unlock some unique armor sets and weapons. The studio says some of this armor and weaponry has been co-created with the community during recent collaborative livestreams. Plus, the studio says \"players can look forward to 12 new spells, new finisher attacks, and a whole host of community-requested features, including the recently revealed New Game Plus (NG+) modifier system – a first for the genre, and highly anticipated by the Lords of the Fallen community.\" \n\"At Hexworks, we're incredibly proud of the open relationship we're fostering with our community,\" studio head Saül Gascon writes in a press release. \"We are actively listening to their constructive feedback and working diligently to deliver what we believe, collectively, will elevate Lords of the Fallen further. Every addition to the game is a labor of love, as we strive to push both it and the genre's boundaries.\"\nFor more, read Game Informer's Lords of the Fallen review and then listen to us talk about it on The Game Informer Show. \nHave you played Lords of the Fallen?

It did so thanks to great software sales for new first-party games released this year like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Pikmin 4. \nThis news comes from Nintendo's Fiscal Year 2024 second quarter financial results, which ended September 30. In it, we learn the Switch has officially reached 132.46 million units sold, getting it closer to the company's best-selling hardware, the Nintendo DS at 154.02 million units sold.

That means users will no longer be able to directly upload screenshots and video clips from the console to the social media site.\nAn announcement update posted to the PlayStation Support page states that on Monday, November 13, X integration will end, which includes the ability to “view any content published on X on PS5/PS4, and the ability to post and view content, trophies, and other gameplay-related activities on X directly from PS5/PS4 (or link an X account to do so).”\nWhile a bummer for those who make frequent use of this feature, which offers a simple method of posting gameplay content to the platform, there are a couple of more involved alternatives depending on your platform. If you’re a PS5 user, you can still use the PlayStation mobile app to upload gameplay captures to then post on X. You can read how to do that here. PS4 users have to rely on ShareFactory and do a bit more work, and you can read those steps here.\nMicrosoft made the same move in April by disabling sharing to X directly from the console and instructing players to instead use the Xbox app on mobile (with some speculating the decision was made to avoid paying the platform's then-new monthly application programming interface (API) fee). This now means that the Switch will become the sole console that supports direct media sharing to X. \nWhat do you think about the decision to end X integration? Did you use this feature regularly?

Humanity's story reflects real-world events, showing us the paths we're currently on.\nWatch The Documentary:\n\n\n\"Soon after we began making Humanity, a number of big events and movements broke out around the world,\" Enhance founder and CEO Tetsuya Mizuguchi tells us. \"There were human rights movements, the Hong Kong protests, [and] then there was the pandemic. And war soon followed in Ukraine. We had no idea how quickly and deeply AI would infiltrate our society either. I think all these things found their way into the core of Humanity. That question, for example, 'What is humanity? What is human nature?' We would often talk about how people, looked at individually, are good. There are so many wonderful people out there. But when they become a group, or a nation, or even just big groups, at that level, something happens. It's like a different switch gets flipped. And what you see there, that is what we're trying to depict in Humanity.\"\nWatch above or over on Game Informer's YouTube channel to see the full documentary about the making of Humanity. \"Violence Is Inevitable\" speaks to the core creative team, including Mizuguchi and tha creative director Yugo Nakamura, about the project's origins, its complications and lengthy development cycle, and how it came to show us the nature of humanity.",

Spider-Man sees the friendly neighborhood hero battle a star-studded gallery of villains in an original adventure chock full of comic book goodness.

          "description": "Earlier this year, HBO's The Last of Us successfully brought developer Naughty Dog's critically acclaimed and fan-favorite PlayStation exclusive to life on the TV screen. Its Season 1 premiere was HBO's second-largest debut since 2010, and its second episode broke records, too. Roughly three weeks after the premiere of the series, HBO revealed The Last of Us would be getting a second season. And now, thanks to a new Deadline report, we know it will start shooting next year and premiere sometime in 2025. \nDeadline learned this at a New York news event, where HBO boss Casey Bloys reportedly told press that Season 2 will head into production early next year, aiming for a 2025 premiere. Unfortunately, that's all Bloys said about the season. But, as noted by Deadline, series co-creator and executive producer Craig Mazin revealed earlier this summer pre-strike that the team was already able to get some work done, adding that the first episode was already written. \n\n\n\"We got pretty far actually, we were doing great,\" Mazin told Deadline. \"[The Last of Us game co-creator Neil Druckmann] and I had been sitting and talking with [The Last of Us Part II co-writer Halley Gross] and Bo Shim, the new writer that was in our little tiny room with us – obviously not a mini room because we're greenlit proper, we're a real show, and because I hate that mini room stuff.\"\nConsidering the first season of The Last of Us covered the events of the first Last of Us game, including its Left Behind DLC, it's clear Season 2 of the show will dive into The Last of Us Part II. We're all still awaiting some casting announcements, like who will play Abby and Lev, but that likely won't happen until the actor and writer strikes are over. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's The Last of Us Part 1 review and then read our review of The Last of Us Part II. \n[Source: Deadline]\nHow far into The Last of Us Part II do you think Season 2 will go?

Sometimes Yoshi showed up in The Legend of Zelda, and Kirby was whatever color he felt like at the moment, be it gray or pink. In 1996, that laissez-faire attitude was in full effect for the release of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars for the Super Nintendo. Link, Samus, and even Donkey Kong (sort of) all had inexplicable cameos in the game, and one of my big questions about the remake was whether or not those would move forward. If you're ready to learn the answer for at least some of them, read on!\nImpressively, the answer is yes! At least for Link and Donkey Kong. I have not been able to play to the point in the game where Samus appears, so I can't answer that question yet. When you get close to Link after seeing him in the sleeping bed, a \"talk\" option appears, and when you click it, a Zelda musical sting plays.\nDonkey Kong's cameo has always been questionable as to whether or not it is him, as he is just labeled \"Guerilla\", but he sure looks a lot like Donkey Kong, just with a crown.\n\nThe Super Mario RPG remake releases November 17 for Nintendo Switch.\nPurchase",

That has since come and gone, with players eagerly awaiting the second part of this expansion. And now, the official Pokémon Twitter account has revealed The Indigo Disk DLC goes live next month. \n\n\nMore specifically, The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero Part 2: The Indigo Disk hits Pokémon Scarlet and Violet on December 14. As those keeping up with Game Freak's ninth generation of Pokémon know, The Indigo Disk brings players to Blueberry Academy, which is actually in the Unova region, rather than the Paldea region where Pokémon Scarlet and Violet take place. The Unova region is the setting for Pokémon Black and White, and their sequels, Pokémon Black 2 and White 2. \nPokémon Scarlet or Pokémon Violet The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero Part 2: The Indigo Disk launches on December 14!\n#PokemonScarletViolet ❤️💜 pic.twitter.com/IljDHdTUeq\nNovember 2, 2023\nMany players are speculating that The Indigo Disk will, in some way, tease remakes of the fifth generation of Pokémon, as those are next in line for Game Freak's cadence of remaking previously released Pokémon games. With players leaving Paldea to check out an academy in Unova, many predict some hint at potential Pokémon Black and White remakes await trainers. But only time will tell. \nPokémon Scarlet and Violet: The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero Part 2 – The Indigo Disk hits the games on December 14. The DLC can be purchased as a pack for $34.99. \nFor more, read about how after The Indigo Disk is out, every starter Pokémon will be available in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, and then read Game Informer's Pokémon Scarlet and Violet review. \nAre you hopping into The Indigo Disk next month?

After securing his freedom, Edward finds his brother missing and strange documents \"blackened by a language he innately understands.\" \n\"No one knows where these occult-looking symbols came from, but Edward has seen such writings before: in the workshop of an enigmatic wise man among the Vikings who is part of a secret order: Those Unseen,\" a press release reads. \"An order that could offer answers to Edward, and guarantee his aspirations of freedom and knowledge. But with that knowledge, can he find and rescue his own brother before it's too late?\"\nUbisoft senior transmedia content manager Etienne Bouvier says the company is lucky to work with Gabella and Traisci as they are two long-standing fans of the Assassin's Creed franchise who infused their love of it, and knowledge of its lore, into this book. \nAssassin's Creed Valhalla: The Hidden Codex hits bookshelves and online retailers on April 30, 2024, before it hits comic book stores on May 1. It is available for preorder now and costs $19.99. \nFor more about the series, read Game Informer's Assassin's Creed Valhalla review and then read our Assassin's Creed Mirage review.

It's a cartoon FMV game, with an inventory, in which you have to guide Lathan Kandor through a medieval world, discovering the magic spells and the items required to defeat an evil wizard. \nEscape From Hell, was developed for Electronic Arts by the game veterans Richard Seaborne and Alan Murphy and was released in 1990. You play Alan in this keyboard-only Role Playing Game and visit Hell, looking for your girlfriend who was accidentally teleported there.\nBoth games use heavily hardcoded logic which is error prone and requires a lot of testing, so we need your feedback more than ever as they are both incompletely tested. There is sadly only one known demo for Kingdom. Support for the Windows and Mac versions of Kingdom may come later! Please contact us if you have some other demos of both games.\nTo play any of these games, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker and please take some screenshots along the way!\n>",
