          "description": "My kingdom for a unicorn.\nHow do you follow up a game like 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim? Before that ambitious, phenomenal sci-fi adventure, developer Vanillaware found its niche in creating rich, beautiful-looking worlds with a magical, medieval twist. Sometimes it was traditional Western fantasy, while others it jumped back to Edo Japan. Unicorn Overlord marks the developer’s return to the former, taking place in a fantasy realm overtaken by an evil lord. That sounds like the exact opposite of 13 Sentinels’ winding plot, but Unicorn Overlord is ambitious in an entirely different way. It’s also absolutely brilliant, effortlessly blending multiple systems to create a wonderful tactical RPG with a twist.\nAt the start of the game, you witness the fall of the Kingdom of Cornia thanks to a revolt led by General Valmore. At the same time, the young prince Alain flees the kingdom with the Holy Knight Josef, to ensure the bloodline survives. The revolt, however, is successful, and the Zenioran Army rises up and gradually overtakes all five nations of Valmore. Ten years later, Alain returns to build a liberation army to take back his kingdom and restore order to the continent of Fevrith.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Hey, everybody. Want to kill all humans?\nThere is no shortage of terrible things buried deep underground, but, in Ancient Weapon Holly, you get to be the worst of them. This roguelike from Acquire, one of the studios behind the Octopath Traveler series, puts you in control of a powerful robot that seeks revenge on the humans that buried it for thousands of years. Reaching the surface and killing all humans will take a bit longer than you’d expect, though.\nAt first glance, Ancient Weapon Holly is a serviceable, fun, action-packed roguelite. The game consists of ten levels to play through, each one increasing in difficulty. Holly starts with a basic ranged attack and the ability to open up pits in the floor for enemies to fall into. These can be closed up to instantly kill most enemies, particularly once you’ve upgraded your attack power through the game’s version of a sphere grid. It is an interesting mechanic and the combat is chaotic enough to keep you interested for a few hours, but the game’s lack of depth makes it feel repetitive long before Holly reaches the surface.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Towards the conclusion, one NPC is selected as \"Beloved\" and promptly abducted by a dragon for you to quest forth and rescue. There are a few characters who are positioned more obviously as romanceables, but the brilliance of the system is that you can raise your Affinity with pretty much anybody. If you want to finish the game staring passionately into the eyes of the court jester or that hearty bloke who runs the armour shop, it's within your power.\r\n \nRead more",

But, more importantly, you can now hide single, selected games from your library, so your friends can't see when you're playing them - or even that you own them. Obviously the first thing that comes to mind is that this could usher in a new dawn of secret perverts able to hide their embarrassing 3D sex games, but are there other use cases for it? We discuss on this week's podcast. Plus: we've been playing current games! Cheese! And some more booze recommendations from James!\nRead more",

          "description": "Zoria: Age Of Shattering speedruns its fantasy RPG origin story in a quick cutscene montage at the start, so we might as well get that out of the way first, too. Low fantasy world, two warring kingdoms, one uses necromancy (this is cast as bad and cheating rather than practical, for some reason) to comprehensively gain the upper hand, and everything is named like a bunch of Scrabble letters were thrown randomly on the table. You play Elion war hero Captain Witherel - gender and class TBD by the player - in a small group making a final stand at the fortress Daeg Marastir, which is being overrun by the nefarious Izirian army. We start in media bellum, as it were.\nThis first stage, where you escape the fortress, gives you a whistle-stop tour of the main systems in the game. You control a squad of four, the combat is turn-based, you can pitch camp at any time to rest and heal up, and there are crafting systems for potions, food and gear. Zoria isn't really remaking the wheel as much as it is taking spokes from a bunch of other fantasy RPGs you like, and the result is the terrier of RPGs. Small, clearly has a lot of different DNA knocking around in there, and punches above its weight, but it's a bit scrappy and sometimes it's knees dislocate and it falls over. This terrier was made by three people, so that is sort of to be expected.\nRead more",

          "description": "Since the summer of 2020, Unknown 9: Awakening has only existed as a 90-second cinematic teaser trailer. In it, a young girl called Haroona is chased through the narrow streets of Calcutta by a rabble of boys armed with sticks. It's not clear why she's attracted their ire, but as one moves to strike her, a shockwave pulses out from her small body, the world turns grey, and time slows down. As she deftly moves out of harm's way, she turns back to look at her stunned onlookers, a confident smirk rising on her face.\nIt was a striking, if utterly ambiguous debut, and with talk of accompanying podcasts, books, comics and a web series also on the way to help build out this new world even further, it felt like developers Reflector Entertainment were really setting out to make a bold and ambitious first impression. But it's now been four years since that trailer. The books, podcasts and comics have all come and gone, seemingly making little impression, and Awakening, the game aiming to pull this big, expanded universe together, has arguably slipped from both time and memory. Perhaps this will change with its newly-dated summer 2024 release window on the horizon, but having seen a small, hands-off slice of an early mission in the game at publisher Bandai Namco's offices a couple of weeks ago, Awakening's certainly got its work cut out for it.\nRead more",

The second was to royally screw myself by fielding a party consisting exclusively of magic-users. \r\n\n\r\nIn Dragon’s Dogma 2 as in Dragon’s Dogma 1, you lead a gang of up to three AI-controlled \"pawn\" characters – one permanent main sidekick who levels up alongside you, plus two auxiliary pawns created by other players, who are either summoned at Rift stones or spawned into the open world as hired help. As in most RPGs, the ideal party setup is a mix of pure melee, ranged and magical DPS or support classes, but given the whimsicality of Dragon’s Dogma’s sorcery, with its levitation spells and lightning whips, I’ve always wanted to try a whole playthrough as a posse of unescorted occultists.\nRead more",

Speed is, ultimately, the modus operandi of a car. It gets you where you need to go faster than a horse, and doesn't do annoying things like pooing on your patio or dying (also, potentially, on your patio). Surely, then, playing a game about cars moving at the speed of a dead patio horse defeats the point, like playing a first-person shooter where all the guns fire backwards.\r\n\n\nExpeditions: A Mudrunner Game demonstrates this not to be the case. This bouncy, slimy off-roading simulator is the most fun I've had with an imaginary car since 2018's Jalopy. This is partly because it is as much a physics puzzler filled with limitless conundrums as it is a game about driving, but also because, like Jalopy, it envisions the car as something more than a way to boost egos by doing a big circle.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Two universal conveniences: your shopping basket is now shared across devices, so no losing track of things you meant to buy later; and buying gift copies is now less faffy. More conditional: you can now choose to make individual games private, meaning no one will ever see if you own them or are playing them. I won't ask why you might want to hide any particular games.\nRead more",

          "description": "When we first meet The Thaumaturge's hero Wiktor Szulski, we're told he's a man cursed by the vice of pride. It's a trait that sits at the heart of his personality, and in this particular alt-history telling of Polish turmoil in Warsaw at the turn of the twentieth century, such 'Flaws' can also attract the attention of otherworldly beings called Salutors - vicious creatures of myth and folklore who follow their quarry around like dark and gloomy shadows, amplifying their worst qualities and, in many cases, driving them to emotional, and often violent, extremes. It's these outbursts that Wiktor will be investigating over the course of this curious detective RPG from the makers of Seven: The Days Long Gone and the upcoming The Witcher 1 Remake, as fortunately for him, Wiktor comes from a long line of storied Salutor tamers, his thaumaturgic know-how allowing him to see these monsters made flesh, exorcise them from their human host, and use them for his own gains.\nHe's a man that's ultimately made peace with his own arrogance, then, but considering everything he goes through during The Thaumaturge's 25 hour-odd run-time, I reckon his pride is pretty justified. Not only is he able to brush off multiple stab and gunshot wounds and clubs to the face when he gets in a fight, but he also achieves several feats of thaumaturgy that we're repeatedly told are thought to be nigh on impossible. Indeed, at the start of this game, his connection with his original Salutor Upyr is hanging by a thread, his worst instincts having got the best of him in a recent attempt to tame and capture a second beast from the ether. By the end, however, I had six Salutors at my beck and call, out of a total of eight. Wiktor is very much a force to be reckoned with, and he makes for a highly compelling lead as you navigate the branching storylines in Warsaw's political hotbed.\nRead more",

There's a meteor scheduled to slamdunk the planet in 30 days, and in that time, you and your fellow players must progress from raising log cabins in the woods to building the means to develop technologies that might somehow avert the apocalypse. The trouble is, pioneering said apocalypse-averting technologies might itself bring about disaster in a gameworld that simulates things like habitat death, species extinction, air pollution and catastrophic flooding. \r\n\n\r\nPlayers must thus walk a careful line between resource exploitation and self-inflicted calamity by monitoring their impact on the overall simulation, founding the right kind of government, and passing laws or devising economies (including player-created currencies) that don't flip the ecosystem upside down. The Steam reviews teem with anecdotes about people waking up to find their oil wells underwater, and it sounds like things will only get knottier when Eco releases out of early access around the end of this year.\r\n\n \nRead more",

When I finally saw the sun again, I could have cried.\nIt’s still a bit wonky, but the full 1.0 release makes the Forest a fuller, livelier and more inviting (or else alluringly off-putting) prospect for a wander - even, as in my case, a wholly solo one.

          "description": "You may have noticed that SSDs got extremely cheap towards the end of 2023, and then they rebounded somewhat in 2024. We normally expect better deals at Black Friday than during the rest of the year, but this is something a bit different, with oversupply in 2023 leading to significant reductions that aren't likely to be repeated in 2024. However, there are still some better deals than others, and unless you can hop in a time machine they're still well worth covering. \nThe subject of today's deals post is the Kingston KC3000, an SSD that I use in my own testing PC thanks to its high capacity, impressive PCIe 4.0 speeds and generally aggressive pricing. Today you can pick up the 2TB KC3000 for £123, a fair price for a drive that cost more than £150 at the start of 2024. \nRead more",

He and his fellow co-founder Ben Driscoll had just spent a week playing Daniel Mullins' mysterious roguelike deckbuilder Inscryption at the end of October 2021, but the combination of a bad storm and a power outage ended up forcing Guerra to decamp from his home in Massachusetts and stay with some family until it all blew over. \"I got back late on Halloween, just in time to put out a bowl of candy for some kids, and then the next morning we started Cobalt Core,\" he tells me.\nThe pair had been working on a range of different prototypes in the months leading up to this lightbulb moment. As development on their debut game, the spaceship building puzzler Sunshine Heavy Industries, began winding down, \"we were throwing all kinds of stuff at the wall,\" he says, including games in 3D, a platformer, with Driscoll revealing they even had \"a Terraria-like one for a couple of weeks\" with a grid-based world that characters bounced around in. But it was playing Inscryption that brought everything to a head. Both had spent hundreds of hours with Slay The Spire, but \"Inscryption proved to us that there was still a lot of space to explore in the genre,\" says Guerra. And with increasing calls from Sunshine Heavy Industries players begging them to let them fly the ships they were creating in its shipyard sandbox, \"you can kind of see how that went from A to B\".\nRead more",

Yesterday, when he announced to everyone at EA that a bunch of them were losing their jobs (again), he first spent three paragraphs talking about how EA is doing great, leading the industry, getting increasing engagement from fans, optimising their global footprint and sunsetting games oh yep, there it is, that's the \"you're about to be unemployed\" language right there.

Yet, here we are, three years and more than a dozen developer vlogs since TallBoys' surreal runaway sim first captured everyone's attention (including one state-owned Russian news channel). If not for its Kafkaesque premise, which pits players against a ten-story tall looming policeman in a quest to escape a small town, then definitely because of the game’s ambitious voice recognition feature that promised real-time conversation instead of pre-written dialogue.\nRead more",

I cannot remember for the life of me which level(s) it contained. My only surviving memory of it is having quite a good time blasting Stormtroopers and the chaps in black with the swoopy, knock-off Vader helmets, but also getting terribly lost and not really knowing what the heck I was meant to be doing. Now, playing Nightdive Studio's Star Wars: Dark Forces Remaster as an adult probably close to three decades later, both these feelings have come roaring back, as this is very much a Star Wars FPS in the vein of Doom and other early 90s shooters (thumbs up). But it's one that leans so hard into its maze-like level design that it can regularly feel like a little bit of a tough hang in the cold hard light of 2024 (thumbs down).\nCrucially, though, not to the point where it's best left consigned to the history books. This is still an enjoyable and worthwhile artefact in Star Wars' PC gaming history, and if your eyes (and general patience levels) can't quite stomach the 'Classic' and still available 1995 original, then this remaster is a pin-sharp glow-up for modern hardware.\nRead more",

All of them were available elsewhere, but finally, they’re available on the PC’s biggest digital storefront.\n\n\nA lot of these are from Bullfrog, one of the many studios that EA shuttered, but there’s also the Command & Conquer - The Ultimate Collection, which features some games from Westwood, another studio that EA shuttered.\n\n\nHere’s the list:\n\n\n\nCommand & Conquer - The Ultimate Collection\n\n\nSimCity 3000 Unlimited\n\n\nPopulous\n\n\nPopulous 2: Trials of the Olympic Gods\n\n\nPopulous: The Beginning\n\n\nDungeon Keeper Gold\n\n\nDungeon Keeper 2\n\n\nSid Meier’s Alpha Centauri Planetary Pack\n\n\nThe Saboteur\n\n\n\nThat’s a coincidence! I’ve been working on something involving Command & Conquer, and while doing my research, discovered The Ultimate Collection. I saw that it was available on the “EA App” (formerly Origin), and that’s as far as I went in that direction because I’m not installing the EA App. Now I don’t have to! Phew. But that’s neat since I just discovered its existence today while I was looking up if you could still buy Command & Conquer Renegade.\n\n\nAside from that, everything else was available on GOG, and I already own most of them on that list, but not Command & Conquer - The Ultimate Collection.\n\n\nIf it sounds like I’m being flippant, it’s because EA is one of the worst companies when it comes to preserving their back catalog. SimCity 3000 is here, but do you know what isn’t available? The original SimCity. Most of what they made back in the ‘80s and ‘90s might as well not exist to them.\n\n\nBut credit where it’s due. You can now buy the listed EA games on Steam. That’s not nothing. Maybe they're going to pay better respect to their old classics, but I'll believe it when I see it.\n\n\nThe games are available right now, and they're all discounted quite considerably for a limited time.\n\nThe post Long overdue, EA finally releases some of its classic games on Steam appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Look, I'm a simple dude. I just want fun and cool stuff. And it looks like Overwatch 2 is getting just that with a Cowboy Bebop collaboration event. The event starts March 12 and features skins, emotes, and more from the space bounty hunter anime. Music from the series will be featured in-game as well. The below trailer is all it took for me to click the Install button for Overwatch 2 on my Battle.net launcher for the first time in over a year.\n\n\n\n\nI'll admit, I didn't see this coming. But I'm oh so glad it is. Cowboy Bebop is one of my favorite animes ever. Well, the original, of course, not the live-action Netflix thing. And while I never really considered an Overwatch collab with the series, it's actually...quite perfect.\n\n\nHere are all the confirmed Cowboy Bebop Legendary Skins coming to Overwatch 2 in the collab:\n\n\n\nSpike Spiegel Cassidy\n\n\nFaye Valentine Ashe\n\n\nJet Black Mauga\n\n\nEd Sombra\n\n\nEin Wreckingball\n\n\n\nThe Ein Wreckinball skin will be available to all players for free.\n\n\nI didn't see myself reinstalling Overwatch 2, at least not any time soon. So great job Blizzard, you've achieved that. Now don't let me down, let's keep the cool stuff coming. After all, that's all I want with Overwatch 2, is to have a fun time!\n\n\nThe Overwatch 2 and Cowboy Bebop collab event goes live on March 12 on all platforms. \n\nThe post Overwatch 2 is getting a Cowboy Bebop collab so I’m reinstalling Overwatch 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The bout continues as Nvidia and AMD butt heads in the arena of \"Graphics Card Supremacy\" (it's painfully obvious I know nothing about boxing). I mean, they're both huge tech conglomerates, so it's not as if Dr. Lisa Su and Jensen Huang fight it out school playground-style. Still, we're seeing an ongoing battle as the price of mid-range GPUs takes a dive.\n\n\nAs reported by Tom's Hardware, a number of products from Team Red and Team Green are becoming cheaper, to the point of being quite affordable, finally. In particular, it's those middle-of-the-road cards that may be within reach for some of us, hopefully leaving the 'mid-range GPU the price of an enthusiast GPU' behind. \n\n\nFor example: the Nvidia RTX 4060 Ti 16GB from MSI is as low as $419 on Newegg. Though that's after a $20 rebate and using a promo code. Same with the AMD Radeon RX 7700 XT, which has been sighted as low as $409. Again, promo codes will help get you to the bottom end of the price.\n\n\nHow low can you go?\n\n\nThere's an argument to be had that these graphics cards – both of which are more mid-range – could stand to be a little cheaper. The 16GB variant of the RTX 4060 Ti was about $100 more expensive than its 8GB predecessor when it first launched. This is despite it being the exact same card, just with more VRAM.\n\n\nA report from PC Gamer seems to agree that these models could fall below the $400 mark, which would probably make them more appealing.\n\n\nAnyone who's tried to build a custom PC using modern hardware knows how expensive it is. Not everyone is rich enough to be lumped into the \"enthusiast\" category, so to see some fairly decent GPUs having their prices slashed feels like a step in the right direction.\n\nThe post Nvidia and AMD mid-range GPU prices keep tumbling, hopefully on the way to under $400 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "For some reason, the Fallout Teaser Trailer that dropped a few months ago just didn't really resonate with me. The strong points of the IP, its post-apocalyptic world and intriguing \"wild west\" style narrative were missing from the mainly b-roll teaser. However, Amazon just released a new over 3-minute long trailer for the show and it looks a lot more like the Fallout I know.\n\n\n\n\nEverything that felt missing from the teaser is actually front and center in this new trailer. We start with a look at life inside the vault, which looks half comfy and half dystopia. You know, your typical Fallout vault. We also get a look at some of the characters. First is Ella Purnell who plays Jean, a vault dweller who leaves the safety of the vault for the first time. In the trailer, her character appears cautiously optimistic about life on the surface, which is more or less how I felt leaving the vault for the first time in Fallout 3, though it didn't last long.\n\n\nThen there's Walton Goggins who plays the Ghoul. The trailer actually starts by showing him before the nuclear war, as a vault salesman which fits. Then as a Ghoul, he appears to be the sarcastic carefree selfish character we'd expect from a Ghoul.\n\n\nWe also get a look at plenty of subtle yet \"Fallout-esque\" features throughout. Like a medical robot assuring Jean, \"I'm simply going to harvest your organs!\" Yep, it's Fallout.\n\n\nOf course, I'll save my full judgment for when the series actually drops. But I can say I'm more optimistic that this will be a genuine Fallout story rather than the IP serving only as a name to the story like the recent Halo series.\n\n\nAll episodes of Fallout will become available for streaming on April 11, which is right around the corner!\n\nThe post New Fallout TV show trailer drops, looks like it could actually be good appeared first on Destructoid.",

Still, the developer is determined to keep the metaphorical motor running, and the latest update for the game is now out in Steam Beta.\n\n\nOne thing to note about the patch notes is the sheer number of \"fixes\" that have been implemented. In fact, in a recent post on The-X-Formerly-Known-As-Twitter, version 1.10.30 of Starfield has over 400 things that have been fixed. Bethesda games, amirite? Also, just to reiterate: this is just for Steam Beta. The final patch will be rolling out for PC and Xbox sometime after.\n\n\n\n\nSome other things that have been added in the new update: new camera mode expressions, support for changing FOV in \"3rd Person Ship view,\" autosave when fast traveling back into orbit, and some general quality-of-life improvements.\n\n\nWhat about some new content?\n\n\nHundreds of fixes are obviously a good thing, but a lot of people will be more interested in some new content for the game. We've recently gotten wind that the Shattered Space DLC could be arriving soon. That might see an uptick in general interest.\n\n\nWe all know the story.

          "description": "Weappy Wholesome (!?) is showing off its upcoming movie-making sim, Hollywood Animal, with a deep dive into its gameplay systems. Oh my gosh…\n\n\nThe trailer, entitled “How To Make a Quick Buck With a Shameless Sequel,” is framed like it’s just going to show you how to make a sequel. It starts out simply representing the vapid nature of constant, creatively devoid sequels that are the foundation of the movie industry. Then, the seven-minute clip just gets darker and darker.\n\n\n\n\nThe slide begins with the demonstration of having a writer add “torture in captivity” as a plot device. Before you know it, the narrator is talking you through kidnapping a movie star and forcing them to play a role in the movie. Then the director has his third heart attack. In order to allow the movie to stand out at release, the narrator suggests bribing the police to raid rival studios in an effort to delay their projects.\n\n\nThen, when you think it can’t get any more unscrupulous, the trailer walks you through calling in a favor from the Ku Klux Klan to have them promote the film within their ranks. To top it all off, the narrator then insults the audience, insinuating that they’re just a bunch of sheep.\n\n\nWell then.\n\n\nHollywood Animal is one of my most anticipated games this year. I’m somewhat worried if the execution will live up to the promise, but if the trailer is anything to go by, it just might. Really, just watching the trailer, I see a lot of math going on in the back end.

In Sphere of Influence, rapid technological and societal changes of the Victoria Era allows empires to compete in new lands and with new means. The expansion has a handful of new features including the ability to create your own Power Bloc and then bully, bribe, or befriend other nations to get them to join.\n\n\n\n\nThe Great Game\n\n\nSphere of Influence also focuses on The Great Game, a 19th-century rivalry between the British and Russian empires over influence in Central Asia. Players can use Prestige to become a Great Power and create their own Power Bloc, from which they can dominate other nations in diplomatic arrangements or use the bloc to pursue common economic or ideological goals.\n\n\nPlayers also have the opportunity to play as any of the powers central to The Great Game conflict, including Persia and Afghanistan. The map has been redrawn to highlight the many competing interests during The Great Game.\n\n\nOther features of Sphere of Influence include Foreign Investments, Nationalization, Subject Interactions, Interest Group Lobbies, and many more systems built around the new Power Bloc feature.\n\n\nI've got about 30 or so hours in Victoria 3so far and have been waiting for an update like this to jump back in. The ability to ccreate a Power Bloc will really change up the strategies you can use to effectively grow your empire, and I'm excited to see how it all works.\n\n\nTo celebrate the news, a Trains Bonus Content Pack with ten new 3D models for trains from the early days of steam to the golden age of rail is available to download for free for anyone who owns Victoria 3.\n\n\nVictoria 3: Sphere of Influence is set to release on PC on May 6, 2024 for $29.99.\n\nThe post Victoria 3: Sphere of Influence expansion focuses on The Great Game, releases in May appeared first on Destructoid.",

These debates are often full of superfluous apples-to-oranges comparisons and, as a result, are unlikely to come up with a definitive answer everyone will be happy with. But that's what makes them so fun. In that spirit, we're taking the month of March to hold our own bracket-style tournament, voted on by readers, to determine the greatest video game of all time.\nThough we here at Game Informer assembled the bracket, even that was heavily influenced by our Reader Vote we held in 2018 to coincide with our 300th issue. Using the results of our 2018 Reader Vote combined with some input from staff, general sentiment in various online communities, and critical reception for more recent games, we assembled a starting bracket of 64 games. From here, we'll hold two rounds of voting per week until we whittle this field down to one ultimate winner.\nWill this result in a definitive selection of the best game ever released? Or will it reveal a coordinated effort from a particular gaming community committed to seeing their favorite game rise through the ranks? Only time will tell. \nWhile this is meant to be a fun experiment to see how the results shake out within the Game Informer readership and community, we hope you'll come back to root for your favorites every Monday and Thursday until we are able to crown our champion in the 2024 Game Gauntlet.

Not only did it bring a mafia-themed season to the battle royale aspect of Fortnite, with a new battle pass too, but it introduced three new ways to play the game: Fortnite Festival, a Rock Band-like experience developed by Harmonix, Lego Fortnite, a Minecraft-like survival experience, and Rocket Racing, a racing game developed by Rocket League studio Psyonix.\nAs Season 1 of Chapter 5 reaches its closing hours, Epic Games has revealed the next season is called Myths & Mortals, promising a Greek Mythology-themed season with skins of gods and goddesses and more. \nPrepare thyselves, mere mortals!\npic.twitter.com/0d91p34hCu\nMarch 7, 2024\nUnfortunately, the above announcement and accompanying image is all we have so far of Fortnite Chapter 5: Season 2, but there's plenty to discover in this teaser alone. It seems like the there's a comedic Poseidon skin on the left, and a Hades skin in the center alongside perhaps Zeus and Athena up front. There appear to be some flying Green Goblin-esque gliders at play, too, with new point-of-interest locations themed after these Greek gods and goddesses in the background.\nOnly time will tell, but fortunately, we don't have to wait too long because Fortnite Chapter 5: Season 2 – Myths & Mortals begins tomorrow, March 8. \nIn the meantime, check out the latest two Lego Islands to hit Fortnite, and then read about how Lady Gaga joined the fun last month.

This new Warbond is packed with \"high-voltage vibes,\" giving players access to new loadout potential with ultra-futuristic armor, guns that spit lightning, stylish capes, emotes, and more. \nWarbond – Cutting Edge goes live next week on March 14 and brings with it a new \"Acquisitions\" battle pass of things to unlock. However, don't fret if you're still working through the first free and premium Warbonds in Helldivers 2 – Warbonds don't expire. \nCheck out the Helldivers 2 Warbond – Cutting Edge trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nWithin this new Warbond, players will find multiple EX Series armor prototypes. The EX-03 Prototype 3 includes a rubber underlayer for insulation with \"wires that operate at a shocking 400,000 volts.\" The EX-16 Prototype 16 has an electric arc that generates a strong magnetic field. The EX-00 Prototype X is the \"end result of several billion Super Credits and 12 years of research into creating 'the Soldier of Tomorrow.'\"\nIn terms of new weapons, expect electricity. The LAS-16 is a laser rifle that fires in short bursts, and it doesn't need reloading either (just watch for overheating). The SG-8P Punisher Plasma is a modified Punisher shotgun that uses plasma rounds, and the ARC-12 Blitzer projects an arc of close-range lightning. Or, you can charge it up to fire powerful bolts good for taking out multiple targets. \nYou can also unlock the new G-23 Stun grenade and the LAS-7 Dagger pistol, too. \n\nElsewhere in this Warbond, Helldivers will find matching player cards for each cape and three new emotes. \nCutting Edge rolls out to Destroyer Acquisition panels on March 14. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Helldivers 2 review, and then read about the latest patch that added meteor showers and fire tornadoes to the war. \nAre you excited for Warbond – Cutting Edge in Helldivers 2?

          "description": "Amazon Studios has released the first official trailer for its upcoming Fallout TV series and unsurprisingly, it features power armor, a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles, Vault Dwellers, and plenty more. And it looks great. Today's trailer is just a three-minute tease of what awaits in the full series, which premiers next month on April 11 (originally set to premiere April 12, its premiere has been moved up one day), exclusively on Amazon Prime Video. \nThe trailer begins with a character explaining the importance of vaults before the world falls to nuclear destruction. Fast forward 200 years and Vault Dwellers emerge, ready to discover what awaits in the vast Californian wasteland. We get new looks at Ella Purnell's Jean, the primary Vault Dweller protagonist, Walton Goggins' Ghoul, Kyle MacLachlan's mysterious character, Aaron Clifton Moten's Maximus, who is a member of the Brotherhood of Steel, and more. \nCheck it out for yourself below in the Fallout TV series live-action trailer: \n\n\n\"Based on one of the greatest video game series of all time, Fallout is the story of haves and have-nots in a world in which there's almost nothing left to have,\" a press release reads. \"200 years after the apocalypse, the gentle denizens of luxury fallout shelters are forced to return to the irradiated hellscape their ancestors left behind – and are shocked to discover an incredibly complex, gleefully weird, and highly violent universe waiting for them.\" \nAmazon Studios, which is behind series like The Boys and Invincible, is producing Fallout alongside Kilter Films and executive producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy. Nolan directed the first three episodes of Fallout. \nFallout premieres on Amazon Prime Video on April 11. \nFor more, check out the teaser trailer for Fallout released back in December. After that, read Game Informer's reviews of Fallout 4 and Fallout 76. \nWhat do you think of this trailer? Let us know in the comments below!",

Intel XeSS upscaling is also supported and if your hardware has headroom to spare, you can use NVIDIA DLAA or FSR 3 Native AA to further boost image quality.” \nGhost of Tsushima on PC also features ultra-wide monitor support, including 21:9 and 32:9 resolutions, as well as 48:9 resolutions for triple monitor setups. \nGhost of Tsushima first launched for PlayStation 4 in 2020.

Arrowhead says that includes fire tornadoes, meteor showers, \"and many more.\" The other big change affects Eradicate missions, which task helldivers with killing a specified amount of bug enemies in a small area.

I visited Capcom last month to play the game for about three hours, and you can read Game Informer's Dragon's Dogma 2 preview impressions here, but I also spoke to director Hideaki Itsuno about how the game will run on consoles. \nSitting in Capcom's San Francisco, California, office, just 30 minutes to go until my interview with Itsuno, I saw that he tweeted about Dragon's Dogma 2's framerate.

          "description": "In August 2023, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem arrived in theaters, and, much to the delight of both longtime and newer fans, it was a terrific and fun watch. Just over a month after its theatrical debut, Paramount and Nickelodeon announced that publisher Outright Games and developer A Heartful of Games would be releasing a follow-up video game set in the Mutant Mayhem universe. While it hasn't had a name to this point, Game Informer can now exclusively confirm that the title is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed.\nWarning: This article contains spoilers for the 2023 film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.\n\nThe 3D brawler/platformer picks up after the events of Mutant Mayhem; the Turtles have been accepted by society following their heroics against Superfly and his band of mutants. Unfortunately, their dream of attending high school as average, everyday students is suddenly interrupted by a new wave of mutants invading New York City. Featuring an all-original storyline, Mutants Unleashed aims to have the same brand of humor as the 2023 film.\nPlayers take control of the four hero turtles, each with a unique playstyle, as they fight their way through the sewers and streets of New York. Outright Games touts how immersive both the world above and below ground is, as well as the cast of familiar faces for the brothers to meet and fight. As co-op is a massive piece of the history of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles video games, players can enjoy two-player local co-op in Mutants Unleashed. \nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed is set to arrive near the end of this year for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. For more info on the other big TMNT video game in development, The Last Ronin, head here for our exclusive interview with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles co-creator Kevin Eastman.",

You can check out a trailer for it here, but ahead of its debut, Microsoft and Bethesda have revealed a new Xbox Series X/S controller inspired by the popular post-apocalyptic game series, and you can pick it up right now. \nThat's because it's actually a new Fallout-themed design in Xbox Design Labs, which is where you can customize Xbox Series X/S controllers with pattern designs, unique colors, grips, and more.\n\n\nAs you can see in the image at the top of this story, the controller features the marquee Vault Boy holding his own controller on top of a black and white pattern of the various iterations of Vault Boy that have appeared throughout the series. The Xbox controller logo sits within the Fallout logo, and the d-pad retains the yellow-ish/gold color associated with Fallout as well. However, you can customize things like the d-pad, triggers, and more to have different colors if you'd like. \nIt's a great-looking controller, but it does come with a higher price tag compared to a standard Xbox Series X/S controller: $92.96. You can purchase it starting today. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Fallout 4 review, and then check out this new look at Amazon's Fallout TV series.

You could be forgiven for not being familiar with the character. Though he has made appearances in North America, he's never reached the popularity of his comic contemporaries like The Peanuts Gang or Mickey Mouse. I only became aware of the character after visiting developer Remedy in Finland in 2015 for our Quantum Break cover story. Members of Remedy's team educated me on the character and I brought back Moomin merchandise as souvenirs for my family.\nI had not thought much about the character since then, but recently, Moomin and his friends have been slowly invading my life prompting me to wonder if Moomin is on the verge of a United States popularity breakthrough. Developer Hyper Games and publisher Raw Fury must have thought the same thing, because it is releasing a Moomin video game on March 7.\nCheck out the video below to learn more about Moomin and see the cozy game in action.\n\n\nHead over to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

The sequel to developer Spiders’ 2019 RPG Greedfall was first announced in 2022.\nPremiering during last week’s Nacon Connect event, the trailer shows off the game’s customizable protagonist, a captured native of the previous game's setting of Teer Fradee, three years before the events of the first Greedfall. Forcibly relocated to the colonists’ continent of Gacane, you must escape by any means necessary. Like the first game, that includes using force, diplomacy, or cunning to forge your own choice-driven journey on this unfamiliar continent. The game features several factions to join and/or battle with, along with companions, romance options, and a revamped combat system with players controlling four characters at once. \n\n\nSpiders says Greedfall 2 is far more ambitious in scope, so it has decided to launch the game in early access via Steam to gather valuable feedback from players. Spiders also shares this initial version of the game will feature the entire beginning of the game, and players can explore roughly a quarter of the game’s full content. The game will receive regular updates, but saves will not be compatible between these different updates. You can learn more about what Greefall 2 entails by watching the developer deep dive video below: \n\n\nOnce its early access period concludes, Greefall 2: The Dying World is slated to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

          "description": "Digital Sun, the studio behind Moonlighter and The Mageseeker: A League of Legends Story, has announced its city-building RTS, Cataclismo, is coming in July.\nCataclismo was first revealed last year and was successfully crowdfunded via Kickstarter. It blends real-time strategy with tower defense. Set in a world devastated by an event known as the Cataclismo, you must rebuild. During the day, this means you’ll gather resources to construct fortresses brick-by-brick in a Lego-like fashion, along with placing soldiers and traps. Once night arrives, waves of monsters assault your stronghold, and you must repel them.\n\n\nThe game boasts realistic physics simulations (e.g., your strongholds collapse in a realistic manner, including falling debris that can squash enemies), and you can upgrade your fortress with improved building elements, troops, and more. In addition to a 30-hour story-driven single-player campaign, Cataclismo features a creative mode, a wave-based survival mode, and a battle-focused skirmish mode. \nCataclismo launches on July 18 for PC, and has a free Steam demo available now.",

You play a chosen warrior to fight against this blight. Combing elements of Diablo, Dark Souls, and even Animal Crossing, you’ll fight for survival while restoring the town of Sacrament. No Rest for the Wicked also happens to be Game Informer’s latest cover story.\nAlthough No Rest for the Wicked will be on Steam via Early Access for the foreseeable future, the game will come to consoles when it eventually launches into 1.0.

However, the game will still be available to play. \nPlayers who boot up the game have been greeted with a message, posted below, announcing that on March 4, Crash Team Rumble will get its last content drop. The game is not shutting down, though. The base experience will remain live and players will have access to a free 500-tier battle pass. This includes 104 new items from all content across Seasons 1 through 3 and all available event rewards. Developer Toys for Bob has also disabled Crash Coin purchases, and players can use any remaining coins to buy battle pass tier skips.\nCrash Team Rumble launched last year on June 20, meaning the game's support only lasted for roughly seven months. While it's nice that the game won't be disappearing for the time being (especially since it's quite fun), it's a bummer to see its support dry up so quickly. \nWe quite enjoyed Crash Team Rumble, scoring it an 8 out of 10 in our review. Writer Aron Garst writes, \"Crash Team Rumble's take on multiplayer platforming madness is unique, with enough depth to keep you on your toes after hours of gameplay. Those searching for a fresh take on the long-running series should give it a try.\" \n\n\nIn related news, Toys for Bob announced that it's splitting from Activision Blizzard to go independent and potentially partner with Microsoft.

We won't spoil when it happens in the game, and we won't discuss it in detail here, but we do want to let you know that we spent dozens of hours maxing out our relationships with each party member.

Embracer is selling the developer to a group of private investors in a deal worth $500 million, a source told the publication. \nOnce the deal goes through, Saber Interactive will be a privately owned company and free from Embracer, which is behind layoffs spread throughout the past couple of years. Following the transaction, the studio will continue work on its Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake, which it took over as the developer after Aspyr Media was removed from it in 2022. \n\n\nBloomberg reports this sale is another effort of Embracer to cut costs alongside studio closures and layoffs after a planned $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group fell through in 2023. The publication writes one of its sources says the $500 million deal comes with the option for Saber Interactive to bring with it multiple Embracer subsidiaries as well. \nSaber Interactive is also working on the recently announced first-person Jurassic Park: Survival. \n[Source: Bloomberg]",

He didn’t want to release this to the public yet, and wasn’t entirely sure what he was going to do with it.

Gone are the days of long strings of buoys and convoluted ship orders. Using ships is now as hassle-free as the other modes of transport. Just add the destination and send the ship on its way! In this post, I’m going to explain how the new pathfinder works and some of the challenges we had to overcome.",

Powered by Firebase, it's the fastest and easiest way to test your app against real devices, including the Google Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, select Samsung devices, and more.\n\nAfter connecting to a device, you can deploy your app, view the display, interact with the device (including rotating or unfolding the device), and anything else you might do with a device over a direct ADB over SSL connection—all without leaving Android Studio. When you're done using the device, Google wipes all your data and factory resets the device before making it available to another developer.\nDuring Open Alpha, you can use Device Streaming at no cost. To get started simply sign into your Developer account from Android Studio and select a Firebase project. If you don't already have a Firebase project, it's easy to create one.
