You may have even heard the names of some tools used to create AI art, like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and DALL-E. But you may also be wondering why these tools have spawned such strong opinions in the news, on social media, and even among people you know. After all, haven't we been having the \"robots will take our jobs\" discussion for decades, now?\nThe hook behind these publically-available AI tools is that they can take wildly specific prompts and unflinchingly depict them, like an artist working on commission that doesn't care if you want a lifesize painting of Mario and Luigi eating a barbecued Toad, just as long as they get paid. Except, of course, many of these tools do it for free. Many people are using tools like DALL-E to generate memeable images on social media, but others saw the commercial potential behind AI tools, and it wasn't long before an artist entered a piece of AI-generated art (using Midjourney) into a competition — and won, causing outrage and concern for the art industry.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Not only did we have an absolute banger in our hands — completely outdoing the first Mario Land in every respect and feeling like a 'proper' Super Mario Bros. game magically squeezed into the old Boy — but it was also the first time we got to bask in the glory of Wario. In his debut appearance, Mario’s rival was a sneaky yet imposing figure, towering over him.\nFast forward three decades (yes, really) and the Wario we know now is a fair bit different than that hulking menace we first saw in 1992. Wario now resides mostly in the comedy jobber region, occasionally being trotted out as a side-antagonist in Mario Sports games.

As the main menu flashed into existence before me, a new icon caught my eye. It was bold in its simplicity; a name encompassed the otherwise black image, with a silhouetted man standing within the capital letter ‘A’, flashlight in hand. The name was instantly recognisable, yet I hadn’t seen it in what felt like years. It was Alan Wake.\nMy mind was instantly thrown back to the year 2010 when I was a scrappy 21-year-old holding down a part-time retail job while just starting what would ultimately be a fruitless three-year course at university. I remembered that Alan Wake had been released on the Xbox 360 to critical acclaim, and the game itself had a strong impact on my life. It starred a seemingly ordinary man — the titular protagonist and writer — who embarked on a desperate search for his missing wife, Alice, in the small mountain town of Bright Falls. He soon discovered that the town held dark secrets and a penchant for the supernatural.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "This week, the Uncharted: Legacy Of Thieves Collection came to PC, marking the first time Nathan Drake's Tombraider-but-a-bro adventures have arrived on our fair platform. It is also, err, a collection of the last games in the series. The bundle comprises Uncharted 4: A Thief's End and The Lost Legacy, a standalone Uncharted adventure featuring ladythieves Chloe Frazer and Nadine Ross (they are thieves who are ladies, they don't steal women). Uncharteds 1-3, on the other hand, are nowhere to be seen. In fact, the only way to play them on PC right this second is to buy an expensive PlayStation Plus Premium subscription and stream them via the cloud as part of the Nathan Drake Collection - a far from ideal solution.\nThis puts us PC lot in a bit of a pickle. Naturally, if you haven't played any of these PlayStation exclusives until now, you're missing three entire games worth of story context. So, is it worth starting with Uncharted 4? The short answer is, \"Yes\". The long answer is, \"Yeeeeeeeeeees - probably\".\nRead more",

Despite a relatively good looking rendition of the iconic gothic metropolis and a pretty engaging story, Gotham Knights ultimately failed to capture my imagination. \r\n\n\r\nIt didn't help that throughout my time with Gotham Knights, I was thinking about the Arkham series. Rocksteady's trio of Batman-em-ups are essential superhero games, titles that redefined the genre and provided a template that still feels contemporary to this day. Aslyum, City and Knight fully immerse you in the Batman fantasy, successfully crafting a depiction of the caped crusader that was deadly, capable and - perhaps best of all - human.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "There's a particular battle in the first chapter of Tactics Ogre: Reborn that I've been banging my head against all week. It's an uphill fort siege where you're facing off against an evil necromancer who's shooting down powerful, magical fireballs at you from above, alongside his never-ending army of undead skelly archers. The challenging terrain alone would be a test of anyone's mettle in this tough, turn-based strategy game, especially when trying to parse all the different heights of its grid-based map. But having every enemy unit resurrect themselves after three turns unless you exorcise them with a single-use item or the lone Priest you've just recruited (who you may or may not have neglected to bring into battle with you) on top of all that? That smacks of the kind of late-game tomfoolery that more modern games of this ilk would normally save until their final acts. \nTactics Ogre: Reborn, on the other hand, likes to make its players sweat early. It was, after all, forged in the fires of the mid-90s SNES era, and looking back at old GameFAQ guides from 2010 (when it was remade for the PSP), it's clear this fight was just as much of a roadblock back in the day as it is now. Think of it as what yer lad Genichiro was to Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice - a hard, and often gruelling endurance test of everything you'd learned so far, but one that would ultimately set you up for the rest of the game upon claiming victory. I'm still not quite there yet, but having spent six hours noodling around the rest of Reborn's opening chapter, this granddaddy of Japanese strategy RPGs sure does hold up in the cold light of 2022.\nRead more",

Immediately after arriving, I embarked on an early-evening pilgrimage of sorts, my only goal to wander once familiar paths in an attempt to capture a spark of the life I no longer lived. As I ambled past houses that used to be homes, local haunts and darkened lecture halls, it was the differences that stood out the most. Pubs with names I didn’t recognise. Shops in locations that were more convenient than the ones I used to rely upon. Huge buildings that had seemingly sprung out of deserted scrubland. The city felt intimate yet alien. I was both a stranger and a local, a foreigner in a place I’d once adored.\r\n\n\r\nI was thinking about this experience a lot when I was invited to play a short hands-on demo of Capcom’s upcoming Resident Evil 4 remake. Here is a remake of my favourite game ever made, a title I have replayed countless times in the 17 years since its original debut, and all I can do is think about the little things. Tiny alterations that feel much larger when surrounded by something so immediately recognisable. This was the same Resident Evil 4 I’ve always known, but one that feels bigger, better and more dynamic. I left my session excited to play more, cautiously optimistic that Capcom may be in the process of crafting their best remake to date.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Those with a GeForce RTX graphics card could get some performance help, though, as the requirements’ notes say that meeting the recommended spec will allow for 4K resolution “using DLSS or similar technology”. That’s not quite a formal confirmation of Nvidia DLSS support, but strongly indicates it, maybe along with similar upscaling systems like AMD FSR or Intel XeSS.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Sorry to have to start another Letter From The Editor with an apology about how terribly late it is, but honestly, I'm not entirely sure where the time has gone. One minute it was June, and then suddenly... almost November!? I'm sorry everyone, truly. It has, in part, been another period of almost being able to announce some things, but also not quite. We're still working to get our proposed RPS Game Club off the ground, for example, but finding a good quality source of regular game keys for it has proven to be an elusive endeavour, to say the least. I'd imagine this will probably be a project for 2023 now (a delay, how quaint!), given how close we are to the end of the year, but I'll keep you posted as soon as we've got more to share on it.\nThings that are happening though, is the return of The RPS 100, which you may have seen us post about earlier in the week. This is our annual countdown of our favourite PC games of all time, as voted for by the RPS Treehouse. This year's list is quite different to the one we did last year - we do, after all, have pretty much a brand-new team in place now - and I'm looking forward to sharing that with you all next week. We even got our art team to make a special fancy header image for it this year and everything! Plus, if you were one of the people put out by our (accidental) glossing over of a certain immersive sim last year, you really won't want to miss it.\nRead more",

They were also fighting for their lives against thousands of bloodthirsty rats eager to devour them. These two have lived through more danger and trauma than anyone should have in a thousand lifetimes, and after the first game’s sort-of happy-ish ending, it got me thinking: when will these kids ever catch a break?\nTurns out the answer is never. Asobo’s follow-up A Plague Tale: Requiem is just as gory and bleak as its predecessor and as the siblings continue to battle through a violent world that wants them dead, they'll both face difficult moral decisions in the name of survival. Oh, and there are more rats. Like, a lot more rats.\nRead more",

          "description": "Is it just me, or did Persona 5 never feel quite at home on the PlayStation 4? Sure, it looked gorgeous on a big TV, its bright colours popping all over your living room, but it always felt bit wrong to me. I think it's all about pacing. Persona 5's blend of turn-based combat and life sim elements hardly moves at a breakneck speed. There's a lot of reading. A lot of listening to your pals chat about their hopes and fears. A lot of pressing one button to progress a line of dialogue onto the next. Shoving that on your 65\" 4K TV always seemed a bit overkill.\r\n\n\r\nBasically, I never got into Persona 5 when it first launched on PS4. I played about three hours of it and then binned it off in favour of something else. In 2020, during a moment of first-lockdown madness, I bought Persona 5 Royal for full price, thinking maybe my issue with the original release was that there wasn't enough of it, but surprisingly discovered it still wasn't for me. At this point, I'd invested £100 into my \"Do I like Persona 5?\" experiment and was quickly realising the result was a pretty firm \"No, mate, you don't\". So when I sat down with the PC version of the game on the Steam Deck to test it out, I figured I'd play it for a few hours and then never touch it again. I was wrong. I was so very wrong.\n\n \nRead more",

Since its updated and expanded Royal version dropped on PlayStation some years later, I've been afraid to make my return. You'd think I'd be itching to delve back into what's essentially the definitive version of the Phantom Thieves' adventure, and yet it's precisely because it blew me away the first time that I've been reluctant to go back.\nNow? Now I feel silly. After playing the early portions of Persona 5: Royal, which finds itself coming to practically every remaining platform this week, including PC, my goodness me, it's wonderful to be back in Shibuya with the gang. Already it's the Persona 5 I adored, with new cutscenes and pacing adjustments to make it – somehow – even better. Have you never played Persona before? Good! Let me twist your arm.

Unfortunately, while on a deep sea dive to retrieve the tapes of episodes 13 and 14 (an expedition funded by supporters; your generosity is always appreciated), my ship was attacked by a large and unusually toothsome whale-like creature. The cursed thing took a huge bite out of the side of our noble vessel, The Squiggled Egg, and we were forced to abandon ship. It was only by the grace of the botswain Hughbert Threads that I'm alive to write this post today, as the man gave his life beating back the foul beast, giving a large part of the rest of the crew time to get away. Alas, in the confusion, I only secured episode 14, and episode 13 is now lost to time. That is definitely what happened, and not that the digital recording got mangled somehow.\nStill, episode 14 (which is now episode 13, even though I say 14 in the recording) is now here for you to enjoy. It's all about bad and obsolete palaeontology - the weird ways people in history interpreted fossils, and why.\nRead more",

          "description": "Minecraft players have been able to vote on a new mob  once a year ever since 2017, and this year’s polling begins today. Things are working a little differently for 2022’s mob vote, though. Instead of casting your vote on Twitter, you’ll be able to head into a dedicated carnival-themed Bedrock server, do it in the Minecraft launcher, or on Minecraft.net. Devs Mojang will reveal which mob scored the most votes during the Minecraft Live livestream tomorrow.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Scorn is a deliberately grim game with a lot of body horror. Best avoid it and this review if you have issues with body horror themes.\nI was talking to a friend about Scorn and they asked, \"Is there a story?\". And yeah, Scorn has a story. At some point there'll be a two hour YouTube video outlining how it has a clear and nuanced plot, or that it's a metaphor for periods and erections, or both. In the immediate, it's about slithering out of a pod, staggering through the desert, and finding yourself in a strange, huge rotting machine made of rock and flesh that's already decades into abandonment and decay, and where most things look a bit penisy or womby. It's about the lizardy parasite latched to your back gradually transforming your body. It's about grim squishy noises and survival.\nScorn doesn't have dialogue, or a map. It doesn't really have a HUD, it doesn't have quest markers, and your character will not, upon seeing a strange new device, say something like \"Hmm... seems like a key. Maybe if I find the two missing ones, it'll open up a way forward!\" out loud. It won't even pull focus to the corridor you should check next. You just have to look around, experiment, and figure it out. I think I like it. I don't know if I can recommend it.\nRead more",

          "description": "The Ryzen 7 5800X was a great gaming CPU when it launched in 2020, and it remains one of the fastest options going despite the recent release of Ryzen 7000 processors late last month. The 5800X also has two major advantages: it works on a wide range of cheap motherboards with DDR4 RAM, and it's way cheaper than the 7700X - especially when it's discounted on Ebay US, as is the case today!\nSo: let's cut to the chase. The 5800X is down to $229.99 at Ebay, from a list price of $449, meaning it's nearly 50% off. That also makes it $170 cheaper than the equivalent Ryzen 7000 processor, the $400 eight-core Ryzen 7700X. Or, to put it another way, you're paying around 60% of the price for at least 80% of the gaming performance of that newer CPU - not bad, given that you'll also pay way less for a complete Ryzen 5000 system (with AM4 motherboards and DDR4) than a complete Ryzen 7000 one (with AM5 motherboards and DDR5). \nRead more",

          "description": "The strategy RPG is making its way to Nintendo's portable console\nTactics fans keep getting more games, and that now includes a surprising port from Aksys Games. Record of Agarest War is making its way to Nintendo Switch in March 2023.\nThis strategy RPG originally released in 2007 in Japan, eventually making a western debut on the PlayStation 3 in 2009. It's since been ported to many other platforms and now, years and years later, it pops up again on Nintendo Switch.\nYou can check out the trailer here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjCvtrHq0kM\nNo details have been listed yet about whether this will have any new enhancements or features.\nGenerations of war\nIf you're unfamiliar with Record of Agarest War, it's a strategy RPG with a dating twist. Developed as a collaboration between Compile Heart, Red Entertainment, and Idea Factory, you play as several different protagonists embroiled in conflict.\nBut the way you navigate through the plot is, well, through generations. As the first protagonist, you can romance and marry one of several party members. Then, your child goes on to be protagonist number 2. This plays out across several generations, with the chosen bride affecting the next hero's stats and aspects of their appearance.\nSo yes, fans of Fire Emblem: Awakening's child-unit min-maxing might want to take note. This is a bit of a surprise, as Agarest War has been a more niche series in the pantheon of SRPG discussion. But the genre has been surging, with both new titles and remasters of old classics. It looks like Aksys wasn't going to let Agarest War sit on the sidelines for this tactical resurgence.\nThe news arrived as part of an Aksys announcement stream, alongside several other game announcements. Cuddly Forest Friends is set to arrive on Switch in 2023, Spooky Spirit Shooting Gallery heads to Switch in summer 2023, and Tengoku Struggle -Strayside- is set for Switch in 2024.\nThe post Record of Agarest War is coming to Switch next year appeared first on Destructoid.",

This update will be smaller than some of our larger updates that bring new content into the game. With this update, we’re bringing new items into the Atomic Shop to release over the coming weeks, addressing a number of bugs, and kicking off a brand-new Challenge event for the 25th Anniversary. We are currently looking to begin maintenance for Fallout 76 at 10:00 a.m. ET on October 25. We will be sure to share update with you in the Bethesda Studios Discord and the Fallout Twitter so that you know precisely when you can log back in. Starting October 25, you can hunt down costumed Scorched throughout Appalachia to loot Mystery Candy, Spooky Treat Bags, and of course, legendary items. Track down Scorched at their usual haunts, keep an ear out for their spine-tingling sounds, and you’re bound to find at least a few who are dressed up for Halloween.\"\n\nIt's been a busy month for Fallout 76 amid the 25th anniversary celebration, and the game just hosted the Invaders from Beyond seasonal event, which ended on October 18. Currently the team is going from event to event: and even if some of them are on repeat at this point, there is some movement beyond the mega-patches.\nWe'll have to wait until the day-of most likely to see what this \"smaller\" patch actually entails, but suffice to say like most of the micro-updates, they'll involve tons of bug fixes: some of which address issues that have been lingering for a while, or crept up in the patch before it.\nThe post Fallout 76’s Halloween event kicks off October 25 with a “smaller” update appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Fans of the Resident Evil 4 dog known as Hewie wil never forgive you, Capcom\nResident Evil 4 is known as one of the most iconic games of all time. It's got stylized gameplay, it's got quippy one-liners, and it's got a sexy protagonist in the form of Leon Kennedy. Fans of Resident Evil 4 love every frame of that game, so naturally, they've been closely analyzing any footage of the highly anticipated remake until its release in March of next year. One of the most famous details that players encounter early on in the game's story is a dog stuck in a bear trap in the woods. Players have the option of either leaving the dog, killing it, or setting it free -- naturally you can imagine which option became the most popular.\nIGN reviewed some shocking new footage of the Resident Evil 4 remake, however, and staunch dog-releasers are not going to be too thrilled about what they see. The video shows the player walking the familiar route through the woods, only to find that the dog has already been killed, in a really gruesome way, I might add. It's pretty upsetting stuff to see by any standard, but knowing that dog has so many fans (who have affectionately named him Hewie) makes it all that much harder to stomach.\nhttps://twitter.com/CanYouPetTheDog/status/1583248767217995776\nWhile this certainly looks like it's in the Resident Evil 4 remake in some capacity, I'm of the belief that you're still able to save the dog after all, and this video is a ploy to get more buzz about the game. Maybe I'm just in denial, but I have a hard time believing that Capcom would intentionally leave out one of the most beloved details of their entire game. If it is the case that we won't see Hewie alive again, at least it makes the experience of having saved him in the original game all the more special.\nThe post Fans are devastated by the dog’s death in the Resident Evil 4 remake appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A who's who of survival horror\nAs part of yesterday evening's Resident Evil Showcase, Capcom announced that it would be holding a short early access test session for its delayed multiplayer title Resident Evil Re: Verse. The beta will take place between Sunday, October 23, and Tuesday, October 25 on PS4, PC, and Xbox One platforms.\nThe purpose of this short beta is to test the crossplay capabilities of the multiplayer shooter ahead of its release on October 28 — cutting it a bit close, perhaps, but nevertheless. Anyone with a copy of Resident Evil Village can participate in the beta, all you need do is download the client from the store of your choosing and you'll be ready to rock once the switches are flicked on the servers. Boom schlack-lack.\n\nOriginally intended to launch as the multiplayer component of Resident Evil Village, Re:Verse has been repeatedly delayed as the developer worked to stabilize the build and its contents. The multiplayer game — essentially an evolution of the popular \"Mercenaries\" mode — will see a legacy of familiar stars from the Resident Evil franchise fighting it out in a series of modes set against the backdrop of some familiar locales.\nIn addition to the last-minute beta, Capcom also offered up initial details for Re:Verse's post-launch content. Launching with six \"Survivors\", five \"Creatures\", two stages, a challenge mission, and a 30-level battle pass, Resident Evil Re:Verse will receive several initial updates, each adding more characters, stages, costumes, missions, and modes. There are currently three updates planned post-launch, but dates and details were not forthcoming.\nResident Evil Re:Verse launches October 28 on PS4, PC, and Xbox One.\nThe post Resident Evil Re:Verse early access beta kicks off this weekend appeared first on Destructoid.",

It features the likeness of Spark from Sparks of Hope, and it'll run you 400 Platinum Points. While I'm generally not big on the Rabbids themselves, this version of Spark is really cute.\nThe Spark keychain follows suit with an effort to release at least one item on My Nintendo that ties into a first party game (or in this case, a game that deals with first party properties).  Recent tie-ins include a Splatoon 3 bag and sticker set, a Mario Strikers bag, and a Switch Sports cooling towel. All of the above are still available at the moment at the time of publication.\nAs a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time.

These cloud editions will see the games streamed directly to the Switch platform, allowing Nintendo's plucky hybrid console to depict the top-tier visuals and intense action of each respective horror show.\nhttps://youtu.be/vJ1Ih37TnTI\nThe action kicks off with Resident Evil Village on October 28. Resident Evil 2 will then launch November 11, with Resident Evil 3 following a week later on November 18, and finally rounded out with Resident Evil VII: Biohazard on December 16. That's hours upon hours of top-tier goo-filled action to keep you warm during those cold winter nights. All three titles are well worth your time and effort, and these new cloud editions will open up their creepy worlds to a new audience of players... You should play it in bed, under the covers. Oooooo... Spooky.\nResident Evil Village, Resident Evil 2, Resident Evil 3, and Resident Evil VII: Biohazard are all available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

After a riotous response, Sony deleted it.\nhttps://twitter.com/evanf1997_/status/1583143932237844481\nHere's what the tweet said:\n\"Can you see it: which PlayStation game cover are we zooming in on?\"\n\nYep, it was Bloodborne. It was even trending!\nBut as Twitter gaming pundit Nibellion points out, you probably shouldn't be doing something like this unless you have news to back it up. Sure, having a bit of fun with some games and such can work (Nintendo does it on their YouTube channel), but Twitter? That's just opening yourself up to a sea of roasting.\nFans have been asking for an FPS upgrade patch for PS5 for years, and/or some form of a remaster. The action game, which demands a lot of its players on a technical level, is still locked to 30 FPS, much to the chagrin of most of its playerbase. Some would argue that it's the only glaring flaw left for the project, which has to be rectified at some point. Bloodborne is the kind of game many will be playing for decades, and From Software is no stranger to returning to their old catalog.\nFor now, it's the status quo.

The two titles will be available to subscribers from November 2.\nDeveloped by Hudson Soft and released in 1999 and 2000 respectively, Mario Party and Mario Party 2 were Nintendo's hugely successful efforts to transpose the beloved Super Mario Bros. universe to a \"tabletop\" format, with players chasing each other around a digital board game, and battling it out in fun, short, silly, and simplistic mini-games.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meP0WTgUJcE\nFocusing on basic controls, easy-to-learn rules, and fast action, Mario Party can be seen as one of Nintendo's earliest forays into the \"anyone can play\" demography. This inclusive view of the family gaming audience would lead to the development and staggering success of the Nintendo Wii platform.\nSince those halcyon years, the franchise has continued on successive platforms including the Gamecube, Nintendo Wii, and, most recently, the Nintendo Switch in the form of 2021's Mario Party Superstars. While the visuals and creativity have obviously progressed with each and every entry, the series has never lost sight of its inclusive nature, still offering pick-up-and-play fun for both dedicated video game fans, and visiting holiday relatives. With these Nintendo Switch Online re-releases, series fans who missed out on the franchise's formative days can jump back into the action all over again.\nBagsy Peach.\nMario Party and Mario Party 2 join the Nintendo Switch Online archives on November 2.\nThe post Mario Party and Mario Party 2 join Nintendo Switch Online next month appeared first on Destructoid.",

Odd, that. Famously resource-hungry upon their initial PC release, the titles are well known for their dynamic action, dazzling visuals, and groundbreaking special effects. Of course, this trinity of remasters only serves to add further polish to all three games, with improved lighting and weather effects, high-resolution textures, and visual enhancements to the in-game models.\nIf you never got around to experiencing this exciting series of actioners, (perhaps your 486 DX 2 wasn't up to the task), then this release could prove the perfect opportunity to check them out. Steam will be launching the trilogy at a discounted price for the first week of release, with a pretty chunky 40% off of the asking price. In addition, players who already own the original Crysis Remastered on Steam will earn further discount, allowing them to round out the collection for not too many dollarydoos.\nCrysis Remastered Trilogy launches on Steam November 17.

In character action games, it was occasionally a new costume or some insane toggle that fundamentally transformed the game in some way.

          "description": "Take the writer's eerie tale on the go\nJust in time for the scary season, Alan Wake gets a new portable form. Alan Wake Remastered is out today, October 20, for the Nintendo Switch.\nThe listing is currently live on the eShop and going for $29.99, with a launch discount bringing it down to $23.99 right now.\nNintendo Switch's version of the remaster contains all the content, including the base game and both The Signal and The Writer story expansions.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PORiCbyWAM4\nNotably, it runs on the Nintendo Switch too. Unlike some other modern games that have made their way to Nintendo's handheld recently, Alan Wake Remastered is not a cloud app, but seems to run right off the Switch hardware.\nThe writer will go portable\nIt's an impressive feat, and makes me a bit interested to see how the remaster holds up on Switch. Alan Wake Remastered was no visual slouch when it first released for other platforms.\nThat said, developers have been working some real technical magic with the Nintendo Switch lately. Just look at ports like NieR: Automata's Switch version. As the years have gone on, it's impressive what some have accomplished.\nWe'll see if Alan Wake Remastered also stands up as a port, but as a game, it's certainly held its following. Heck, it's well-liked enough to even be tied into Remedy's Control, and get a sequel greenlit for development.\nThis story of a writer fighting the dark with a flashlight seems to still hold sway. And if you're curious about it and want something eerie to dig into on the go, Alan Wake Remastered is now available for that on the Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Alan Wake Remastered is out on Nintendo Switch today appeared first on Destructoid.",

Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the embedded video below. \nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. \n\n\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, as I revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure.

          "description": "Warner Bros. Games has announced Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, a mobile-exclusive Mortal Kombat experience. The game is described as a collection role-playing game where players build a roster of fighters from the Mortal Kombat universe and “unleash them in massive real-time group battles.” It’s more than just battles, though – Onslaught is also said to feature a cinematic story experience where fighters have to defeat a “dark and dangerous threat.”\nThis is not the first time Mortal Kombat has appeared on a mobile device. Mortal Kombat Mobile was released in 2015 alongside Mortal Kombat X and eventually adapted characters and features from Mortal Kombat 11 as well. Mortal Kombat Mobile has been downloaded over 150 million times since its launch, so it’s no wonder WB Games wants to release more games from the franchise.\nOctober 8 marked the series’ 30th anniversary, and Mortal Kombat: Onslaught seems to be a celebration of that. Not only is it the newest mobile game in the series, but it’s also the most recent title since the release of Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate in 2020. As far as the future of the series is concerned outside of the mobile market, Netherrealm has been pretty quiet lately. Outside of our interview with franchise co-creator Ed Boon where he said we'd have to wait a little longer, the most recent news we’ve received has been this tweet:\nPatiently waiting for news on NRS’s next game…. pic.twitter.com/1ulQHZhnKx\nOctober 15, 2022\nMortal Kombat: Onslaught is coming out sometime in 2023.

It retains the core strategic gameplay of the original, so if you liked the first game, you’ll probably enjoy this as well. Removing the grid and having freedom of movement feels liberating, however, and is one of the big game-changers. It's interesting because this doesn't change my approach to playing a turn-based tactics game.

The most persistent is that Bloober Team, creators of The Medium and Layers of Fear, is remaking Silent Hill 2. Late September, it was reported that a title called Silent Hill: The Short Message had been rated in South Korea. \nThe last full-fledged Silent Hill game was 2012’s ill-recieved Book of Memories for PS Vita. Of course, there was also 2014's P.T., the formerly playable teaser for Hideo Kojima's canceled Silent Hills. \nFor years, Silent Hill fans have had to settle for rumor and innuendo in regards to what’s next for the series, so hopefully, Wednesday’s presentation rewards that patience with some exciting announcements.

          "description": "To celebrate Dead Space’s 14th anniversary, Motive Studio held a special livestream showcasing its upcoming remake of the game. The presentation featured an extended guided walkthrough showing off new gameplay footage as well as a rundown of features designed to make the game more terrifying than ever. \nThe video’s side-by-side comparisons illustrate the major differences between the original and the remake. One big change is that the Ishimura is now a seamless, interconnected ship that players can explore more freely. For example, using Isaac’s rocket thrusters to soar through areas you could only walk through before. A new system called the Intensity Spawn Director remixes necromorph spawn points, ensuring they’ll ambush veteran players in unexpected ways and, sometimes, in greater numbers. Dead Space also features improved necromorph dismemberment, new side quests designed to flesh out the supporting cast, new alternate fire modes for weapons, new puzzles, and more. \n\n\nDead Space launches on January 27 for PlayStation5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

Their name is Bellibolt, and they’re the signature partner of Iono, the newest gym leader from Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.\n\n\nIn Wednesday’s initial video, Iono introduced herself as not just a gym leader but also a streamer. She then asked her fictional followers to guess what her mystery partner Pokémon was based on a handful of details, including its type, the placement of its eyes, and the fact that it’s “so cute.” If you had trouble guessing, don't feel bad; today, we’ve learned that her partner is a new Pokémon altogether.\nNintendo and The Pokémon Company released a series of follow-up tweets, giving us new information about Bellibolt that sounds like it was pulled right from the Pokédex. One of the images reveals that they have a new ability called \"Electromorphosis,\" which allows Bellibolt to power up their next electric-type move after being hit by an attack.\nSay hello to the new EleFrog Pokémon, Bellibolt!\n#PokemonScarletViolet\nhttps://t.co/z7lNKThsDX pic.twitter.com/EUdcQcsUoA\nOctober 14, 2022\nYou'll be able to add Bellibolt to your team when Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet come to switch on November 18.

The narrative-driven sci-fi adventure will now launch in April to ensure it receives a final coat of polish.\nDeveloper Dramatic Labs announced the news on Twitter, stating it’s taking the extra time to ensure “a truly immersive Star Trek experience”. You can read the full statement below (click the image to enlarge).\nResurgence was first announced during The Game Awards 2021 and is a choice-driven adventure game that follows a similar design template to Telltale Games’ titles (Dramatic Labs consists of ex-Telltale employees). The story unfolds shortly after the events of Star Trek: The Next Generation as players control two original characters, an officer and a commander, to solve a mystery aboard the U.S.S. Resolute. The narrative and your relationships change depending on your choices, and gameplay features light combat and puzzle-solving. Resurgence is currently slated to launch on PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. \nWe played a demo of Star Trek: Resurgence during Summer Game Fest in June, and you can read our hands-on impressions here.

Improvements include ray-traced reflections/shadows, unlocked framerate, ultra-widescreen support, Nvidia DLSS 3/DLAA support, Nvidia Reflex, and DualSense controller support.

Former editor Andrew Reiner wrote in his review that: \n\"For a second act, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales satisfies. Taking to the web-line and soaring across a wintery New York skyline is every bit as enthralling as it was before, and Miles develops into a fantastic hero. This follow-up doesn’t have as much of a sinister punch, but it delivers some great plot twists and concludes with another eye-opening post-credits sequence that teases an exciting future for Insomniac’s Spider-Man series.\"",

          "description": "Final Fantasy VII The First Soldier, the mobile multiplayer battle royale, is being shut down in January. The news comes a month shy of the game's one-year anniversary, having launched for iOS and Android in November 2021. \nSquare Enix states that it feels it hasn’t delivered the experience it aimed for, so it will begin winding down service starting today. A roadmap on the game’s website lists a three-step sunsetting schedule. Today, you can no longer purchase Shinra credits from the shop, but you can still spend the credits you own until the game shuts down. On November 1, support for non-English localization ends (meaning text will only be displayed in English going forward). Finally, on January 11, The First Soldier goes offline for good.\nHere's the full End of Service announcement via Twitter:\nThe First Soldier was revealed in February 2021 alongside another mobile FFVII RPG, Ever Crisis (which has yet to release but has a closed beta planned for this year). The third-person battle royale took place before the events of FFVII and pit 75 players against each other as SOLDIER candidates. In addition to using firearms, players wield magic and even summons. Square previously stated The First Soldier was an attempt to attract a wider fanbase to the FFVII universe while giving existing fans a new way to enjoy its mythos. \nUnfortunately, this isn't the first Square Enix published multiplayer game to get the axe this year. Babylon's Fall, Platinum Games' live-service action RPG, is also being shutdown in February, less than a year after its ill-received launch. \nWhile The First Soldier is going away, plenty of FFVII content is in the pipeline. As previously mentioned, Ever Crisis remains on the docket, and Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion releases on December 13. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the follow-up to Remake, is scheduled to launch next winter.",

Check out the gym leader Iono trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, there's a lot going on in this new video. Iono is very much a Paldean influencer, which is a fun addition to the universe of Pokémon, but she's also a gym leader that we'll be facing off against in the game. As for her type, it's Electric, and while not confirmed, it seems the video is hinting toward a gym challenge for her. Before actually battling her, we might have to successfully complete her \"who's that Pokémon?\" test.\nIn this instance, she describes her very own Pokémon pal, but we don't get the answer. Perhaps we're meant to know what it is based on her description or maybe she's describing a Pokémon we haven't yet met. Only time will tell. Fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer to meet this \"Supercharged Streamer\" because Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet hit Switch on November 18. \nIn the meantime, check out this 14-minute Pokémon Scarlet and Violet gameplay trailer from last week, and then watch this video all about Wiglett, a new Diglett-like Pokémon.

          "description": "Witchfire has been one of the most promising-looking shooters since its reveal in 2017. The dark fantasy romp was slated to launch in early access later this year, but a shift in design has forced developer The Astronauts to push that launch into next year.\nThe Astronauts has decided to rework Witchfire’s arena-style combat into an open-world format. Creative director Adrian Chmielarz writes in a blog post that the change makes Witchfire a “better” game. \n“The feature is now 95% implemented. It makes the game better. It is kind of hard for me to imagine the player did not have that freedom before. Sure, you can still be trapped by the witch in this or that spot, and some doors will be closed until you find a key, and it might be too dangerous to enter areas closer to the boss before you are ready– but the world is wide open for you to explore in almost any order, and you can both push forward and retreat as you please.”\nChmielarz also teases more Witchfire news to emerge in the next week or so. It won’t be gameplay footage but rather content promoting the game’s art and world in some fashion. \nWitchfire blends gunplay with the supernatural as players wield guns and magic to fend off otherworldly threats. The game is set in an alternate reality where you’re tasked with hunting down a witch at the behest of the church. The Astronauts previously developed The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, and the studio is made up of ex-People Can Fly employees. \nWitchfire is still slated to launch on PC via The Epic Game Store in early 2023.

One of those franchises was Mortal Kombat, a bloody, gory fighting game that took concepts from other fighting games and dialed them to 11. The series became notorious for its spine-ripping, heart-grabbing, limb-chopping action, but beneath the controversies and the hearings was a technically sound, capable fighting game. \nThe Mortal Kombat franchise has continued to grow and evolve, showcasing massive staying power in a sometimes ruthless industry.

She doesn’t have the same handle on her abilities as Bayonetta (nor her confident elegance), so Viola sports a vastly different playstyle that reflects her inexperience. \n\n\nInstead of being adept at using a variety of weapons like Bayonetta, Viola only uses her katana and throwing darts. She also summons her demonic companion Cheshire for backup. What she lacks in finesse, though, she makes up for with raw power.\nPlaying as Viola, her style feels noticeably more deliberate. She’s still quick, but her sword attacks feel more measured and, most of all, impactful. This approach tells me t…",

The game introduces several big additions, quite literally in some cases, to the game’s already winning formula, and you can check them out in this exclusive gameplay video. \nBefore we jump on what’s new, the core of Bayonetta 3’s combat remains the same, so veterans will find it easy to slip back into the fun dance of chaining combos, peppering foes with gunfire, unleashing torture attacks, and split-second dodging to trigger the time-slowing Witch Time effect. However, one of Bayonetta’s new tricks is Demon Masquerade. Weapons are now imbued with the power of Bayonetta’s many Infernal Demons.

You’ll also get a grilled meat set, which not only lets you cook up tasty meat but also play mini-games to raise Sonic’s strength. It's a small bundle but a neat way to return the favor after Capcom introduced Sonic-themed content in Monster Hunter Rise last year.

The publisher also appears to be teasing the reveal of a new Crash game \nThe publisher sent a special Crash-themed pizza box (from \"Aku Aku's Steam-In Pizza Shack\") to influencers, such as YouTuber Candian Guy Eh. His unboxing video shows that the box is taped with a not-so-subtle message that Crash 4 heads to Steam on October 18. The game, which launched in 2020, is currently playable on PC only through Battle.net. \nAdditionally, the box was also taped with a message that read, “Hungry for more? Try our new Wumpa Pizza for $12.08!” Given that The Game Awards is set to air on December 8, it appears highly likely we’ll find out the nature of this title (rumored to be a party game called Wumpa League) during the annual show.\nAre you excited to play Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time on Steam?

Thankfully, Nintendo swooped in to fund and publish Bayonetta 2, locking it in as a third-party exclusive. Bayonetta 2 features improved combat, new features, an even nuttier plot, and a near-bottomless well of action.
