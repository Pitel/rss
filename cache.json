          "description": "Strictly Limited fun.\nWonder Boy has a convoluted gaming lineage. Initially a platform arcade game featuring a squat caveman-boy in a grass skirt, and developed by Westone (then Escape) for Sega, the sequels quickly splintered off into action role-playing territory. Oddly, there are two chronological entries for Wonder Boy III — Monster Lair (originally an arcade title), and The Dragon’s Trap (originally for the Master System). Compounding the perplexity, the fifth game in the Monster World series is known as Wonder Boy V: Monster World III in Japan, originally released for the Mega Drive. From there, Monster World VI, the sixth entry, was the 16-bit era’s swan song and wasn’t followed up until Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom landed on Nintendo Switch in 2018.\nConfused? Let’s continue. Hudson Soft licensed the Wonder Boy IP in 1986, but because Westone had already sold the rights to the name and character to Sega, they renamed their version “Adventure Island”, retaining the same gameplay structure as the original arcade game, while branching out into a new platform series for the NES, Game Boy, and Super Nintendo. Here, the protagonist was remodelled to resemble famous '80s Hudson Soft executive, Takahashi Meijin.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Combining rich HD 3D backdrops with SNES-inspired pixel art characters and monsters, HD-2D's colour palette, lighting, and beautifully detailed boss sprites have helped create a nostalgic, beloved art style that fans want to see more of.\nIn a recent interview with 4Gamer, Triangle Strategy producers Tomoya Asano and Yasuaki Arai sat down to discuss just how they implemented these retro-style visuals to their recent strategy game. One interesting question to jump out of the interview — translated by Jarop for Nintendo Everything — is when 4Gamer asks Asano why other studios haven't tried using HD-2D. More and more indie studios have embraced pixel art to capture the heart of the games that they've been inspired by, but Asano has quite a simple answer:\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "\"We want to archive and save as much of the video games industry as possible\".\nThe Embracer Group is a significant gaming company that is still somewhat under the radar in comparison to other major brands. Previously known as THQ Nordic and operating out of Sweden, it's become the parent organisation for a number of major gaming companies - familiar names that are part of the group include Saber Interactive, Gearbox and Aspyr. It made waves recently by acquiring Crystal Dynamics, Square Enix Montréal and Eidos-Montréal from Square Enix.\nIt's a significant player in the industry, then, but has recently earned attention for another project - Embracer Games Archive. It seems like an example of a company using its significant resources to pick up a baton normally held my volunteers and non-profit organisations, with a mission to acquire, preserve and share gaming history and culture.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Biomotor Unitron joins the likes of Big Bang Pro Wrestling, SNK Gals' Fighters, and Samurai Shodown! 2 (among many others) on the system in representing the classic handheld console. And it seems like Neo Geo fans could be in luck as there may well be many more classic titles on the way.\nOne of our readers — Durrdevil — got in touch after looking at Biomotor Unitron's files and discovering something pretty interesting hidden inside. Within the game, there's a file listing all the other Neo Geo Pocket Color games so far released, plus some others. Some have already been released elsewhere, like Dark Arms: Beast Buster 1999 (which is on the Neo Geo Pocket Selection Vol.1) and Crush Roller (which is part of the Steam release of Vol.1).

It's already much more polished than the demo, with more yet to come. It's a life sim with a bit of a Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing vibe, except instead of farming you are a witch called Ellie (size: small) living in a biome (type: forest).\nIn the story you start to free the nearby village from cursed vines, and this requires that you catalogue and collect ingredients for spells, and thence expand your repertoire of witchy recipes. At the same time you can trade spells and magical candy with locals for currency, which you can use to improve your little machines - a roaster, a caldron, a press for ingredients - to make even better things, more efficiently. It's a satisfying process of mastery and exploration. But that is not the important bit. The important bit is that Little Witch In The Woods is disgustingly adorable.\nRead more",

In a community post, AMD asserted this particular Preview Driver could provide double-digit percentage gains in games running DirectX 11; claims that were backed up by early independent testing, like the creator of benchmarking tool CapFrameX getting an extra 24% out of Crysis Remastered.\r\n\n\r\nThis week, AMD Software Adrenaline Edition 22.5.2 released, making that new Radeon driver available to anyone who didn’t fancy switching to preview builds. Armed with an RX 6500 XT (a low-end card that desperately needs a performance kick), I gave the new software a whirl – and found that, for all those big numbers, Radeon owners should probably lower their expectations.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Unless there’s a direct sequel, you must pull your pants up and shelve those emotions and move on.\nNot that I struggle with letting go of characters and stories particularly, but my brain makes an exception for the Yakuza games.

          "description": "Right now, a pair of massive 16TB external hard drives are going 'cheap' on Amazon UK. Despite RRPs of over £400, you can get a basic model for £245 or a slightly fancier box for £270. Either way, you'll have a ton of storage space for backups, video projects, game install directories and other media. \nMy colleagues at Digital Foundry pick these drives up regularly for their video production work, as capturing game footage and creating YouTube videos quickly causes standard hard drive sizes to fill up. You never want to be in a situation where you're forced to delete your old work to save the new stuff, so having a capacious backup like this is perfect. \nRead more",

Flanked by devs and squidged between other journos, I saw two short demos, one right at the start of his adventure, and the other much further in. I saw him clamber around Mordor (I think; it was mountainous at the very least) and then stealth around an Elven king's abode. It was... fine. Yes, I saw an early build and things could change, but I left that booth feeling a bit underwhelmed, in all honesty.\nRead more",

My personal highlight, though, was talking to the Pinny Arcade collectors during the show's official trading event.\r\n\n\r\nI’ll admit, before I went to PAX I didn’t really appreciate how big Pinny Arcade was. I’d definitely seen photos of colourful metal pins depicting characters from various video games fly across my screen as I browsed Twitter, but I had never thought much about them beyond that. I was shocked, then, to arrive at PAX and realise just how integral this collectable is to the show. Merch booths sell starter packs, individual demo stations flog game specific rarities and avid fans adorn their lanyards with their favourite pieces. It turns out, Pinny Arcade is huge. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Snímek vyvolá, zvětší, přidělá houslová efa, vše znovu vyfotí a pořídí první zvětšeninu, přičemž signuje tužkou svým jménem a letopočtem 1924. První komerční digitální fotoaparáty přijdou na trhu tři čtvrtě století poté, ona vlastně ani první kinofilmová Leica ještě není na světě, Kodak sotva představil světu první barevný film a uběhly pouhé tři roky od chvíle, kdy se Švédská královská akademie rozhodla udělit nobelovku Albertu Einsteinovi primárně za fotoeletrický jev, protože teorie relativity byla stále příliš bombastickou novátorskou myšlenkou, jakkoli experimentálně ověřenou právě za pomoci expedic s velkoformátovými fotoaparáty.",

          "description": "Punk's Not Red... or green, or pink, or...\nAs Squid Kids will be fully aware, the unique, bubblegum score of the Splatoon series is an important and distinct part of the online arena shooter series. This weekend, Nintendo dropped a funky-fresh sample from the upcoming Splatoon 3, giving us a sneak peek at the apocalyptic sequel's vibe.\nAs performed by in-universe garage band Front Roe, \"Sea Me Now\" is perhaps a little more Orange County than we are used to hearing from the sticky-icky world of Inkopolis. The new track has a distinct pop-punk sound which reflects the chaotic, graffiti-filled hues of a landscape wherein all of the rules have been abandoned. Don't worry, the utterly bizarre vocal style remains, weirder than ever.\nFeaturing a rockier vibe than Splatoon 2's more Hip-Hop oriented themes, it seems as if Splatoon 3 will feature a brand new sound accompanying its brand new look. Clearly, the new sequel will be going for a somewhat more anarchic vibe than its predecessors, (as anarchic as post-'00s pop-punk will allow, at any rate). This is all well and good, but I still wanna see my gals Pearl & Marina somewhere in the mix. I'm sure they'll be making a welcome cameo appearance at some point.\nSplatoon 3 launches September 9 on Nintendo Switch.\nhttps://twitter.com/NintendoEurope/status/1530473956137762816?s=20&t=xHsFK2uDY5sWzA4mbd11fw\nThe post Get your groove on with this funky-punky Splatoon 3 ‘choon appeared first on Destructoid.",

In addition, The Quarry boasts a recognizable cast of stars including David Arquette (Scream), Ariel Winter (Modern Family), Justice Smith (Jurassic World), Brenda Song (Dollface), Lance Henriksen (Aliens), Lin Shaye (A Nightmare on Elm Street), and more.\nThe Quarry launches on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms June 10.\nThe post Will you make the right choices in teen horror The Quarry? appeared first on Destructoid.",

Since then, PC Call of Duty players have been confined to playing the first-person-shooter series exclusively through Activision Blizzard's own Battle.net launcher.\nThe new image of CoD veteran character Ghost, (as spotted by Redditor Kalinine), has led the community to wonder whether this year's entry will finally see the storied Call of Duty franchise make its return to the Steam Store. It should be noted that the artwork in question was mysteriously removed from the storefront soon thereafter. Given that 2021's Call of Duty: Vanguard saw a weaker performance that the series typically receives, perhaps Activision is casting its net a little wider this year.\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare II launches October 28 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nYou can find an abridged timeline of Activision Blizzard's ongoing controversy, investigation, and company response right here.\nThe post Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II may see the franchise return to Steam appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Cubic Conundrum\nHamster has returned to the back catalog of veteran publisher Taito for this week's Arcade Archives entry — so get your brain in gear, as the classic cube-based puzzler Flipull has returned on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.\nReleased to arcades in 1989, before finding its way to a wide variety of home computers and consoles, Flipull, (or \"Flipull: An Exciting Cube Game\"), is a unique take on block-busting, tile-switching puzzlers of the time, and tasks the player with guiding a cute blob character up and down a ladder, throwing out symbol-covered cubes in order to clear out a horizontal playing field. The aim is to clear out rows of matching cubes, while then finding fresh chains for the spare cubes that are left behind. your only enemies are the clock, and some often dizzying background imagery.\nThis gameplay is better demonstrated in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Retro MGV.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iw3OukUwYJw\nWhen I first saw Flipull referenced as this week's Arcade Archives release, I had no idea what it was, but once I realized that it was renamed \"Plotting\" in the west, the memories came flooding back. I certainly remember Plotting, (and Taito's very similar tile-matcher, Puzznic), from my early gaming years. The cute puzzler is one of those gaming memories that remains locked away in the subconscious until a familiar flyer, magazine advert, or box art image magically opens up some long-discarded file in the brain. It's good to see it again after all of these decades.\nFlipull is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nThe post Taito’s Flipull joins the Arcade Archives and recalls a Plotting past appeared first on Destructoid.",

In the Sega Ages release, you can even turn off traffic, which brings about an even better sense of stress relief. After all, Out Run was more about driving than it was about racing. Get behind the wheel of your Ferrari and hit the open road.\nThere were many spin-offs to Out Run. Some of them were pretty strange, such as Out Run Europa.

          "description": "No more awkward post-fight goodbyes\nA new mod for Elden Ring aims to make co-op persist beyond the fog door, and it's going into beta this week. Modder LukeYui's seamless co-op mod for Elden Ring is going into public beta on May 27.\nYes, Elden Ring does already support co-op. But it is limited to certain areas and generally feels like it's meant for tackling bosses or tough areas, rather than exploring the Lands Between together. The seamless co-op mod for Elden Ring could change that.\nShown off in a video, LukeYui's mod allows for multiple players to ride their horses, get shared rewards from great enemies, and engage in PvP. Even when the host dies, they can spectate the other player.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHKuJO9nK-8\nThe mod will go live on NexusMods on May 27. No indication's been made towards how long it will stay up. But several alpha testers will also be streaming the co-op action. You can find their Twitch links in the mod's trailer description.\nThe Fellowship of the Elden Ring\nIt's a pretty cool thought that, if this mod pans out well, players could truly co-op great swathes of Elden Ring. While the drop-in co-op works right now, it's really only for spurts. Being able to run the entirety of an area, or just explore together, is something else entirely.\nOf course, Elden Ring has already been a hotbed for neat mods. Some let you summon bosses, or even infamous boss-killers. One project is trying to put FromSoftware's latest into the realm of virtual reality. And another went the hardware route, making a Fisher-Price controller work with Elden Ring.\nIt's safe to say Elden Ring is one of the year's biggest releases. As time rolls on though, I'm looking forward to more of what modders can do with the massive world FromSoft has made. And letting me and three of my friends engage in jolly co-op adventures is certainly a good pitch.\nThe post Elden Ring seamless co-op mod goes into beta this week appeared first on Destructoid.",

We reached out to Valve about the campaign at the time, but did not receive a response. IGN followed up with a massive report, detailing the extent of the bot…",

Starting now you can even trigger up a Diablo Immortal PC pre-load, and be ready for the June 2 launch while you peruse a new blog post that showcases a ton of details for what happens next week.\n\nThe post is fairly comprehensive, offering up full launch times, as well as all of the controllers that the game will support (the big ones are the Xbox One controllers and DualShock 3-4, as well as the DualSense — and the Switch Pro Controller in wired form or wirelessly via \"Mayflash Magic NS\").\nGlobally, the game will launch at 1PM ET on June 2, but the full global release calendar can be seen above (and again, Diablo Immortal PC pre-load is available now). The team reiterates that there are eight zones, as well as the following classes playable in the launch build: Barbarian, Crusader, Demon Hunter, Monk, Necromancer, or Wizard.\nIt'll feature cross-progression, so long as you log into your Battle.net account, which allows you to carry over progress from PC to mobile devices. Finally, here are the minimum and recommended PC requirements (with a note that \"ultra\" settings are only available on PC, or select iPad devices):\nMinimum Requirements For PC\nOperating System: Windows® 7 / Windows® 8 / Windows® 10 / Windows® 11 (64-bit)\nCPU: AMD FX-8100 or Intel Core i3\nGPU: NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 460, ATI Radeon™ HD 6850 or Intel® HD Graphics 530\nMemory: 4 GB RAM\nRecommended Specifications For PC\nOperating System: Windows® 10 / Windows® 11 (64-bit)\nCPU: Intel® Core i5 or AMD Ryzen™ 5\nGPU: NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 770 or AMD Radeon™ RX 470\nMemory: 8 GB RAM\n*Disk Space Requirement: 24GB\nThe post Diablo Immortal PC pre-load is available now, will support Switch Pro controller appeared first on Destructoid.",

Following on from an array of character trailers and a semi-successful beta test, the great-looking punchfest will finally launch on PlayStation and PC platforms June 28.\nTo help keep the fans' hype fires stoked, Nexon released a short new trailer taking a look at the title's single-player options. Those of you who don't feel like throwing down with friends or strangers in rollback-based online matches will instead be able to lock horns with the CPU in Free Battle (essentially Offline Vs.), Arcade Mode, in which your chosen character takes on a series of player-chosen opponents, and Survival, where you can test your mettle against an endless run of enemies, cashing out your score for a variety of health, damage, and meter buffs between fights.\nThese all seem like mighty fine ways to get acquainted with DNF Duel's exciting roster of characters.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JY1H30c_TdA&t\nIn addition to the above modes, it should be noted that DNF Duel also includes its own individual Story Mode, which uses comic book-style panels and a rotational cast of characters to tell a new chapter in the Dungeon Fighter Online universe. Once you've held your own in these offline battles, I would not be surprised if you do not have a potential main character or two and will perhaps be getting ready to step up to plate for one of DNF Duel's rollback netcode-powered showdowns.\nDNF Duel launches June 28 on PlayStation and PC platforms. And while you wait for its impending arrival, you have enough time to check out the character trailers for Berserker, Grappler, Hitman, Inquisitor, Striker, Ranger, Dragon Knight, Vanguard, Kunoichi, Crusader, and Ghostblade.\nWho you got?\nThe post DNF Duel ‘single’ modes include Story, Arcade, and Survival appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A few minor fixes just came out\nA new N64 on Switch patch was recently released alongside of Kirby 64, and some sneaky dataminers have managed to once again uncover some invisible patch notes. Most famously, Nintendo fixed the fog in Ocarina of Time, which was one of the most egregious emulation releases in some time, and one of myriad errors.\nOver on Twitter, Switch \"tinkerer\" and Dolphin contributor OatmealDome figured out a basic patch notes rundown for the update, titled \"version 2.3.0:\"\nKirby 64 added\nStar Fox 64 had gamma adjustment enabled — gamma value was set to 1.8.\nDr. Mario 64 had renderer settings adjusted (“ConstValue_0” added)\nMario Golf had renderer settings adjusted (“ConstValue_1” added).\nIn short, you can see the results of the render fixing in the N64 on Switch patch here, and the gamma adjustment for Star Fox 64 is more obviously apparent. OatmealDome also notes that Kirby 64 is actually the least-touched N64 game to date, stating, \"Kirby 64 appears to have the least amount of patches and hacks that I’ve seen so far for this emulator. There are the usual renderer settings adjustments present, but there are no CPU instruction patches or hooks.\"\nWith that in mind, Kirby 64 also has a soft lock bug that will need to be addressed in the future. It occurs in underwater stages in specific conditions, but it's something for Nintendo to note nonetheless.\n[Update: Nintendo has acknowledged the Kirby 64 issue in a recent tweet, calling it a \"bug that can prevent players progressing under a certain condition.\" The patch is scheduled to arrive \"early next week.\" For Nintendo, this is a pretty fast response!]\nhttps://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1530202669511593985\nThe post Nintendo continues to patch and fix N64 on Switch games (Update) appeared first on Destructoid.",

There are no Expansion Pack offerings (Genesis/N64) this week.\nFollowing a maintenance announcement that most certainly tipped folks off that more games would be coming, Nintendo unleashed three new games into the mix:\nCongo's Caper (SNES)\nRival Turf (SNES)\nPinball (NES)\nPinball will likely trigger some nostalgia, but it's been far surpassed in the arena — despite being one of the first home console pinball games in 1984 (just five years later we'd get Pinball Quest). Rival Turf is a serviceable beat 'em up that's part of the Rushing Beat saga, and joins the already existing Brawl Brothers on the Switch Online service.\nBut Congo's Caper is the real star here of the weekly SNES Switch Online drops, at least for me. I remember renting it because of a gaming magazine feature, and I couldn't be happier. As one of many \"dinosaur/prehistoric\"-angled games of that era (and the preceding NES generation), it had a vibrant visual style that still sticks out; a wild plotline involving demon kidnappers; and a protagonist that evolves and devolves from a monkey to a boy as part of the gameplay (similar to Ghosts'N Goblins).\nAlongside of a good platforming foundation, the stark aesthetic style and goofy premise will still hold up today for a lot of people: give it a shot!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_-LqmGv7ig\nThe post Underrated SNES game Congo’s Caper comes to Switch Online appeared first on Destructoid.",

That’s because in the canonized novel Star Wars: Brotherhood, which is about the relationship between Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, a reference to Blitzball being played in a local lake is made. How do we know it’s the Blitzball from Final Fantasy X? Well, the author of Brotherhood, Mike Chen, is the person who revealed this fun detail, as reported by GamesRadar. \n#6: There's a reference to a sport called Blitzball played in a local lake. Blitzball is basically underwater hockey played as a minigame in Final Fantasy X. As a former NHL writer, I freaking loved Blitzball and spent hours winning leagues. pic.twitter.com/uad4uIMcrA\nMay 17, 2022\nAs you can see, it seems Chen was a big enough fan of the sport that he included a reference to it in his canon Star Wars novel. Does someone have a lightsaber that looks like Caladbolg, though? \nIf you’re interested in other Brotherhood easter eggs such as this, Chen has an entire thread dedicated to them on Twitter. \nFor more about Star Wars, watch the new trailer for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, which is the sequel to Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, and then watch this new Star Wars: The Bad Batch Season 2 trailer.

There’s no shortage of asymmetrical games you can jump into right now if you want to hone your skills or build up anticipation for soon-to-be-released titles.\n  \n\n\n\n      \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nDead by Daylight\nPlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, Stadia, PC, iOS, Android\nIt’s hard to talk asymmetrical multip…",

          "description": "Hot off an exciting weekend of tons of news from Star Wars Celebration 2022, including the reveal of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor and details about The Mandalorian and Ahsoka, a new trailer for Season 2 of Star Wars: The Bad Batch has arrived. \nIn it, we get new looks at the Bad Batch, of course, as well as Darth Sidious aka The Emperor and Wookiee Jedi youngling Gungi. With a look at Gungi, we now know that he survived Order 66, which sought to kill and end the entirety of the Jedi. The trailer also reveals that we can expect Season 2 of The Bad Batch to drop onto Disney+ this fall. \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, the titular Bad Batch of heroes are still doing their thing, searching for what they want to do now that they’re free. Of course, meanwhile, Sheev Palpatine’s empire is on the rise and the crew will need to deal with that while extending their helping hands to others. It looks like they’re after new allies, too, which hopefully includes Gungi. \nFor more about Star Wars, read about the newly announced series, Star Wars: Skeleton Crew, which will star Jude Law, and then read about how the Rogue One prequel series, Andor, will hit Disney+ in August. After that, check out the first ever Star Wars Jedi: Survivor trailer. \nAre you excited for Season 2 of Star Wars: The Bad Batch? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "Everyone has that Elden Ring boss they really enjoyed facing off against, even if they kicked your butt over and over again, including the game’s director and From Software CEO Hidetaka Miyazaki. \nHis favorite boss is Starscourge Radahn, according to a new Xbox Wire Japan blog post, as translated by IGN. As for why, the famed director cites Radahn’s alluring design as a character in The Lands Between as well as the festival surrounding him. \n\n\n“It’s tough to decide, but I’d have to say Radahn,” Miyazaki said. “As an individual character, he’s really alluring, and I really like the Radahn Festival situation. There’s a literal sense of festivity and exuberance, but also a unique tinge of sadness and loneliness.” \nHe said when he first brought up the idea of Radahn and his festival, “no one on the team took it seriously,” which is extra funny considering this boss is Miyazaki’s favorite. He added that his next favorite bosses after Radahn are Godrick, the Grafted and Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy. He also said one of his favorite designs out of anything in the game is the 12-fingered Caria Manor hand spiders, because of course (they still give me the heebie-jeebies). \n“Spider Hand is one of my favorite designs,” Miyazaki said in the Xbox Wire Japan post. “It’s something you don’t want to even look at because it’s so horrible. I wonder if the way to overcome your issue is to face it head on and beat it.” \n\n\nI was more of a “oohp, there’s one of those hand spider things so I’m going to turn around now” kind of player. \nFor more, read about this Elden Ring mod that lets you party up with NPCs and bosses like Malenia and then check out Game Informer’s Elden Ring review to find out why we gave it a 10 out of 10.

Nintendo describes \"Sea Me Now\" by in-universe band Front Roe as having \"a melodious, punkish sound\" that has been \"swimming up the charts in Splatville lately.\" True to the description, the track veers closer to what we had in the first Splatoon's soundtrack, though with decidedly more of a punk-rock edge.\nYou can listen to \"Sea Me Now\" by Front Roe below.\n\n\nThe Splatoon series has long been known for its music, even including its in-universe artists as main characters. In the original Splatoon, pop duo Callie and Marie (AKA the Squid Sisters) ran down the news at the start of each play session, while Splatoon 2 introduced us to Pearl and Marina (AKA Off The Hook). We don't know who the figurehead announcers of Splatoon 3 will be as of this writing.\nSplatoon 3 comes to Switch on September 9.

Its 20+ year history began after series creator Hideki Kaimya attempted to create an installment of another legendary Capcom series, and instead birthed the prototype of the modern character action game (or \"Stylish Action\"). In this new season, we'll be covering the development and devilish narratives of all of the DMC titles, including Ninja Theory's reboot. Dante, black-haired Dante, Virgil, Sparda, Trish, Nero, Lady, V; all of your favorite characters are going to be there! Here's the complete list of games we'll be talking about in the coming weeks:\nDevil May Cry\nDevil May Cry 2\nDevil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening\nDevil May Cry 4\nDmC: Devil May Cry\nDevil May Cry 5\nVideo Gameography is a podcast hosted by Game Informer Associate Editors Marcus Stewart and John Carson. Each season is a deep dive into a specific video game series, with each episode exploring the year of release, development, and narrative for a single game in that storied franchise. We're joined by a special guest every episode to help break down our thoughts on the topic that week and have a few laughs along the way. \nLast season, we broke from the mold established from our Metroid, Halo, Uncharted, and Bioshock seasons by covering the Gameography of a single development studio, Supergiant Games. Check out the episodes for Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, and Hades to catch up on the show before we initiate our Devil Trigger and take a stab at Devil May Cry. \nListen and subscribe to Video Gameography on your favorite podcast service.

This role-playing game was originally released on Xbox in 2004 and later found its way to PC. You'll now have the chance to play it again on your TV or take it on the go on Switch for just $15.\nThe Sith Lords is set during a dark period for the Republic. As a Jedi in exile, you could bring stability to the Jedi Order and help the Republic, or embrace the dark side of the Force and help a new order take command. This sequel embraces player choice in meaningful and fun ways, allowing you to form tight bonds with your teammates and pick how you wield the Force.\nWe recently ranked The Sith Lords as the fifth best Star Wars game in our Top 30 Star Wars Games list, saying \"Although development switched studios from BioWare to Obsidian Entertainment, the choice-driven bliss of the original Knights of the Old Republic RPG is alive and well in Sith Lords. Picking up five years after the fall of Lord Malak, the Sith Lords is another finely penned tale that offers deeper dialogue options, another great cast of characters, and plenty of alignment-specific variables.\"",

BD-1's legs move, his head tilts, and you can open a tray that holds healing cannisters. Lego also included a display plaque that comes with a BD-1 minifigure. Now all we need is a smaller set that gives us a Cal Kestis minifigure. The BD-1 set retails for $99.99. You can see it in all of its glory in the images below:\nLego also gave us our first look at a forthcoming set based on Andor, a new Disney Plus series slated to release later this year.

The latest Star Wars collectible announced introduces a new character, and it's unlike anything we've seen in the Star Wars universe. This odd companion appears to be this year's Grogu, and will be turned into a variety of collectibles that will be released this holiday season.\nThese announcements were made today by toy manufacturer Hasbro, and happened during Star Wars Celebration, a four-day event held in Anaheim, Calif.\nThe trailers for Obi-Wan Kenobi implied Old Ben would be keeping an eye on Luke Skywalker, but the show is more about his sister at this point. When we first meet Leia, we see she has a companion droid named LOLA (L0-LA59). This tiny, hovering droid is transforming into three different collectibles, one offering functionality that mimics the movements and sounds from the show.\nHasbro's animatronic edition features a touch sensor on LOLA's head that can activate over 45 different light, sound, and movement options. This version retails for $89.99 and will be released in the fall.\nHasbro's second LOLA offering is an interactive electronic figure that also offers lights and sounds, but lacks the movements. This figure is highly poseable, however, allowing for the panels on LOLA's back to be positioned in different ways. This figure releases this summer for $39.99.\nHasbro's final announcement ties in with the Grogu Bounty Collection. You can add two small LOLA toys to your shelves, each showing off the droid's personality in different ways. This series of figures will be joined by other figures based on R2-D2, BD-1, and Grogu. Hasbro is targeting a fall release for them.",

A passionate group of fans has long pleaded with developer Valve to address the issue, and the company has finally responded. \nYesterday, the official Team Fortress 2 Twitter account posted a message in response to #SaveTF2, a peaceful campaign of fans working to raise awareness about the game’s rampant bot problem. Basically, bot programs have made the game nearly unplayable for some since they’ll instantly kill players upon loading up into match-ups, giving the bots users an unfair advantage. TF2 players have become increasingly vocal about the problem, but Valve has remained largely silent on the issue (even going quiet on the game’s forums) until posting the following message: \nTF2 community, we hear you! We love this game and know you do, too. We see how large this issue has become and are working to improve things.\nMay 26, 2022\nValve doesn’t elaborate on how it plans to tackle the problem or when to expect a solution but getting the notoriously quiet company to respond is an accomplishment and measure of relief for Team Fortress 2 fans. Hopefully, it results in a substantial response that comes sooner rather than later.",

          "description": "A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. \nThe game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. \nWatch on Twitch!\nFallen Order was released on November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. \nJoin Marcus Stewart, Andrew Reiner, and John Carson on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat.

          "description": "When Jurassic World: Dominion opens in theaters in two weeks, we’ll see what happens when dinosaurs walk among us. Odds are most humans will be turned into tasty dinosaur snacks, but we probably won’t go down without a fight. Jurassic World Evolution 2 players can download a new expansion that adds some of the movie’s new dinosaurs to their parks on the same day. The Dominion Biosyn expansion adds the Gigantosaurus, Dreadnoughtus, Pyroraptor, Quetzalcoatlus, Therizinosaurus, and the long-overdue Dimetrodon.\nThe Gigantosaurs’ behavior in Dominion is apparently modeled after The Dark Knight’s Joker. This odd inspiration point was revealed by the movie’s director Colin Trevorrow in an interview with Empire Magazine. “I wanted something that felt like the Joker,” he said. “It just wants to watch the world burn.” We’ll have to wait to see just how much of that destructive quality comes out in the game’s version of the beast.\nThe arrival of dinosaurs is just a tiny part of this expansion, which offers a new ‘what if’ campaign inspired by the forthcoming motion picture. This campaign allows players to add new buildings to their parks, as well as a variety of new species, some of which are feathered. Existing dinosaurs will also get new skins. The new story unfolds through a variety of characters, including Claire Dearing (voiced by Bryce Dallas Howard), Dr. Alan Grant (voiced by Sam Neill), Dr. Ellie Sattler (voiced by Laura Dern), and Lewis Dodgson (voiced by Campbell Scott).\nOther new features for the park include an underground Hyper Loop transportation network, invisible fences, and new vehicles and decorations. All of it can be used in the Sandbox.\nFrontier Developments calls this expansion its biggest yet, and it’s slated to release on June 14.",

          "description": "Sony has announced a new State of Play scheduled to air next Thursday, June 2 at 3 p.m. Pacific/6 p.m. Eastern. \nThe PlayStation Blog states the event will run for 30 minutes and showcases “exciting reveals from our third-party partners.” The post doesn’t mention first-party at all, so it sounds like we shouldn’t expect updates on games like God of War: Ragnarok, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, or the rumored remake of The Last of Us.\nSony also teases that viewers will get a “sneak peek” into PlayStation VR2 games. Just yesterday it was confirmed the headset will launch with over 20 games. The only announced title is Horizon: Call of the Wild, though that project may not appear if the event is highlighting third parties. At that point, it’s anyone’s guess as to what PS VR2 software we’ll see.\nThe last State of Play took place in March, which brought the reveals of games like Valkyrie Elysium, Exoprimal, and Gundam Evolution. Given that this could be Sony’s only real presence during June’s onslaught of game showcases, it hopefully has some heavy-hitters, even if they won’t be coming from its first-party studios. \nWe recently shared our own predictions on PlayStation reveals this summer during this week’s Game Informer Show podcast.

As of today, that’s no longer the case.\nGlen Schofield, The Callisto Protocol’s creative director, took to Twitter to announce that the game now unfolds within its own story and fiction and not PUBG’s. \nFYI @CallistoTheGame is its own story and world. It no longer takes place in the PUBG Universe. It was originally part of the PUBG timeline, but grew into its own world.

          "description": "No stranger to Star Wars or the annual celebration happening right now in Anaheim, CA, Harrison Ford made a surprise appearance at the Lucasfilm Showcase today, but he didn't show up for a space-faring adventure this time around. Instead, he arrived to promote another Lucasfilm franchise he stars in by the name of Indiana Jones and dropped the big news of a 2023 release date for the next film installment.\nFord's segment started with a musical introduction by longtime Star Wars and Indy composer John Williams (who celebrated his 90th birthday in February) playing him onto the stage. Ford spoke about working on the new Indian Jones film and how it was nearing completion. \"I had a wonderful experience working with James Mangold,\" said Ford, according to a Tweet from Decider. \"I am really proud of the movie that we made. So I'll be seeing you around campus.\"\nFord says they've almost finished the next Indy film. \"I had a wonderful experience working with James Mangold,\" who is also here. \"I am really proud of the movie that we made. So I'll be seeing you around campus.\"\nMay 26, 2022\nBefore leaving the stage, Harrison Ford dropped potentially the biggest bit of information from today's panel: Indiana Jones 5 will be released in theaters on June 30, 2023. How about that for a final segment surprise?\nRight now the plot and title of Indy 5 are under wraps, but the IMDB page for the film is full of exciting faces joining Harrison Ford on the next great adventure. The page lists Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Mads Mikkelsen, Toby Jones, Shaunette Renée Wilson, and more joining the cast.\nIn 2023, Harrison Ford returns as the legendary #IndianaJones. Check out this first look of the new James Mangold-directed film. pic.twitter.com/ALs82tsmXw\nMay 26, 2022\nFollowing the announcement, the folks behind the Indiana Jones Twitter account posted the first image of the film of Jones crossing what looks to be an old, rickety bridge in a dark cave.

          "description": "Star Wars Celebration began today with a panel showing with a showcase of the projects Lucasfilm is working on, and the new Star Wars series Andor had the spotlight after the cast of Obi-Wan Kenobi left the stage. Not only was there a brief interview with the show's cast and crew, but a teaser trailer debuted along with the release date on Disney+ of August 31.\nThe teaser trailer shown is musically paced with anvil-like percussion and throat-singing casting the theme of the footage. Focusing on the growing tension between the rebellious citizens and the overbearing Empire, Andor will depict the five years of Cassian Andor's life prior to the events of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. The trailer shows those citizens preparing for conflict with imperial forces while Diego Luna's Andor voices his displeasure with the Empire over the footage. We, of course, see Cassian Andor sneaking around, but also a new look at Genevieve O'Reilly returning as Mon Mothma, who last played this role in Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith. Peppered throughout are shots of a lush forest, a stark white base set in a body of water, and a large futuristic city that is most likely Coruscant.\n“We’re going to rewind 5 years back from #RogueOne. We’ve already shot 12 episodes!“ - Tony Gilroy #StarWarsCelebration #Andor\nMay 26, 2022\nThe opening panel for this year's Celebration wasn't streamed, but plenty of news has come from the panel via the Star Wars official Twitter account. Executive Producer Tony Gilroy said that 12 episodes of Andor have already been shot for the premiere this fall, and twelve more episodes will encompass a second season that will lead directly into the events of Rogue One.\nAndor will be streaming exclusively on Disney+, and its premiere on August 31 will include the first two episodes of the series.\n[Source: Decider]",

While you’ll be able to brave the cinematic horrors with friends in person on launch day, the game’s online play has been delayed.\nThe studio tweeted a message stating that it’s delaying The Quarry’s online multiplayer to no later than July 8. That’s roughly a month after the game’s June 10 launch. Supermassive explains the move was made to ensure the rest of the game, such as its single-player and local co-op, is as polished as possible by the release date.\nAn update on The Quarry's online multiplayer: pic.twitter.com/Bipo0yxp2g\nMay 26, 2022\nThe full statement reads as follows:\nWhile a bummer, one would assume Supermassive’s other option was to delay The Quarry entirely, and it chose what it deemed the lesser of two evils. The game stars a group of teenage summer camp counselors who find themselves hunted by dangerous locals and another mysterious threat. Like Until Dawn and the Dark Pictures Anthology, players are presented with a myriad of choices that cause the story to branch in several ways – so much so that The Quarry apparently has 186 unique endings. The Quarry stars an ensemble cast that features David Arquette, Lin Shaye, Ted Raimi, Ariel Winter, Brenda Song, Justice Smith, and others. \nThe Quarry will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Supermassive recently released footage of the game’s first 30 minutes that you can watch here.

Among his most memorable roles is Henry Hill in Goodfellas and Shoeless Joe Jackson in Field of Dreams. In recent years, Liotta has had a resurgence in Hollywood with roles in Marriage Story, the Amazon Prime series Hanna, and multiple other projects in the works, including a film called Cocaine Bear and a series called Blackbird, that will, unfortunately, see the light of day without him around. \nAlthough his impact on the film industry is great, Ray Liotta also made a profound statement in video games, starring as Tommy Vercetti in Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. At the time, having veteran Hollywood talent in video games was a novel concept, expanded upon in the years following due in part to Liotta's portrayal of Vercetti. Vice City was an instant hit when it was released in 2002, receiving many awards, including Game Informer's 2002 Game of the Year. It's sold over 17 million copies according to a Take Two earnings report from 2008.\nLiotta leaves behind his daughter, Karsen, and his fiancée, Jacy Nitollo.

You play the role of a seasoned dinosaur handler who wants to protect the dinosaurs. These efforts will pit you against poachers, mercenaries, and scientists looking to create deadly hybrids. This free-to-play action/adventure experience will release for iOS and Android devices soon.\nThe top-down gameplay pushes you to rescue and collect dinosaurs, and also use them for battle against other prehistoric beasts and hostile human forces. The dinosaurs can also be used to aid you in battle.  Pteranodons drop supply crates, and the Triceratops can ram through objects.\n“Jurassic World Primal Ops lets players immerse themselves in the Jurassic World franchise, allowing them to deepen their connection with dinosaurs in thrilling, new ways,” said Jim Molinets, SVP of Production at Universal Games and Digital Platforms. “The game is reflective of the brand’s signature storytelling, intense action, compelling environments, and diverse characters, and promises to be engaging for new and long-time fans alike.”\nThe game will feature in-app purchases and features many of the dinosaurs that will debut in Jurassic World Dominion, a movie slated to open in theaters on June 10. Check out the trailer above and the images below to see what awaits you in Primal Ops. If you are in the market for a dinosaurs experience right now, Jurassic World Evolution 2 is quite good and with over 70 dinosaurs to place and interact with within your own theme park.",

The Uncharted movie garnered a strong opening weekend, The Last of Us is getting a highly-anticipated HBO adaptation, and a Jak and Daxter film is in the works. Now the God of War (live-action), Horizon, and Gran Turismo television shows are in development. \nSony has officially announced new PlayStation Productions Series in Development\npic.twitter.com/5b3nkD9diF\nMay 26, 2022\nVGC reports that Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO Tony Vinciquerra confirmed the creation of the three shows during a recent business briefing. Amazon has the streaming rights to God of War while Horizon is slated for a Netflix release. However, no streaming service is connected to Gran Turismo (see Benji-Sales’ tweet above). There’s no launch date set for any of the shows seeing as how development was just announced.\nIn other video game adaptation news, the Sonic The Hedgehog 2 movie dropped earlier this week on Paramount Plus.

On June 4, players are invited to experience a timed event called \"Collision.\" This story-driven moment can only be played once and will kick off at 4 p.m. ET. Epic Games says the fate of the Zero point will be decided in this gameplay event, which I believe will lead into Chapter 3, Season 3.\nThe events in Fortnite are always fun, as they shake up the gameplay, change the environments, and introduce new characters to the battle royale universe. Collision hits just a week after Obi-Wan Kenobi is introduced. A mysterious tower has also appeared in the center of the island.\nEpic Games is encouraging streamers and players to record the event, as it won't be repeated. The last event brought us The Foundation (played by Dwayne Johnson) and Spider-Man. The island also flipped over and gave us an entirely new map to discover. What will happen this time? The teaser image above gives us a taste of a monstrous return.\nIf you have the Battle Pass, you have just one week to complete it and get Doctor Strange (and his alternate costumes in the bonus tier). Fly through the missions you can for big XP bumps.\nIf you log in at any point on June 4 after 8 a.m. ET, you'll receive an exclusive loading screen and lobby track for Collision. You'll be able to log into the Collision lobby 30 minutes before the event begins.\nWhat do you hope to see from Season 3? Any character skins you are hoping to see added or return?",

In Fall 2021, Sony CFO Hiroki Totoki outlined plans to invest more heavily in console semiconductor shortages linked to the pandemic. But according to Eurogamer, component scarcity isn't the only thing catalyzing the new-gen deficit. The Russia-Ukraine war has also affected part inventory. In a financial presentation conducted yesterday, Sony CEO Jim Ryan stated that PS4 sales continue to be higher than those of the PS5. However, the shortages are expected to stabilize and overtake PS4 sales by 2024. \nIn the image above, you can see the PS5 projections. In year one, the PS5 outsold the PS4, in year two, it undersold the PS4 due to supply constraints, in year three, the gap is expected to close, and by year four onwards, the PS5 is expected to overtake its predecessor again. This, of course, won't be easy. Sony has two plans to help expedite the gradual sale increase: source several suppliers for greater stability and facilitate logistical negotiations to maintain optimal delivery routes. \nMatt Miller awarded the PlayStation 5 an A- in his review of the console and stated:\n\"The PlayStation 5 is an incredibly powerful and sophisticated piece of gaming hardware, sometimes virtually eliminating the tedium of loading screens that have plagued console gaming for decades. Games look amazing thanks to new lighting techniques, especially on 4K displays, and a proprietary sound engine ensures an equally arresting aural experience. While its outward aesthetic is attractive, it's also overpowering, and the design won't please everyone. A slick dashboard is easy to use and smartly designed and values what's important to you, most especially your leisure time.\"\nHopefully, we'll all get our hands on the new-gen Sony console we deserve as we grow closer to a future where stronger hardware takes precedence.\n[Source: Eurogamer]",

The MMORPG was released in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan last year but is finally available in North America on mobile devices and PC starting today. You can watch the animation trailer below. \n\n\nLike the main installments before it – namely, Wrath of the White Witch and Revenant Kingdom – Cross Worlds is composed by the legendary Joe Hisaishi and features Studio Ghibli-animated cutscenes. According to the Ni no Kuni website, the story is as follows: \n“You are about to enter a brand new world in the virtual reality game Soul Divers. But as you explore and become stronger, you’ll realize this world is not a virtual one. A mysterious girl named Rania entrusts you with a mission: Rebuild your kingdom ransacked by powerful foes  and save the two connected worlds from certain destruction!” \nFor all you anime fans out there, Cross World’s central narrative seems directly inspired by the isekai genre. The animation trailer above reveals that the new Ni no Kuni still brims with the whimsy and eccentricity that the franchise is known for. Moreover, the high-fantasy overtones and vivid art style make a welcome return. \nKim Wallace had lukewarm feelings on Wrath of the White Witch, but Joe Juba awarded Revenant Kingdom an 8 out of 10 and stated:\n“Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom may not nail everything it attempts, but it gets the important things right. Building your kingdom is satisfying and engaging, even with the weak narrative hooks. The cycle of rewards became an obsession, and had me staying up late to recruit just one more ally, or complete just one more upgrade. Combat could be tighter, and other supporting elements could use some polish – but like any kingdom, this experience isn’t about individual contributions. It’s about how those contributions come together, and the fun of this experience as a whole outweighs its flaws.”\n\n\nHopefully, Cross World will garner positive reception too.",

Them’s Fightin’ Herds is a spiritual successor to Fighting is Magic, an unlicensed fighting game based on the popular My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic series created by fans of the show (who appropriately call themselves Mane6). A big “cease and desist” from Hasbro forced halted Fighting is Magic's launch, forcing Mane6 to rework the idea into an original title. However, Lauren Faust, the mastermind of Friendship Is Magic, admired the project and lent her artistic talents to design Them’s Fightin’ Herds’ colorful cast of four-legged combatants. \n\n\nThem’s Fightin’ Herds sports a streamlined 4-button fighting system complete with combos (and juggle decay), a magic system, and super attacks. Players can duke it out in local and online versus modes, and an episodic story mode modeled as a classic top-down RPG features side quests and boss fights. The experience also boasts cross-platform matchmaking, rollback netcode, a replay system to rewatch matches, and a dynamic soundtrack that changes based on the characters. The game has been positively received since launching on Steam in 2020 and has amassed a dedicated following, with organized tournaments taking place at events such as EVO. \nThe console reveal news also comes alongside the announcement of a Season 1 Pass that introduces four new fighters, additional stages, and cosmetics. This pass can be purchased separately and is included in a $39.99 Deluxe Edition of the game. Otherwise, the base game runs for $19.99. \nThem’s Fightin’ Herds will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch at an undisclosed date. Physical versions of the Deluxe Edition are in the works by Maximum Games Store, set to launch within the same timeframe. You can pre-order a copy here.",

Now, End Global 7 has revealed that it’s been canceled. \nThis news comes by way of Eurogamer, which first reported on End Global 7’s statement released today. In that statement, the company says it is re-evaluating things such as risk profiles, investments, and portfolio strategies and that development of Daybreak Games Marvel MMO has ceased as a result. \n“EG7 today announced it will be discontinuing the development of the Marvel project at Daybreak Games,” the statement reads. “Based on the re-evaluation of the development risk profile, size of investment, and the long-term product portfolio strategy for the group, the board has decided to change the development priorities and reallocate resources within the group to focus on alternative long-term projects.”\nEG7 had planned to invest more than SEK 500 million ($50.5 million) in the Marvel project over the next three years. The company will now instead “diversify” this investment across multiple smaller projects within the studio group. This includes previously announced upgrades to The Lord of the Rings Online and DC Universe Online, as well as “new game opportunities with our first party, original IPs.” \nIt sounds like EG7 has washed its hands of Marvel, or vice versa, to some extent as it does not seem a Marvel game is in the publisher’s future. For more, read about the graphics upgrade and massive expansion coming to DC Universe Online in 2023. \n[Source: Eurogamer]",

However, beyond that, Leviathan also introduces a roguelike experience to play through. \n\n\n“[Leviathan] is very different to anything we’ve done before,” a press release reads. “It is more roguellike, with players caught in a time-loop. Players start together on an expedition, and each time they die, they lose their progress, but help the community try to break free from this loop together.\n“Difficulty has been turned up in a vairety of ways, but every death means a reset of the loop and a new proc-gen loadout. To make it easier to complete the eventual goal of breaking out of the loop with just one life, the community can work together on a persistent, global goal that permanently improves the quality and frequency of upgrade rewards found during each loop.”\n\nThe story of Leviathan reveals itself as players work alongside Specialist Polo and the actual Leviathan, “a large and imposing space creature shrouded in myth and mystery.” Those who undertake this expedition can earn rewards like The Whalestalker cloak, a mini Organic Frigate for your base, a Temporal Starship Trail, and more. Hello Games says the ultimate reward, however, is the first ever living frigate – an imposing tentacled beast – which will be your very own Space Whale to add to your freighter fleet. \nYou can view the full patch notes for Leviathan here.\nAre you going to be checking out Leviathan today?

However, in just a few months, it will finally launch into 1.0 on consoles and PC. \nMore specifically, Temtem 1.0 will go live on Sep. 6 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Temtem has already been available to play on PS5 and PC so today’s news in terms of platforms is that it’s coming to Xbox and Switch in September. To celebrate the news, developer Crema has released a new trailer showcasing what to expect in 1.0. \n\n\nThat includes a new endgame island and much more in-game. Pre-order links for Switch aren’t yet live, but on Xbox, there’s a standard edition you can pre-order and a deluxe edition. The latter includes “bonus cosmetic content (to be revealed at a later date) – available when Temtem launches.” If you prefer to buy your games physically, you can do that too because there will be both a standard physical edition of the game and a Temtem collector’s edition as well. \n“Crafted with care by Crema, Humble Games, and Final Boss Bundle, it contains a lovely diorama statue and a set of enamel pins of our oldest partners, the starters,” a press release reads. “Want to immerse yourself further into the world of Archipelago? It also includes a Temcard replica of fan-favorites Kinu, Gharunder, and Shuine, and a set of three irresistible embroidered patches that will make you feel like you’re part of the Narwhal Crew.”\nHowever, this bundle does not include the game. You can pre-order the collector’s edition, as well as additional Temtem merch, here.

          "description": "A few days ago, Google announced the list of students accepted for this year's Google Summer of Code.\nWe are very proud to welcome 4 students this year who will be working on various parts of the project during the upcoming months.\nPragyansh Chaturvedi (aka Raikou) will work on improving our DIRECTOR engine. His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh's main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.\nMichael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.\nEmanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.\nAvijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet's task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.\nThe team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.\nPlease give a warm welcome to our new students! Let's make GSoC 2022 a huge success – together!\n>",
