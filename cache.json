Perhaps it’s a jaunty farm sim like Stardew Valley or Story of Seasons, a laid-back puzzler like Unpacking, or even a cute adventure like A Short Hike. The point is that many of us have preconceived notions of what a relaxing game should look like, but if Ryan Janes’ ‘The Most Relaxing Video Games’ book is anything to go by, then blissful relaxation can potentially be found in the most unlikely genres imaginable.\nPublished by White Owl, an imprint of Pen & Sword Books (which has also published books from the likes of Kirk McKeand and Chris Scullion), ‘The Most Relaxing Video Games’ immediately struck us as being geared toward those who perhaps don’t consider gaming to be their primary hobby. Indeed, for those of us at Nintendo Life, our first glimpse of the book consisted of casually flicking through the pages while muttering “Yep… Yep…” under our breath as we cross checked each entry with our own internally curated list.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

What's particularly interesting with this one is that developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has clearly taken inspiration from either Sonic or Marvel's 'Infinity Gauntlet' story arc, as it seems to entail a powerful artefact known as the 'Legendary Banana' which is accesible after collecting seven coloured gems.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

We wholeheartedly agree.\nUndoubtedly one of the most divisive Zelda games in the franchise, Majora's Mask is cited as either the very best that Nintendo has to offer, or derided for its polarising use of time loops.

But one Dragon Quest fan sought to preserve all DLC for the 3DS remake of Dragon Quest VII — and they did it just in time.\nGronya, a Dragon Quest enthusiast and content creator, has preserved all 56 DLC maps — known as 'tablets' in the game. These tablets are only accessible after completing the third island (at the earliest) with a handful locked to the post-game. Dragon Quest VII isn't a short RPG, so trying to power through it before downloading all of them isn't that easy.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Josh is doggedly pursuing something he’s called “The Cure” which he believes will save his family, though all his family sees is a man increasingly consumed and isolated by his ‘research’. The thing is, Josh has seemingly discovered the multiverse and a way of jumping into neighboring realities. This has left his mind profoundly broken, unable to easily discern between memory and reality after crossing dimensions. So, you set out to put together all the pieces and try to make sense not just of where Josh has come from, but where he may go if this cure he’s been after isn’t so fictional after all.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It's 2D, side on platforming, and super colourful. Think Dead Cells skinned as a kids cartoon with a branded cereal tie-in, extremely cool music, and an emphasis on wall running.

I've always felt like last year's Darkest Dungeon 2 was secretly one of them. Rather than simply building on the previous game's premise of a Hamlet's worth of upgradeable, derangeable heroes venturing into tabletop RPG-style labyrinths, it stripped away Darkest Dungeon's skin and moved its bones and organs around to create a gruelling roguelike. Well, developers Red Hook appear to have done it again with Darkest Dungeon 2's free Kingdoms mode, out later this year, which slices open Darkest Dungeon 2's hide and recomposes it into a turn-based strategy boardgame, where you defend a world map against encroaching eldritch creatures.\nRead more",

I've given it some thought, and I think the answer is: \"has more money and status than most indies, but not, like, Call of Duty levels, and also one of our partners is Gearbox Publishing, so this is perhaps ‘indie’ in the Geoff Keighley sense.\"\nDon’t expect any of Keighley's beloved Kojima interludes or dance numbers in this one, however.

          "description": "Drop Bear Bytes, the studio behind post-apocalyptic RPG Broken Roads, are named after Australia’s deadliest creature. The Drop Bear might look like a normal koala, but they’re actually dangerous predators, fond of jumping from trees to maul unsuspecting chumps who forget to take adequate precautions, like urinating on themselves. Really, the story is a wind-up the aussies like to blag tourists with. If it looks like a koala, it’s just a koala. But it’s this sort of character, inspired by love for Australia’s unique landscape, culture and good-natured mick-taking, that forms the heart of the best bits in Broken Roads. I say ‘best bits’, but I should probably say ‘the only bits that I actually enjoyed’, unfortunately.\nBombs wiped out 80% of Australia’s population, and left the remaining nail-hard Nancys and tough Tobiases to fend for themselves in a world short of resources, but shockingly plentiful in both guns and pre-made Vegemite sarnies. You’ll pick one of four character classes - I went with ‘Jackaroo’ (cattle hand), because it was called ‘Jackaroo’ - before tackling a short tutorial section. You'll then be thrust into some events, where you’ll meet the rest of your starting party and kick off the game proper.\n \nRead more",

It really feels like they're keeping a lot of the headline Star Wars stuff at a respectful distance for this one: yes, Jabba the Hutt makes an appearance, but there's nary a whiff of The Force, Jedi or Sith in the trailer and not once does anybody build a Death Star. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Stepping into the be-grimed trainers and unwashed jacket of the protagonist - a misused girl whose vibe is that of a member of Gorillaz - you shoot a single bullet from your gun and control it in first-person as you zip it through the heads, hearts and hands of cultists placed around a level.

I'm glad to hear that they're being tweaked in an upcoming patch, which you can now test in a public beta on Steam, and even the lowest difficulty setting will be tweaked.

          "description": "When Bethesda was working out how to turn their popular Elder Scrolls RPGs into an online behemoth to rival World Of Warcraft back in the late 00s, the initial pitch was \"Elder Scrolls with friends,\" creative director Rich Lambert tells me. A simple idea on paper, perhaps, but one that proved to be a lot more complicated in the realisation of it. Zenimax Online Studios was founded in 2007, a year after The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion landed to universal critical praise, but it wasn't until seven years later that The Elder Scrolls Online finally released for PC in 2014. At launch \"we were walking this weird line between 'online game' and 'Elder Scrolls game',\" Lambert says. \"We didn't do either of them particularly well.\"\nTen years later, though, The Elder Scrolls Online is thriving. At last count, the game has over 24 million players galloping about the plains of Tamriel, and later this June, it will receive its eighth major Chapter expansion, Gold Road, which adds Oblivion's West Weald to the game and wraps up the mystery of the new Daedric Prince that arrived at the end of the previous expansion, Necrom. But the path ESO has taken to get here hasn't been nearly as glittering, with its PC launch in particular generating \"a lot of feedback\", as studio director Matt Firor told press at the game's tenth anniversary event last week. In fact, it wasn't until ESO came to consoles in 2015 that the game really found its voice, says Lambert. \"We had to really figure out what we wanted to be, and we chose 'Elder Scrolls'. As soon as we hit that core pillar of 'It's Elder Scrolls first, online second,' then it really just helped inform everything we've done since.\" Trouble is, when the thrust of ESO's development straddled the launch of two very different Elder Scrolls games, even nailing down that first part of the pillar proved to be more challenging than expected.\nRead more",

It's a puzzle game about growing plants. Holy Strange Horticulture, Batman! But Botany Manor is much less eldritch, and much more gentle historical feel-good movie starring Emma Thompson in the lead role. That role - which in this case is played by you in first person rather than La Thompson - is of Arabella Greene, a retired botanist who, thank God, is the childless inheritor of a huge manor and ancestral wealth, and so is able to spend the sunny days of 1890 pottering around the house and grounds researching weird, slightly fantastical plants almost wholly untroubled. So in this respect it is also a fantasy game. It's quite delightful, which is the sort of phrase I am confident Arabella would use.\nRead more",

          "description": "According to one unofficial tracker created by video game artist Farhan Noor, there have been 8000 layoffs in 2024 so far, following an estimated 10,500 layoffs in 2023. The leaders of Microsoft, Embracer Group, Epic and other industry giants have made swingeing cuts to their workforces. While larger companies have inevitably seen the largest reductions, many smaller developers and publishers have also cut staff or even closed their doors. Circumstances vary by company, of course, but as regards the biggest publishers, there are some broad overlapping causes: reckless or, if you prefer, \"overambitious\" expansion and overhiring during the pandemic lockdown gaming boom; lower-than-hoped returns on new technologies and business models such as NFTs; and rising global interest rates, which have scared away potential investors.\nThe carnage was uppermost in Larian CEO's Swen Vincke's mind when he accepted Baldur's Gate 3's Best Narrative gong at the GDC Awards last month. According to Vincke, the layoffs can be traced straightforwardly to a pattern of executive greed that sees company leadership betting the livelihoods and stability of their workers on whatever new idea seems capable of delivering instant growth for shareholders.\n Read more",

          "description": "Yesterday, if you can believe it, marked the tenth anniversary of The Elder Scrolls Online. That's a whole decade of tromping across Tamriel with your mates, and a whole decade in which I've watched tentatively from the sidelines, thinking about dipping my toes into the MMO pool, but never quite building up the courage (or lining the walls of my bank account) to fully take the plunge. I've heard all the horror stories about starting a new MMO from other members of the RPS Treehouse - particularly when it comes to the lore-laden shackles of World Of Warcraft and the bloated MMO-service-hybrid Destiny - and quite honestly, it's enough to put me off them all entirely. But The Elder Scrolls Online might just be the exception to the rule.\nI spent a portion of the game's tenth birthday yesterday playing Gold Road, its upcoming eighth Chapter expansion. In it, you're whisked over to the West Weald, an autumnal, sun-dappled region whose main city hub, Skingrad, will no doubt feel familiar to seasoned Oblivionites. Seemingly overnight, a strange jungle has sprung up on the city's outskirts, uprooting the nearby villages of the neighbouring high elves and causing havoc as strange beasts pour out of its curling root beds. There are more mysteries to unravel here, too, including the emergence of the new Daedric Prince, Ithelia (revealed at the end of last year's Necrom Chapter), and much more besides - too much to realistically take in during a 90-minute preview session, or for this MMO newbie to fully comprehend the significance of. But there's something about Gold Road and its gnarled-up jungles, strange cults and fantastical beasts that's definitely made me want to make a return journey here when it launches on PC on June 3rd.\nRead more",

Yu Miyake, who has been involved with numerous DQ games since he joined Enix in 1989 as marketer on DQ books, is moving on to head up Square Enix’s mobile games.\nThe change comes as part of shake-ups at Squeenix under new President and blockchain enjoyer Takashi Kiryu, who Bloomberg point out has committed to reverse SE’s flagging sales of both big releases (like Final Fantasy 16) and mobile titles (like Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis), possibly so he can profit handsomely enough to construct himself an arm-mounted Australian Shepherd launcher (like Final Fantasy 8.)\n \nRead more",

You can find Roblox Studios' full response over on Eurogamer.\nOriginal story\nRoblox allows its players to create and monetise their own creations within its ecosystem. Across the entire breadth of Roblox game makers, a lot of money is made. At the individual level, however, the vast majority of creators making work within Roblox never earn enough to cash out their earnings - and some of those creators are children. This has long led to allegations that Roblox is exploiting child labour, generating value for Roblox Studio and its shareholders in the process.\r\n\n\"I don't know, you can say this for a lot of things, right?\" said Roblox Studio head Stefano Corazza at GDC, when the allegation was put to him by Eurogamer. \"Like, you can say, 'Okay, we are exploiting, you know, child labour,' right? Or, you can say: we are offering people anywhere in the world the capability to get a job, and even like an income. So, I can be like 15 years old, in Indonesia, living in a slum, and then now, with just a laptop, I can create something, make money and then sustain my life.\r\n\n \nRead more",

She'll be available to conjure by using slabs at new Summoning Altars. Be prepared for a tough fight, especially if you opt for the \"extreme\" version of the boss. Bellanoir can't be captured, but she does drop a Pal Egg on defeat.\r\n\n\r\nThis is a chunky update, with a bunch of new items and tweaks to the building system, Pal falling damage, shop prices, player drops on multiplayer servers, and the user interface - for example, you'll now see how many of a Pal you own when you aim a Palsphere at one. You can also now cancel a Pal's break simply by picking them up and throwing them at the worksite - truly, a scene from Dickens. All the new stuff is in addition to the usual bugfixes, fresh anti-cheating measures and quashing of exploits: no longer will you be able to massively increase your attack power while riding Pals under certain conditions.\r\n \nRead more",

In the space of a single, rollercoaster paragraph, Betts earned my curiosity by describing himself as a fellow Soul Reaver enthusiast, lost it again by criticising Soul Reaver’s camera - such insolence! - and earned it swiftly back by mentioning that he’s from Yorkshire. Then, he upgraded my curiosity into attention by describing The Horror At Highrook as a “clockwork narrative” horror experience that takes inspiration from Poe, Stoker and Lovecraft on the one hand, and from boardgames, wiki-hunting and escape rooms on the other.\nThis is a heady brew indeed. Also, there appears to be a cat in the game called Mr Tubbs, described as a “portly grey barrel of fur”. I entertain suspicions of Mr Tubbs.

ESO has also swelled and sprouted steadily as a work of geography and history, with major chapters introducing areas hitherto only mentioned in dusty collectible tomes, or creatively reintroducing locations from the single player series – the forthcoming Gold Road expansion, out in June 2024, takes us to the West Weald in Cyrodiil, an area last seen in The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion. \r\n\n \nRead more",

While each Shikai is viable, some are definitely better than others in all forms of gameplay. Those in the S Tier are always going to perform the best in most forms of gameplay. Those in the A Tier are still strong options that will have no problems, while those in the B Tier cater to specific strengths and scenarios. Those in the C Tier should be avoided if possible unless you just really like playing as it. As you may expect, the Legendary Shikai Elements are typically the best.

This Tier List assumes your weapons are M1 stats, just to keep everything fair. Obviously, a weapon with proper stats while one has none is gonna be better regardless. Also, weapons like the Inkblade require the Legendary Ink Element of Shikai, so it is ranked based on its respective Shikai as a whole.

The Factory will be nearby, where you must head toward the front of the vessel. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nUse the stairs and ladders to reach the top of the boat. The main object you're looking for is the helm near the Boat Horn. You'll likely run into some enemies while on your way there, so be on the lookout. Use a team if need be, but it is possible to run it solo with the right weapons. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nInteract with the station at the back of the helm to activate the Boat Horn in Warzone. You should see a \"Horn\" option when approaching it. Once that's done, the Blaze Up notification will appear for the mission's completion. Unfortunately, the horn may attract enemy Operators toward you, as it did for me. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nAfter completing the objective, the Hot Out of the Oven Weapon Sticker should be available. Over time, more rewards can be earned in the MW3 and Warzone Season 3 Blaze Up event, including XP Tokens, High as Duck Charm, and the Bro, You're Out of This World Calling Card.

          "description": "It won't come cheap, but Activision added a new Gold Cheetah weapon camo to Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone.\n\n\nRecently, CoD community members slammed the devs for incentivizing players to purchase four King Kong and Godzilla operator packs for $80 to unlock an exclusive melee weapon. The Beast Glove failed to meet expectations, as it didn't feature any unique animations or allow players to equip a camo on it. Instead of reeling the monetization practices in, Activision one-upped itself and released an even more expensive cosmetic item.\n\n\nHow to get the Gold Cheetah weapon camo in MW3 and Warzone\n\n\nThe Gold Cheetah camo comes at a price. Image via Activision \n\n\nHere is a step-by-step guide on how to unlock the Golden Cheetah camo. \n\n\n\nGo to the Call of Duty Shop website \n\n\nComplete a purchase through the store totaling $100 USD or more to receive a digital code for a Gold Cheetah Weapon Camo \n\n\nAfter receiving the code, log in to your Activision account on the Call of Duty website\n\n\nScroll over to the redeem page\n\n\nType in the code with the correct spelling and capitalization\n\n\nHit “REDEEM CODE” to claim your reward\n\n\n\nThis promotion event runs from April 10-24. Activision clarified that the limit is one code per eligible order and a maximum of five codes per household. Additionally, Codes will be delivered to the email address provided at checkout, and may not be sent immediately. Activision also confirmed that any items purchased as part of the offer cannot be cancelled or returned, and this is only a limited-time offer while supplies last. \n\n\nCommunity members are sure to have conflicting opinions over a cosmetic item costing $100. But based on recent trends, it doesn't look like Activision has any plans to stop pushing the envelope further if players are still willing to make a purchase. \n\nThe post How to get the Gold Cheetah weapon camo in MW3 and Warzone appeared first on Destructoid.",

It doesn’t matter what excuses people give. There are no false permanent bans.” So for players, who may have thought they were banned without reason, Activision pushed back against that notion and defended every ban that is dealt. \n\n\nActivision doubles down on its stance on cheaters. Image via Activision\n\n\nSome community members allegedly used an external unlock tool to get cosmetic items for free that they otherwise had to pay for. CharlieIntel confirmed, \"Using unlock tools in Call of Duty is a bannable offense, and you can get permanently banned for using it. Not sure why some of the people claiming they got banned for using it are acting surprised.\" It's unclear if all of the recent bans stemmed from unlock tools, \n\n\nThis isn't the first time Activision has defended its anti-cheat system. At the end of February, Warzone players feared that RICOCHET stopped working. Activision responded to concerns by clarifying that the cheating service was never offline and actually banned over 6,000 accounts for cheating between February 16-20. The war against cheating is a long and arduous one, but it's clear that the devs have a clear vision and mission when it comes to dealing with hackers. \n\nThe post Activision responds to wave of permanent bans in MW3 and Warzone appeared first on Destructoid.",

Both bullets and blades will fly on May 21, 2024.\n\n\nThis is one that I've been following for years at this point, and I'm not the only one at this site who's been impressed by it in the past. Gestalt does look like a pixel-art action-platformer, which can seem a little routine these days. But the actual play is anything but; it's got a great mix of RPG concepts, interesting narrative hooks and art direction, and some pitch-perfect platforming to tie it all together.\n\n\n\n\nBasically, there's a lot more going on under the hood than a first glance might make you think. The story follows Aletheia, an elite mercenary in a fantasy steampunk world. Picking up quests and taking on the occassional odd-job is all part of her quest to discover what lies beneath all the steam and steel of this world.\n\n\nThe slicing-and-shooting combination feels fantastic though, reminding me of the Mega Man ZX series and other games that combine blaster with blade. I could go on further, but you could also just check it out for yourself. There's a demo available on Steam right now, if you want to check out Gestalt ahead of its launch date.\n\n\nAfter several years, I hope all of Gestalt comes together for a solid side-scrolling experience. Among the many games at the Triple-I Initiative showcase today, it's definitely one I was happy to see reappear. We'll see how the full game lands on May 21.\n\nThe post Action-platformer Gestalt: Steam & Cinder locks in a May launch appeared first on Destructoid.",

There will be 20 new waves in total, complete with new enemies and bosses that aim to up the difficulty for those who have survived everything Brotato has thrown at them thus far.

With this feature being more prevalent in big online games nowadays, does this do the same?\n\n\nHere’s what we know about interactions between the current platforms this game is on below.\n\n\nDoes Helldivers 2 have cross-progression?\n\n\nUnfortunately, Helldivers 2 does not have cross-progression at the time of this being out. The CEO of Arrowhead Game Studios and Creative Director of Helldivers 2, Jonathan Pilestedt, took to X (formerly Twitter) to discuss this matter:\n\n\n\n\nIn the Tweet, he said that this feature would be implemented “sometime in the future”. He further added that he didn’t think there would be enough interest in it, so it was never added. \n\n\nSo, the answer isn’t an outright no, but you shouldn’t hold out on it if you were planning on playing Helldivers 2 between your PC or handheld and the PlayStation 5. Choose your preferred platform and stick to it in the meantime. \n\n\nShould the option become available in the future, you can then support democracy on two different fronts.\n\n\nLuckily, since this game supports cross-play between PlayStation 5 and PC, you aren’t at too much of a loss for not being able to switch platforms and keep your progress. \n\n\nThe only loss would really be for those who have a handheld PC like an ROG Ally or a Steam Deck who want to take the game on-the-go, but primarily play on PlayStation.\n\nThe post Does Helldivers 2 have cross-progression?

Lenovo launched the Legion Go late last year, and we're already getting hints about a next-gen model.\n\n\nAccording to a recent report from Videocardz, Lenovo's Gaming Category Manager Clifford Chong spoke at the Innovate 2024 conference in Bangkok about what happens next. A quote from them says the company sees potential in continuing in the mobile PC market after the release of the Legion Go.\n\n\n\n\nWhile there's still work being done on the current model, Chong says the team is \"looking towards when the time comes right\" regarding the next generation. A potential Legion Go 2 will likely \"provide even more features.\"\n\n\nWhy no Steam Deck 2?\n\n\nIn all of this, it's tempting to get caught up asking what Valve is planning next for the Deck. Released at the start of 2022, the hardware contained within it is already starting to look a little outdated. As a quick comparison, the Legion Go uses the fourth generation AMD Zen and RDNA3 technology, while the Steam Deck has Zen2 and RDNA2. Videocardz suggests a potential Legion Go 2 could sport Zen5 and RDNA3.5 tech.\n\n\nOf course, Valve did release the OLED version of the Deck in November last year. While it did boast a few improvements, such as better battery life, its focus was mainly on providing a better screen. The main guts of the device remained largely untouched.\n\n\nThat's not to say something isn't being planned, but with Lenovo already looking ahead to possible newer models, it feels like Valve may  need to make an announcement about something soon.\n\nThe post Lenovo is already planning a next-gen Legion Go appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "World of Warcraft, Overwatch, Hearthstone, and more are coming back to China thanks to a new deal with Microsoft and NetEase. Blizzard announced today that an agreement was reached to reinstate all of their games that were shut down in January of last year.\n\n\nIt was a rather messy breakup when Blizzard had to pull away from China. It's hard to know exactly what happened, as both sides of the relationship blamed the other. But ultimately, NetEase and Blizzard were unable to come to terms that satisfied both parties.\n\n\nIt's important to note that in China, outside companies need to have a sort of sponsor company from within the country in order to operate. Together, the two companies then create a separate Chinese version of the company that technically operates on its own. That's the most basic way to describe what is otherwise a very complicated process for outside companies. \n\n\n\n\nThe big question I have is what happens next for Chinese players. It was no doubt a gut-wrenching day for players to lose all of their time spent in WoW and Hearthstone. I know that Blizzard typically saves account data on their side, including characters and card collections. Hopefully players won't have to start over from scratch when Blizzard games show back up.\n\n\nAlong with all of this, Microsoft announced that they're working to bring more NetEase titles to Xbox consoles and other platforms.\n\nThe post Microsoft teams with NetEase to bring Blizzard games back to China appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Most Call of Duty eliminations unleash bloody messes with the countless sweet takedowns of opponents. However, some challenges forbid you from getting your hands dirty, specifically with the MW3 Clean Kill objective. It's a feat that doesn't necessarily have a description, so we're here to explain it in detail. \n\n\nMW3 Clean Kills, explained\n\n\nMW3's  Clean Kills are eliminations where you don't take any damage from the target or other Operators. So, while you're busy eliminating an enemy, make sure not to get hit by anyone else on the opposing side. This includes explosions, bullets, or any melee attacks. Unfortunately, the game won't instantly notify you when a Clean Kill is initiated, so check the progress on the challenge to see if it worked:\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nAs an avid Call of Duty player, I know how hard Clean Kills can be since shooting often puts a target on your back. One way I've found helpful is using Killstreaks and gear to mark the opposing sides' positions. That way, it'll reduce the risk of a surprise attack. UAV and Advanced UAV Killstreaks are excellent tools to use, as is the CCT Comms Vest (which shows any nearby enemy locations upon a kill).\n\n\nLong-distance attacks probably work best for the Clean Kills in MW3, given that opponents are less likely to hit you. I suggest avoiding the more compact-sized maps like Stash House and Growhouse. It's almost impossible not to get hit in smaller locations, so try out medium areas such as Highrise, 6 Star, and Greece. \n\n\nMany challenges utilize Clean Kills to earn exclusive rewards. For example, MW3 weekly and camo challenges frequently require this elimination. So, stay alive while shooting the enemy to get those valuables in no time. \n\nThe post What is a Clean Kill in MW3? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Rocket League has gone a long way since 2015, starting only on the PS4 and Steam. Since then, it has expanded so much, eventually becoming a free-to-play game with many wondering: does Rocket League support cross-platform play? \n\n\nWe’ll break down everything you need to know below.\n\n\nIs Rocket League Cross Platform?\n\n\nIn short, yes, Rocket League is a cross-platform game. It’s also quite simple to partake in this so there won’t be any barriers to playing online. \n\n\nWith cross-platform enabled, you will be able to add friends who are on other platforms and play with them in private or public lobbies. On top of that, matchmaking times will be significantly shorter because you’re in a larger pool of players.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHow to turn cross-platform on in Rocket League\n\n\nCross-play will be enabled once you get through the log-in process in Rocket League. You literally can not play the game without an Epic Games account. So, upon logging in or creating an EG account, you’ll be able to get into crossplay action in no time.\n\n\nThe feature should already be on by default once you’re in the main menu either going through customizations or setting up a match.\n\n\nYou also do not need to link your primary account to Epic Games if you have multiple platforms. Just as long as you have a login with Epic Games, you’re good to go. If you want to carry your progress from one platform to another, that’s when you will need to link accounts.\n\n\nAll playable platforms on Rocket League\n\n\nIf you’re looking to see what other platforms Rocket League is on, it’s on the following systems:\n\n\n\nPC (Epic Games)\n\n\nNintendo Switch\n\n\nPlayStation 4 and 5\n\n\nXbox One and Series consoles\n\n\n\nThe same login process will be needed if you play between platforms, though once you have your account linked, everything should carry over minus platform-exclusive items, some licensed content, and currency.\n\nThe post Is Rocket League Cross Platform?

We're here to show you how to get this exclusive bundle in MW3 and Warzone. \n\n\nHow do you get the Cheech and Chong bundle in MW3 and Warzone?\n\n\nIf you've recently logged into Modern Warfare 3 or Warzone, you may have noticed an option to get the Cheech and Chong Tracer Pack. However, the new bundle has since been removed, as it was initially intended to launch in the Store on April 20, 2024. This was due to the release of the Blaze Up event, which allowed players to access the bundle early.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nFrom what we can tell from this brief interval, you can purchase the Cheech and Chong Tracer Pack for 3,000 CP. The bundle comes with the following content:\n\n\n\nStill Smokin' Tracers\n\n\n \"Up In Smoke\" Death Effect: The \"Dankest\" MTZ-556 Assault Rifle\n\n\n \"Hashassin\" HRM-9 SMG\n\n\n \"Mellow and Mild\" Haymaker Shotgun\n\n\n \"Secondhand Smoke\" Finishing Move\n\n\n \"Be Mellow\" Large Decal\n\n\n \"Cheech & Chong's\" Large Decal\n\n\n \"Smoke Buds\" Weapon Sticker\n\n\n \"Iconic\" Weapon Charm\n\n\n \"Cheech and Chong's Seltzer\" Weapon Charm\n\n\n \"Blunt Buddies\" Loading Screen\n\n\n\nSince the Cheech and Chong pack has already debuted for a limited time, you may see other Operators smoking out the competition with the new content. Unfortunately, it won't be accessible until it is officially released on MW3 and Warzone. \n\n\nOn the other hand, the Blaze Up event will take you high above the clouds with the exclusive Stoney Sloth Tracer Pack. Sure, it's not Cheech and Chong, but at least it gives you an early start for your chill session.

Featuring a unique stylized art style, The Rogue Prince of Persia returns the franchise to its 2D action-platforming roots with a dash of roguelite gameplay. It's set to enter Early Access on Steam on May 14.\n\n\n\n\nSeveral rumors popped up around the internet this last week about a Prince of Persia game being developed by Evil Empire, best known for its popular roguelike metroidvania title Dead Cells. Now we not only know it's real and titled The Rogue Prince of Persia, but we'll be able to get our hands on it very soon as it enters its Early Access phase in just over a month.\n\n\nThe Rogue Prince of Persia takes place in a fictional rendition of Ctesiphon, the capital of the Persian Empire. The city is under invasion by the Hun's army of possessed soldiers, and players must embody the Prince who is gifted with a mystical bola that resurrects him when he dies.\n\n\nIn classic Prince of Persia fashion, players will explore a plethora of biomes as they unlock new weapons, trinkets, and gear upgrades while trying to save the city from destruction.\n\n\nIt's a great time to be a Prince of Persia fan. Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown was great, so getting another authentic PoP platformer just months later feels like we're being a bit spoiled.\n\n\nThe Rogue Prince of Persia enters Early Access on Steam on May 14, and will release on other platforms at a later date.\n\nThe post The Rogue Prince of Persia is real and coming to Early Access next month appeared first on Destructoid.",

That includes using the controller's haptic feedback to \"sense the movements of the deep sea.\" The adaptive triggers add a kick to firing Dave's speargun and a vibrating tension to the harpoon gun. Sound effects, such as phone call ringtones, are emitted through the controller speaker. \n\n\nDave the Diver stars the titular diver as he explores undersea environments to locate and capture various marine species. After fishing, players then use these ingredients to operate a growing sushi restaurant.\nAs editor-in-chief Matt Miller wrote in his 8.75 out of 10 review, \"You might question whether a sushi restaurant management sim crossed with underwater diving is your cup of tea, but that would be missing the point.

I am, however, a fan of the Fallout show’s creators, Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy. The two worked together on Westworld and though my fandom faded over time, I will always hold up the first season as some of my favorite television ever. I went into Amazon’s Fallout adaptation with unsure expectations. Video game movies and TV shows have improved in recent years, but I will always be hesitant. And time has frequently proven that one successful project from a creator (or a pair in this case) does not automatically equal success in another.

As pointed out on X (formerly Twitter) by Genki_JPN, Utada's new Science Fiction album, which they released yesterday, features a re-recording of \"Hikari,\" the Japanese version of \"Simple and Clean.\" \nIf you're a Kingdom Hearts fan, you likely already know which song this is. However, if you haven't touched the series in a while, or if you've never played the beginning of Kingdom Hearts, it's the Japanese version of the song in this famous game opener below: \n\n\nAs for the new recording of \"Hikari,\" its place on Science Fiction makes sense because its Utada's first greatest hits album, if you will, meant to act as a compilation with new mixes of old songs, re-recordings of fan-favorite tracks, and more. You can listen to the album, which features 26 tracks, starting today. \nIf you're interested in hearing the new recording of \"Hikari,\" you can listen below: \n\n\nFor more about Kingdom Hearts, watch the Kingdom Hearts IV trailer here, and then check out Game Informer's Kingdom Hearts III review.

          "description": "Amazon Studios' Fallout TV series will premiere one day early, with all eight episodes now hitting Prime Video on April 10 at 6 p.m. PT/9 p.m. ET. The series was originally due out on April 12 but Amazon announced it had moved the launch day up to April 11 alongside a new look at the show. Now, Amazon has moved the date up one more day, meaning you can check out this live-action adaptation of the post-apocalyptic wasteland tomorrow. \nWalton Goggins, who plays The Ghoul, announced this news during a new Fallout commercial that aired last night (April 8) during the NCAA Men's Basketball Championship Game. After the first episode airs at 6 p.m. PT/9 p.m. ET tomorrow, the other seven episodes will be available for viewing exclusively on Prime Video in more than 240 countries and territories worldwide. \nIf you haven't yet seen it, check out the latest Fallout trailer for a new look at the show: \n\n\n\"Based on one of the greatest video game series of all time, Fallout is the story of haves and have-nots in a world in which there's almost nothing left to have,\" a press release reads. \"Two hundred years after the apocalypse, the gentle denizens of luxury fallout shelters are forced to return to the irradiated hellscape their ancestors left behind – and are shocked to discover an incredibly complex, gleefully weird, and highly violent universe waiting for them.\" \nAmazon Studios, which is behind series like The Boys and Invincible, is producing Fallout alongside Kilter Films and executive producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy. Nolan directed the first three episodes of Fallout. \nFallout premieres on Prime Video on April 10. \nFor more, check out the teaser trailer for Fallout released back in December.

We learn about his childhood fascination with becoming a manga artist, the transition from college life to working at Sega, and his early career developing games like Devi and Pii, Golden Axe 3, and Sonic the Hedgehog 3. Iizuka remembers the excitement and challenge during the transition from the Sega Genesis (known as the Sega Mega Drive in Japan) to the Sega Saturn, which allowed the team progress from 2D pixel art to 3D polygonal modeling.\nNotably, the Sonic the Hedgehog lead reflects on the early Dreamcast days, moving to the United States to better implement western culture into Sonic Adventure 2, and finally, describes his emotions after hearing Sega was exiting the hardware business and ending production of the Dreamcast. \nSonic the Hedgehog Lead Reflects on SEGA's Road to Dreamcast:\n\n\nPlease subscribe to Game Informer's YouTube channel if you enjoy this video.

However, it looks like a second season is already in the works. \nVariety reports (thanks, Eurogamer) that The California Film Commission has awarded $152 million in tax incentives to a dozen TV shows across various studios to lure production of those series into the state. $25 million of these tax credits has been allocated to Fallout's second season, so production is now expected to take place in California. Fallout’s $153 million budget is the largest of any show on this list\nSeason 1 was largely filmed in New York, with some production in Utah. However, as Variety notes, receiving this tax credit does not guarantee Amazon will accept it and relocate Fallout's production to California for Season 2.\n\n\nFallout premieres on Amazon Prime Video on Thursday, April 11. The eight-episode series is directed by Westworld showrunners Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, with Bethesda head Todd Howard serving as executive producer. The cast includes Ella Purnell, Walton Goggins, Kyle MacLachlan, and Aaron Moten. The show’s synopsis reads\n[Source: Variety]\nWill you be checking out Fallout this week?

          "description": "Stellar Blade director Kim Hyung Tae has announced that developer ShiftUp's upcoming action game, Stellar Blade, will get a New Game+ mode sometime after launch. Plus, Tae says there will be no microtransactions in the game, save for one theoretical exception. \nThis news comes from a new interview with Korean publication Ruliweb, where Tae explained that while Stellar Blade will have a New Game+ mode at some point, it won't be available at launch, as translated by Genki_JPN on Twitter. Tae also told Ruliweb that players should not expect any microtransactions in Stellar Blade, but notes that one exception would be paid collaborations with another company's IP. \n\n\n\"We want to make it clear at this point that Stellar Blade will not require any additional expenses that gamers are not aware of beyond what they paid for the package,\" Tae told Ruliweb. \"The only exception is if we create collaboration costumes with another company's IP; those may be sold for a fee. Also, there is no New Game+ in the launch version, so please look forward to it being updated very soon.\" \nGiven that no collaborations have been announced at this point, Tae is likely just checking bases for hypothetical collaborations ShiftUp may or may not be pursuing. At any rate, given the popularity of ShiftUp's Goddess of Victory: NIKKE game on mobile devices, it's possible we see an internal collaboration between those two properties. \nStellar Blade is an action game launching on PlayStation 5 exclusively on April 26. It was announced in 2021 as Project EVE. There is a demo for Stellar Blade available on PSN that you can download right now if you're curious about how the game plays. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Stellar Blade feature for behind-the-scenes details and new insight from Tae. \n[Source: Ruliweb]\nAre you excited for Stellar Blade?

It's also how we learned the game will run at 30 FPS on Xbox Series X/S. \nSpeaking to German publication GamePro, Hellblade II visual effects director Mark Slater-Tunstill confirmed the game will run at 30 FPS alongside dynamic scaling on Xbox Series X/S, as reported by Wccftech. Slater-Tunstill told GamePro the 30 FPS makes sense with the game's more cinematic nature. However, if you're after higher frames, a beefier PC can likely accomplish that. \n\n\nRegardless of frames, Hellblade II is sure to be stunning visually. Developed in Epic Games' Unreal Engine 5, Ninja Theory told Polygon this engine has allowed the game's more realistic nature to be achievable, thanks to its Nanite geometry system and because \"the turnaround between scanning the thing and putting it in the level is drastically cut, and you can spend that time finessing.\" Be sure to read Polygon's full Hellblade II preview for more details on what to expect visually from this game. \nHellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 21. \nFor more, watch the latest Hellblade II trailer here, and then read about Hellblade II's photo mode and what to expect from it at launch.

Speaking with the developer over e-mail, the team says, \"We have been able to double the frame rate to 60 fps, added anti-aliasing, and implemented higher resolution settings so that players can take advantage of the power of a high-end PC.\" The game's layout has also been adjusted for the PC version.\nStar Wars: Galaxy of Heroes originally launched for mobile devices back in 2015, and has amassed a following over the years. In that time, players have figured out ways to emulate the game on PC, but this will be an official release. Along with improved visuals, the game will also support mouse and keyboard as well as keybinds (unfortunately \"there is no controller support at this time\"). Longtime players will also be able to bring all their progress over by linking their mobile account to their EA account when playing on PC for the first time, and all future updates will release on both mobile and PC platforms simultaneously. The teams says, \"The PC and mobile version will always be in lockstep and release updates at the same time.\"\nBeta access for the PC version will be available for current mobile players in May before expanding to a larger audience. From the developer: \"For those interested, they can head to the Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes website, sign up for the EA App, link their account, and they are now ready to register. There’s a dedicated registration page that can be found on the website the day registration begins! For those selected, you will be receiving an invite via email for access to the Closed Beta.\" You can learn more here.",

Knowing of the Ardognus prophecy, created by the powerful high priest Hahmid III, you must find and destroy the hidden shrine devoted to Ra before the eclipse occurs.\nEmbark on this exciting journey packed with a trusty gun for blasting through doors or dispatching undead mummies; a compass to guide you through a treacherous pyramid; a wristwatch to track the precious time left; and a water bottle to fight dehydration (you’re only human after all). \nCan you solve this ancient mystery within 120 minutes and avert catastrophe, or will Rah's wrath obliterate the moon?\nOur modern reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Total Eclipse support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC. More releases are coming at a later date. Additionally, there are three playable demos if you want to test the game. Please contact us if you have some other release or demo.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build.
