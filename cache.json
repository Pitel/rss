The first two GameCube titles knocked it out of the park, providing a plethora of content from the addictive maze-like main stages to the incredible minigames. Since then, however, the series has seemingly been unable to reach the same heights, either content to take one step forward and two steps back, or otherwise completely fumbling the (monkey) ball altogether.\nAfter Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania instilled a smidgen of confidence with its commendable restoration of Super Monkey Ball 1 and 2, Sega is back with a brand-new entry in the form of Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble. However, in keeping with franchise tradition, it’s yet another game that just can’t quite hit the home run, combining a solid single-player experience with a bunch of multiplayer modes that, frankly, aren’t worth the price of admission or the time investment.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Grezzo's 2019 Switch release The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening requires close to the same amount of space.

          "description": "Update: Whelp, spoke too soon. Apparently some Steam Deck players are seeing an \"Innapropriate activity detected\" message upon launching Elden Ring, blocking them from playing online. I haven't had this myself, and some have reported the issue fixing itself after they installed the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, but hopefully there's a proper patch in the works.\nElden Ring on the Steam Deck has long enjoyed a smoothness that desktop play has lacked. Not so much in simple framerate terms – the handheld spends far more time around the 30fps mark than it does bumping into Elden Ring’s 60fps cap – but thanks to a Proton compatibility update back in 2022, it’s drastically less prone to the flow-breaking stutter that still plagues the RPG in 2024. That now goes for Shadow Of The Erdtree as well, judging from my portable time in the new expansion.\nRead more",

          "description": "A phoenix is a mythological firebird that is periodically reborn from its own ashes, a symbol of cyclical renewal. It's also, according to several former employees of Chorus developers Fishlabs in Hamburg, an internal title for the massive cost-cutting project begun by Swedish conglomerate Embracer Group in June 2023.\nThe current incarnation of a bewildering series of mergers, renamings and acquisitions that date back to the founding of Nordic Games in 2004, Embracer have spent much of the past decade buying up video game studios and licenses, from Deus Ex developers Eidos Montreal to the adaptation rights for The Lords Of The Rings. According to a February 2023 earnings report, by the end of December 2022 the conglomerate had 134 internal studios on the books (including table-top developers) and owned or controlled over 850 IPs, with 224 games in development. Our Graham warned of the perils of such consolidation in 2019, and his misgivings have been borne out. Following the reported collapse of a billion dollar Savvy Games investment deal, Embracer set out to recover their debts by cancelling projects, laying off staff and closing whole studios. Fishlabs - acquired by Embracer in 2018 alongside their parent company Koch Media, nowadays Plaion - were among those burned by \"Project Phoenix\", first losing a dozen people in September 2023, and then around half their remaining workforce in November. In the process of these reductions, Embracer also binned off two video game projects – a sumptuous sci-fi metroidvania that was in full development, and a \"visual prototype\" for a brand new Red Faction game.\n  \nRead more",

Early footage painted the portrait of a spirited 3D hack-and-slasher featuring much buckling of swashes, heaving of hos and jollying of rogers.\nJim Rossignol (RPS in peace) was cautiously enthused when he played Captain Blood in 2008. \"It was actually pretty fun - especially the arcade boat violence between speedy galleons - but I'm not exactly holding out for a masterpiece,\" he wrote. Alas, Captain Blood's ship struck a reef in the shape of unspecified publishing disputes, and sank beneath the waves after one last defiant preview showing in 2010. Now, the game has risen from the depths Flying Dutchman-style thanks to new developers Seawolf Studio and General Arcade and publisher SNEG Ltd.

And every \"yersel\" sneering out of the machismo-ridden workers became \"yourself\". Well, turns out that's the result of the game defaulting to \"International English\" for its captions.

Let’s start by addressing that last complaint: the units of Battle Aces have immense personality. It just doesn’t come across well in screens.\nEach is a mix of bug and robot, with a clutch of finely observed, quirky-but-never-gratuitous animations that immediately had me choosing favourites when I played the game at Summer Game Fest. \"Our main unit design concept artist, his father was also an illustrator and nature illustrator at that, so he's already accomplished with animal designs, but he also loves mechs and robots too,\" notes Uncapped Games art director Ted Park. \"So he's kind of melded both worlds as much as he can.\"\r\n \nRead more",

The Land Of Shadow may not be as expansive as the base game's Lands Between, but it's knottier, denser, more of a twisting mass that burrows into the earth and soars into the skies. For this reason I think it produces some of Elden Ring's finest moments, as exploration leads to a truer sense of discovery reminiscent of old Souls. But I also think its sheer density exposes more chinks in its open world format, where its interconnected sprawl leads to even greater recollection paralysis.\nRead more",

The truth is the pixellated hangout zone of the early 2000s never went away. It has been alive this whole time. You forgot about the Hotel.

I'd save up to buy one of the premium headliners, attempt to get my money's worth inside a week, then swap it for a respected double-A and perhaps a sub-£8 oddity with the manual missing - nesting one purchase within the other like a series of Matryoshka dolls.\nThis was my Big Short, my Moneyball. But it had a drawback: often, I was so eager to leapfrog to another game before the trade-in price changed that I skimmed RPGs that are now considered classics. The big one was Suikoden 2, which I spent only an evening with before gambling that I'd eke more FunValue out of a game with a less traditional battle system. I can't remember what I traded that for, which says it all. Another was Baten Kaitos on Gamecube, which - yes, we are finally getting to the point here - has just been rereleased on Steam in the shape of a Baten Kaitos I & II HD Remaster. I can't remember what I traded Baten Kaitos for either, which again, says it all. Please, gentle reader - be better.\r\n \nRead more",

I'm not entirely convinced it has longevity beyond its impeccably scorched and dented PS1 vibes, but I definitely think you should try the demo, now that the early access version is out.\n Read more",

Leaky ceilings, busted panelling, faulty drill machinery - the omens pile up as you spend your first thirty minutes wandering through the colleague-packed canteen and over the platform into the boss' office for a severe dressing-down. It's a classic pre-disaster setup for a mostly traditional monster story, yet the game sticks expertly to the first-person horror form, and its voice actors' performances are so spot-on, that it'd feel churlish to judge this foaming fear simulator for sticking to type. It also has some markedly unsettling use of the shipping forecast, a famously dull feature of British radio I definitely did not expect to freak me out in a video game.\nRead more",

It's another indication that this will be more biffy action game than thinky party-based RPG. The upside, assuming you find that last sentence disappointing, is that exploration and combat will be more \"intimate\", and individual characters will have more screentime to bounce off each other and flourish as personalities.

It seems mad to think of Kanitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess this way, given that on some level, it is a tower defence game. Tower defence! The archetypal browser-based strategy experience and darling of emerging smartphones. The great-uncle once-removed of today's idle clickers. Without meaning any disrespect to those currently working in the genre, which I've had a tonne of fun with, when's the last time you were seriously excited by tower defence? As of this week, I am seriously excited by tower defence, because Path Of The Goddess has captured my imagination. It's a stately, beautiful thing. I had a go at this year's Keighleycon, and it's one of two games at the show I wanted to carry on playing once my time was up.

I must now hang my head and await the executioner's ludicrously oversized hammer, for while Phantom Blade Zero's ambience and layouts owe something to From's work, the moment-to-moment has just as much in common with older hack-and-slash games such as Ninja Gaiden. I played a bit of it at Summer Game Fest this week, and while I’m not rushing out to preorder (I never am, in fairness), I think it could be a good ‘un.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Ten years ago, we were drowning in early access survival games about chopping trees and crafting camp fires. Rust pit monstrous players against one another, DayZ had us dashing around for beans and bleach, while The Forest creeped us the hell out in a dark jungle. There was even a week-long celebration here at RPS called survival week to get the genre out of our systems. A lot of those games have since graduated to a full 1.0 release, but one survivalist shambled on. 7 Days To Die is a solid sandbox craft 'em up with zombie hordes, and it never left the comfort of its early access log cabin surrounded by spikes and land mines. But a (tentative) release date is finally on the horizon, according to the developers. And it's quite soon.\nRead more",

The demo in question was for Monster Hunter Wilds, which they probably should rename Monster Hadron Collider in that a major selling point appears to be making the megafauna converge and murder each other. It's possible to do this in previous games, especially 2018's Monster Hunter: World, but not like this. Not like this. Alas for the Alpha Doshaguma.

If you want to buff your Holy damage with the added bonus of shooting more lasers than a novelty lamp from Spencer's, you'll just need to complete two simple steps.\n\n\nFirst, get the Stone-Sheathed Sword\n\n\nFirst thing's first, we'll need an unassuming looking stone sword found in the Ruins of Rauh. It's only obtainable after you unclog the area's Spirit Spring, shortly after the section of Scarlet Rot and red Pest enemies. Once you've got the Spirit Spring flowing, make your way to the following location on the map to find an invisible bridge. Cross it, and take the sword from the altar.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, head to Unte Ruins\n\n\nIf you haven't found or unlocked the Unte Ruins, don't fret. We have a handy guide for both finding and unlocking them. Basically, you'll just be taking a somewhat hidden ladder in Shadow Keep, then heading through an illusory wall to get to the ruins. Then it's just a quick toss of a Hefty Furnace Pot into the slumbering Golem's head to make your way inside.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you've gained access to the ruins, you'll be able to place the Stone-Sheathed Sword in the alter (much like the one you pulled it from) to transform it into the Sword of Light. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\nThe Weapon Art, simply called Light, boosts Holy Damage for about a minute on activation. This buff also applies after the sword has been sheathed, so keeping it handy in an offhand slot could be useful for maximizing the damage of your Incantations.\n\nThe post How to get the Sword of Light in Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Fortnite, the popular battle royale game, is seemingly set to introduce another Marvel superhero skin soon. A reliable Fortnite leaker, @ShiinaBR on Twitter, has revealed that Epic Games is looking to bring the ‘Weapon X’ skin to Fortnite. \n\n\nThe skin will have five items as part of the cosmetic bundle and is based on a character from Marvel's X-Men series. Shiina claims that the skin will arrive in Fortnite on July 5, but its shop section is “still unfinished” at the moment.\n\n\n\n\nFor those unfamiliar, Weapon X was the codename for the Wolverine after he underwent a series of twisted experiments to create the perfect weapon. The leaked Fortnite skin carries the look inspired by the comics and the X-Men '97 animated series, with Wolverine wearing a metal helmet that is used to control him. Those who have seen the X-Men Apocalypse movie would also be able to recognise the skin, as the movie featured a cameo from Hugh Jackman donning the Weapon X look.\n\n\nSince we’re on the subject, it is more than plausible that the Wolverine skin is coming in to continue the hype, not just for the revived X-Men '97 animated series but also for the Deadpool and Wolverine movie, which is slated for a release next month on July 26.\n\n\nFortnite has long been the home for crossovers in gaming, with collaborations across pop culture with artists, movie characters, and more. There have been a handful of Marvel characters who have made their way to the game, some even as playable characters. Iron Man, Doctor Strange, Thanos, Loki, Captain America, Spider-Man, and Thor are just some of the many who have been added to Fortnite at some point. Most recently, Hulk and Hela were added in Chapter 5 Season 2 in April 2024, and interestingly, it was their look from Thor: Ragnarok, the MCU movie that came out in 2017.\n\nThe post Fortnite leak suggests Weapon X skin from X-Men is coming appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It’s not often that a real-life place I’m familiar with gets turned into a staple from Final Fantasy XIV, but today is apparently an exception to this, with London King’s Cross train station getting its very own Aetheryte. \n\n\nThe sculpture has appeared ahead of the FFXIV London Fan Meet on June 24, where players can come together and share stories, memories, and potentially even meet some of their Eorzean friends in real life. \n\n\n\n\nWhen announced on June 17, the available 150 tickets to the London Fan Meet sold out in under an hour. Those who were lucky enough to get tickets, as well as those who weren’t, have been heading into London King’s Cross to attune to this real-life Aetheryte. \n\n\nIt must be nice for those traveling down to London to be met with something familiar from Final Fantasy XIV. Honestly, I’m a little bit tempted to head down to London myself, as this sculpture will only be in its spot today. While the sculpture is definitely not life-sized, it’s still nice to see something from a game that I love so openly placed in the real world.\n\n\nHowever, the London Fan Meet has begun ripples of a discussion among players about the lack of notice provided. The meet was announced at 11 a.m. on a Monday morning, when the majority of FFXIV players would be at work. Even if they did manage to see the Tweet, it’s unlikely that they could get time off work with only a few days' notice. \n\n\nThe Aetheryte in the area outside King’s Cross is another example of this. There are a huge number of British players who I’m sure would have loved the chance to see it, but it will be gone after today. \n\n\nRegardless, this is still a pretty cool thing to know is happening, even if I can’t attend myself. And I’m sure there are a lot of confused Londoners wondering why people are trying to touch the strange blue rock, which is certainly an amusing thought.\n\nThe post London King’s Cross gets its own FFXIV Aetheryte ahead of fan meet-up and Dawntrail appeared first on Destructoid.",

Players will be now able to form 4-person squads in the Apex Games until the end of Season 21.\n\n\nDeveloper Respawn Entertainment has said that the loot pool has been updated too, with more ammo, attachments, and health items spread over the map to bring down the chaos of fighting for resources. While Tridents will only carry three people, Valkyrie’s Ultimate ability will be able to carry four teammates at the same time.\n\n\n\n\nRanked Rumble\n\n\nApex Legends will also be introducing Ranked Rumble, a new game mode, at the end of the Ranked season. Kicking off on August 3, the Ranked Rumble will introduce leaderboards based on Rank Tier, for players to compete in and climb.\n\n\nThere will be 10 Ranked Rumble Matches that players can engage in, and finishing at the top of the leaderboard can earn you unique badges. All players who have earned a Rank this season are automatically eligible for Ranked Rumble, which will end on August 6, and the Ranked season ends with it.\n\n\nWhile the season ends with Ranked Rumble, the placement on the leaderboard will not impact a player’s Ranked Points, Ranked Season placement or rewards which will be locked in once Ranked Rumble commences.\n\n\nCollection event items\n\n\nAs is tradition, a new event brings with it new limited-time cosmetics for players to earn or purchase, as 24 new items will be available during the event. There will be Legendary skins for Octane, Crypto, Fuse, Conduit, Revenant, and Alter. Lifeline gets special treatment for this event, with a Prestige Skin and a new finisher for players to unlock after collecting all 24 items.\n\n\nVideo via Electronic Arts\n\n\nThe update for Apex Legends goes live on June 25.\n\nThe post Apex Legends Double Take event adds Quads, Ranked Rumble, and new Lifeline prestige skin appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "BitLife weekly challenges often ask you to be born in a specific country or region. While some have countries like Japan, Ireland, or Romania, most take place in the United States, with Arizona being one of many options during challenges like Love is Love. \n\n\nHow to live in Arizona in BitLife\n\n\nBeing born in Arizona requires choosing the United States as your starting country and either Tucson or Phoenix as your starting place. Your best bet is to choose Phoenix, as this typically works for any challenge asking you to be born in Arizona. However, if it doesn't for some reason, you have Tucson as a backup plan.\n\n\nYou can use similar strategies to be born in other US states in BitLife, too. For example, if a challenge asks to be born in Alaska, you'll have to choose Anchorage as your starting place. Likewise, if you encounter Tennessee, California, or New Jersey, you'll pick places like Nashville, Los Angeles, or Newark. BitLife uses real-world locations for these challenges, so a quick search on what cities are in a specific US state can help you knock out these objectives easily.\n\n\nWhen you begin a new BitLife challenge, check your character's starting gender or stats. Sometimes, you'll have to begin as a male or female or have a certain percentage value in looks or smarts. Many challenges avoid these requirements altogether, but it's good to watch for this, just in case. \n\n\nAnother important part to check is a challenge's other tasks. For example, having a criminal special talent will make things easier if it's crime-centered. Similarly, if you have to become a famous musician, selecting a musical special talent helps you raise singing or instrument mastery faster. You're usually not required to pick a talent for your character, but they'll help you complete BitLife challenges quickly.\n\nThe post How to be born in Arizona in BitLife appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "As you make your way through Destiny 2's Pale Heart, you'll come across plenty of new items that you can use in different areas of the game. You'll of course receive some of the Pale Heart weapons, including the very powerful Call sidearm, but other items you receive are a little more confusing. Here's what to do with the Luminescent Seeds you acquire in Destiny 2.\n\n\nWhere to use Luminescent Seeds in Destiny 2\n\n\nImage via Destructoid.\n\n\nLuminescent Seeds are a new resource acquired from Overthrow activities, found in the three sections of the Pale Heart. Upon completing activities and increasing the Overthrow to Level 4, then defeating the boss, you'll receive a Luminescent Seed. With this Luminescent Seed, you want to find a Witness hand somewhere within the Pale Heart. It'll look like a black hand holding its palm out, similar to the image at the top of this page but without the blue flowers. Plant the Luminescent Seed there, and you'll be able to return to the hand to gain the Traveler's Blessing buff.\n\n\nImage via Destructoid.\n\n\nAs for what buff you'll receive, that will heavily depend on your drops. Completing certain encounters within the Pale Heart will grant you a Pale Blessings Destination Mod. These can be equipped by opening up the Destination Map using your ghost, then navigating to the Pathfinder icon near the top of the map and selecting the Traveler's Blessings menu. By selecting one of the mods, you'll activate that buff until the next weekly reset every Tuesday. \n\n\nReceiving these buffs requires interacting with a Witness hand that has those flowers, and will grant you 5 minutes of the buff. For example, I had the Pale Blessings mod active that increases grenade energy, and upon interacting with one of the hands, I got 5 minutes of increased grenade energy regen in the Pale Heart.\n\nThe post What to do with Luminescent Seeds in Destiny 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The latest release, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, has attracted attention and, in some sectors of the fan base, controversy for how punishingly difficult it is. The week before the expansion's release, we sat down with From Software president Hidetaka Miyazaki to talk about the notion of difficulty and how the passionate fan base has surprised him over the years.\nThe Soulslike genre, particularly From Software games, puts an emphasis on death as part of the gameplay experience.

To access it, go to \"Settings\" on your PS4 version of Minecraft while playing on a PS5 and select \"Preview.\" This preview includes the new Tricky Trials update, so you can venture into the trial chambers, meet a breeze, craft a mace, and more. \nMojang asks that players who encounter bugs during this preview report it to the developer, and more generally, provide any feedback they might have. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Minecraft review, and then check out this story about how actor Jack Black has all but confirmed he's playing Steve in the upcoming live-action Minecraft movie.

With Rod Humble, a lead designer on The Sims 2 and The Sims 3, leading Tectonic, fans were hopeful about Life By You, which was set to launch into Early Access earlier this month before an indefinite delay.\nThat Early Access launch never happened as Life By You was subsequently canceled, and now, in the same week, Paradox Interactive has announced it is closing Tectonic, as reported by Game Developer. \n\"This is difficult and drastic news for our colleagues at Tectonic, who've worked hard on Life By You's Early Access release,\" Paradox Interactive CEO Fredrik Wester writes in a press release. \"Sadly, with the cancelation of their sole proje…",

In the past, Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka told me Shadow is his favorite character in the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise outside of Sonic. It makes sense; after all, as the director of Sonic Adventure 2, where Shadow made his debut, Iizuka was instrumental in creating the dark hedgehog. \n\"Even now, if you ask me who my favorite character is, Shadow is going to pop up there,\" Iizuka says. \"Even when we think about the foundation of the entire franchise, Sonic and Shadow are really holding up so much of the franchise.

Though other characters appeared in Sonic Generations, Sonic – in both his Classic and Modern forms – was the sole playable character. Now, 13 years later, the well-liked celebratory release returns as the latest Sonic remaster, but it's not simply the same package with performance enhancements. Sure, those are there, but perhaps the biggest selling point is the inclusion of Shadow the Hedgehog as a playable character. \nBut Shadow is much more than a reskin of Sonic.

From Dragon Age: Origins' real-time strategy RPG approach to Dragon Age II's mostly-set-within-one-city action experience to Dragon Age: Inquisition's strategy-action mix, BioWare hasn't quite defined the franchise's combat. However, a through-line is apparent from Origins to Inquisition: BioWare seemingly wants this franchise to be action but has attempted to shift to that without abandoning its longtime fans. \nWith Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has completed its transition from strategy to real-time action, but thanks to an optional tactical pause-and-play combat wheel that harkens back to the series' origins, I feel it's found a great (battle)ground …",

But something about that game has stuck with players. In addition to resonating with a wider audience than many of From Software's most iconic titles to that point, Bloodborne delivered an engrossing world full of mystery and challenge, causing it to remain top-of-mind for many Soulslike fans even today. In the lead-up to the launch of Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, I sat down with the creator of Elden Ring, Dark Souls, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Demon's Souls, and Bloodborne to learn why the 2015 PS4 exclusive holds as special a place in his heart as it does the game's many fans.\nFor Miyaz…",

          "description": "Hot off the Boston Celtics' NBA Finals victory last night, we learned of a new way we can step onto the court this summer. Nintendo Switch Sports, the successor to the overwhelmingly popular Wii Sports series, arrived in 2022. While the initial offerings lacked depth and sometimes left us craving more than the base game was able to deliver, Nintendo has stuck with the title and has improved the offerings through free updates. A few months after launch, the title added golf at no additional charge, and during today's Nintendo Direct, we learned that another free update is coming to the game this summer to add basketball to the mix.\nNintendo Switch Sports' implementation of basketball uses motion controls to dribble, pass, and shoot. You can participate in two-on-two matches locally, or compete in Five-Streak Battle matches and Three-Point Contests. You can also take part in a solo Three-Point Challenge, where you need to make as many baskets as you can before time expires.\nNintendo Switch Sports' basketball free update arrives this summer.

          "description": "We recently learned about five Mega Man games arriving on Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy catalog, but Nintendo has recently focused an increasing amount of its catalog efforts on more obscure titles or those that never came to the West. With many of the most classic titles already on Nintendo Switch Online's various catalogs, the output has decreased significantly. However, during today's Nintendo Direct, four of the most requested games were announced for release today.\nMetroid: Zero Mission, the excellent Game Boy Advance remake of the original Metroid, and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords, the Game Boy Advance remake of the classic SNES title but with a separate co-op campaign, come to Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy Advance catalog. On top of that, Nintendo announced the Nintendo 64 catalog is getting two M-rated entries: Perfect Dark, the GoldenEye 007 spiritual successor from developer Rare, and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter.\nAs a reminder, the NES, SNES, and Game Boy libraries are included in the base Nintendo Switch Online subscription, while Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance, and Sega Genesis catalogs require you to upgrade to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription. As such, to access all of the games announced and released today, you'll need to subscribe to that premium membership. The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords and Metroid: Zero Mission join the Game Boy Advance library today, while Perfect Dark and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter join the Nintendo 64 catalog today.",

          "description": "In recent years, Capcom has really shown its dedication to the Ace Attorney series by bringing the games to modern consoles. The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles brought two games to the West for the first time, while the Apollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy gave the newest games in the series a facelift. Today, with the announcement of Ace Attorney Investigations Collection, Capcom is not just bringing another Japan-only release to Western gamers, but it's also made the entire library of Ace Attorney games available on modern consoles.\n\n\nThe Investigations games follow Miles Edgeworth, an antagonist turned reluctant ally from the original trilogy of Phoenix Wright games. Instead of defending suspects in court, Edgeworth is a prosecutor, so it's up to him to build a case against the main suspects. By collecting evidence and completing logic puzzles, he and the lovable Detective Gumshoe solve mysteries and serve justice. While the first game launched in the States as a DS title, the second never officially made it over, so this is many players' first chance to see its story.\nLike other Ace Attorney collections, the Ace Attorney Investigations Collection will have a number of modes and settings for fans to appreciate the art and music of the original game. While it includes new \"hand-drawn character visuals\" for a more modern look, it also allows players to switch to classic pixel sprites if they prefer the look of the original. Meanwhile, the gallery includes character art, a photo album, and music from the game, including orchestral arrangements.\nWhile the announcement was made during the Nintendo Direct, Ace Attorney Investigations collection is far from a console exclusive – the two-game collection will launch on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 6.",

Super Mario Party Jamboree is a brand-new entry in the franchise, but it’s looking as if the general thrust of play remains mostly intact, with a few notable additions.\nThe reveal trailer shows Mario and friends descending on a small archipelago of islands that make up a massive resort. Across the many boards, players can encounter 110 different minigames.\nJamboree includes five new boards – Mega Wiggler’s Tree Party, King Bowser’s Keep, Roll ‘em Raceway, Goomba Lagoon, and Rainbow Galleria – plus returning boards from earlier games, including Mario’s Rainbow Castle (From Mario Party) and Western Land (from Mario Party 2). We got to see a bit of how the board games play out in a couple of these locales. Roll ‘em Raceway includes a turbo dice item that allows player Karts to zip forward up to 40 spaces with a good roll. In Goomba Lagoon, a changing tide adjusts the path across the board.\nThe most surprising addition is the new Koopathlon game mode, which allows up to 20 players to jump in together online. The early gameplay on offer here calls to mind other online party titles like Fall Guys.\nNintendo is touting Jamboree as the largest game in the series. We’ll see how true that is when the game launches for Switch on October 17.",

In today's Nintendo Direct, that wish was finally granted; in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, it's up to Princess Zelda to save Hyrule when Link is captured.\n\n\nWhile the game takes its art style from 2019's Link's Awakening remake, this title is not a remake of any kind, and there's no clear indication that it is connected to Link's Awakening.

          "description": "We finally have a look at Metroid Prime 4 outside of just a logo. The game is releasing in 2025 and is officially titled Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. The game has had its various tribulations since its announcement in 2017. It was originally being developed by Bandai Namco, but was later restarted and moved over to Retro Studios, the developer behind the the first three Metroid Prime games.\n\n\nFinally seeing the game is action is exciting, but in a way, not surprising. The action is reminiscent of Retro's other Metroid games (which is a good thing). We see Samus land on a planet clearly in the middle of a battle in a new ship, she moves around, scans elements of the environment, attacks monsters, and turns into a Morph Ball. We all see a tease of a new enemy who has a pair of Metroids floating over their shoulder.\nFor our review of the recent Metroid Prime remaster, head here.",

The title arrived as an Apple Arcade exclusive in 2021 and currently holds an 80 out of 100 on reviews aggregate site Metacritic. It also won the award for Mobile game of the Year at the 25th Annual DICE Awards. \nMistwalker was founded in 2004 by Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, who produced Fantasian. The studio frequently collaborates with longtime Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu, who also worked on Fantasian as the composer. To date, Mistwalker has released multiple critically acclaimed games, including Blue Dragon, Lost Odyssey, and The Last Story.\nFantasian uses similar turn-based design conventions as were found in many of the most classic Final Fantasy games. The title also implements several quality-of-life modernizations, such as the ability to skip random encounters with enemy types you've already defeated until they choose to fight them all at once. Despite being a mobile title, Fantasian's ties to Apple Arcade means it does not include any microtransactions or paid DLC.\nFantasian Neo Dimension arrives on Nintendo Switch this holiday season.",

          "description": "Yars Rising is the successor of the 1982 Atari classic Yars' Revenge. However, on the surface, it has little to do with the original game created by Howard Scott Warshaw. After all, one is a 2D space shooter while another is a modernized sci-fi Metroidvania. However, with homages to Atari and gaming's past galore, all developed by a renowned studio like WayForward, this release could be one to look forward to when it arrives on its newly announced September release date.\nTaking control of a hacker named Emi (codename Yar), players must blast, hack, and sneak their way through various areas. As she progresses, she unlocks new powers that allow her to take out enemies more easily and, in true Metroidvania fashion, access new areas. Yars Rising is published by Atari and pays homage to the company's past, including bosses and minigames that borrow gameplay elements from classic Atari titles.\nThough the game is coming to a broader array of platforms, PlayStation 5 and Switch players can pick up physical editions of the game. We recently had a chance to go hands-on with Yars Rising and included our impressions in our list of the coolest things we saw at Summer Game Fest. To read that entry and see the rest of the list, head here. Yars Rising arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 10.",

This means that players will have the opportunity to drive around Mexico in a 2024 Ford Mustang Dark Horse, 2023 Hyundai IONIQ 5 N, 2021 Toyta GR Yaris, 2023 Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo Turbo S, and 2023 Kia EV6 GT. However, for many, those are unlikely to be the highlight of this batch of releases. Available tomorrow, Forza Horizon 5 is bringing several iconic vehicles from Universal Studios films and TV shows.\nThe Universal Icons Car Pack adds KITT from Knight Rider, Jurassic Park's 1992 Jeep Wrangler Sahara, and a distinct version of the Delorean Time Machine from each Back to the Future film in the trilogy. Each Time Machine features a unique look and visual effects once you hit 88 miles per hour. The Jurassic Park Wrangler features the park's logo as well as the iconic color scheme from the film. Finally, KITT includes a body kit that includes Super Pursuit Mode.\nThis isn't the first time Forza Horizon 5 has introduced licensed vehicles from pop-culture properties. Players can already purchase the Forza Horizon 5: Fast X Car Pack as well as the Forza Horizon 5: Hot Wheels expansion. In addition to those aforementioned vehicles, this season adds 17 EventLab props to help players build modern highways and a robot collectible out in the world.\nWe absolutely loved Forza Horizon 5 when it came out in 2021, awarding it a 9.5 out of 10, naming it one of the top 10 games of 2021, and awarding it both Best Microsoft Exclusive and Best Racing Game for that year. The Universal Icons Car Pack will be available tomorrow, June 18. The Mustang arrives on June 20, the IONIQ and EV6 land in-game on June 27. The Yaris comes out on July 4 and the Taycan on July 11.",

The studio is the latest to be closed by the troubled company over the last 10 months. \nPieces Interactive’s website now only features a graphic listing “2007-2024 Thanks For Playing With Us” and a short blurb detailing its history: \nAlone in the Dark launched on March 20 to mixed reviews, currently sitting at a 63 on Metacritic. The game stars actors Jodie Comer and David Harbour, who lent their voices and likenesses, in a third-person reimagining of the 1992 survival horror classic. \n\n\nFollowing the collapse of a $2 billion deal with the Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group in 2023, Embracer has undergone a massive restructuring to stay afloat, resulting in a significant reduction of headcount across its many studios. That has included laying off over 1,000 employees (including those at Eidos-Montreal), selling off its studios (Saber Interactive, Gearbox Entertainment), and outright closing others (Free Radical Design, Volition Games). Embracer has most recently split itself into three separate companies, with its studios divided among them.",

          "description": "Fans of the A Quiet Place films may remember that a video game based on the franchise was announced almost three years ago. After years of worrying yet oddly appropriate silence, publisher Saber Interactive has revealed the title and first trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead.\nThe first-person adventure is an original story starring a young woman who must trek across a new area of the film’s post-apocalyptic landscape for unknown reasons (though the game’s description mentions she’s dealing with some kind of family drama). Like the movies, keeping quiet to avoid the wrath of the sound-sensitive alien invaders requires using tools such as a customized microphone that measures the sound levels in an area. \n\n\nStealth is key, and players must carefully observe environments to create their own paths while avoiding noise-making hazards such as stepping on broken glass, as seen in the video. The trailer didn’t show any combat, but if it’s anything like the films, guns are likely to be present but perhaps deemphasized (they're quite loud, you see). \nInterestingly, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead seems to have switched developers. When the game was first announced, Illogika was at the helm. Now, the game credits Stormind Games, the team behind the Remothered horror series and, most recently, Batora: Lost Haven. \nA Quiet Place: The Road Ahead was originally slated to launch in 2022, the same year A Quiet Place Part II hit theaters.

Dragami revealed this release date in RePop's first trailer, which shows off some of the remastered gameplay and the characters players will meet in the game.  Lollipop Chainsaw represents a collaboration between Goichi \"Suda51\" Suda (No More Heroes, Killer7), and Guardians of the Galaxy director and now DC film head James Gunn. At the time of Lollipop Chainsaw's release, Gunn was known primarily for directing the films Slither and Super, and writing the two live-action Scooby Doo films and Zach Snyder's Dawn of the Dead remake. We spoke with Suda51 recently about his career and whether or not he keeps up with James Gunn.\nAlongside the trailer, Dragami has also released various details related to the remaster of Chainsaw Lollipop, including word that PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC players can enjoy the game with 4K resolution and 60 FPS (the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch versions support 1080p resolution and 30 FPS). Dragami says RePop has shorter load times, improved camera and keystroke response, increased attack speed, and faster movement speed, too. \nPlus, the Chainsaw Blaster now has \"auto rock on,\" an auto-fire mode, and an increased maximum ammunition count, while combos are now usable from the start of the game. Nick Roulette has received some changes, and so have minigames. Plus, a new auto-QTE feature is on by default now. \nCheck all of it out for yourself in the Chainsaw Lollipop RePop gameplay trailer below: \n\n\nLollipop Chainsaw RePop will be available on September 25 for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. \n For more, read Game Informer's original Lollipop Chainsaw review here. \nAre you going to be playing Chainsaw Lollipop RePop this September?

          "description": "In a universe where bagels meet bars, the BAGEL engine has been perfectly toasted, and the ScummVM team is now ready to serve a slice of The Space Bar nostalgia. No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.\nThis is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.\nIf you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.\nNow, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)\n>",
