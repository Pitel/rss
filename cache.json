          "description": "Well, that's something at least!\nAs you will all likely know by now (we hope), the 3DS and Wii U eShops will no longer allow users to purchase or download new games onto their systems come March 27th, 2023.\nNintendo has been reasonably forthright regarding what will and won't be possible after this date, but one question that's been lingering in our minds in recent months is whether or not users will be able to perform a complete system transfer between two 3DS consoles, including downloaded software and eShop accounts. System transfers require an internet connection and authentication via Nintendo's servers, and not being able to transfer to another console would cause problems if, for example, the case got damaged somehow, or perhaps you wanted to upgrade to a New 2/3DS in the future.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

To celebrate, we're republishing this ranked list of all the Contra games that came to Nintendo platforms in one form or another. Enjoy!\n\nContra is one of a handful of franchises that have become completely synonymous with gaming; indeed, chances are if you haven't played any Contra games, then you'll have at least heard of them. Konami's run-and-shoot-'em-up behemoth may have lost a lot of its lustre in recent years (pretty much par for the course with Konami these days, it seems, save for some excellent retro collections), but its earlier iterations have become iconic in their own right.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Chief amongst these is the hope for some Zelda sets which, in the build up to Tears of the Kingdom, have kept the rumour mill churning over the past few months in particular.\nJust last month we heard of a Breath of the Wild set that had qualified for official review (presumably slipping in before LEGO blocked any further Zelda-themed submissions) and now we have seen yet another design that is doing the rounds on LEGO forums (thanks, Nintendo Everything). Before we dive into the details, it is worth bearing in mind that this is still heavy rumour talk.

It's a bit like Blood Bowl, oddly, in that it's all about mitigating risks. And like Blood Bowl, despite having a decent head for tactics and planning on the fly, I am hopeless at sticking to them when I see a new idea, thus: terrible. At it.\nBut since an update last March looks likely to be its last big one, it's about time to get over myself and gave it a proper look as a complete package. It's long overdue, in fact. Although I still struggle to fully enjoy it, Battle Brothers is an unusually good tactical game, and the one to beat for the burgeoning subgenre of mercenary management sims. That's partly because it sticks so resolutely to its guns. Where Bannerlord faltered by throwing extraneous stuff unrelated to the core combat that should have defined it, and other open world games typically take a varied but shallow \"do and be everything\" approach, Battle Brothers resists dilution of that core concept.\nRead more",

We also discuss the reasons a developer might have to come out and clarify that their game is, in fact, real.

If KeokeN's Deliver Us games are anything to go by, though, life in outer space isn't all that peachy either. In Deliver Us The Moon, you may remember the scientists in charge of the moon's Earth-saving energy beam tech ended up having a bit of a Rapture moment, sabotaging all their good work (and the future of Earth in the process) and buggering off to goodness knows where to start life afresh in their newly birthed utopia. In its sequel, Deliver Us Mars, you find out those rogue astronauts didn't actually go that far at all. Yep, they hopped on over to the red planet and set up shop there, and when a strange transmission comes through revealing their location, it serves as the catalyst to send yet another crew into space to go and investigate. \r\n\nThis time, though, you're right at the heart of its central conflict. By casting players as Kathy, the daughter of one of those rogue astronauts, Deliver Us Mars tells a much more fraught and personal tale of what kind of future humanity should be pursuing: should we, in fact, be turning our efforts toward a life in outer space, or should we be doing everything in our power to try and save the dire, pretty much almost dead husk of a planet we call home? \nRead more",

I might smugly write something like “it elevates the genre” while sipping wine and eating cheese, musing on how a game pushes the media forward as an art form. Other times I just want to write that a game is really bloody good, actually, and I like it lots.\nHi-Fi Rush falls into the latter category. Developer Tango Gameworks shadow-dropped the rhythm-action game out of nowhere shortly after an Xbox presentation, jettisoning The Evil Within’s murky mental hospitals and Ghostwire: Tokyo's supernatural shinanigans for something markedly different: bright pulsating neon colours and a gang of loveable anime ruffians, where every whack and dodge is underscored by a beat. \nHi-Fi Rush is an action-adventure game with a mechanical core fuelled by musical beats. Protagonist Chai has undergone a risky medical procedure and emerged from the other side with a robot arm and an iPod accidentally implanted in his chest meaning his every waking moment is punctuated by a catchy beat. We too see these rhythmic motions, as Hi-Fi Rush's soda pop-infused world moves to this steady pulse - platforms move in time with the music, lights flash in pleasing rhythmic patterns, and enemies attack to the beat of the drum. \nRead more",

It’s Minecraft! Of course it was game of the year. It was arguably the game of the decade, an absolute all timer. I won’t spend many words explaining why it is good, because those words would be redundant fodder, like the bloke fighting a soaring dragon by poking the ground under his feet with a sword.

          "description": "I loved Obsidian’s medieval mystery Pentiment when it released last November, and part of my admiration was for its incredible art style. It was like the dev team had nicked a bunch of 16th-century manuscripts, scanned the delicate pages, and then fully animated them to life.\nPentiment was clearly made by a team who had a deep love for the time period, and the same can be said for Inkulinati, a 2D turn-based strategy game that also uses illuminated medieval drawings. But Yaza Games have taken a bit of a different direction with Inkulinati's vibe by adding a whole heap of cheeky humour. You wouldn't think it would suit the stuffy nature of religious manuscripts, but actually those monks were pretty cheeky blokes, and Inkulinati's humour is done in a way that stays completely loyal to the source material, fart jokes and all.\nRead more",

This news comes after 95 employees lost their jobs, following mass layoffs across Microsoft. The layoffs affected long-time 343 devs, as well as contractors who only had a few days' notice. Halo Infinite has been trying to find its footing after a rocky first year, but this report doesn’t inspire much hope from fans, at least for the series’ short-term future. The report delves into the studio’s switch to a different engine, an upcoming battle royale game, and most importantly, the lack of any single-player content in development. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Jett: The Far Shore was, like the jagged colossi that roamed its lavender skies, an odd beast. When it emerged on the Epic Game Store in the autumn of 2021, you could see the conflict roiling in its belly - between the linear science fiction short story on the surface, and the freeroaming “Metroid snowboarding game” fighting to get out from underneath it.\n“Once the story finished, I hoped an endgame would open up and allow me to play freely in its world,” I wrote in our Jett review. “That I’d have more opportunities to watch great Ghoke, the red sun, rise in real time, and to ponder the Far Shore’s fascinating mysteries at length. Instead, I could only replay previous chapters. If only Jett had embraced a rhythm as organic as its inspired ecosystem.”\r\n\n\r\nWhen the Jett team read that review, they didn’t disagree. “You put your finger on it more accurately than anybody else, which was, ‘It really feels like this is building up to some sort of systemic-focused, open world endgame,’” says Superbrothers founder Craig Adams. “And internally we were like, ‘Yeah, it is.’” What they knew, and I didn’t, was that The Far Shore was just the first part of a two-campaign story. That journey has now been completed with the launch of Given Time, a bonus 12-hour adventure that coincides with Jett’s long-awaited Steam release. \r\n\n \nRead more",

There's the eldest, who will always be heaped with praise because no matter what the others achieve, she did it all first. Her twin is always keen to remind you that even though she's the younger and perhaps not quite as accomplished half of the duo, she's more charismatic and less coy about who she is and what she wants. Then there's the youngest, who's extremely likeable, in large part because she's learned what behaviours to avoid just by watching the others make mistakes; even if she's modelled herself on the eldest a bit too closely in her quest for approval, and so hasn't really forged her own identity.\nThen there's Life Is Strange 2: the awkward middle child. Still very recognisably a member of the family, but the one that stands out in all the photos because he's just a bit gawky. He's experimented a lot with his storytelling and plotline in an attempt to make himself stand out, and it's only sort-of worked.

          "description": "Last Friday afternoon, 40 developers from Ubisoft Paris gathered to strike in the first labour stoppage of Ubisoft’s history. It's the capper on what has been a turbulent month for the company. Three weeks ago Ubisoft announced they were cancelling three unannounced games amid “worsening macroeconomic conditions.” In a letter to employees, CEO Yves Guillemot said that “the ball is in your court” in regard to hitting deadlines and overturning Ubisoft’s sticky financial situation. French union Solidaires Informatique said that Guillemot’s \"words mean something: overtime, managerial pressure, burnout, etc,\" and called on Ubisoft Paris employees to strike for better pay and working hours. It seems some devs heard the call.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The road to launch has been a uniquely turbulent one for The Settlers: New Allies. After an eight-year absence, the next entry in Ubisoft’s beloved city-building series was finally revealed in 2018, only to be delayed indefinitely two years later. The game then reemerged in a fresh new form in 2022, but a less than favourable reception from long-term fans to its closed beta saw the game delayed indefinitely once again.\r\n\n\r\n12 months later, The Settlers: New Allies is all the better for it. An extended delay is never an easy decision to make, yet the team at Ubisoft Düsseldorf (formerly Blue Byte) has seen this additional development time as an opportunity to reach out to those most familiar with the series. “We learned [more] than just what was needed for the game,” creative director Christian Hagerdorn tells me during a recent preview event. “One of our biggest focuses was to be absolutely transparent with the players. Not just on where we were standing, but where we were going. We've been collecting the feedback as we were developing”.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Such is the fate of Frey, who falls through a portal into Athia and finds that world in mortal peril. Although if I were here I'd be a bit disappointed. It's all very well being able to zoom around doing magic parkour everywhere, but there isn't much to do or many places to go. Not a single talking unicorn to be seen.\nForspoken is somehow both full and devoid of content. There is a huge open world, but it is mostly empty. There is an epic story of magic, other universes, and saving the world, but it only takes up a couple of days. I actually enjoyed a lot of Forspoken, but it gets more fun the more you play, and then it's over; I didn't pre-order this game for sixty odd quid, and if I had I'd be disappointed. Even the much-Tweeted about annoying dialogue doesn't happen much, and isn't contextually annoying. Forspoken is annoying, though, just not in the ways you might expect if all you've seen is people discussing out-of-context clips from cutscenes.\nRead more",

And before him, Ken Levine had laid down the cobbles of Thief’s setting, defining its noir-ish tone before heading off to work on System Shock 2. Yet Looking Glass games weren’t driven by a singular 90s auteur. In fact, the very absence of ego in the studio’s culture meant its many “bright stars” were happy to adhere to a shared vision.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It’s not outright broken, despite having been so on launch day, with problems ranging from drastic FPS dips to outright hard crashes. Following some impressively fast work from Valve themselves, focusing on hotfixes for SteamOS’ Proton compatibility software, Dead Space’s Deck performance has become more or less manageable.

THR states that Amazon is looking to \"build out a connected world of Tomb Raider, with the video game, TV series and film.\" This sounds a little ambitious, considering that Crytal Dynamics' game is already in production, so we'll have to wait and see how the adaptations interact with the games.\r\n\n \nRead more",

So I reinstalled the game I already own. Turns out, after a few vital (yet easy) tweaks and fixes, the 2008 game is still perfectly playable. If you too wish to once again to CUT OFF THEIR LIMBS and are uncertain about ponying up £50, here's how to get the original working well on PC.\nRead more",

Forget any thoughts of friendly assistance to rack up a high score though, because this game’s subtitle is Hostile Pinball Action.

          "description": "Above the Berlin Samurai Museum's gift shop and flanked by ornate helmets of fearsome warriors of a bygone era, I played a few hours of Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio's remake of historical Yakuza spin-off Like A Dragon: Ishin this week. The original was a Japanese-only release back in 2014 on the PlayStation 3, but what a fever dream it was to be dropped into Chapter 3 of the story and let loose on an Edo period Kyoto as none other than Ryoma Sakamoto (multiverse Kiryu). I almost cried, I raced chickens, I caught a big eel, and I've come away with a warm fuzzy feeling inside.\nFrom what I've played of the game's earliest portions, it's Yakuza through and through, to both its benefit and detriment. I don't expect it to convert those who dislike the series, but if you're a fan or a newcomer, it's looking like it'll both be a celebration of its cast, and a remake that feels like an old-school spin on the excellent Yakuza 0. In other words, the perfect introduction point to this mad, but beautiful action series. \nRead more",

What a resume!\nBut did you know that our favourite space engineer also has lots of secret talents too? When Dead Space originally came out in the back end of 2008, his corporate overseers at EA sent Mr. Clarke to do all sorts of odd jobs before he popped off on the believeable, but bleak USG Ishimiura. Golf caddy, professional skateboarder, even a part-time dragon slayer. Heck, he's recently been back on the second gig train with his stint in Fortnite just earlier this week. The poor dude is in desperate need of a vacation. Until then, though, come and marvel at Isaac's many talents and see what a hard worker he is.\nRead more",

It's a sci-fi roguelike best played, I think, in 4-player online co-op. You play a sword-wielding combat mech. You also control a small frog standing on the mech. You drop onto proc-gen planets overrun by a kind of magical accelerated entropy, that turns everything black and pink and grey. By destroying totemic altars orbited by floating eyeball robots, you start to re-energise the planet, so areas have grass and butterflies. Eventually you will destroy enough totems to get to a planetary boss fight, which might be against, for example, a giant ghost samurai or a floating purple hand with an eyeball in it.

As far as I’m concerned, this remake allowed me to replay one of my all-time favourite games in a lavish new form, and in that sense, Dead Space is extraordinary.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Season: A Letter To The Future begins with a goodbye. You wander around your home for the last time, choosing five objects which inspire deep memories that spur each of the five senses. You then place them into a cauldron one by one, your mother keeping a watchful eye. The ritual comes to an end and the result is a small glowing pendant that will protect you from the dangers of the outside world. “You must promise me never to take the pendant off,” your mother says. The Goodbye ritual is finished, and you leave, knowing you’ll never see your mother or your hometown ever again, all as the prophecy foretold.\nIt’s a fantastic - if sad - start to Season, and gets straight to the heart of the adventure ahead of you. This is a world where prayers, rituals, and prophecies hold great weight, and where you'll be exploring the fragility and fickleness of memory. Underpinning everything is a deeply profound sense of melancholy - and here I was expecting some relaxing two-wheeling through lovely-looking landscapes. Well, turns out Season is a lot more than a pretty travelogue.\nRead more",

          "description": "7.1 million units shipped in the fall of 2022\nSony has released its financial results for the fiscal period ending December 31, 2022, revealing that the PlayStation 5 (PS5) hardware has surpassed 32.1 million units shipped units since its fall 2020 launch.\nAs per the report, Sony shipped an additional 7.1m consoles in the three-month period ending December 31, 2022, a massive increase of 3.1m units of the same time frame in 2021. This is expected to be due to the increased manufacture and availability of PS5 consoles in the latter half of the year, following the extended period of production downtime in the console's debut year, with both a lack of components and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic putting the brakes on the whole industry.\n\nAs a result of the increased shipment figures, Sony has raised its annual quarterly forecast for the remainder of the fiscal year. That is to say, the publisher now expects to ship a further 6.2m units worldwide in the current quarter, resulting in a grand total of 19m PS5 console shipments for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023.\nIn addition to the hardware shipment figures, Sony announced that it sold 86.5m software units (combined PS4 & PS5) during the three-month period ending December 31, 2022. This number is down around 6.2m units on the same period in the previous fiscal year (92.7m). Also continuing to decline are PlayStation Plus subscriptions, with a total of 46.4m subscribers recorded December 31, 2022, a decrease of 1.6m from the same period in the previous fiscal year (48m).\nOverall, however, PlayStation engagement is slightly up, with 112 million monthly active users on PlayStation Network, a one million user increase on the same period ending December 2021.\nThe post PS5 shipments pass the 32 million mark, quarterly forecast raised for March 31 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The theme park will provide Dream Land Deluxe players with a selection of fun mini-games, a few of which are new, while many of which have been recreated from their original appearance in some of Kirby's classic prior adventures.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJav9cmudMA&ab_channel=NintendoofAmerica\nThese multiplayer showdowns will include shooting galleries, bomb-tossing silliness, and even an amusingly stoic samurai showdown. The all-new \"Booming Blasters\" — essentially a Kirby-themed variant of the top-down carnage depicted in games such as Bomberman — looks to be a particular highlight. It's not all for naught, either, as while players enjoy games and explore the park, they will also earn stamps that can be traded in for new Copy abilities as well as various exclusive dress-up masks.\nKirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe launches exclusively on Nintendo Switch February 24.\nThe post New Kirby’s Return to Dream Land trailer spotlights ‘Merry Magoland’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

Note that the video (as Nintendo warns) does contain spoilers for the game. We won't mention them specifically here, but it does flash through scenes from mid-to-late game Bayonetta 3 story moments amid the footage of the performance. Folks who have finished the game already will likely get more out of it, especially given the emotional resonance of the song itself.\nThis is all great timing, as the powers that be are planning a full OST release for Bayonetta 3 this April, with a whopping 250 tracks across eight CDs. Here's the full breakdown of what the mega-release contains: \"It is the largest in the series, containing more than 250 tracks on 8 CDs. Liner notes are included, including explanations of all tracks and comments from the creators and directors. Beautifully packaged in a three-sided decorative box.

The important thing is I wanted more, so I was excited when Eggnut announced their next game would continue the series.\nTails: The Backbone Preludes is exactly that: a set of four short stories that flesh out Backbone’s characters.

          "description": "Cross your fingers and catch them all!\nIn the early days of the anime, Ditto was a little awkward with its shape-shifting. It could perfectly pull off every other detail except the face! It was almost horrific when the Pokémon would turn around and have this blank face, but at least it was easy to tell that it was Ditto. In the games, this little quirk is not present. If you're searching for a Ditto in Pokémon GO, unfortunately, there's no way to distinguish one in disguise from just a normal Pokémon. So how in the world do you catch one?\nHonestly, you just have to get lucky! That's a sucky answer, I know. Unfortunately, you won't know if a Pokémon is a Ditto in disguise until you catch it. Only once it is safely captured in the PokéBall will a little question pop up. Then Ditto's true form will be revealed. Of all of the Pokémon to catch, that has to be the most exciting then!\nThese tricky little blobs are pretty rare, and their shiny counterparts are even rarer. Don't worry though, a shiny Ditto will not be disguised as a shiny Pokémon. You don't have to be afraid that when you finally catch a shiny you've been looking forward to it will turn out to be a blue blob of putty.\nNiantic, the team behind Pokémon GO, doe not release an official list of Pokémon each month that are likely to be the shape-shifter. The whole idea is to have the illusion that it could be any of them. However, some sites, such as IGN, have a running list of likely disguises each month based on anecdotal evidence. People catch Ditto and seem to find monthly patterns, which makes sense from a tech standpoint.\nYou can't really train Ditto, and it's useless in battles, so you might as well just enjoy the lottery. Maybe you'll get lucky, maybe you won't. If you want more concrete tips on catching Pokémon in the mobile game, we have guides on how to catch Leafeon and Glaceon as well as how to catch Kecleon.\nThe post How to catch Ditto in Pokémon GO appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Time for fisticuffs\nSomething of a hidden gem has finally received an English localization, albeit from fans. Kaizou Choujin Shubibinman Zero (hereby known as Shockman Zero) is an entry in the Shockman series of games. While the series is better known for its entries on the PC-Engine/Turbografx-16, it got its sole Super Famicom release in 1997 via the Satellaview. Over here in the west, we only received Kaizou Choujin Shubibinman 2 in 1992 as Shockman, though it later saw re-release on Nintendo’s Virtual Console service on Wii and Wii U.\nThe Satellaview was an early digital download platform for the Super Famicom, which meant that after that service went offline, the title was no longer available. However, it got re-released in cartridge format via Columbus Circle in 2017. You can still find it available in some places if you’ve got a Super Famicom to stick it in.\n[caption id=\"attachment_360788\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Romhacking.net[/caption]\nShockman Zero is a delicious mix of Mega Man-style platformer and beat-’em-up. It’s as if the Blue Bomber defeated Fist Man and learned to throw hands. It has a distinct Japanese flavor that reminds me of Gunstar Heroes. It’s also a co-op, so you can smite baddies with a friend.\nThe translation comes courtesy of homebrewers Svambo and Anonymousse However, as this was a Japanese-only release previously, this might be the closest we ever get to an official translation. That is, unless a publisher wants to assemble all these games in a collection, which you could absolutely count me on board for. Stranger things have happened, like the upcoming Jajamaru Collections, for example.\nThe post Kaizou Choujin Shubibinman Zero has been fan translated as Shockman Zero appeared first on Destructoid.",

This latter edition will include a boxed physical edition of the game on PlayStation or Switch, alongside a 40-page artbook, a sticker set and key ring, art cards, and even a fun origami set, representing the magic of our monster-mashing Kazimono sisters, Shinobu and Maya.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeN47PDxyiQ&ab_channel=PQube\nGrim Guardians: Demon Purge is a pixelated 2D adventure that marries a Castlevania's Gothic aesthetic with the run 'n' gun chaos of a Gunvolt. One or two players will lead the Kazimono sisters deep into the dark dungeons of a demonic castle, determined to purge its evil from their village school. Younger sibling Maya will be looking to bring down a battalion of hellish opponents with her lethal *checks notes* origami skills, while her older sister Shinobu is, somewhat more traditionally, going with good old-fashioned lead — delivered accurately and with speed.\n\nInti Creates' stylish-looking title shifted onto my radar at the end of the era, thanks to its cool pixelated visuals, cheesecake anime style, and interesting mix of magic and bombastic action.

This February 1, 2023 update addresses Pokemon Scarlet & Violet, but it doesn't quite add full Home support just yet.\nPrimarily, it looks at adding ranked battle info in the mix, as well as battle results from Sword & Shield (remember those?!). The catch is that you'll need to link your Home account to a Nintendo account with data from the newest generation: otherwise you won't be able to view said data. This is alongside of the typical \"other issues/various fixes\" vaguery in many AAA franchise patch notes.\nAs a reminder, full Scarlet & Violet access is still on track for \"spring 2023\" according to several listings on The Pokemon Company websites. It can't come soon enough! So far in terms of \"off book\" Pokemon releases we've gotten Charizard, Cinderace, and Greninja: as well as the full evolutionary lines for all three.\nPokemon Home version 2.1.0 full patch notes:\nAdded Ranked Battles information from Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet to the Battle Data feature.\nIf you've linked Pokémon HOME to a Nintendo Account with data from Pokémon Scarlet or Pokémon Violet, you'll now be able to view results from your Ranked Battles in Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet.\nYou can view your battle results from Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield by choosing View Past Battle Records.\nOther issues have also been addressed in order to ensure a user-friendly experience.\nThe post Pokémon Home was just updated to support Scarlet & Violet ranked data appeared first on Destructoid.",

Bringing forth some performance upgrades and new features, Shadow Warrior 3: Definitive Edition could be seen as the next-gen version. Existing owners of Shadow Warrior 3 will be getting a free upgrade to the new version.\nOriginally released in 2022, Shadow Warrior 3 took series protagonist Lo Wang back to his single-player roots after the more four-player co-op-focused Shadow Warrior 2. While it’s a more linear take than Flying Wild Hog’s previous games in the revival series, it introduced more movement options with dashing and wall-running.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/GL0mpzLbu1Y[/embed]\nThe headlining features are a survival mode, hardcore difficulty, and new game plus. Survival mode unlocks after you’ve beaten the main storyline and offers up some weapon skins if you can, uh… survive. Hardcore difficulty is, as the name suggests, a more challenging way to play through the game. Meanwhile, New Game Plus is a little less clear, with Devolver Digital saying that it allows you to “Enjoy additional challenges, rewards, and skins to give Lo-Wang that much-needed confidence boost.” They haven’t really said if you get to keep your upgrades for the second playthrough.\nAlong with these additions is hero mode, which introduces a life system to the gameplay. There is also a chapter selection, allowing you to replay your favorite slices of the game.\nIn terms of stepping up to the current generation of consoles, on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, there will be a performance mode for 60fps gameplay, or you can trade that for 4K visuals and 30fps.\nShadow Warrior 3 is currently available for PC, Xbox One, and PS4.

          "description": "Oh yeaaah, dig it!\nThe release of WWE 2K23 is fast approaching its March 17, 2023 date with retail, and to get you in the suplexing mood, 2K Sports has released a trailer showing off its WarGames mode. This mode features two rings, side-by-side within a steel cage, and has two teams facing off with each other with three or four members a piece. The members of each team are let into the cage in an alternating fashion, and the winning team is decided by pinfall or submission once everyone is inside.\nWarGames started off with Jim Crockett Promotions, which would become WCW. It would continue appearing throughout WCW’s run, which ended in 2001 when WWE (WWF at the time) bought them out. WarGames was then brought back in 2017 with the NXT brand, albeit with some minor changes.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/P529mRa_cog[/embed]\nWith the inclusion of two rings, this is actually a pretty big addition to the series. I expect to see many limitations in terms of what venue and mode it can be played in, but it could be a fun way to mix up multi-player. I just don’t want to see what the load times look like when you have two teams full of custom wrestlers.\nMore importantly, though, the trailer shows that “Macho Man” Randy Savage is once again on the roster this year for WWE 2K23. He looks about the same as he did in WWE 2K22, but my enthusiasm for the release would be significantly diminished if he wasn’t in it.\nWWE 2K23 will be available for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam on March 17, 2023.

As we previously reported, Electronic Arts FIFA 23 had an incredible launch week, racking up an incredible 10.3 million players within one week of its September 30, 2022 launch date.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tIW1X2dv0c&vl=en&ab_channel=EASPORTSFIFA\nIn a strange irony, what could prove to be the most successful Electronic Arts FIFA title of all time will also be the last collaboration between the game publisher and international football's statutory body. As of next year, Electronic Arts will launch its new brand, EA Sports FC, while the Federation Internationale de Football Association itself is hoping to find success with its own football simulation series.\nDespite the insistence by FIFA president Gianni Infantino that the new, official FIFA game will be \"the only authentic, real game\", and \"best one available for gamers and football fans\", I think we know where the development talent and marketing savvy really lie. And, given the skyrocketing success of FIFA 23, The FIFA federation may soon regret pricing itself out of one of — if not the — most consistently performing franchise in the entire history of video games.\nFIFA 23 is available now on  PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.\nEA says FIFA 23 is on track to be the biggest title in franchise history [VGC]\nThe post Electronic Arts’ FIFA 23 set to become franchise’s best-selling entry appeared first on Destructoid.",

This is especially the case on PC, where the option to disable VRS alone has helped the stability of that platform tremendously.\nFull Dead Space 1.03 patch notes\nDisabling VRS is now possible on PC\nAddressed PS5 stuttering\nAddressed the black screen bug\nGeneral stability and performance fixes\nA Dead Space Reddit community member has also provided a workaround for PC stuttering issues, if you're still having them:\nMaking sure power profile is set to AMD Performance Mode (it stutters on AMD Balanced)\nDisabling Exploit Protection in Windows for \"Dead Space.exe\" (need to add exception)This is very common resolution of stuttering in DX12 games, Horizon Zero Dawn had the same problem.\nDisable GPU scheduling (I've checked that during game GPU load is ~90% while CPU is ~60%, so I guess it's fine to do scheduling on CPU)\nDisabling Adobe Creative Cloud\nThe post The Dead Space remake just got a small update that fixes some bugs appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It'll be tough to match the excellence of Tomb Raider GO\nYesterday, we told you about the upcoming Street Fighter game that's launching on mobile. Today, it's Tomb Raider's turn. Lara Croft is set to return to iOS and Android devices this month with Tomb Raider Reloaded. Featuring the voice talents of Keeley Hawes and a look that harkens back to the golden era of this franchise, Reloaded sees gaming's most famous treasure hunter pillaging more ancient ruins in search of stuff to keep at her mansion. This time around, the locations she'll explore–which include famous locations like St. Francis' Folly and the Lost Valley–are procedurally generated. That's right, this game is a roguelike, and as you can see from the Tomb Raider Reloaded trailer below, it doesn't look too bad.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU9LTV1qvY0\nAfter having Lara Croft go through more \"realistic\" adventures, it's nice to see her back doing what she does best: fighting dinosaurs. Developed by Emerald City Games in collaboration with Crystal Dynamics – Eidos, Tomb Raider Reloaded will feature all the acrobatics Lara Croft is known for, as well as classic enemies, traps, and puzzles. Players will be able to upgrade Lara with new equipment and XP, and like every other free-to-play game on mobile, the developers hope to keep you booting the game up daily with events and challenges. Cellist Tina Guo, who was a featured soloist on the Grammy-nominated Journey soundtrack, is spearheading orchestral recordings of classic Tomb Raider songs for the game.\nTomb Raider Reloaded will launch worldwide on February 14, 2023. You can download it for iOS or Android, and if you have a Netflix subscription, you can access the game without any of the ads and microtransactions found in the free-to-play version.\nThe post Lara Croft is taking another shot at mobile this month with Tomb Raider Reloaded appeared first on Destructoid.",

Bungie just showed off seven more that are arriving in the mix with the Lightfall expansion, and things look promising so far: especially from an aesthetic perspective.\n[gallery link=\"file\" columns=\"7\" size=\"medium\" ids=\"360761,360762,360763,360764,360765,360766,360767\"]\nHere are the exotics shown off in the newest Destiny 2: Lightfall trailer, as well as how they work:\nFinal Warning (Charged tracking rounds)\nDeterministic Chaos (Rhythmic debuffs)\nCyrtarachne's Facade (Grappple gives woven mail)\nAbeyant Leap (Barricade spawns additional lashes)\nQuicksilver Storm (Grenades create tangles on kills)\nSwarmers (Destroying tangles spawns threadlings)\nWinterbite (Freeze enemies with frost orb)\nExpect more exotics to show up as the seasons progress, as well as raid-specific gear that will be kept secret until the raid itself hits.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LK2zmFr5wV4\nKeep moving forward\nLooking back on the last few years of Destiny, it's been a wild ride. One of the most off-the-rails tracks was definitely Destiny's foray into the Stadia realm (with hiccups): followed by its recent crash. I know some of the playerbase has been worn out by the last few expansions, but the vibrant neon hues of Lightfall could go a long way in terms of bringing me back.\nWe'll see how it turns out on February 28!\nThe post The new Destiny 2 exotics coming with Lightfall look like fun appeared first on Destructoid.",

Within this labyrinthine, trap-laden sanctuary&nbsp;lurks a deadly creature that stalks the player, who must use their resourcefulness to survive. If you’re a fan of Alien: Isolation, The Bunker appears to aim for a similar style with a heaping dose of its signature mind-bending scares.

This match-up consists of multiple back-to-back games with players using the same decks throughout. Players start with 10 health each and whoever wins a game deals 1 point of damage. However, this damage can be doubled by snapping. A player loses when their health hits zero, and there’s no round limit.&nbsp;Developer Second Dinner&nbsp;states that Battle Mode will receive updates expanding its features over the coming months.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For more on Marvel Snap, check out its spot on our <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/goty-2022/2022/12/23/game-informers-top-10-games-of-2022\" target=\"_blank\">Top 10 Games of 2022</a> to find out what makes it so special.

Movie new teaser cat suit donkey kong Seth Rogen Chris Pratt\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" class=\"image-style-body-default\" /></p>\n\n\n      <p>Nintendo and Illumination have released a new teaser that reveals Mario's famous cat suit as well as more of Seth Rogen's Donkey Kong.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Released during one of yesterday's big NFL games, this teaser is short and sweet, but it features 10 or so seconds of new footage from The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which hits theaters on April 7. In it, we see Donkey Kong begin to pummel Mario, which is a clip we've seen before, before Mario hits a yellow \"?\" block. This gives him the cat suit powerup and while it's useful in the game, that doesn't appear to be the case here as Rogen's Donkey Kong begins to make fun of the suit and Mario's reliance on it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Check it out for yourself in The Super Mario Bros. Movie clip below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Aq7ilIgN2I\" width=\"\"></iframe>\n\n<p>As you can see, this is the most Donkey Kong dialogue we have heard in a teaser for The Super Mario Bros. Movie yet, and it reveals that Rogen's character is basically just him, complete with his signature laugh, too. This clip is yet another that looks great and we can't wait for this movie to hit theaters in a few months on April 7.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For more, <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/11/29/latest-super-mario-bros-movie-trailer-showcases-peach-and-donkey-kong\" target=\"_blank\">check out this trailer from last year that showcases Anya Taylor-Joy's Princess Peach</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p><em>What do you think of this new clip?

In addition to detailing how players will liberate the town of Redfall from its vampiric captors, the team also shared a release date: May 2.</p>\n\n<p>The bulk of the presentation showed off how players, either alone or working with up to three other friends, will cleanse Redfall of vampires neighborhood by neighborhood. In addition to gathering intel about the island and completing side quests, such as rescuing human hostages, you’ll capture safehouses. These become additional human HQs, and gaining more brings you closer to battling the area’s ruling vampire underboss. These elite enemies boast unique attacks and require your full might, along with your team’s efforts, to kill for good.</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cR8GVePOdpY\" width=\"\"></iframe>\n\n<p>We also got a look at vampire nests. A giant heart fuels these otherworldly dens, and infiltrating one means cutting the heart from the body. Swarms of vampires will try to stop you, of course, but succeeding causes the collapse of a nest, meaning you’ll have to get out fast. Additionally, Arkane showed off the Shroud enemy type, a vampire that can blanket areas in pitch darkness, fire projectiles, as well as phase through floors to evade danger. We also saw a little more of the heroes’ specialized abilities and upgrades, such as granting Layla’s umbrella with a perk that allows it to absorb and fire incoming bullets.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Redfall will be available on Xbox Series X/S and PC and will be available on Game Pass at launch.</p>",

Double-click on her door to open it, and step inside. Riddenbutter works the bar, and the smart traveler should speak with her. Drop an idea on her to get her chatting. Like most people, she likes to talk about this and that and the other thing, and she’ll also frequently respond with information that’s more local in nature.\nYes, the ScummVM team announces support for Halls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II, a marvellous work by our GSoC’21 student Yuri Guimaraes aka a-yyg, who ported the original SAGA2 engine from 1997 by The Dreamers Guild.\nPlease assist us with testing this game. Take your old dusty CD and feed it to the ScummVM. As usual, you will need the latest daily build of ScummVM.
