This time around, there’s a world-map to explore, but be careful – there are no turns to take on the Great Sea, so you’ll have to engage in real-time naval combat against enemy vessels.

A human-made multiverse — made up of Prime, the Overworld, the Underworld, and the Hyperworld — is collapsing, and the only way to fix it is to merge all of the different worlds back together.\nYou play as three different versions, called counterselves, of a woman named Maya: Altara, Kera, and Naira. Each comes from a different world and has different abilities. Altara has access to unique ranged weapons thanks to her prosthetic arm and a double jump. Naira can wall jump.

Well, if that’s what you’re looking for, and you don’t mind muddy textures, a little funky translation, and blocky 3D models, then this is just the game for you.\nNatsu-Mon: 20th Century Summer Kid takes place in Japan right around the turn of the millennium. August 1999, to be exact. You play as 10-year-old Satoru, who’s traveling with his circus-owning parents, and since you’re only a kid, you aren't performing and instead have all the free time in the world for the 31 days the circus is in town. Each day follows roughly the same structure. Wake up, eat breakfast, do morning stretches, and then you’re free to do what you please until 5pm, when dinner-munching commences, and afterward, you’ll also have some nightlife hours before you enter dreamland.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

I first visited the burnt-out ruins of this zombie-infested world a decade ago and I returned to it this week to find a tree-puncher that, despite bearing the pockmarks of early access, retains much of what made it enjoyable back when the survival genre was still wearing its baby onesie. Instead of a review, I figured I'd scribble together a mini starter guide for new (or returning) players. Partly because the game is a proper time sink and it was taking me so long to get through everything. But mostly because I wanted to use that numberful headline.

It's scrappy too in that it's, well. It's Stalingrad. Not really: its world is so fictional it's their 15th century. But the invaders are explicitly fascists and the defenders communists embroiled in a long and brutal semi-guerrilla city war with World War 2 technology. Thankfully, it's stripped of any actual fashy or genocidal play-acting beyond each side doing \"hail the empire/union\" bits as a sign off.\nI think that's why, despite its brutal and difficult setting, it's this year's entry in the long tradition of Low-Intensity Strategy Games For When Hot Why Hot Please Stop You Cannot See My Begging Tears For They Evaporate.\nRead more",

The new game - currently untitled and without a release date - is a first-person sci-fi RPG set in an alternate-1900s North America, which ostensibly combines the ingenuity and gadgetry of Dishonored and Prey with a \"real RPG\" experience redolent of Skyrim and modern-day Fallout.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's got a default jump range of 17.55 light years and two big prongs sticking out of its face like a sci-fi forklift. Cool. The catch is that this ship can only be bought with real money for now, say the developers. This is part of Frontier's new strategy of having paid-for ships in the game. I don't really play Elite Dangerous anymore, so I don't have strong feelings about that. But I do have strong feelings about the space trucker advertisement the developer has put together for the new ship. Come watch it with me.\nRead more",

The supermarket chain – third biggest in the UK by turnover and purveyors of ill-fitting clothes and surprisingly good doughnuts alike – has added light-up gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets to its mountain of own-brand wares.\nAsda being what it is (Americans, if you’re unfamiliar, think Walmart with less gun violence), it’s all dirt cheap as well. £17 for a full-size keyboard. £16 for an FPS mouse. Overwhelmed with curiosity, I ended up taking home a complete starter set (keeb, different mouse, headset, and mousemat) for £45, or about a third of the price of the Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL that I’d shortly kick off my desk. Could this be a new frontier in affordable PC hardware, bringing tech to the masses in a way no specialist retailer ever could, or should supermarkets stick to cereal and meal deals?

I'm pretty sure not having eight gigs of RAM is heretical, but never fear, you can probably compensate by taking a leaf from the God-Emperor's book and arrange for a host of dying psykers to pour their brain energy into your motherboard.\nAll of which is to say that Focus Home have released the system requirements for huge-shouldered action game Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2.

We had Deviator last week - now, it's time for a bumper helping of the heebie-jeebies in the shape of Perennial Order. The title makes it sound like an eBay delivery of potted geraniums. The game festering beneath is actually a \"plant horror\" boss rusher with twin stick melee controls, unlockable \"Instinct\" abilities and one-hit deaths.\nIn a gift to headline writers everywhere, the developers, four-person Gardenfiend Games, are calling it \"Hollow Knight meets Titan Souls\", and who am I to deny them? It's got one of those \"painterly\" art styles, too, though other words come to mind, such as \"rotted\" and \"unhallowed\" and \"manky\". It's out on 6th September.

Leaves flutter, rays of sun cavort through trees, and the music is utterly gorgeous. The game opens on twinkly piano and mournful strings, infused with a good dose of stirring JRPG whimsy, and soon transforms into whatever the genre of music is called that makes you want to immediately go on a massive adventure.

I dunno about that, though between the Asus ROG Ally X and the Steam Deck OLED, those who stayed their hand on their earlier handheld gaming PC counterparts do have a couple of quality second-genners to choose from. Valve’s effort manages to wring multiple performance, design, and battery life improvements out of its new display, while the ROG Ally X makes similar upgrades with a bigger-yet-better take on the original ROG Ally.\nThe only thing to do, clearly, is make them fight. It’s probably in the Irish Code Duello or something: \"Should one portable games box impugn another’s honour by releasing shortly after it, satisfaction must be claimed through a comparison article.\" My hands are bound here, folks, though if you yourself have been playing the waiting game on a handheld purchase, perhaps this little head-to-head can help you pick the right one.\nRead more",

You awake to a world of tree trunks that twist like viscera and corroded contraptions powered by luminous goop that’s stored in the balls, uh, big glass orbs. A beam of light soon fills your character with newfound vigour, which is a nice moment of triumph in what otherwise feels like a deeply oppressive rust pit, all unsteady platforms and jagged pipes.\nIt doesn’t take long before you start spotting examples of the reason Bionic Bay went viral earlier this week. Above your head hangs a painstakingly detailed mass of vents and cables, looming lifelike with dust and shadow and history. I stood and stared because I’d seen how the sausage was made, but I like to think I would have lingered longer than usual anyway. It really is just that impressive.\nRead more",

So if there's only one person in your village who knows how to brew tastier beer, and they die after being freakishly savaged by a passing wolf (it happens), suddenly your village will have no artisanal lager master. The results may be devastating. Luckily, you can share knowledge in a number of ways - by copying books, or having \"wise conversations\". The exception to this is child characters, whose pea-sized brains can't learn specialist knowledge, only soaking up basic attributes like \"manners\" from the teachers you assign to them. Well, until now. The developers for the Rimworld-meets-Crusader Kings catastrophe simulator have made kids a little smarter.

It seems just yesterday I was getting very jealous at Matthew Castle (RPS in peace) for getting to preview the sequel to my beloved Shadows Of Amn. Fast forward several turns, Larian’s RPG banger is officially one year old since release, and there’s now a much higher chance that strangers at pubs will understand why my failed romance with Jaheira as a youth was such a deeply heartbreaking experience. Baldur’s Gate 3 itself looks to be done and dusted following the upcoming patch, but Larian now seem to be gearing up for their next charm offensive with a new “community focused” YouTube channel, as well as further teasing their two games currently in development.\nRead more",

Watching THQ Nordic's new Gothic Remake trailer, below, feels a little like watching a vivisectionist parade about in somebody else's skin. Still, the remake's developers Alkimia Interactive aren't to blame for Embracer's fuck-ups, and I am selfishly happy to see Gothic return as an Unreal Engine 5 production - even if I didn't play the original back in 2001.\r\n\n\r\nSin did play the original game, and in her 2016 retrospective, she paints an absorbing picture of a dark fantasy \"microsociety\" in which every community \"has a reason to exist, a means of providing for itself, a social order, and a long term goal\".

World Of Goo 2 pursues that sense of novelty with just as much twitchy eagerness as its predecessor, throwing new toys and goos at the player in an effort to keep you on your sludge-coated toes. That pursuit doesn't always result in pleasing new levels, though. There is a \"hit and miss\" feeling to things this time around. But those hits are hits.

On the other, it makes me think of side-scrolling Soulslikes (Scroulslikes?) such as Blasphemous and the frantic worldbuilding of Rick & Morty.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Few acts in games feel quite as gleefully gratifying as removing a knight’s shiny dome with a halberd swing in medieval multiplayer melee Chivalry 2. In a pastime that’s had several decades to perfect the art of hitting men with sharp objects, that’s quite the accomplishment. Since releasing in 2022, Torn Banner have lavished the player base with free horses, angry peasants, and most recently, the Regicide update - hosting a climatic tete-a-tete between two angry crownmen. With work on No More Room In Hell 2 well underway though, Torn Banner have decided to call it on Chiv 2, which they now consider “feature complete.”\n \nRead more",

It's possible, however, that Overwatch 2 will swing back in the other direction, as Blizzard are now \"exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results\", with a view to restoring some of the joyful chaos that saw entire teams of Reinhardts charging the objective in formation.\n Read more",

The AMD Ryzen 9000 series starting with the Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X launching tomorrow are some truly great desktop processors. The generational uplift is very compelling, even in single-threaded Linux workloads shooting ahead of Intel's 14th Gen Core competition, across nearly 400 benchmarks these new Zen 5 desktop CPUs impress, and these new Zen 5 desktop processors are priced competitively. I was already loving the Ryzen 7000 series performance on Linux with its AVX-512 implementation and performing so well across hundreds of different Linux workloads but now with the AMD Ryzen 9000 series, AMD is hitting it out of the ball park. That paired with the issues Intel is currently experiencing for the Intel Core 13th/14th Gen CPUs and the ~400 benchmark results makes this a home run for AMD on the desktop side with only some minor Linux caveats.",

Here’s how to defeat Cliff in Pokémon  Go in August 2024. \n\n\nHow to defeat Cliff in Pokémon GO \n\n\nCliff is essentially a slab of muscle, and so are his Pokémon with their high defense. But don’t think you won’t need a strategy to bring him down. To find Cliff in Pokémon Go, you must use a Rocket Radar to narrow down his location. Defeat Team Rocket Grunts, who will be marked with a TR balloon, and collect six Mysterious Components for the device.  \n\n\nYou can then use the Rocket Radar to show Cliff's whereabouts on the map. Like other bosses, he can appear at PokéStops or Team Rocket balloons. Sometimes, you can run into other enemies while there, so Cliff isn't always guaranteed. \n\n\nAlthough Cliff's Pokémon lineup has…",

That served up the perfect opportunity for Annapurna Interactive to announce a November 19, 2024 release date for the Nintendo Switch version of Stray.\n\n\nThe BlueTwelve Studio-developed adventure first launched on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC via Steam on July 19, 2022, with Xbox One and Xbox Series versions following in August. Now it's almost Nintendo's turn, and you can see a purrfect snapshot of what the game has to offer on Switch below.\n\n\n\n\nFor those who haven't checked it out yet, Stray makes for a unique little sci-fi journey, putting you in control of a brave little cat. With the help of a flying drone called B12, you're tasked with escaping a neon-tinged cybercity full of threats and on the verge of decay. \n\n\nStray has picked up positive reviews and accolades since launch, including awards for Best Independent Game and Best Debut Indie Game at the 2022 Game Awards. While it didn't win, it was also up for Game of the Year at the same event. It was nominated for multiple BAFTA awards in 2023, as well, and took home a pair of wins at the 2023 NAVGTR (National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers) Awards. \n\n\nWe got our first look at the Switch version of Stray during the June 2024 Nintendo Direct. As far as ports go, other than being on a less powerful platform it doesn't seem as if there are any additional bells and whistles of note. On the other hand, much like those who have it on their Steam Deck, you'll now be able to explore the dystopian adventure on the go. That's precisely how a cat would prefer to play. \n\nThe post Stray celebrates International Cat Day with Switch release date appeared first on Destructoid.",

If you’re wanting to befriend or even woo a villager, it’s a good idea to stock up on their loved gifts. \n\n\nOne of these items is the Shadow Flower. It’s not immediately obvious where this can be found, but it’s easy to find when you know where to look and if you’ve got luck on your side.\n\n\nWarning: This article contains spoilers for events which occur after progressing a fair way through the Mines (below level 19), so if you’re trying to avoid these, I’d suggest not reading what Shadow Flowers are used for. \n\n\nHow to find a Shadow Flower in Fields of Mistria\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nTo find a Shadow Flower in Fields of Mistria, you’ll need to go diving into the Mines. Specifically, you’ll need to work through the first 20 floors, as it doesn’t seem to spawn in any of the lower floors, although this is yet to be verified as I continue working my way down. \n\n\nShadow Flowers are purple in color and can spawn in any part of the Mines where there aren’t any rocks or other items. You may not come across them very often (this is where the luck I mentioned comes in), but you should make sure to pick them up and store them away when you find them. \n\n\nWhat to do with a Shadow Flower in Fields of Mistria\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nWhile diving through the Mines, you’ll encounter a new character — the Priestess. You’ll only meet her on floors 20, 40, 60 and so on, but she becomes a pretty big part of the story as you progress through the Mines. \n\n\nEventually, you’ll be able to give her gifts and Shadow Flowers are among the easiest items that she loves receiving as a gift.\n\nThe post How to get a Shadow Flower in Fields of Mistria appeared first on Destructoid.",

Each season also typically starts around 10 AM PST / 1 PM EST on the day of.\n\n\nWith each season also comes a new type of mechanic that fits the theme. For example, the Season of the Construct brought the Seneschal companion that had its own set of abilities to acquire and upgrade. There were also specific dungeons that went with it.\n\n\nWhat we can expect in the future beyond Season 6 is yet to be known, but what we do know is that there will be new cosmetics like mounts, armor sets, and portals. We’ll also probably see new limited-time mechanics or Aspects that change up the meta for the run of the season.\n\nThe post All Diablo 4 season start and end dates appeared first on Destructoid.",
