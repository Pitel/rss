          "description": "Pixel punishment.\nIn anime, there is a popular genre called isekai, which means “another world” and is characterised by the protagonist travelling from their normal, boring world into one filled with magic and monsters. Normally, it is a light-hearted affair, with the main character settling into their new life and eventually managing to save their new home while also falling in love with one or more well-endowed ladies. Lost Ruins shows a more brutal side of the isekai formula, sending a young woman into a dark and dangerous castle and tasking her with surviving.\nDeveloped by Altari Games, Lost Ruins is a survival-focused Metroidvania in which the player controls a young woman who has been summoned to a dungeon with no memories of who she is, even forgetting her own name. She is told by the suspiciously helpful mage Beatrice that she has been summoned to the castle to defeat the Dark Lady that has been sealed away in the castle. According to Beatrice, defeating the monsters that guard the Dark Lady is the key to restoring the Heroine’s memories.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Japanese studio Grezzo, known for their remakes of Majora's Mask, Ocarina of Time, and Link's Awakening, are working on something new and very secretive — the only information we currently have is that it's \"medieval\" and \"stylish\", which doesn't give us much to go on.\nIt seems like they updated their careers site in April, though, with two new roles: A \"battle planner\" and a designer. From these two job descriptions, we can find out a little bit more about the game (note: translations are from Google Translate, so take them with a pinch of salt):\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Some of it is great even, but I’ve jumped between loving and hating so many different bits over my last week with the PC beta that ultimately I’m just sad.

          "description": "Summer Game Fest organiser Geoff Keighley has advised people tuning in to this Thursday’s showcase not to expect any “megaton shock” game announcements. The stunning revelation that maybe you shouldn’t expect too many brand-new AAA game reveals following a global pandemic came through an audio broadcast on Twitter Spaces over the weekend, transcribed by VGC. “We’ve got lots of good stuff to show you,” Keighley said, “but buyer beware of some of the crazy rumours I’m seeing out there in terms of things people expect to get announced.”\nRead more",

Manic in the traditional ‘busy’ sense (hello Elden Ring, PAX, V Rising and now notE3 planning), but also in the ‘man, there are so many cool things I want to talk to you about but aren’t quite ready to announce yet’ sense. I’ve been on the cusp of writing about these things every single month since, err, March, but then something falls through, the weeks go by, and we’re back to square one again. So I’m sorry about that, I really am. \nWhat I’m writing to you about today still isn’t one of those exciting things, unfortunately, but it is nonetheless very important. When we relaunched our RPS Supporter Programme last year, we did so on June 17th, which means its one-year anniversary is just around the corner. It also means that those of you who signed up for our yearly supporter tier will be coming to the end of your subscription soon, and I wanted to explain a little bit about the renewal process as it’s… err, a bit convoluted. Sorry again about that.\nRead more",

So, it came as no surprise when I found myself testing out the closed alpha of yet another of their ilk: Ripout, an upcoming sci-fi horror FPS that's very Doom 3.\nWhat's nice is that vidbud Liam joined me! Both because he's a fan of the FPS genre and to be present with a jar in hand, lest I crumbled into dust. Thankfully this didn't happen and we had a pretty swell time, I'd say.

          "description": "Xalavier Nelson Jr has a bit of a love hate relationship with screens right now. As development on his studio’s gutsy market game Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator was wrapping up at the end of last year, he tells me he remembers “just being really angry at the concept of the borders of the screen”. He was, by his own admission, in “a vague fugue state” at the time, having spent months immersed in Space Warlord’s black and green trading interfaces. But the feeling of having his game “chained to these walls” at the edge of his monitor proved to be a surprisingly powerful one - so much so that it spurred Nelson Jr and his team at Strange Scaffold to create an entirely new kind of game in the months leading up to Warlord’s release: Witch Strandings.\r\n\nThat's right. Taking cues from Hideo Kojima’s hiking postal sim Death Stranding, Witch Strandings is a game that not only asks what Sam Bridges’ cross-country cargo routes might look like if they were made with a fraction of Kojima’s development budget, but also how games can create experiences that are “larger than my screen,” says Nelson Jr. And the answer, it turns out, lies in your PC’s humble mouse.\nRead more",

By their powers combined we manage to create an absolutely nightmarish dystopian society where people live forever but cannot put more than four of the same thing in a line. It's bleak. Games should stay in games.\nMatthew continues the Wolfe Carlton saga, Nate is making a crayfish into a mini-model, and I have a cold. A regular cold! No funny business. Matthew also does a very hard Cavern Of Lies this week that honestly nearly has us.\nRead more",

It turns out that, not only are there a lot of locations in Elden Ring, but the definition of a distinct location is largely up for debate. The opening area of Limgrave, for example, could be as many as four separate regions (East Limgrave, West Limgrave, Stormhill and Weeping Peninsula) depending on how you interpret it. That's not to mention all of the dungeons, caves, chapels, and other landmarks scattered throughout the Lands Between.\nYet like a newly minted Wretch squaring up to Margit the Fell Omen for the first time, I am prepared to plough on despite the pain that awaits. Below you'll find a comprehensive ranking of Elden Ring's major regions and legacy dungeons, based on the admittedly woolly criteria of how fun and interesting each location is to explore. So grab your map, put on your boots, and update your life insurance policy as we embark upon a grand tour of From Software's magnificent fantasy realm.\nRead more",

It’s the Porsche Design AOC Agon Pro PD32M, a premium 4K / 144Hz beast of a display, and is in fact the second hardware collaboration between these unlikely bedfellows.\r\n\n\r\nIt’s also far more ambitious (and expensive) than 2020's AOC Agon PD27. It’s flat rather than curved, but goes for both a higher resolution and a larger 31.5in IPS panel. Its DisplayHDR certification also rises from 400 to 1400, fuelled largely by a switch to more advanced Mini LED backlighting: the same sort as the Asus ROG Swift PG32UQX, one of the best 4K gaming monitors. As a gaming screen, then, it’s got all the right tools, but what exactly about it is Porsche-like?\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's already much more polished than the demo, with more yet to come. It's a life sim with a bit of a Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing vibe, except instead of farming you are a witch called Ellie (size: small) living in a biome (type: forest).\nIn the story you start to free the nearby village from cursed vines, and this requires that you catalogue and collect ingredients for spells, and thence expand your repertoire of witchy recipes. At the same time you can trade spells and magical candy with locals for currency, which you can use to improve your little machines - a roaster, a caldron, a press for ingredients - to make even better things, more efficiently. It's a satisfying process of mastery and exploration. But that is not the important bit. The important bit is that Little Witch In The Woods is disgustingly adorable.\nRead more",

We got nothing on Intel’s Arc graphics cards, and Nvidia’s keynote revealed some new DLSS games but otherwise went light on GeForce deets.\r\n\n\r\nThat said, this year’s show wasn’t a bust either: there was fresh AMD Ryzen 7000 info, Corsair’s first crack at a gaming laptop and, at long last, some PCIe 5.0 SSDs you can actually buy. One day. In the future. That’s in addition to the wackier, moon-shooting tech on display, without which it just wouldn’t be Computex.

In a community post, AMD asserted this particular Preview Driver could provide double-digit percentage gains in games running DirectX 11; claims that were backed up by early independent testing, like the creator of benchmarking tool CapFrameX getting an extra 24% out of Crysis Remastered.\r\n\n\r\nThis week, AMD Software Adrenaline Edition 22.5.2 released, making that new Radeon driver available to anyone who didn’t fancy switching to preview builds. Armed with an RX 6500 XT (a low-end card that desperately needs a performance kick), I gave the new software a whirl – and found that, for all those big numbers, Radeon owners should probably lower their expectations.\r\n\n \nRead more",

When you snap shut a piece of fiction you’ve been reading for days, or months even, it can be difficult severing those relationships you’ve built with its characters. Unless there’s a direct sequel, you must pull your pants up and shelve those emotions and move on.\nNot that I struggle with letting go of characters and stories particularly, but my brain makes an exception for the Yakuza games. More specifically, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio's games. I’ve reached a point where I’m ordering Lost Judgment with no intention of playing it for months - maybe even a year? It’s all a ploy to hang onto RGG’s characters and worlds for as long as I can; a sort of buffer to keep the unease at bay. Having nowhere to turn to next isn’t an option.\nRead more",

Try spelling \"jurassic\" properly first time; I've never been able too. \nDiversions this week are discussing classic UK subterranean tourist attractions Wookey Hole and Cheddar Gorge, and how Matthew's life could have been different if only he'd been Wookey Hole's witch mascot. Nate has bought a model kit for one of those massive excavation machines, which he says is \"about as big as an Alsatian\" and \"basically a bin-bag full of girders\".

Heck, Scream 5 even opens with a joke about how kids today only like 'prestige' horror like The Babadook.\nI'm convinced that there's a middle ground, where you can have a slasher horror that loves the tropes and knows how to work them, but still feels smart and fresh in 2022.

          "description": "Meet Apollo, the god of music\nHades is one of my favorite games of all time. It was my go-to game at the start of the pandemic, and after all was said and done I think I put close to 400 hours into that bad boy. I have played and replayed Hades to death, so anything new to help switch it up is a welcome change. Enter Apollo — the Greek god of music who was left off of the game's original lineup, but has since been added to the game by way of a mod thanks to AlexKage's project, OlympusExtra, which was originally spotted by ResetEra.\nThe mod adds Apollo to the game as if he were just like any of the other gods, including Boons (solo and duo), a Keepsake, a Wrath (you know, the environmental attack the gods spring on you when you're in a two-Boon chamber), and of course, plenty of dialogue. An artist named Reikiix did Apollo's portrait, which honestly looks so good you can't tell that it wasn't part of the base game.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbeHCKiDB7M\nApollo's specialty is a blinding effect, which makes enemies more likely to miss their attacks. I can imagine that would go really well with Aphrodite or Athena's Boons if you want to go for a low-damage or even no-hit run. There are already some videos out there of modders playing with the Apollo mod, so those might be worth checking out if you want to see what he can do to help Zagreus escape the Underworld.\nOlympusExtra is still in its early stages — not only will Apollo's inclusion of the game be more built out in the future with some more voice lines and duo Boons on the way, but other gods will also be added to the mix, including Hera, Hestia, and Hephaestus. Hades has fostered a huge cult following since its release in 2020, and it's great to see the modding community getting in on the action.\nThe post This Hades mod adds Apollo to the game’s roster of gods appeared first on Destructoid.",

This neat bonus is, of course, a throwback to the release of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2: The Arcade Game on NES, which also included a free pizza with each purchase!\nhttps://twitter.com/LimitedRunGames/status/1533910176637517827?s=20&t=1OyPR7h4FbGbLewoOupIfg\nIt seems like Limited Run really had to pull some strings and do some serious organizing in order to get the pizza tie-in promotion on board, and as such, the offer is only redeemable at North American outlets and is tied exclusively to the Limited Run edition of TMNT: Shredder's Revenge. Still, it's a very cute, unique, and nostalgic freebie, especially for those who can actually eat pizza, unlike your feather-stomached boy Moyse. Regardless, pre-orders are now live on the Limited Run Games store.\nWhile no images were shown, Limited Run also has a full Collector's Edition of the cartoon brawler in the works, which will include all of the above gubbins along with a Playmates figure of Shredder himself, replicated from the megaselling 1990s toy line. More details on this edition will be revealed in the near future.\nTMNT: Shredder's Revenge launches 2022 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Limited Run Games’ TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge comes with a free pizza appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Something to look forward to\nE3 was already struggling before the pandemic hit, so its gradual departure over the past few years seemed to be a long time coming. While it may not have taken anyone by surprise, it was still pretty sad to see an event that had become such a staple of the gaming industry close its doors indefinitely. We've had plenty of other news streams to keep us busy, but it just hasn't quite been the same. So naturally, we're pretty excited to hear from the Entertainment Software Association (the organization that runs E3) that the event will be back fully in person in 2023 after three years, as they told The Washington Post.\nAs ESA president and CEO Stan Pierre-Louis told the site: \"We’re excited about coming back in 2023 with both a digital and an in-person event. As much as we love these digital events, and as much as they reach people and we want that global reach, we also know that there’s a really strong desire for people to convene—to be able to connect in person and see each other and talk about what makes games great.\"\n\nE3 had already been in a transition period before the pandemic hit — the event had been struggling with attendance and its own identity for years. They were making big changes, like allowing fans to attend what was previously a trade-only event in 2015, but even that wasn't enough to keep them afloat with many of the large companies opting for their own solo press conferences.\nWhile it can be a lot of fun to have one huge event to look forward to every year, some have considered the benefits of sunsetting E3 for good, like more games being able to stand out when the press is paced more evenly throughout the year, rather than being dumped on us all at once.\nAs an LA local, I'd love to be able to go in person again for E3 2023, but I know for others it's not that simple. I guess now it's just a waiting game to see if the ESA actually pulls through on this one.\nThe post The ESA says that E3 will definitely be back in person next year appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Super Crash Bros.\nIn the week of summer streamin', one can always expect a flurry of leaks and rumors, and 2022 is no exception. Regarding everyone's favorite crate-smashing psycho, Crash Bandicoot, the word on the street is that publisher Activision and developer Toys for Bob are preparing to reveal a brand new brawler/platform fighter starring Crash and The Boys... umm...\nThe rumor was sparked by Window Central writer (and known spoiler) Jez Corden, speaking on a new episode of the Windows Central Gaming Podcast. According to Corden, Toys for Bob is beavering away at the new title, which is expected to be a chaotic platform fighter in the style of games such as MultiVersus, Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, and, of course, Nintendo's Super Smash Bros. While the conversation on the podcast was a little spirited and jokey, there was a clear inference that the title could be revealed during this week's run of \"non-E3\" live streams.\nCrash Bandicoot, as a franchise, has certainly gotten to the point where it has enough beloved characters to launch its own fighting game. And given that it has already run the gamut of kart racers, puzzle titles, and mobile spin-offs, it seems that stepping it the ring is one of the few genres left for Crash, Coco, Cortex, and co. are left to conquer. I have already decided that Ripper Roo is my main, and we don't even know if he is in the Crash Bandicoot brawler... or even if there is a Crash Bandicoot brawler! I guess we'll just have to keep 'em peeled as the week progresses.\nYou can check out the full episode of the Windows Central Gaming Podcast below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwpO_G7OYW8\nThe post Rumor: Smash Bros.-like Crash Bandicoot brawler in the works appeared first on Destructoid.",

Nintendo Switch Online Zelda rewards are now live, and you can grab them until July 4 at 6PM PT, when they'll be cycled out for something else.\nThe Switch Online Zelda icons include several Link poses (of course), as well as a smiling Daruk, a Guardian about to destroy someone, Purah, the Zelda logo, and a piece of raw prime meat. Nintendo is putting out the first \"wave\" through June 13 at 5:59PM PT. After that we'll get several more ways until we hit that July 4 marker, and Breath of the Wild rotates out. So if you don't find a style you like this week, wait until the next wave! Also, if you're interested, you can find the June Animal Crossing villager birthday icons below.\nNeed points for the Switch Online Zelda icons? As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.\nhttps://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1533980822105206785\nThe post PSA: Grab these Switch Online Zelda: Breath of the Wild rewards through July 4 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Season 1 kicks off in Battlefield 2042 on June 9\nMore tools for mayhem are arriving on the battlefield. Electronic Arts and DICE debuted a trailer today, showing what's coming in Battlefield 2042 Season 1 on June 9, 2022.\nIn today's trailer, the team gives us a good look at Exposure, the new map arriving in Season 1. It's set in the Canadian Rockies and looks to make big use of verticality, allowing aircraft and wingsuits to really get around.\nAlso shown is the new Specialist, Ewelina Lis. Lis is particularly skilled at tackling vehicles, using a remote-controlled rocket launcher to wreak havoc on armor.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Hfeb7eIzbo\nAlongside those, new vehicles and weapons are also coming in Battlefield 2042 Season 1. Two new gunships, the RAH-68 Huron and YG-99 Hannibal, take to the skies. The BSV-M Marksman Rifle offers a new mid-range option. And the Smoke Grenade launcher offers some infantry ground cover.\nBut good lord, the Ghostmaker R10 Crossbow looks like a blast. Literally, because it has explosive ammo, alongside regular, light, and heavy ammo. The core content additions are available as part of the free Battle Pass track, though it will require playing to unlock. Additional cosmetics are in the Premium Battle Pass Track.\nSeasoned veterans\nThere are also more fixes for stability, balance, gunplay, performance, and more. It looks like DICE is trying to make good on its commitment to improving Battlefield 2042 after its rough launch.\nThe focus comes at the cost of some initial pillars, like the removal of the 128-player Breakthrough variant. The team also shuttered all future content development for Hazard Zone, its Tarkov-style multiplayer mode, in favor of focusing on its other pillars.\nWith Season 1 for Battlefield 2042 finally going live, it seems like this could be the time for DICE to rally and try to right the ship. Exploding crossbow bolts are a good start, at least.\nThe post Battlefield 2042 shows new map, Specialist, and more arriving in Season 1 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Note that this is for iOS 16, which is currently being tested by developers (and intrepid folks who simply sign up for it); and is scheduled to arrive in the fall of this year. In case you're keeping track, iOS now supports PS5 DualSense, Xbox Series X, and Joy-Con controllers once this update is pushed.\nThe news broke by way of Riley Testut, an iOS developer, who noted that the Switch Pro Controller and single J0y-Con will work natively in iOS: showing up in the Bluetooth section as the properly named devices. Interestingly, pairing both the left (L) and right (R) Joy-Con will also allow the devices to work in tandem as a single device. As Testut points out, you can use a simple command (hold screenshot + home) to swap between single Joy-Con and multi-Joy-Con modes at will. When pairing, just make sure you hold the pairing button on each Joy-Con.\nIt really is a comprehensive iOS Switch facelift, as you can technically play a ton of games that are found on the Switch eShop and also on iOS with the same control method.

In the preview, we see the old dawg utilizing his meaty-looking sidearms at both long and short distances, while also laying several traps in order to control space. Troubleshooter looks to be a somewhat complex character, but one that can easily control their opponent's space, shutting down options and presenting risk from all angles.\nHe's also handsome as all hell, teasing the viewer with roses and sweet nothings. DNF Duel may be the horniest fighter to come down the line in some time, frankly. You'll be able to join the love-in very soon, as DNF Duel will finally launch on PlayStation and PC platforms June 28.

The early looks at open-world exploration, puzzle-solving, and combat have been getting some mixed reception though. Sega has said Sonic Frontiers is arriving in 2022.\nThere's also the retro collection Sonic Origins. This packages in a bunch of Sonic the Hedgehog classics, including Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and Sonic & Knuckles. We got a glimpse at the Mirror Mode option recently, which looks wild. We already know the release date for Sonic Origins though, and it's not far off. The retro collection is aiming for June 23, 2022.\nAs for expanded content, there is a third Sonic the Hedgehog movie in the works. Knuckles is getting his own live-action series as well, and the Sonic Prime series on Netflix. Sonic media is growing to encompass a lot, and we could get hints about what's in store along those lines.\nThe Sonic Central does arrive right at the vanguard of a stacked week for streams too. Thursday is the Summer Game Fest Live kickoff, followed by several days of streams including Xbox, the Wholesome Direct, and the PC Gaming Show.

          "description": "Running Up That Hill\nFor those of you still exploring the luscious-but-deadly pastures of Horizon Forbidden West, Guerrilla Games has a brand new update for you. As revealed during last week's Sony State of Play presentation, Update 1.14 brings new several new features and modes to the stunning open-world adventure.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3worI7QeCHQ\nFirst and perhaps foremost, Horizon Forbidden West update 1.14 adds the much-requested New Game+ mode for those who have already completed Aloy's adventure. These players can now restart the story, locked and loaded with gear, skills, and abilities for a low-intensity run through the epic campaign. For those who wish to press themselves further forward, the new Ultra Hard difficulty option will test your hunting and acrobatic skills to the absolute limit.\nFor players who feel they may have perhaps focused Aloy's growing talents in the wrong areas, the new Respec option will rebank all of your acquired skill points, allowing for a fresh build on Aloy's skill tree. And for the fashion-forward, the new Transmog option will allow you to select any of your gathered gear (including all respective effects) while retaining the visual appearance of any other outfit. So if you have a favorite look for yer girl, then you can keep on rocking that visual style regardless of your actual equipped clothing, armour, and headgear.\nLast, but by no means least, the new update features a fresh round of bug stomps and visual tweaks, the details of which you can find in the official patch notes right here.\nHorizon Forbidden West is available now on PlayStation platforms.\nThe post Horizon Forbidden West update 1.14 adds New Game+ and more appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "No longer a silent brawl\nNickelodeon's cartoon mash-up brawler is getting a much-requested addition today. Full character voice-over for the whole roster hits Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl today alongside items in a free update for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.\nWhen Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl first launched, its lack of voice-over for its roster was notable. Today, GameMill Entertainment and Ludosity are updating the brawl to add exactly that.\nThe voices behind characters including SpongeBob (Tom Kenny) and Patrick (Bill Fagerbakke), Ren & Stimpy (Billy West), Garfield (Frank Welker), and Korra (Janet Varney) will be included in this new update. So now, it won't be so ominously quiet as SpongeBob and Korra duke it out in the arena.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIuGYhVDAis\nThe other major addition in today's free update to Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is items. The cartoon brawler launched without any pick-up-and-use items. Now, items like Sokka's boomerang, a Krabby Patty, and a Reptar toy will be optional drops.\nAre you ready?\nThe lack of both voice-over work and items were big detractors from Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, so it's good to see both finally being added. The update is rolling out now for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. Nintendo Switch owners will get it \"soon,\" according to GameMill.\nMaybe with this addition, the brawls will have a little more life to them. Games like Super Smash Bros. might have developed prominent competitive scenes, but a lot of the charm in those platform fighters also comes from the characters themselves. Captain Falcon is visually recognizable, but so is his declaration of \"FALCON PUNCH.\"\nThe good news is, if you're now eager to try Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl after its addition of voices, it's easy to do so. The cartoon brawler is one of this month's PlayStation Plus games, so subscribers can pretty easily hop on and try out the update for themselves.\nThe post Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl gets full character voice-over in free update today appeared first on Destructoid.",

Wario tells the soothing grandpa-voiced narrator to \"shut up,\" and he just responds with \"take it easy, Wario.\" No exclamation point needed: it's that soothing.

          "description": "Economy crash puts paid to retro hardware rereleases\nAt the weekend, Sega Japan announced that it was releasing a new piece of portable hardware in the form of the Sega Mega Drive Mini II, a pint-sized edition of the 1993 console that will come pre-loaded with 50 Sega Mega Drive and Mega CD classics. Given that the Mega Drive Mini already exists, some fans might be puzzled as to why Sega has not instead focused on releasing a scaled-down model of its 1994 console, Sega Saturn, or its 1998 big brother, the Sega Dreamcast.\nSpeaking with Famitsu, Sega hardware producer Yosuke Okunari offered up the unfortunate news that a Sega Saturn Mini or a Sega Dreamcast Mini are both very unlikely to ever see the light of day. Okunari understands that the audience is there for such consoles, but states that a combination of expensive components, further hampered by the COVID-19 pandemic's effect on manufacturing costs, has simply made the project uneconomical from both a production and finance perspective.\nOkunari also suggested that the components used by Sega's Mini consoles are not quite up-to-spec in regards to running Sega Saturn titles — a console that is notoriously difficult to authentically emulate. Okunari jokes that the process of producing a Sega Saturn Mini in 2022 might see it launch with a price rivaling that of modern-day consoles. So it seems, for now at the very least, the Mega CD is as far as we are going in regards to the Sega Mini range.\nThe Sega Mega Drive Mini 2 launches in Japan October 27, priced at ¥9,980 (roughly $75 USD). Sega is yet to confirm whether this edition will also be released in the west. For more details on the console, check out @gosokkyu's Twitter thread translating/paraphrasing the Famitsu interview.\nSega producer says high costs are preventing a Dreamcast or Saturn mini [VGC]\nThe post Sega says don’t hold your breath for a Saturn or Dreamcast Mini appeared first on Destructoid.",

That changes today with a blog post detailing the history of Bend Studio and giving a tiny hint at what the team is up to with its next project.\nThe post details the games Bend had developed in its nearly 30-year history, from the first days of the studio when it was known as Blank, Berlyn and Co., through the time it was known as Eidetic when it developed Bubsy 3D, the Syphon Filter series, and beyond. There's a lot of great history about the studio packed in there alongside concept art and more. But, what comes next for Bend Studio is a break from any series or franchise it's worked on or created before. \n\"We are currently working on a new IP that includes multiplayer and builds upon the open-world systems of Days Gone, but brings you a whole new world that we are extremely excited to craft for you. We cannot wait to reveal it to you when the time is right,\" writes Kevin McAllister from Bend Studio.\nThis is the second time Bend has mentioned its new project, with the first word coming from a tweet last year. While the next game from the studio won't be Days Gone 2, nor a return to Syphon Filter, it at least looks to be learning and building from those prior works. Additionally, whether this new IP will be part of Sony's new initiative to develop more live service games remains to be seen.\nBend Studio also took the opportunity to debut a new logo in the blog post, which you can see above. The logo treatment is a nice change in design from the previous iterations since it's now modular and can be fitted into different aesthetics for various occasions.\nFor more on Bend Studio's former projects or what never came to be, check out what the studio pitched for a sequel to Days Gone that never saw the light of day.",

But with clever implementation of said metal music, Metal Hellsinger looks to transcend the spiritual successor label to become something else entirely.\nBy combining that fast-paced, frenetic first-person shooting action with rhythm-based mechanics that reward you for shooting in sync with the music, Metal Hellsinger delivers a wholly unique experience. While the gameplay conventions help separate the game from the pack, it's perhaps the original soundtrack that is most eye-catching. As you slay your way through the demons of Metal Hellsinger, you do it to original recordings by some…",

          "description": "A massive 1.0 update for Battlefield 2042 is out now on all platforms, and it brings hundreds of changes, bug fixes, and quality of life improvements to the online shooter ahead of its Season 1 launch. \nAnd speaking of Season 1: Zero Hour, DICE will reveal gameplay today at 8 a.m. PT/11 a.m. ET on its official Battlefield 2042 YouTube channel, as reported by VG247. There, you’ll see a glimpse of these changes and improvements and a look at what the first season of Battlefield 2042 looks like. As for the update, here’s what Dice has highlighted: \nMultiple improvements to soldier gameplay which will result in overall smoother animations and movement.\nWeapons received updated netcode to improve bullet hit registration. We’ve also done a further balance pass which includes increased projectile speeds for DMR’s and LMG’s, and improved accuracy for Shotguns.\nMultiple new XP events have been added, such as for killing an enemy who recently wounded or killed a squadmate, or when an enemy vehicle you recently damaged is destroyed by a teammate and the occupants are killed\nThe number of available in-world vehicles has been increased for Conquest which should make it easier to move across the map\nSundance’s Wingsuit has been adjusted to lower overall flight time, while making it easier to maneuver. To simplify their Specialty, the EMP Field Smart Explosive has been removed\nDice is scheduling the next update for early July, but it’s “a smaller update that brings further fixes and changes to the battlefield.” Head to Dice’s full patch notes list for the complete list of changes, bug fixes, and improvements. \nWhile waiting for today’s Season 1 debut, read Game Informer’s Battlefield 2042 review and read about how the next Battlefield has entered pre-production with “valuable lessons” learned from Battlefield 2042. Check out Dice’s response to Battlefield 2042 map complaints and feedback afterward. \n[Source: VG247]\nAre you excited for Season 1 of Battlefield 2042? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "Madden NFL 23 is coming in August with some new tech set to change the game entirely on both sides of the ball. Our own Brian Shea recently went hands-on with the latest version of Madden and its game-changing feature FieldSense, which encompasses a variety of changes to gameplay and animations. You can check out a deep dive into everything FieldSense offers in the video above.\nFieldSense, which is exclusive to the newest generation of consoles (PS5 and Xbox Series X/S), has a few different aspects that are covered in the video by senior game design director for Madden NFL 23, Connor Dougan. First is a set of new physics-informed animation as well as animation branching technology that brings a more realistic look to the action on the field. New gameplay techniques like 360 Cuts introduce more control for receivers and running backs, while Hit Everything is a feature that affects just about everything on the defensive side of the ball. For Quarterbacks, Skill Based Passing will let players fine-tune where they're throwing the ball for more precise passes that can be kept away from pass defenders. There are demonstrations of those new concepts and more in the almost five-minute breakdown.\nMadden NFL 23 lands on August 19 this year with the man himself, John Madden, gracing the cover. While FieldSense is only available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, other versions of the game are also coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

          "description": "Back at E3 2021, we learned that Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties, one of the strangest FMV games of the ’90s, was getting remastered for modern consoles courtesy of Limited Run Games. Now we know that John, Jane, and Thresher will return later this year. \nThe news comes by way of today's Limited Run Presents showcase. What the heck is Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties, you ask? The 1993 game is best described as an interactive romantic comedy firmly aimed at adults, thanks to its mild nudity and sexual innuendo. Players guide a plumber named John, who tries to win the heart of a beautiful woman named Jane in an adventure laden with ridiculous hijinks. That includes dealing with an unreliable narrator and confronting a, shall we say, creepy boss. The gameplay involves making simple decisions in a choose-your-own-adventure format and watching live-action cutscenes. \nTo editorialize a bit, Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties is absurd and pretty bad. However, as footage of the game found its way on YouTube over the years, the game has found new life as a cult favorite “so bad it’s good” oddity, not unlike Night Trap (which got a similar remaster a few years ago). Since Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties had a limited release on PC and the poor-selling 3DO console, not many folks have been able to play it themselves. \nThe Definitive Edition polishes up the adventure with 4K visuals and adds features such as deleted scenes, a progress chart, and new video interviews with the cast. \nPlumbers Don’t Wear Ties: Definitive Edition launches later this year for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. It will be available both digitally and in physical form, thanks to Limited Run Games. If you’re into FMV games, check out this deep-dive feature about the history of the genre.",

While we await more details on some of those features, Capcom has divulged some info on Ryu's new look and the game's place in the Street Fighter timeline.\nThe game's official Twitter account shared a statement by director Takayuki Nakayama that confirms Street Fighter 6 takes place after the events of Street Fighter III. This places the game at the end of the series' timeline given that Street Fighter V is set before SF 3. \nAs for Ryu's new look, Nakayama explains his Buddhist robe, also called a kasaya, showcases Ryu's newfound dignity despite the warrior feeling he's \"not there yet.\" What that means is up to interpretation, but the attire does pair well with Ryu's dashing beard if nothing else. \n\"Although Street Fighter 6 occurs after the Street Fighter III series, Ryu still feels that he's \"not there yet\" - though he seems to have gained some dignity. The way he wears the kasaya (Buddhist robe) is reminiscent of his master, Goken.\"\n@takaNakayama pic.twitter.com/yFdzRHsPVp\nJune 6, 2022\nStreet Fighter 6 launches sometime in 2023 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC.",

As stated before, items are also joining the game, but there's almost no detail on what those items may be or what they do in battle. We'll just have to play to find out.\nThe new Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl patch hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC today, with the Switch update coming later. PlayStation Plus members can claim a free copy of Nick Brawl until the end of June as part of the PS+ monthly game offerings alongside God of War and Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker.",

          "description": "Last weekend's Pokémon Go Fest delivered two days of catching fun, along with the debuts of Nihilego and Shaymin within the mobile game. Now, Pokémon Go and the Pokémon Trading Card Game are crossing over with events that will touch both games. For Pokémon Go, the event begins on June 16 and brings the chance to catch Wimpod and a new version of Pikachu wearing a TCG hat.\nFor the Pokémon Trading Card Game, the next expansion is themed around Pokémon Go, and will feature cards based on Team Mystic, Instinct, and Valor. We'll have to wait to see just how many of the cards are true crossovers, but no matter what, it's great seeing these two popular games work together.\nFor the mobile trainers out there, Wimpod is one of those Pokémon that requires 400 candies to evolve. When this number is hit, Wimpod evolves into Golisopod. The creature that looks a bit like a dead fish transforms into one of the coolest Godzilla-like beasts in all of Pokémon.\nThis event also sees Mewtwo returning to five-star raids. All Mewtwo caught from June 16 to June 23 will have the Shadow Ball charged attack. Those caught from June 23 to July 1 will have the Psystrike charged attack.\nIf you use the Mystery Box during the event, you'll have the chance to catch a Shiny Meltan. The Mystery Box is only obtained by sending a Pokémon to Pokémon Home or Pokémon: Let’s Go, Pikachu! or Pokémon: Let’s Go, Eevee! It's a bit of a hassle to get the Box, but it's well worth it, as Meltan is great for battling.",

If you watch the show and find yourself clamoring for more information, Microsoft has announced an extended version of the presentation a couple of days later.\nOn June 14, the Xbox Games Showcase Extended airs at 10 a.m. Pacific/1 p.m. Eastern. This supplemental event features 90 minutes of new trailers, interviews, and in-depth looks at the titles shown during the Xbox & Bethesda livestream. Xbox Wire describes the presentation as “all-new,” suggesting it may be more substantial than just a rehash of the June 12 event with a few extra tidbits.   \nWe don’t know what the Xbox & Bethesda showcase has in store, but appearances from Starfield, Forza Motorsport 8, and Redfall seem like solid guesses. You can listen to some of our Game Informer editors pit their predictions against each other in this episode of the Game Informer Show. \nTo learn more about what’s happening and when during Summer Game Fest, keep an eye on our evolving showcase streaming schedule.",

          "description": "After a night of being offline following the Collision event, Fortnite is back, once again shaking up the norm with new biomes to explore, skins to unlock, and gameplay techniques to master. In the final moments of last night's event, we saw Obi-Wan Kenobi locked in combat with Darth Vader. The feared Sith Lord is one of the new skins that is unlockable when you purchase this season's battle pass. At a later date in the battle pass bonus tier, archaeologist Indiana Jones will join the fight.\nFortnite Chapter 3, Season 3 is officially called Vibin', and true to form, it brings a colorful, party atmosphere to its new story thread and areas of the map. On the eastern coast, you'll see two new areas to explore: Rave Cave and Reality Falls. These Biomes feature giant mushrooms to bound across, as well as waterfalls and strange trees to interact with.\nThe tallest tree is called the Reality Tree and it's in full bloom, spreading Reality Seed Pods across the island. If you grab a seed and plant it, a Reality Sapling will grow. If you weed it, you'll be rewarded loot. The more times a sapling is uprooted, the better the loot. Yes, you can get Mythic weapons this way.\nOn the gameplay front, you can now use animals as mounts. If you see a wolf or boar, see if you can catch a ride. Ballers are also back thanks to the reappearance of the Screwballer amusement park ride. The Ballers have more health than before, can float on water, and are battery-operated, meaning you know how long the ride will be.\nWe'll have to wait to see what other surprises and changes await us in Vibin', but it's off to a great start, and you gotta love seeing Indiana Jones and Darth Vader joining the character ranks.\nWhat did you think of the Collision event? And are you excited to jump into this new season? Let us know in the comments section below.",

To be a part of this festival, you need to buy the ticket in the in-game item shop for $14.99.\nAs we complete research challenges that lead to a mythical encounter with Shaymin, we'll want to be on the lookout for three Pokémon who are leaving their regions and will only be here for the two days. Those Pokémon are: Tropius, Torkoal, and Galarian Mr. Mime. We'll need to use incense to lure all of them out when they appear in their habitats.\nAs the Fest unfolds, each hour brings a different habitat with different Pokémon to catch. Many can be the rare shiny variant.

          "description": "Let's rock, baby! Season 6 of Video Gameography gets stylish as we examine the Devil May Cry series! Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise. This week we start from the beginning as we unpack one of the most influential action games ever, Devil May Cry.\nArriving stateside on October 16, 2001, the game stars Dante, a demon hunter (and half-demon himself) on a mission to stop underworld emperor Mundus from invading the human world. The game began life as Resident Evil 4, helmed by a hotshot young director named Hideki Kamiya who veered the game from survival horror to stylish action. While it proved too drastic of a departure for Resident Evil, Capcom knew they had something and reworked the project into its own franchise. Listen on to learn how Dante was conceived, our thoughts on the game’s story, and how we fared against the game’s legendarily brutal difficulty.\nJoin hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), along with MinnMax contributer and former Game Informer editor Joe Juba (@Joejuba) \nIf you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

Described by Amazon Games as an online multiplayer action-adventure with cooperative and competitive play, this new experience appears to be set in a post-apocalytpic or post-war world. This observation comes from two pieces of concept art that show crashed airplanes that appear to be heavily weathered.\nThe humans pictured in these artworks hold primitive weapons, such as a rifle with a bayonet. One of the characters appears to have mechanical legs. Several of these beings also wear headsets with tall antenna, likely for cooperative communication.\nIn a press release, Christoph Hartmann, the vice president of Amazon Games, says we can expect something different from this multiplayer experience. \"The talented team at Disruptive Games is creating a fresh take on the multiplayer action-adventure genre, with strong game design and rich world-building that we're excited to help bring to players.\" \nOn Disruptive's official website, this new IP is amusingly codenamed \"super secret project.\" We'll have to wait for more details, but the usage of concept art with game title implies it's a long way off.",

On June 4, players are invited to experience a timed event called \"Collision.\" This story-driven moment can only be played once and will kick off at 4 p.m. ET. Epic Games says the fate of the Zero point will be decided in this gameplay event, which I believe will lead into Chapter 3, Season 3.\nThe events in Fortnite are always fun, as they shake up the gameplay, change the environments, and introduce new characters to the battle royale universe. Collision hits just a week after Obi-Wan Kenobi is introduced. A mysterious tower has also appeared in the center of the island.\nEpic Games is encouraging streamers and players to record the event, as it won't be repeated. The last event brought us The Foundation (played by Dwayne Johnson) and Spider-Man. The island also flipped over and gave us an entirely new map to discover. What will happen this time? The teaser image above gives us a taste of a monstrous return.\nIf you have the Battle Pass, you have just one week to complete it and get Doctor Strange (and his alternate costumes in the bonus tier). Fly through the missions you can for big XP bumps.\nIf you log in at any point on June 4 after 8 a.m. ET, you'll receive an exclusive loading screen and lobby track for Collision. You'll be able to log into the Collision lobby 30 minutes before the event begins.\nWhat do you hope to see from Season 3? Any character skins you are hoping to see added or return?",

The Resident Evil 2 and 3 Remakes have been a perfect way to relive the glories of the past with contemporary improvements. But what comes next? Resident Evil 4 Remake is the answer, and we're pouring over every detail of the new trailer in today's spoiler-filled breakdown.\n\n\nAlex Stadnik is your host for the video and welcomes Resident Evil 4 superfan Blake Hester to dissect every nook and cranny of Capcom's surprise announcement from the latest Sony State of Play. As stated above, we go into a lot of spoilers of the original game, so if you haven't played it yet, please bookmark this video and come back.\nThe boys kick things off by discussing their levels of surprise when the fourth entry in the iconic series makes its first appearance. They then break the trailer down scene by scene, letting you know what they think will be different and what will stay the same. They also ponder if the remake will feature a character similar to Mr. X, Nemesis, or Lady D instead of creating a straight one-to-one recreation. Finally, they wrap by discussing whether or not the game will get delayed and what their levels of hype are after seeing Leon's return.\nAre you excited about Resident Evil 4? The wait isn't too long as Capcom's next remake is launching on March 24, 2023, for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC!

          "description": "Sega revealed a quick 30-second teaser of Sonic Frontiers gameplay earlier this week, and IGN released a full seven-minute look at the open-world gameplay of the Blue Blur’s latest. Now, you can watch more than six minutes of combat from the game, and it looks like Sonic combat…in a 3D open world. \nAs we previously saw, Sonic Frontiers’ world is beautiful and one of the most realistic-looking games in the franchise’s history. Today’s combat showcase takes place in the same area as the previous gameplay premiere but with decidedly less rail grinding and more spinball fighting action. As you might expect, Sonic fights in Sonic Frontiers like he always has – lots of jump attacks, spin moves, kicks, and more. However, it seems he does have a few new tricks up his sleeve. Namely, an in-air jolt attack that makes him dash all over the screen before doing an interesting rotating circle attack. Take a look for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Sonic is up against some new types of enemies in Sonic Frontiers, and they seem to tank a lot more damage than the Blue Blur is traditionally used to doling out. That doesn’t appear to be a problem for him, though, as he aptly takes them out with ease. We also get a look at Sonic confronting a massive creature-like machine that stands extremely tall toward the end of the video. Sonic uses some interesting moves to eventually defeat that, too. \nUnfortunately, we don’t yet have a release date for Sonic Frontiers, but it’s coming sometime this year, so hopefully, we don’t have to wait too much longer. In the meantime, check out this trailer from last December, and then check out this other snippet of Sonic Frontiers gameplay that debuted earlier this week. \nWhat do you think of the combat in Sonic Frontiers?

However, while Spider-Man Remastered will be released on PC this summer, the PlayStation blog says Miles Morales will “launch on PC in fall 2022,” so presumably later than August 12. \nOddly enough, PlayStation didn’t reveal Miles Morales was coming to PC during yesterday’s showcase, an odd exclusion for a segment of the show that was all about Spider-Man’s big PC release. Nonetheless, you can play through both of Insomniac’s Spider-Man games on PC later this year.  \nThe original story continues below...\nOriginal story, 6/2/22:\nHave you been wanting to web-sling as Spidey on your PC? You’re in luck! Today, at Sony’s State of Play, it was announced that Insomniac’s Spider-Man is coming to PC in its remastered form on August 12. Previously, you could only play the game on PS4 and PS5. \nThe remastered edition includes new assets, tech, and plenty of updates. In this edition, Peter Parker was recast to Ben Jordan to better match actor Yuri Lowenthal’s facial capture for PS5.\nThat’s right in just a few months, you’ll be able to experience the game that our own Andrew Reiner gave a 9.5, saying: “Like Batman: Arkham Asylum before it, Spider-Man raises the bar for one of the world’s most beloved heroes.” You can read his full review here.\nWant more? You can watch the reveal trailer above, which showcases the announcement and all the awesome action in store for Peter Parker.",

This game, which Square Enix’s Creative Business Unit III studio is developing, has admittedly been on my mind since Square Enix revealed it in 2020. However, it’s especially front and center today after the FF XVI trailer that aired during yesterday’s State of Play. \nThat trailer featured new looks at gameplay, more information about the warring kingdoms, including the Empire, surrounding the story, and the key figures at the heart of it all. Yesterday’s trailer highlighted these characters because they seem to have the ability to transform into completely, or at least embody, the primals or summons seen throughout the Final Fantasy franchise – primals and summons such as Ifrit, Bahamut, Odin, Shiva, and more. Following that trailer, Square Enix has uploaded some new screenshots of the beautiful landscapes in FF XVI we’ll be trekking across, and they look fantastic. Check them out for yourself below: \n\nAs you can see, they feature new looks at different parts of this world that we haven’t yet seen in trailers, which have focused more on the story and combat of the game than the actual setting.

The trailer, which dove deep into the story of FF XVI, focuses on the war that will soon be waged between warring kingdoms, with the Empire seemingly leading the charge. At the heart of this war are multiple key figures who appear to have the ability to transform into (or at least embody) primals, which have traditionally been summons in Final Fantasy games.\nCheck them out for yourself in the trailer below: \n\n\nHere are the primals/summons seen in the trailer: \nPhoenix\nTitan\nGaruda\nBamuh\nShiva\nOdin\nBahamut\nIfrit\nElsewhere in the trailer, we get new looks at the game's combat, which seems to contain some unique boss fights that will feature health bars on the top of the screen. The combat throughout the gameplay looks quite flashy, too, with plenty of spin attacks, fire, and more. At the bottom right is a weapon wheel of sorts that seems to be something players can customize, complete with items, a jump action, an attack action, and a slew of magic attacks to utilize.

Just a few months after its debut at The Game Awards, the title seemed to be stalled after several hostile workplace allegations. However, today's State of Play proved the game is still in development and aims to come out in Autumn. The unexpected release window is coming up quickly, but the gorgeous new trailer suggests Season: A Letter to the Future will be ready.\n\n\nSeason won't task you with fighting monsters or saving the world. Rather, the game puts the player in the shoes of a traveler named Estelle, who is recording everything around her for posterity. There are hints that Season's sweeping vistas, sun-drenched fields, and flowing waterfalls won't be around for future generations. The trailer explains that no one knows what will happen when \"the season\" ends, which makes the job of documenting the world for the future so important. We see the protagonist going about this assignment is various ways, like writing in a journal, taking photos, and recording audio. She also stops off to speak with the people around her while exploring the landscape on her bike.\nAs the narrative designer, Meg Hutchison explains:\nThe title looks like it is shaping up to be a pensive and beautiful experience when it comes out on PlayStation consoles and PC this fall.",

In it, independent developer Studio Sai invites you to find love in the most trying times – during an apocalypse.  \nThe game challenges you to make the most of life during this catastrophic situation. That means finding life and saving the world. When a mysterious entity infects humans and turns them into monsters, you must race against the clock to find an answer for survival, especially if you want to save your new relationship. In the game, you scavenge, dungeon crawl, and date your way to answers. But be aware that you're doing it all on a deadline, with a clock constantly ticking, reminding you to meet your deadlines.\nStudio Sai promises dungeons with traps and puzzles, alongside fun dancing minigames. You also get to pick from a cast of five characters for your romantic pursuits, each with their own unique stories and skills to help you battle. The action showcased in the trailer looked fast-paced and featured mostly hacking and slashing away at baddies while using the face buttons to unleash powerful skills and magical abilities. There was even a motorcycle sequence to get your adrenaline pumping.

The goal of each competitor is to achieve the highest score possible, by combining rollerskate tricks with eliminations. The player assumes the identity of Kara Hassan as she enters her first match. Your goal is to rise the ranks and hopefully become the Rollerdome champion – meaning you stay alive.\n“It’s been amazing to see this project come to life from the original prototype that received a lot of love online, all the way to the brutal and intense experience it is now – thanks to the amazing work of the team at Roll7,″ Paul Rabbitte, creative director at Roll7, said. “We’re really excited for players to jump into Rollerdrome.”",

The game got a new trailer at today’s presentation, along with a December 2 launch date.\nFor those not in the know, Striking Distance Studios is led by Glen Schofield, the same person who helped lead development of the original Dead Space way back in 2008. Even as EA is actively working on a remake of that original game, Schofield’s team is charting out a new universe of horror that is clearly inspired by the gameplay and visual palette of that older game.\nIn the new trailer, we get an extensive glimpse at the gory and terrifying gameplay in store for players when the game launches later this year. We see protagonist Jacob Lee as he makes his way through one scary-looking outer space locale to the next, often with the looming presence of the gas giant planet of Jupiter overhead.  \nJacob wanders through tight and dimly lit corridors before an array of monsters manage to get to him. We see an interesting mix of melee and ranged weapons that the scared hero can wield. But even with some helpful toys, things don't always go well for Jacob. Striking Distance is pulling no punches in regard to what happens to their lead character if players don’t manage to pull him out of trouble. In one especially disturbing concluding sequence, we see one of the creatures tear a portion of his head and face off in what is almost certainly a preface to a game over screen.\nThe Callisto Protocol just happens to be this month’s cover story at Game Informer, and you can head over to our game hub to check out all the info we’ve got on the game as it becomes available.\nIn the meantime, check out the trailer in all its creepy glory, and watch for The Callisto Protocol's release on December 2 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

While the brief trailer didn't show much in the way of gameplay, it did show various locations and characters from the game, and most importantly, a release date: March 24, 2023.\nMost strikingly – and predictably – the new Resident Evil 4 looks leagues better visually than its 2005 counterpart. During the minute-long trailer, we see protagonist Leon Kennedy, antihero Ada Wong, Ashley Graham, Luis, and brief glimpses of antagonists Osmund Saddler and Bitores Mendez. The trailer also shows quick looks at Salazar Castle and the iconic village from the beginning of RE4 and the baddies that inhabit them. The voiceover seems to indicate the game's story has been expanded and will act as a more direct sequel to Resident Evil 2, which also stars Leon as its protagonist. \nThe trailer ends with a brief tease that VR content is also in development for Resident Evil 4. \nSee the trailer in full below.\n\n\nThis is just the latest in the long line of Resident Evil remakes – which, if you're being exact, starts all the way back on the GameCube with the remake of the original 1996 game. In 2019, developer-publisher Capcom released a remake of Resident Evil 2, which was then followed by a Resident Evil 3: Nemesis remake in 2020. And if you're being technical, this is actually the second Resident Evil 4 remake in as many years – kind of. Last year, Capcom partnered with developer Armature Studios on the excellent Resident Evil 4 VR.",

          "description": "A new Horizon Forbidden West update was surprise announced during today's PlayStation State of Play stream and it's out now. \nIt brings many new highly requested features to the game, including New Game+, transmog, and more. More specifically, this update, which can be downloaded now, will allow players to begin a brand new game with all of their endgame gear. If they find a new gear set they prefer, they can take on all the stats of it while keeping the look of their favorite set thanks to transmog. \n\n\nElsewhere, this update allows players to completely reset their skills and redistribute skill points. That's going to be especially helpful for players who need to reshape their build in a new difficulty now live in Horizon Forbidden West: Ultra Hard difficulty. \nGuerrilla Games has been hard at work fixing visual problems with the game through multiple patches, such as shimmering in foliage and elsewhere, and today's update includes \"improved visual fidelity.\" There's no word on exactly what that addresses but it's probably safe to say the game will look better after installing the update. Finally, the last thing in today's update is the inclusion of new weapons to find and new trophies to obtain. \n\n\nHorizon Forbidden West is out now exclusively on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 and today's surprise update can be downloaded right now. While waiting for it to download, read Game Informer's Horizon Forbidden West review and then check out this adorable Aloy nendoroid figure. \nAre you jumping back into Horizon Forbidden West for any of these new features?

Find out why the machines are attacking.\" Today's Sony State of Play brought fans another look at Guerrilla Games' VR adventure, Horizon Call of the Mountain, though the trailer didn't specify a release window. However, it did reveal some of the game's big narrative plot points. The trailer, which you can watch below, was also filled with lush environments and showed off several impressive, first-person shots of the world's monstrous machines.\n\n\nYou'll be playing as Ryas, an entirely new character, who was once a Shadow Carja. He finds himself mysteriously released from prison by Blameless Marad, the Sun King's right-hand man, to combat a deadly threat. Skilled at climbing and archery, Ryas ends up washed ashore after a Snapmaw attacks his two captors. The wild rapids look like they'll be an experience in the PSVR2 game's campaign, but players can check out even more rushing waters in the Call of the Mountain River Ride. This bonus feature offers to show you Horizon's world in a totally new way. \nA post on PlayStation's blog offered more insight for players who are ready to jump into the Ryas' story, saying:\nBut that's not the only Horizon news from today's event.

A few of these reveals are games designed exclusively for the forthcoming PlayStation VR2 headset. We still haven't gotten our hands on this highly anticipated device, and today Sony made the wait for this moment all the more difficult with the announcement that Resident Evil Village, The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners – Chapter 2: Retribution, and No Man's Sky are all in development for it.\nThe footage for Resident Evil Village doesn't make the experience look much different, as it was already first person, but if it's anything like the other Resident Evil experiences, the headset will up the terror and immersion.\n\n\nThe Walking Dead gave us glimpses of using a chainsaw against zombie hordes, as well as other sharp instruments and firearms. Skydance Interactive and Skybound Entertainment say the game is slated to release in late 2022 for PSVR2.\n\n\nNo Man's Sky looks absolutely stunning, but we'll have to wait to get our hands on it to see if it's any different than the PC version.\n\n\nWhat did you think of Sony's showcase?

Universal is clearly a fan of it because Super Nintendo World expansions have received the greelight at both Universal Studios Hollywood and at the Universal Studios theme park in Florida. \nNow, we know the first Super Nintendo World in the U.S. will open in early 2023 in Hollywood. This news comes by way of the official Universal Studios Hollywood Twitter account, which revealed the early 2023 timeframe today alongside a picture that reveals Mario is no longer the short king he’s always been. Instead, he has extra long legs that – I’m going to be honest – ain’t right. Luigi is the tall one, Universal! Not Mario!!\nGet ready, #SuperNintendoWorld is coming to Universal Studios Hollywood in early 2023. pic.twitter.com/pCYaeHgWsq\nJune 2, 2022\nThis Twitter account also posted a quick teaser of the Mario Kart ride that will be at Super Nintendo World when it opens next year, and it looks amazing. It features not just traditional animatronics and in-ride sculptures but digital elements, too, in the form of screens and some kind of special glasses. Universal says we’ll be able to “ride through iconic courses, throw shells, and collect coins to beat Team Bowser” in the ride. \nYou’ve never experienced Mario Kart like this!

With an emphasis on third-party titles, there's been plenty of speculation on whether or not Capcom or Square Enix may make an appearance. The former has plenty for PlayStation fans to be excited about, including Resident Evil Village DLC and the recently announced Street Fighter 6. The latter also has big games coming to the PS5, including Forspoken and Final Fantasy XVI. Will any of the games listed make an appearance?

It's of course a reference to Solas, AKA The Dread Wolf, who happens to share a moniker with the game, although with a slight difference in spelling. Once an ally to players, this Solas is being set up as the big bad in Dreadwolf. The post describes him as maybe being \"an ancient elven god, but some say not. Others say a betrayer of his people…or a savior who now seeks to rescue them at the cost of your world. His motives are inscrutable and his methods sometimes questionable, earning him a reputation as something of a trickster deity—a player of dark and dangerous games.\"\nDragon Age: Dreadwolf and Solas' machinations won't see the light of day this year, according to the post, at least not in any playable form. However, there will be more information coming about the game before the year is over. Outside of that tease for upcoming details, there isn't much more to learn about the next chapter in the Dragon Age saga in the immediate future. So until then, enjoy knowing the official title and the logo above, which the studio does leave open for more meaning than just a reference to Solas.",

His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh's main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.\nMichael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.\nEmanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.\nAvijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet's task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.\nThe team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.\nPlease give a warm welcome to our new students! Let's make GSoC 2022 a huge success – together!\n>",
