          "description": "Quite the catch.\nPokémon made waves when it debuted on the Game Boy back in the '90s, introducing audiences to a new type of RPG that went on to become a global phenomenon. Since then, many have tried and failed to capture that same kind of experience, though it seems there’s been a renewed push in the last few years for indie developers to try out their own unique takes. While titles such as Monster Crown and Cassette Beasts have mostly followed the turn-based formula Pokémon first demonstrated, others such as Monster Sanctuary took things in a new direction. Adore, the latest release from the Brazil-based Cadabra Games, clearly falls somewhere closer to the latter group, and while it doesn’t absolutely nail the execution of its ideas, it certainly brings something new and interesting to the broader subgenre.\nAdore takes place in the world of Gaterdrik, a world ruled over by a good dragon named Draknar and a bad dragon named Ixer. Ixer kills Draknar in a big fight and seemingly dooms the world to darkness, but a piece of Draknar’s soul survives and attaches to one of his followers, an Adorer named Lukha. All Adorers can tame and summon various monsters that live in Gaterdrik, and now that he’s been juiced up with the power of his fallen god, Lukha sets out on a journey to finish the fight using the power of the monsters under his command. It’s not a terribly interesting story, but it gets the job done and provides just enough lore to keep the world from feeling empty or directionless.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

In a turn of events that only a select group of Bothan spies could have foretold, LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga has returned to the top spot once again demonstrating that it does, indeed, have unlimited power.\nThe reason for this return (of the Jedi) is likely due to last week's hefty discounts on Sony's PS5 console, one of which came bundled with the latest LEGO epic from a galaxy far, far away (the game's console split leant heavily in Sony's favour with 74% coming from PS5 while the Switch only contributed 23%).

          "description": "PlatinumGames co-founder, Bayonetta director and celebrated Twitter shoutyman Hideki Kamiya would like the \"retro\" game label to go out of fashion. His argument is that calling something \"retro\" is inherently condescending - each game has its own particular achievements and qualities that deserve to be understood in terms of more than just nostalgia cultivated by a novelty-driven industry. After all, Johnny 90s Developer didn't spend months knocking together a bespoke cover system or fancy artstyle so that you could badge it \"quaint\", \"old school\" and so on, 30 years later. Assuming you can still access the game at all.\n\"I don't like the word 'retro game',\" Kamiya told VGC in a wide-ranging interview also notable for some chunky insights on onomatopoeia in Japanese manga and its US adaptations. \"I'm obviously not a native English speaker so it might be something I'm interpreting from a Japanese perspective, but hearing the word 'retro' from a Japanese viewpoint, suggests more of a 'fad' brought back from a past era and reskinned for the current era.\"\nRead more",

No, it isn’t new races, or increased party sizes, or the removal of the weight limit (which you can get around by offloading spare loot to your Tardis-esque interdimensional campsite). What I’d like most is the ability to switch between characters during dialogue. You’ll trigger many of these conversations without warning as you explore the world, and I routinely bumble into chitchats the character I’m controlling isn’t quite prepped for.\nRead more",

Most of us who were knocking around the internet in the early 00s will have at least one online gravestone in the closet somewhere, whether it's a long abandoned LiveJournal or MySpace page, or an old internet forum that sadly doesn't exist anymore (RPS in peace). But for the citizens of Videoverse, an online community that's part and parcel of the soon to be defunct 1-bit video games console the Kinmoku Shark, this sense of an ending is something that many of them aren't equipped to deal with, least of all teenager Emmett, who's just discovered the fan page for his favourite video game, Feudal Fantasy. \nAs he deals with the prospect of having to bid farewell to friends old and new, including the mysterious but talented fan artist Vivi, Videoverse taps into a potent and nostalgic melancholy. It's a love letter to the early internet at its rose-tinted best, and to the lost, formative spaces that brought so many like-minded individuals together and gave them a sense of purpose. Yes, there are trolls spoiling everyone's fun, and yes, there's a hint of something more nefarious going on underneath Videoverse's source code. But another Hypnospace Outlaw this is not. Rather, this is a proto-internet tale that's all about the friendships we form online, and the bonds that carry us forward when real-life relationships just don't cut it anymore.\nRead more",

I could say the VR launch cupboard is a little bare at the moment, with Steam's New Releases list offering up a lot of dour military shooters, dubious Early Access projects, and fantasy dismemberment porn. I could say that The Room VR: A Dark Matter has just received a PSVR2 release, so now seems an opportune moment to revisit this acclaimed spin-off puzzler. I could say that The Room VR is the only entry in the series RPS hasn't covered yet. But to be perfectly honest, I just fancied playing The Room VR. So there.\r\n\n\r\nOh all right, there was a slightly more specific reason why I wanted to revisit a game that came out just three days after Half-Life: Alyx. Upon its launch, there wasn't much else like The Room on VR devices, a dedicated puzzler with high production values that didn't feel the need to throw in a gun to shoot or a melon to chop. Now, there are bunch of fantastic VR brain-ticklers swimming in the pond, such as the time-travelling epic Wanderer, the perspective-bending A Fisherman's Tale series, and the ingenious automation extravaganza The Last Clockwinder. \r\n\n \nRead more",

I quit playing Frank And Drake twice before even meeting its second protagonist, but something about it kept pulling me back.\r\n\nIt's partly the style. Some gorgeous rotoscoping gives its few characters a sense of constant motion that's unreal and very lifelike at once, and it's sometimes pushed further by having them decelerate to a blurred freeze frame when you stop walking. The backgrounds are static but interactable things shimmer a bit, like in old cartoons where you could always tell what was background and what was going to do something. More than that, though, it had me intrigued.\nRead more",

On the surface he seems like a cheerful sprite, ready to pat his little drum and have everyone do a nice little dance.

Having been burned out of Destiny 2 and most live service games, we discovered Remnant 2 delivers all the benefits of blasting gangly creatures for skill points without all the live service baggage. What a refreshing thing.\nThing is, if two out of the three major bosses we've faced so far took us to court for cheesing them, we'd lose. And it brings us no greater pleasure, knowing we've carved powerful new weapons out of their remains. God, it feels good to be totally undeserving of any credit whatsoever.\nRead more",

And there are so many things I love about Portal 2 that it's quite hard to pick just one thing to write about.\nI could do \"the joy of Portal 2's retro science\", where you fall through the floor into the old school Aperture Science labs and see the 60s-ish version of all the big buttons and testing chambers you were put through in the first Portal. I could do \"the joy of the corrupted personality cores in Portal 2\", a group of corrupted AI spheres including Rick The Adventure Sphere, which is largely just Nolan North making up his own action theme song. I could even do \"the joy of potatoes in Portal 2\". And then I realised that most of the things I like about Portal 2 also intersect with Stephen Merchant's character Wheatley, a weird little guy (in the most pejorative sense).\nRead more",

But once you get in-game, his toolkit has always been fairly underwhelming - with the exception of his Death Totem, which never seemed to sit well thematically with the character.\nSeason 18 of Apex looks to change all that. Revenant is finally getting the love he deserves with a new sinister-looking base skin and a full rework of all his abilities. And guys, I think they might have gone a bit too far making him scary again. I think he might be overpowered.\nRead more",

          "description": "The distance from the roof of the Counting House to the nearest building in Baldur’s Gate is vast, by design. The waterfront bank where the city’s great, good and gangster store their gold stands with its back to the sea, while a long and well-guarded bridge extends from its maw, like a money-hungry tongue. Legend says its top two floors are entirely without windows, the House an eyeless god to the citizens who reside on the hillside that slopes down toward the docks. So how was Gale, the wizard prodigy, able to bound from a faraway balcony to the brim of the bank, as if stepping lazily out onto his porch with a mug of coffee? Some say strange sorcery was afoot, but I’ve seen his character sheet, and so can be more specific.\nUpon levelling up, Gale multiclassed as a sorcerer - an odd choice, but one that allowed him to unlock the ability to throw magic from a great range. Suddenly, while casting a teleport spell, this hybrid mage was able to reach across the wide moat of the Counting House and land safely on a high ledge. It’s one of many obscure class synergies via which, Larian imagines, you’ll be able to break their level design in unexpected and entertaining ways.\nRead more",

GLaDOS’ return, for instance, is a stretch of pure puzzling with just a dash of dread, while your first steps into the abandoned 1960s Aperture facility interrupt a fairly hopeless tone with an upbeat sense of discovery. For me, though, Portal 2 peaks late. So late that by the time it begins, your journey through the 'true' puzzle chambers are essentially over, leaving you as little more than a loose end in the big glowing eye of a former buddy. It’s Chapter 9: The Part Where He Kills You! Mmm, love that part.\nRead more",

It's certainly one of my personal favourites, and as this year's RPS 100 has proven, it's also greatly beloved by the rest of the RPS Treehouse. A brilliantly conceived murder mystery puzzle box (boat?) that not only has you working out whodunnit, but howdunnit, Obra Dinn is one of those detective games that really thrusts you into the thick of its deduction process. As you set about working out the identities and causes of death for each of the 60 souls onboard, it places you firmly in front of the ship's wheel before giving you free rein to steer its hull of supernatural horrors into whatever port of judgment you deem fit. \nThere are no truly wrong answers in Obra Dinn, but due to the nature of how you go about solving it, it's also one of those games I can't play too often without feeling like I know all the answers already. It's only now, five years later, that I feel like I could probably go back to Lucas Pope's nautical masterpiece and marvel at it afresh on a second playthrough, but there's one particular set of crew unmaskings that even its time-travelling stopwatch can't erase from my memory banks. Spoilers to follow obviously, but if you know, you know. I'm talking about the shoe and hammock revelation. \nRead more",

Moans and screeches assault your ears from every nook and cranny of this dark murder hole, and if the hoarse crow calls and suspiciously high number of propane barrels weren't enough to put you off, the bloodied torsos lodged against its log cabin walls by deep set saw blades certainly will. Every fibre of your being is telling you to get the hell out of this place, and that surely, the Combine forces chasing you down here can't be worse than what's in front of you. \nBut I'd also add an addendum to that heading that goes something like this: \"We don't go to Ravenholm, and definitely not with just a gravity gun.\" This is a place that demands you to have as much firepower as you can possibly muster, such are the monstrosities that lie in wait here. But what did baby Katharine decide to do when she was playing it alone on her terrible university laptop in the dead of night back in 2010?

It's the same feeling I got from the blocky delights of Diplomacy Is Not An Option and the deckbuilding, comic-book stylings of ORX, too, but now there's a new kid that's ridden into town who I think might be the king of the lot. \nThronefall is a more minimalist take on the citybuilder tower defender, but while its bright colours might look like the distant cousin of a Townscaper toybox (it is, after all, made by the same dev wot did the equally charming Islanders), this deadly little thing is absolutely genius. It's only just come out in early access today, but I've been having a great time with a pre-release build of it, and can feel it sinking its claws into me with every attempt at its final level. \nRead more",

          "description": "Civil Protection officers are shorter than I thought they’d be. Don’t get me wrong, I'm very much a Short King myself, but I assumed the gas mask-wearing enforcers of City 17 would be more vertically intimidating. As I defiantly refuse to pick up litter in Half-Life 2’s opening sequence, I find the approaching officer and his raised electric baton to be weirdly adorable. Until he hits me, of course. The resulting crack gives me such a fright that I fling my arms out and smack my hand against the corner of a bookcase.\nThis has been my experience of playing the first few hours of Half-Life 2’s excellent fan-made VR mod, a completely free add-on that transforms Valve’s 2004 masterpiece into a full virtual reality experience. Under my direct control, Gordon Freeman is less a time-displaced MIT graduate with a penchant for murder and instead a gawking tourist who’s more interested in staring at canal architecture than liberating humanity. I spend the majority of my time leaning in really close to walls and muttering, “That’s interesting,” before a leaping headcrab shocks me so severely that I damage some more furniture and scare the cat.\nRead more",

Its showcase of HDR lighting might have lost the \"Huh, nice\" factor it had in 2005, but it’s still a satisfying slice of punchy HL2 combat, with a nod to the original Half-Life that Valve regretted not making in the main game. I know this because Valve told me, via Lost Coast's other innovation: its developer commentary.\nI love these things, these spinning speech bubbles inflated with knowledge straight from the FPS coalface. So do Valve, judging by how dev commentary has appeared (in identical, node-activatable form) in most of their games since. They’re interesting and illuminating, don’t interfere with the game unless the player wants them to, and help build design literacy. Why, then, don’t more games offer commentary as well?\nRead more",

I had to give up whole days of biking in the desert with my brother and playing video games, sure, but the real problem was school supplies. My poor mom had to track down a huge list of supplies the school said we needed, from pencils and paper to expensive binders and calculators. Sure, back to school sales took the sting out of these mandatory purchases, but it was often a real stretch to get everything I needed, and I'd need to make friends quickly to borrow anything I didn't manage to come to school with. \nThat's why I was particularly amused, a decade and a bit later, to find out that Ebay is offering 20% off back to school purchases in the US, and that category of products includes a $999 LG OLED gaming monitor. Even for a university student, that's one heck of an upgrade for the new school year - but a darn good deal if you're considering this kind of ultra-premium gaming monitor. \n\nGet the LG 27GR95QE 27-inch 240Hz 1440p OLED gaming monitor for $718 w/ code SAVE4SCHOOL (was $999)\n\nRead more",

It isn't one of Citizen Sleeper's more emotional story beats (I miss ya, Lem and Mina), nor is it its most thrilling (big love to my man Feng). Rather, it's one of the game's quietest and arguably least significant plot points, but the fact it's there at all is probably what cemented Citizen Sleeper as one of my favourite games of last year.

          "description": "I can almost remember the moment in the original Dishonored when I realised, \"Crap. Chaos is coming, and there's nothing I can do to stop it.\" It was around the halfway point of the game that the world of Dunwall was visibly starting to sour before me, and it was all because I hadn't quite taken the time to truly understand how its chaos system worked. I'd let too many of my mistakes get away from me, killed one too many people in the process, and now its Low Chaos ending seemed permanently out of reach. I thought in vain that if I behaved really nicely for the rest of the game, it might balance out my former transgressions. But alas, it was not to be. I ended the game in High Chaos, and I was furious. For whatever reason, getting a game's 'good' ending really mattered to me back then.\nIt was this personal failing that drove me to some extreme lengths when Dishonored 2 came out a couple of years later. Not only did I resolve to do a Clean Hands run this time, guaranteeing a Low Chaos ending by refusing to kill anyone, but as I cast my eye down its list of Steam achievements, I also got it into my head that, 'You know what? If we're going no-kill, let's Shadow run it as well and do it completely unseen at the same time.' A great idea at the time, I thought, if a little unusual for me. Cut to my fifth hour trying to clean out Kirin Jindosh's Clockwork Mansion on a review deadline, however, and you might think that decision would have worn a little thin.

          "description": "Dishonored 2 is an immersive sim stealth 'em up by Arkane and it's been in my brain a lot more than usual. Partly due to this year's RPS 100, but also because of the mess that was Redfall. Arkane swung at the live service hero shooter and missed, with some comments writing off my sadness in the review as an inevitability. Sure, there's definitely truth to Arkane having changed over the years, of course it has. But I don't think there's anything wrong with being hopeful.\nI think of Dishonored 2's A Crack In The Slab mission as both a beacon of Arkane's past pedigree and a symbol of their situation in the present. While I can't look into the future, I still think there's worth in turning to an all-time classic of a stealth level.\nRead more",

          "description": "The Expanse is one of those TV shows that I've started to watch about three times now. Matthew (RPS in peace) and I keep hearing great things about it, but every attempt we make has always ended the same way. We get a couple of episodes in, determined to make it a little bit further than we did before, but there's just something about it that can't quite hold our interest long enough to properly stick with it. One day, though, I do hope to finish the first season of The Expanse, and my ideal scenario is for the episodic prequel game from Telltale and current Life Is Stange custodians Deck Nine to be just the kick up the bum I need to get through it.\nThe Expanse: A Telltale Series started the fortnightly release of its five episodes on the Epic Games Store last week, and I played through the first, Archer's Paradox, over the weekend. As you'd perhaps expect from a first episode, the plot scales lean heavily toward setup here as opposed to actionable 'so and so will remember that' choices. Still, its centrepiece of exploring a big exploded battleship to find some sort of money-printing macguffin is also like such a sedate, threat-free version of Dead Space that it can't help but feel a little lightweight at the same time - and that's not just because you're floating around in zero gravity for half of it. It does a reasonable job of laying down what I hope is some good groundwork for the origin story for TV favourite Camina Drummer, and her fellow crewmates are a fun, bubbling pressure cooker of personalities just waiting to spill over into conflict, but I do also worry that the game will have the same truncated fate as my attempts to watch the show. \nRead more",

The process begins with excruciating headaches, escalates to fingers twisting by themselves, and culminates with an octopus head spouting out of the body. That gross transformation is what you’re (maybe) trying to avoid at the start of Baldur’s Gate 3, but developer Larian Studios have now explained how the parasites \"tie into\" its RPG systems. Yep, you can choose to either embrace or resist the tempting corruption, with the former giving you some pretty cool party tricks, while the latter means you won’t be subjected to David Cronenberg-esque body horror.

With almost 30 minutes of uninterrupted gameplay, we got to see exactly how they work in practice, and most importantly, we got a big long look at the monk's beautifully choreographed staff twirling melee attacks. Yes please and thank you. I have to say, this is instantly more exciting to me than biffing skeletons with my Druid in Diablo 4, and I'm very pumped indeed to try the Monk out for myself when Path Of Exile 2 enters its closed beta in June next year.\nRead more",

MS zároveň neposkytl podrobnosti o tom, co se stalo (problém bude asi závažnější). Je velmi pravděpodobné, že Čína má k dispozici zdrojové kódy jak MS produktů, tak i MS Azure. Údajně je získala kvůli malware, který Rusko zaneslo do aktualizace produktu SolarWinds. Tuto aktualizaci si údajně stáhlo kolem 14 000 klientů a je velmi pravděpodobné, že infrastruktury těchto klientů (včetně MS) byly napadeny / vykradeny ještě před tím, než se na malware přišlo a byl odstraněn.

          "description": "The original Red Dead Redemption will come to the PS4 and Nintendo Switch in a little over a week. This is great news, as we're talking about one of the very few highly successful games of the post '2010s that hasn't seen a single re-release. Few feelings beat knowing that the wait is over—even when we didn't know we were waiting for something in the first place.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5Nwgd_T1-4\nThough Rockstar isn't calling it a remaster, this RDR release developed by Double Eleven Studios looks a bit sharper than it did on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. An actual HD remaster was reportedly on the table for some time, but plans seem to have dissipated. From the way Rockstar is promoting it, it seems like the company is just going for an uncompromisingly straightforward re-release.\nThis is definitely not the RDR remake in Unreal Engine or in the Red Dead Redemption 2 engine that some have been speculating about for a while. The Red Dead Redemption re-release will also contain the famous Undead Nightmare DLC. This neat add-on clearly banked on the '2010s zombie craze by taking John Marston in a possibly non-canonical side quest against hordes of undead cowboys, but it's still pretty fun to play nowadays.\nRed Dead Redemption for the PS4 and Nintendo Switch will cost $49.99. The digital format will be up for download on August 17. The physical version will come out on October 13. The PS4 version will also run on PS5.\nThe post Red Dead Redemption is coming to PS4 and Switch next week appeared first on Destructoid.",

With record entrants and an already warm reception, it's easy to say expectations were high. Still, I don't think we could have expected the stellar grand finals Street Fighter 6 got.\nLet's set the stage a bit, first. The Evolution Championship Series, or Evo, is one of the most storied and respected fighting game tournaments around. Alongside its massive attendance, Evo is also an open tournament, so anyone can put up the entrance money and fight. To win Evo is to, by extrapolation, beat everyone at Evo.

          "description": "I remember where I was when Blue Dragon was announced. Although I already had an Xbox 360 and was ready for it, some folks I knew bought one just for it given who was involved (Nobuo Uematsu, Hironobu Sakaguchi, Akira Toriyama): as Mistwalker and Microsoft Game Studios made a mad dash to put out more games from Japanese studios on the Xbox ecosystem.\nSo how did it actually go? Well, it depends on who you ask. For some, it was a dazzling RPG that stayed with them long after the credits rolled (no doubt in part due to famed artist Akira Toriyama's character designs), and helped pave the way for better games just like it. For others, it was a run-of-the-mill project that relied heavily on its presentation, without bringing a whole lot to the table compared to similar games before it. It's also roughly 50 hours long (originally across three discs), so if you aren't into it early on, odds are you'll fall off way before the end.\nYou can find out for yourself how it all went down with our new Lost in Time series, which will be airing every other week on the Destructoid YouTube channel. It's also still on sale digitally for $19.99 on the Xbox storefront and is playable on Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S.\nIf you're interested in hearing more about this often-forgotten RPG, check out the video on it below. The video team is currently looking for feedback on this series and what you might want to see in the future: so let them know in the YouTube comments!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlE0Sbt-jqU\nThe post Did you play Blue Dragon?

          "description": "Windows will almost certainly be the default operating system for more PC users and gamers. However, Linux seems to be slowly climbing the ranks, and it's now the second most popular OS on Steam, which could be owing to Valve's handheld device, the Steam Deck.\nAccording to a report from Phoronix (as spotted by Ars Technica), Linux saw its share of the market increase by half a percent for June, giving it a 1.96% share of the operating system pie.\n[caption id=\"attachment_395246\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot via Destructoid.[/caption]\nThis means, as of now, it's beaten macOS, which currently has a market share of 1.84%. Of course, both pale in comparison to Windows, with the anonymous Steam survey showing that the Microsoft OS dominates with a whopping 96.21% share.\nAre more people turning to Linux then?\nThe one thing that needs to be taken into account is that much of this increase in Linux usage may well be down to the Steam Deck itself. The portable PC comes preinstalled with the SteamOS software, which is built on a custom version of Linux.\nErgo, anyone who buys a Deck to play games through their Steam account will be shown as being a Linux user. The version \"SteamOS Holo\" 64-bit was the most popular Linux version reported, which adds to the Steam Deck's case. It's also worth noting that not everyone will have taken the survey, but any discrepancies may not be significant anyway.\nIf anything, it kind of shows the popularity of the Steam Deck, that it's managed to influence the operating system market in this way. While companies like ASUS are offering their own alternatives, the Valve machine is still a force to be reckoned with in terms of mobile PC gaming.\nThe post Linux passes Mac for Steam’s second-most used OS, possibly due to Steam Deck appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you ever want an understanding of how Skyrim has managed to stay alive these past 12 years, just look to the modding community. There are tons of ways to tweak The Elder Scrolls 5, and a new one has recently come out that takes cues from one of Rockstar's most critically acclaimed releases.\nOver on Nexus Mods, veteran modder JaySerpa has been at it once again. This time, they've brought the sport of hunting to the chilly world of Skyrim. Called \"Simple Hunting Overhaul,\" it gives the Dragonborn the ability to take time out from all that hero questing and dragon slaying.\nhttps://youtu.be/m1aK9Njuxbo\nYou can skin the corpses of animals that have been killed, which you can then sell to vendors in a nearby town or city. Typical with JaySerpa's projects, this mod also incorporates NPC reactions to your hunting, making for a more immersive experience.\nThe creator says this Skyrim hunting mod of theirs was inspired by Red Dead Redemption 2. No prizes for guessing which particular aspect of the game.\nWho even plays vanilla Skyrim these days?\nIf you play the game on PC, you'll already be very familiar with the near-countless ways you can mess with Bethesda's epic 2011 RPG. Because, let's face it: after well over a decade, the cracks in Skyrim are more than showing.\nThe vanilla experience is still fun, but there's no sense in pretending that it's not aged quite significantly. This is where modding comes to the rescue, and people like JaySerpa are responsible for keeping TES5 very much in the limelight. That, and Bethesda wouldn't stop re-releasing the damn thing.\nWe can't say for certain whether The Elder Scrolls 6 will ever be able to live up to such a legacy. In fact, we can't even say for certain at what stage of development it's currently at. But Bethesda's next big RPG, Starfield, is due out in less than a month.\nThe post Skyrim hunting mod takes inspiration from Red Dead Redemption 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Those who have been paying attention to the gaming world these past few days won't be surprised to learn that Baldur's Gate 3 is currently doing quite well for itself. In fact, when last checked, the game had hit a pretty big milestone, showing more than 800,000 concurrent players on Steam.\nTo get a bit more specific, according to SteamDB (a website that tracks and monitors all things related to the Steam client), the new Baldur's Gate experienced a peak of 814,666 players within the last 24 hours.\nhttps://youtu.be/XuCfkgaaa08\nBearing in mind, the game only came out last Thursday, so who knows whether this number could yet be beaten.\nTake THAT, 97 other games\nGoing one step further, Baldur's Gate 3 is currently the third most-played game on Steam, just behind Dota 2 and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Given that these other titles were either developed or published by Valve, you can safely say that BG3 is the most non-Valve-played game at the moment.\nLarian Studios' release had an impressive launch when it came out on August 3, scoring pretty big on PC. At the time of writing, it's sitting pretty with a Metacritic score of 95 and a user score of 9.2.\nIt's been nearly 23 years since the last major installment in the Baldur's Gate series (though we've had expansions and enhanced editions), so fans of the previous games have no doubt been massively anticipating this third entry.\nIt's hard to say whether this hype will continue, or whether we're seeing its peak already. After all, Sons of the Forest was a major overnight success, selling two million copies in just one day. Now, you don't really hear much from the co-op horror title. Then again, the Baldur's Gate name is likely to carry more weight in the AAA scene.\nThe post Baldur’s Gate 3 surpasses 800,000 concurrent players on Steam appeared first on Destructoid.",

The day arrived, and a massive crowd reportedly showed up today for the event.\nCenat broadcast a video on Twitch, advertising PlayStation 5s and gift cards to give away, before leaving his bus and heading out. Things took a turn though, into what could be described as a \"bit of a commotion.\" It's unclear what sparked this turn at this time.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZEmdQxfliM\nThe New York Police Department mobilized with an estimated 1,000 officers, per NBC New York. Several videos caught glimpses of the chaos, ranging from what looks like people spraying fire extinguishers to Cenat apparently being taken into custody.\nNYPD later confirmed during a press conference that when the crowd grew too large, they declared it an \"unlawful assembly\" and began to clear the area. The NYPD chief of police Jeffrey Maddrey said officers filled a bus with arrestees, but did not confirm how many were in custody following the New York giveaway event-gone-south.\nA spokesperson confirmed to NBC New York that Cenat and \"numerous\" other people were in custody. It's not clear yet if any charges will be filed, though Maddrey did suggest that \"inciting a riot\" could be considered.\nhttps://twitter.com/NYPDnews/status/1687584007230468096\nCenat is a popular streamer who garnered headlines earlier this year for a record of most active subscribers on Twitch, previously held by others like Tyler \"Ninja\" Blevins and Ludwig Ahgren.\nLead image via CBS News\nThe post Streamer taken into custody after New York giveaway event gets chaotic appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Via Twitter (which I refuse to ever call “X”), Sega has revealed screens of the canceled Sega Saturn title, Sonic X-treme.\nSega had a really rough time in the late ‘90s. The launch of the Sega Saturn was an absolute cluster of confusion, as they had one foot in 2D while sticking another right up in 3D. Not to mention, Sega of America misunderstood its own market and thought that adding life support to the Sega Genesis was the best idea, delaying the arrival of the Saturn in Western markets. Some people blame its failure on the fact that there was never a mainline Sonic the Hedgehog successor on the platform. Sure, yeah, that might be part of it.\n[caption id=\"attachment_395103\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Sega[/caption]\nDevelopment on Sonic X-treme began shortly after the completion of Sonic 3 & Knuckles. It started on the Genesis/Mega Drive before bouncing to the 32X and finally the Saturn. Initially, it was just going to be a better-looking side-scroller, but by the time it reached the Saturn, it became a hybrid of 2D and 3D, the style of which is very much obvious in these screenshots.\nIt’s hard to say exactly when these screenshots are from. The development of Sonic X-treme was marred by unclear hardware specs, developer fallout and turnover, the dysfunction between Sega’s Japan and American branches, and life-threatening illness. It’s an absolutely bizarre development story. There were a lot of different revisions to the game, all of them very different.\n[caption id=\"attachment_395104\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Sega[/caption]\nHopefully, with these images unearthed, we’ll get to hear more of the tale. For now, we can only look and wonder how Sonic X-treme would have turned out.\nThe post Sega unearths promotional screens for the cancelled Sonic X-treme appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s airing August 7th at 8 a.m. PST. You love anticipating things, so get ready to hear about all the things you’ll be anticipating for longer than you expected.\nIt takes a lot of courage to put on a stream that showcases all the games you’re heroically delaying until 2024. Thankfully, Devolver Digital has a tonne of courage that they’ve been harvesting from their developers for just such an occasion. You know what Shigeru Miyamoto famously said: “A good game is here now, a delayed game is forever.”\nhttps://twitter.com/devolverdigital/status/1687477843956027392?s=20\nOh, golly. What games are you hoping get delayed? Skate Story? The Talos Principle 2? Gunbrella!? Devolver has just provided so many great games that they can now use to crush our spirits in Devolver Delayed. Every month that the development period of a game is extended, it heightens the chance that the world will end before we ever get to experience it. Isn’t that exciting?\nI’ve always said that my favorite part of this job is not playing games, so Devolver Delayed is something I can really get behind. It’s basically Devolver Digital saying, “Leave the procrastination to us. Shhh. Shhh. You’re safe now.” The only thing that could possibly be more exciting is a “Nintendo Canceled Game Direct” or a “Konami Games-We’re-Never-Making Showcase.”\nSet your microwaves for the Devolver Delayed stream on August 7th at 8am PST and get ready for plenty of reasons to scream into a pillow.\nThe post Devolver Digital lines up Devolver Delayed stream for August 7th appeared first on Destructoid.",

Recently, there have been more details about changes that will be happening to some of the major aspects and equipment of the co-op ghost hunting game.\nIn a post on Steam, the studio has unleashed number 13 of its \"Dev Preview\" update. This time, we're treated to what's going to be happening with the ID cards. While not receiving major changes, these will at least now display the platform you're playing on (handy, seeing as Phasmophobia is coming to consoles).\n[caption id=\"attachment_395037\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"] Image via Kinetic Games.[/caption]\nThere's also a new edit button that will allow you to change the look of your ID card, and a Roman numeral will be placed before your level, indicating your Prestige (a kind-of record of the level you were at before the big reset).\nIs there anybody there?\nOne major change is there are going to be three parabolic microphones instead of one. Much like some of the other equipment that's getting an overhaul, the mics will come in three tiers, with the second tier being similar to the one that's currently in the game.\nThe first parabolic microphone won't have a display screen like the others, but the idea of it muffling the sound around you so you can hear better could make this a much more immersive piece of kit.\nAs for when the big Phasmophobia update is coming, Kinetic did have to push the date back, and it's now due to start rolling out sometime this month. It should also be stated that anything the studio has been revealing is still a work-in-progress and may not represent the finished product.\nIf you haven't been keeping up with things surrounding the game, Phasmo is going through a big change, which will not only implement level resets for all players, but will be tweaking and adding a lot of new stuff.

If you thought the era of remakes, remasters, and reboots was over, think again.\nSpeculation comes from a report on Dealabs (via VGC). The leaker says that, having gained access to some evaluation documents, a remaster of Quake 2 could be getting announced at this year's QuakeCon.\n[caption id=\"attachment_395011\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"] Image via is Software/Lightspeed Studios.[/caption]\nThe event is scheduled to run from August 10 to August 13, so news about this supposed reimagining of the 1997 shooter could be just over the horizon. The report from Dealabs goes on to say that \"enhanced\" and \"remastered\" are being tossed around to describe the alleged project, as well as giving information about potential platforms.\nAlready been suspected\nThanks to the video game rating board in Korea, we've already been made aware that Quake 2 could be making a comeback. We still don't know whether this is happening, but it's bound to stir up plenty of fans, especially the older ones.\nWhile Quake 2 was a phenomenal hit when it released more than two and half decades ago, it did represent a bit of a shift for the developer. It was the first game the studio made without John Romero, so his influence is not to be found.\nIt was also a complete tonal shift from the original Quake. The first game had a darker and more gothic (almost horror) aspect about it, while the follow-up was much more \"space marine\", sci-fi action, with splashes of brown and gray.\nHopefully, we'll know more about this supposed Quake 2 remaster (or \"enhanced\" version), but for now, reel in those expectations until official confirmation.\nThe post Quake 2 remaster could be announced at this year’s QuakeCon appeared first on Destructoid.",

There's also Telltale's Walking Dead series, specifically the Definitive edition, which contains all four seasons.\nOther titles included in the Steam Visual Novel Fest include The Pillars of Earth, the adaptation of Ken Follett's epic story set in 12th century England, as well as SFB Games' Tangle Tower, Toge Productions' Coffee Talk, and more.\nSteam is well known for putting on plenty of festivals and events to keep us out of pocket throughout the year. Recently, we had the Stealth Fest which, as you can imagine, was a celebration of all things stealthy and clandestine.\nCombined with all the sales that happen, it's a wonder any of us have any money left. While there are alternatives when it comes to PC digital storefronts, Steam is the OG, having dominated the market for 20 years. Honestly, with events like this, it's not really surprising that it continues to reign supreme.\nThe post Steam’s Visual Novel Fest will feature The Walking Dead, Phoenix Wright, and more appeared first on Destructoid.",

On the surface, it looks like a simulator for those horrible games in malls and bowling alleys. The ones that are barely games and dangle amazing prizes are just out of reach. However, that’s not what The Coin Game is about.\nThe real concept of The Coin Game is that you’re trapped in the simulation of a rural town, and your only means of coping with your nightmarish existence is to gamble for cheap prizes.

For example, you can take things back to Bethesda days of yore by picking up the first two Elder Scrolls game for free. Even Morrowind (the third entry in the series) is going dirt cheap.\nIf retro shooters are your thing, the first four Quake games are on offer, while Wolfenstein 3D is a staggering 70% off. Of course, you can't talk classic FPS without mentioning Doom and, yep, they're currently discounted as well.\nFor those who don't know, QuakeCon is an annual game convention that began in 1996. Originally a way for people to celebrate the early Quake and Doom releases, the event has since ballooned into something bigger.\nThis year will see QuakeCon 2023 return to in-person after being a digital-only convention for the past three years.

Activision confirmed today’s reveal last week after the game leaked online.\nThe teaser doesn’t provide much to go on except the release date; platforms are unannounced, but we imagine it'll be on the usual suspects. Sledgehammer Games is taking the reins, making it the first Modern Warfare title not made by Infinity Ward (but it's still assisting, as all Call of Duty studios tend to). Sledgehammer's last entry was 2021’s Call of Duty: Vanguard, and it also developed WWII and Advanced Warfare. \n\n\nIn the meantime, be sure to check out our Modern Warfare II review and read how that game and Warzone will continue to get content updates in the form of new celebrity operators such as Snoop Dogg and Nicki Minaj.

The showcase highlights five games in particular: The Plucky Squire, Skate Story, Anger Foot, Stick it to the Stickman, and Pepper Grinder.\n\"We have some exciting news about next year,\" one host says. \"This year's delays,\" the other host follows up. \"Some of our brightest upcoming titles are finding their way to 2024!\"\nThe Plucky Squire, a game that bounces between 2D and 3D gameplay, is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Pixel-art platformer Pepper Grinder is currently slated to arrive on Switch and PC. Meanwhile, roguelite brawler Stick it to the Stickman, kickflipping sports-action game Skate Story, and foot-based first-person shooter Anger Foot are currently only listed for PC. \nYou can see the full Devolver Delayed Showcase below.\n\n\nDevolver Digital has had a solid 2023, with titles like Terra Nil receiving positive reviews, fan-favorite Bleak Sword DX making its way to Switch and PC, and new content for Cult of the Lamb, but today's delays are sure to disappoint some. However, by this point in time, many players recognize that it's better to delay a game than to launch it before it's ready, and with Gunbrella and The Talos Principle 2 still slated for 2023, the indie publisher still has seemingly a lot in store for fans before the calendar changes over to 2024.",

During this weekend's Evo 2023 fighting game tournament, we received a host of new announcements, including new characters added to the roster of the upcoming Mortal Kombat 1 and even a surprise TMNT collaboration with Street Fighter 6. However, Capcom didn't stop there, as it gave us the first teaser trailer for its 20th playable character, A.K.I.\nDescribed as \"a manaical poison aficionado,\" A.K.I. certainly seems to fit right in with the long lineage of over-the-top and deranged characters within the Street Fighter universe. You can check out the surprisingly dark teaser trailer for A.K.I. below.\n\n\nWhile we already knew A.K.I. was planned, the teaser comes hot on the heels of the release of Rashid, the first DLC character for Street Fighter 6. Rashid debuted in Street Fighter V, but joined the roster of Street Fighter 6 less than two weeks prior to this teaser. A.K.I. arrives in Street Fighter 6 this fall. Both characters – as well as the two remaining members of Year 1, Ed and Akuma – are included in the Deluxe Edition, Ultimate Edition, or Year 1 Character Pass. Rashid is also currently available for individual purchase for 350 Fighter Coins (approximately $7). Regardless of how you obtain Rashid, you also get his secondary outfit and two additional color options. It stands to reason that A.K.I. will follow a similar release method. \nFor more on Street Fighter 6, check out our glowing review of the game, as well as our cover story.

Reptile is back in his more human form but can still shapeshift into his natural, intimidating lizard body to devour opponents.  \nFans of 2004’s Mortal Kombat: Deception should be happy to see the returns of Ashrah and Havik. Each made their debut in that game, and neither has appeared in the series since Deception’s follow-up, Mortal Kombat: Armageddon in 2006. Ashrah sports a much different look and moveset but remains a demoness mostly cleansed of her inherent evil. Havik appears to retain his chaotic brand of body-contorting, limb-tearing offense. Sareena has also been confirmed as a new Kameo fighter to fan the flame of 2000s nostalgia. Check out the new trailer and a fresh batch of screenshots below. \n\n\n       \n\nMortal Kombat 1 launches on September 19 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.

          "description": "Publisher Tate Multimedia and developer Trialforge Studio have released the debut trailer for Deathbound, its new Soulslike action RPG with a unique class-based twist coming to Steam next year. \nSet in a crumbling civilization where unnatural science clashes with fanatical faith, players take on the role of a warrior set on confronting the Church of Death. In this world – Ziêminal – there's no good and no evil; just monsters and enemies in your way. And if today's Deathbound trailer is anything to go on, they won't go down without a fight. \nCheck out the Deathbound reveal trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, players can freely switch between various heroes of different classes in a party at any time, and they'll need to do so to survive in specific situations. Trialforge Studio calls this a \"Binding System, allowing players to absorb the essence of the fallen warriors found throughout the world.\" Using the collected essence, players can obtain new skills and abilities to transform their playstyle, or they can use it to form a party of heroes they can then switch between. \nBinding also unlocks Morphstrikes, which combines all of a party's power into a devastating blow. \n\n\"The memories and identities of the fallen will be uncovered through Binding as well,\" a press release reads. \"In addition to environment and items, essence will reveal the narrative behind the world of Ziêminal and its inhabitants. Though players must tread carefully when Binding, as not all heroes converge harmoniously. The conflicts caused by divergent essences absorbed will greatly impact the gameplay and narrative alike.\" \nDeathbound is due out sometime in 2024 on Steam.",

The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it?

While handheld titles, the poorly received Sonic the Hedgehog 4, and other games like Sonic Generations and Sonic Colors contained 2D gameplay, Sonic Mania felt like the true successor to the beloved titles that appeared on Genesis and Sega CD throughout the 1990s. A sequel felt all but inevitable, but when Sega and Sonic Mania mastermind Christian Whitehead decided to amicably go in creatively different directions (read the full story here), Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka still wanted to build on the success experienced with Sonic Mania.\n\"During Sonic Mania's development, I didn't expect this level of fan reaction or success,\" Iizuka says. \"That success created the opportunity to think a…",

The game’s eerie atmosphere and lack of dialogue lend to the game’s enigmatic nature, and multiple endings offer various truths about the threat you face.\n\n\nSomerville launched for Xbox and PC last November to generally warm reviews, though was noted for its rough technical performance, which has since been improved in post-launch updates. In a press release, Jumpship promises the PlayStation port will be the “best version of Somerville yet” and will feature DualSense haptic feedback.\nFor more on Somerville, you can read Game Informer's Somerville review and editor Kyle Hilliard's opinion piece on why it's the best alien invasion game since Half-Life 2.",

These include production coordinator Sebastian Marlow, associate producer Nora Falcon, senior environment artist Matthew Smith, and VFX artist Matt Christopherson. \nA spokesperson for Krafton, Striking Distance’s parent company, gave the following statement to IGN: \n“Striking Distance Studios and Krafton have implemented strategic changes that realign the studio’s priorities to better position its current and future projects for success. Unfortunately, these changes have impacted 32 employees. Honoring the invaluable contributions of each departing team member with material support in the form of outplacement services and meaningful severance packages is our top priority during this difficult moment.”\nStriking Distance was founded in 2019 by Dead Space co-creator Glen Schofield alongside industry veterans. The Callisto Protocol was its first title, released in December 2022. Set in a prison on Jupiter’s moon of Callisto in 2320, it follows an inmate’s escape following an alien outbreak. The game received a mixed reception from critics and players; we scored it a 6 out of 10 in our review. It was reported in January that The Callisto Protocol underperformed in sales compared to its reportedly massive budget. \nThe Callisto Protocol’s story expansion, Final Transmission, was released on June 28.  \n[Source: IGN]",

This aligns with a recent Modern Warfare II Season 5 blog post, which announced that the next Call of Duty would be revealed in-game through a “special event.” \nIt seems that reveal is happening next week, although when or how remains unclear.

However, many of those titles offer freeform experiences where more purpose-driven players may struggle with having to make their own fun. Palia aims to satisfy both crowds by tossing dozens of players into a fleshed-out fantasy world to build a life while also embarking on an epic quest. I made a new life for myself within developer Singularity 6’s upcoming free-to-play life sim MMO.

Survivor launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC earlier this year, in April, and received critical acclaim – Game Informer gave it a 9.25, making it a must-play game. But it skipped the PS4 and Xbox One generation that its predecessor, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, launched on. \n\n\n“Thanks to the strength of this legendary franchise and community demand, our development team has committed to bringing this Jedi experience to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,” Wilson said during the call, according to The Verge. \nFallen Order launched on PS4 and Xbox One with some technical difficulties, and while Survivor wasn’t perfect on that front, it performed a lot better on the now current-gen hardware. It will be interesting to see how it performs on the previous-gen hardware that Fallen Order had difficulties with. As for when to expect this Survivor port, it sounds like it could be a while because IGN reports that Wilson said the port is “in the early stages of development.” \nWhile waiting for it to hit PS4 and Xbox One one day, read Game Informer’s Star Wars Jedi: Survivor review and then read about how the game’s director wants the series to be a trilogy. Watch our video interview with Cal Kestis actor Cameron Monaghan about the sequel after that. \n[Source: The Verge]\nAre you waiting to play Star Wars Jedi: Survivor on PS4 or Xbox One?

Mitchell enlisted several others to the studio for its leadership with experience at Double Fine, Valve, Naughty Dog, Riot Games, and Blizzard Entertainment. Now, the studio has more than four dozen employees and is hard at work developing a shooter it hopes has 10,000 hours of depth and fosters incredible communities and lasting friendships. \nWhile its first game remains unannounced technically, Mountaintop tweeted a short teaser today with the caption, “Soon.” Hopefully, we will get more information about the game soon because this teaser looks interesting. Check it out for yourself below: \nSoon. pic.twitter.com/vEWhnFPsTb\nAugust 1, 2023\nAs you can see, the video teases some of the characters and locales of the game, all of which look pretty comic book-y, with a very stylized aesthetic.

It’s a world where players can build a legacy through teamwork and competition.” \n\nWe’ll watch for more information on Mountaintop’s first game and update you on Game Informer. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's list of the top 10 shooters to play right now and then check out our top scoring reviews of 2023. \nWhat do you think of the game’s teaser?

Nintendo wants to avoid the stock shortages that plagued the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S release for months (and years for some). \n\n\nThe publication reports that two of its sources suggest the next-generation console will use LCD screens, like those seen on the launch versions of the Switch, rather than the OLED screens used in the Switch OLED models. The use of LCD reduces costs, VGC writes, in light of the likely need for significantly more storage than what’s in the Switch, which will increase costs. \nVGC’s sources also suggest Nintendo’s next console will be playable on the go, similar to the Switch’s console-handheld hybrid nature. Its sources also say the console will continue using physical cartridges like the Switch, although it’s unclear if this console will be backwards compatible with the Switch.\nIn February of last year, Nintendo said the Switch was in the middle of its lifecycle, meaning that while a new Nintendo console might launch next year, the company might not necessarily abandon the Switch any time soon. However, if Nintendo continues support of the Switch alongside a next-gen console, it’s unclear how that will work as, presumably, this new console will be a good bit more powerful than the Switch. \nRegardless of how Nintendo approaches Switch support following the release of a new console and backwards compatibility, the Super Mario Bros. maker likely wants to convert the Switch’s massive install base into its following product. \n[Source: VideoGamesChronicle]\nWhat do you want from a next-gen Nintendo console?

The Xbox version of Final Fantasy XIV is expected sometime during the spring of 2024. Before the release of 7.0 and during Patch 6.5X, there will be an open beta scheduled for the Xbox version. \nThis means the Dawntrail expansion will be playable on Xbox Series X/S at launch. Like with other platforms, Final Fantasy XIV will only be available as a digital release on Xbox. You can go straight from the Open Beta to the full version, too, as saved data and progress transfer over. \nFor more about Final Fantasy XIV, watch the reveal trailer for Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail and then read Game Informer's Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker review. \nAre you going to be checking out Final Fantasy XIV on Xbox Series X/S?

Shortly after the reveal, director Naoki Yoshida took the stage to discuss the expansion as part of the Fan Festival’s keynote presentation. \nCheck out the Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail expansion trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nYoshida says the logo art for Dawntrail was created by Yoshitaka Amano using the color gold, which is the theme color of this expansion. You can check out the Dawntrail logo below:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            \n\n\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking to the story, Yoshida says, “We want to bring the very best summer vacation a hero could possibly have” to the Warriors of Light (the players). Without spoiling the events of 2021’s Endwalker expansion, Yoshida says Dawntrail is a significant shift from the previous expansion. Where Endwalker was dark, with the end of the universe on the line, Dawntrail is brighter and seemingly lighter in tone. \n“It’s a new beginning of Final Fantasy XIV [and] the theme is a journey of discovery. As you know, the arc we’ve been on from 1.0 to Endwalker about Hydaelyn and Zodiark has concluded. So you can think of this as our first step into a new story for Final Fantasy XIV.”\nFor more about Dawntrail, head to Game Informer's story featuring everything you need to know about the expansion. \nStory in development...\nWhat do you think of the Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail trailer?

          "description": "Sony Interactive Entertainment has revealed the PlayStation 5 has surpassed 40 million units sold. \nSony launched the PS5 in November 2020, after revealing the console the year prior, and since then, more than 40 million consoles have been purchased by players. In February, the console maker announced it had shipped 32 million units in the PS5’s lifetime, which means in just five months, Sony has sold at least 8 million more consoles. \n\n\nThat’s a significant jump, especially given that it’s been somewhat of a quieter year for Sony so far. There’s no doubt the release of God of War Ragnarok last winter pushed PS5 sales, helping it reach that 32 million mark, but since then, the only first-party PlayStation release for PS5 has been Horizon Forbidden West’s Burning Shores DLC and MLB The Show 23. Horizon Call of the Mountain is also a first-party game released this year but it's exclusive to PSVR2.\nHowever, Square Enix released Final Fantasy XVI last month exclusively on PS5, so while not a first-party game, it likely further pushed console sales. Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, which is getting its own special limited edition PS5 console bundle, will likely lead to more hardware sales as well.\n\n\nSEI President and CEO Jim Ryan discusses this milestone marker for the PS5 in a new statement released today. Below is a portion of it: \n\n\nFor more, read Game Informer’s PlayStation 5 review to find out why we love the console, and then check out Game Informer’s list of the top 10 best PS5 games after that. \nDo you have a PS5?

          "description": "Subscribers to Nintendo Switch Online can now access two of the most beloved Game Boy Color games of all time. The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages and The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons join the roster of playable classic games as part of the Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy catalog. \nAs was true with the original Game Boy Color cartridges, you can experience the games on their own in any order that you wish, but if you link them together through a password system, some characters and enemies will change, some items can be upgraded, and you can take part in the climactic final battle. It's also worth noting that these games served as Hidemaro Fujibayashi's directorial debut within the Legend of Zelda franchise. Fujibayashi would go on to direct The Minish Cap, Skyward Sword, Breath of the Wild, and Tears of the Kingdom.\nThe Nintendo Switch has steadily become one of the best places to experience the Legend of Zelda series. From Switch releases like Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom, and the Link's Awakening remake to nearly every classic Zelda game available through Nintendo Switch Online and its Expansion Pack, Zelda fans can enjoy nearly every beloved mainline entry – though Wind Waker and Twilight Princess remain conspicuously absent. However, with the Oracle games now available, fans of Link and his adventures have two more easy-to-access adventures on Nintendo's massively successful hybrid system.\nTo see where the Oracle games fall on the list of every mainline Zelda, head to our rankings here.",

          "description": "A little while has passed since the release of 2.7.0, and we are now excited to present you with the bugfix release 2.7.1.\nWe have included a significant amount of fixes and small improvements, in particular:\nAdded ScummVM Log file viewer, so you can easily report the problems on platforms with limited file access, e.g. Android, iOS or even modern Windows.\nFixed the shader-based scaler loading on some platforms.\nAdded multiple improvements to AGI, AGS, Cryomni3D and 12 more engines.\nWe also improved the detection of Broken Sword 1 & Broken Sword 2, so more original versions get properly detected. Thank you to those who submitted bug reports about this, and if you still locate a version that is not recognised, please report it to us (beware that the frankenstein versions that are floating around the internet will not be accepted, only those copied from the original media).\nFor the full and comprehensive list of notable changes, please refer to the Release Notes.\nIf you are as excited about the release as we are, you can share our joy by downloading it from our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS, or either of the Ubuntu Snap or Flatpack packages, the autoupdater will pick up the ScummVM 2.7.1 release automatically. For our Android app users, the update will be available on the Play Store.\nThank you very much for your continued support. Enjoy!\n>",

          "description": "Adibou, the first game in the beloved children's series, is now ready for public testing!\nAlso known as Adi Jr.'s World of Discoveries, this 1991 Coktel Vision title began the educational Adibou collection aimed at children of age 4 to 7 years.\nMany of the iconic activities and mechanisms of the series were already part of this first opus: planting flowers, playing the game Breakout, and being rewarded with sweets upon completing Read/Count exercises. And of course, this was Adibou's first appearance! Although the floppy release has him speak the same strange gibberish as heard in the Goblins series, he is still the patient and funny learning partner that he's remembered for being in later games.\nScummVM supports all of the game's releases, from the initial 16-color floppy ones to later 1994 CD versions with richer graphics and sound effects. So dig out your dusty Adibou disks, get a ScummVM daily development build, and start collecting sweets while completing math and reading exercises! Please also contact us if you own a version ScummVM is not yet aware of, and report to the issue tracker any problem you may encounter.\nAs much as ScummVM aims to replicate the original gaming experience, there is one feature we are unfortunately unable to support. When hardworking children complete their virtual sweets collection, a message invites them to mail a floppy disk with their savegame to Coktel Vision, who would send them a parcel containing Coktel goodies and actual sweets! So if you are introducing children to Adibou through ScummVM, be prepared to go to the nearest shop and buy some candy for when they finish the game!\n>",
