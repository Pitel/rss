As the father of the Final Fantasy franchise, he's the mind behind one of the most successful and popular JRPG series of all time. With FANTASIAN Neo Dimension reuniting Sakaguchi-san with Square Enix, he's spoken about how returning to his former studio — and to Nintendo consoles — feels like coming home.\nIn an interview with Famitsu (shared via My Nintendo News and Genki), Sakaguchi and Creative Studio III and Final Fantasy XIV and XVI producer Naoki Yoshida (known as Yoshi-P) sat down to discuss the upcoming expanded rerelease of the Apple Arcade title. And in the chat, Sakaguchi got a little reminiscent about his time with Square and developing games for Nintendo consoles.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Here comes the Sun.\nDespite the energetic title of this collection, the legendary Japanese development house Sunsoft never really went away. It's been steadily cranking out original titles, ports, and remasters on arcade and console since 1978, although it will likely never recapture the glory days of the 8- and 16-bit era. So prolific was its output that anyone who owned an NES or a SNES will have likely had multiple Sunsoft games in their collection. This Sunsoft is Back! bundle presents three titles released for the first time outside of Japan, beautifully emulated, and boasting a full English translation.\nFirst up is the fantastically titled Firework Thrower Kantaro's 53 Stations of the Tokaido. Playing as the titular explosive merchant, you must reach your fiancée in Edo, beset on all sides by a rival merchant's mercenary band. Kantaro’s adventure is a fun scrolling platformer of sorts, which has you dealing with tricky projectile-throwing arcs against enemies that bounce all over the place. Nailing a good shot against an approaching ninja is satisfying, but overall this one is a bit simplistic.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Yesterday's patch seems to target the worst of these bugs, and the dev team promise there are more fixes are to come.\nRead more",

It wasn't that I fell out of love with the idea, just that I can't physically do it.\" That was then and this, thankfully, is now.

Ubiquitous wearable sci-fi shields repel any attack that comes in too fast, so everyone has to learn this unique, overtly dance-like form of close-quarters combat where every thrust and parry is necessarily slow and considered. Picture it: careful judgments of your movements, weighing up the right time to strike, every measured jab part of a wider strategy that culminates in the kill.\nMOBAs are like that. Both in the fights themselves, sort of, where probing lunges lead up to bursts of lethality, but more broadly in each match as a whole. They’re map-wide knife fights, where a thrust is a well-judged lane push and a parry a savvy item buy. At first, playing Smite 2 felt akin to watching on helplessly as my opponents repeatedly shoved their crysknives through my ribs. After 30 hours, it often still feels like that - but I am enjoying myself. Mostly. Despite Valve’s third-person elephant in the lane. \nRead more",

While approaches to 4X and grand strategy vary hugely between games, factions and players, the genre as a whole is firmly wedded to imperial conquest, both structurally and at the level of narrative aspects and set-dressing. Many 4X games are triumphal re-enactments of specific periods of colonial settlement and expansion. All of which is to say that Syphilisation is fascinating.

          "description": "It's been 13 years since the first Space Marine came out. While it wasn't outstanding in the grander landscape of gaming, enough Warhammer 40K fans seem to have cherished the escapades of bulky blue boltgunner Demetrian Titus for the action game to merit a sequel a decade later. It left its story on something of a cliffhanger, with said hero being dragged away to face untold tortures by the Inquisition, the most zealous sect of this preternaturally paranoid sci-fi universe. Today, Titus is free again. Free to stomp towards hordes of alien foes, blast them with a plasma incinerator, and shred the stragglers with a chainsaw sword. Space Marine 2 is an often-satisfying scrapper that has me  convinced of 40K's merit as a crafting ground for excellent-looking environments and creatures, even if I'm not particularly moved by the bland character of Titus and his fellow Ultramarines.\nRead more",

          "description": "In the first post for my series on \"saving\" open world design, I complained that many of today's open worlds feel like checklists of formulaic tasks and rewards, their geography a vaporous staging ground for itemisable, cycling content-gathering opportunities, which flies in the face of the sense of freedom and wonder they're supposed to inspire. My interviewees, Elder Scrolls veterans Matt Firor and Nate Purkeypile, argued that this reflects the expense and scale of today's open world productions, which constrains experimental design both at a practical level and in terms of overall direction.\nCD Projekt open world designer Jakub Tomczak doesn't, as far as I know, have an answer to the issue of production bloat, but he does have a disarmingly obvious solution to the 'checklist problem', based on his time creating missions for Cyberpunk 2077 and its Phantom Liberty expansion: get better at hiding the checklist. Weave it into the landscape and setting more artfully, with an elegant balance of randomisation and responsiveness to the player's behaviour which keeps everything fresh. \r\n\n \nRead more",

It was a copy of The Game of Life, possibly the least exciting board game a child can win.\nThe game was dog water, and there’s probably a lesson in there somewhere about how cool and good it is to whine until you get free things, but we don’t have time for that. Instead, I’d like to draw your attention to Floops Big House Adventure. It’s a grungy, slimy, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters meets Ren and Stimpy Saturday morning shooter.

The game was a bright spot in a bad time, which might seem peculiar given that Sluggish Morss often looks like a whale's upset stomach, but it's such a feverishly inventive creation. It blew the dust from my synapses.\nThe same appears true of King-Spooner's upcoming Judero, on which he is collaborating with Soul Searching developer Talha Kaya. It casts you as a \"pagan seer\" armed with a big stick, who is searching the mythical Scottish borderlands for evil creatures to clobber. It looks cheerier and airier than Sluggish Morss, with a more overt emphasis on mechanics such as combat, but it has the same pickled 3am energy to it.

It also contains the words “bloody” and “arse” in quick succession, though thankfully not next to each other. The only piles are the logs Sid’s crouched behind as he prepares to sneak up to a cable car guarded by Nazis. That is the only haemorrhoids allusion I will ever make on this website. Until the next time I have to write about Andrew Wilson.\n“Oil just use my trusty knoife” mutters Sid as I take down my first guard. Straight away, the animation and noise indicators evoke the same Shadow Tactics or Desperados III goodness you’re probably expecting. Fine with me - that’s exactly what I’m here for.

As several of you identified, this seemed like an odd comparison when Spice Maureen 2 specifically plans to charge for comparable cosmetics, although I imagine Willits was referencing the “packs” that his space game’s baubles come in. “Our fans never thought we ripped them off in World War Z,” he said, comparing Space Marine 2’s optional spendables to that game.\nWhether you see the cosmetic's pricing as egregious or not, yesterday’s roadmap does look to make good on Saber’s promise to keep wearables and playables separate.

          "description": "Almost a decade after his acrimonious departure from Konami, the shadow of Hideo Kojima still looms over Metal Gear Solid. He's there, barely camouflaged, in the undergrowth of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - a remake of the fifth Metal Gear game, originally released in 2004, which tells the tale of a lone US special operator hunting superweapons and old mentors in the jungles of the southern Soviet Union. \r\n\n\r\nI say \"remake\" but this feels more like a re-release, in spirit. True, it now runs on Unreal Engine, with the option of a manual, third-person perspective and cover-shooter controls in addition to the old top-down viewpoints. Yes, it boasts new flourishes, such as wounds now leaving scars, and clothes picking up stray leaves. Yes, there's a new interface with floating in-world menus, which makes shuffling between the layers a bit less awkward. It's the product of much labour, with development split between Konami and external support partner Virtuos. But where Konami's other big restoration project, Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake, is a creative dialogue with the original game, Delta seems consumed by faithfulness to Kojima's original design.\r\n\n \nRead more",

(It came out in 1997, and as such, I think the statute of limitations on spoilers has passed, but if you still intend to play, stop reading now.) The mission completes the long arc of foreshadowing begun by the intro's mention that capital-class spacecraft have been outlawed, following a ruinous war. It turns out that one particular evil corpo has been sneakily building one of these megaships - not only that, but you get to fly inside it, cannons ablazing. It was while doing so that teenage me realised the true exceptionality of the Video Game Artform. You can't fly inside capital ships in, like, symbolist poems or baroque symphonies, can you? You can't fly in poems or symphonies at all, unless you do so metaphorically - \"metaphor\" being a kind of poor man's graphics card.\nThe technology of flight simming has advanced mightily since G-Police's day. For instance: in Everspace 2's just-announced Titans DLC, you get to fly inside not just regular old spaceships, but massive space kaiju with procedurally generated digestive systems.

You can, quite literally, go on tours curated by historians around each of the game's respective maps. Instead of diving off a Sphinx and plunging your hidden blade into someone's spinal column, you can look up at the Sphinx and read a paragraph on its significance. Maybe view an actual, real life bit of ancient Egypt from an actual real life museum collection in-game. Perhaps embody an Anglo-Saxon lad in Valhalla, instead, and like, cook up some nettle soup having just got a fresh \"Friar Tuck\" at the local hair choppers (no guarantees on this last bit).\nThis is all to say that Black Myth: Wukong deserves such a mode, too. There were so many times throughout my review time where I stopped and stared and wondered as to something's meaning. Not only in the architecture, but in the characters, too. So here I am with a proposition: how about instead of thwacking things with my staff, I can use it as a walking stick and point it at things I want to learn about.\nRead more",

Still, I was mildly bemused to learn that Mars Attracts, coming sometime next year, is the film’s first licensed game.

Cowboys? Sure. Wizards? Why not. It barely matters, as long as it results in some good puns. As a studio, Thunderful have a reputation for hopping from one style of game to the next, boiling entire genres down to their essence, and reconstituting them with competence and style to exist within a now-familiar steampunk world of colourful pals and Saturday morning cartoon jokes. The studio is a perpetual notion machine. Yes, with SteamWorld Heist 2, they're revisiting the sci-fi bullet-bouncing of their 2016 tactics game SteamWorld Heist, but they're also introducing significant changes to create a compulsive XCOM-like full of sea-faring submariners that may be their best work yet, even against a back catalogue of blinders. \nRead more",

You're able to take on challenges to earn bonus XP and rewards for completing the Shadow Briefing mission in time. Here's where you can find all of the Fortnite Shadow Briefing Locations in Chapter 5 Season 4.\n\n\n\n\n\nShadow Briefing Locations in Chapter 5 Season 4\n\n\nIn Chapter 5 Season 4, there are 26 total Shadow Briefing spawn locations in Fortnite. It's important to keep in mind that the Shadow Briefing terminal won't spawn at all of these locations each match. Instead, a handful of these locations, typically about 10, will spawn the Shadow Briefing terminals, in a rotation that randomizes each time. It's typically helpful to keep the map up so each match you can look in nearby areas until you learn where they can all spawn. Here are all the Fortnite Shadow Briefing Locations in Chapter 5 Season 4:\n\n\n\nNortheast of Rebel's Roost\n\n\nCatcher's Cove\n\n\nDoom's Courtyard\n\n\nLatverian Station\n\n\nCastle Doom\n\n\nThe Ol' Mill\n\n\nDoomstadt\n\n\nGrim Gate\n\n\nNorth of Charon's Crossing\n\n\nRestored REels\n\n\nReckless Railways\n\n\nGrand Glacier\n\n\nDumpenhausen\n\n\nThe Raft\n\n\nSoutheast of The Raft\n\n\nCoastal Columns\n\n\nShip It!

There are several quests tied to the locations of the Shadow Briefings, so make sure you do them before the locations once again change with the start of the new season. They are typically scattered across the map, so usually, you can find one in close proximity regardless of where you drop, but because of the randomization that's never guaranteed.\n\nThe post All Fortnite Shadow Briefing Locations in Chapter 5 Season 4 appeared first on Destructoid.",

While I wouldn’t recommend eating raw Salmon at any point, if you’re in a pinch, it can provide you with 500 energy. If you want to make a quick buck, you can also sell Salmon to Goofy for 150 Star Coins each. \n\n\nQuests\n\n\nThere are two quests which require Salmon to complete:\n\n\nQuest\nVillager\nObjective\n\n\nA Place for Joy\nOlaf’s level 2 friendship quest\nDeliver three Salmon to Olaf\n\n\nFishing for Precision\nMulan’s unlock quest line\nCatch 10 Salmon and place them in the camp cauldron\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCritters\n\n\nWhile it isn’t a loved gift for any of the critters in the Valley, it is a liked gift for the foxes in the Frosted Heights.

Well, that’s out on September 26.\n\n\nIf you haven’t played it, Night Slashers is a solid beat-’em-up. It has the melty, goopy gore of Splatterhouse and the combat of… Um, I was going to say Final Fight, but it’s a lot looser than that. The Konami X-Men arcade game, maybe. It’s a nice mashy time. It was also available digitally last year from Johnny Turbo’s Arcade, but it got delisted.\n\n\n\n\nI hope this remake isn’t the reason. I don’t mean to be dismissive – it has a decent art style, and it adds some additional features – but part of Night Slashers’ appeal was its pixel art style. It was a good-looking game for the time, and its graphics hold up. As much as the modernized art looks fine, it still takes away from the original.\n\n\nOn the other hand, it now supports four players instead of just three. This is enabled by a new character lifted from 1993’s Fighter's History, Liu Feilin. She’s cool, but kind of a disappointing pick. Hong Hua Zhao is already a female Chinese martial artist. So, now we have a cyborg dude, a waiter, and two female Chinese martial artists. I’m sure they control differently and have their own strengths, but diversity, please.\n\n\nOn top of that are some custom modes and modifiers that you can wrap into the experience. The original is a solid game, and the remake looks competently done. It’s $9.99 USD, which seems more than reasonable. Just hard to get excited about.\n\n\nNight Slashers: Remake is coming to Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC September 26, 2024.\n\nThe post That Night Slashers Remake launches this month if you’re into that sort of thing appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "In WoW: The War Within, the easiest way to make the best items in the game is to use Concentration to do it. However, this newly added crafting resource is very limited in how much you can use, so the question becomes: how do you get more of it?\n\n\nHow to recharge Concentration in WoW: The War Within\n\n\nConcentration was added to The War Within as a replacement for the RNG mechanic tied to improving profession-related crafts in Dragonflight. The total profession overhaul that came with Dragonflight shaped the current system we have now, with Concentration being the most notable improvement to it.\n\n\nSo, how do you get more Concentration? The truth is that there is no known method for getting more Concentration by your efforts. Concentration is finite as a resource but recharges over time on its own. There's no way to speed this up, thus limiting the value and rarity of high-budget items a crafter can make at any given time. While this may be disappointing to read, there are benefits to it overall from a community perspective.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nAs just mentioned, no single crafter can always make the best items (at least not easily), which results in professions staying relevant significantly longer throughout the lifespan of an expansion. Dragonflight succeeded in doing this with its RNG-based system, but crafting items never felt great entirely dictated by how lucky you are. This is why the Concentration System was introduced.\n\n\nConcentration gives you, the crafter, more control over your actual crafts. You can determine when you want to throw all your efforts into an important craft without wasting time or resources. Since using the mechanic guarantees you the next rarity of a chosen item, you will always know what your output will be the moment you hit that 'craft' button.  \n\nThe post How to get more Concentration in WoW: The War Within appeared first on Destructoid.",
