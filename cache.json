          "description": "Super... duper... erm...\nFor a while now, we (and, we presume, many of you) have been referring to Nintendo’s inevitable Switch successor as the ‘Switch 2.’ It makes sense for now, right? After all, rumours, speculation, and educated guesses are all loosely pointing to the new console being an iterative evolution of the hybrid concept that we’ve all come to know and love. If Nintendo were likely to deviate (and make no mistake, there’s no telling exactly what the firm is truly up to), we’d likely just stick with ‘the new console’ or ‘Nintendo’s next-gen system.’ For simplicity, and until we know otherwise, 'Switch 2' will do.\nAssuming that it will be the iterative evolution that we’re all hoping for, though, what will it actually be called? As a brand, the Switch is undoubtedly one of the most instantly recognised and understood names in the company's history (certainly more so than ‘Wii U’, anyway), so it’s reasonable to assume that Nintendo probably won’t ditch the Switch branding.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Your passions being watching hours of anti-multi-level marketing (MLM) YouTube videos, which is the content hole I fell down over the Christmas break. Your weird uncles have at least seen a film before, but it's not like I can turn to my mum and ask her if she thinks the weird Monat Christians are worse than the Seint make-up TikTok girlies without explaining almost every word in the sentence.\nAnyway. My point is: someone should make an MLM simulation game.\nRead more",

          "description": "In the festively grim universe of Warhammer 40,000, space is sometimes racked by Warp storms – terrible cyclones of Chaos energy that have a catastrophic effect on imperial communications. One such storm hits the Koronus Expanse during the events of Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, erasing starcharts and obliging your character - a newly minted Rogue Trader, aka High Gothic Commander Shepard - to re-discover the systems and planets that make up your predecessor Theodora’s dominions, while gathering an entourage of indecently customisable warriors, and hunting down a series of badniks that include a mysterious Chaos cult. \r\n\n\r\nWarp storms sometimes have relativistic consequences. Voidship crews may be stranded for decades in transit: you will meet characters in this vast, brooding RPG who arrived at their destinations to find the battles they were sent to fight already passed into legend, the people they were sent to meet long since dead or departed. Something similar has happened to this review, which was supposed to be published in early December. Did I dramatically underestimate the amount of playtime involved, despite being told months in advance by developers Owlcat that Rogue Trader is well over 100 hours long? Nonsense. It’s all because of those pesky Chaos disruptions, you see. It’s Chaos that’s to blame.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The sort of secrets that make the game world feel huge and unknowable and transform the post-game into a scavenger hunt more akin to ARGs than classic secret endings. After 2021’s meta deckbuilder Inscryption, and enigmatic Zeldalike Tunic a year later, 2023 brought us Cocoon. Set in a cryptic world of insect-like aliens and their impossible machines, Cocoon is a puzzle game all about mystery.\nWhat best sells the mystery is a minority of puzzles that are so well-hidden, that a lot players might never know they exist. Those are the optional challenges that guard the way to Cocoon's secret ending. Any given player might stumble on one or two clues for those puzzles, before shrugging and finding their way back to the main story. But as the game goes on and the clues remain unresolved, those players will wonder what other secrets are hidden around them. I talked to Jeppe Carlsen and Edwin Kho from developer Geometric Interactive, to learn why those puzzles were made, and how it feels to watch a community track them down in real time.\nRead more",

New open world RPG Archaelund, which launched in early access this week, and was brought to my attention by RPS supporter cpt_freakout, has something of that curious enchantment to it.\nYou'll explore its landscape in first-person, roving sandy plateaus and frontier towns that remind me of Morrowind, at times.

          "description": "MSI are the latest gaming gear makers to unveil a Steam Deck-alike, announcing the Claw as part of their CES 2024 showcase. The Claw – great name, by the way – actually looks and sounds closer to the Asus ROG Ally than Valve’s handheld, being a Windows 11-based device without any flashy hardware tricks like the Lenovo Legion Go’s detachable controllers. All the same, it’s aiming to stand out among these portable PCs through two means: its engorged 53Whr battery, and the industry-first use of a 14th-gen Intel Core Ultra chip as its APU.\nRead more",

Until then, slimmer gaming laptops like the HP Omen Transcend 16 remain the closest approximation of that dream, cramming discrete GPUs – the Nvidia Geforce RTX 4060, in this case – into lighter, narrower chassis designs.\nThe usual catch with such devices, sadly, is an overeagerness to appear aspirational. Which is, to be clear, the nicest thing I can say about a Razer Blade 16 costing £2500 for its own RTX 4060 model. Despite the name, however, the Omen Transcend 16 is much more down to earth – it still offers enough premium trappings to feel like a step up from chunkier laptops, but at its current pricing of £1199 / $1429, it’s a fair trade as well. And it supports Nvidia DLSS 3, dash of futureproofing tech that might just soothe any worries about buying a 2023-spec PC in 2024.\nRead more",

          "description": "Over the Christmas holidays, I had very good intentions to finally tackle some of the big games from 2023. I still haven't played Resident Evil 4, System Shock, very much of Baldur's Gate 3 or Assassin's Creed Mirage, and I really wanted to play a bit of Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora. You know, just for a little look after the quite interesting preview I did back in October. Admittedly, I wasn't anywhere near my PC for at least one of the two weeks I had off, as I was away doing the inevitable family roulette of Christmas visiting. I also knew that, even if I had spent the whole time at home, there would be no way I'd finish or get through all of them. I knew I was sort of setting myself up to fail, but as I said. Good intentions. I did have my Steam Deck with me, after all, and even went to the trouble of loading it up with around 50 games, including some of those biggies that I have on Steam. \nWhat did I actually end up playing though? Teeny games. Six of 'em, which were all four to six hours long. And some of them I didn't even enjoy very much! Why? Why do I do this? In some respects I'm pleased I managed to clear a bit more of my backlog, but man alive, I always fall into exactly the same trap. I play the shorties, and always leave the biggies, like I'm allergic to anything over four hours - and I don't like it.\nRead more",

Spider-themed snipers and six-gun slinging cowboys share space with winged angelic healers and a talking gorilla with a Tesla cannon -  characters who reward positioning and timely ability usage just as much as one’s ability to click on heads. When the game went free to play and slapped a 2 on the end in 2022, it got a more muted reception, but the dev team have displayed a great willingness to experiment. In fact, there's never been a better time to give Overwatch 2 a go.\nRead more",

It's a time for making plans, setting goals, thinking about all the cool new games I'll be playing over the next 12 months (while also looking nervously at the pile of games I missed over the last 12 months and placing them very, very gingerly on the teetering and totteringly tall pile of my backlog). And, of course, making some new year's resolutions. Traditionally, I don't often set myself too many resolutions - I always give myself a reading goal (35 books is what I'm aiming for this year), for example, but the rest I usually play pretty fast and loose with - more 'nice to haves' rather than 'musts', I'd say. \nThis year, though, I do have a few gaming-related resolutions on my list, and in discussing them with the rest of the RPS Treehouse, it turns out we all have some games-themed goals this year. So I thought it would be fun to share them with you all below. And if you've also made some gaming resolutions for 2024, tell us about them in the comments. We can hold ourselves accountable together, like that big curtain of eldritch eyeballs up there in the header from good game Norco. \nRead more",

Surprisingly goofy. Unsettling. But above all, a challenge. We walked back to our cars and tried - my mate was thrilled to have identified who Dave Bautista likely voiced in the dub (we watched sub) - to unpack what we saw.\nSince then, we've listened to podcasts, read interviews, and engaged in some back and forth. It's all brought me back to my uni days, where Dark Souls made me get my shovel out for the first time and mine the internet for meaning.

          "description": "Hideo Kojima's new Xbox Game Studios project OD is a horror game that is \"also a movie, and at the same time a new form of media\" and who knows, perhaps it also runs on solar power. That's the extremely direct and literal reading of Kojima's latest social media tease, in which he compares his latest endeavour to Boktai: The Sun Is In Your Hand, an isometric vampire-hunting game for Game Boy Advance, which Kojima worked on while at Konami in the early noughties. Boktai stands apart to this day for making use of solar energy. There's a sun sensor built into the cartridge, which allows you to re-energise your weapon by using the console in sunlight, though this isn't outright necessary to prevail.\nI doubt OD employs a similar peripheral, though a Steam Deck verified horror game that can only be played outdoors in pleasant weather would be an... interestingly contrary experience. But it's an opportunity, at least, to jump aboard one of my personal hobby horses and give you a scrappy rundown of older and recent games that employ similar functionality.\nRead more",

Katharine says it's decent, however, and the latest trailers are intriguing. One is an overview of the new metroidvania's locations, of which you can read much more in Katharine's last preview. The other is a quick dive into the game's approach to accessibility, which appears to be a lot more holistic than you'll find in many games. \r\n \nRead more",

But take Russian Roulette, swap the revolver for a pump-action shotgun, mix up live and dud rounds, and add Inscryption-esque items which let you change the rules, and now you have a more skillful game.

The good news is that everyone seems to be taking a bit of a breather in 2024, because (at time of writing at least) the official \"big'uns\" calendar is looking remarkably slim at the moment. There are still some heavy-hitters coming our way this year, such as , Star Wars Outlaws and Path Of Exile 2, but 2024 looks like another year where it will be the smaller, independent games that shine the brightest. They certainly make up the bulk of our most anticipated games list for 2024, which the RPS Treehouse has been feverishly putting together over the last few days. The bad news is that there are still loads of great games coming out. So come, join us, and see what's on our personal wishlists for 2024.  \nRead more",

I was previously a snob about the Nancy Drew point and click puzzle games, and then came to regret it when a fan of them (very nicely) emailed me explaining they're actually really good. We're going to find out for ourselves by playing them. There are north of 30 in total, and I will update the rankings at the end of each article.\nThe first is 1998's Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill, in which Nancy solves the murder of a Floridian highschooler named Jake Roberts, and there's a lot to love about it right away. There's a restrained cast, three locations in total, and the school sports team is called the Fighting Manatees. Thus the icon for the game is a lil' cartoon manatee - and to be absolutely accurate, this is the remastered version of the game from 2010, not the original 90s version.

Often if you see a \"quick crossword\" in a UK paper that means \"crossword with clues that are general knowledge questions and not an archaic set of riddles - you know, for if you're waiting for the kettle to boil, or are an idiot\".

          "description": "Tim Cain wrote what is perhaps gaming’s most famous and influential monologue: the introduction to Fallout. “War never changes,” he says. “People loved it. I’m like, ‘I must be a writer.’” Yet much more recently, when Cain sat down to write his memoirs, nobody really liked what came out on the page. “I was really, really bad at it,” he says. “I had half a dozen people read it, and they all pretty much said that the stories were good, but my writing wasn’t.”\r\n\n\r\nCain’s writing strengths, as fellow Fallout originator Leonard Boyarsky has suggested, lie in shortform. Which was bad news for anyone who wanted to read the definitive account of his four decades at the heart of Interplay, Troika and Obsidian, three of the most important RPG studios of all time. Thankfully, though, it turns out Cain is a natural raconteur. The same anecdotes that appeared flat and toneless in his memoirs go down a storm on YouTube. There, for the past seven months, Cain has been delivering his stories straight to camera, as if at a dinner party with 73,500 other people. “When I started the channel, I would effectively just look at something in the book and be like, ‘I’ll tell that story today,’” he says. “Now I spend as much time answering questions and doing videos based on things people ask about.” \r\n\n \nRead more",

We can expect the Maw's petulance to mount during January, a lean month for announcements and revelations, but there are a few tasty morsels in the offing - a new Prince of Persia and Tekken 8, for instance. Fingers crossed we can build up some kind of momentum.\nSome new game releases we are pointing our telescopes at this week: Skeleton Rebellion (4th Jan), a scrappy offbeat RPG with claymation elements in which you are a skeleton trying to overthrow some mages, and The Night Is Grey (5th Jan), a point-and-click adventure about a beardy bloke and a little girl stuck in the woods with some weirdo wolves. If you like, you can also play a free drinking game I've just invented in which you do a shot for every time I accidentally write 2023 instead of 2024.\n Read more",

One deal that caught our eye this morning is this deal on a Gigabyte RTX 4070 Windforce 3X OC model, which is down to £530.58 when bought from Amazon US via Amazon UK. \nThe deal price, which includes shipping and import duty, is significantly cheaper than UK-based options from major GPU makers which are in the £560 to £600 range. However, there are cheaper UK options if you're happy with a smaller, non-overclocked Palit card. Palit is more of a budget brand, but is built around the same Nvidia GPU and therefore offers the same performance. \nRead more",

Those who opt for all the bonuses will get the game along with a keychain, reversible cover, and a CD containing Machinae Supremacy's original soundtrack. Like the standard versions, the Deluxe Editions of both games are priced at €39.99, but these are exclusively up for pre-order at the Red Art Games website. \n\n\nHere's a look at both games in action:\n\n\n\n\nBeyond that, it sounds like Shmup Week has some more surprises waiting in the wings. Red Art Games teased an announcement \"coming straight from Japan\" for Thursday, January 11 at 5:00 p.m. CET. There's also the previously-delayed Shinorubi, which finally locked in a January 12 launch date from Red Art Games last month.

          "description": "Amper Software, the team behind Team Fortress: Source 2, and James Lambert, the dev working on Portal 64, have stated that they’re ending development of their fan projects following cease and desist demands from Valve.\n\n\nTeam Fortress: Source 2 was a fan project aiming to port Valve’s 2007 multiplayer shooter, Team Fortress 2, over to the newer Source 2 engine. While the team had paused development in September, they were hoping to resume at some point, but the DMCA has made that pause permanent.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Portal 64 is a project intended to demake 2007’s Portal to run on the Nintendo 64 hardware. Just a few days ago, the developer was celebrating the release of the game’s “First Slice,” which demonstrated the game's progress.\n\n\nThe Team Fortress: Source 2 takedown seems rather understandable since Valve still supports Team Fortress 2 and may one day want to port it or create a sequel themselves. The DMCA posted on the public GitHub page cites that their reasons are due to Valve’s own assets being used in a project, though that hasn’t stopped some other fan games based on their properties from being published and even sold on Steam.\n\n\nMeanwhile, James Lambert says that Valve has stated that they’ve requested Portal 64 to be taken down because “the project depends on Nintendo’s proprietary libraries.”\n\n\nThis is somewhat surprising since Valve has long supported fan endeavors based on their games, going as far as allowing them to be sold as retail products on Steam. Either this demonstrates a shift in the company’s policy toward such projects, or they actually have reasonable concerns toward these particular projects. Either way, it’s not a great look directly after their announced shift on their storefront policies in regards to AI.\n\nThe post Portal 64 and Team Fortress: Source 2 fan projects shut down after Valve DMCA appeared first on Destructoid.",

Usually by now we at least know the overall theme and title of the season, such as Season of the Malignant or Season of Blood. But for now, all we know are a few new features coming to Season 3.\n\n\nSince the release of Diablo 4, Season 3 has been the goal for when Leaderboards would be added to the ARPG. At BlizzCon 2023 a couple of months ago, Blizzard confirmed they would still be coming in Season 3. Other features teased at BlizzCon included a weekly challenge dungeon called The Gauntlet and something called the Hall of Ancients.\n\n\nHowever, we've got absolutely no new information regarding the theme of Season 3 or its new mechanics, which is often what a new season is all about. Leaderboards will be great but more importantly, the season has to introduce some new features and mechanics that will convince me to go through the time-consuming process of leveling a character for the fourth time. With the new season coming in less than two weeks, surely we can expect more details soon.\n\n\nDiablo 4 Season 3 starts on January 23.\n\n\n\nThe post Diablo 4 login screen confirms Season 3 will begin on January 23 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Now, Team Green is trying to gain a slight advantage by offering a chance to win one of said cards.\n\n\nYou all know how this works by now. As outlined in a recent post on Twitter, if you want to be in with a chance of getting hold of an RTX 4080 SUPER (the Founder Edition specifically), you'll need to comment with the relevant hashtag and like the Nvidia post.\n\n\n\n\nOh, also, it's been signed by company CEO Jensen Huang. So...that's a little something extra, I guess? The actual graphics card itself is due to release January 31, so Nvidia is evidently drumming up interest in this new variant of one of its most powerful Ada Lovelace products.\n\n\nOr alternatively...\n\n\nThis competition comes as part of the tech giant's appearance at CES 2024. As a result, if you happen to be at the event, you'll have an additional chance at winning the new 4080. A post on the Nvidia website says the winner of the signed GPU will also receive $500 in Steam gift cards.\n\n\nThe sweepstakes runs between now and 5 pm PT on January 12, so you only have a couple of days to enter. Remember, if you're at CES 2024, you can enter via Twitter and by visiting one of the event's select booths.\n\n\nThe winners will be announced on February 29. Check the official rules for more details on how to enter.\n\nThe post Nvidia is already giving you the chance to win an RTX 4080 SUPER appeared first on Destructoid.",

If you always wondered what it would be like to play Cool Spot on a train or ToeJam & Earl while in a post office queue, well wonder no more.\n\n\nAs reported by The Verge, a company called Hyperkin – a specialist in console hardware and accessories – is working on a portable Sega Genesis device. Dubbed the Mega 95, the system is said to be compatible with the original cartridges.\n\n\nImage via The Verge.\n\n\nThe report goes on to say that it'll feature a five-inch screen, the ability to switch between 4:3 and 16:9 aspect ratios, up to 10 hours of battery life, and there's even a USB-C dock so it can be hooked up to a TV.\n\n\nOr Sonic the Hedgehog on an actual green hill\n\n\nTaking a look at the images, we can see the Mega 95 dock has two controller ports, which resemble the serial connections from the OG Genesis (which we called the Mega Drive, here in the UK).\n\n\nThe fact that it's meant to support the official cartridges will be a huge selling point from a nostalgia point of view. This means it's probably not going to be using emulation, so you'll get to relive the classics as they were intended, such as Streets of Rage 2, which we all know is the greatest game ever made (I will fight you over this).\n\n\nAt the moment, there's no release date for the device. Nor is there a price. However, it is another means by which we can play our games on the go. Especially for those of us who miss the glory days of Sega, iconic Saturday morning cartoons, and highly flammable shell suits.

While the 2004 game still holds up visually, a team of modders has been hard at work giving Valve's classic a bit of a spit-shine.\n\n\nAt CES 2024, the Half-Life 2 RTX Remix project released a new trailer, showing the work that's so far gone into the Nvidia-powered graphical improvement. In this instance, we get to see what Ravenholm looks like in all its shiny glory.\n\n\n\n\nIt's an impressive mod, with the comparisons in the video showing the difference between the OG game and the RTX remix. We get a glimpse of all that lovely ray tracing, DLSS 3.5 image upscaling, and remastered assets. Ooh...ahh, etc.\n\n\nSuch moody lighting\n\n\nRavenholm is one of the most notorious sections in Half-Life 2. Something of a gear shift, this part of the story turns the game into a creepy horror that takes place in an abandoned mining town. It's where we meet Father Grigori and also get to see the destructive power of the gravity gun when you add in a rusty saw blade.\n\n\nAs for when the RTX project will be available, there doesn't seem to be a release date yet. However, according to the Nvidia website, the open beta for the RTX Remix toolkit begins January 22. Maybe that's when we'll get to play it, or at least get an update on when this boosted version of HL2 will be available.\n\n\nIn the meantime, there's Portal RTX to check out if you want to go \"ooh\" and \"ahh\" at a different Valve game for a bit.\n\nThe post Half-Life 2 RTX project shows off a shiny Ravenholm in new trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

We already saw significant layoffs at Twitch last year, and now there's even more grim news ahead, as the Amazon-owned platform is letting 35% of its staff go.\n\n\n\nA recent report from Bloomberg says Twitch is due to lose around 500 of its workforce. This news was originally sourced from people who are \"familiar with the plans.\"\n\n\nSince this report, the company has issued a statement about the layoffs. A recent blog post acknowledges the \"difficult decision\" Twitch had to make, in which there will be a reduction in the \"size of our workforce.\" It also confirms the number of job losses will be 500.\n\n\nAdding to this, CEO Dan Clancy says there will be a livestream going ahead on Thursday, January 11 at 1 pm PT for those who have questions. There's also a section that addresses those who feel the decision will affect their role. Those who are not affected will still be sent an email from Clancy.\n\n\n\n\nWhen will it end?\n\n\nThis also comes just shortly after Unity announced it was laying off 25% of its staff, which accounts for around 1,800 jobs. Indeed, this latest developer from Twitch could set another precedent – carrying on from 2023 – in terms of job uncertainty in the video game and adjacent industries.\n\n\nWe already experienced a ton of job losses last year, with thousands of employees being let go from otherwise lucrative development houses and publishers. Worse still, entire studios – such as TimeSplitters outlet Free Radical Design – had their doors closed for good.\n\n\n\nWe're only into the second week of the new year, and things are not looking good for those employed in video games. This is all in spite of the fact that the industry at large saw rising profits in 2023, according to data from Statista. \n\n\nHopefully, there'll be something on the horizon quickly for the hundreds at Twitch that are affected by the decision.\n\nThe post Twitch cutting 35% of its workforce, company issues statement appeared first on Destructoid.",

Now, 22 years later, there’s a free fan-made mod called Portal: Revolution that perfectly re-captures the joy of the game, albeit with the sad omission of a much-loved character.\n\n\nReleased on January 6 2024, Portal: Revolution—developed by Second Face Software—has received positive reviews on Steam. Over 3,000 people have reviewed the mod at the time of this writing, and 94% of those are positive. \n\n\nOne of the reviewers on Steam likened it to the scene in Ratatouille where the chef eats something made by the rat and has a flashback to a heartwarming childhood memory. They’re right, too. \n\n\nImage via Second Face Software\n\n\nThe game add-on offers eight hours of exclusive gameplay, voice acting that perfectly captures the humor of the original game and challenging levels to work through. Promising to pick up in terms of difficulty where the original Portal 2 left off, there really is some challenge to work through.\n\n\nSadly, the add-on takes place after the demise of GLaDOS, so we’re without her dark sense of humor. But with so much on offer, we can’t hold that against the developers. \n\n\nAs well as taking the difficulty of puzzles up a notch, the developers have also introduced some new elements to gameplay. There’s a new variant of laser cube and field that cleanses gel. Second Face Software have also resurrected a feature that was removed during development of the original Portal 2: \"Pneumatic Diversity Vents.\"\n\n\nImage via Second Face Software\n\n\nPortal: Revolution is available now on Steam for free and you can play it as long as you have a copy of Portal 2 downloaded to your steam account. \n\nThe post Portal: Revolution is a free fan-made mod that’s picking up steam appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Announced at CES, Hyperkin has revealed the next in their line of retro Xbox controllers for modern hardware. This time around they’ll be recreating the form factor of the Xbox Controller S, which was the revision of the original Xbox’s rather beefy handpiece.\n\n\nThe original controller that shipped with the OG Xbox was rather divisive. It was rather bulky and rather unwieldy, even if you had big hands. This was apparently due to difficulties with the manufacturer of the controller’s PCB, but most players at the time only saw a giant controller where most of the facial real estate was taken up by a humungous logo. The controller was nicknamed “The Duke” (I actually remember hearing this moniker during the console’s lifespan) and was eventually replaced by the less massive Controller S. Apparently, some people have some love for the original monstrosity since Hyperkin recreated that one first, followed by the Xbox 360's controller.\n\n\nHyperkin’s new creation, cleverly named DuchesS, is made to work with PC and Xbox Series X|S. It has modern features like a share button and a headphone jack. Perhaps most importantly, it uses Hall Effect joysticks and analog triggers. The early images shared by Hyperkin show off white and black variations. Unfortunately, there hasn’t yet been a translucent “crystal” version announced.\n\n\nI don’t have a tremendous amount of nostalgia for the Controller S, but I always love seeing retro controller recreations. I’ve certainly got enough based on the SNES and Genesis/Mega Drive lying around. I think if I had one wish for the controller, it would be that it could work with the OG Xbox. I always appreciate fancier controllers for old hardware.\n\n\nThere is no release date or price stated for the Hyperkin DuchesS.\n\nThe post The Hyperkin DuchesS is bringing back the more tolerable original Xbox controller appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "PlayStation 5 owners are one of the few who have yet to be able to get their hands on Sam Barlow's interactive movie title, Immortality. But their wait is finally over, as Immortality splices onto PS5 on January 23.\n\n\nThe news came within an announcement trailer from Barlow's Half Mermaid Productions. The trailer gives a brief idea of how the game's unique \"match cut\" feature works and teases the project's supernatural story.\n\n\n\n\nInitially released for PC and Xbox Series X|S in August 2022, Immortality was met with glowing reviews from many outlets. Destructoid's Eric Van Allen classified it as \"superb\" in our review. \n\n\nImmortality's story revolves around the actress Marissa Marcel and the three films she starred in but were never released. The player uses behind-the-scene footage to jump between movies, matching shots of faces or objects to jump to a similar take in a different film. The more you interact with the game's clips, the more you begin to unravel and understand the title's dark and mysterious plot.\n\n\nOutside of reviews, Immortality also cleaned up during award season. The project was nominated across numerous outlets for Best Performance, Best Story, Best Game Direction, and Best Game. Manon Gage, the lead actress who portrayed Marissa Marcel, came home with hardware at the 2022 Golden Joystick Awards for Best Performer. Gage also won the 2022 New York Game Award for Best Acting in a Game.\n\n\nPlayStation 5 owners should be excited to have such a unique title become part of the console's catalog when Immortality launches on PlayStation 5 on January 23. Immortality is currently playable on PC, Xbox Series X|S, mobile, and Mac. \n\nThe post Haunting FMV mystery Immortality comes to PS5 later this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Pocketpair has announced the date for the Early Access release of Palworld – the legally distinct Pokémon game with guns. It will launch on January 19. Accompanying the announcement is a new trailer.\n\n\nPalworld is an open-world crafting survival game that features monsters extremely reminiscent of Nintendo’s Pokémon series. The twist is that rather than tame them through friendship, you blast them with an array of firepower. You’ll also need to do some base building to keep your Pals a place to eat and rest.\n\n\n\n\nThe trailer shows off some other… uh, trainers, who wield some legally distinct Pokeballs. Palworld allows for up to 32 players. PVP battles are planned but won’t be in the initial Early Access launch.\n\n\nThe derivative nature of Palworld’s concept sort of undermines the weirdness of it. However, I have to admit that recent looks into it have looked pretty fun. With something like this, I’d almost expect the devs to quickly spit something out to capitalize on the novelty of the concept, but that doesn’t look like what’s going on here. The developer seems to be taking their time in developing it.\n\n\nOn the other hand, Pocketpair doesn’t exactly have the best track record, but that’s not always the whole story. I’m at least curious enough to try it.\n\n\nPalworld launches into Early Access on PC January 19, 2024.\n\nThe post Pokemon with guns game Palworld launches into Early Access January 19 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "We're just past the first week of the new year and it's all hands on deck for rivals Nvidia and AMD. With the former announcing three new RTX 4000 SUPER graphics cards, the latter was quick to unveil a boosted version of one of its current gen products.\n\n\nAnnounced at CES 2024, AMD is launching the Radeon RX 7600 XT, a somewhat enhanced version of the 7600 that released last May. While it's admittedly at the lower end of the 7000 series, the XT variant does offer 16 GM of VRAM, double what the non-XT version has.\n\n\n\n\nThis sort of puts it on par with the likes of the 7800 XT and 7900 GRE, but only in terms of memory size. However, this does mean it will at least be a cheaper choice than the more enthusiast models, starting at $329.\n\n\nHigher clock speeds as well\n\n\nThe double RAM is probably the biggest draw of the RX 7600 XT, but it offers other spec improvements as well. For example, it features boost clock speeds of up to 2755 MHz against the regular 7600's 2655 MHz.\n\n\nThe newer model will also have 22.57 TFLOPS. Compared to its predecessor's 21.75, it's another bit of extra juice for the XT variant.\n\n\nOutside that, I wouldn't expect a huge performance difference between the two. It's also said to use a bit more power, with a TDP of 190W (versus 165W). However, what you can expect is the RX 7600 XT to be available from January 24. If you are interested in it, that is.\n\nThe post Keeping up with Nvidia, AMD announces the RX 7600 XT appeared first on Destructoid.",

The eponymous wordsmith will be joining the game as a survivor.\n\n\nDead by Daylight was released back in 2016, and since then, it’s been piling on the crossover content. By now, they must be running out of things to crossover with. Recently, they introduced a survivor DLC that is just Nicholas Cage. Like, just the dude with a few different jackets. Eventually, maybe we’ll just be getting various unrelated celebrities. Orson Welles, perhaps? Columbo?\n\n\n\n\nBut for now, Alan Wake is a pretty decent fit. The tormented writer is no stranger to horror and, when he’s not at a typewriter, spends much of his time under duress. The trailer shows how he gets tied into the slasher playground of Dead by Daylight. By writing, of course. Live by the pen, die by the pen.\n\n\nIf you’re not familiar, Dead by Daylight is an asymmetrical multiplayer game where up to four players take the role of the survivors trying to escape, and one person is a slasher trying to carve them up. It has previously crossed over with properties like Alien, Silent Hill, and A Nightmare on Elm Street.\n\n\nAlan will first be available on Dead by Daylight's Public Test Build starting on January 10 at 11am EST. He’ll then be released for purchase on January 30.\n\nThe post Alan Wake is joining Dead by Daylight appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Literally a few days ago, there were heavy rumors and leaks suggesting MSI was about to unveil its own Steam Deck rival. Low and behold, it turned out to be true. Say hello to \"The Claw,\" a gaming device from the laptop manufacturer that's gunning for a slice of the handheld PC pie.\n\n\nMSI announced the item at CES 2024, with an expected release date around the first quarter of this year. We've already seen that companies such as ASUS and Lenovo can take on the Steam Deck, so perhaps there is more room for another competitor.\n\n\n\n\nAs for what The Claw will be packing, details on the MSI website show it'll feature an Intel Core Ultra 7 processor, along with an Intel Arc graphics chip. This is something of a departure, as the aforementioned alternatives (as well as the Deck) have opted for AMD architecture instead.\n\n\nGet a grip!\n\n\nSo how does it stack up against the Steam Deck? With a brand-new Intel processor compared to the Zen 2 – which launched in 2019 – we can expect The Claw to offer something a little nipper with its more up-to-date guts.\n\n\nIt also boasts a 1920x1080 touchscreen and a 52Whr battery life. Compared to the Deck's 1200x800 screen and 50Whr battery, the former could have a bit of an edge over the latter.\n\n\nHowever, with it running Windows 11, it could have a less intuitive mobile gaming operating system than SteamOS, which is specifically built to play games from a user's Steam library.\n\n\nOnly time will tell how it'll fare against Valve's OG offering, but it definitely looks like things are beginning to get crowded in the portable PC sphere.\n\nThe post Watch out Steam Deck, MSI’s ‘The Claw’ is coming for your title appeared first on Destructoid.",

Amongst them are Obsidian Entertainment's Avowed, MachineGames' Indiana Jones title, and Ninja Theory's Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2.\n\n\n\n\nThe Xbox Wire shed a few more details on what to expect from the event, including our first real look at Indiana Jones. The Developer Direct will spend about 10 minutes on the project, which includes the first gameplay trailer and details on the title's setting and story.\n\n\nThere weren't really any details given for Hellblade 2's segment. Instead, the Xbox Wire says to expect a behind-the-scenes look at the game courtesy of Ninja Theory. We last saw the title at The Game Awards within an impressive new trailer and a release window confirmed for this year.\n\n\nAvowed is getting a \"deep dive into the gameplay experience\" from Obsidian Entertainment. The studio will detail the game's Living Lands and the action RPG's \"deep themes, dynamic gameplay, and thoughtful reactivity.\"\n\n\nAlso at the Developer Direct will be Oxide Games' Ara: History Untold. We'll get a new look at gameplay and features from the history strategy game crafted by veteran developers of the Civilization series. \n\n\nXbox also notes that there will be a standalone presentation from Zenimax Online Studios following the Developer Direct. Here you can expect details on The Elder Scrolls Online's 2024 roadmap, including a new zone, storyline, and gameplay features. \n\n\nThe Xbox Developer Direct will stream on Xbox channels on Thursday, January 18 at 12:00 p.m. PST, 3:00 p.m. EST.\n\nThe post Xbox Developer Direct set for January 18, includes Indiana Jones and Avowed appeared first on Destructoid.",

According to Reuters, the company plans to ax 25% of its workforce, about 1,800 employees. \n\n\nThe layoffs are expected to be completed by March 2024 and it will affect all teams and areas of the business. The internal company memo states that this is being done as Unity \"restructures and refocuses on its core business, and to position itself for long-term and profitable growth.\" \n\n\nAt present, the company cannot determine what the related costs and charges will be though \"charges will primarily relate to employee transition, severance payments, and employee benefits.\" There has also been no word on what structural changes, though a company spokesperson confirmed that they are coming, Reuters reports. \n\n\nThese layoffs come after Unity faced great controversy in 2023 following the announcement of \"runtime fees\" for developers. Plans for these additional fees have continued, and CEO James Whitehurst states it is expected that the impact of this business model change will have \"minimal benefit in 2024 and ramp from there as customers adopt our new releases.\"\n\n\nLast year, the gaming industry witnessed waves of layoffs striking several companies. It appears the trend is far from over, with Unity's massive layoffs bringing a bad start to the year.

          "description": "Over the years, the Resident Evil series has become famous for more than its horror elements. From Chris Redfield punching a boulder to the cheesy voice acting in the original games, these moments are iconic in their own right. But the one that older fans will know and love is the infamous \"Jill sandwich\" line.\n\n\nNow, that has pretty much become a reality, thanks to user tombraidermods. Essentially, their mod allows you to play the original Resident Evil game as Jill, only now she's decked out to look like a giant sandwich, thus fulfilling Barry's prophecy.\n\n\nImage via tombraidermods/ModDB.\n\n\nIt doesn't get much Jill-Sandwich-ier than this. Nothing else seems to change about the game, other than putting the STARS agent in between two slices of bread.\n\n\nWhat? No lettuce?\n\n\nMaybe this needs a little bit of explanation for those who don't get the reference. See, in the first installment of Resident Evil, Jill Valentine is almost crushed by a slow-falling ceiling. However, she's saved at the last second by her colleague Barry Burton.\n\n\nUpon rescuing her from what would almost certainly be a horrifying death, Barry flippantly says that she almost became a \"Jill sandwich.\" Much mirth is had by both the zombie-shooting agents.\n\n\nOkay, maybe you had to be there. The point is, this mod turns that one, classic line into something literal. It's hard to say whether being wedged between two large slices of white makes taking on the hordes of undead cumbersome, but at least it gives the zombies something to much on that isn't Jill's brains.\n\nThe post Resident Evil’s ‘Jill Sandwich’ is real, thanks to this mod appeared first on Destructoid.",

In the West, few games have a reputation for being awful quite like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.\n\n\nThis is entirely because of the Angry Video Game Nerd, who I respect but isn’t always the best source since he’s primarily aimed at providing entertainment through a schtick. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde has been singled out by him as one of the darkest spots in the NES library. I have to disagree.\n\n\nOh, it’s definitely awful. Don’t assume that I’m here to defend it. It’s as boring as a lecture on the history of terrycloth (did you know it dates back to before 4000 BCE?) and as tedious as chewing through a concrete brick.

No announcement would be complete without its fair share of memes, so here's a few of the finest we've found.\n\n\nFor those out of the loop, Pictomancer is the second job announced for FFXIV's upcoming Dawntrail expansion. Seemingly based on Final Fantasy 6's Relm Arrowny, the new footage of the game showed how the Pictomancer will use the power of art to inflict damage. So, naturally, Pictomancer garnered a plethora of memes exploring the implications of life as a full-time artist.

This follows yesterday's news that Kaitlyn Dever (Booksmart, No One Will Save You) will play Abby in the show's second season. \nFor the uninitiated, Jesse is one of the characters that Ellie calls a friend in The Last of Us Part II and without spoiling anything, his character goes on quite the journey in the name of friendship. Manzino starred in Netflix's Beef series that aired last year, and he was featured in the music video for \"Snooze\" by SZA. Other credits include Prodigal Son, Drama High, Trinity's Triump, and Good Boy. \nWe're so excited for Young Mazino to step into the shoes of Jesse in @TheLastOfUsHBO Season 2. 🎉 https://t.co/GurthEHRZU\nJanuary 10, 2024\nFans of Naughty Dog's Last of Us series on PlayStation eagerly await the second season of HBO's The Last of Us. The first season debuted in January of last year, covering the events of the first game and its Left Behind DLC. HBO quickly confirmed the show would be getting a second season, which is set to premiere next year.\nWe loved the first season and can't wait to see how it adapts The Last of Us Part II, which is getting remastered later this month. It seems we aren't alone either – The Last of Us' premiere was HBO's second-largest debut since 2010, and viewers stuck around for the entire season. \nThe first season of The Last of Us has already won eight Emmy awards, and there are still other Emmys the series is up for when the last night of the awards show airs next week. For more, read Game Informer's review of The Last of Us and then read Game Informer's review of The Last of Us Part II. \nWhat do you think of this casting?

It's a complicated ouroboros, but the good news is it gives us a chance to revisit arguably the original survival horror game in a brand new light with the aid of Hollywood actors.\nJoin Wesley LeBlanc and me as we play though an early portion of the game and share their thoughts on how this could finally represent Alone in the Dark's chance to shine.

The presentation will provide updates on several of its most anticipated upcoming games.\nThe Developer Direct will air at 12 p.m. Pacific/3 p.m. Eastern. It will spotlight a few of Microsoft’s various first-party studios, which will provide an “in-depth look” at their games. Specifically, the Xbox Wire post lists Indiana Jones by Machine Games, Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II by Ninja Theory, Avowed by Obsidian, and Ara: History Untold by Oxide Games as the highlighted projects. \nIndiana Jones will receive its first gameplay trailer and feature 10 minutes of gameplay with developer commentary revealing the game's story and setting. Avowed and Ara: History Untold will receive a deep dive into their gameplay as well. For Hellblade II, Xbox is touting a behind-the-scenes look at Ninja Theory's Cambridge studio where the team will provide insight into how its bringing the sequel to life. It's unclear if this will include any new gameplay footage.\nMicrosoft also states that Direct will not include any updates on games from Activision Blizzard but to expect more news from those teams later this year. Microsoft officially completed its acquisition of Activision last year. \nThe Direct will run for one hour. Shortly after it concludes, ZeniMax Online will host The Elder Scrolls Online Global Reveal at 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET.\nXbox has several big projects we haven’t seen in a while, so it’ll be nice to learn more about even some of them. Indiana Jones was announced in 2021 with only a teaser video and we’ve yet to see gameplay. Avowed, Obsidian’s first-person fantasy RPG, was revealed in 2020 and is slated to launch this year. The game’s latest trailer premiered at last year’s Game Awards. \nAra: History Untold is a turn-based strategy RPG that debuted during a 2022 Xbox Showcase. Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II was the first Xbox Series X/S game announced back in 2019 and most recently popped up during the last Game Awards.",

The game first arrived on Xbox Series X/S and PC in August 2022.\nLike Barlow’s previous works, Her Story and Telling Lies, Immortality sees players interacting with live-action footage to solve the mystery behind the disappearance of fictional actress Marissa Marcel (Manon Gage). Once a promising young star, Marcel only made three movies – none of which were ever released – before she vanished. \nLearning what happened to Marcel involves searching out dozens of clips of each film’s behind-the-scenes footage, scrubbing them for clues, and finding related videos using the ability to “match cut.” This mechanic allows players to click on elements within a scene (like a person or object) to uncover new clips featuring that selected element. The PS5 version enhances these mechanics with new haptic feedback and controller speaker features.\n\n\nImmortality’s unsettling atmosphere, inventive mechanics, and strong storytelling earned it a place on Game Informer’s Top 10 Games of 2022. Immortality is also available now on Xbox Series X/S, PC, and mobile devices via Netflix.",

In addition to unveiling a lengthy cinematic trailer, fans got a look at one of the game’s two new jobs and its new playable race.\nMeet the Pictomancer, a new class described as a “magical ranged DPS job that works in the medium of mixed aether, wielding a specialized brush to render their imaginings reality.” Basically, the Pictomancer is a painter wielding a giant magical brush that conjures spells using paint. Check it out in action in the trailer below:\n\n\nA new cat-like race called the Hrothgar was also revealed in the form of a female variant. The trailer below provides a glimpse of the race out in the wild.\n\n\nLastly, the big video is a 5+ minute cinematic trailer showing off Dawntrail’s vibrant tropical setting, tone, and plenty of beautifully rendered action. \n\n\nLast year, Square Enix announced that Final Fantasy XIV is finally coming to Xbox Series X/S this spring. During the event, the studio revealed that an open beta test of the Xbox version begins sometime in February, giving players their first taste of the game before its arrival.\nFinal Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail is slated to launch later this summer.

The transition from pixel art to fully animated computer graphics was a massive enough leap ahead, but the beauty of this classic title was much more than skin deep. Final Fantasy VII features an incredible cast of characters, an outstanding battle system, and a story that evokes joy, awe, anger, and grief. Final Fantasy VII is well-established as one of the most iconic and beloved video games of all time, but for Square Enix, the legacy is somewhat more important. \nFor the team behind the Final Fantasy franchise, Final Fantasy VII was the entry that made the developers realize they needed to adapt to the times. \"Even within the mainline Final Fantasy titles as a series, we can co…",

If you've ever played a Persona game, you're likely familiar with the \"opening movie,\" which is the awesome animated opening to the game set to what is typically the main theme song. Ahead of Persona 3 Reload's release next month, Atlus has released its opening movie, debuting a brand new track called \"Full Moon Full Life.\" \nIn it, we get a look at the main character and the rest of the cast, as well as Persona, Igor, and more. As you might expect, the opening movie retains the flashy and stylish animation Persona has become known for over the years, and no surprise, it looks great. Atlus notes the trailer contains violent and sensitive content, however, so be wary of that before pressing play. \nCheck out the Persona 3 Reload opening movie for yourself below: \n\n\nFor more about the game, check out Game Informer's hands-on preview of Persona 3 Reload and then read Game Informer's list of all upcoming video game remakes.

The video hypes both first and third-party releases, many of which already had release dates/windows, but it also casually confirms 2024 launches for two previously un-dated projects.\nSpecifically, the video labels Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Silent Hill 2 as 2024 games. Both games, each a remake of their respective titles, had no launch window prior to today. But the video and the accompanying PlayStation Blog post confirm as much, which is a little surprising to see happen with relatively limited fanfare instead of Konami rolling out individual red carpets for each game's launch update. But if you're looking forward to playing either title, this is welcomed news nonetheless.\n\n\nSilent Hill 2 was announced in 2022 as a remake of the 2001 classic and is being developed by Bloober Team. The studio recently shared that work on the game was “progressing smoothly”, and it is a PlayStation 5 console exclusive (but will also launch on PC). \nMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a Unreal Engine 5 remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. It was announced during a PlayStation Showcase last May, and Konami released its first in-engine gameplay footage last October. Despite its inclusion in today’s PlayStation video, Snake Eater is also coming to Xbox Series X/S and PC.",

Bread will never be the same again. \nFeast your eyes on the officially licensed Series S toaster, which is on sale now at Walmart. The novelty appliance boasts a wide slot to toast thick slices of bread, bagels, waffles, English muffins, and probably most PlayStation discs for the truly devoted. In a neat twist, the oven roasts the Xbox logo on the food itself to add a flavorful touch of corporate branding to your carb intake. \n\nThe toaster also sports a digital LED countdown timer, a six-setting shade selector dial for browning customization, a removable crumb tray, automatic temperature control, and a cool-touch exterior, among other perks. Though a cool appliance, I can’t help but wonder how many people will request a Series S as a gift from friends/family and receive this elaborately disguised kitchen accessory instead. \nThose interested can purchase the Xbox Series S toaster for $39.99.",

U.S.-based 13-year-old Willis Gibson just beat an unbeatable Tetris game that players have been attempting to complete since its release on the NES in 1989. \nOn January 1, Gibson reached level 157 of Tetris, a feat previously thought impossible. New techniques, like the \"hypertapping\" one discovered in 2010 by Thor Aackerlund (thanks, BBC), and \"rolling,\" discovered in 2021 according to IGN, allowed players to reach never before seen levels. Before that, getting past the thirties was all but impossible and now, Gibson has made it to level 157. As you can see in the video below, upon reaching that level, Tetris serves Gibson a kill screen – meaning it has crashed – ending his impossible run. \n\n\nIt took Gibson, who goes by Blue Scuti on YouTube, 38 minutes to reach this new kill screen. BBC reports that Gibson has been playing Tetris for about two years, or since he was 11. Alongside his achievement of reaching level 157, Gibson also obtained the new highest score for Tetris. \nIGN writes that players can theoretically make it to level 255, and players are already trying; they just have to get lucky and avoid the crash points from level 157 onward. Upon beating level 255, players are brought back to the first level. \nFor more, be sure to watch Gibson beat the record here, and then read about these Game Informer editors who beat six gaming world records. \n[Source: BBC, IGN]\nAre there any video game records you think you could beat?

And just like when the film Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey took advantage of that whimsical character entering the public domain, someone has already started making a twisted, horrifying version of Mickey. In this case, it’s a video game.\nIt’s called Infestation: Origins, and it’s the debut title by Nightmare Forge Games.

Ubisoft also confirmed to Kotaku that, \"the timing was incorrect and has since been amended.\" So, Star Wars Outlaws' release window has moved from late 2024 back to some general time this year.\nOriginal story:\nStar Wars Outlaws, Ubisoft's upcoming open-world Star Wars game, has enjoyed a vague 2024 release window since it was revealed at an Xbox Showcase last year. However, a recent post on Disney's official park blog has given the game a more specific window. According to the blog, Star Wars Outlaws is releasing late 2024. The blog post, which is a collection of 24 exciting Disney-things happening in 2024 reads, \"And for Star Wars fans – Star Wars Outlaws, the open-world Star Wars game is set to release late this year.\"\nStar Wars Outlaws follows an original Star Wars character named Kay Vess and seeks to explore a character archetype of the Star Wars universe we haven't spent much time with in video games: the Han Solo-inspired scoundrel. In the game, Vess (who has no Jedi abilities as far as we know) must survive by her wits and her ability to talk (or blast) her way through difficult situations.\nFor more on Star Wars Outlaws, you can read our interview with the game's narrative director, Navid Khavari, where we covered topics like whether or not the game will have an overlap with Shadows of the Empire and if the team has been communicating with Respawn regarding its Jedi series of games. The game is planned for release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

The 2008 Prince of Persia reboot didn’t reignite the series as Ubisoft had hoped, and 2010’s Forgotten Sands felt closer to a movie tie-in than a new, proper entry.\nThat game’s subtitle would end up being a portend of the future as the series seemed inexplicably lost to time.

In no time, the once billion-dollar industry was reduced to rubble.\nIn the summer of that same year, in Japan, gaming giant Nintendo released its first-ever home console with swappable cartridges.

It's literally my job to play video games and I bet someone could fill a reasonable top ten this year of titles I didn't even get time to touch. But even as it's a universal, undeniable truth, the revelation that you missed out on something popular is always met with the same incredulous statement.\n“You've never played this?”\nI understand the impulse. For instance, Baldur's Gate 3 took up so many hours of my 2023 that it's hard to fathom what the year would be like without it.

It was a fantastic year for gamers at home with great tentpole releases from PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo, and some excellent indies, too. For years to come, we will all likely argue that 2023 was one of the best – if not the best – year for games. But it was also a terrible year for the people who make games, with more than 10,000 developers laid off, studios closed, and more. \nBetween big video game releases, a heartbreaking amount of layoffs, record-breaking acquisitions and box office reports, and more, 2023 contained plenty of news stories that had us talking for weeks, speculating on the future of the industry, and reshaping how we view game development.

While he thought it dragged on a bit in the second half, our reviewer said, \"Calling Requiem a standard sequel is a disservice; Asobo has created a Plague Tale epic.\" You can read that full review here and take a look at the other two offerings below.\nThe other two games are Evil West and Nobody Saves the World, each also released in 2022. Evil West is a third-person shooter set in a world that's a fusion between a classic Wild West and gothic horror and one that reminded one of our editors of his time as a kid playing Darkwatch. Meanwhile, Nobody Saves the World is about a shapeshifting Nobody (yeah, that's his name) on a quest to find the wizard who can stop a fungal infection from overtaking the world. Written by John Carson, the Game Informer review reads, \"Despite its minor shortcomings, Nobody Saves the World kept me enthralled from start to finish.\"D All three games will be available to download on January 2.\nAnd as always, as the new comes in, the old must go; subscribers will have until January 1 to download the current crop of PS Plus games, which includes Lego 2K Drive, Powerwash Simulator, and Sable.\nAre you excited to check out any of January's PS Plus Games?
