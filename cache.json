Though it's not going to hit the Q1 target that was previously set, Bandai Namco has now confirmed that it'll release on 27th May.\nThe new (and very loud) trailer highlights some key features, in particular showcasing the neat little arcade environment that you'll be able to customise and improve.

          "description": "Buyer's Egret?\nTaito is a company with a rich history in the world of video gaming, and it's fair to say that if the Japanese veteran hadn't existed, the gaming landscape would look rather different today. Space Invaders arguably transformed interactive entertainment from a casual pastime into a global pop culture phenomenon, conquering not just its native Japan but the rest of the world, too. While Tomohiro Nishikado's seminal shooter is perhaps Taito's most famous accomplishment, its list of other classic titles is truly enviable. Bubble Bobble, Elevator Action, Darius, RayStorm, Qix, Rainbow Islands, Puzzle Bobble, Rastan, Chase H.Q., The Ninja Warriors… this is just a handful of the titles Taito has contributed to the medium over the decades and is barely scratching the surface.\nWhile Taito has been a subsidiary of Square Enix since 2005 and it's reasonable to say that the glory days of the firm have long since passed, the Taito name retains a considerable degree of cachet, even with modern players. It's fitting, then, that the latest in the recent line of 'mini cabinets' – which includes the Neo Geo Mini and Sega Astro City Mini – should be focused on Taito's arcade output. Based on the company's iconic arcade system, the Egret II Mini is a tabletop console that features its own screen and controls but requires external power (via USB-C) to function. It offers HDMI-out functionality and boasts a robust micro-switched joystick and responsive buttons.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "A muted celebration of an important developer.\nA small \"Powered by Arcade Archives\" message sits in the corner of Taito Milestones' dual-purpose title/game select screen, a subdued seal of quality there to let players know the emulation within is of the same standard we've come to expect from Hamster's prolific series, with all the usual features (and even the exact same interface) present and correct. What this means in practice is the digital recreations of arcade classics found here sit somewhere in the middle ground between the extravagance (and expense) of M2's extraordinary work and the less desirable 'It mostly functions as it should' efforts of old; quietly reliable releases where the games themselves are always the main attraction.\nSo it's a good thing the ten titles selected for this collection cover an impressive range of genres, offering everything from scrolling beat 'em ups and single-screen platformers to good old fashioned sci-fi shooting and abstract territory snatch 'em ups. There's definitely something here for everyone (so long as they have a taste for the '80s) no matter what their mood, the arcade origins of these titles naturally making quick casual bursts of play effortlessly enjoyable. Anyone hoping to spend longer with an old favourite will be pleased to hear every game supports online leaderboards, so if you can crush everyone at Alpine Ski or have dedicated your life to mastering The Fairyland Story then you can finally show off your awesome skills to the entire world. Those with an eye for detail can spend their time marvelling at The Ninja Warriors specialist screen options, beautifully preserving the game's three monitor's worth of widescreen display with settings that go above and beyond scanlines and resizing, aiming instead to echo the more honest (if disjointed) extended monitor/mirror setup of the original arcade cabinet, complete with optional offset screens and mismatched tinting.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The main English-language social media channels didn't even promote the event, with live stream pages only going live in the final hours before its start time. As a result we were suggesting keeping expectations low beforehand in the live blog, but it's just as well many of us tuned in.\nWith a trailer that seemed designed to make everyone think it was teasing Detective Pikachu 2, what we got was Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, which will be the first games of generation 9 and are coming this year. Of course this time of year is normally when the big November (presumably) games are unveiled, but with the recent release of Pokémon Legends: Arceus some had assumed gen 9 would have to wait until 2023; that's not the case.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

There were reports that it was shown off at E3 1996, but these appear to be false – a fact which has led many to speculate that the game was little more than a series of mocked-up screenshots and that the plug was pulled by Nintendo long before any serious development work was undertaken.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

A Billy Idol concert. Yeah, you read that right. I immediately made a beeline for the concert venue and was treated to a rather unflattering rendering of Billy Idol and his guitar-playing chum performing a song. (Whiskey & Pills from his 2014 album, rather than anything you’re likely to have heard.) After the cutscene, you’re left in the empty amphitheatre, alone apart from a couple of guys talking about how great the concert was.\r\n\n\r\nThere is no context for this cameo. Billiam doesn’t feature as an NPC. In the 40-ish hours I spent playing the game, I had no reason to return to the amphitheatre. It makes no sense whatsoever and the only explanation I can come up with is that someone involved in the game really likes Billy Idol and just wanted him in their game. It’s the sort of random that I can respect, and I only wish the game had more.\r\n\n \nRead more",

This time it’s going for a more linear arena shooter style, similar to 2013's Shadow Warrior, and it’s got generally the right idea. You play as the former freelance mercenary Lo Wang, and mainly just try to get from A to B. This means jumping through hand-crafted levels, and generally shooting and slicing your way through the various demonic mobs and mini-bosses that spawn in front of you. Whenever you’re not clearing out enemies in an arena setting, you’ll be parkouring between them, or using your skills to navigate some setpieces. That's basically it, that's the game.\nRead more",

Personally I’ve most enjoyed the ones designed with thumbstick controls in mind (like Horizon Zero Dawn and Death’s Door) but since I was interviewing Gabe Newell and members of the Deck dev team in the run-up to the Steam Deck's launch today, I took the chance to ask them if they had any suggestions.

And it certainly isn’t twee: from its no-nonsense, all-black design to the performance-tweaking options in its OS, the Deck is a serious device, even and especially when it’s serious about giving you a good time. That’s in spite of some imperfections, to be sure – the software, screen and battery life may disappoint anyone expecting another top-end Valve hardware masterclass to follow their Index virtual reality headset.

Exhibited most dramatically by Microsoft stumping up $69 billion for Activision Blizzard, this trend towards conglomerification has raised worries about both creative expression and the potential locking-down of more games to certain platforms.\nValve president and co-founder Gabe Newell is no stranger to making some additions. Valve famously hired the student developers of Narbacular Drop to work on what eventually became Portal, and acquired Firewatch developers Campo Santo in 2018. In our recent interview, I asked him whether he thought consolidation could be a problem for the industry going forwards.\nRead more",

The one-person dev team behind the air-to-air combat simulator is apparently in love with the floaty-shooty jumping jet, so much so that it’s the only type of plane available to fly in the game's early access release. The retro-styled sim lets you pore over the low-poly plane as it rests in the hangar, to rest your chin in your hands as you lovingly scroll through its various specifications, inspecting its payload like you’re checking a dog over for ticks. \r\n\n \nRead more",

No, not the added story mode, it’s more fundamental than that; it’s the handling. It just didn’t feel quite right in the last game, whereas here it’s arguably the most playable handling system of any modern racer that doesn’t have ‘Kart’ in its title. Even though your car slides at every opportunity, it’s actually disguising the fact there’s a great deal of grip here, making for an enjoyable experience whatever your skill level.\nRead more",

As part of that, he had been reading a lot of game studies, but had mixed feelings about sitting back and talking about what could, should, or ought to be done in games. “I was like, ‘Well, we could just build [something],’” he says. “That felt much more in the spirit of games as a medium anyway.”\r\n\n \nRead more",

Yes, it's an action-RPG that retains Souls' difficulty, but it's one that expands their labyrinthine worlds with a single offering that's dizzying in its scope. Perhaps most importantly, it's a world that encourages you to explore and wants you to win, even if its way of showing it is with a massive rock troll that wants to cave your face in. What Elden Ring provides is an adventure unlike anything else or anyone else's.

I’ve never eaten at an Olive Garden because a.) we don’t have them in the UK, and b.) unlimited pasta sounds like a death sentence. But I understand it’s viewed as a faux-fancy chain for people who think Al Dente was the name of the man who invented spaghetti, and not somewhere you’d want to earnestly praise as a quote unquote ‘serious critic’.\r\n\n\r\nBig Tones was having none of it. He applauded Hagerty’s celebration of Olive Garden as a genuine expression of widespread American food culture, calling her detractors ‘snarkologists’, and then published a book of her reviews. A class act, no doubt. And it’s this championing of the everyman gourmand, this deep passion for non-exclusionary, unpretentious foodie culture, that powers Total War: Warhammer 3’s most joyfully silly campaign experience.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Right, fellow gud gitters? Am I right?? Praise that sun real nice.\nUnless you've not looked at a calendar for the past year, or have been stuck in some sort of hellish nether-realm betwixt life and death (the lockdown jokes write themselves, I know), you'll know that FromSoftware's next punishing RPG Elden Ring is out on Friday. It's only February and yet we already have one of the most anticipated games of the year knocking on the door! To celebrate the newest addition to the Soulsborne family, we're using this week to post lots of cool articles about FromSoftware's lovely, grim, difficult games. That's right: welcome to Souls Week on RPS.\nRead more",

I'm particularly enjoying just letting rip with its big chunky guns when I mess up trying to be all sneaky-like. In my painstaking attempt to do a completely clean, blood-free ghost run in Dishonored 2 all those years ago, I'd sort of forgotten just how powerfully satisfying Arkane Lyon's eye for action really is, and I've been having a lot of fun rediscovering this as I beast my way around Blackreef's four main locations. \nAs you'd expect from an Arkane game, each one of these maps is absolutely huge, full of nooks and crannies and secret passageways just itching to be exploited as you try and take down all of its slightly mad Eternalist cult leaders in a single cycle. But the thing I've been most intrigued by in Deathloop so far isn't its weird cubby holes or how maps change over time. It's all those huffing great arcade cabinets littered about the place.

The report, commissioned by Paradox and conducted by Gender Balance, an external firm recommended by Paradox's employee union, outlines several proposals for how Paradox can create a better working environment for staff. Paradox say they intend to implement all of them.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Aside from thinking it should've been released 15 years ago, I've come to realise how spiteful it is. This is a game that can't stand it when you're successful, and I respect that.\nRead more",

          "description": "I think I'm tired of winter.\nIt's not the cold. It's not even the lack of anything to do. It's that when your main threat is starvation and hypothermia, and your only real tool is stockpiling, it often feels like your fate is already sealed come October, and waiting around to see if you survived or not carries the same sense of slow inevitability that the average RTS or 4X game does past the opening act.\nMy first village in Timberborn gave me that feeling. Even though its dry season is the opposite of Winter, the ultimate effect was the same. I've played this before, I thought. This is the villagers vs winter game again.\nI was a fool. A big, wrong fool.\nRead more",

We at the Electronic Wireless Show podcast like to think of it as Palentine's anyway, because we're all pals and you, our listeners, are all our pals too (including Henry \"Vitamin H\" Cavill). So today we're talking about our favourite romances in video games, but also our absolute best mates, too.\nSadly Matthew, one of our real life bestest pals, couldn't be here this week. Curiously, it's a much more well-behaved podcast than normal, suggesting that actually the chaotic influence was Matthew all along... Still, Nate updates us on his war gaming models, which are slowly becoming a diorama and/or dolls' house. I also tell him about the final third of a film about an aquarium where all the fish become zombies, called Aquarium Of The Dead. It is not a good film.\nRead more",

And now, following yesterday's reveal of Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet, we'll be diving headfirst into Generation 9 later this year on the Switch. \nClick here to watch embedded media\nA new generation of Pokémon is exciting for a number of reasons. There's the new story to unravel, a brand-new region to explore, and of course, new Pokémon to catch. Perhaps more exciting than all of that, though, are the three starter Pokémon that we'll be beginning our new Scarlet and Violet adventures with. It's the first big decision we'll all be making in Generation 9, other than choosing which version to play in the first place, and it's one that will stick with us for the entire duration (unless you're a heathen who doesn't use their starter on their journey to the Elite Four). \nAs expected, there are three starters to choose from: The Grass-type cat Sprigatito, the Fire-type croc Fuecoco, and the Water-type duckling Quaxly. \nClick here to view embedded media\n \n\nFor me, I'm going with Quaxly. It's not my favorite design of the group, to be honest, but since Generation 1, I've always chosen the Water-type starter (except in Sword and Shield because goodness, I loathed the design of Inteleon). I like Quaxly's design enough that I'll be able to return to my old habits, and that's exciting. I have to say, though – Fuecoco's giving me big Totodile vibes and Totodile is an all-time great starter. Sprigatito is a cat, though, and who doesn't love a good cat Pokémon? \nWith all of that in mind, we want to know: which starter Pokémon are you choosing in Scarlet or Violet?

Announced during today’s Pokémon Day stream, which also saw the reveal of Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet alongside the Daybreak Update for Pokémon Legends: Arceus, Shaymin hits the game via something called Oak’s Letter. \nAfter receiving the Oak’s Letter Mystery Gift, you’ll be able to encounter Shaymin and catch the mythical Pokémon and add it to your team. As noted by the trailer, it takes approximately two hours of play time before the Mystery Gift feature is unlocked in new playthroughs of Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl. \nYou have plenty of time, though, to take part in this Mystery Gift event because while it’s live starting today, it will be remain live until March 27 so you have over a month to add Shaymin to your Pokédex. \nWhile waiting to receive Oak’s Letter, read about the Pokémon Legends: Arceus Daybreak update, which is out later today, and then watch the reveal trailer for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. \nAre you excited to add Shaymin to your party?

You’ll be tasked with beginning an investigation into a new phenomenon that is causing a mass outbreak of what appear to be Alpha Pokémon.\nClick here to watch embedded media\nAs you can see in the trailer above, the phenomenon is causing some of the most challenging types of Pokémon in the game to appear all over the place and it seems it will be up to you to figure out first what’s going on, and then discover a way to stop it. It’s not a bad time to be catching some powerful Pokémon if you’re up to the challenge, though. \nThe Daybreak update will also bring new Pokémon battles to the training grounds in-game. Seemingly addressing one of players’ biggest complaints, this new update will make it so that there are more Pokémon battles against other trainers to take part in. As for how many or how often, who knows but fortunately, we don’t have to wait long to find out because the Daybreak update hits Pokémon Legends: Arceus later today. \nTo coincide with Pokémon Day, players who use the password \"ARCEUSADVENTURE\" in-game will receive 30 Ultra Balls, 30 Gigaton Balls, and 30 Jet Balls. \nFor more, read Game Informer’s Pokémon Legends: Arceus review and then read about Generation 9, which was just revealed today as Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet. \nAre you excited about the Daybreak update?

Now, halfway through the series, we reach one of the more divisive entries: Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception.  \nDeveloped by Naughty Dog, Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception was a big release for Sony's PlayStation 3 console on November 1, 2011. After the success of Uncharted 2 and it's blockbuster setpieces, Naughty Dog upped the stakes and pushed to include even more spectacular action moments. Unfortunately, that put a toll on development. In this episode, we talk about Uncharted 3's renewed focus on melee combat, how Last of Us' development impacted the team, and why Uncharted 3 almost shipped with a game-breaking bug. \nJoin hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and co-founder and the CEO of Kinda Funny Greg Miller (@GameOverGreggy) as we unpack the history and impact of Nathan Drake's third outing.  \nIf you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

Publisher THQ Nordic has assisted on this front by revealing which of its many titles are playable on Steam Deck at launch.  \nIn a press release, THQ has listed the following titles as Steam Deck Verified. That means they’re fully functional on the handheld:\nDarksiders II Deathinitive Edition\nDarksiders Genesis\nDesperados III\nThis is the Police 2\nThe next batch of titles is Steam Deck Playable. This is a step below Verified status because while these games work on the device, they may require some manual tweaking to get them running at full capacity:\nBattle Chasers: Nightwar\nBiomutant\nDarksiders: Warmastered Edition\nDestroy All Humans! (2020)\nElex\nExpeditions: Rome\nMX vs ATV All Out\nSpongebob Squarepants: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated\nThis is the Police\nThere are currently over 300 titles confirmed to be playable on Steam Deck and that number will grow as Valve and developers work to get games running on the handheld. Other confirmed titles include Persona 4, Dota 2, Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, Inscryption, and Valheim. \nAre you getting your hands on a Steam Deck today? Let us know in the comments!",

For more dedicated PC players, it provides a chance to take what may already be an extensive Steam library on the go – albeit with only specific titles optimized right now. Either way, the Steam Deck is an impressive first step into a promising future of portable PC play – with some significant issues holding it back from greatness.\nClick here to watch embedded media\nThe Steam Deck is big.

The game is currently 75-8o% off, dropping it down to $4.99 on Steam and $3.99 on consoles. 100 percent of the profits made during this sale will form a fund that will be donated to the Ukrainian Red Cross. In This War of Mine, players oversee and care for a group of civilian survivors of a devastating conflict in a commentary of the horrors of war. You can read 11Bit’s full statement below. \n11 Bit isn’t the first European Studio to condemn the attacks.

          "description": "Sony has asked a court to dismiss a class-action lawsuit against it first filed in November of last year that alleges gender discrimination within the company. \nFormer Sony IT security analyst, Emma Majo, sought court approval to turn her case into a class-action lawsuit last year on behalf of other women who worked for the company in the past. She alleged that “Sony discriminates against female employees, including those who are female and those who identify as female, in compensation and promotion and subjects them to a work culture predominated by men,” as reported by Axios last year. \nNow, Sony is asking a court to dismiss Majo’s class-action case against it, citing a lack of facts to support the claims presented in the lawsuit, Axios reports. \n“Despite the sweeping breadth of her lawsuit, the allegations in which [Sony Interactive Entertainment] categorically denies, she fails to plead facts to support either her individual claims or the claims of the broad-based classes of women she seeks to represent,” Sony’s lawyer wrote, according to court documents. \nFurthermore, Sony writes in documents that Majo failed to “identify a single policy, practice, or procedure at SIE that allegedly formed the basis of any widespread intentional discrimination or had a discriminatory impact on women,” and that Majo’s “widespread claims of harassment are based solely on unactionable allegations of run-of-the-mill personnel activity.” \nSony also asks the court to recognize what it calls a conflict of interest, too. Majo’s lawsuit includes an attempt to include all women who worked for SIE. Sony says this would include all of Majo’s managers since 2017, which were all women. Sony’s lawyer says that if those managers are included in the suit against Sony, “irreconcilable conflicts of interest” rise. \nOnly time will tell if the court approves Sony’s request to dismiss the case.  \n[Source: Axios]",

LTD., a long-time development partner that has worked on titles within franchises like The Legend of Zelda and Super Mario.\nIf you’ve been paying attention to the video game industry as of late, you likely already know that 2022 has so far been defined by one word: acquisitions. \nIt started with Take-Two Interactive, the parent company behind the Grand Theft Auto series, announcing back in January that it was acquiring mobile giant Zynga for nearly $13 billion. Then, a week later, Microsoft announced that it was acquiring Activision Blizzard, the company behind Overwatch and Call of Duty, for a colossal $68.7 billion, and then two weeks later, Sony revealed it was buying Bungie, the developer behind Destiny 2, for $3.6 billion.\nNintendo revealed earlier this month that despite acquisitions happening throughout the industry, it wasn’t going to change its investment plans. It also revealed that it’s not against acquisitions they deem necessary and it seems acquiring SRD was the next necessary move for the Kyoto-based company. \nSRD was founded in 1979 and has worked closely with Nintendo for decades, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Not only has it worked with Nintendo on Mario and Zelda games, but the studio has helped develop Animal Crossing entries, Game Builder Garage, 1-2 Switch, and Ring Fit Adventure. This acquisition transaction is expected to be complete by April 1, 2022, and at the time of this writing, a price has not been named. \nNintendo said in a statement that acquiring SRD will “serve to strengthen the management base of SRD and secure the availability of software development resources for Nintendo,” according to Video Games Chronicle. \nToday’s news about this acquisition is the first following Nintendo’s purchase of Luigi’s Mansion 3 developer, Next Level Games, back in January of last year. \n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]",

          "description": "Developer:\n      Sony Interactive Entertainment\n      \nSince the previous PlayStation 4 and Xbox One generation of consoles, game captures such as screenshots and videos have become more and more popular. With the start of this current generation back in 2020, it was clear that PlayStation and Xbox were going to encourage us even more to share our best captures. \nDoing so on Xbox Series X/S, and even Xbox One, has been relatively easy when it comes to getting images and videos off of the hard drive and onto your phone, for example. You simply capture what you want and in a few minutes, it’ll be automatically uploaded to the official Xbox app. From there, you can save and download the image to your phone, which makes sharing it on social media a breeze. However, that wasn’t possible on PlayStation, despite how much players wanted this feature…until now. \nClick here to watch embedded media\nAs you can see in the video above, PlayStation has rolled this feature out for PS5 players. You’ll need to enable it in your console’s settings and the PlayStation App first, of course, but after that, screenshots and videos under three minutes long will be automatically uploaded to the PlayStation App. They’ll remain there for 14 days and during that time you can save and download any images or videos you want to your mobile device. And, much like with Xbox game captures, this makes it much easier to share your captures with friends and others on social media. \nFor more about the PS5, read Game Informer’s list of the top 10 PlayStation 5 games and then check out these details about the latest PS5 beta, which adds extra party chat options, game base enhancements, UI changes, and more to the console.
