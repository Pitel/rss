The detective genre has evolved a great deal since its point-and-click adventure game roots, and this list proves how much things have changed. In fact, the games that we're including in this list range from typical noir detective fare to the kinds of games that you'll probably tell us \"don't count as detective games\" in the comments!\nHere's our reasoning, though: A detective game is about more than just a hard-boiled police guy in a trench coat and hat, who loves to grumble about grisly murders in the rain. Detectiving can be done by anyone with a need to uncover, discover, and answer questions, and many of the games we've chosen are about just that: Normal people, pulling threads until the whole thing unravels.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "An az-technical disappointment.\nConsidering its instantly recognisable iconography, the Mesoamerican Aztec culture is one that has rarely featured in video games. We’ve seen games like Aztec: Empire, sure, but there are a lot more examples tied to periods like the Second World War, the American Revolution, and Ancient Rome, to name but a few. Developer Liezo clearly thought the Aztec culture could do with a bit more love, chucking the period’s architecture and general aesthetic right into the future with Aztech Forgotten Gods. It’s a game that, unfortunately, stumbles out the gate with poor, shallow gameplay, messy visuals, and one of the most frustratingly chaotic camera systems we’ve seen in a while.\nThe story of Aztech Forgotten Gods takes place in a futuristic city filled with typical Aztec architecture (albeit more shiny), where protagonist Achtli is called upon to take on a group of stone colossi known as the ‘Forgotten Gods’ that have been inadvertently awakened, intent on wreaking havoc. Thankfully, Achtli comes into possession of a powerful stone artifact that fuses itself onto her arm, creating a magical gauntlet that would make the likes of Ron Perlman green with envy. The structure of the game is a loose take on Shadow of the Colossus, with Achtli’s primary goal to travel to specific areas of the map and vanquish the Forgotten Gods one by one.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Have A Nice Death is a roguelike where you take control of an overworked Death, whose employees have ditched their jobs and run amok. You’ll journey into the bowels of your company, find the miscreants, and scythe them back into work.\nDespite the game’s grim backdrop, it’s a joyful experience stacked with cracking combat and funny characters. The moreish roguelike hook is there, albeit with some early access hiccups to overcome. Give it some time and it could really shine, but whether it’ll get lost in the Steam release cycle before it even has a chance to fill out remains to be seen.\nRead more",

In Valhalla this manifests as protagonist Eivor, Viking raider and big blonde buff meat sculpture, being the reincarnation of Odin, one of the aforementioned god-people. Dawn Of Ragnarök is Eivor dreaming that they are Odin for about 35 hours of adventuring and son-saving in the magical realm of Svartalfheim. That's a pretty intense nap.\nRead more",

The Fertile Crescent trades the ol’ berry bush for pomegranate trees, a native of Western Asia.\r\n\n\r\nDevelopers Anders Groenningsaeter and André Read from Wield Interactive looked to the past as they refined The Fertile Crescent’s economy. “Since childhood, André and I have been equally fascinated by RTS games and the Bronze Ages,” Groenningsaeter explained to me. “How we’ve been inspired by history has shaped the game. During the Bronze Ages, the usage of coins hadn’t taken root yet. It was still to a large extent a barter economy, and food played an important role.”\r\n\n \nRead more",

The tycoon bit comes a bit later, letting players build up their own business until they've got enough cars and staff to do the driving for them. It's coming to early access on Steam toward the end of 2022, so let's hail down an announcement trailer, shall we?   \nRead more",

They weren't being synced properly online with the Steam Cloud, which led to Steam asking whether they wanted to use the cloud save or local save. This question spooked some, leading them to choose poorly and end up with an old save, missing maybe hours of progress. Oh no. That ssshould be fixed now, by a Steam patch Valve released on Friday. But do be cautious if you're asked.\nRead more",

I've said before I've never been much of a Soulsite, and it's not for lack of trying. I tried my darnedest to get into Dark Souls III when it first came out, but holy deathrattles, it was such a long, gruelling slog. Vordt of the Boreal Valley, the second (yes, second) boss of Dark Souls III, remains my lifelong nemesis. I just couldn't get past it. I'm someone who always likes to be making forward, tangible progress when I play games, and banging my head against the same boss for hours on end is my idea of actual hell.\nI'm no better at playing Elden Ring, to be honest. I spent a good couple of hours last night just trying to get past one of those big tentacle-beard monkey lads with the hollowed out stomachs on the way up to Stormveil Castle. Not even a named, actual sub-boss! And yet, I'm actually enjoying this version of Souls-style head-bashing a lot more than I've ever done before. And I think it's to do with Elden Ring's plentiful supply of save points.\nRead more",

In normal times, it wouldn’t make much sense to buy this £239 / $249 GPU – not because it’s the lowest in the RTX range, but because the much more powerful RTX 3060 would only cost a few notes more.\r\n\n\r\nAnd yet, these are not normal times. While the MSI GeForce RTX 3050 Gaming X 8G model I’ve tested has already ballooned to £380 / $450, this leaves it looking like much more of a  genuine alternative to RTX 3060, which is generally around £500 in the UK.

          "description": "Babylon's Fall is an online action-RPG developed by PlatinumGames, the devs behind excellent hack n' slashers like NieR Automata and Bayonetta. This is a studio that knows how to craft one-off stories filled with flashy combat, humour, and emotional gut-punches.\nBut the game is also Platinum's first foray into the dreaded minefield of live service and it's... not good. Aside from the teensiest glimpses of what could've been, the game is a bemusing cascade of loot and stats that don't mean all that much. The combat has its moments but is largely bleh. The story is meh. And it's all yours for £60 - heh?!\nRead more",

The train really gets derailed early as we start talking about Elden Ring, and thus, naturally, what bit of Matthew a king would steal for said king's own body? (The answer is Matthew's nice soft hair). We hear more about Nate's orc/goblin dolls house too, of course, and at certain points in the podcast do manage to drag things back round to talking about the actual topic of the podcast.

          "description": "The Ziggurat is an imposing presence in the lakeside hub town of Babylon’s Fall, its broad, horizon-spanning arches giving away nothing about the kind of fantastical beasts and secrets you’ll find inside. Based on the Tower Of Babel, the mythological birthplace of all the world’s languages, it’s perhaps ironic that Square Enix and PlatinumGames’ latest hack and slash started life with its own kind of miscommunication. When it was first unveiled at E3 2018, it looked like PlatinumGames were doubling down on all the good stuff they’d delivered just a year earlier with Nier: Automata, giving us another high-octane, single player action game with a dizzying array of weapons and over the top soundtrack, all wrapped up in an enticing layer of gothic high fantasy as players fight their way skyward. \nA long silence then followed, release dates slipped again and again, and its single follow-up trailer during one of Sony's 2019 State Of Play broadcasts remained as inscrutable as its iconic Ziggurat. It wasn’t until E3 2021 that the game’s true nature was finally revealed. Rather than being a solo adventure, Platinum and Square declared that not only would Babylon’s Fall be a primarily online multiplayer game, but that it was also going to be a live service game in the vein of Destiny and The Division. It was surprising, to say the least, but when I put the question to the PlatinumGames and Square Enix’s joint development team, Square Enix producer Junichi Ehara tells me that this was far from a sudden change of heart on their part: “From the very start of the project, it was decided that Babylon’s Fall would include the elements of high fantasy, hack-and-slash, and live service.” \nRead more",

The dong of their menu sounds (I love a good menu noise) and their elevators operated by pressure plates.\nThere's also one other big thing that Soulsborne games deliver on. As any seasoned player knows, it's not a FromSoft game without the laughs. While there's plenty of humour in the cliff falls and silly invasions, I'm talking in a more literal sense. The NPCs often round off their sentences with a chuckle. But so far, Elden Ring lacks the despairing \"hahaha\" of old. And it makes me sad.\nRead more",

That’s according to Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais, who spoke to us at length on the making of the Deck and its future prospects.\r\n\n\r\nValve have previously made the peculiar move of showing exactly how to open a Steam Deck and remove individual parts, complete with video, while simultaneously declaring it something owners should refrain from.

You are Vix (vikfikfok), an fox wot fixes things in a distant future, where humans started to gene-splice themselves with animals for the convenience of having, for example, lovely warm fur. This is a step I would 100% take; even as I write this in the office I am wrapped in a blanket I brought in from home, and my fingers are still cold. I would be less able to repair things using bits of tape and coins I found in holes in the ground, but then I am not a mechanic.\nVix is a mechanic, although they are laughed at by their compatriots for being quite a bad one. They have a sentient tool box called Tin, but misadventure means all Vix's conventional tools are lost. In the course of a pretty meaty preview build I got to explore a strange, cuboid planet, top-down stylee, and repair things for a buncha robots. But there are loads of other aspects to FixFox - a preoccupation with food, a kind of space-sokoban game, a story that hints at mystery and evolution and time. Part puzzle game, part sci-fi adventure, part fok.\nRead more",

If I'd had my act together, I could have used this letter to give you a glimpse of all the exciting things we've just done - things like our freshly-concluded Souls Week, or all the neat Steam Next Fest bits we had planned, and (maybe) even a sneaky peek at all the excellent Steam Deck stuff we've written about as well. Alas, my time management skills have been a bit of a dumpster fire this month - although if you haven't checked out everything I've just mentioned, please do go and have a read. The RPS team have been very busy bees this month, and it would be a shame to miss out on all the great stuff going on.  \nOf course, the question now becomes, how do we carry on this kind of momentum when literally nothing has a confirmed release date past the end of March?

Elden Ring is, of course, much better than sick at any temperature, obviously - I'm just saying that so far, I have not found it to be much easier or less opaque than any other FromSoft game, except it has clearer tooltips and sometimes an NPC will say, \"You should do this thing.\" In fact, the open world - the thing that people say is the most good bit - is having the opposite effect on me.\nRead more",

          "description": "Just a few minutes out of Elex 2’s, pleasantly brief, tutorial area I came across a radio. The broadcast was announcing a concert at the nearby amphitheatre. A Billy Idol concert. Yeah, you read that right. I immediately made a beeline for the concert venue and was treated to a rather unflattering rendering of Billy Idol and his guitar-playing chum performing a song. (Whiskey & Pills from his 2014 album, rather than anything you’re likely to have heard.) After the cutscene, you’re left in the empty amphitheatre, alone apart from a couple of guys talking about how great the concert was.\r\n\n\r\nThere is no context for this cameo. Billiam doesn’t feature as an NPC. In the 40-ish hours I spent playing the game, I had no reason to return to the amphitheatre. It makes no sense whatsoever and the only explanation I can come up with is that someone involved in the game really likes Billy Idol and just wanted him in their game. It’s the sort of random that I can respect, and I only wish the game had more.\r\n\n \nRead more",

A man who invents successive tales of fantasy in an effort to stay his likely execution by an impatient general interrogating him in a dark room. Ivan is the little guy in every sense, small in stature, a hunching underdog to forces beyond his control. As the likeable hero of Little Orpheus, a vibrant modernising of the cinematic platformer, he builds a rapport with the general that carries the game as best it can through eight beautiful but ultimately formulaic levels. This is a light game, unchallenging by design, and for me, sleepily so. \nRead more",

          "description": "Shadow Warrior 3 continues the series tradition of completely rebooting the style of each game. This time it’s going for a more linear arena shooter style, similar to 2013's Shadow Warrior, and it’s got generally the right idea. You play as the former freelance mercenary Lo Wang, and mainly just try to get from A to B. This means jumping through hand-crafted levels, and generally shooting and slicing your way through the various demonic mobs and mini-bosses that spawn in front of you. Whenever you’re not clearing out enemies in an arena setting, you’ll be parkouring between them, or using your skills to navigate some setpieces. That's basically it, that's the game.\nRead more",

If it's anything like ginger puss cat Tiger in Jeremy \"Aviary Attorney\" Noghani's turn-based RPG Small Saga, they're going to be in trouble, as these rodents come bearing switchblades and cigarette lighters to fend off their deadly foes. It's an intriguing take on the classic Final Fantasy-like job types of other RPGs - the switchblade is to protagonist Verm what Cloud's Buster Sword is to a regular human, while Siobhan's lighter allows her to cast fire 'magic' as the party's mage - and based on its hour-long Steam Next Fest demo, it's shaping up to be just as grand a tale as its lauded genre mates. \nRead more",

          "description": "Over the course of my Steam Deck review testing, the majority of games I tried ran without issue. Some didn’t get on with SteamOS’s Proton compatibility software, and others needed a bit more work on the ol’ anti-cheat, but I wouldn’t be surprised if most Steam games end up rated as Verified or Playable in Valve’s compatibility review programme.\nWhat, then, are some of the very best games to play on the Steam Deck? Personally I’ve most enjoyed the ones designed with thumbstick controls in mind (like Horizon Zero Dawn and Death’s Door) but since I was interviewing Gabe Newell and members of the Deck dev team in the run-up to the Steam Deck's launch today, I took the chance to ask them if they had any suggestions. Here's what they've been playing.\nRead more",

          "description": "From Ubisoft to Konami to the Epic Games Store, games companies are doubling down on NFTs as fast as others are backtracking on them. Valve, on the other hand, aren’t likely to get involved any time soon, owing to “a lot of criminal activity and a lot of sketchy behaviours”. That’s according to co-founder Gabe Newell, who recently spoke to us about his concerns around crypto.\r\n\n\r\nWhile indie game store Itch.io declared NFTs a scam, Newell is more open to the “underlying technology of distributed ledgers” – but says there are just too many bad actors using that technology for nefarious endeavours, namely fraud and money laundering. Steam banned games with NFTs and cryptocurrency last year.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The consolidation of the games industry – that is, games companies being bought up and absorbed by bigger games companies – has been increasing, intensifying, and giving poor Ed the aches. Exhibited most dramatically by Microsoft stumping up $69 billion for Activision Blizzard, this trend towards conglomerification has raised worries about both creative expression and the potential locking-down of more games to certain platforms.\nValve president and co-founder Gabe Newell is no stranger to making some additions. Valve famously hired the student developers of Narbacular Drop to work on what eventually became Portal, and acquired Firewatch developers Campo Santo in 2018. In our recent interview, I asked him whether he thought consolidation could be a problem for the industry going forwards.\nRead more",

          "description": "Eight more women, some current and some former employees, have added their accounts of sexism experienced at Sony PlayStation to a proposed class-action lawsuit. \nThis news comes by way of Axios, which reports that these eight claims will be added to the claims of former Sony IT security analyst Emma Majo. She filed a lawsuit against the company last year, alleging that “Sony discriminated against female employees, including those who are female and those who identify as female, in compensation and promotion and subjects them to a work culture predominated by men.” \nMajo sought court approval in 2021 to turn her case into a class-action lawsuit, stating that she filed the suit on behalf of herself and all women who have worked for Sony before and those still working there. Then, in Februar…",

          "description": "Square Enix has created a new YouTube channel specifically for soundtracks and other music from various games and projects the company is known for. \nBrought to our attention by the reporting of Video Games Chronicle, the Japanese game publisher created a YouTube channel called Square Enix Music. The company is hosting several playlists featuring the soundtracks of many of its RPG series and games. Want to listen to the Final Fantasy VIII soundtrack? It's there! In the mood for tunes from SaGa Frontier II? There's a playlist waiting! Even Balan Wonderworld's music can be found on the channel. Kick back and relax to your favorite Square soundtracks, just like I am while writing this article and head-bobbing to the Final Fantasy XIV: Shadowbringers OST.\nThe opening of the Square Enix Music channel comes with the addition of over 5,500 Square Enix tracks that can now be listened to by YouTube Music users. These songs have long been available on other services such as Apple Music and Spotify. Still, it's great to see this incredible collection readily available to enjoy in even more places. If you're new to YouTube Music and looking to listen there, you can do it for free, though there will be some ads every once in a while. Upgrading to a premium subscription will allow users to download songs for offline listening and eliminate the commercials from the experience.\nWhich Square Enix soundtracks are your favorites? I'm pretty partial to FFVIII and even incorporated some of its songs into my wedding. Let me know your favorites in the comments below!",

While most of us are still struggling against early-game legacy dungeons and the bosses that skulk around within them, some skilled (and lucky) few are rushing through the game with relative ease. One such speedrunner beat Elden Ring in under three hours, and they did it convincingly: they didn’t suffer a single death. \nClick here to watch embedded media\nSo who is this legendary Tarnished? niko bellic (an obvious homage to the Liberty City everyman) spent their two and a half-hour playthrough dashing past non-essential bosses while on horseback. Eurogamer likens the Elden Ring speedrunning experience to Breath of the Wild – players found increasingly unique ways to challenge Ganon, despite being severely under-leveled. It’s safe to say that niko bellic had to surmount similar restrictions as the only runes they likely collected were from a smattering of grunts and, primarily, mainline bosses. You can watch the speedrun above, but it comes with a healthy dose of story/gameplay spoilers. \nOur very own Dan Tack awarded Elden Ring a perfect 10 out of 10 and fell in love with the lore, various tense encounters, and overall sense of player agency and discovery. He concluded his review by stating:\n“Elden Ring challenged me, captivated me, and enchanted me, an unyielding deluge of discovery and artistic vision unbound. Elden Ring represents a truly amazing combination of various game elements that all come together to create something fascinating, special, and unforgettable. Elden Ring isn’t just the best game this year; it’s one of the best games ever made.”\n\nAs a newcomer to From Software games, I can’t help but agree.\n[Source: Eurogamer]",

While it’s called a “Monster Hunter Digital Event,” which might imply we could see more than just one game in the Monster Hunter franchise, the tweet announcing the stream heavily suggests it’s all about Sunbreak. \nTune in to the Monster Hunter Digital Event - March 2022 for approximately 20 minutes of programming, including exciting reveals of new monsters, gameplay info, and more! #Sunbreak\nhttps://t.co/8IzgK7w1Wf pic.twitter.com/imVwF1Qdae\nMarch 8, 2022\nAs you can see in the tweet above, there’s special emphasis on Monster Hunter Rise’s Sunbreak expansion, due out this Summer, so it’s probably not wise to expect anything else to be announced. However, with 20 minutes devoted to Sunbreak, it sounds like Capcom has a lot to share, like monsters, new gameplay mechanics, and much more. \nClick here to watch embedded media\nFortunately, we don’t have to wait long because the stream goes live next Tuesday. In the meantime, read Game Informer’s Monster Hunter Rise review and then find out why it’s on Game Informer’s list of the top 10 action games to play right now. Check out this story about how Sonic and Tails are (kinda) in Monster Hunter Rise now after that. \nAre you excited about Sunbreak? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "PlayStation has announced a State of Play presentation for tomorrow, March 9, at 2 p.m. PT/4 p.m. CT/ 5 p.m. ET with a special focus on games from its Japanese publishers. \nThis news comes by way of a new blog post released today that says this State of Play will run for roughly 20 minutes. It will highlight games from Japanese publishers, but PlayStation says it will have a few updates from other developers too. Here's the announcement from the PlayStation Blog:\nAs always, PlayStation will air the State of Play stream on both its YouTube and Twitch channels. As for what to expect, considering Sony is highlighting games from its Japanese publishers, the safest bet seems like PlayStation console-exclusive Final Fantasy XVI, which was first revealed during a Sony showcase like this, or even Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin, which will be released on March 15. \nAs for the \"few updates from other developers located around the world,\" God of War: Ragnarok seems like a lock considering it's supposed to release this year and we still haven't seen much of it, save for a few trailers. Of course, this is all just speculation. Fortunately, we don't have to wait long because this 20-minute State of Play is just a little over 24 hours away. \nWhat do you hope to see tomorrow?

Reportedly, the showrunners of Amazon’s hit sci-fi show The Expanse, as well as The Wheel of Time, will helm the series alongside PlayStation Productions. Representatives from both Sony and Amazon Studios declined to comment on Deadline’s story.\nThere’s no word on what the show itself would entail or whether it’s based on the original Greek mythology series or the current Norse-themed games. Either would make sense given that PlayStation Productions exists to expand Sony’s first-party franchises into broader media, such as the recent Uncharted film and upcoming Ghost of Tsushima movie. \nIf true, it wouldn’t be the first video game live-action show on Amazon’s plate. It’s currently developing a Fallout show, recently casting Walton Goggins in an unknown role. Other video game adaptions hitting TV include HBO’s The Last of Us, which premieres next year, and Paramount+ subscribers can look forward to the upcoming Halo series. Paramount also recently announced a Sonic the Hedgehog movie spin-off starring Knuckles. \n[Source: Deadline via IGN]",
