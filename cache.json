Publisher Devolver Digital has bleated about the game's success today, revealing that Massive Monster's not-so-cuddly (or maybe very cuddly, depending on what your tolerance for sheep bloodshed is) has reached a milestone of one million sales.\nThat means one million of us have signed up to this woollen cult, and while this is a fantastic number in the game's first week, Massive Monster isn't settling there. The developer has been listening to our baa-ing and it and Devolver have acknowledged our \"struggles\" — which means it's aware of the bugs, glitches, and \"all manner of fiendish things that must be eliminated\".\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

A couple of big names come to mind, the obvious one being Final Fantasy Tactics, Tactics Ogre if you count their PSP remake of Quest's SNES original, and most recently, Triangle Strategy on the Switch. Outside of that, though, it's all a bit barren, which is why the real-time tactical sword-swinging of their upcoming strategy RPG The DioField Chronicle is such an interesting landgrab for them. To say they're pushing into new territory would be an understatement. \nHappily, judging by the sizable first chapter of the game (currently available to play for free on Steam until the game's release on September 22nd), it's clear that Square Enix and their development partners at Lancarse have a lot of smart decisions here. With its focus on individual hero characters instead of nameless military units, mixed in with the magical pizazz and flashy summons of its Final Fantasy games, The DioField Chronicle could just be the Fire Emblem-shaped hole PC players have been looking for. \nRead more",

          "description": "Luca Le Fae has had it. His work as a writer for Leviathan Games, one of the biggest game developers on the planet, may pay well, but it’s creatively unfulfilling. A fateful encounter with his old acquaintance, Jey Zhang, at a party may just provide Luca with the escape he has been looking for. Jey, a successful music producer, remembers Luca as an incredible songwriter and asks him if he has any samples he could send her. Suddenly the unthinkable, a single, an EP, perhaps even actual stardom, seems within Luca’s grasp, but life has a tendency to get in the way even when you’re ready to take the chance of a lifetime.\nWe Are OFK can be described as a 3D visual novel or a mildly interactive five-part TV series you just happened to buy on Steam. The first two episodes are available on launch day, with episodes three to five releasing weekly after the game's initial release. Each one comes with its own opening, which really sells the feeling of catching a new episode of a miniseries each week. With each episode, you follow the story from a different band member's point of view, from their initial decision to be band-adjacent to taking their first wobbly steps in promoting themselves as artists. Joining Luca on his journey are pianist Itsumi Saito, who works in social media management at Leviathan, and Luca’s housemate Flores, an audio-visual effects artist.\nRead more",

          "description": "Time has never been very kind to QUBE. The first-person puzzler first began life as a university project in the late 00s, but by the time it finally launched commercially in early 2012, it was almost universally written off as nothing but an okay Portal clone. In fairness, there was a lot working against it. Like Portal, it was set in a largely white, sterile testing facility, and while it didn't involve flinging boxes through portals, each one of its puzzles did revolve around manipulating brightly coloured blocks to progress to the next room. The one major thing it was lacking, and probably a large part of why it never really stacked up to Portal at the time, was a GLaDOS-sized villain. QUBE's story would come later, in the 2014 Director's Cut, which added an entire script, voice-acting and a revamped musical score to give Toxic Games' puzzler a bit more, well, shape.\nEven with all those extra flourishes, though, the Director's Cut was still the same QUBE puzzles from before, leading many to write off the update yet again as a slight improvement on the original, but nothing to get too excited about. Now, in 2022, QUBE is getting a fancy 10th Anniversary Edition that rebuilds both versions of the game from the ground up, while also adding an entirely new sector that doubles the length of the game. And I'm telling you: please don't write off QUBE for the third time in its life. It deserves better than that.\nRead more",

But it’s ok, isn’t it? After all, the person in front of you has committed a crime and must be rehabilitated; reckless driving, hit and run, and arson.\r\n\n\r\nSo, you get to work. Talking to Unid allows you to build a rapport and understand their motivations. You learn about their past. They talk of their difficult childhood, pets, a lack of support - broken systems that left them behind and put them on their current path. It doesn’t matter. You have a job to do. And now, with that bit of knowledge, you’ve found the 'bug' in their programming. After initiating a hack on their brain, you eradicate this flaw, forcefully transforming their mind into a paradise of purity. Unid will never commit another crime again. Have you done the right thing?\r\n\n \nRead more",

A metaphorical spanner gets lobbed into the works, however, as the ceremony is interrupted with news that London’s citizens have started attacking each other (more than your average fisticuffs to get on the tube). Oddly, this doesn’t seem to have affected Amelia and your motley circus troupe, who venture out into London’s dangerous streets to find answers.\nRead more",

I do, however, have a confession to make. When I started seeing other real life cats enjoying the game alongside their respective humans, I began to feel sad and a bit left out. You see, my cats Maple and Midna (still!) haven't shown any interest in Stray whatsoever, not even flicking up their ears in response to the cat's in-game meow. I'm not gonna lie, it kinda broke my heart a little bit.\nHowever, I'm beginning to think their (clear and apparent) hatred of video games goes further than simple disinterest. I was playing A Plague Tale for the first time last week, a game famous for its swarms of screeching rats, and STILL nothing. They love hunting rats and bringing them home to leave as little presents for us on our back door step. Heck, they'll even wig out and go into prowl mode when they hear them scrabbling away underneath our floorboards (yes, we do have a rat problem in our house). But clearly, their ice cold little murder hearts are unmoved by their video game equivalents. Is this what it's like when your children reject your hobbies and go and sulk in their rooms for the rest of the day? Because it sure does feel like it.\nRead more",

          "description": "Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered is the latest ex-PlayStation exclusive to rock up on PC, following a collaborative effort between original developers Insomniac Games and porting specialists Nixxes. It’s also a skyscape-swinging, baddie-decking good time, so says Alice Bee’s review, and one that comes with plenty of special features just for the Windows version. I’ll be posting a more performance-and-hardware-focused guide to it later this week, but in the meantime I called up Jurjen Katsman, founder and senior director of development at Nixxes, and Mike Fitzgerald, core technology director at Insomniac, for a chat about how Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered makes the jump to PC.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I've played a lot of Spider-Man games. To this day I nurture the belief that all tutorials should be narrated by Bruce Campbell. I even played Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions, which had four different web-dudes and later inspired the Spider-Verse storyline in the comics. Point is, I'm standing on pretty solid ground to judge Spider-Man games. Marvel's Spider-Man, originally released onto Sonyboxes in 2018, is finally coming to PC in a Remastered form, and let me tell you: it is a great Spidey game.\r\n\nYou know Spider-Man. He's a dude named Peter Parker who was bitten by a radioactive spider and can now climb up walls and punch criminals really well. Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered lets you roleplay being Spidey against the backdrop of a big, living New York city. It is, if you'll excuse the pun, amazing. Now, is it the best Spidey game? Nah. I reckon that's its spin-off/sequel Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, but that's not on PC yet. This means Marvel's Spider-Man gets to be the best wall-crawler game on PC for another few months, which isn't a bad consolation prize. \nRead more",

          "description": "When Sony revealed that Spider-Man Remastered was headed to PC earlier this year, I became fixated with the idea that the game would potentially work on the Steam Deck. I mean, it worked on a base PS4, right? By my understanding the Steam Deck is basically just a PS4 with a screen slapped on it, so surely portable Spider-Manning wasn't an unrealistic thing to expect?\nAfter spending a few days testing out the game on the Deck I'm thrilled to confirm that Spider-Man Remastered plays great on Valve's handheld with only a few very minor caveats. Hooray! I can finally punch a Vulture in my back garden without getting shouted at by local bird protection services. What a time to be alive.\nRead more",

Katharine wakes up and immediately sets to work cleaning up the mountains of poop and vomit puddles left over from the previous night's revelries. As she works, she spies her good friend Alice B harvesting cauliflowers from the cult's garden, trying to keep as far as possible away from the (now slightly rotting) corpse of Graham that lays nearby. A cluster of other followers are busy dancing around a shrine in the centre of the village, but they all stop to witness a fight between the two oldest members of the cult - Alice0 and Liam. Ritual combat of the elderly is a staple of CultPaperShotgun, and as Alice0 delivers the final blow to an ailing Liam, cries of euphoria reverberate about the camp as his spirit (and chunks of flesh) are donated to the cause.\nWhere am I in all this, you ask? I, the Lamb, the glorious leader of our cult, the holy vessel of Death itself, and the sworn enemy of the Bishops of the Old Faith that are destined soon to die by my blade? I'm kicking back at a nearby camp, enjoying a spot of fishing and a friendly game of Knucklebones.\nThis, friends, is Cult Of The Lamb. And it is excellent.\nRead more",

And while new games are being celebrated, the hits are getting their fair share too. Several classics hit Xbox Game Pass for PC today.\nThese games range from the fourth entry in the Quake series to much, much further back, like The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard, Battlespire, and a few Wolfenstein games.\nIf you want something a little bit more modern, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate perks now unlock all champions for use in Quake Champions.\nhttps://twitter.com/bethesda/status/1560312695546847232\nQuake Champions is actually free right now on the Microsoft Store, alongside a few other games. The Elder Scrolls: Arena and The Elder Scrolls: Daggerfall are up for download on the Microsoft Store for the low, low cost of nothing. And Heretic: Serpent Riders, Hexen: Beyond Heretic, and Hexen: Deathkings of the Dark Citadel are all on sale.\nAdd on Doom 64 as one of the current Epic Games freebies, and it's a heck of a week to pick up some older games for cheap.\nLet's do the time warp again\nQuake actually received an update today, and yes, I mean the classic Quake. Threewave Capture the Flag hits Quake today, bringing back the classic mode and nine resurrected maps.\nThe Bethesda blog covers some of the history behind Threewave CTF, a mod that wound up being quite influential over the history of Quake. Now, the mod is available for free as part of the enhanced Quake re-release. It even comes with some enhancements, like a status display for your flag and some improved lighting and fog effects.\nQuakeCon '22 is underway now, with more panels and streams expected in the coming days. You can find a handy schedule of all the upcoming events here, and follow them live on the Bethesda Twitch channel.\nThe post Wolfenstein 3D, Quake 4, and more hit Game Pass for PC today as QuakeCon kicks off appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The sequel to the beloved life sim is ready for early access\nSimulation fans rejoice, because Slime Rancher 2 is nearly here. It's been over five years since the first game's release, and fans are itching to dive back into the cozy, adorable world of the Far Far Range. The beloved open-world, FPS life sim is back, and this time, it's going to be better than ever. Slime Rancher 2 will not only be a big graphical improvement over its predecessor, but will also build on the mechanics, characters, and world of the first game as well.\nhttps://twitter.com/slimerancher/status/1560310764321341441\nWith the early access build, players won't get to see all of the \"features, slimes, environments, items, story, etc.\" that the full game will have to offer, Nick Popovich, the Slime Rancher series director, said in a Reddit post detailing what we can expect. \"If you're someone who wants to play through a game all at once in a complete state,\" he continues, \"you can simply wait until the full game is released at a later date.\"\nBasically, the early access version of Slime Rancher 2 will have a lot missing, but if you've just been champing at the bit to play it all this time, it'll definitely be worth it to check the game out early.\nSlime Rancher 2 officially hits early access on September 22, and is available to wish list now on Steam and the Epic Games Store. The game will also be available on Xbox Series X/S.\nI'm usually more of a full-release person, like Popovich was talking about, but I have to admit that I'm tempted to load up Slime Rancher 2 the minute it's available. We have no shortage of relaxing games coming out this year, so between this and Ooblets both coming out in the next few weeks, I'm gonna be set until Christmas.\nThe post Slime Rancher 2 goes into early access next month appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's yet another game that mixes two of my favorite genres, and the game's bright colors, soothing music, and chill gameplay are likely going to make for one of the most relaxing gaming experiences of the year.\nThe Ooblets team at Glumberland excitedly took to Twitter to announce that they're finally ready to release version 1.0 of the game, which will be launching on Nintendo Switch, PC (via the Epic Store), Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on September 1.\nThey also thanked all the players who played the game in early access since it went live in July of 2020, further assisting the team in getting the game to its official release. Both digital and physical pre-orders are now available -- the latter also comes with a host of goodies like a map, postcards, and a stick sheet.\nhttps://twitter.com/ooblets/status/1560250546870571009\nI can't think of a better way to kick off fall than playing a cozy, adorable little game like this on my Switch. It's been really cool to see the game progress through the development process over the years, and the team's openness on social media gave us an in-depth look at how much work it really takes to make a great game.\nThere has been some controversy online about how they have handled some situations surrounding the game's development and release, like the announcement that Ooblets would be exclusive to the Epic Games Store upon release. Either way, the game still looks amazing, and I'll be looking forward to playing it upon release.\nThe post Ooblets is finally getting a full release after six years in development appeared first on Destructoid.",

The cartoonish comedy-shooter will still arrive in 2022, but the team has decided to delay it to December 13, 2022.\nOriginally set to arrive in October, the Squanch crew says it is working hard towards developing the best experience possible. These extra six weeks will provide some time to squash bugs and tune up.\nAs part of the delay, Squanch published a special animation as an apology. It's basically a short little sketch, which you can watch below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CdTKrm-_1Q\nHigh on Life is still targeting a launch on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Windows PC, with a day one launch on Xbox Game Pass for cloud, console, and PC.\nDon't leave me high\nSquanch Games is the studio co-founded by Justin Roiland, a co-creator of Rick & Morty and the Hulu series Solar Opposites. So if the humor above feels familiar to you, that's probably why.\nGiven the game's earlier trailers, High On Life looks to be a mix of sci-fi shooter and Roiland's particular brand of comedy, with a lot of odd and bizarre humor mashing up with alien creatures.\nThe game's story looks to feature all kinds of bizarre moments, from talking guns to an alien cartel. Plus, selling humans as a kind of drug for extraterrestrial life.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SUUeakHKTk\nEven though the comedy looks to be a big focus, there's some cool platforming, powers, and gun design happening in the trailers for High On Life. It's a bit out of this world, but Squanch is going to use the delay to squash all the bugs it can and make sure the punchlines land.\nHigh on Life is now aiming for a December 13 launch on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.\nThe post High On Life tacks on a slight delay, now set for this December appeared first on Destructoid.",

A digital release will hit PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch in Japan on December 15, with a physical edition to follow on PS4 and Switch only.\nOriginally released in 2010, Akai Katana is a horizontally scrolling shmup that features dynamic visuals, melodramatic lore, and a pulse-pounding soundtrack that are the trademark of the Cave oeuvre. The bullet hell epic tells the story of a band of freedom fighters, sick of having their people sacrificed to the titular artifact, who rise up against their tyrannical oppressors in a bid for absolute freedom.\nCheck out a preview of Akai Katana Shin from April's FES 2022 stream. The action starts at 33:30.\nhttps://youtu.be/yNZTTM3sZG4?t=1997\nThe new release will feature an authentic edition of the original release, alongside a fully rebalanced edition of the arcade classic complete with widescreen aspect ratio and new in-game mechanics. From these early details, it seems that this 2022 release will be similar to the Xbox 360 port, released by Rising Star Games back in 2011. While there is no official word of a western localization, City Connection has noted that the release will support multiple languages, including English, French, and Spanish.\nAkai Katana Shin launches December 15 on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Cave’s Akai Katana Shin is getting a re-release in December appeared first on Destructoid.",

The indie hit will finally make its console debut on October 18, arriving on PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms. The console edition will be published by Modus Games.\nAs we have reported many, many times in the past, Them's Fightin' Herds is a one-on-one 2D fighting title that began life as an unofficial adaptation of the smash hit TV series My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. After Hasbro's lawyers came a'calling, the show's creator, Lauren Faust, kindly reached out to the team to help with the design of an all-new cast of characters, which allowed the developer to continue the project as an original IP.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgaqb7RNb-0\nLaunching in Steam Early Access way back in 2018, before eventually receiving a full release in 2020, console players have had to sit pretty for almost five years for the console port, but now finally have a date with which to mark their calendars. With a charismatic roster, quality animation, and tight Marvel vs. Capcom-esque mechanics, TFH has successfully built a dedicated community of players, as well as a healthy competitive scene. This community is only set to grow with the arrival of the console port.\nThem's Fightin' Herds launches on PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms October 18, priced at $19.99. A Deluxe Edition — including a season pass hosting four additional characters, new stages, and a selection of lobby avatars — will retail for $39.99.

          "description": "Wallflower Power\nBandai Namco has released its newest update for its excellent 3D scrapper Tekken 7 — Update 5.00 not only brings with it a fresh round of balance tweaks for the entire roster but also welcomes brand new \"Wall Crush\" tech, increasing a fighter's combo options once they have cornered their hapless opponent.\nEvery character on Tekken 7's mammoth roster now has maneuvers designated as \"Wall Crush Inducing Hit\" or \"Wall Crush Inducing Guard\" moves. When a fighter is able to push their opposition against a solid surface, applying the former will cause a wall splat, which increases the opponent's recovery time and opens them up for further assault. This new mechanic is different from Tekken's standard wall-splat mechanic and is intended as a \"bridge\" of sorts between combos.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrYJ4qHjCsY\nIf you find yourself on the receiving end of a wall crush, all is not lost. You don't have to necessarily become your enemy's punching bag — wall crush does allow the defending party to block the incoming damage, but the recovery on the animation is long, and the player will likely find themselves stuck in a new blockstring. As such, the new mechanic will force players to be better aware of their surroundings, and utilize side-step maneuvers to prevent themselves from being cornered.\nAs for the balance changes, there have been tweaks to a whole host of Tekken superstars, including heavy-hitters Lidia Sobieska, Fahkumram, and the endlessly troublesome Leroy Smith. For full details, check out the Tekken 7 Update 5.0 patch notes right here.

I mean, Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury kinda counts, but that was over a year ago at this point! It would be cool to see if the follow-up uses the same formula for the Bowser's Fury portion of the game; which felt like a precursor of what's to come.\nOr, we could get the safe and relatively surefire Super Mario Odyssey 2. It did incredibly well for Nintendo, and there's plenty of innovation to be had there, from level designs, to things Cappy can command, to mechanical iterations. Some form of multiplayer would be fantastic to see as well.\nThen there's the left-field new thing.

This distribution will run through August 21 at 23:59 UTC, so you do have a bit to find your copy of Pokemon Sword and Shield. That's actually the day that the World Championship event ends.\nWe've been saying it for a little while now, but this could be one of the final distribution events for Sword and Shield as the door closes on that generation. Scarlet and Violet will take over later in 2022, and although there should be a few initial Sword and Shield distribution events, everything will cycle to the newest gen sometime in 2023.\nIf you're interested in attending the event locally, there's a 2022 Worlds registration page here that has all the information you need. Competition registration is now closed as of August 17, but you can still attend the tournament if you want.\nThe post PSA: Pokemon is running a free Victini distribution for a few days appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "(But only three people have completed it)\nBandai Namco and developer FromSoftware have proudly announced that their punishing fantasy RPG, Elden Ring, has surpassed an incredible 16.6 million sales since its initial launch on in February of this year. The recent sales figure was featured in the publisher's most recent financial report, as featured by Japanese site Gamebiz.\nLaunching February 25 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms following a hugely hyped development period, Elden Ring absolutely delivered the high-fantasy, high-difficulty, deep-lore adventure expected by the FromSoft fan community. The beneficiary of high critical praise and extremely positive word-of-mouth, Elden Ring has found itself spinning in the drives of both FromSoft veterans and newcomers alike — well en route to being one of 2022's best-selling and plaudit-winning releases.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOrtKh8Vv3g\nElden Ring sees players take up the mantle of a fully customizable warrior, who journeys through a dark, open-world universe filled with both steel-swinging opponents and truly nightmarish monsters and demons. As the protagonist progresses through The Lands Between, they will encounter numerous allies and enemies, as they evolve their mastery of magic and combat — all building toward an encounter with the indomitable Queen Marika and the capturing of the realm-conquering title of Elden Lord.\nConsidered one of the best-reviewed video games of all time, Elden Ring received 10/10 scores from numerous gaming outlets, (including right here on the good ship Destructoid),. This praise has played no small part in the staggering sales achieved over the past six months. How much higher this number climbs over the remainder of 2022 remains to be seen, but the winter award season will likely bolster the overall sales figure some distance.\nElden Ring is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post Elden Ring has hit a staggering 16.6 million sales appeared first on Destructoid.",

On paper, it looks like it'll have the same basic two-lane layout as the core one, but with a few changes.\nWhat's different about the new Pokemon Unite map Theia Sky Runs:\nRayquaza is the boss in the middle\nJungling will be different, with new layouts\nIt has a new aesthetic\nIt's not a complete departure from the norm, which is honestly OK.

After a year of playing on the same tired arena, it'll be great to finally get another option.\nOf course, details are very slim, as is customary for the game. The only tease we're given is to \"stay tuned for future information,\" so it's unclear how this map will rotate, or if it'll completely take over the original battleground for a while.\nAs usual, the Japanese Pokemon Unite site has a page upfront beyond the sole tweet from the English account.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdmbokV5qak\nThe post Pokemon Unite is finally getting a new core map appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "\"We're not considering that at this point\"\nNintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa has been relatively accessible since he took over, and this past week, he spoke to financial outlet Nikkei about the lack of a Nintendo Switch price hike for the foreseeable future. Well, that's the plan anyway.\nFurukawa noted that they are \"not considering\" a Nintendo Switch price hike \"at this point,\" with two factors in play. The chief concern is \"pricing people out,\" given that they're aiming to expand their market and play the long game (Nintendo has also comfortably been in a position of being the cheapest mainstream gaming hardware throughout its history).\nAnother potential way the blow has been softened is through software sales, given that Nintendo also produces games that they want to keep viable with a large install base. Nintendo says that they want to \"maintain the momentum\" of the Switch so far. The issue apparently isn't with the actual innards of the Switch, but rather that \"demand exceeds supply.\"\nSo how are they staying the course without a price hike? Furukawa concedes that the \"OLED model will continue to be less profitable than our other models,\" because \"costs have undoubtedly increased for shipping not only by air, but also by sea.\" But he also notes: \"The weak yen may be seen as a benefit for Nintendo, since such a large share of our sales comes from abroad, but our overseas promotional and staff costs also go up. We're making more inventory purchases in foreign currencies to counter that.\"\n[Update: Nikkei also reports that Nintendo is reducing their packaging materials by 20% for the Switch, to help with \"transportation efficiency,\" and allow more use of air mail (as well as more shelf space). Right now Nintendo is trying this strategy with the original Switch model.\"]\nThe post Nintendo president says no Switch price hike is coming (Update) appeared first on Destructoid.",

Online retailer Amazon has opened a new listing for the \"Is it even happening?\" release, complete with a launch date of February 3, 2023.\n\nThe listing includes box art, screenshots, and a game description, which is more than anybody has seen of Dead Island 2 from publisher Deep Silver or developer Dambuster Studios. According to Amazon, the sequel is ready to rock on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, (current and last-gen), and will, once again, see players choose from a selection of characters before engaging in gory, open-world mayhem on the streets of a plague-ridden Los Angeles. The blurb also suggests that the heroes themselves are infected, and can utilize the zombie inside them to unleash further carnage.\n\nIt's the best evidence yet that Dead Island 2 is not only still on deck, but is, apparently, mere months away from launch. Originally announced with a memorable teaser trailer at E3 2014, the sequel has since bounced through several studios and has been subject to an array of cancellation rumors. Can the long-awaited title deliver after being mired in development hell? It seems, according to Amazon at least, that we really don't have to wait too much longer to find out.\nWith Gamescom on the horizon, I would expect that we'll be hearing some official news from Deep Silver in the very near future.\nDead Island 2 is currently in development at Dambuster Studios.\nThe post Dead Island 2 listed on Amazon with art, screens, and Feb 2023 date appeared first on Destructoid.",

The wacky multiplayer survival action game led with PS4 and PS5 as its only platforms, but GungHo Online and Supertrick Games confirmed a PC version in a live developer stream with Uncle Death.\nA couple of weeks ago, Deathverse committed to a fall 2022 release window, after previously eying a spring launch. The delay came about in the wake of an open beta test.\n\"We got a lot of data from the beta,\" explained game director Hideyuki Shin, \"and we're planning to make as many adjustments as we can.\"\nSome of the world-building vibes and close-up combat antics will feel familiar to Let It Die fans, but Deathverse has carved out a different path with 16-player Death Jamboree matches, in which participants try to stay alive long enough to duke it out in the Showdown Zone. All the while, powerful hunters can join the fray, and cryptids — including the chupacabra and jackalope — mingle with the hyperviolent contestants.\n[caption id=\"attachment_340294\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1920\"] Weapons are important, but don't neglect fashion.[/caption]\nThe goal is to be bold enough to earn GP (Good Points) and power up, but not be so bold that you bite off more than you can chew and get taken out. Classic battle royale strats.\nLet It Die surprisingly ended up having the right stuff — it accumulated millions of players. Whether Deathverse: Let It Die can capture lightning in a bottle again, I'm not so sure, but anything's possible. Having the game accessible on not just PS4/PS5, but also Steam, where free-to-play audiences have a chance to really snowball, feels crucial.\nIf nothing else, it warms my heart to know that Uncle Death's still a jokester.\nThe post Deathverse: Let It Die is also coming to PC appeared first on Destructoid.",

Well, the dream of an open-world Iron Man game almost became reality, according to a MinnMax interview with Christofer Sundberg, founder of Avalanche Studios (who are best known for the Just Cause series).\nhttps://twitter.com/MinnMaxShow/status/1559927528264966146?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetemb…",

And even as someone who's not exactly \"into\" real-world escape rooms, it ended up being a fun, not-too-frustrating time with memorable scenarios like a room with rising water, or a scramble to find an antidote after being poisoned. I'd recommend Escape Academy — particularly after today's update, which includes FOV options and a much-needed change to avoid accidental hints.\nIf you're just here for the field-of-view slider, you can now crank the FOV from 60 all the way up to 120. That also goes for the console versions of Escape Academy — I tested it out on my PlayStation 5 copy this morning. I'll probably settle somewhere in the middle. You…",

Considering the industry is more flooded with titles to choose from than ever before, it can be difficult to branch outside of the comfort zones of our favorite genres because there's so much to play. No judgment — it honestly just gets me more enthused that I could have the opportunity to introduce someone to some of my favorite games of all time.

It features a widescreen mode, improved cinematic quality, and a few bug fixes. A Japanese version also exists, but we need more information about it to support it.

You can also download a demo here.  If you encounter any issues, please submit them to the issue tracker!\n>",
