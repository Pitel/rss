Yet despite its work with Nintendo, Good Feel is still an independent company and occasionally produces new games with its own IP, and at the very end of November 2023 the studio released Switch-exclusive Otogi Katsugeki Mameda no Bakeru: Oracle Saitarou no Sainan!!.\nTaking strongly after the Ganbare Goemon games (Etsunobu Ebisu worked at Konami before founding Good-Feel in 2005 and was a key figure behind the Mystical Ninja series), this new release mixes 3D platforming with some light beat-'em-up elements to make for an impressively enjoyable experience.

Now there's too many things to look at in advance, but hey, I'm making steady progress, and you've probably seen the fruits of a couple of these this week already. Next on the list is Dystopika, a toy-like sandbox citybuilder that's sort of in the same vein as the lovely Summerhouse I played earlier this week, but also lives at the exact opposite end of the mood and vibes scale. Whereas Summerhouse is about creating diddly little cute streets with sunny Mediterranean vibes, Dystopika is effectively: Build Your Own Blade Runner. \nRead more",

That means a full selection of DLSS, FSR and XeSS upscalers, plus DLSS 3 frame generation. Real yakuza might use a gamepad, but it seems real fuzz-haired RPG fantasists use graphics cards.\nLet’s take a closer look, then, at how RGG’s latest crime caper performs on PC.

I also say this as someone who's never played or understood a game of poker in her life, because let's face it, regular poker is quite boring. Balatro, on the other hand, is poker that's turbo-charged with magic Joker cards, tarot card multipliers, and blind conditions that make a successful hand increasingly tricky to pull off.

But it wasn't till I embraced the holy medium of videogames that I realised the full potential of balldom. \r\n\n\r\nInitiated, of course, by Sonic the Hedgehog, I descended into a frothing ballpit of ball variations, encompassing everything from the squashy rolling UFOs of Exo One through Katamari Damacy to the overcrowded chutes of Marble World and the spectacle of Overwatch's Hammond clearing out a capture point by means of sheer, delicious torque.

Roots isn't one of your traditional, SimCity-derived town sims in which you steadily colonise a single map (at least, until you lose patience with your glittering urban creation and press the Godzilla or Hurricane button). As per the roguelike element, it's a game about being on the run. \r\n\n\r\nIn Roots, you take charge of a band of warriors fleeing an expanding purple smog, the Ginnungagap, in a flying longship. To escape its coils, you must land on floating islands, play cards to raise settlements, and harvest energy for your vessel from the titular roots of the World Tree. Succumb to the advancing mists, and you'll time-rewind back to your Holt to unlock new mechanics and upgrades. There are also various big-league mythological celebrities to meet and recruit, and a variety of randomised encounters and events to shake up each run. Here's the launch trailer.\r\n\n Read more",

Great building, a sense of scale, a beautiful atmosphere, and the ability to die in extremely stupid ways. In Minecraft, it's digging straight down into lava. In Valheim, it's getting crushed by the very tree you'd just chopped down. And after dying for the third time by trying to climb a slightly-too-steep hill, slipping down and building enough momentum to send me careening off the cliff to my death, I realised that Enshrouded, too, ticks all the boxes for maybe one day being listed among the titans of the genre.\nOne paragraph in, and I've already compared Enshrouded to Valheim. You'll see that quite a bit throughout this review, and for good reason. Enshrouded has come the closest for me to recapturing that feeling of when the world collectively discovered Valheim for the first time. But that's both an accolade and a reservation. Because it's not quite there... yet.\n Read more",

          "description": "Basically the only sort of strategy games I like are city builders, so I was interested in the playtest for El Dorado: The Golden City Builder, which casts you as the leader of an ancient Mayan-ish city. The playtest is only the prologue, but the eventual goal is to take over the Yucatán peninsula, and if nothing else it's refreshing to see a city-builder that doesn't feel overwhelmingly European. It also has a complicated system of religion. Whereas in a similarly polytheistic game like Zeus, the gods would turn up to stomp on buildings and/or bless them, at fairly large intervals, in El Dorado I was getting a home immolated every few days. Building shrines that have an area of effect, and that require resources to run and protect your town, is its own supply chain in El Dorado. This is a very interesting idea that I liked.\nBut. The aforementioned deities are figures from Maya mythology, and the Yucatán peninsula is the bit where the Mayans lived, so I just find it a bit sus the word \"Mayan\" does not appear anywhere on the Steam page or in the press release materials. Sometimes said materials say \"the Yucatán peninsula\", and sometimes \"the mystical land of Jukatan\", which could well be an innocent translation mistake, but doesn't make me less sus. I've hedged my bets by saying \"Mayan-ish\" - just as an uncharitable person could say the devs are doing...\nRead more",

          "description": "For a series that's defined by its trials and elaborate murder cases, the greatest crime in Ace Attorney history is arguably one we never get to see or take part in. Okay, maybe crime is too strong a word. Miscarriage of justice is perhaps more appropriate, and specifically that of Apollo Justice, the cover star of this latest trilogy in Capcom's beloved lawyer 'em up. Except poor old Apollo isn't really what holds this collection of Ace Attorneys 4, 5 and 6 together at all. Sure, he features in all of them, but at the end of the day, it's still the series' original bluffer supreme Phoenix Wright who heads up most of the casework here, relegating his new protegee back to bench-warming duties almost as soon as Apollo's debut game rolls its credits. What's more, he quickly has to share that space with Athena Cykes, another new hotshot lawyer that enters the firm in Dual Destinies and continues the scrappy defence trifecta in Spirit Of Justice.\nThe result is a set of games that feel considerably wobblier than Capcom's first and more robust Ace Attorney trilogy, and quite a bit more unfocused than the more recent Victorian-era spin-off, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles. But despite a slightly unsure start, there are still plenty of career highs to be found here for Wright, Cykes and Justice, and Spirit Of Justice in particular remains one of the series' best entries to date. Those new to Ace Attorney should absolutely begin their journey elsewhere, but for series completionists, the Apollo Justice Trilogy is quite the welcome development.\nRead more",

Right now, it's doing almost twice the numbers of Steam's usual chart-topper Counter-Strike 2. We have entered the Pal Age, it seems - but how long will the feeding frenzy last? How much is owing to it releasing during the quiet time of year with a meme-ish premise, while capitalising on pent-up demand for a proper PC version of Nintendo's monster-catching series?

Forecasts had turned. Many areas expected to get dusted went untouched. But me, after six hours of walking over thin, old snow, the good stuff finally started to fall as I entered a wood and approached a waterfall. Pretty magic, really. It was so cold that snow settled on my shoulders and my hair froze. Perfect. That's what I craved. Anyway, what are you playing this weekend? Here's what we're clicking on!\nRead more",

          "description": "For a game that's been repeatedly described as \"Pokémon with machineguns\", the first thing that strikes me about Palworld is just how un-Pokémon-like it actually is. To its credit, it does do quite a good Pokémon Legends: Arceus impression when you first step out on its big, Breath Of The Wild-style hilltop and take in the open world vista of its monster-stuffed starting continent. But if the opening moments of washing up on the island in nothing but your very scantily clad undies hadn't already given it away (seriously, why do shipwrecks always destroy the clothes you had on, but not your smalls underneath?), then the ream of tutorial prompts about punching trees to get more wood, building bases, putting pals to work on said bases, and the endless parade of crafting technologies you'll need to unlock to actually do anything on this godforsaken rock will quickly pull the wool clear away from your hopeful little face. \nFor underneath the cute round eyes of its cover stars, Palworld is really a survival game wearing the dead skin suits of Game Freak's catch 'em all monster friends. In a lot of cases, those skin suits are quite literal, such are the blatant palette swaps and so-close-to-copyright-infringement-I-can't-believe-Nintendo's-lawyers-haven't-shut-this-down-years-ago rip-off creatures on display here. For that reason alone, Palworld can feel about as soulless and cynical as it comes. But that's not the worst of it. Even aside from all the survival gubbins, base building and sweatshop automation practices shoved down your throat, Palworld is just an awful example of monster-catching games in general. If it's a Pokémon game on PC you're after, go and play Cassette Beasts. Go and play Coromon, TemTem, or Monster Sanctuary. Anything but this. \nRead more",

          "description": "If you're a fan of the Mega Man Zero series but always thought it was a tad slow, you'll want to keep an eye on Berserk Boy. The action-platformer from the appropriately-named BerserkBoy Games is coming to Nintendo Switch and PC on March 6. \n\n\nAhead of its release, the devs have shared a new trailer that confirms the launch date and shows off a bunch of fast-paced action. Throw in a mix of Saturday morning anime cinematics and you have a pretty compelling reason to go berserk yourself. \n\n\n\n\nBerserk Boy is Mega Man meets Sonic the Hedgehog\n\n\nTrue to its inspirations, which appear to range from the Mega Man series to Sonic the Hedgehog, Berserk Boy ticks all the expected bullet points. There's jumping, dashing, and sliding. There are different abilities to harness and toggle between, including Lightning, Fire, Earth, Air, and Ice. There's even a mad scientist and his \"army of darkness\" to contend with. I'm a simple man, I don't ask for much more of a setup than that. \n\n\nThe tunes have a solid pedigree to them, too. The Berserk Boy soundtrack comes from Tee Lopes, known for work on Streets of Rage 4, Sonic Mania, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge, and more. The real standout for me, though, is the speed. It looks like there's a nice mix of combo-chaining, acrobatic challenges and, of course, rail-sliding. We'll see if it lives up to all the games that paved the way for it when Berserk Boy lands this March.  \n\nThe post Berserk Boy looks like a high-speed spin on Mega Man Zero appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "“WHELP. IT HAPPENED,” begins the tweet from Lilith Walther (b0tster on Twitter), one of the developers behind Bloodborne Kart, a fanmade spin-off of the popular FromSoftware game. Sony has allegedly contacted them requesting the removal of copyrighted content from the game.\n\n\n“Long story short I need to scrub the branding off of what was previously known as Bloodborne Kart, which we will do. But that requires a short delay,” they continue. However, they add that “the game is still coming out! It'll just look slightly different.”\n\n\n\n\nIt’s not entirely surprising since the Bloodborne Kart directly references the title of the 2015 PS4 game and includes characters from it. The game is a “meme made real,” originating from an April Fool’s Day Tweet back in 2021. What is surprising is that it has taken so long, as the game has been in open development for quite some time now. It’s perhaps because, a few months ago, it was given the release date of January 31, which is next week.\n\n\nOf course, the developers were planning to release the game for free, but it’s still infringing on the company’s copyright. It’s honestly not at all surprising, which Lilith states themself in another tweet, saying, “Like I've said in multiple interviews, we were all expecting this to happen so we could be pleasantly surprised if it didn't.”\n\n\nIt’s definitely a bummer, and I feel bad for the development team who were looking forward to putting their creation in the hands of fans, but they’re taking it in stride. Lilith says, “Turning this into an original game that we have full creative control over is kind of exciting. This is a fan game no more!”\n\n\nLilith says that they are current uncertain of what the new release date will be for the rebranded Bloodborne Kart, but they hope to share news as soon as possible.\n\nThe post After warning from Sony, Bloodborne Kart is dropping references to the brand appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "During the Warframe Devstream 176, developer Digital Extremes revealed plans for the next big update, Dante Unbound. Scheduled to release in March 2024, the update will bring the 56th Warframe to the popular action RPG MMO.\n\n\nImage via Digital Extremes\n\n\n56th Warframe: Dante, Master of Reality's Pages\n\n\nThe highlight of the new update is of course the new Warframe, Dante. Described as a classic-MMO caster, Dante is accompanied by his own Exalted Weapon, Noctua. A Dante-bound Grimoire, Noctua obliterates enemies by pelting them with spectral pages and cursed paper cuts. I have to admit, being cut up by cursed pages of a magical spellbook sounds pretty brutal.\n\n\nThe living sandstorm Warframe Inaros is also getting a long overdue rework with the update, with full details on the rework to come soon.\n\n\nQuality-of-life updates and return of TennoGen\n\n\nTennoGen, a unique system in Warframe comprised of unique customizations created by fellow Warframe players, is finally making a return in the March update. TennoGen is essentially a collaborative program between community artists and Digital Extremes developers to add purchasable cosmetics to the game while sharing revenue with the artists who created them.\n\n\nThe TennoGen system has been updated, and will now accept submissions under the new Entrati style that was added in the recent Whispers in the Walls update that was released in December. Fans will now be able to create Warframe skins, Weapon skins, Operator accessories, Landing Craft skins, and more as part of Tennogen.\n\n\nDante looks like a pretty cool caster Warframe, so I'm excited to hear more. The Dante Unbound update for Warframe will release in March 2024.\n\nThe post Warframe Dante Unbound update set for March, adds 56th Warframe appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Mr. Podunkian revealed the Steam store page for their upcoming city life simulator, Sunkissed City, which is coming to PC sometime in late 2024.\n\n\nUnfortunately, it doesn’t look like the handheld version of The Urbz. Nor does it look like the console version of The Urbz. It looks more like Stardew Valley, which makes sense because Mr. Podunkian previously worked at Stardew Valley developer Concerned Ape. If you liked Stardew Valley, but felt like it needed more concrete, then this might be for you.\n\n\nIn Sunkissed City, you don’t actually live in a place called “Sunkissed City.” It’s Apollo City, which is similar. There you take care of DIY gardens, get to know the locals, and try to solve the mystery of why everyone has been feeling crappy. There’s even fishing, which I think is maybe a law for developing these sorts of games. You can also play co-op with friends if you're that sort of person.\n\n\nI’m liking the looks of Sunkissed City. I like farming sims, but having grown up in a rural area, I prefer being an urban dweller because food is closer, and I don’t drive. While I’m still waiting for someone to adapt the gentle mix of adventure game and life simulator found in the handheld versions of The Urbz, that’s a different matter. For now, I’ll just be happy if I’m able to space out at the magazine rack at the 7/11 around midnight.\n\n\nSunkissed City is currently targeting a release at the end of 2024.\n\nThe post Sunkissed City is an urban life sim with shades of Stardew Valley appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Well, it looks like more Switch successor rumors are swirling. A new report has emerged today stating that the Switch 2 (or whatever it ends up being called) is indeed targeting a 2024 release, and with an LCD screen. \n\n\nThe news comes from Takashi Mochizuki and Yuki Furukawa of Bloomberg. The duo cited Hiroshi Hayase, an analyst for Omdia. Hayase states that Nintendo intends to double the production of \"amusement displays\" throughout 2024. They also noted that the sequel system would feature an 8-inch LCD screen. The Switch OLED, released over two years ago, houses a 7-inch screen, and the original Switch houses a 6.2-inch LCD screen.\n\n\n\n\nOmdia is a London-based consultancy firm focused on telecommunications, media, and technology. Sure, it's just another analyst (albeit a credible one) saying the next Nintendo console is coming soon. But all of the more recent Switch successor rumors are beginning to line up. \n\n\nAlso noted in today's Bloomberg article is a reminder that Shark Corp., an LCD panel supplier, was revealed to be supplying LCD screens for an upcoming gaming console. The company has an established relationship with Nintendo, as they worked to assemble Switch consoles during the pandemic.\n\n\nIf 2024 is indeed when we can expect Nintendo's next console, we could hopefully be hearing something relatively soon. The Switch was showcased in trailer form on October 20, 2016. That's less than five months before the Nintendo Switch launched on March 7, 2017.\n\n\nIf we go by the logic of history repeating itself and assume that a Switch 2 will be out before the kickoff of holiday shopping around Black Friday, we may be seeing Nintendo making an official reveal of their wildly popular hybrid console around mid-June. Just in time for this year's Summer Game Fest and other gaming events. We'll have to wait and see.\n\nThe post Report suggests Switch 2 will launch with an 8-inch LCD screen appeared first on Destructoid.",

It seems the studio is on the hunt for additional talent, just months after last August's layoffs. \n\n\nAs reported by VGC, Twitter user MauroNL – a games industry analyst – has noted that Striking Distance is embarking on a new venture. A total of nine vacancies have become available, with the studio intending to create something brand-new.\n\n\n\n\nSome of the positions include a Lead Technical Artist, UI Technical Artist, Lead Gameplay Animator, and a Lead Gameplay Engineer. What this elusive project will be is anyone's guess at this stage.\n\n\nCan only go up from here, yeah?\n\n\nWith 32 people being laid off from the studio and director Glen Schofield leaving last September, things didn't look good for Striking Distance. The Callisto Protocol should have been a slam-dunk, particularly with it being billed as a spiritual successor to Dead Space.\n\n\nHowever, poor performance left people unimpressed with the developer's first release. While recent scores on Steam have it at \"Mostly Positive,\" overall it remains \"Mixed.\" Even with patches to fix issues, the damage appeared to have already been done.\n\n\nNow that a new game is said to be in the works, maybe some will give Callisto Protocol another chance.

It released on January 25 and, according to the Nintendo website, this version features \"gameplay improvements inspired by later games in the series,\" including Instinct Mode.\n\n\n\n\nIt's also been given an \"an artful redesign of a stealth-action classic,\" which has been specially adapted for the hybrid console.\n\n\nNot bad for an 18-year-old game\n\n\nThe timing of this is pretty nifty (if you have a Switch, of course).

This one shows the new game side-by-side with the 1990 original.\n\n\nIf there’s one thing gamers love, it’s comparing things. Shadow of the Ninja is the oldest game that Tengo Project has remade from Natsume’s back catalog, and being on the NES, it was built on limited hardware. Rather than simply spruce up the game like with Wild Guns: Reloaded or create an entirely new entry in the series like Pocky & Rocky Reshrined, they’ve kind of found a comfortable place in between. The levels are reminiscent of the original, but everything has been overhauled with new abilities and enemy placement.\n\n\n\n\nI think it looks pretty great! Placed next to the remake, the 8-bit original looks incredibly sparse. It was actually a decent-looking game for the time period, but the NES was very restrictive when it came to how much you could jam on screen at one time. Tengo Project has already shown off some great pixel art chops with their previous games.\n\n\nThe remake will have new weapons, a new level, and an upgraded soundtrack by the original composer, Iku Mizutani.\n\n\nI wonder where Tengo Project will go next. My first guess would be S.C.A.T., but what I’m really hoping for is Abadox. I guess we should wait and see how Shadow of the Ninja - Reborn turns out.\n\n\nShadow of the Ninja - Reborn is coming to Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC in Summer 2024.\n\nThe post Shadow of the Ninja – Reborn has a new trailer comparing it to the NES version appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Back in December, the social deduction phenomenon Among Us crossed over with Vampire Survivors. The result was a surprisingly fun (and cheap) DLC called Emergency Meeting that launched on every available platform....except Switch. \n\n\nThankfully, that's changed as of this week.\n\n\nPoncle confirms that the Among Us DLC and Adventures are now live on Switch\n\n\nThanks to a tweet from developer poncle, we have full confirmation that Emergency Meeting and Adventures are live on Switch.\n\n\nSo I mentioned that the Among Us DLC was cheap. How cheap? Try $2.50, with a 10% discount through the rest of the month (January 29 at 2:59AM ET to be exact). Note, however, that you may need to search for the Emergency Meeting DLC directly on the eShop, as the official shop page doesn't list it yet.\n\n\nAdventures are the other big addition to the Switch version and include extra quests and challenges (which are essentially remixed versions of existing content). Adventures are free on all platforms, but you will need to own the appropriate DLC to play the DLC portions.\n\n\nInterestingly enough, all versions of the game (Steam, Switch, Xbox, iOS, and Android) now have feature parity...except the bizarre Tesla edition of the game, which just got the wintery Whiteout update several weeks ago.\n\nThe post After a delay, the Switch finally has the Vampire Survivors Among Us/Adventure Mode DLC appeared first on Destructoid.",

If the pirate game has managed to keep you curious all this time, look out for the open access running from February 8 until 11. \n\n\nIt is worth noting that Ubisoft+ games can grab the game earlier on February 13. You have several choices including PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Amazon Luna, and PC via Epic where you can enjoy crossplay and cross-progression throughout the platforms. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\nSkull & Bones in 2024\n\n\nThe game is an open-world tactical action world title with both single and multiplayer elements. For those looking to play the multiplayer aspects, there will be stronger items introduced to help you take on the increasingly difficult opponents, including warships. \n\n\nYou'll be able to grow your empire by taking control of trade routes. There are also hostile takeovers where the winners get to take control of manufacturing plants. At post-launch, new features will be introduced, including the ability to assign fleets of ships to your trade routes, to the ability to bribe officials. \n\n\n\n\nIs this the pirate game we've been waiting ages for? February 8 we'll learn whether it has the chance to live up to the hype of years of waiting. \n\nThe post Skull & Bones open beta begins February 8 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Hundreds of thousands of words, dialogue trees that stretch to the horizon and take into account successes and failures, trying to fit in as many characters as possible to suit different preferences; the complexity piles up and threatens to collapse. It gets more difficult when you try to merge it with another genre.\n\n\nI’ve seen failure happen many times throughout my years as Destructoid’s resident self-proclaimed dating sim expert. There’s a reason why games like Mass Effect usually have relationships no more complex than “listen to life story, complete side quest, bang.” Anything more ambitious leads to juggling problems, and it takes a lot of talent and planning to handle all those balls.\n\n\nNova Hearts is a game that, s…",

What I didn't expect, however, was the massive scope of the game.\n\n\nIf you haven't played it—you really owe it to yourself to—Dyson Sphere Program basically drops you onto a planet in a bigger solar system, where you have to build up functioning factories to harvest the resources on the planet and tech up.

          "description": "If you thought the idea of a live-action Final Fantasy XIV series sounded like a massive undertaking, you'd be right. One of the executive producers, Dinesh Shamdasani of Hivemind Entertainment, recently confirmed that the project has been canceled. \n\n\nWhen asked about the status of the live-action Final Fantasy XIV on Twitter, Shamdasani straight up said it's \"dead.\" While they had a \"fantastic pilot script\" by Ben Lustig and Jake Thornton (Winter's Knight) and a multi-season plan, everything was rejected. According to Shamdasani, it was the risk inherent to the \"size and scale\" of the project that ultimately did it in. Apparently, Amazon came the closest to footing the bill for this one. \n\n\n\n\nWriter Jake Thornton chimed in, as well, citing Covid as one of the culprits behind the decision. \"We took it out just as studios began to zip up their purse strings,\" Thornton added. \n\n\nAs for whether or not animation would be more suitable for something like Final Fantasy XIV, Shamdasani was quick to put an end to any further hope for the series, at least for now. Not only did he say that animation would be more difficult, he mentioned that they no longer have the rights to the title. \n\n\nEorzea out of sight\n\n\nPlans for the live-action Final Fantasy XIV were first revealed back in 2019, and had Square Enix teaming up with Sony Pictures Television and Hivemind. The initial announcement promised a new story set in Eorzea along with series mainstays like Chocobos, airships, and even the \"live-action debut of Cid.\" \n\n\nHivemind previously worked with Netflix on The Witcher and with Amazon on The Expanse, so the experience and potential was there. For the time being, at least we'll always have Dad of Light. \n\nThe post Live-action Final Fantasy XIV series canceled due to ‘size and scale’  appeared first on Destructoid.",

Today, Sony gave us our answer. \n\n\nThe Complete Edition dropped for PlayStation 5 on October 6. It brought with it a slew of bonus content on top of the revered Burning Shores expansion. All of this will be included within the PC Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition, now slated to release on March 21.\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of the PC Complete Edition's content is similar to that of the PlayStation 5 version, But the PC port has some additional bells and whistles that will excite those with more heftier hardware. PC players will have the option to unlock frame rates, personalize their graphics settings, and enjoy advanced performance features like NVIDIA's DLSS 3 upscaling and frame generation.\n\n\nAs for monitors, ultra-wide support has been implemented so that PC players can enjoy all of Forbidden West's incredible environments. You'll have the ability to go as far as a triple monitor setup, with resolution options including 21:9, 32:9, and 48:9.\n\n\nMouse and keyboard controls are fully customizable, of course. Steam Input support is implemented so that you can remap your controller of choice. Including the PlayStation DualSense which allows PC players to enjoy Guerilla Games' use of the controller's haptic feedback abilities. \n\n\nAs for the Complete Edition's bonus content, there are a handful of new outfits and weapons that will be available for download. Also included are a resource pack, an Apex Clawstrider Machine Strike Piece, and an exclusive Photo Mode pose and face paint that's only in the Complete Edition. You can get the full breakdown over on the PlayStation Blog.\n\n\nPC players can begin playing the Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition on March 21. If you've yet to check out Forbidden West, you should. It's pretty great. \n\nThe post Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition ventures onto PC in March appeared first on Destructoid.",

It also is undeniably important to what would eventually become Assassin's Creed.\nJoin superfan Kyle Hilliard and Prince of Persia newcomer Wesley LeBlanc for a look at the 2003 classic.

We intend to investigate and take appropriate measures to address any acts that infringe on intellectual property rights related to the Pokémon.”\nWhile The Pokémon Company doesn’t explicitly name Palworld or its developer, Pocketpair, in its statement, we presume it’s investigating the record-setting Steam title based on the specified release window and recent controversies surrounding the game’s alleged infringement of Pokémon IP. \n“We will continue to cherish and nurture each and every Pokémon and its world, and work to bring the world together through Pokémon in the future,” the company states in closing. \nNeed to get up to speed on Palworld’s meteoric launch or its subsequent controversies?

While the game will continue to receive support until then, its final story campaign will serve as its last big hurrah. \nReincarnation first launched on July 28, 2021 for iOS and Android and takes place within an unspecified point in the Nier timeline. Like the previous titles, Reincarnation is an RPG set within a mysterious prison world called The Cage, with players controlling different protagonists divided across multiple story arcs. The game has also hosted several crossover events with games such as the remake of Nier Replicant, Final Fantasy XIV, and Persona 5.\nThe shutdown news came the same day as the launch of the latest chapter of its final story arc, The People And The World, dubbed Act II: The Return. Check out the trailer below.\n\n\nIn a shutdown notice, Square Enix states, \nUntil service concludes, Square Enix will offer 10 free summons per day, weekly gem gifts, and other perks. Sales of items on the Premium Shop have ceased. You can read the full rollout of final updates and events in Square Enix's blog post. \nFormer editor Jason Guisao was impressed with Nier Reincarnation, hailing it in an opinion piece as one of the strongest mobile titles available, writing that \"Lengthy narratives and skill-based gameplay loops have come in console/PC-ports like Genshin Impact and PUBG Mobile. Nier Reincarnation, however, employs a happy medium. Heartfelt plotlines with striking visuals, Keiichi Okabe’s mesmerizing score, unintrusive microtransactions, and simple, but rewarding, combat controls establish Reincarnation as one of the best console-like games on mobile devices.\"",

Now, just a few months later, Nintendo has revealed exactly when: February 22, 2024. That's when Wave 2 of the Splatoon 3 expansion pass, which features Side Order as the star of the show, goes live, and it's when players can explore the Spire of Order, a brand new location. \nNintendo announced this news with a short teaser trailer today that shows Agent 8 sleeping on a train. The teaser then transitions to the Spire of Order where a mysterious voice is calling out to Agent 8. \nCheck it out for yourself below in the Splatoon 3 Side Order DLC release date trailer: \n\n\nFor the uninitiated, Agent 8 is the protagonist from Splatoon 2's Octo Expansion. In Side Order, Agent 8 will meet a new character named Acht, who claims to go \"way back\" with Marina, one of the hosts of Splatoon 2. Marina's co-host, Pearl, seems to make an appearance of sorts in Side Order as a robot that accompanies Agent 8 on their journey. \nWith the Spire of Order devoid of color, Acht gives Agent 8 color chips to modify their abilities, like boosting run speed and increasing damage. It's likely Agent 8's colored ink will be used to bring color back to the spire, too, but we'll have to wait until February 22 to find out. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's Splatoon 3 review, and then check out what else is in the Splatoon 3 expansion pass. \nAre you going to check out Side Order next month?

You can capture Pokémon-like monsters called Pals in special balls (and you can capture humans, too), but it's smart to shoot them or hack at them with an axe first to lower their health. And then, once under your command, you can give them their own guns to use, of course. \nFollowing various trailers since that 2021 reveal, including this gameplay showcase and this one highlighting the different Pals you can find, we learned at Geoff Keighely's Summer Game Fest last year that Palworld would finally…",

          "description": "Street Fighter 6 is getting its third DLC fighter in February, and the psycho-powered boxer Ed is next in line. \nAlthough Ed was first introduced in Street Fighter IV, he didn’t become a playable fighter until Street Fighter V (included in the Season 2 roster of characters). The protege of Balrog sports the same psycho powers that M. Bison wielded, but he thankfully isn’t an evil mastermind. That doesn't make him any less brutal, though, and you can watch him clear a subway car full of Mad Gear gang members in the cinematic trailer below. \n\n\nEd joins Street Fighter 6 as the third fighter in the Year 1 character pass alongside the previously released Rashid and A.K.I. (leaving Akuma as the final Year 1 fighter) and will appear in the story-driven World Tour mode too.

It’s a genre that has been gaining traction in recent years, but Ubisoft’s return to the Prince of Persia franchise is one of the best we’ve seen in a long time. It's even managed to make a spot for itself on our list of the Best Metroidvania Games you should make a point to play. \nThe Lost Crown is also notable for the way it advances this game style with novel ideas and mechanics.

What was once a criminally underused design template has become one of the most commonly used formats in games. That’s especially true for indie developers, who seem more than happy to make up for prolonged droughts between actual Metroid and Castlevania titles by concocting their own unique spins on the style. While some 3D games have adopted the formula to success (see: Batman: Arkham Asylum), this list will only highlight 2D-style titles for the sake of clarity.

Square Enix also revealed Visions of Mana will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC this summer.\nExecutive producer Masaru Oyamada discussed the franchise's history, noting there have been 17 entries across its 30 years of existence. He also points out that what is now the Mana series today actually began as Final Fantasy Adventure in 1991. \n\n\nMana series creator Koichi Ishii also joined this segment of the show to discuss how he has supervised the team on its work and implementation of taking what were originally pixelated monsters and converting them into the 3D monsters players will fight in the game. \nNotably, Visions of Mana is the first Mana game coming to Xbox. Oyamada expressed Square Enix's excitement about this first for the series while diving deeper into its real-time action combat. This real-time action combat is what originally separated Final Fantasy Adventure from the Final Fantasy series, which was strictly turn-based at the time. \nVisions of Mana's combat continues to look great, as does its beautifully vibrant world. Unfortunately, there's still a few months to go until PlayStation, Xbox, and PC players can play it because it's due out sometime this summer. \n\nWhile waiting for its release, check out the Visions of Mana announcement trailer from The Game Awards 2023 last month. \nAre you excited for Visions of Mana?

          "description": "Developer Ninja Theory appeared on Microsoft's Xbox Developer Direct stream to discuss its sequel, Senua's Saga: Hellblade II. The big news from the footage is the game finally has a release date: May 21. Microsoft also confirmed that the game will be a digital-only release.\nThe developer revealed it is in the final months of development and outlined some elements to expect from Hellblade II. Senua is not in as much fear of her voices as she was in the original game, but she is still a Celtic warrior who struggles with psychosis. Like the first game, Ninja Theory is working with professionals like Cambridge's Paul Fletcher to ensure Senua represents an accurate version of someone struggling with complex mental issues.\n\n\nThere are a number of new characters she will interact with. Some will appreciate her perspective and consider her an ally, but others will reject her and consider her an enemy. Like the original game, Hellblade II takes 10th century Iceland (which the developer visited for research), and she is fighting against Vikings who are enslaving her people. Ninja Theory is focused on making the game historically accurate but with an obvious layer of fantasy on top.\nCombat has been overhauled for the sequel, with the game focusing on the fact that Senua is not a superhero. The goal of the combat is to make players feel like they barely survived each encounter, and the gameplay footage of the combat looks brutal.\nNinja Theory ended the stream saying it hopes to \"craft life-changing art with game-changing tech.\" We will determine if the game lives up to that lofty goal on May 21.",
