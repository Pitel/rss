          "description": "\"We were working on getting the rights to this game for several years\".\n2002's The Thing is widely regarded as one of the best horror games based on an existing media franchise. Many licensed horror games are sadly relegated to genres that require a specific setup, such as asymmetrical multiplayer or short VR experiences, but The Thing — a third-person squad-based shooter — dared to go one step further, telling its own unique story that serves as a proper sequel to John Carpenter's 1982 movie masterpiece.\nIt's not a game that frequents mainstream remaster wishlists, but Nightdive Studios is nevertheless delivering what few of us realised we wanted with The Thing: Remastered. Announced during IGN Live and scheduled to land on the Switch later this year, Computer Artworks' original is getting the full revamp treatment, with updated visuals, improved lighting, numerous quality-of-life tweaks, and more.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

For one individual, however, carrying a replica Master Sword around in real life has led to a rather unfortunate jail sentence.\nAs covered by Eurogamer, a man named Anthony Bray from Nuneaton, England, was caught with a six-inch replica of the Master Sword while wandering about in public. According to Bray, it was intended to be used as a fidget toy, however, arresting officers stated that it \"was in fact a sharply pointed item which could be used as a weapon and might put others in fear of it being used against them\".\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

So, please, if you trust our opinions, trust this one: Tchia is incredible.\nHere's what we knew about Tchia before we went into it: it had been touted as one of those nebulously-defined \"cosy games\", and it involved sailing. That much you could divine from its key art alone, with a girl on a raft sailing through crisp, blue waters towards sparkling white sands. It was only an hour or two into the game before we started to understand that Tchia is much, much more than that.

          "description": "Blood-meltingly beautiful.\nTsukihime is responsible for a lot of things. Back in 2000, Type-Moon’s classic visual novel captivated audiences with a story crammed full of occult mystery, thrilling action, and heart-pounding character drama. Like jagged lines splintering out of a unified core, its success spread out in many different directions: adaptations across manga and anime, the production of a number of sequel VNs, the birth of Type-Moon’s mega-popular Fate franchise, and, of course, the creation of its very own fighting game series Melty Blood. It’s no stretch to say that Tsukihime is a cornerstone of the industry, which is exactly why the title’s fade into relative obscurity is such a surprise.\nFor all the waves it made in the time during and after its release, Tsukihime has never been graced with an official Western localization. Moreover, the original Japanese release has long since become abandonware, with the task of preserving the game online falling to diehard fans. Suffice to say, it’s not the fate that a game many champion as one of the best in its genre deserves. Fortunately, Type-Moon has seen fit to rectify that problem by way of a full-on remake project.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Despite the passage of time, there's a stratum of untouchables that still feel as vital in the hands as the day they were released. Personal preferences and nostalgia will always, always come into play, but games like Super Mario Bros. 3 or Super Mario World? It's hard to imagine them feeling any better if they launched yesterday.\nCritical consensus puts classics like those on a pedestal which seems precarious — they can't be that good, right? — but whenever you return, they do, somehow, stand up.

I have a lot of material, oodles of interviews with developers of all shapes and sizes - big shops like Remedy and CD Projekt, smaller studios like Ace Team and Awaceb, all holding forth on such topics as whether Elden Ring or Zelda did bandit camps better, and how you make a forest feel endless. There is so much you could talk about, so many trails heading off in all directions, but perhaps it's best to begin with the more personal and superficial question that inspired this investigation: how did the open world game get so boring? \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "You may or may not have seen Black Myth: Wukong impressions floating around as of late. Some claim it's not a Soulslike, or is merely Soulslike-adjacent. Some say it's a \"boss rush\" with a world that lets it down. Having spent 90 minutes with it myself, I'd like to add my ferocious take to the pile: you play monke = is good. But no seriously, I think no matter if it's a bit Soulsy or not, my key takeaway is one of relief. There's a lot more substance to back up the style than I thought there would be, alongside it feeling a lot more compact than the behemoth I envisioned in my head. All good signs for the complete package, which strikes me as living up to the crushing pressure of its number one Steam Wishlist spot.\nRead more",

          "description": "Besides giving The First Descendant the ol’ benchy marks on desktop, I was curious to see how this gleaming looter shooter would run on the less flexing hardware of the Steam Deck. The answer: it didn’t, at first. Luckily, a semi-quick fix was enough to get me in, where I found a game that for all its ray tracing inclinations, is comfortable with life on the Deck. Reasonably. Most of the time.\nWith any luck, my issue could be purged completely by the time The First Descendant releases on July 2nd. Partly because I was using a technically non-final preview build, and partly because the problem itself was a silly one: launching was blocked by a case of missing Visual C++, something that the Steam Deck’s Proton compatibility witchcraft usually takes care of. Come on, Proton lad, you’re kinda dropping the ball here.\nIf this ever happens to you, in The First Descendant or any other game, I heartily recommend YouTuber JD Ros’ video tutorial on fixing it. The method boils down to installing the latest C++ versions via the Steam Deck’s Desktop Mode, then adding their executables to the game’s launch options. This worked a treat for me, and I didn’t suffer any further compatibility headaches from there on out.\n Read more",

          "description": "Atari 50 was already a fairly comprehensive offering of retro games spanning half a century, launching in late 2022 as a playable museum of sorts charting the classic publisher’s output across arcade machines, the 2600, 5200, 7800 and Jaguar home consoles, 8-bit computers and the Lynx handheld. The more than 100 games included at launch was far from stingy, with an extra dozen being added in a free update at the end of last year. Now the collection will add almost 40 more games in an upcoming ‘Expanded Edition’, taking its total game count to over 150.\nRead more",

The Ancient Greek gods were outraged both by the king's violation of the norms of hospitality, and by his general insistence on being too clever by half - and I feel a similar way reading the Xitter feed of Bashir \"ManliestDev\" Kashalo, who is making a game in which you play as Sisyphus after his eventual demotion to Hell's chief stone-shover. \r\n \nRead more",

It’s also, wholeheartedly and unapologetically, a big graphical show-off, complete with multiple ray tracing modes and shinier power armour than if you fed the entire cast of Warframe through an industrial car wash.\nHappily, this doesn’t necessarily translate into chugging performance on low-end PCs, or even handhelds like the Steam Deck.

There's no ocean of online interactions, corroding the everyday from all directions, just 1-to-1s through boxy, retro-futurist screens that are so dingy and inadequate it feels like Ripley and Burke are peering at each other through a letterbox. Small wonder, given that Aliens was released in 1986, when what would become the internet was still mostly the province of universities and the military. \r\n \nRead more",

As Nic wrote earlier in the week, a portion of the negative feedback is aimed at the expansion's difficulty, which is certainly a Thing To Hear after years of being told by kindly gamers that I only hand out low review scores because I can't press the buttons in the right order.\nAs publishers Bandai Namco have sweetly observed, struggling players are perhaps forgetting that you can raise your overall power level by gathering Scadutree Fragments, a system of collectibles designed to ensure a tough challenge even for endgame players, while giving you the option of effectively rebalancing the expansion through exploration. The downside there, as a few people have pointed out, is that some players don't want to hunt for collectibles before they can topple the bosses.\n Read more",

The Elden Ring DLC is currently metacritic’s highest rated expansion of all time at 95, beating out the The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s Blood And Wine’s 92. However, roughly a third of the 41,000 user reviews on Steam are negative.\n \nRead more",

You get a mount simply for finishing the MSQ, and there’s also a miniature minion version up for grabs if you know where to look. \n\n\nHowever, in order to get the Alpaca Cria minion, you’re going to have to put in the effort when it comes to Shared FATEs. In this case, you’ll need to complete a set number of FATEs within Urqopacha before you can unlock the Alpaca Cria minion. \n\n\nHow to get the Alpaca Cria minion in Final Fantasy XIV\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nIn order to get this little bundle of fluffy joy, you’ll need to complete at least 66 FATEs in Urqopacha. While this may seem like a lot of FATEs, the number needed to complete Rank 3 of Shared FATEs has been reduced compared to both Shadowbringers and Endwalker, so the grind isn’t as bad as it used to be. \n\n\nOnce you’ve done this, you should have stocked up a fair amount of Bi-color Gemstones, considering you earn a minimum of 16 per FATE completed with a Silver or higher rating. With these in your back pocket, head straight to Wachunpelo. \n\n\nYou’ll find the local Gemstone Trader at (X:27.5, Y:11.7), directly next to the main entrance to the settlement. \n\n\nAs long as you’ve reached Rank 3 in the area, you’ll be able to purchase the Alpaca Cria minion for 700 Bi-color Gemstones. Achieving Rank 3 also unlocks the Windswept Echoes Orchestrion Roll for 450 Bi-color Gemstones.\n\nThe post How to get Alpaca Cria minion in FFXIV Dawntrail appeared first on Destructoid.",

That isn't to say they're bad by any means, but they aren't weapons you should be gunning for and adding to your main arsenal. That isn't to say all the raid weapons are like this, however, including an incredible bow given the right perks. Here's the god roll for the Non-Denouement bow in Destiny 2.\n\n\nThe best perks and attachments for the Non-Denouement bow in Destiny 2\n\n\nImage via Destructoid.\n\n\nThe Non-Denouement can be acquired from the first, second, or fourth encounters of the Salvation's Edge raid, available as a drop from the final chest. It sports some decent base stats, but nothing that would make it seem extraordinary. It also has the Precision Frame, granting you additional damage on charged shots. However, the bow can get two perks that transform it from a decent bow to a legendary Trinity Ghoul. If you want this for yourself, here are the perks and attachments you'll need:\n\n\n\nBowstring: Flexible String\n\n\nArrow: Compact Arrow Shaft\n\n\nPerk 1: Dragonfly\n\n\nPerk 2: Voltshot\n\n\n\nThere isn't too much to talk about with the Bowstring and Arrow, merely serving to provide some additional reload speed and draw time. It's the perk choices of Dragonfly and Voltshot that matter. Dragonfly is consistently a good perk on weapons, and having an elemental damage explosion off its innate Arc damage is massive damage on its own. Voltshot meanwhile provides chain lightning after killing a target, which is in essence just Trinity Ghoul's perk. These combined make it an ad clear machine, and open up the opportunity for another exotic weapon such as the Gjallahorn or the Still Hunt.\n\nThe post Destiny 2 Non-Denouement god roll – Best perks and attachments appeared first on Destructoid.",

There's a lot to do in the game between completing quests, taking on Void Intercept Battles, and exploring the map. To do that, however, you need to get into the game first. Error codes tend to impede that a bit. Here's how to fix the LE:13 error in The First Descendant.\n\n\nThe First Descendant LE:13 error fixes\n\n\nImage via Destructoid.\n\n\nThe LE:13 error appears when first loading up the game, listed as \"Game login failed. [LE:13]\". This error implies an issue connecting to The First Descendant servers, meaning there's a network issue either on your end or on Nexon's servers. The first thing you should try is restarting your game, as some players have reported this immediately working. If that doesn't work, then you should try restarting your device and your router as either could be having issues in general. You can also test another online game if you have one installed since those should be working fine if your connection is fine.\n\n\nIf you do all that and it still isn't working, then it's likely an error on Nexon's end. The game was only just released a few days ago, so the servers haven't been put under much stress to test their effectiveness. This is fairly normal for any online game and merely requires some patience on your end. If you want to be sure it's not you, you can always check The First Descendant's social media pages to see if anything has been noted regarding downtime. As one example, a lot of people are reporting login issues as we're publishing this article. The chances of this being on everyone else's end are infinitely slim.\n\nThe post How to fix the LE:13 error in The First Descendant appeared first on Destructoid.",

All things considered, she's definitely worth completing if you want a cheap but reliable starter in your team. \n\nThe post EA FC 24: How to complete Ebby Arceg Flashback SBC appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Sims 4's Lovestruck expansion pack is about spreading love in every way you can imagine. One of the expansion's main features is the Cupid's Corner dating app, allowing you to find potential love interests with just a few button presses and screen swipes. However, this app isn't limited to just NPCs; you can match with other players' characters.\n\n\nAccording to posts on official Sims 4 social media pages like X (Twitter) and Discord, players can upload their Sims to the game's gallery with the #LovestruckSingles hashtag. By doing this, your character can appear in the app for others to judge.\n\n\n\n\nWhile this is a great opportunity to find some adorably romantic interactions with someone you like, this can also create some peculiar situations, depending on how strict its moderation is. Although the post mentions eligible Sims will populate the app, we'll certainly see plenty of creativity in these creations. There's also no immediate mention of how many characters you can add, but there's a chance EA and Maxis will implement some limits here and there.\n\n\nThe idea of adding your own Sim to The Sims 4's gallery and having them appear in Lovestruck's app makes for some pleasantly surprising realism with how it works, especially considering the expansion is all about improving the game's social interactions. Though indirect, expanding upon this by encouraging player-to-player relationships can make for a completely new dynamic with how you play. Only time will tell how well this holds up in practice, though.\n\n\n The Sims 4's Lovestruck expansion pack, including the Cupid's Corner dating app, will fully release on July 25, 2024.\n\nThe post You can add your own Sims 4 characters to Lovestruck’s dating app appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The hub world of Albion in The First Descendant is an important place to visit frequently. Outside of needing to progress the main story here, it's a place to sell gear, store items in a storage box, and start Void Intercept Battles. One vendor is quite useful when it comes to the central grind of the game but can be hard to locate. Here's how to find Anais in The First Descendant.\n\n\nHow to find Anais in The First Descendant\n\n\nImage via Destructoid.\n\n\nTo find Anais, you want to head to where you spawn then run to the right. Pass by the stairs down to Alpha, then head down the later stairs toward Deslin, the weapons vendor. You should see a small circular room nearby which you want to enter. It's located somewhat between the Module upgrade vendor and Deslin. Alternatively, you can use the above map to locate Anais.\n\n\nImage via Destructoid.\n\n\nOnce at Anais, speak with her to view her various research options. You can research new Descendants, Weapons, and other pieces of gear using Gold and numerous resources. It'll take quite some time and grinding to acquire these, though you can purchase them with real money if you wish. Once you have the various parts and cash to purchase something, start constructing it and wait a short time. After that time is up, the Descendant or piece of gear will be yours to select whenever you wish.\n\n\nWhere can you get parts for Descendants and gear?\n\n\nIf you want to go the grinding route, there are a few places you can look. Void Intercept Battles are a great source of gear for Descendants like Gley, whereas anything else can be earned from farming activities in any of the game's regions. This is on a case-by-case basis, so you'll need to examine whatever activity you want to farm to know what it drops.\n\nThe post Where to find Anais in The First Descendant appeared first on Destructoid.",

Owners of these games will still be able to play their single-player content, but online support for these titles will end on November 7. The embedded announcement post on X also includes a link to an FAQ to answer additional questions about the sunsetting process. \nhttps://t.co/2W8dLlGjBM\nJune 28, 2024\nWhile the digital PS3/Xbox 360 versions of these games are going away, Battlefield 3 will still be available to purchase on PC. The same is true for Battlefield 4 and Hardline, and these two titles will also remain on sale for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The PC/PS4/Xbox One versions will remain unaffected by today’s updates.\nIt never feels good to see games get removed from sale like this. The reason likely has to do with EA sunsetting online support; it wouldn't be right to continue selling games with popular online modes if that component doesn't work anymore. For those still logging into Battlefield matches on PS3 and 360, you've got a few more months to enjoy the ride.\nFor more on Battlefield, you can learn about how the next entry is shaping up (which is being made with help by Dead Space remake developer Motive Studios) here.",

And it continues to look like a scary new addition to the A Quiet Place movie universe. \nThough there's still no release date – it's launching sometime this year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC – this story trailer reveals more about the state of the world in The Road Ahead. It seemingly begins on Day One, when the aliens, which possess incredible hearing that requires people to remain silent to survive, attack Earth. It then jumps ahead to Day 105, with Alex, an asthmatic college student trying to survive the end of the world with her boyfriend Martin, on the hunt for supplies and more. \nCheck it out for yourself in the story trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead below: \n\n\nAs you can see, it seems Alex might be pregnant, which, if you've seen the first A Quiet Place movie, can make trying to remain silent in this world quite difficult. We'll have to wait a little longer to find out how the story of A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead plays out because it launches later this year on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. \nFor more about the game, watch the reveal trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead. \nAre you excited for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead?

As for why, the team wants to give its spiritual cousin, Life Is Strange: Double Exposure, some space to shine later this year. \nLost Records was originally due out in late 2024, which is also when the next Life is Strange is set to launch. Instead of competing with Life Is Strange, a series that Don't Nod created with the first Life Is Strange and continued with Life Is Strange 2 before Double Exposure developer Deck Nine took over with 2017's Before the Storm and 2021's True Colors, the studio decided to push to 2025. \nWe've made the decision to move the release dates of Lost Records: Bloom & Rage to early 2025. We know you're all excited for both Lost Records and the new Life is Strange game, and we wanted to ensure both have adequate space to shine. The wait will be worth it! pic.twitter.com/PH1O7z3uUy\nJune 28, 2024\nLife Is Strange: Double Exposure launches October 29, and now, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, which will be released in two parts, will launch sometime early next year. Both games are set to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. \nIn the meantime, watch the reveal trailer for Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, and then watch the Life Is Strange: Double Exposure reveal trailer.

Despite my expectations, I was not prepared for how robust it actually is in Veilguard. Robust enough, even, that BioWare used it to create most of the NPCs in the game, save for mainline characters like companions. Setting hyperbole aside, it is a staggeringly rich creation system, and I look forward to seeing player-created near-replicas of celebrities and monstrous creations that'd be more at home in a horror game. \nBut I'm also looking forward to the community's reaction to the Dragon Age series' best character creator yet.

Originally slated to launch next month on July 25, the upcoming narrative-driven city-builder is now arriving on September 20.\nDeveloper 11 Bit Studios sates that following a recent beta, the team wants to take extra time addressing feedback to ensure the best possible experience. In a press release, design director Jakub Stokalski and art director Lukasz Juszczyk issued the following statement:\n“Based on the surveys we received after playing Beta, the average rating you gave us was 8 out of 10. We’re super grateful for that! At the same time, it was only a small slice of a work-in-progress, still-growing game. While our backlog is plentiful, it was an opportunity for us to listen to what you enjoyed, and what didn’t quite land yet”. \n“This allowed us to prioritise things better, and bring upfront the features and modifications we were already working on. But we also realised that to guarantee the best possible experience on launch, we need more time to finish the development of Frostpunk 2. That’s why we made the difficult decision to postpone its release to September 20th, 2024”.\n11 Bit States that it plans to work on new additions to existing game mechanics and improve the UI and UX, among other things. \nFrostpunk 2 will launch first for PC on September 20.

More specifically, it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam) on August 1, and it brings with it updated visuals and controls and a new skin that harkens back to the original game's most infamous easter egg. \nIn the reveal trailer, we get a look at the graphical improvements Aspyr has implemented in Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, but the game still retains that 2002 PlayStation 2 and GameCube charm. This re-release follows a limited PlayStation 4 physical run that launched back in 2019. \nCheck out the Star Wars: Bounty Hunter announcement trailer below: \n\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, you play as Jango Fett throughout the story, which itself is a prequel to Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. \nIn the original game, there was an easter egg message that said, \"Cash in all bounties to play as Boba.\" However, cashing in all bounties did not let you play as Boba. To make good on that original promise from 2002, Aspyr media has included a Boba Fett skin in Star Wars: Bounty Hunters you can use after completing the game's campaign. \nStar Wars: Bounty Hunter hits PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on August 1. \nWhile waiting for its launch, check out this lengthy gameplay demo of Star Wars Outlaws, another mercenary-centric Star Wars game launching this year.

Though the once previously Xbox-exclusive game has since made its way to PlayStation and PC platforms, it remains unclear which platforms this remaster is coming to. And there's no word on when to expect the remaster either. \nRevealed with a short 47-second teaser trailer, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster looks great, almost more like a remake than a remaster. It's unclear if this is a remaster of the original 2006 game or the HD version of Dead Rising that launched on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC back in 2017.

          "description": "The one and only Elden Ring expansion we're getting, Shadow of the Erdtree, launched last week and thousands of Tarnished went to the shadow realm to take on dozens of new enemies, bosses, and more. Now, just a few days later, developer From Software has released a new patch for the game that should make Shadow of the Erdtree a bit easier. \nNow live, Calibration Update 1.12.2 targets the scaling of the attack and damage negation given to players with each Shadow Realm Blessing upgrade. Here's what's changed: \nThe attack and damage negation has been increased for the first half of the maximum amount of Blessing enhancements, and the second half will now be more gradual. \nThe attack and damage negation granted by the final level of Blessing enhancements has been slightly increased. \n\n\nThis patch should apply automatically like any other Elden Ring update but if it doesn't – the Calibration Version listed at the bottom right reads \"1.12.2\" if it has – select \"LOGIN\" and that will apply the latest version of the game. \nThe only other thing this update contains is word from From Software on a confirmed bug where the raytracing settings of Shadow of the Erdtree are automatically enabled (if you've previously loaded save data from previous game versions), which is causing framerate issues for some players. If you're encountering said issues, check to see if you have raytracing on or off in the game's system graphical settings. \nThis patch arrives after one that hit the game last week, which added new hairtsyles, inventory features, balance adjustments, and more to Elden Ring ahead of Shadow of the Erdtree's launch. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review, and then check out this interview where From Software's Hidetaka Miyazaki discusses his approach to difficulty in games. \nWhat do you think of this update?

As the names suggest, each features a unique combat system and plays differently as a result.

However, a through-line is apparent from Origins to Inquisition: BioWare seemingly wants this franchise to be action but has attempted to shift to that without abandoning its longtime fans. \nWith Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has completed its transition from strategy to real-time action, but thanks to an optional tactical pause-and-play combat wheel that harkens back to the series' origins, I feel it's found a great (battle)ground …",

No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.\nThis is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.\nIf you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.\nNow, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)\n>",
