In addition to installing the SUPER5 OLED screen to the new Zelda Switch Lite console, he has also replaced the standard analogue sticks with hall effect joysticks alongside an upgraded 5,000 mAh battery. The result is essentially the 'ultimate' Switch Lite for use at home and on the go, and it's absolutely stunning.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

That’s mainly down the multiplayer Operations mode. It isn’t quite as deep as Darktide, but it feels like much less work, and I’m starting to realise just how phenomenal the little details in the animation and sound are. Saber seem to agree they’ve got a winner on their hands, too. As per yesterday’s community update, they’re not wasting any time spilling the details on the game’s next co-op mission.\nRead more",

It's a wildly camp musical and B-movie homage for stage and screen, in which two homely, heteronormative Americans seek shelter in a castle run by Tim Curry's high-kicking mad scientist Dr Frank-N-Furter. I can't speak for how well it has aged, but it was a hit work of sexual counterculture in the 1970s, and is absolutely Curry's finest hour outside of Command And Conquer. \r\n \nRead more",

A new report by Insider Gaming’s Tom Henderson has shed a little more light on the situation after talking to several developers on the project, who say they’ve been pushing for a delay \"for some time\", only for higher-ups at Ubi to just now take heed.\nRead more",

          "description": "Wild-eyed stickman brawler Judero appears to have kicked off a small wave of pagan-themed games - or rather, it has recalibrated my brain to be more aware of pagan-themed games. The latest to catch my fancy is party-based RPG Banquet For Fools, out in Early Access today with a demo. Created by two-person Hannah and Joseph Games, it casts you as one of the Vollings - a race of gaunt elven humanoids, hailing from the same school of manky action-figure as Judero, who have been shunned by their gods and have accordingly turned to paganism. \r\n\n\r\nSpecifically, you're a lord who has set up a spice farm on a \"cursed\" island, the former home of a long-dead civilization. This certainly sounds like a foolish thing to do, and it's no huge surprise that everybody on your farm has gone missing. So off you trot with a team of four custom-generated companions to solve the mystery, and also make up gnarly spells by daubing your blood on trees.\r\n \nRead more",

This must be how Guardiola feels, popping onto the pitch to celebrate his annual Prem title with the latest batch of ruthlessly efficient, lab-grown wonderkids and pushing down the feeling that this one doesn’t feel quite as special as the first.\nThat is to say, EA Sports FC25 is a bit like FC24. Which was quite a lot like FIFAs 21-23, which had a lot in common with the FIFAs our ancient ancestors used to play by the fireside in their primitive tribal dwellings. There are noticeable additions - particularly new tactics controls and a 5v5 Rush mode - and I’m glad they’re here. But as much as they contribute towards a continuously compelling suite of foot-to-ball, they can’t quite dislodge the nagging feeling that this shouldn’t be an annual, full-price release anymore.\nRead more",

The maximum cabaret? Madness! Delightful madness! Here's the trailer for Clowned King, the next game from Moonana, developer of the colourful and melodious Keylocker. I like it better than a custard pie full of razorblades. I like most things better than a custard pie full of razorblades, but this comes reasonably high up that list.\n Read more",

Take 12 blanks, doodle some faces and landscapes, and lo, you have a procedural narrative generator. Make some duplicates, invent a few rules and lo, you have systems. \r\n\n\r\nConversely, the great drawback of cards - especially in those roguelite deckbuilders people have been churning out since Slay The Spire - is that everything can be reduced to them. For example: last night, I played a round of Fungi with my partner, Fungi being a charming tabletop foraging sim in which you gather scrumptious chantarelles and boletus from the forest floor. This morning I resumed playing Breachway, out now in early access, in which you guide a starship through a series of wartorn solar systems, with battles unfolding as a turn-based exchange of cards corresponding to ship components. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Here’s the thing about the trowel: it’s a pretty good trowel. Nothing fancy. But recently, I keep digging up… objects. Objects most peculiar. I’ve got the weekend to sort this garden, and a cosy little shed to sleep in, so I really should just get on with it. Again, though, I must reiterate: I keep digging up… objects.\nI go to clean some rubbish from the bathroom. I interact with the mirror and the game says: “You do not see anything in the mirror”. I take a note that says: I do not see anything in the mirror. I check the game again and no, I still do not see anything in the mirror. Sure it’s fine. Just a shit mirror, probably.

          "description": "Indie developers love making retro-styled games that look like PlayStation games you rented from Blockbuster and blitzed through in a feverish winter weekend. I'm glad, so here's another. Cold And Afraid is a murder mystery that aims to channel the 1990s with chunky characters and lots of lovely dithering. You play a detective out to stop a serial killer with a grisly pattern who's preying on the young women of an unnamed US city. On top of the obligatory tank controls, it aims to have \"consequential dialogue choices\" and a \"Time Event system where you must meet certain people at specific times to forward different story threads\". Ah, forgive me, you're here to see the chunky limbs. Here's a recent trailer that shows 'em.\nRead more",

This is the same Behaviour Interactive who recently laid off a bunch of people, cancelled a game and closed a studio, Midwinter Entertainment, after bagging themselves a bunch of developers (the others are SockMonkey, Codeglue and Fly Studio) over the past two years. Darkest Dungeon is a horror game like DBD, so I guess the acquisition chimes from that perspective. All the same, my snap judgement is \"yikes\".\r\n\n \nRead more",

They have just released GreedFall 2: The Dying Land into early access. For those who don't remember the first GreedFall, it was a colonial-styled RPG about landing on the magical shores of another continent and getting into scrapes with monsters and frontiersfolk. This time the story is furthering the fantasy Columbian exchange by putting you in the role of a native who's been uprooted against their will and taken to the \"old world\". The game's release comes against a backdrop of dissatisfaction in the studio. But workers have gained some concessions in talks. \nRead more",

I'm talking about the one city block RPG that Warren Spector has often mentioned. Sure, we've seen a few usual suspects already - Deus Ex Mankind Divided, Disco Elysium, even Else: Heart.Break - they all grimace in the line-up but nothing ever sticks. Now, out of the gloom of indie development, comes another perp ready to have his mugshot taken. Shadows Of Doubt is an open world detective sim that comes perilously close to being our guy. Its clothes, stature, gait, and fingerprints match the description of what Spector often describes. And yet, if you tilt your head, something is just a little off. The game isn't confined to one block. It's not an RPG precisely. And its simulation has plenty of bugs, jank, and unintentional comedy. But after all this time, in the absence of a smoking gun, shouldn't we just put this guy in the slammer and call the case closed? I say yes, let's. Officers!

In the original you controlled the titular Mickey Mouse who, armed with a magical paintbrush (wieldable by waving the Wiimote about), could paint or rub out surfaces to solve puzzles. It was the work of Junction Studios led by Warren Spector, best known for being The Deus Ex Guy. No, sadly Mickey could not nano-augment his brush for better target acquisition, nor project laser-guided anti-tank rockets from his podgy white mitts.\nAnd no, Rebrushed doesn't let him do anything of these either. Clearly a missed opportunity. But is it better nonetheless? With an updated look, some added secrets, more moves for Mickey, and controller/M&K support, I'd say longtime Mickey heads will adore this nostalgia trip. For total newcomers like me, I'd say it's a platformer that's certainly charming and clever and wonderfully experimental, but a bit flat in places too.\nRead more",

A  new report from Rebekah Valentine at IGN has since shed some more light on the walkout, which reportedly involved “disagreements over the direction of the Interactive division, chaotic departures, communication breakdowns, and a perceived lack of leadership transparency.” It’s a thorough account of some messy events I recommend reading in full, but here’s a brief rundown.\nRead more",

You couldn’t injure yourself on those scythes if you tried. It’s polearm-ical correctness gone mad! Well, good news if you’re nostalgic for a simpler time, where tiny scythes could maim you for life, and binary digits came in lots of eight and not a binary digit more. RPG Beyond Shadowgate is a vastly-expanded, modernised sequel to the classic NES adventure, created by the original’s designers, and it just released last week.\nRead more",

          "description": "Popular World War II grand strategy title Hearts of Iron IV is getting its sixth expansion pack. Paradox Interactive revealed Götterdämmerung, the upcoming expansion that will revise the German focus tree to allow the most played faction to have even more choices of direction including taking Germany down a monarchist, a restored democratic, or even an alternate fascist path.\n\n\n\n\nIt certainly makes sense for Paradox to revamp Germany's Focus Tree in HOI4, as other countries have gotten bigger tree revisits in recent expansions, and Germany is the most-played country. Austria has also received a revised Focus Tree, allowing players to vie for freedom from German control as well as rebuilding the Habsburg Empire with surrounding countries.\n\n\nTwo countries are also receiving new Focus Trees for the first time, essentially making them new options to play as. The first one is Hungary, where players will have to use technology to overcome the manpower shortages in the country. Players who succeed can eventually reform the Austro-Hungarian Empire and create a powerful unified faction in doing so. The second country getting a focus tree is Belgium. As Belgium, players can resist or welcome German supremacy and then draw on the wealth of the Congo.\n\n\nAside from the new and revised Focus Trees, HOI4 is also getting some love with various systems. Special Projects will allow players to build scientific facilities and pursue advanced research by assigning scientists to them. A new Raid function allows you to attack specific targets with carefully planned strikes such as ports, industrial structures, research facilities, and more, hitting them with targeted bombing strikes, commando raids, and paratroop attacks.\n\n\nThe Hearts of Iron IV: Götterdämmerung expansion is set to release on November 14, 2024 for $24.99 on PC. This expansion is also part of the HOI4 Expansion Pass 1 as well.\n\nThe post Hearts of Iron IV getting new German themed expansion Gotterdammerung appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s been over a year since the demo, so almost everything could have changed.\n\n\n\n\nSniper Killer comes from the horror development duo behind Bloodwash and Night at the Gates of Hell and Puppet Combo’s Torture Star Video publishing label. It follows the same seedy lo-fi look and feel, so there’ll be plenty of gore (and maybe a few tits), but it’ll all be charmingly low-poly and smudgy. A demo is still available, so you can try it out, but, as I mentioned, I don’t know how much has changed since then. I’ve been seeing development footage for quite a while now, and it seems like a lot of work has been done.\n\n\nI’m excited. While I felt that Night at the Gates of Hell’s gratuitousness paled in comparison to the more grounded(ish) Bloodwash, both are pretty unique indie horror experiences. So, even if I’m not sure Sniper Killer will have the same thrills as Bloodwash, it’s at least going to be inventive. The fact that it seems like less of an action or slasher plot gets me curious enough.\n\n\nSniper Killer releases on PC on October 17, 2024.\n\nThe post Bloodwash dev’s crime horror Sniper Killer is out this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

While the update is already available across all platforms, the servers continue to be out of order. Thankfully, NCSoft has already informed players of a potential timeline regarding when you'll be able to play once again.\n\n\nWhen will the Throne and Liberty servers go live after Update 1.1.0?\n\n\nThe maintenance began as scheduled at 12:30 a.m. PT/3:30 a.m. ET/7:30 a.m. UTC. According to the official notice, it is expected to last approximately six hours. If we assume that NCSoft will stick with that timeline, you can jump into Throne and Liberty at 6:30 a.m. PT/9:30 a.m. ET/1:30 p.m. UTC.\n\n\n\n\nThere's a chance that the maintenance could be extended at short notice. We have seen that happening in the past with games like Lost Ark, so a delay can't be ruled out yet. If there are no such delays, you should be able to play the latest MMO in about four hours since this article went live. If there are any delays, we will update the new timeline in this article.\n\n\nThe latest update includes some major changes across all platforms, much of which are targeted towards making the game a lot more stable. If the changes work as intended, the UI should feel smoother, and some of the errors you might have encountered till now should be resolved.\n\n\nHowever, to test it out, we will have to wait at least a few more hours until NCSoft is done with its maintenance work.\n\nThe post Throne and Liberty Server Maintenance times for October 3, explained appeared first on Destructoid.",

You'll have to reach level 7 in order to make one (or join a guild).\n\n\nHow to join a guild in Throne and Liberty\n\n\nIf you don't want to create a guild, you can simply join one made by another player. As an alternative, you can also join a Party if you simply want to clear content, which is hard to do alone. Once you're level 7 or higher, go to the main menu.\n\n\n\nSelect the Guild function.\n\n\nYou can filter out your results using the available prerequisites.\n\n\nOnce you've found a guild, send a request to join.\n\n\nOnce your request is accepted, you'll be part of the guild.\n\n\n\nApart from joining guilds and parties, Throne and Liberty also has a matchmaking system for certain types of content.

The agreement will see PUBG: Battlegrounds developer, PUBG Studios, bring Palworld to mobile devices for the first time.\n\n\nTouted as \"Pokemon with guns\" by fans, Palworld was a surprise gargantuan success upon its Early Access launch earlier this year. Few, least of all Pocketpair, could have seen its eyewatering sales figures coming, as it stormed to the top of the charts on PC and Xbox consoles at the start of 2024.\n\n\nImage via Pocketpair\n\n\nPlayer counts have dropped in the months since, although a recent PlayStation 5 release has helped bring new fans into the fold. Nintendo and The Pokemon Company suing Pocketpair has also played a part in keeping Palworld in the news cycle of late.\n\n\nKrafton confirmed Palworld's upcoming mobile port in a statement on its website, with its subsidiary PUBG Studios moving forward on the project. The announcement gave no release window for Palworld on Android and iOS, although it did confirm it \"plans to faithfully reinterpret and implement the original’s main fun elements to fit the mobile environment.\" Whether this results in any significant gameplay changes remains to be seen.\n\nThe post PUBG developer is bringing Palworld to mobile appeared first on Destructoid.",
