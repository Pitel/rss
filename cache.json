The package itself comes with some NFC cards, a Joy-Con add-on device, and perhaps most interestingly, a bottle of hot sauce (not actual hot sauce, although the first publisher that includes some hot sauce with an upcoming game gets a thumbs up from us).

After Sonic saves Tails from an approaching vehicle, he recounts how the two originally met and became friends, after which Tails gives an alternate take on his \"origin\" story. Both versions of the tale showcase retro pixel art visuals similar to the original Sonic games, which - while lacking some of the platformers' character and charm - is a lovely little touch.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Each minute, a couple of million dollars of production glitz is poured into your flickering eyeballs, while you stuff your slack jaw with popcorn. Papetura is both exactly like that and nothing like that at all at the same time.\nProduced mainly by lone creative Thomas Ostafin, Papetura burst onto crowdfunding site Indiegogo in 2015, but it didn’t reach its funding target. However, after four more years of refusing to be discouraged, the game made it to Steam in 2019. If there’s a clearer example of a gaming passion project, we don’t know what it is. So, while the megabucks aren’t flying at your face as you play, every background in the game, every animation, every puzzle, and every scene is made of pure, highly concentrated graft.

          "description": "An ambitious title that just misses the mark.\nThe world wasn’t ready for Romancing SaGa when it was first released back in 1992. It wasn’t until the PS2 remake in 2005 that the title would make its way to western shores, where it quickly gained a passionate following among fans of its non-linear storytelling, expressive characters, and multiple-choice approach to protagonists. Playing through this remaster of the JRPG cult classic, dubbed Romancing SaGa – Minstrel Song – Remastered, reminds us of how special it is, despite some baffling design decisions.\nUnlike the 2005 remake, this is more of an upgrade on the Romancing SaGa experience rather than a complete overhaul. It comes with updated, shiny HD visuals and new playable characters, as well as a handful of quality-of-life changes to improve the experience for new players. But even as a remaster of a 20-year-old JRPG, Romancing SaGa – Minstrel Song – Remastered is an ambitious title that tries to do many things that even modern games struggle with.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Is it the inclusion of birds? Well, you might be forgiven for thinking it's the last one, because at least ten of the games on this list are about birds specifically, but the idea of a \"cozy\" game is a bit more nebulous than that.\nIt's more of a feeling, really: a game that you can relax to, that can be challenging but never punishing, with elements of friendship, community, and kindness. But not always — some \"cozy\" games (like a certain game about a bad goose) are more about letting the player go a little bit wild, but always in a way that's gentler and less severe than chopping people's heads off in a Dark Souls or a Witcher game.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

While perhaps not leaps and bounds ahead of the competition, nevertheless, they’re a striking cast of multicoloured, glassy-eyed femme fatales that glow from every angle.

But that’s not why you’re here, is it? Hell no, you’re in it for the pantsu, and that’s one area Samurai Maiden delivers in aplomb.\nBefore we get assaulted in the comments section for ragging on people who enjoy this kind of media, let it be known we actually like Samurai Maiden quite a lot. It may have all the staple hallmarks of the ecchi genre, including a plot that’s been written on the back of a train ticket, but as a game, it does very well.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

And let me tell you, the lead-up to a night like The Game Awards is always something else. Fringes of the Tomb Raider fanbase were getting hyped for the announcement of the next game because… well, it just feels like about time, right? The same went for Life Is Strange, but then, Life Is Strange fans have been predicting the imminent reveal of LIS3 literally on a weekly basis ever since True Colors launched, so they're bound to be right eventually. Ace Attorney stans were using numerology to predict that AA7 would finally get announced. Incredible scenes of completely baseless hype, and despite myself, I wanted to believe.\nI genuinely daren't check in on any of those conversations today, because, honestly, it wasn't a massive night for long-running franchises, and I don't think I can handle the lamentations. And, while I'll admit that my initial skim of the trailers for familiar names came up a tad short, I'm not at all disappointed, because it looks like 2023 is going to be a stellar year for devs doing something cool with a new IP while learning a lot from their older projects.\nRead more",

However, if you were hoping to get in on some PC / console crossplay action regarding the game's multiplayer, you may be disappointed, as publisher Sega confirmed to me today that they have \"no plans to support crossplay between PC and consoles for multiplayer at launch\".\nRead more",

They filled me in on how the game's blend of fairies and reality-hopping realmwalkers has progressed over the past year - and it turns out that players have had a lot to do with it.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Until yesterday, all we had was a codename (“Süßkartoffel”, or Sweet Potato), and a few other scant business facts developer Mimimi Games posted about on their blog last year. In fact, the only concrete thing we really know about it right now is that it’s not going to be Shadow Tactics 2. \nHowever, in chatting to Mimimi this week about leaving real-time tactics behind in favour of their new \"Stealth Strategy\" label, I’ve managed to glean a few more details. Alas, Mimimi still aren’t ready to reveal Süßkartoffel’s official name just yet, but head of design Moritz Wagner told me it’s not only going to be much more beginner-friendly than their previous games, but that it will also be much more like one big sandbox this time, resisting the urge to limit players by strict level constraints. To me, it all sounded a bit like they were aiming for something akin to Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, so I asked him about whether that was an accurate assessment of it. “Yes and no,” he said.\nRead more",

          "description": "The makers of Shadow Tactics: Blades Of The Shogun and Desperados 3 have been thinking a lot about real-time tactics recently. Not just because they’re knee-deep in making their next tactics game at the moment, currently known as Codename Süßkartoffel (the word for \"Sweet Potato\" in their native German), but because they feel the genre as a whole doesn’t quite convey what’s so special about their catalogue of excellent stealth ‘em ups anymore. It’s a fair cop – despite appearing in our best strategy games list for many years, even I’ve struggled to come up with a succinct way of describing them. Thus, it’s time for a change, say the studio. \nIn a blog post published today on Mimimi Games’ website, the studio announced they’re going to be referring to their work as “Stealth Strategy” games going forward, and they’re hoping this new genre label will help prospective players better understand their special blend of silent assassination tactics. This kind of shift isn’t without its challenges, though, so I caught up with the team at Mimimi to talk more about this newfound shift, and how it’s going to lay the foundations for what’s to come in Codename Süßkartoffel.\nRead more",

It's hard to be terrified by something if the game pauses for over a second when it happens.\nAnyway, the point is that a patch was released over the weekend, and another yesterday.

          "description": "The Crucial P5 Plus is one of those drives that turn up in these deals articles a lot. That's because it's designed to undercut the likes of the WD SN850, Seagate Firecuda 530 and Samsung 980 Pro, offering slightly slower sequential speeds at a lower price point. That tradeoff is one that I'd make in almost every situation, as you'll definitely notice the extra money in your wallet more than you'll notice a fractional difference in game load times!\nThe P5 Plus's 1TB model is the one discounted today, with a drop to £90.86 - that's the lowest price we've ever recorded for this model and a good value for a high-end SSD suitable for PC and PS5. \nRead more",

          "description": "2023 is shaping up to be a great time for wartime RTS games. If Men Of War 2 and Company Of Heroes 3 weren't enough to keep you busy on the WW2 side of global historical conflicts, Petroglyph Games' The Great War: The Western Front will also be stepping into the trenches of WW1 at some point next year as well – literally, in this case, as planning, digging and capturing these muddy lines of defence will play a vital role in both its pre-combat Theatre Commander mode and busy real-time strategy battles. Recently, I got to play through one of its RTS battles, but what I found was a strategy game quite unlike its WW2 rivals. \nIn some ways, this shouldn’t be surprising. As Petroglyph Games’ lead designer Chris Becker tells me over email, “WW1 is known for being a war of attrition and a battle of inches,” leading to fewer sweeping power plays when it comes to securing a victory. Indeed, your main concern here isn’t so much the winning of each individual battle, but maintaining your side’s National Will, which Becker says will be \"in constant fluctuation\" throughout the campaign – and with both the Allies and Central Powers to pick from here, that could mean very different things depending on who you choose. \"It’s essential that players continue to monitor this, as the relentless toll that the war will take on National Will can result in overall victory or defeat,\" says Becker. \"Authenticity is at the heart of this, we wanted to truly represent what 'victory' meant in the war - even with success, there is cost.\"\nRead more",

          "description": "How the heck do you review Dwarf Fortress? Much like the procedurally generated world spat out at the start of every game, there’s already a huge pile of established lore and history out there from the 16 years it’s been around. It’s like being asked to review Lord of the Rings. It's a vast undertaking, and there aren't any friendly eagles on hand to cut through its dense mythos. Prior to releasing on Steam, I had put a few dozen hours into what is now known as Dwarf Fortress Classic (which is still available for free from Bay 12's website), split over several different periods of time. Thing is, I never really got very far. I’d find a good tutorial, lose a few fortresses to horrible mistakes and then really get established. But then I’d be distracted by the realities of everyday life and by the time I got back to it, I’d forgotten everything and all my resources were hopelessly out of date because of all the wonderful, lovingly detailed updates. Then the cycle would start again. \r\n\nThe good news is that this new version of Dwarf Fortress released on Steam does an admirable job of making the game considerably more approachable. I was apprehensive at first, but then something clicked and I lost the first of what would be many afternoons over the past fortnight, safe in the knowledge that when I eventually stepped away from this goliath, I’d be able to come back without feeling overwhelmed and have to start all over again. It’s still good ol’ Dwarf Fortress, but this is the most accessible the game has ever been while still being deep, demanding and a legend worthy of being inscribed on a mudstone goblet.\nRead more",

The game commences with a spectacular intro cutscene wherein a futuristic space-shuttle launches from Earth, breaking through the atmosphere to dock with a gigantic, revolving space-station like a chromed hubcap off some petrolhead's pride & joy. The cutscene neatly transitions into the play-perspective, where you see that same shuttle slide into the docking bay from the cold void outside. Welcome to the Tiqqun, Administrator.

Not only are these top-tier tracks from Mario Kart's past and present, but this is the first time the developers have really tried to lean into the gameplay innovations of Mario Kart 8, i.e., the anti-gravity mechanic.

You find The Industry's Chris Moyse at the end of a pretty exhausting week, packed out with behind-the-scenes dealings at Destructoid, mired in three games for review, and suffering from a severe lack of sleep. Reasons unknown.

Choosing an oblique 3/4 viewing angle, and sporting some delightfully cartoonish sprites, Pac-Mania offered a new approach to the pill-munching action of its 1980 predecessor.\nCheck out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber MegaMan52.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJFLJ5w88U\nOnce again, our boy is charged with dashing around a symmetrical maze, gobbling up power pellets, and staying one step ahead of the ghostly gang of Blinky, Pinky, Inky, Clyde, and \"Sue\". As a major game-changer, Pac-Man now has the ability to leap over his enemies, offering him a handy escape when cornered. Later stages introduce new ghosts... erm... \"Funky and Spunky\" both of whom also have the ability to take to the air, intercepting Pac-Man's avian action. A popular release in arcades and on the home market, Pac-Mania remains one of the most recognizable of the Pac-Man sequels.\nPac-Mania is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8. It should be noted that it is also included as part of Bandai Namco's compendium Pac-Man Museum +.\nThe post Pac-Mania takes the Arcade Archives to another dimension appeared first on Destructoid.",

A new suit filed by Riot claims that NetEase's Hyper Front is a copy of the tactical shooter Valorant.\nAs reported on by Polygon, Riot has field suit over NetEase's Hyper Front, which is also a team-based tactical shooter. According to the filing, Riot claims Hyper Front is a copy of \"substantial parts\" of Valorant.\nValorant launched on PC in 2020, and Riot is currently developing a mobile version. Meanwhile, Hyper Front was released in 2022 for mobile platforms on iOS and Android.\nIn the suit, Riot lays out the similarities. It's not just the number of players, but Riot points directly at maps, character designs, weapons, and even the raw numbers from the weapons. There are actual spreadsheets in the filing, comparing the data.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRao6FARFRo\nRushing the point\nRiot does note that NetEase made modifications to Hyper Front following the first complaints. However, the infringement goes further.\n\"All of our creative choices are mirrored in NetEase’s game,\" said Riot Games layer Dan Nabel to Polygon. \"We don’t think that changing the color of a character ability or slightly modifying the visual appearance changes the fact that it’s copyright infringement. It’s like that old saying, ‘You can put lipstick on a pig, but it’s still a pig.'\"\nRiot Games is seeking an injunction, which would likely essentially shut down Hyper Front, and \"substantial\", but unspecified, figures for damages. It's also litigating the claim in several courts around the world.\n\"We don’t want to rely on one particular market to have this issue resolved,\" Nabel told Polygon. \"NetEase is a global publisher, as are we. We want them to know that we take the matter very seriously.\"\nThe post Riot Games is suing NetEase over Hyper Front, claiming it copies Valorant appeared first on Destructoid.",

I also realize that Streets of Rage is a blatant rip-off of Final Fight. However, I just love the sense of style and the fact that it’s better suited to consoles.\nHowever, Streets of Rage doesn’t have Mike Haggar, former pro-wrestler and beloved mayor of Metro City. Haggar is amazing not just because he’s built like a pizza oven, but also because his backstory is so sparse you can apply whatever features you want onto him.

          "description": "Aloywood\nIf you're gagging for some more Aloy action, then Guerrilla Games has you covered, as the studio has revealed a new expansion, currently in the works for the PS5 edition of Horizon Forbidden West — The new \"Burning Shores\" DLC was revealed during The Game Awards yesterday evening.\nA brief trailer, which you can check out below, sees our spritely hero as she soars through the skies astride her trusty Sunwing. From there, she approaches a lush but swamped island, located south of the Tenakth Clan Lands. Upon approach, we the audience realize that our girl has wandered into a dystopian aftermath that was once Los Angeles, but has now become little more than a volcanic archipelago, littered with further threats charged by the force of \"The Machines\".\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShJuY6Zl2Aw&ab_channel=PlayStation\nAccording to the development team, Burning Shores will feature extended travel by land, sea, and air — offering players a brand-new location that can be fully explored via all three methods. Aloy will also find herself up against a terrifying new mechanical behemoth, which appears to be some form of crustacean hybrid if the splash art is anything to go by. According to Guerrilla, the scale of the DLC — in both size and visual fidelity — has led the team to focus on the PS5 platform only, suggesting that the new expansion will not be developed for PS4.\nHorizon Forbidden West is available now on PlayStation platforms — The Burning Shores DLC will launch on PS5 only on April 19, 2023.\nThe post Horizon Forbidden West DLC ‘Burning Shores’ coming to PS5 in 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

According to EXOK, Earthblade will feature seamless exploration, engaging combat, and \"countless mysteries\", as Nevoa explores the world, meets friend and foe, and overcomes numerous obstacles in their search for answers.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafFds3Ppb0\nFrom this conceptual trailer, it seems that Earthblade will feature a more typical open-world adventure experience akin to something like Team Cherry's Hollow Knight. But the recognizable charm and style of EXOK Games are readily apparent here. From the ethereal music and forlorn atmosphere to its intriguing character design — detailed in such simplicity — and the heavy leanings toward multi-directional world traversal and the satisfaction of the journey itself. I'll definitely be keeping an eye on this one, and fans of the strange and fantastical would do well to do the same.\nEarthblade is currently in development for PC.

Players will race to gather Wumpa Fruit for their squad, racing back to bank it in their home base while defending their stock from the opposing team and getting into frenzied melee scraps out on the battlefield. Each character will be afforded their own special skills and bespoke abilities, so teamwork and character synergy will be the key to claiming victory.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=becrLd9GOB4&ab_channel=CrashBandicoot\n\"We’re so excited to unveil our fresh new take on multiplayer in the Crash universe with Crash Team Rumble,\" said Toys for Bob's Paul Yan in a press release. \"Crash Team Rumble has something for everyone— easy pick-up and play for those who just want to jump in, while also providing skilled gamers the opportunity to leverage and master their hero’s unique abilities.\"\nWhile not quite the long-rumored Super Smash Bros. clone that people have been expecting, this all-new take on the wild 'n' wacky world of Crash could prove to be a pretty neat party title, and feels more in the vein of a Splatoon than a Smash Bros.

A new trailer offered up new hints on the sequel's highly dramatic narrative, while also sneaking in glimpses of several combatants returning to The King of Iron Fist Tournament.\nThe preview sees Kazuya Mishima, now fully possessed by the Devil gene, running amok throughout the planet, raining destruction down on its populace. Standing against him will be the newly-reformed Jin Kazama, charged with the blood in his veins and the spirit of his deceased mother in his heart. The preview is a pretty melodramatic affair, as one would expect from the Tekken franchise — but I'll be darned if it didn't make the Tekken 8 storyline look like a pretty cataclysmic affair.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tXTWVncFP4&t=77s&ab_channel=BandaiNamcoEntertainmentAmerica\nIn addition to the plot details, the trailer also featured some returning Tekken acolytes, including the fiery pro-wrestler, King, the man-mountain android Jack, Bruce-Lee-alike Marshall Law, his running buddy Paul Phoenix and the far-too-handsome-to-be-a-special agent Lars. We also catch a sneak peek at Jun Kazama herself, suggesting that she too will be making her return to the ring. All of this was rendered in dazzling current-gen technology, offering visual splendor yet to be seen in the long-running series. It's looking good.

A new trailer was also premiered, which you can check out below.]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQYHXpkX6kM&ab_channel=SquareEnix\n[Original Article]\nAs is often the case in the lead-up to The Game Awards, several rumors and leaks are floating around the information superhighway ahead of Keighley's grand festivities — Case in point: a tweet published by the Japanese PlayStation Twitter, pointing to an incoming demo for Square Enix adventure Forspoken.\nThe (now deleted) tweet sported some attractive new splash art, emblazoned with the words \"Demo Announcement Trailer\". The sudden removal of the tweet suggests that said video is cued to play during tonight's live TGA presentation. The deleted tweet also referenced an 11-minute Forspoken gameplay showcase, which will likely be hosted on the official PlayStation YouTube channel tomorrow, December 9, as part of Forspoken's continuing \"Deep Dive\" video series.\nhttps://twitter.com/Renka_schedule/status/1600756189943410689?s=20&t=8d2Qc74adzfu6ObMzVeGKQ\nWhile Forspoken has had something of an inauspicious start, with online jokesters mocking its marketing strategy and critics raising an eyebrow at some admittedly foolish PR speak, I personally think that Forspoken is an attractive title with potential. A 2023 GOTY contender? maybe not, but it could certainly prove a fun way to kick off 2023's gaming year. No doubt Square Enix hopes that allowing players to get their hands on a playable build, giving them the opportunity to explore Athia and meet hero Frey Holland — will help turn around some of this early cynicism ahead of the title's impending release.\nForspoken launches January 24 on PS5 and PC.\nThe post Forspoken demo available to download now on PS5 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Yoshi-P took the stage before the Game of the Year award was handed out to drop a new trailer for Final Fantasy XVI. Like with each of the game's previous trailers, this thing looks incredible and is bound to grab a few nominees at next year's award show.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GOtYqLkj2g\nOf course, the most important thing about that trailer is the announcement of the release date. The Final Fantasy XVI release date is June 22, 2023. And remember, it's coming exclusively to PlayStation 5.\nSince the game was originally announced, we've learned quite a bit about the upcoming action RPG. For starters, the game will not be open-world and will instead use a collection of large, explorable areas. Yoshi-P has also taken to the press to talk about the overall direction of the series moving away from its turn-based origins to become arguably the premier action RPG series in the world.\nFinal Fantasy XVI will be the first mainline entry in the storied series in nearly seven years. That's a long time to wait, but with Yoshi-P at the helm, I believe it will have been worth it.\nThe post Final Fantasy XVI begins its quest for revenge on June 22, 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

FromSoftware has confirmed it's working on Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon.\nRevealed tonight at The Game Awards 2022, Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon sees the studio return to the mech series with some serious production value. Check out the trailer below to get an idea for yourself:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKO1s-CUZvY\nThe new Armored Core entry is currently set for a 2023 launch. The trailer splash shows both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One alongside PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam.\nA return to a classic series\nIt's been a while since FromSoftware went back to the Armored Core series. The mech action lineage started in 997 on the PlayStation, and carried on through Armored Core: Verdict Day in 2013.\nThe early entries of Armored Core are certainly well-remembered. But as sentiment waned on newer releases, the series took a backseat. With the Souls games taking off, FromSoftware followed their trajectory, leading up to games like this year's Game Awards heavyweight Elden Ring.\n\nFromSoftware has certainly earned enough goodwill from fans to revisit the series. I'm looking forward to seeing how those who jumped on with the Souls series take to the giant mechs and action of Armored Core. As someone who played a good few of them on his PlayStation 2 back in the era, I'm certainly keen to see what FromSoft does with this series years later.\nArmored Core VI Fires of Rubicon is currently slated for 2023.\nThe post FromSoftware reveals Armored Core VI Fires of Rubicon appeared first on Destructoid.",

Previous generation consoles, the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, are expected to get Colossal Cave sometime in Q1 2023.\nThis 3D version of Colossal Cave is based on the original Colossal Cave Adventure, a classic text adventure game. Sierra On-Line co-founders Ken and Roberta Williams have taken that classic and made it 3D, moving from words and descriptions into full-on environments. There's still a narrator though, to capture some of that original feel.\nThe goal is to traverse the cave, collect items, and return home safe and sound. Simple, it may seem, until you realize how much danger awaits in the cave.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBxihf4lIC0\nFind the treasure and escape the cave\nGetting a new version of a classic is something that happens quite often in games. But for both this particular game, and the developers behind it, Colossal Cave feels like a cool way to  honor the long legacy games have built up over the years.\nI'm fascinated to dig into the cave for myself. This was a segment of PC gaming I never got around to, and it's been re-imagined by developers who have a lot of respect for the era. And Colossal Cave being playable in virtual reality on the Meta Quest 2 is pretty neat, too. This is a neat convergence point of gaming history to kick off 2023.\nThe post Colossal Cave embarks for a new journey on January 19 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Hell opens back up in 2023\nThe deepest dungeons and demon-infested catacombs are open for business again next year. Blizzard Entertainment will launch Diablo IV on June 6, 2023.\nThe latest dungeon-crawler from the Blizzard crew revealed the date at tonight's Game Awards 2022. Tonight's cinematic trailer includes a lot of evil demons, one shining warrior in particular, and plenty of doom and gloom.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsNDMHvz98M\nBack into the dungeons\nEver since the reveal of Diablo IV at BlizzCon 2019, there has been speculation of when we might finally see the latest Diablo emerge. Rumors have bounced around, and Blizzard itself had to temper expectations as to when it might arrive. A sizable leak of the game dropped not too long ago though, adding more fuel to the fire.\nIt's all happened as Activision Blizzard has been caught up in a storm of events. The lawsuits, the still-pending acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft, and unionization of the QA team at Blizzard Albany have all transpired between that 2019 reveal and now.\nAdding on top of the pile is a report published today from The Washington Post. In it, employees at Activision Blizzard tell the Post that the June 6 date will be hard to meet without working significant overtime. Sources allege mismanagement, including crunch that's incentivized by company stock shares and DoorDash credits. There are also details about a previous version of Diablo IV's script that involved the rape of a female love interest, in order to have a grittier tone. Employees reportedly fought it, and eventually managed to get this version of the story revised.\nBasically, a lot has gone down since that first reveal, and it sounds like development has been troubled, to say the least. We did get some recent hands-on impressions, and it seems like things are coming together. But there's a lot of baggage hanging over this sequel now, headed into an actual launch.\nThe post Diablo IV locks in a release date for June 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "We’re approaching the end of 2022, and we’re concluding the year by going back to our Super Replay roots by tackling an old-school survival horror game. In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch each Friday at 2 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. \nIn 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.\n\n\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

The long-in-development action/RPG is finally nearing release, and we got a confirmed release date this evening. You’ll be able to confront demons to your heart’s content beginning on June 6, 2023.\nWhile the trailer didn’t offer a wealth of new details about the game, it did show off a pretty epic battle between the forces of Heaven and Hell. The forces seem to be led by Tyrael on one side and Lilith on the other side, and two massive armies clash over the course of the battle.\nCheck out the full trailer for a glimpse of Blizzard’s top-notch cinematic storytelling.",

The announcement arrived alongside a new trailer and details surrounding the game's Collector's Edition.\nThe Collector's Edition includes a 25-centimeter Mindflayer vs. Drow battle diorama made from high-quality PVC/ABS plastic, an approximately 160-page hardcover art book, character sheets, a cloth map, a tadpole keyring, 32 die-cut stickers, three Magic: The Gathering booster packs featuring characters from Baldur's Gate 3, an oversized metal Baldur's Gate 3 D20 die, and a Collector's Edition certificate. The Collector's Edition will cost $270 and will be limited to 25,000 units worldwide.\nOn top of that news, we also received a trailer showing beloved characters Minsc and Jaheira's return, as well as the gameplay debut of the City of Baldur's Gate. You can see the trailer below.\n\n\nPrior to the August 2023 1.0 launch, Larian will release Patch 9, which will include various improvements to the Early Access version, including a new playable class. Details of that will be revealed during a special streamed panel on December 14.\nBaldur's Gate 3 has been in Early Access since 2020, so this August 2023 release window is a long time coming. Since that Early Access launch, Baldur's Gate 3 has achieved a \"very positive\" rating on Steam user reviews, with nearly 50,000 reviews logged as of this writing.

          "description": "Death Stranding 2 – the sequel to one of the best games of the previous console generation – was announced tonight during The Game Awards. As you might expect from director Hideo Kojima, it was baffling. \nThe trailer begins with Fragile, played by Lea Seydoux (No Time to Die, Crimes of the Future), running from some kind of threat while carrying a BB (a baby in an artificial womb; it's a whole thing) in tow. We then get a brief look at Sam Porter Bridges – the protagonist of the first game, played by Norman Reedus (The Walking Dead) – who Fragile tells, \"It's time for you to hit the road and start a new journey.\" Then everything truly goes off the rails. \nGiant mecha vehicles (not too unlike the titular Metal Gears from Kojima's previous series at Konami, Metal Gear Solid). Primary antagonist Higgs dressed like President Amelie Strand and playing an electric guitar. A BB pod full of tentacles. The ominous question, \"Should we have connected,\" casting doubts on the entire objective of the first game – connecting the United States – all quickly flashes onscreen. If it sounds like a lot, it is. Check it out for yourself below:\n\n\nWe're calling it Death Stranding 2, but from the looks of it, the game is actually named DS2. Also, aside from the previously mentioned movie stars, it features Elle Fanning (The Neon Demon) and Shioli Kutsuna (Deadpool 2). \nDuring a brief interview after the trailer, Kojima revealed he and his company, Kojima Productions, are also working on another video game project and other \"visual\" works.\nNo real release information was given, though the game is once again being published by Sony. The trailer also said the footage was captured on a PS5. So, it might be safe to assume Death Stranding 2, like Death Stranding before it, will have some window of exclusivity on Sony platforms. Guerilla Games will also be acting as a support studio, and its proprietary engine, Decima, will once again be used for the game.",

Longtime Santa Monica Studios lead Eric Williams directed the sequel, which released last month. \nFortunately for all of us, though, Barlog was able to convince Judge that quitting was not the right call. Judge touched on this during his lengthy speech at The Game Awards 2022 after accepting the award for best performance in a video game.\n\n\nHere's what he said: \n\"I think it's kind of common knowledge that we were honored to go to Tribeca after 2018, and when Cory took me outside and said he wouldn't be directing the next one, I literally did quit. I quit. And he said, 'Nah, I vouch for Eric.' And I said, 'Eric Williams better be a beast.' Eric Williams is a motherf---ing beast.\"\nIt's unclear if Judge legitimately quit or if he was just using these words to express his initial disappointment that Barlog was not returning to direct Ragnarök. Nonetheless, Barlog vouched for Williams, and now we have Ragnarök, one of our highest-rated games of 2022 here at Game Informer.",

The character is dubbed the “Princess of the Underworld” but given the previous game’s nod to Greek mythology, there’s a good bet that this new character has some interesting ties to the big players in that well-known pantheon.\nBeyond the intriguing trailer, there’s no word on release date or console platform plans, but we do know to expect new details on Early Access in 2023, and that the game is coming to both Steam and Epic Game Store on PC.",

It's called Judas, and if you're a BioShock fan, you'll be happy with what you're about to see. \nTo say this title follows in BioShock's footsteps would be an understatement. From its industrial sci-fi look to its first-person dual-wielding, superpowered action, Judas sports the familiar trappings of Levine's work at Irrational Games. Ghost Story describes it as a single-player, narrative-driven shooter and provided this tantalizing synopsis:\n\"You are the mysterious and troubled Judas. Your only hope for survival is to make or break alliances with your worst enemies. Will you work together to fix what you broke – or will you leave it to burn?\"\n\n\nLevine formed Ghost Story games in 2014 after he closed Irrational, only taking on a small group of designers from the former studio. They've been working on its first title ever since, though whether that game has always been Judas remains to be seen. After years of mostly silence, many wondered if we'd see anything come out of the studio; it was reported earlier this year that the team's first project had gone through a rocky patch. Thus, it's nice to see the fruits of their labor finally.\nJudas doesn't have a release window, but it's coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

Unfortunately, the ravaged planet is now occupied by dangerous oil-drenched creatures called Devourers that Gaia must contend with as she clears the world of their corruption. After Us places a big emphasis on traversal, as Gaia can glide, jump, and dash across abstract environments, spreading beauty along the way.  \n\n\nAfter Us will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC next Spring.",

According to Nintendo, \"Players who purchased the Old Picture Book at Rodin’s shop, The Gates of Hell, using in-game currency and unlocked it with three keys will be able to access the teaser.\"\nOriginal Story, 12/8/2022:\nHot on the heels of Bayonetta 3's release in October, tonight during The Game Awards, Platinum Games and Nintendo announced Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon. \nStepping away from the series' traditional gameplay and visual style, Origins plays out in a cel-shaded art style and an isometric camera angle. It was hard to get too good a grasp on the gameplay from the trailer, though it does look akin to the Viola chapters from Bayonetta 3 – where the player character's combat actions are deemphasized over summons instead. Additionally, it appears that the main summon is Cheshire, who indeed was Viola's only summon in Bayonetta 3. Though time will tell if Origins fairs better. \nNarratively, you play as a young Bayonetta – or Cereza, as is her actual name. You can get a better idea of the overall story and see the game in action in the trailer below:\n\n\nBayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon will be released on Nintendo Switch on March 17, 2023.",

The game will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC sometime in the future, but a release date was not revealed. \n\n\n\"Hellboy Web of Wyrd is a roguelite action adventure with an original story created in partnership with Dark Horse Comics and creator Mike Mignola,\" the game's Steam page reads. \"When an agent goes missing, Hellboy investigates. Prepare for monstrous toe-to-toe brawling.\" \nAs you can see in the trailer above, it's clear Upstream Arcade is aiming for Hellboy Web of Wyrd to feature a visual style reminiscent of Mike Mignola's original Hellboy comics. It's easy to see how characters, enemies, and more from those comics could be integrated into the game with such an art style as well.\n\nUnfortunately, we'll have to wait to learn more but Hellboy fans will want to keep Web of Wyrd on their radar (especially given how tragically few Hellboy games out there exist). \nAre you going to check out Hellboy Web of Wyrd?

The news was announced via a brief animated trailer. \nThe trailer didn't reveal too much about the DLC, nor did it show any looks at gameplay. Though, given Dead Cells is a Castlevania-inspired indie rogue-lite, we likely assume the core formula will remain roughly the same. The game's Steam page offers a bit more info: A gateway to a striking castle has suddenly appeared, and an imposing warrior called Richter asks you to help him vanquish the great evil within. Enticed by the promise of new loot rather than a sense of moral duty, you strike out through the grounds and corridors of the gothic castle to find and kill this mysterious Dracula.\n\n\n Additionally, the Steam page boats 51 classic Castlevania songs, 12 newly reimagined tracks, and a brand-new storyline. Gameplay unfolds throughout a fully-explorable Dracula's castle and will feature 14 Castlevania weapons, readapted into Dead Cell's gameplay, three \"epic\" boss fights, and 20 outfits from \"Alucard, Richter Belmont, Simon Belmont, Maria Renard, Trevor Belmont, Sypha Belnades, or even Dracula himself.\"\nNo specific release date was given, but Return To Castlevania is expected to be released sometime during \"Q1\" 2023. It will be available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC.",

But Mina The Hollower was never meant to be the studio’s next game. It was a side project of Yacht Club Games designer Alec Faulkner - one that no one but him knew existed.\nAfter raising over $1.2M on Kickstarter in February, I wanted to learn more about Alec’s journey from intern to game director, how he pitched his “Gothic Prototype” to the Yacht Club, and ultimately, how the team rallied behind him in hopes of delivering another series as prolific as Shovel Knight. The result is a 36-minute documentary covering the making of Mina The Hollower, which you can watch below.\n\n\nIf you enjoy this video game documentary, please consider sharing the link on your favorite social media site or share it with a friend.

It follows the exploits of Erik and his sister, Mia, well before they met up with The Luminary and follows them on their adventure to find treasure, escape vikings, and jump on top of the heads of monsters in order to reach higher platforms. Unlike Dragon Quest 11, Treasures is an action game with open environments and a focus on collecting valuables. It releases December 9 on Nintendo Switch and we will have a review for the game on gameinformer.com soon.\n\n\nFor more previews of some of the biggest games of 2022 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Inkulinati, Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion, Save Room, Pokemon Scarlet, Resident Evil Village: Shadows of Rose, Persona 5 Royal on Switch, Scorn, LEGO Bricktales, God of War Ragnarok, Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope, and more.",

          "description": "Microsoft has announced that it’s raising the price of first-party Xbox Series X/S games to $70 beginning in 2023. \nIGN first confirmed the news, with a Microsoft spokesperson telling the outlet that \"This price reflects the content, scale, and technical complexity of these titles.\" First-party Xbox Series X/S games such as Starfield, Redfall, and Forza Motorsport will be among the first titles to have the $70 price tag when they arrive next year. The price of Xbox Game Pass appears unaffected, and the Microsoft spokesperson continued by saying, “As with all games developed by our teams at Xbox, they will also be available with Game Pass the same day they launch.” \nGiven the increasingly exorbitant cost of triple-A game development, the price rise was only a matter of time. In an October live interview with The Wall Street Journal, Xbox head Phil Spencer said as much when he stated that the company couldn’t keep its products at the same price forever. \"I do think at some point we'll have to raise the prices on certain things, but going into this holiday we thought it was important to maintain the prices.\" \nSony was the first console maker to charge $70 for its PlayStation 5 first-party offerings at the start of this generation. In August, Sony raised the price of the PS5 itself in multiple international territories, citing inflation as the primary reason; Microsoft immediately responded by saying it had “no plans to raise the price of the Xbox Series X/S consoles.” Of course, that statement was made before Spencer’s comments to the WSJ, and Microsoft declined to comment when IGN asked about the potential of a hardware price raise.\nAs a reminder, the $70 tag only applies to current-gen titles. PS4 and Xbox One games have and will remain $60, the former standard established during the PS3/Xbox 360 generation. \n[Source: IGN]\nWhat do you think of Microsoft adopting the $70 price? Let us know in the comments.",

          "description": "Palworld, AKA “That bizarre Pokémon-ish game with guns”, has a new trailer that puts names to the many cuddly faces that star in this over-the-top adventure.\nMeet the Pal, the monsters that roam Palworld’s colorful yet kind of messed up world. These cuddly though often dangerous critters include the seemingly love-obsessed Lovander, grass panda Mossanda, and Tanzee, which is basically Grookey if it possessed a love for the AK-47. Sure, some of them boldly walk the line of being outright copies of existing Pokémon, but these can carry guns, which we imagine is enough of a separation to repel any lawyers. Check out the latest trailer below. \n\n\nPalworld first gained attention in June 2021. Developer Pocketpair bills the experience as a multiplayer open-world survival game as opposed to a turn-based RPG like Pokémon. As a human character, you can capture, befriend, train, battle, and breed Pal. If you consider yourself a bigger monster than what you're catching, you even sell, eat, and outright exploit Pal for labor. On top of that, you can build houses, battle poachers, and construct factories to put your critters to work. Palworld looks nuts, and we're still not entirely convinced it's a real video game, but we certainly want it to be. \nThankfully, Pocketpair plans to release Palworld in Steam Early Access sometime next year, so we'll hopefully get a chance to try it out sooner than later. The game is currently slated for PC.",

Today, the upcoming action game made its first peep since its last showing in 2021, showing off its frenetic combat and stylish flair. \nLost Soul Aside began life as a solo project by developer Yang Bing. Its 2016 proof-of-concept trailer impressed many with its triple-A caliber presentation and Devil May Cry-inspired action, including Sony, who scooped up the project as a third-party PS4 exclusive. Bing is now working with a full team, Ultizero Games. Sony announced last year that Lost Soul Aside will come to PS5 as well. The adventure stars protagonist Kazar and his shapeshifting dragon companion, who transforms into various weapons for Kazar to wield. \n\n\nDespite being officially announced for years, today’s video is billed as an “announcement trailer” presumably reintroducing the game to newcomers while reminding everyone else that it still, in fact, exists. The gameplay looks as polished as it ever has, though sadly, we still have no idea when we’ll get to play it. \nLost Soul Aside will be available on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.

          "description": "Multiple beta releases often indicate lots of bugs to be fixed, but in this case we got carried away adding features and thought more testing was needed. New features since beta1 include: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. A new Generate World menu which now includes NewGRF, AI, and Game Script configuration menus. Cargo filters for vehicle lists (such as at stations) to allow better visualization of traffic. Optional cargo names above vehicles in vehicle lists, to show at a glance what they carry. The ability to clone or share orders with vehicles grouped by shared orders. An improved local authority action window which now shows you actions you can’t afford, instead of hiding them. In addition, some new tools are available to AI and Game Script authors: Scriptable league tables which can replace the default scoring system AI and Game Scripts can now be modified in Scenario Editor for existing scenarios (although not savegames) (As ever, see the changelog for further details).
