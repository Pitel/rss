          "description": "Maddeningly good fun.\nBerserk Boy has been tipped as a Mega Man-inspired 16-bit adventure, but it’s actually closer to Inti Creates Gunvolt series, and even then feels markedly different.\nTaking place in a future world where a scientist named Dr. Genos has gone rogue, you play Kei, a young boy who teams up with firebird Fiore to battle his way to saving the universe. The narrative isn’t particularly noteworthy, but it’s well handled with attractive intermittent stills and quick dialogue exchanges. It’s certainly less intrusive than the Gunvolt series in this respect, interjecting just enough story to make things whole without making you labour through excruciatingly drawn-out reams of waffle. Instead, its waffle is brief, occasionally mildly amusing, and mostly to the point.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

I haven't played an Outlast game since reviewing the second numbered game and having excitable opinions about its portrayal of the moon. I'll be honest, I'd assumed the series had died, but Steam user reviewers seem pretty keen on Trials, which takes the first game's mucky asylum premise and spins it out into a low-key live service game about playing a series of human guinea pigs, trying to escape an experimental brainwashing lab run by the villainous Murkoff Corporation. \r\n \nRead more",

The first was to discover if there's anything genuinely different about this undeniably enchanting but very familiar sequel to one of the happiest, barmiest action-RPGs of the past 20 years. The second was to royally screw myself by fielding a party consisting exclusively of magic-users. \r\n\n\r\nIn Dragon’s Dogma 2 as in Dragon’s Dogma 1, you lead a gang of up to three AI-controlled \"pawn\" characters – one permanent main sidekick who levels up alongside you, plus two auxiliary pawns created by other players, who are either summoned at Rift stones or spawned into the open world as hired help. As in most RPGs, the ideal party setup is a mix of pure melee, ranged and magical DPS or support classes, but given the whimsicality of Dragon’s Dogma’s sorcery, with its levitation spells and lightning whips, I’ve always wanted to try a whole playthrough as a posse of unescorted occultists.\nRead more",

Speed is, ultimately, the modus operandi of a car. It gets you where you need to go faster than a horse, and doesn't do annoying things like pooing on your patio or dying (also, potentially, on your patio). Surely, then, playing a game about cars moving at the speed of a dead patio horse defeats the point, like playing a first-person shooter where all the guns fire backwards.\r\n\n\nExpeditions: A Mudrunner Game demonstrates this not to be the case. This bouncy, slimy off-roading simulator is the most fun I've had with an imaginary car since 2018's Jalopy. This is partly because it is as much a physics puzzler filled with limitless conundrums as it is a game about driving, but also because, like Jalopy, it envisions the car as something more than a way to boost egos by doing a big circle.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "When we first meet The Thaumaturge's hero Wiktor Szulski, we're told he's a man cursed by the vice of pride. It's a trait that sits at the heart of his personality, and in this particular alt-history telling of Polish turmoil in Warsaw at the turn of the twentieth century, such 'Flaws' can also attract the attention of otherworldly beings called Salutors - vicious creatures of myth and folklore who follow their quarry around like dark and gloomy shadows, amplifying their worst qualities and, in many cases, driving them to emotional, and often violent, extremes. It's these outbursts that Wiktor will be investigating over the course of this curious detective RPG from the makers of Seven: The Days Long Gone and the upcoming The Witcher 1 Remake, as fortunately for him, Wiktor comes from a long line of storied Salutor tamers, his thaumaturgic know-how allowing him to see these monsters made flesh, exorcise them from their human host, and use them for his own gains.\nHe's a man that's ultimately made peace with his own arrogance, then, but considering everything he goes through during The Thaumaturge's 25 hour-odd run-time, I reckon his pride is pretty justified. Not only is he able to brush off multiple stab and gunshot wounds and clubs to the face when he gets in a fight, but he also achieves several feats of thaumaturgy that we're repeatedly told are thought to be nigh on impossible. Indeed, at the start of this game, his connection with his original Salutor Upyr is hanging by a thread, his worst instincts having got the best of him in a recent attempt to tame and capture a second beast from the ether. By the end, however, I had six Salutors at my beck and call, out of a total of eight. Wiktor is very much a force to be reckoned with, and he makes for a highly compelling lead as you navigate the branching storylines in Warsaw's political hotbed.\nRead more",

There's a meteor scheduled to slamdunk the planet in 30 days, and in that time, you and your fellow players must progress from raising log cabins in the woods to building the means to develop technologies that might somehow avert the apocalypse. The trouble is, pioneering said apocalypse-averting technologies might itself bring about disaster in a gameworld that simulates things like habitat death, species extinction, air pollution and catastrophic flooding. \r\n\n\r\nPlayers must thus walk a careful line between resource exploitation and self-inflicted calamity by monitoring their impact on the overall simulation, founding the right kind of government, and passing laws or devising economies (including player-created currencies) that don't flip the ecosystem upside down. The Steam reviews teem with anecdotes about people waking up to find their oil wells underwater, and it sounds like things will only get knottier when Eco releases out of early access around the end of this year.\r\n\n \nRead more",

When I finally saw the sun again, I could have cried.\nIt’s still a bit wonky, but the full 1.0 release makes the Forest a fuller, livelier and more inviting (or else alluringly off-putting) prospect for a wander - even, as in my case, a wholly solo one.

As development on their debut game, the spaceship building puzzler Sunshine Heavy Industries, began winding down, \"we were throwing all kinds of stuff at the wall,\" he says, including games in 3D, a platformer, with Driscoll revealing they even had \"a Terraria-like one for a couple of weeks\" with a grid-based world that characters bounced around in. But it was playing Inscryption that brought everything to a head. Both had spent hundreds of hours with Slay The Spire, but \"Inscryption proved to us that there was still a lot of space to explore in the genre,\" says Guerra. And with increasing calls from Sunshine Heavy Industries players begging them to let them fly the ships they were creating in its shipyard sandbox, \"you can kind of see how that went from A to B\".\nRead more",

Of course, there's little to complain about when games like Cuphead or Owlboy finally see the light of the day, demonstrating what wonders growing ambition can often bring.\nHaving said that, I’m not entirely surprised that Vladimir Semenets, the lead game designer of Militsioner, sits in front of me on Zoom and tells me how they initially envisioned a six-month project, \"something very fast\". Yet, here we are, three years and more than a dozen developer vlogs since TallBoys' surreal runaway sim first captured everyone's attention (including one state-owned Russian news channel). If not for its Kafkaesque premise, which pits players against a ten-story tall looming policeman in a quest to escape a small town, then definitely because of the game’s ambitious voice recognition feature that promised real-time conversation instead of pre-written dialogue.\nRead more",

I cannot remember for the life of me which level(s) it contained. My only surviving memory of it is having quite a good time blasting Stormtroopers and the chaps in black with the swoopy, knock-off Vader helmets, but also getting terribly lost and not really knowing what the heck I was meant to be doing. Now, playing Nightdive Studio's Star Wars: Dark Forces Remaster as an adult probably close to three decades later, both these feelings have come roaring back, as this is very much a Star Wars FPS in the vein of Doom and other early 90s shooters (thumbs up). But it's one that leans so hard into its maze-like level design that it can regularly feel like a little bit of a tough hang in the cold hard light of 2024 (thumbs down).\nCrucially, though, not to the point where it's best left consigned to the history books. This is still an enjoyable and worthwhile artefact in Star Wars' PC gaming history, and if your eyes (and general patience levels) can't quite stomach the 'Classic' and still available 1995 original, then this remaster is a pin-sharp glow-up for modern hardware.\nRead more",

I thought that it should not have been marketed as main game DLC instalment when it pivoted to being a magical girl dating sim. This serves to show how unrealistic dreams can be; in my waking hours I am, of course, of the clear-eyed awareness that a magical girl dating sim is entirely in-keeping with the rest of the Dragon Age oeuvre.\nI'm worried about Dragon Age. I'm worried that so much cost has been sunk, team members changed and redrafting did that it'll end up kind of a mess. But that's the pessimism talking. What I'd like to propose is that all the big game companies have a crack at something similar to Amazon's (hiliarious and abortive) attempt to officially license fan fiction, which was called Kindle Worlds.\nRead more",

          "description": "“Ever since the very first Yakuza on PS2, the Like A Dragon series has always tried to capture the cultural zeitgeist of Japan, reflecting and satirising whatever’s trending around when the game comes out. This means that the way people speak in Like A Dragon is constantly evolving to match the times,” says Dan Sunstrum, senior translator at Ryu Ga Gotoku’s localisation team. Keeping things current is, says Sunstrum, “a challenge in some ways but also means we’re justified in using modern English slang to match, whereas such modernisms might feel out of place in a game set in a completely fictional world.”\nSunstrum uses an example from the studio’s latest, RPS Bestest Best winning RPG Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, where permed protagonist Ichiban Kasuga meets a dating app designer. “The app’s creator goes on a mini-rant about ungrateful, entitled users, complaining how when anything goes wrong they’re quick to demand wabi-ishi,” slang for free premium currency. “This would have been a tricky word to localise, but it was made easy by the fact that fans of gacha games had already done it for us: they refer to them as ‘apologems’, and that’s what we ended up using in the game.”\nRead more",

Za tu dobu se online setkalo už 719 unikátních přezdívek a celkově se prokecalo 100 hodin. Tak neváhejte a doražte si taktéž popovídat o elektronice, IT a technice obecně. Z připravených témat mohou strahováci nabídnout novou stabilní verzi KiCADu nebo simulátor QSpice s podporou digitálních bloků. Letos se na trhu objevil 6 GHz osciloskop relativně dostupný i pro bastlíře. Do použitelného stavu se dostal také automatizovaný 3D scanner, který si můžete doma vytisknout. A ukáží i solid state vysoušeče vzduchu, které nepotřebují žádnou údržbu a mají minimální spotřebu.\r\n\r\nZe světa softwaru zmíní přinejmenším nového majitele Altium Designeru nebo volně dostupné sborníky článků o bezpečnosti a reverzním inženýrství.\r\n\r\nA pokud máte rádi naše okénko bizarností, pak Vás jistě pobaví seznam nepravd o čase, kterým věří programátoři. Jestli navíc k tomu chystáte svou zahradní techniku na sezónu, tak si možná můžete zahrát Doom na sekačce.\r\n\r\nPříští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve středu 6. března od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

One of the prominent changes with the NVIDIA R550 Linux driver is bringing the GeForce and workstation GPU support up to \"CERTIFIED\" quality when using NVIDIA's open kernel modules that are distributed as part of their driver package. Previously the open-source (out-of-tree) kernel modules were just certified for their data center GPUs while now they are basically acknowledging that they are in good shape too for GeForce and workstation products. In this article are some benchmarks of the open and proprietary kernel driver options of the NVIDIA R550 Linux driver.",

With that, don't be surprised to learn that you can now get customized Xbox Series X|S controllers themed after the post-apocalyptic franchise.\n\n\nThe latest news story over on Xbox Wire shows the control pads that have been given some Fallout love. I don't mean they're highly irradiated. Rather, there's a bunch you can now get from the Design Lab that you could argue have been inspired by the games.\n\n\n\n\nThere are actually four variants to pick from: Vault Dweller, Brotherhood, Pip-Boy, and Mutants. Each of them comes with the same basic covering on the controller, but with slightly different colors to the D-pad and analog sticks.\n\n\nI feel so S.P.E.C.I.A.L. now\n\n\nIf you've never used the Xbox Design Lab, it basically allows you to create your own Xbox control pads by customizing the look. You can change the color of the main body, add rubber grips on the back, and put some engraving on it as well.\n\n\nObviously, with this latest one boasting an official Fallout design, it's not going to be cheap. A basic controller with the new look – and nothing else being changed – would set me back just under $85. Who says gaming isn't an expensive hobby?\n\n\nThis also comes just a day after it was announced that a SpongeBob SquarePants-themed Xbox Series X would be launching this week. March 7, to be precise, if you're interested. Not me, though. Guess I'll be sticking with boring black for now.\n\nThe post You can now get a Fallout-themed Xbox Controller through Design Lab appeared first on Destructoid.",

In fact, I  need to work out a system to let everyone know I'm not the real me. For now, let's take a look at a curious monstrosity that's coming to id Software's iconic FPS.\n\n\nOver on ModDB, user Anya_Forger is in the midst of modding Doom 2 so that reminds us all of the pain that once was 1996's Bubsy 3D. It's a curious mix, I have to admit, but it remains to be seen why this is happening at all. I'm weirdly excited for it.\n\n\nImage via Anya_Forger/ModDB.\n\n\nCurrently, \"Bubsy Doom\" is still a work-in-progress, with no release date yet. For now, you can download a small taste, which converts the classic Doom menu screen into the one from Bubsy. There are plans to hopefully incorporate levels and MIDI sounds from the latter into the former, but currently the creator is busy with real-life obligations.\n\n\nIt could breathe new life into the long-forgotten games\n\n\nWhile the modder is planning to bring Bubsy 2 into Doom as well, it's the mention of incorporating Bubsy 3D that will be cause for some curiosity. It's generally regarded as one of the worst games ever released, which in a way makes it a pretty significant part of gaming history.\n\n\nAnd for all we know, Anya_Forger may actually enjoy the game. Who are we to judge? All I can say is they seem genuinely excited about making their project, saying \"aren't these mod developers wonderful?\"\n\n\nIt's also another notch in the bedpost of Doom modding. There are so many out there, from Doom meets Friday the 13th to Doom but all the sound effects are from Half-Life. We've seen it all. Well, nearly all.\n\nThe post This cursed mod mashes up Doom 2 and Bubsy appeared first on Destructoid.",

I mean, we all know it's been heavily inspired by Pokémon, but if you want to see it veer even closer, a recent demake project really makes the world look like Pokémon.\n\n\nAs spotted by WCCFTech, YouTube channel 64 Bits recently uploaded a proof-of-concept video that shows what Palworld would look like as a DS game. This includes giving it the retro look and top-down view you'd imagine it would have if it was released on the Nintendo console.\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, the description under the video says the team was heavily inspired by \"Pokémon Ranger, Black, White, Diamond, Pearl, basically all the DS Pokémon titles.\" However, they've also taken some cues from the likes of The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass.\n\n\nA plethora of your preferred pixelated pals\n\n\nThe video itself really does show what Palworld could potentially look like if it was truly styled after older entries in Nintendo's dominant IP. It's actually quite cute. However, it should be noted that it is just a video. As far as I can tell, there's no attempt to actually demake the game in this manner.\n\n\nNor would anyone likely dare. If Nintendo is keen on pursuing Pocketpair over copyright issues, there's no way the community would risk litigation by making their own similarly-inspired project.\n\n\nAs for the game itself, it feels like we're passing through the tail end of Palworld's initial popularity. The studio is still sending out updates, but we're probably not going to see another uptick until the game fully releases, whenever that's going to be.\n\nThe post Wanna see Palworld as a Nintendo DS game? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "When it launched last October, Alan Wake 2 was noted as a superb follow-up to its cult Xbox 360 predecessor. Visually, it was something to behold. However, being quite a graphically demanding game meant people with older hardware were left out—until now.\n\n\nRecently, Eurogamer was given exclusive access to an upcoming patch for Alan Wake 2 which aims to optimize the sequel for previous-gen graphics cards. Specifically, the update will put focus on making the game compatible with Nvidia GTX 10-series GPUs, powered by the Pascal architecture.\n\n\n\n\nIn a benchmark test, a Digital Foundry video found that, once the patch starts rolling out on March 6, those with GTX hardware should see some pretty significant upticks in performance.\n\n\nIt's not a cure-all, though\n\n\nCurrently, the likes of the GTX 1060 (which is the fourth most used GPU on Steam) don't support mesh shaders, something AW2 uses for better visual acuity. However, the new patch should fix this. \n\n\nThe video above shows that framerates do increase, boosting overall performance by around 45%, even up as much as 85% for the likes of the GTX 1080.\n\n\nHowever, the aforementioned 1060 is still not entirely suitable for the game to run at a decent rate. While Digital Foundry saw increases from 15 to 25 frames on average (thanks to the removal of mesh shaders) in dense areas, this still falls short of what most gamers expect these days, which is 30fps at the very minimum.\n\n\nThere also appear to be no optimizations for the AMD equivalent, the RX 580, a card that came out in 2017. Given that Team Red is no longer supporting this GPU, it's probably not in Remedy's best interests to make Alan Wake 2 compatible with this (and much older) hardware.\n\nThe post Alan Wake 2 patch will optimize the game for older Nvidia GPUs appeared first on Destructoid.",

We also have a release date, with one of the models launching on March 8 in the US, followed by the other two variants a week later.\n\n\nAs reported by Videocardz, the Claw is up on sites like Newegg, with options to place a pre-order ready for launch day. There are three variations planned, and it looks like the mid-range device releases first, priced at $749. Which is not cheap, really.\n\n\n\n\nFor that price, you'll get a Windows-based handheld gaming PC with an Intel Core Ultra 7-155H CPU under the hood and 512GB of NVMe SSD storage.\n\n\nAnd many more initialisms\n\n\nThere is a cheaper model in the Intel Core Ultra 5-135H variant, which also comes with 512GB capacity. This is currently priced at $699 on Newegg and with a March 15 release date.\n\n\nThe same goes for the more expensive Claw, which will set you back $799. That benefits from the same processor as the mid-range model but does have 1TB of SSD storage.\n\n\nOn top of this, MSI recently announced that the Claw also comes with seven days of Ubisoft+ for free. Whether that's going to justify the cost is dependent on how often you're likely to use Ubisoft's service, I suppose. Also, the fact that the above tweet says the offer available is from February 15 is a bit odd seeing as the device isn't even out yet. Not sure if that's a typo or not.\n\n\nIn any case, we're seeing quite the flood of Steam Deck competitors hit the market lately. We've already had offerings from ASUS and Lenovo, but it feels as though Valve's mobile PC is still a lot of people's first choice for now.\n\nThe post Steam Deck’s latest rival, the MSI Claw, releases this week appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "El Paso, Elsewhere developer Strange Scaffold has announced a five-game deal with publisher Frosty Pop. As part of the announcement, they’ve revealed a trailer for their next game, Life Eater, which is out on April 16, 2024.\n\n\nI find this trailer rather unsettling.\n\n\n\n\nThe trailer shows off the game’s timeline interface where you must learn the habits and schedule of your quarry so that you may find the opportunity to abduct them. You play as a “modern day druid” who is tasked with performing an annual sacrificial ritual to delay the end of the world. It looks like once you have your quarry, you then take their organs to “water the flower.”\n\n\nLife Eater looks to be a rather evocative game. It has you violate the lives of others while framed as someone performing a necessary evil. Just the fact that you’re learning intimate details of the lives of others and monitoring them for the moment to strike is rather discomforting. The information on the game even suggests that the whole “dark god” angle might be false. I'd play it.\n\n\nThe store page promises “replayable blend of authored and generated stories.” It features music from David Mason who was the composer of Dredge.\n\n\nAs an aside, there are modern-day Druids, as Druidry is a modern religion based on pagan cultures. I don’t think they generally converse with dark gods and perform sacrifices. Just weird to see that as a contextual descriptor.\n\n\nLife Eater releases on PC on April 16, 2024.\n\nThe post Strange Scaffold’s disturbing kidnapping sim Life Eater is out in April appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Denis Villeneuve's Dune: Part Two film wormed its way through theaters over the weekend, and if you've still got sand in the brain, there's plenty more where that came from. Namely, Funcom shared a closer look at the upcoming Dune: Awakening survival game, which is in the works for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.\n\n\nTo bridge the gap more elegantly, let's start with the \"Creating Worlds, from Book to Film to Game\" developer diary. This one has Funcom CCO Joel Bylos and Oscar-winning cinematographer Greig Fraser (Dune: Part One and Two, Rogue One) talking about what it takes to adapt something like Frank Herbert's classic novels. Dune: Awakening is ostensibly a survival/crafting game at its core, but those traditional survival elements eventually evolve from physical to political. See where the inspirations came from and how they expanded upon the world depicted in the film adaptation below.\n\n\n\n\nThe timing of Dune: Awakening's production seems to have paid off, particularly in the way they were able to visit the actual sets from the film in an effort to bring the world to life more accurately. The new tech utilized in Unreal Engine 5 certainly didn't hurt either, and it's cool to see how it also helped in previsualization for the films. \n\n\nFor another look at what all that work is building up to, you can see some cinematics and gameplay in the new trailer.\n\n\n\n\nHow well Dune works in the open world survival genre remains to be seen. As for when we'll be able to run for our dear lives from every Sandworm rumbling beneath the surface, that also remains to be seen. There's no release date in place for Dune: Awakening just yet, but hopefully, we'll know more soon. \n\nThe post Your chaser for Dune: Part Two is a new look at the Dune: Awakening survival game appeared first on Destructoid.",

One significant collaboration coming to MW3 and Warzone is Warhammer 40K. You're probably familiar with the ultra-popular franchise; it's made its way from books and tabletop games to video games and more. Soon, WH40K will be appearing in Call of Duty.\n\n\nSpace Marines, Sisters of Battle, and Astra Militarum skins come to Call of Duty\n\n\nAccording to a tweet from the official Call of Duty account, skins inspired by the Warhammer 40,000 universe are coming to the game. Over the last few weeks since Season 2 launched, there have been leaks and hints about the collaboration coming soon. But this is the first official statement directly from the developers themselves. The tweet doesn't show details about what the characters look like in-game, just a small teaser image.\n\n\nMost likely, the Warhammer 40,000 collaboration will come as an in-store purchase. This means it'll be something like $20 or more, as most items in the CoD store are. Hopefully, it comes with all three character skins in one and maybe a few other small cosmetics or a gun camo to really beef up your Warhammer loadout.\n\n\nHints of what's to come\n\n\n\n\n\nNothing official was announced about the contents of the upcoming collaboration, but a few leaks have surfaced. The data miner who first leaked the collaboration tweeted this video of the character select screen, among others.\n\n\nThe Warhammer 40,000 x Call of Duty collaboration content should be coming soon as we're almost to the start of season two reloaded.

Developer Half Asleep announced plans to bring its chill beats to PlayStation 5 on March 12, 2024. \n\n\nTrue to the name of the devs themselves, Melatonin is all about bridging that gap between our reality and the world of dreams. Naturally, the best way to do so is through the lens of a rhythm game, complete with an appropriately dreamlike color palette and audio and visual cues that get the beat across without relying on traditional genre overlays and indicators. If you haven't checked it out yet, you can see a quick sample in the PS5 trailer below.\n\n\n\n\nMelatonin launched on PC via Steam and Epic Games Store back in December 2023, with a Switch version following close behind. Rhythm game pros can up the challenge with hard mode, while those who just want to chill — which is understandable given the overall vibes of the game — can toggle various assist features to make it easier. There's a story mixed in with all that nice hand-drawn art, too, as you explore the protagonist's dreams and learn more about them in the process.\n\n\nIf you just want to make your own scenarios, there's also a level editor that lets you remix and mashup game stages. The PC version lets you use your own song files as long as you know their exact tempo, but it's not clear if the PS5 version offers the same suite of features. All we know about that part of the game is that it's billed as an \"easy-to-use\" tool, so we'll see how much of that holds true this time next week. In the meantime, you can just pop your headphones on and let the beat roll over you. \n\nThe post Dreamy rhythm game Melatonin hits PlayStation 5 on March 12 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The single-player Metroidvania adventure explores the personal journey of actor Abubakar Salim after his father passed away. Based on his speech at the Game Awards, Tales of Kenzera: Zau is meant to challenge the harsh realities of grief, reclaiming the spirit of Zau's father.  \n\n\nNexon's The First Berserker: Khazan, an RPG Souls-like RPG, is also among those listed explicitly by Xbox Wire. The Xbox Partner Preview showcase will provide more information about the life of the playable character, General Khazan. The entry also adapts from the world of Nexon's Dungeon Fighter Online (NFO). \n\n\nThe three mentioned above are the only games we know about, but there will likely be more gameplay features to come. This includes more release announcements and reveals, similar to other recent events. Tune into Xbox's YouTube or Twitch channels on March 6 to see what other adventures await for the Partner Preview. \n\nThe post Xbox announces Partner Preview stream slated for this week appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It's clear by now that Helldivers 2 is way more than just a simple bug hunt co-op shooter. On top of its surprisingly deep gameplay mechanics and an ever-evolving campaign narrative, though, there's a whole extra layer of community-based meta-progression, with Supply Lines being a particularly notable highlight.\n\n\nIf you've been befuddled by how Helldivers 2 chooses which planets the Terminids and the Automatons attack next, it would appear that it's not all just the whims of a potentially sadistic dungeon master. According to a Helldiver 2 community member, Ghoxen, there's an entire Supply Line feature carefully hidden away from public eyes dictating how the war efforts progress, and it's way more intricate than the game might otherwise have you believe.\n\n\n\n\nHelldivers 2's Supply Line mec…",

          "description": "It’s not unheard of for games to feature nods to other games and eagle eyed players of The Sims 4 have noticed a less-than-subtle reference to Final Fantasy XIV’s Shadowbringers expansion in the latest Sims 4 Stuff Pack, Crystal Creations. \n\n\nPlayers noticed this rather obvious (at least to those Simmers who play FFXIV) reference in the description of the Spire-Shaped Gemstone. If you hover over the gemstone, its description reads, “Your own mini crystal tower than an exarch would be proud of.”\n\n\nIt's a clear nod to a fan-favorite character, the Crystal Exarch, from Shadowbringers. That, and the actual crystal tower, the centre of everything in the First and the stage for A Realm Reborn's Alliance Raids. Plenty there worth commemorating in a precious stone given what the 24-man raid eventually built up to. \n\n\n\n\nThe Sims 4 has other FFXIV secrets, too\n\n\nIt’s not the first time that the Sims 4 devs have thrown FFXIV references into the game, either. In the Werewolves pack, one of the items carries the name “Racked Teak-a Greatshelves.” It's another nod to more landmarks from the MMO, The Rak’tika Greatwood, a Shadowbringers zone. \n\n\nMore recently, in the Growing Together Expansion Pack featured one item, a small board filled with childrens drawings, among a long list of others. The swatches of this particular piece feature various references to FFXIV moments, one particularly obvious one being an image of a long-tailed blue bird flying around the planets. If you know, you know. \n\n\nImage via Gryphi on YouTube\n\n\nThese references are clearly intentional and the Devs behind their inclusions are not quiet about their love for FFXIV. The dev responsible for the Racked Teak-a Greatshelves, SimGuruNova, has admitted in the past that they use far too many Fantasia. Importantly, though, they noted a preference to play as either Miqo’te or Au Ra during MSQ progress. There's something I can't blame them for. \n\nThe post The Sims 4 pays tribute to FFXIV again with cheeky nod to the Crystal Exarch appeared first on Destructoid.",

As per the recent livestream from Spiders, Greedfall 2 will pivot into relying more heavily on community feedback for future updates. \n\n\nAccording to Spiders' producer Reba Isber, the Greedfall community was eager to provide feedback on the original game via reviews and other means.

Anyway, here's id Software's iconic FPS running on a toothbrush.\n\n\nJust a few days ago, Twitter user atc1441 (thanks, Rock Paper Shotgun) uploaded a brief clip showing Doom running on a smart toothbrush. On the tiny screen of the Planck Mini, you can just about make the game out. The modder even goes as far as showing it being controlled by a mouse.\n\n\n\n\nIn a second tweet, we see they eventually managed to get it to run full-screen rather than in a small window. Now we can see the thing much clearer.\n\n\nFight demons...and tooth decay\n\n\nAccording to atc1441 – who says their biggest passion is to \"custom firmware on as many devices as possible\" (no way) – the toothbrush itself, \"contains an ESP32-C3 with 4MB Flash.\"\n\n\nUsing some additional downloads and a \"miniwad\" of Doom, they were able to compress the game down to the 4MB required for the flash. Hey presto: Doom on a toothbrush!\n\n\nI don't think I'll ever get bored of the ways people can modify id's influential shooter, either tinkering with the original or getting it to run on all manner of devices. Just have a look: Doom on a robotic lawnmower, in an audio spectrogram, on a pair of earrings! \n\n\nOne day we're going to reach the singularity and someone will boast how they got Doom to run inside Doom. Oh, wait.\n\nThe post Sink your teeth into a port of Doom playing on a smart toothbrush appeared first on Destructoid.",

But it's still doing pretty well for itself, and if you are carrying on with it, you may be interested in this pretty nifty mod for the PC version.\n\n\nAs spotted by DSO Gaming, you can now add a mini-map to the Palworld UI, thanks to user T3R3NC3B over on Nexus Mods. Seems like such a small addition to the game, but given that it shows the location of all pals, it could well be an essential download for a lot of people.\n\n\nImage via T3R3NC3B/Nexus Mods.\n\n\nHere are just some of the features that \"Paldar\" comes with:\n\n\n\nShows player world location\n\n\nShows all Pals around you\n\n\nShows fast travel points\n\n\nShows other players\n\n\nShows lifmunk effigies\n\n\nShows dungeons\n\n\nShows chests\n\n\nShows skillfruit trees\n\n\nShows rare/shiny pals (indicated with the sparkles overlaid on the pals icon)\n\n\nShows bosses on map\n\n\n\nProbably shows you where you left your keys as well\n\n\nIt also has a \"mega zoomed-out mode for easy navigation.\" As this is a work-in-progress, there are plans to also add in displays for death locations, player and NPC camps, the ability to hide the mini-map, and more. So keep an eye out for updates to this mod.\n\n\nT3R3NC3B says the download is compatible in both single-player and on dedicated servers, though \"only if installed on clients.\"\n\n\nWith version 0.1.5.1 coming out recently, Palworld continues to iron out some of the kinks. It's still in Early Access, after all. Developer Pocketpair also said the game achieved over 25 million players not long ago. It must be doing something right, then.

          "description": "Having turned 20 last year and being a dominant force in digital PC gaming, it's hard to imagine Steam got off to a rocky start when it launched in 2003. However, here we are, and the Valve service continues to reign supreme, as it reaches another concurrent player milestone.\n\n\nAccording to the latest figures from SteamDB, 34,649,583 players were using Steam over the weekend. To put that into perspective (not that it really needs it), Worldometer shows the population of the UK is over 67.8 million people. This means Steam's new record was roughly half of the UK populace.\n\n\nScreenshot via Destructoid.\n\n\nThis might partly because of the ongoing Dinos vs. Robots sale (as well as the many events that take place throughout the year), which ends today. Who knows, but it goes to prove that PC gaming in the modern era is showing no signs of slowing down.\n\n\nSome were twiddling their thumbs, though\n\n\nOkay, so 34.6 million is a staggering amount. However, of those, only (\"only\") 11.1 million were actually in-game, according to the breakdown below the graph. In total, the number equates to a 3.8% increase over February 2024. There. That's a little extra statistic for ya.\n\n\nOriginally built as a way for people to update Valve games over the internet, a lot of people struggled to adapt to the digital changes that were about to happen in gaming. As a result, Steam was not very popular during its early years.\n\n\nThat seems inconceivable these days what with how the industry operates. Nowadays, we probably couldn't imagine a world in which we can't instantly download a game or a much-needed patch, especially given the state some releases are in on launch day.\n\nThe post Steam set a new concurrent player record over the weekend appeared first on Destructoid.",

Pre-ordering the PC version also earns the following unlocks: New Game+ Horse, Traveler’s Attire, and Broken Armor dyes from Baku’s shop. \n\n\nDeveloper Sucker Punch has partnered with Nixxes Software on this PC port. The game has been optimized for PC with unlocked frame rates, custom mouse/keyboard controls, and various graphical settings.\nPer the PlayStation Blog post, “NVIDIA DLSS 3 and AMD FSR 3 are available with both upscaling and frame generation options. Intel XeSS upscaling is also supported and if your hardware has headroom to spare, you can use NVIDIA DLAA or FSR 3 Native AA to further boost image quality.” \nGhost of Tsushima on PC also features ultra-wide monitor support, including 21:9 and 32:9 resolutions, as well as 48:9 resolutions for triple monitor setups. \nGhost of Tsushima first launched for PlayStation 4 in 2020. It stars Jin Sakai, a samurai fighting to protect Tsushima Island from invading Mongols in 1274. The open-world game gives players the choice to take enemies down honorably (face-to-face in combat) or to utilize stealthier, more dishonorable tactics to rescue the island. You can read our review of the original version of Ghost of Tsushima, in which we scored it a 9.5 out of 10, here, and our glowing impressions of the Director’s Cut here.",

          "description": "In August 2023, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem arrived in theaters, and, much to the delight of both longtime and newer fans, it was a terrific and fun watch. Just over a month after its theatrical debut, Paramount and Nickelodeon announced that publisher Outright Games and developer A Heartful of Games would be releasing a follow-up video game set in the Mutant Mayhem universe. While it hasn't had a name to this point, Game Informer can now exclusively confirm that the title is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed.\nWarning: This article contains spoilers for the 2023 film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.\n\nThe 3D brawler/platformer picks up after the events of Mutant Mayhem; the Turtles have been accepted by society following their heroics against Superfly and his band of mutants. Unfortunately, their dream of attending high school as average, everyday students is suddenly interrupted by a new wave of mutants invading New York City. Featuring an all-original storyline, Mutants Unleashed aims to have the same brand of humor as the 2023 film.\nPlayers take control of the four hero turtles, each with a unique playstyle, as they fight their way through the sewers and streets of New York. Outright Games touts how immersive both the world above and below ground is, as well as the cast of familiar faces for the brothers to meet and fight. As co-op is a massive piece of the history of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles video games, players can enjoy two-player local co-op in Mutants Unleashed. \nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed is set to arrive near the end of this year for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. For more info on the other big TMNT video game in development, The Last Ronin, head here for our exclusive interview with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles co-creator Kevin Eastman.",

While Eastman and Laird never got around to creating that storyline in the original run of their comics under their company Mirage Studios, the idea stuck with Eastman through the years, and decades later, as part of the franchise's new life with IDW Publishing, he worked with his longtime collaborator Tom Waltz to bring the idea to the pages of a five-issue miniseries that ran from 2020 to 2022.\nThe story is bleak and gritty, establishing a universe where the four beloved brothers have been taken out one by one.

          "description": "Amazon Studios' TV adaptation of Fallout is right around the corner, premiering April 12 on Amazon Prime. You can check out a trailer for it here, but ahead of its debut, Microsoft and Bethesda have revealed a new Xbox Series X/S controller inspired by the popular post-apocalyptic game series, and you can pick it up right now. \nThat's because it's actually a new Fallout-themed design in Xbox Design Labs, which is where you can customize Xbox Series X/S controllers with pattern designs, unique colors, grips, and more.\n\n\nAs you can see in the image at the top of this story, the controller features the marquee Vault Boy holding his own controller on top of a black and white pattern of the various iterations of Vault Boy that have appeared throughout the series. The Xbox controller logo sits within the Fallout logo, and the d-pad retains the yellow-ish/gold color associated with Fallout as well. However, you can customize things like the d-pad, triggers, and more to have different colors if you'd like. \nIt's a great-looking controller, but it does come with a higher price tag compared to a standard Xbox Series X/S controller: $92.96. You can purchase it starting today. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Fallout 4 review, and then check out this new look at Amazon's Fallout TV series.

You could be forgiven for not being familiar with the character. Though he has made appearances in North America, he's never reached the popularity of his comic contemporaries like The Peanuts Gang or Mickey Mouse. I only became aware of the character after visiting developer Remedy in Finland in 2015 for our Quantum Break cover story. Members of Remedy's team educated me on the character and I brought back Moomin merchandise as souvenirs for my family.\nI had not thought much about the character since then, but recently, Moomin and his friends have been slowly invading my life prompting me to wonder if Moomin is on the verge of a United States popularity breakthrough. Developer Hyper Games and publisher Raw Fury must have thought the same thing, because it is releasing a Moomin video game on March 7.\nCheck out the video below to learn more about Moomin and see the cozy game in action.\n\n\nHead over to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

The sequel to developer Spiders’ 2019 RPG Greedfall was first announced in 2022.\nPremiering during last week’s Nacon Connect event, the trailer shows off the game’s customizable protagonist, a captured native of the previous game's setting of Teer Fradee, three years before the events of the first Greedfall. Forcibly relocated to the colonists’ continent of Gacane, you must escape by any means necessary. Like the first game, that includes using force, diplomacy, or cunning to forge your own choice-driven journey on this unfamiliar continent. The game features several factions to join and/or battle with, along with companions, romance options, and a revamped combat system with players controlling four characters at once. \n\n\nSpiders says Greedfall 2 is far more ambitious in scope, so it has decided to launch the game in early access via Steam to gather valuable feedback from players. Spiders also shares this initial version of the game will feature the entire beginning of the game, and players can explore roughly a quarter of the game’s full content. The game will receive regular updates, but saves will not be compatible between these different updates. You can learn more about what Greefall 2 entails by watching the developer deep dive video below: \n\n\nOnce its early access period concludes, Greefall 2: The Dying World is slated to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

It blends real-time strategy with tower defense. Set in a world devastated by an event known as the Cataclismo, you must rebuild. During the day, this means you’ll gather resources to construct fortresses brick-by-brick in a Lego-like fashion, along with placing soldiers and traps. Once night arrives, waves of monsters assault your stronghold, and you must repel them.\n\n\nThe game boasts realistic physics simulations (e.g., your strongholds collapse in a realistic manner, including falling debris that can squash enemies), and you can upgrade your fortress with improved building elements, troops, and more. In addition to a 30-hour story-driven single-player campaign, Cataclismo features a creative mode, a wave-based survival mode, and a battle-focused skirmish mode. \nCataclismo launches on July 18 for PC, and has a free Steam demo available now.",

Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.\nJoin Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

First revealed during last year’s Game Awards, the studio held a special livestream presentation where it revealed the game’s early access release date: April 18.\nNo Rest for the Wicked takes place in a dark medieval fantasy world where a deadly plague has befallen an island community, transforming citizens into monsters. You play a chosen warrior to fight against this blight. Combing elements of Diablo, Dark Souls, and even Animal Crossing, you’ll fight for survival while restoring the town of Sacrament. No Rest for the Wicked also happens to be Game Informer’s latest cover story.\nAlthough No Rest for the Wicked will be on Steam via Early Access for the foreseeable future, the game will come to consoles when it eventually launches into 1.0. Our digital cover story launches on March 5, and you can keep an eye out for exclusive features and videos in our cover story hub.",

However, the game will still be available to play. \nPlayers who boot up the game have been greeted with a message, posted below, announcing that on March 4, Crash Team Rumble will get its last content drop. The game is not shutting down, though. The base experience will remain live and players will have access to a free 500-tier battle pass. This includes 104 new items from all content across Seasons 1 through 3 and all available event rewards. Developer Toys for Bob has also disabled Crash Coin purchases, and players can use any remaining coins to buy battle pass tier skips.\nCrash Team Rumble launched last year on June 20, meaning the game's support only lasted for roughly seven months. While it's nice that the game won't be disappearing for the time being (especially since it's quite fun), it's a bummer to see its support dry up so quickly. \nWe quite enjoyed Crash Team Rumble, scoring it an 8 out of 10 in our review. Writer Aron Garst writes, \"Crash Team Rumble's take on multiplayer platforming madness is unique, with enough depth to keep you on your toes after hours of gameplay. Those searching for a fresh take on the long-running series should give it a try.\" \n\n\nIn related news, Toys for Bob announced that it's splitting from Activision Blizzard to go independent and potentially partner with Microsoft.

We had a great time with it – read Game Informer's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth review here – and one of the many reasons we enjoyed our 80-plus hours playing is because of the various relationships within the game and Cloud's party. Whether you're Team Clerith or Team Clifa, or maybe Team Cloud XIII (is that a thing?), there's plenty that will leave you satisfied. \nChief among those things is the special date night that happens within the Gold Saucer. We won't spoil when it happens in the game, and we won't discuss it in detail here, but we do want to let you know that we spent dozens of hours maxing out our relationships with each party member. That means we were able to take part in all possible dates at the Gold Saucer, and we captured each for you to watch below. \nHere's Every Gold Saucer Date In Final Fantasy VII Rebirth\n\n\nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth review, and then check out our guide of the best side quests in the game.

Embracer is selling the developer to a group of private investors in a deal worth $500 million, a source told the publication. \nOnce the deal goes through, Saber Interactive will be a privately owned company and free from Embracer, which is behind layoffs spread throughout the past couple of years. Following the transaction, the studio will continue work on its Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake, which it took over as the developer after Aspyr Media was removed from it in 2022. \n\n\nBloomberg reports this sale is another effort of Embracer to cut costs alongside studio closures and layoffs after a planned $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group fell through in 2023. The publication writes one of its sources says the $500 million deal comes with the option for Saber Interactive to bring with it multiple Embracer subsidiaries as well. \nSaber Interactive is also working on the recently announced first-person Jurassic Park: Survival. \n[Source: Bloomberg]",

          "description": "A massive sweep of layoffs has rocked various Sony first-party studios today, including Naughty Dog, Guerilla Games, and Insomniac. Another victim is Firesprite Games, the UK studio behind The Playroom games and The Persistence, and an additional casualty from that studio is reportedly a new Twisted Metal title.\nAccording to Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, Firesprite had a Twisted Metal game in the works that has now been canceled. He reports that the game was a live-service title and very early in development, so it was not yet officially greenlit. You can read his full report here. \nNEW: As part of today's mass layoff, Sony has canceled a Twisted Metal live-service game that was in development at UK-based studio Firesprite, Bloomberg has learned.\nhttps://t.co/pvCDsS7yxe\nFebruary 27, 2024\nTwisted Metal was PlayStation’s original flagship series, launching a couple of months after the PS1 was released in North America in the fall of 1995. The series includes eight sequels/spin-offs, the last of which remains the 2012 reboot for PS3. Peacock’s well-received live-action series has at least kept the series alive and is getting a second season. \nThe number of layoffs to hit Firespirte is currently unknown. Sony acquired Firesprite in 2021, where it helped co-develop Horizon Call of the Mountain with Guerrilla Games. 900 employees have been laid off across several Sony 1st-party studios in various department. Blood & Truth creators London Studio has been shut down entirely. PlayStation Studios Hermen Hulst has cited overgrowth as the reason for the layoffs, and that the publisher has examined its portfolio of upcoming projects to determine which ones will cease production. It would appear that whatever this Twisted Metal project would have been, it's among several titles getting the axe. \n[Source: Bloomberg]",

          "description": "While the main headline event from today's Pokémon Presents showcase was the announcement of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, it wasn't the only new game that got announced. It shares that status with Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket, a new mobile game that allows players to collect, trade, and battle with the franchise's signature trading cards.\nCheck out the reveal trailer below:\n\n\nWhile there are several features available in the game, Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket seems to focus the most on the collection aspect, which is fitting given the renaissance of physical card games in recent years. While no details on microtransactions are given, the end of the trailer notes that players will get two free packs a day – implying that more than that might come at a cost.\nYou'll also be able to trade cards with other players and battle them online as well. The trailer also shows off immersive cards, which seem to feature a 3D cinematic inside the cards.\nThe app is being developed by DeNA (best known for their work on Pokémon Masters) and is due out sometime later this year. For more Pokémon cards, check out our Trading Card hub, which features some of our favorite pulls from the game's big releases.",

          "description": "During today's Pokémon Presents stream celebrating Pokémon Day, we got our first look at the next major title coming to the Nintendo Switch. Called Pokémon Legends: Z-A, the teaser suggests the game will be set in Lumiose City, a Paris-inspired area first seen in Pokémon X and Y. It's not just a long-awaited follow up to Pokémon Legends: Arceus – it's an overdue return to the world of Pokémon X and Y.\nCheck out some images from the trailer below:\n\nThe teaser, which does not contain any actual gameplay footage, shows a Pikachu hopping around a city made of glowing blue lines. While it's not immediately clear that the city is Lumiose, eagle-eyed fans will notice many familiar friends from that generation of games, including Pyroar, Flabébé, Klefki, and Hawlucha. These images are juxtaposed with architectural sketches and the words \"urban redevelopment plan.\" This would suggest that Pokémon Legends Z might take place during the construction of Lumiose City, putting it in line with the historical setting we experienced with Pokémon Legends: Arceus.\nOther than the teaser, details are scarce. We'll have to wait until 2025 to see more. Speaking of 2025, we also recently heard reports that Nintendo's Switch successor will come out no sooner than March of that year. For more Pokémon Legends, check out our review of Legends: Arceus, which we called \"a worthwhile spin-off adventure.\"\nAre you excited for Pokémon Legends: Z-A? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "If you don’t know me, I’m Owen Rudge, and have been involved in the online Transport Tycoon community for almost 25 years. Exactly 21 years ago, I received an ICQ message (look it up, kids) out of the blue from a guy named Ludvig Strigeus (nicknamed Ludde). “Hello, you probably don’t know me, but I’ve been working on a project to clone TTD for a while.” he said, more or less. He didn’t want to release this to the public yet, and wasn’t entirely sure what he was going to do with it. (He’d been working on it since 30th June 2002, so I guess that is technically the birthday of what would become OpenTTD…) Ludde sent me a copy of what he’d been working on, and it was very exciting indeed. It was a fully functional version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, written in C. Admittedly incomplete at that time, it was still quite remarkable.",

Powered by Firebase, it's the fastest and easiest way to test your app against real devices, including the Google Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, select Samsung devices, and more.\n\nAfter connecting to a device, you can deploy your app, view the display, interact with the device (including rotating or unfolding the device), and anything else you might do with a device over a direct ADB over SSL connection—all without leaving Android Studio. When you're done using the device, Google wipes all your data and factory resets the device before making it available to another developer.\nDuring Open Alpha, you can use Device Streaming at no cost. To get started simply sign into your Developer account from Android Studio and select a Firebase project. If you don't already have a Firebase project, it's easy to create one. To learn more, go to Device Streaming in Android Studio.\n\nGeneral fixes and features\nBelow is a list of general fixes in Android Studio Jellyfish | 2023.3.1 Canary 9 and Android Gradle Plugin 8.4.0-alpha09 These are a result of your bug \nreports, which help us to make Android Studio better.
