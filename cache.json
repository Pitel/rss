But back when the pandemic kicked off in 2020, developer Niantic had to change things up considerably to allow people to still play the game while also staying safe at home.\nNow, over two years later, as in-person events are returning and people are attempting to get back to a normal way of life, Niantic has started bringing back exclusive in-person raids to its augmented reality game, starting this weekend with a new raid during Community Day. But GO's game director Michael Steranka has told Eurogamer that this is a \"unique experience\" for this weekend, but the company hasn't ruled out making more exclusive raids.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

There's just something timeless about it, right? Not to mention there was a distinct lack of discourse around the graphics back in the day (okay, perhaps a slight resentment from fans at the slow evolution of the series' visuals, but that's about it).\nPokémon's visuals, in this writer's opinion, really peaked around Gen 5, which consisted of Pokémon Black and White, plus their immediate sequels. Now don't get us wrong, we're loving the look of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet so far, but we can't help but wonder what such games would look like with the older pixelated visual style in place of the more modern 3D graphics.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The decision was made as a result of the company's annual shareholder meeting on June 21st, the outcome of which you can read in full right here.\nActivision Blizzard has been embroiled in numerous allegations involving alleged workplace misconduct occurring within the company. Blizzard President J. Allen Brack, who was specifically named in the initial lawsuit, stepped down less than two weeks after those initial allegations in July 2021. In November, over 1300 Activision Blizzard employees signed a petition demanding Kotick's resignation. Most recently, the company's board of directors came to the conclusion that there was \"no evidence\" of any reported harassment of colleagues being tolerated by company management.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Digital Foundry highlights particularly poor anti-aliasing and texture filtering, exacerbated by the thin black outlines around each character.

          "description": "When I got a hands off look at Oxenfree II: Lost Signals, my analysis was that it looked a lot like Oxenfree and therefore if you liked Oxenfree you would like this. I have now played through a small bit of the game, a slightly extended version of the area I saw in the hands off preview, and my analysis is... largely the same.\nI know that's very boring, but it's also positive, isn't it? Oxenfree was good, and Oxenfree II looks to be doing those same things that made Oxenfree good. A 2D, side-on supernatural thriller with radios. Good thing remains good! In a world where sequels to beloved media seem to only get progressively worse, I'll happily take it (especially since this one is a Netflix-published project now). And although it's directly related to the first game, the characters and happenings in Oxenfree II are distinct enough that it's going to be accessible if you're new to the series. And even if you did play the first game, it's possible that Oxenfree II will be more thrilling and unsettling to you now, five years later.\nRead more",

This would involve, as they always do, a bunch of benchmark tests: repeatable runs through a specific area or sequence that would give an accurate indication of how different settings and hardware affect performance. In most games these are either quick and easy or time-consuming and easy, but not The Cycle: Frontier. Oh no.\r\n\n\r\nSee, without a dedicated benchmarking tool, running these kinds of tests requires a certain controllable environment, where variables are known and parameters can be reset in a click. This is not the case for The Cycle: Frontier, whose environment is usually trying to fucking kill you, particularly though the unavoidable presence of other players. I’ve never sat down to record some average FPS values only to spend half my time cowering behind a tree, fearful of being shot, robbed and – worst of all – forced to start work over again.\r\n\n \nRead more",

This is where most folks will stop and squee at the fact that player character Neon White is voiced by the incomparable Steve Blum, perhaps known best for his role as sonorous space cowboy Spike Spiegel in Cowboy Bebop.

The delay was originally announced on Sunday by the game’s regional publisher in China, NetEase, and was picked up on by industry analyst Daniel Ahmad on Twitter. The decision to delay came a few days after Chinese microblogging site Sina Weibo banned the Diablo Immortal account due to unspecified \"violation of related laws and regulations\".\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Last week Intel published a “quick start guide” for their upcoming Arc A-series graphics cards, including a “Supported Hardware Configurations” section that only specifically namechecked their own 10th, 11th and 12th Gen Core CPUs. Cue a heady mix of confusion and perturbation – surely Intel weren’t suggesting that Arc GPUs would only function when paired with an Intel CPU, and a relatively new one at that?\r\n\n\r\nNo, they weren’t, though the guide’s vague wording isn’t doing it – and worse, potential Arc users – any favours. Parts of the guide appear to conflate support for Resizable BAR with support for the Arc A-series in general, which further muddies things as Resizable BAR works on AMD Ryzen chips as well as those three Core CPU generations. I asked Intel directly for clarification and essentially, Arc GPUs won’t have such super specific CPU requirements just to run - though they’ll apparently perform better in systems that do support Resizable BAR.\r\n\n \nRead more",

There were some demos I was meant to play for, like, actual work, and then I ran into a puzzle wall or a bug or something so I just fired up Necrosmith again.\nNecrosmith is a 2D necromance 'em up that is also sort of a tower defence game. In the middle of the map is your evil lair, the Hall Of Bones, a sort of legally distinct Sauron's tower that gets more flying buttresses the more you upgrade it. If enemies (which can be packs of wolves or flying bugs or all manner of things) do enough damage to destroy it, you lose - so that's your defense bit. For the towers bit, you have to imagine that the towers can move on their own, and also that they're shambling undead monsters made from a jigsaw of different limbs you find, like an army of very unhygenic Mr Potato Heads.\nRead more",

As you might expect, I got subjected to some chugging framerates and a bit of body horror, but also found some great multiplayer shooting in Dysterra and terrific tile-placement in Above Snakes, which might just become a new personal favourite.\nRead more",

The RTS potential for an interplanetary ground war against overwhelming swarms of giant not-insects is obvious enough. But the dual spirit of most Paul Verhoeven films is a major reason that The Extraordinary Lust Of Dizzy (working title: Starship Troopers) still holds up 25 years on.\n\r\n\r\nTerran Command understands that. Certainly it nods to the satire here and there, but mostly it focuses on the shooting and desperate defences and evacuations instead. This was the right decision.

It's all about ecology and being one with nature. This does, at times, feel slightly at odds with the other eye-catching thing about Lightyear Frontier, which is a bloody massive tractor mech stomping about everywhere. \nRead more",

He’s one of the more memorable characters you meet in Tendershoot’s alternate reality web simulator, an angsty teenage boy whose home page is slathered in camouflage textures and GIFS of exploding handguns. Since release, Zane has become one of Hypnospace’s de facto mascots, a beloved dweeb that is abrasive but also kind of painfully relatable? It’s hard to laugh at Zane’s baggy trousers and love for Linkin Park-esque rap-metal when you grew up in the mid-2000’s. I mean, we all bought a dog lead from Wilkinson’s and hooked it between the belt loops on our jeans at one point, right? …right?\n\n\nAhem. Anyway. Announced earlier this year alongside Dreamsettler (a proper sequel to Hypnospace), Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer is an FPS spin-off that stars the fan-favourite teen. Slayers X is framed as being an in-universe project that Zane worked on as a teen, and has been uncovered by his now 37-year-old self, who is determined to finally see it released. There’s a short demo available as part of Steam’s most recent Next Fest, and I’m delighted to say it’s exactly what I hoped it would be.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "280mm is my favourite AIO liquid cooler size - cheaper than 360mm coolers while offering better performance per square inch - you just need a case that can accommodate the slightly larger fans. Normally getting a good AiO of this size costs around £100 to £180, but right now Amazon is offering the MSI MAG CoreLiquid 280R for half price: just £50. That's an awesome value for a high-performance CPU cooler that even includes RGB lighting. \nRead more",

Tinyfolks is not a \"story generator\" sort of game, but that fight removed any doubt that it was excellent.\r\n\n\r\nThere's no shortage of dungeon-ish turn based combat games, nor of those made of all the usual fantasy archetypes, nor of pixelly low-fi games with bleepy bloopy music. Nor again are we likely to run short of games that combine some or all of the above. But like a good meal, combining even the most common ingredients in just the right way can make them delicious.\r\n\n\r\nIt doesn't matter that you're a monarch ousted by evil forces, now set on reclaiming your land within 45 days by fighting tonnes of monsters until your team is tough enough to kill the big nasty. What matters is that you'll have a great time doing it.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Sonic is assisted on his journey by long-time pal Tails (Colleen O'Shaughnessey) and must face down the powerful and mysterious echidna, Knuckles (Idris Elba). The sequel was praised for its comical script and likable characters, but criticized for its length and relatively rote narrative.\nSonic the Hedgehog 2 is currently number eight in the Top Ten Highest Grossing Movies of 2022, with the sequel still yet to hit the financially lucrative box office markets of Hong Kong and Japan, which will likely add further coffers to the Paramount Pictures vault. Of course, the incredible success of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is a consistent reminder of how things could have been so different for the cinematic adaptation. Still, it's good to know that the \"original\" movie Sonic still eventually found his way into cinema history.\nSonic the Hedgehog 2 is available now on streaming services, with a Blu-ray and DVD release planned for August. Sonic Origins launches today on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Sonic the Hedgehog 2 has smashes past $400 million box office appeared first on Destructoid.",

The only catch is that you need to try the Sunbreak demo.\nIn case you weren't aware, Capcom announced the demo roughly a week ago during their \"E3\" showcase stream, and it went live on June 14. It features a selection of missions, including an ultra hard Malzeno showdown.\nHere's the list of Monster Hunter Rise bonus items for playing the Sunbreak demo:\n60 Mega Potions\n15 Pitfall Traps\n30 Energy Drinks\n15 Mega Demondrugs\n15 Mega Armorskins\nCapcom also points out that you can get the demo directly here on Steam, or here on Switch. Seems easy enough!\nWhile veterans will likely bawk at the items you'll get here, newcomers will probably want to take them up on the offer if possible. Having a ton of free items at the start saves you a lot of time, as you can get by most of the early story content through Mega Potions alone: not having to craft them is a huge plus. And you'll have that surplus by the time you actually work your way up to the Sunbreak expansion.\nhttps://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1539692222932713480\nThe post Monster Hunter Rise has a bonus item pack for Sunbreak demo users appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Saving Moonbury one potion at a time\nThe day I'll be tired of life simulators will be the day that I die, which is why I'm so excited to see another great game in the genre finally get a release date. Potion Permit is an adorable little life sim, and if you haven't seen it yet, you're in for a treat (you can also play the PC demo right now, by the way). The game is set in the small town of Moonbury, where an illness has spread. As the Medical Association's most skilled potion maker, the player is tasked with helping create the cure for the ailing townsfolk.\nLet's be honest, all of these games have a super cute art style, but I have to say Potion Permit has one of my favorite looks from a game like this in a long time. Plus, everything looks super polished, which is a huge plus going in. From the trailer, I can already get the sense too that we won't be in want of activities to pad out our playtimes.\nhttps://twitter.com/PQubeGames/status/1539579544805548032\nThere's a ton to do in Moonbury — aside from diagnosing patients, finding ingredients for potions, and of course healing them, players can get to know over thirty of the town's inhabitants, fight off fearsome creatures, and upgrade the town and the surrounding areas. There are some RPG elements too, but we haven't gotten a good look at what those might be just yet.\nOf everything Potion Permit has to offer, I think I'm probably most excited for all of the NPCs in the game. That's just around the number of NPCs you can give gifts to in Stardew Valley, and I don't want to play the comparison game too much here, but that always felt around just the right amount to me. Having a whole new cast of characters to befriend (and romance) in games like these is always a highlight for me, and I already have an NPC or two that I have my eyes on.\nPotion Permit will be available on PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and Steam on September 22, 2022.\nThe post Life sim Potion Permit brews up a fall release date appeared first on Destructoid.",

The kings of the black-and-green brand spoke about its hardware troubles in a recent statement to gaming outlet VGC, who had noticed a lack of stock online and in the high street.\n\"We know it may be hard finding Xbox Wireless Controllers right now due to supply disruptions,\" a Microsoft spokesperson told VGC. \"We’re working as fast as possible with our manufacturing and retail partners to improve this. Please check with your local retailer for availability.\"\nThe shortages appear to be most apparent in the UK and Europe, though North American territories are likely to follow suit if Microsoft is unable to ramp up production. According to ResetEra users, stores in Australia and The Netherlands are also struggling to keep their stock cupboards plentiful. Both standard controllers and Xbox's cool custom \"Design Lab\" models are affected.\nHardware and accessory shortages have continued to trouble the industry since the COVID-19 pandemic affected production and distribution cycles worldwide.

XSEED and Marvelous confirm today that Rune Factory 5 is getting a PC port on July 13.\nThe latest entry in the Rune Factory series launched earlier this year as a Nintendo Switch exclusive. The Steam version looks to be a similar offering. It's $59.99 for the standard edition (though it's currently on a pre-launch 15% discount) or $69.99 for the Digital Deluxe, which includes the Rune Factory 4 marriage candidates outfit set. Any pre-order also nets two cosmetic outfits and a New Ranger Care Package of items in-game.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Edy6Bx_G8\nFarming up a storm\nIf you're new to Rune Factory, it runs in a similar vein to Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley. The key difference is that Rune Factory puts a bit more of a focus on combat and exploring dungeons than the actual farming.\nDepending on what you're looking for, that can be a positive or negative. In our review of the Switch launch, Rune Factory 5 seemed to be playing the hits, while not necessarily winning over new hearts thanks to falling into some familiar pitfalls. Things can get repetitive and basic at times too.\nWhat a PC port might offer is a performance boost, which some might welcome. All-in-all, I was a big fan of Rune Factory 4 but stayed away from the next entry after hearing some early impressions of it. I'm hopeful the Steam version gives it enough of a boost to put it back on my radar.\nRune Factory 5 launches for PC via Steam on July 13, 2022.\nThe post Rune Factory 5 is coming to PC on July 13 appeared first on Destructoid.",

A third-person action-adventure, DreadOut 2 tells the tale of hardy schoolgirl \"Linda Meillinda,\" (holy shit), who must use her psychic ghost-whispering powers to uncover and banish an army of spooky spirits that are haunting her town. Much like the popular Fatal Frame series, Linda is aided in her efforts by her camera... though the Camera Obscura here is replaced by... a smartphone.\nExplore Ms. Mellinda's hometown, speak to members of both the living and the dead, take on an array of side-quests, venture into dark, desolate, and disquieting corners, or just take a literal hammer to the bonce of the undead. Keep your proton pack, Spengler. DreadOut 2 expands upon the original game with a tighter focus on both exploration and combat, but is still jam-packed with terrifying monstrosities and more than a fistful of jump scares. While it's no Resident Evil, it will certainly fit the bill for those looking for a few ghoulish scenarios on a tired evening.\nDreadOut 2 launches July 15 on Xbox platforms, with PlayStation to follow on July 20, priced at around $20. It is available to purchase right now for PC via Steam.\nThe post Cult horror sequel DreadOut 2 coming to PlayStation and Xbox in July appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Silver Fox\nSurprise! Turns out that Nexon is still not done revealing characters for its upcoming fighter DNF Duel, which is literally less than six days away from launch. Today's DNF Duel trailer introduces us to the Lost Warrior, who carries with him the undeniable presence and physical aura of a potential boss character.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqaHE0JwIJ8\nThe Lost Warrior, as you can see in the video above, carries himself with the visual appearance of primordial times, but with a fighting style and mastery of magic beyond his years, suggesting that he may be capable of visiting multiple worlds and eras. Lost Warrior commands the battleground with devastating large strikes, reminiscent of King of Fighters' Rugal. The silver fox is also capable of switching positions with his opponent and rounds off the battle by repeatedly slamming his foe into handy nearby mountains. Ouch.\nLost Warrior is, officially, the final character to join the DNF Duel launch roster, which now totals 16 distinct and unique fighters. I'm still pretty much at a loss for who I'm gonna be digging into, but Enchantress and Inquisitor are both pretty solid calls for me. I hope to share my findings on Nexon's underdog fighter with you all soon. In the meantime, maybe check out the previous trailers for Berserker, Grappler, Hitman, Inquisitor, Striker, Ranger, Dragon Knight, Vanguard, Kunoichi, Crusader, Ghostblade, Launcher, Troubleshooter, Swift Master, and Enchantress.\nDNF Duel launches on PlayStation and PC platforms June 28.\nThe post DNF Duel is STILL revealing new characters, here is the Lost Warrior appeared first on Destructoid.",

Old pop culture collectibles have become priceless artifacts in this world, so the goal is to plunder more memorabilia than the other crews and get them out.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0694XcFmI7M\nIt looks like Hyenas is really leaning into the pop culture and \"irreverent\" tone, as creative director Charlie Bewsher describes in a post-premiere interview. Zero-G movement and combat also look to play a factor. Each playable Hyena also has unique abilities, to cater to whatever playstyle you'd want.\nScraps of nostalgia\nHyenas really looks to be another entry in the Tarkov-influenced extraction shooter genre. We've seen plenty of these, from Rainbow Six Extraction to Battlefield 2042's Hazard Zone.\nWhat seems to be setting Hyenas apart is the tone itself. It's taking a bright and brazen approach that feels right in line with the likes of Borderlands. That, plus hoards full of nostalgic loot and references, like the Nixon mask and a Rubik's Cube.\nCreative Assembly has made some stellar games, including Alien: Isolation and the Total War games, but I can't really say I'm sold on Hyenas just yet. It will have a chance to prove itself ahead of its 2023 launch though. Sign-ups for the Alpha Test are live right now over on the game's website.\nOtherwise, Hyenas is aiming to launch in 2023 for PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, and PS5.\nThe post Hyenas is Sega’s new pop culture-infused sci-fi FPS appeared first on Destructoid.",

(A demo is already available on PlayStation platforms.)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ7XL0ksQLY\nAs a quick refresher, Yurukill: The Calumniation Games is an unnerving new release that sees convicted felons forced to team up with their victims in order to survive a bizarre tournament of death — presided over by \"Binko,\" an attractive woman in a sinister fox mask. Yurukill hopes to marry the fast-paced, pulse-pounding action of a G.rev-developed shmup with the heavy social deduction drama of a Danganronpa, all bedecked in attractive anime artwork and, of course, starring a cast of ridiculously hot hipsters. The story has been written by Homura Kawamoto of Kakegurui fame, so expect plenty of high drama and state-smashing anarchy.\nThe Steam demo will offer players the first chapter of Yurukill in its entirety, which will certainly give you a taste of the title's mood, atmosphere, and genre-blending gameplay. I've been hugely intrigued by this title ever since its initial announcement, so I'm definitely hoping to get to this demo later today to check out the action for myself. Oh, and should you pull the trigger on a full purchase, then your demo save data will be carried over into the main release.\nYurukill: The Calumniation Games launches in North America, July 5, on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post You can now check out Yurukill: The Calumniation Games on PC via Steam demo appeared first on Destructoid.",

It is likely that PlayStation is happy with the news and updates offered on its upcoming titles during the recent Sony State of Play and Summer Game Fest presentations.\nThis year sees Gamescom return in a physical capacity for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic forced restrictions on global travel and social gatherings. Gamescom 2022 has been described as a \"hybrid\" event by organizers, and will feature a host of online streams and activities in addition to its live show — which is once again being held in Cologne's Koelnmesse center. Gamescom, as always, will kick off with a special Opening Night Live stream, hosted by Geoff Keighley.\nGamescom 2022 will take place from August 24-28.

          "description": "Big enough for the whole Bat Family\nWB Montreal's Gotham Knights is sounding like a pretty big game. Or at least big in square mileage, when it comes to the city of Gotham.\nIn an interview with Game Informer, Gotham Knights game director Geoff Ellenor emphasizes the Batcycle's usefulness for getting around Gotham.\n\"It's pretty big. I haven’t put one map over the other, but our Gotham is a big place. I tend to spend a lot of my Zoom calls on the Batcyle driving around Gotham. It is one of the fastest and most chill ways to move around the city. It feels like a big place.\"\nGotham Knights executive producer Fleur Marty follows it up with a more direct comparison to how big this portrayal of Batman's home will be.\n\"For sure it’s the biggest version of Gotham that has been represented in video games,\" said Fleur. \"The most important thing for us is its density and verticality. It has a lot of layers. The Batcycle is the long-range mode of transportation.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFtYcS3DPfM\nKnight court\nThat's a big Gotham then, if we're comparing it to the likes of Arkham Knight. Good to know the Batfamily may have lost Bruce but kept some wheels around.\nAs for other tidbits from Game Informer's coverage, the pair also addresses what happens when two players pick the same character. It sounds like it's not only possible, but has some funny ramifications.\n\"We’re leaving it up to players.,\" said Fleur. \"We know some people will want to have different characters, but some won’t care. I don’t want to spoil anything, but there’s a funny moment in the game if you are playing as two of the same character.\"\nI'm hoping for a \"two Robins walk into a bar\" joke somewhere. Gotham Knights is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on Oct. 25, 2022.\nThe post Gotham Knights will have ‘biggest’ Gotham in a video game thus far appeared first on Destructoid.",

Four more characters from the manga and anime series are dropping into Fortnite's Item Shop on June 23, this Thursday.\nThe four candidates chosen this time around are some recognizable faces, even if you're not too familiar with Naruto. Itachi Uchiha and Orochimaru bring some menacing presence to the field, while Gaara is the rival-turned-ally of the group. Also joining the crew is Hinata, a Hyuga clan Shinobi who grows close to the cast, especially Naruto.\nAdd these to the already added Naruto characters in Fortnite, like Sasuke and the titular shinobi, and you've got a lot of options for fans of the ninja-themed series.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np7xNgjFqdw\nAlongside the skins themselves, there are also a bunch of backpacks, gliders, and emotes to pick up as part of this \"Rivals\" drop. There are bundles too, packing together some of the characters, cosmetics, and some loading screens as well. You can find the full rundown here.\nReturn to the village\nAdditionally, from 8 p.m. ET on June 23 to 8 p.m. ET on July 7, the gates to the Hidden Leaf Village Map will open up again. The adventure area has plenty of locations to explore, as well as quests to complete and unlock more areas. Nindo Community Challenges are also back, oepning up today to earn some cosmetic rewards.\nNow, I'm not the biggest Naruto fan, so these admittedly do little for me.

To celebrate two decades of dystopian sci-fi action, publisher Bandai Namco has announced several different endeavors that will look back at the video games, manga, anime, and novels set within CyberConnect2's new millennium.\nThe original run of the .hack manga has been digitally republished and is available for Japanese fans to purchase between now and July 4 directly from the CyberConnect2 website. In addition, a special anniversary book will launch on July 19, looking back at every release in the series — from the original  2002 PS2 release .hack//Infection through collectible card title .hack//Enemy. Unfortunately, Bandai Namco did not announce any plans to localize these re-releases for western fans.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ulUhubUdYc\nA special exhibition will also be installed at Yurakucho Marui in Chiyoda, Tokyo between the dates of August 9 and August 28, 2022. The installation will feature original concept artwork and other audio/visual elements celebrating the multimedia franchise. In December, a second commemorative anniversary book will also be released, alongside a special three-CD set of .hack's evocative and melodramatic score.\nBut what in the way of new games? Well, Bandai Namco has not offered any such reveal, or even the announcement of a reveal, but mystery still surrounds the \"Last Recollection\" trademark, which the publisher filed back in April of this year. It is believed that this pertains to an as-yet-unannounced set of the four mainline titles in the .hack franchise, namely .hack//Infection, .hack//Mutation, .hack//Outbreak, and finally .hack//Quarantine. So just sit tight for new news, hack squad.\nThe post Bandai Namco celebrates .hack 20th anniversary with retrospective video appeared first on Destructoid.",

I know I am, just for the roster at the very least. The publisher has chosen to stoke the hype fire one last time by releasing the game's opening cinematic.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruRh8RGLRVM\nOriginally announced in 2019, (and widely covered by yer boy since), DNF Duel is a one-on-one fighter adapted from the popular Korean MMO Dungeon Fighter Online. DNF Duel repurposes an arsenal of DFO classes as individual roster members, including Fighter, Grappler, Inquisitor, Dragon Knight, Kunoichi, and many others. With gameplay designed by Guilty Gear's Arc System Works, and some very impressive visuals, DNF Duel is looking to make an impact in the coming FGC summer season.\nDNF Duel will feature rollback netcode on PS4 and PC, though will sadly not support crossplay, at least not at launch. In addition to online battles, the fighter will include a single-player story mode, training facilities, survival mode, a gallery, and more. There is no denying that it is an unknown IP in the fighting game world, and is up against stiff competition from current and upcoming games. But it looks like Nexon's underdog hopes to come out swingin' and carve a niche all of its very own.\nDNF Duel will launch on PlayStation and PC platforms June 28. Be sure to check out the dynamic character trailers for Berserker, Grappler, Hitman, Inquisitor, Striker, Ranger, Dragon Knight, Vanguard, Kunoichi, Crusader, Ghostblade, Launcher, Troubleshooter, Swift Master, and Enchantress.\nThe post DNF Duel previews opening cinematic one week from launch appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Free For All season is live now, and Fall Guys is officially launched for Nintendo Switch and Xbox consoles.\nNews of this update arrived last month, revealing Mediatonic's gameshow-style competition is coming to new platforms. With today's update, Fall Guys is now free to play on all platforms. It also has cross-play across all platforms, so the party doesn't stop when you swap over. Mediatonic also confirms in an FAQ that the new season makes Fall Guys cross-progression as well.\nhttps://twitter.com/FallGuysGame/status/1539235705460776962\nToday's update also marks the launch of the new Season Pass. Everyone gets access to 50 levels, while legacy players—those who bought Fall Guys when it first launched—get the whole thing free.\nGrab a hold of the ledge\nSome more updates are in store for Fall Guys today as well. Alongside the new cosmetics in the Season Pass, some new courses are being added. Hex-A-Ring, Volleyfall, Speed Circuit, Track Attack, Bounce Party, The Swiveller, and Blast Ball are all added in to the game.\nAn Auto Grab option is also available, letting players automatically grab ledges. You can also now dive-grab Tails and Crowns, which is sure to make some of those protect-your-tail rounds more interesting. Voice Chat is also enabled in Parties.\nOne note is that while Steam owners will continue to be able to play Fall Guys and get all the updates, the platformer royale won't have a Steam store page anymore. Any new players picking up Fall Guys on PC today will need to play through the Epic Games Store.\nWith all the new cosmetics and courses, as well as cross-platform play, it really does seem like a good summer to get back into Fall Guys.

          "description": "It's out on Steam on June 23\nA Tiny Tina's Wonderlands Steam release is imminent as Gearbox has just revealed that the game is coming to the platform on June 23. That's this week!\nOriginally released on March 25, 2022, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands came out on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and...PC, but only on the Epic Games Store. While many games have longer exclusivity windows, Wonderlands will hit Steam in less than three months, which isn't bad in the grand scheme of things. Gearbox has announced that the exact release time for Wonderlands Steam is actually 10AM PT on June 23. It'll debut with a standard edition for $60, or the special [Chaotic Great] edition for $79.99 (which includes the season pass) — if you buy in on Steam through July 7, 2022, you'll get the golden hero armor pack.\nSo, a few quick things about the Wonderlands Steam edition. Gearbox says that save data can be transferred between Steam and Epic, \"but will need to be moved manually.\" Annoyingly, the publisher says that \"players run the risk of potentially losing save files,\" and suggests that users \"make a backup copy.\" This kind of goes without saying, but it's good to reiterate every now and then. The Steam version will also support cross-play, and will not be left out of that party. Oh, and the Molten Mirrors DLC is out this week, which will be live alongside of the Steam edition. It's the third (of four) \"Mirrors of Mystery\" DLC packs, which comprise the season pass.\nYou can find the Steam page for the game here. Again, it'll be live on June 23 at 10AM PT.\nThe post Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands only took three months to come to Steam, no longer an Epic exclusive appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It supports up to 10 players\nModder CraftyBoss managed to do something that probably should have been done a long time ago: a Super Mario Odyssey multiplayer mod.\nHoused on their Discord server, the mod (which requires a modded Switch) allows up to 10 people to play Mario Odyssey together, with different costumes to differentiate everyone: that actually sync while playing. The mod itself is a work in progress, as is the custom game mode concept, but for now, the basics seem to be working.\nInterestingly, moon collection (collectibles that dictate game progress) \"is shared between all players.\" Meaning, you could have an entire crew jump into a level, and either play it separately to divide and conquer, or hang out together and go for the same objective. It reminds me of Castlevania: Harmony of Despair's core gimmick (man that game needs to come back on modern platforms!).\nWhile Mario Odyssey felt more than complete on its own, something like this, even if it was just a few players at a time, gives it new life. \"What if [X] had multiplayer\" is something people have been pondering for decades in the realm of gaming, and mods have typically been the way to deliver on that dream.\nSuper Mario Odyssey multiplayer trailer:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXxnhvP_LEI\nThe post Someone made a Super Mario Odyssey multiplayer mod appeared first on Destructoid.",

It first established its headquarters in Sunnyvale, California, neighbor to a host of now-famous tech startups. The new logo, a callback to the retro design of the old location, features the company’s classic branding alongside a semi-transparent “50.” Atari is calling the limited-time celebration logo “Borregas” after the street where you could find the headquarters. According to the company, this design will join with the previously revealed “Sunnyvale” anniversary logo in gracing the many upcoming corporate announcements, game reveals, partnerships, and merchandising collaborations.\n “Design innovation was a fundamental driver and differentiator for Atari during the golden age of video games,” said Wade Rosen, CEO of Atari. “Every artist, designer, and engineer challenged themselves to reach creative excellence; it is a hallmark of Atari that persists to this day.”\nIn the midst of the logo’s reveal, it also looks like an Atari classic is getting a revival. According to Gamerbraves, a follow-up to Yar’s Revenge is in the works. The information comes straight from Howard Scott Warshaw, who worked at Atari in the ‘80s and created the title for the Atari 2600. The interview contained few concrete details on the project, just that it seems the sequel has been greenlit. Hopefully, we will hear more about the game as development continues.",

The title is described as a multiplayer, multi-team heist experience set in space with a punky comic book aesthetic. What this means practically is players can jump into five teams of three to battle each other over a prize and \"engage, evade, exploit, and steal their way to victory.\" The game's debut trailer shows off some fast-pasted action, but to see everything for yourself, you can check out the trailer below.\n\n\nThe story envisions a world in which the billionaires have finally made it to mars, destroying Earth in the process. However, the rich get nostalgic for their former planet's culture. So, they send out ships to collect plunder from the remnants of Earth's poor survivors. Not content to take this sitting down, the Hyenas are fighting back.\nThe game is still in early development, so the creators have not revealed the release date, but we do know the game is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Though it's still a ways off, you can sign up for Hyenas' alpha today, and you can learn much more about the title in IGN's Summer of Gaming interview-filled stream.",

You'll be able to play it on June 23.\nTwo different editions will be available – the Standard and, as Gearbox calls it, \"Chaotic Great Edition.\" The latter includes the game's season pass and the Dragon Lord Pack Bonus Content, which, among other things, adds cosmetic content. The fancy edition also comes with (sigh) the Butt Stallion cosmetic pack and the four Mirrors of Mystery DLCs. The editions are available for $59.99 and $79.99 USD, respectively. \nAcross all platforms, the Molten Mirrors (the third of the Mirrors of Mystery DLC) is also being released on June 23. As detailed by Gearbox: \nThe last Mirrors of Mystery DLC is expected to be released later this year for owners of the Season Pass or Chaotic Great Edition. It will add a new playable class. \"This shamanic elementalist channels spirits and summons storms to wear down foes with poison and elemental damage,\" Gearbox said in a press release.\nAccording to our reviewer, Tiny Tina's Wonderland is really good. As we said, it's \"upbeat and fun from start to finish, offering a rewarding adventure filled with goofy characters, imaginative bosses, and a great sense of ownership over your character through it all.\"",

          "description": "The new and improved PlayStation Plus is live and surprisingly great. \nOf course, it has all the titles you might expect: God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, and a bunch of other triple-A games. Whatever. But there's more to it than PlayStation's ever-growing list of really expensive games.\nI had little-to-no interest in the new PlayStation Plus when it was announced. But when Sony gave me three free months – the perks of being in the press, I guess, but also something I should disclose given the glowing nature of this piece – I took the time to scroll through the games list. \nTo my delight, it's full of weirdo games you probably haven't heard of and definitely have not played. Immediately, I downloaded nearly a dozen games based solely on the criteria of \"Does this look weird and/or interesting?\" It's been a blast. \nI finally played through the Gravity Rush series, and while I think Gravity Rush 2 is disappointing, the original is fantastic. I highly recommend checking it out. It takes about seven hours to mainline and consistently keeps mission design interesting. It's also a ton of fun throwing yourself around its dizzying open world. \nI also played Mitsurugi Kamui hikae. It's an objectively bad game but I can't help but love it. You play as a girl with a big sword, going after your friend who is also a girl with a big sword – but she's evil. You load into bland combat arenas that look ripped straight out of a PlayStation 2 game and fight enemies that all look the same. Again, it's bad. But charmingly, in a way I appreciate. I played for an hour and loved every second.\nNext up are Disaster Report 4, Tokyo Jungle, and the Siren series. I can't wait. But I want to know, what hidden gems have you found on PlayStation Plus? Keep it weird, unique, and interesting. If you're finally checking out Red Dead Redemption II, keep it to yourself. We all know that's a great game. Drop down to the comments and let me know what weirdo games I should play next!",

          "description": "The Callisto Protocol captured the attention of horror fans worldwide with its terrifying world and oppressive sense of horror, but how does it feel to play it? In this exclusive Game Informer interview, Ben Walker, design director at Striking Distance Studios, breaks down how combat, dodging, and the bounty of gameplay systems work.\n\n\nJoin Alex Stadnik and Marcus Stewart as they grill Ben on all things Callisto gameplay. The trio kicks off the conversation by dissecting the basics of combat. In Callisto, players balance melee and ranged encounters to keep protagonist Jacob alive as he fights through Saturn's dead moon. At your side is your trusty shiv, a shock baton, and a wide swath of weapons to fend off the Biophage and figure out what's happening on the moon.\nWhile that may seem like a pretty standard setup, the key is how players balance their approach to enemy encounters. Callisto is not a game that will overpower players. Jacob has limited ammo and health and can't go in guns blazing if he hopes to survive. Those who delve into the fray will also have to utilize the new dodging system Striking Distance emphasizes as a massive part of combat. Instead of a simple button press, you'll have to use the left stick to dodge either left or right at the precise moment. Blocking works too, but it will always cost you a bit of health. Callisto has a lot going on moment to moment, but Striking Distance hopes this dance leads to a thrilling moment-to-moment experience.\nIf that's not enough, we also discuss how the team utilizes the PlayStation 5 controller to up the immersion, upgrade trees, and much more.\nIf you want to learn more about The Callisto Protocol, be sure to head over to our exclusive cover hub below, where you'll find our preview impressions, the GI cover reveal, and more looks at the game in the upcoming days.

          "description": "Remakes of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4 were planned at some point until publisher Activision pulled the plug. This news comes from Tony Hawk himself, who discussed the series with streamer andyTHPS. \nAccording to Hawk, the \"plan\" was to develop remakes for THPS 3 and 4 following the release of the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 remake. That plan, however, got complicated after Activision merged THPS1 and 2 developer Vicarious Visions into Blizzard. \n\"The truth of it is that they were trying to find someone to do [Tony Hawk's Pro Skater] 3 and 4, but they just didn't really trust anyone the way they did Vicarious, so they took other pitches from other studios,\" Hawk says in the clip. \"Like, 'What would you do with a THPS title?' And they didn't like anything they heard, and then that was it.\"\nYou can watch the full clip below: \nTony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 remasters were in the works but they were scrapped after Vicarious Visions was merged into Blizzard. 😔\nhttps://t.co/84rlYDgvUQ pic.twitter.com/oWR70xTOYv\nJune 20, 2022\nAt the very least, it doesn't sound like THPS3 and 4 was actively in development. As Hawk says in the clip, it was planned, but he never indicates it was in production. More curious is Activision's interest in taking the series in new directions. Historically, that's been a bad idea.  \nThe news is particularly painful because, after a drought of skateboarding games, the excellent Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 seemed to indicate the king of action sports was back. As we said in our review,  \"the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater franchise may once again have a bright future thanks to this terrific blast from the past.\" Alas, history proves otherwise. \nBut actually, skateboarding games have had a renaissance in recent years. Of course, there's Vicarious Visions' Tony Hawk's Pro Skater reboot. There's also OlliOlli World, Skate City, Session, and Skater XL.",

In a new update to the battle royale game, the Sith Lord is unleashed and he won't hesitate to take you down, but if you can take him out first, you'll get his lightsaber as a reward.\nVader appears in random places each match but is easy to locate since he arrives at the island at the same time as the players. When you are in the Battle Bus, look for an Imperial Shuttle. It'll enter the airspace just above the clouds and will quickly descend to a spot on the map. The Shuttle is highlighted with a blue glow for a few seconds after settling down on the surface.\nVader is one of the toughest bosses in the game and will take some serious firepower to take out. He's also flanked by two stormtroopers. He uses the Force in a variety of ways to mess with you and can block your shots. Your best bet is to attack him from afar with a sniper rifle or approach in a group. \nHis lightsaber is a game-changer. You too can block shots with it, and it can also be thrown a decent distance to inflict big damage. Of course, you can swing it widely for melee strikes. We don't know how long Vader will be around or how he is influencing the story, but it's awesome to see him on the island dishing out punishment. Here's hoping more Star Wars integration is on the way soon!",

If a studio wants to take a new crack at an old game, especially if it’s the studio behind the original release, why not?

If you’ve kept up with Evil West, then you likely already know its combat resembles that of 2018’s God of War, with the added bonus of guns. It’s just as brutal, with even more exploding gore. This trailer showcases a lot more of that and the wide variation of biomes we’ll be visiting, too, from western frontiers to strange caverns to foggy forests and more. \nCheck it out for yourself below: \n\nAs you can see, Evil West is looking like a fun time, and I can’t wait to check it out. If you’re unfamiliar with its premise, Flying Wild Hog describes it as “a third-person action game that puts you in the boots of a vampire hunter rescuing a Wild West devoured by darkness.” Flying Wild Hog will release Evil West on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on Sept. 20. \nFor more, watch its debut trailer and then check out this gameplay showing from last December. After that, check out this vampire-infested release date trailer for Evil West. \nAre you excited to check out Evil West this September? Let us know in the comments below!",

This news comes from Eurogamer, which discovered Reddit user Magister Organi, a student studying Latin, and their diligent attempted translation of the songs of Elden Ring. Organi confirmed that most of the lyrics are gibberish, and they even apparently reached out to an Elden Ring music producer to verify their findings.\n\n\n“I am a Latin student, and I have been studying all Elden Ring choral songs,” Organi writes on the PlayStation 5 subreddit. “The fir…",

Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise. This week we go all the way to hell with Dante as we unpack the mysterious low-point in the series, Devil May Cry 2.\nReleasing a short 15 months after the release of Devil May Cry, Dante returns with a 2-disc adventure that’s more often than not seen as the worst game in the series, and there are very good reasons as to why it turned out that way. In this episode of Video Gameography, we talk about the tumultuous development cycle that didn’t include the team behind DMC, Team Little Devils. From an unknown first director to arcade-focused developers making their first console game and a late transition of direction, Devil May Cry 2 has all of the trappings of a project that would have been canceled. That is, if not for the man who would shepherd the series for years to come. \nJoin hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), along with Game Informer Editor-In-Chief Andrew Reiner (@Andrew_Reiner) \nIf you’d like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

          "description": "Nerf, the leading foam dart and water weapon manufacturer, has unveiled its first-ever mascot, which fittingly goes by the name Murph. Murph Nerfington (I gave them the last name) will represent the company as part of a multi-year marketing push in social media, public events, and more.\nMurph looks like a Koosh mascot more than a Nerf representative, although that would still be under the Hasbro umbrella. However, if you look closely, you can see Murph is made entirely out of foam Nerf darts. The new character was created in association with a new summer initiative for the company to invite families to get out and play. Also, given the language of they/them pronouns in the mascot's announcement, Murph doesn’t have a set gender. So happy Pride month, Murph! The company even has a new mnemonic that Murph embodies, “Unleash the play in you.” I’m not sure what hard-to-remember topic this mnemonic is supposed to remind us of, but it’s a cute enough slogan nonetheless.\nBelow are a handful of promotional images of Murph handing some new Nerf weapons and looking like a late 2000s physics tech demo. \n\nIn a press release shared with Game Informer, here’s what Adam Kleinman, senior vice president and general manager of Nerf, has to say to welcome Murph into existence: \n“The launch of Murph is a testament to the success of Hasbro’s Brand Blueprint strategy and turning Nerf into the social, active play brand it is seen as today. We are thrilled to introduce Murph to fans, a mascot that represents the playful spirit that lives inside us all and is unleashed through Nerf.”\nIf you see Murph around this summer, make sure to give them a nice cold spray from your Nerf Super Soaker. You'd be doing them a favor; it has to be hotter than hell in that suit.\nWhere on the mascot family tree do you think Murph belongs? Is it on the branch with Gritty, or maybe with AM/PM's Toomgis? How about with the McDonald's Fry Kids? Let us know in the comments!",

A follow-up story would, presumably, center on Jon’s new life with the Wildlings. \nAnother Game of Thrones spin-off, the prequel show House of the Dragon, is set to premiere on HBO Max on August 21. That series focuses on House Targaryen 200 years before the original show. It's far from the only TV show in the pipeline based on George R.R. Martin's best-selling series. Other adjacent projects, such as 10,000 Ships, The Golden Empire, 9 Voyages, and Dunk and Egg, are in various stages of development. \n[Source: The Hollywood Reporter]",

Dragon's Dogma 2 is officially in the works and is set to land in 2023.\n\n\nThe announcement came as part of a video presentation commemorating the decade that's passed since Dragon's Dogma first arrived on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Hideaki Itsuno, the game's director, and key dev team members, Daigo Ikeno and Kenichi Suzuki, announced the game by unzipping their hoodies triumphantly at the end of the presentation, revealing the name \"Dragon's Dogma II,\" which was followed by a short animation of the official logo treatment to close out the video.\nBefore the big announcement, Itsuno introduced a look back at the development of Dragon's Dogma. It's a fascinating look at the director and his inspirations in fighting games like Street Fighter and melding that kind of flexible combat system with an expansive RPG story and gameplay. He also goes into the creation of the pawn system and wanting to make a single-player RPG that felt like playing with your friends online. The presentation is worth a watch for this mini-documentary alone.\nThere's no date for Dragon's Dogma 2, or any footage of the game yet, but having it in development is a huge step forward for the series after all this time. Capcom has confirmed the game is being built using the company's RE Engine, which powers games like Resident Evil Village, Monster Hunter Rise, and the upcoming Street Fighter 6.\nWhat do you want to see from the newly-announced Dragon's Dogma sequel?

Tribute Games and Dotemu’s throwback to the classic TMNT brawlers is out today, and a group of Game Informer editors will tackle the game live on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central.\nShredder’s Revenge is a new adventure inspired by the 1987 TMNT cartoon. Up to six players team up to battle over a dozen stages to fold Shredder’s evil schemes. If you’re a fan of brawlers, Shedder’s Revenge hits all the right notes. In my 8.75 out of 10 review, which you can read here, I described the game as a “polished, raucously fun throwback that plays better than how I remember the original games.”\nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes. You’ll also be granted entry to the official Game Informer Discord channel, where our welcoming community members, moderators, and staff gather to talk games, entertainment, food, and organize hangouts!",

Events like Steam's Next Fest even let us get our hands on playable slices to better understand what these games are and how they play. Starting next week, Xbox will again be offering playable demos for indie titles in a week-long event that console players can dive into and experience the near future for indie gaming.\nThe ID@Xbox Summer Game Fest Demo Event will run from June 21 through June 27 and includes over 30 game demos for gamers to try out. In the blog post announcing the event, Xbox reminds readers that these are the equivalent of \"show floor\" demos and are a work in progress. Each of the participating demos will only be available during the days of the demo event and will be taken down after. Because these games aren't complete yet, the blog also asks players to share their feedback with developers to help make the best game possible.\nXbox isn't ready to share the full list of games for the event yet but did provide four titles that will be included.\nBatora: Lost Haven\nBroken Pieces\nSevered Steel\nTinykin\nSome of these game demos are available through Steam Next Fest (or are out on PC already), so if you have a capable PC and can't wait until next week, you can take a peek at these games early.",
