          "description": "Free from Vita jail.\nLike Nintendo’s own Wii U, the PS Vita has seen a good chunk of its best games migrate to alternative platforms in the years since the system itself veered into the realm of ‘commercial failure’. One of those games is Freedom Wars, a third-person action title created by Dimps that, at the time, was one of the most successful first-party-published Vita games (in Japan, at least). Now, over 10 years later, publisher Bandai Namco has taken the reins to present a remaster for Switch, retaining much of the original’s essence while improving upon the core gameplay.\nFreedom Wars Remastered is, at its core, a loose take on Monster Hunter’s gameplay. As a Sinner within an underground Panopticon city, you must complete combat ops. Y’see, in a world in which resources are exceptionally scarce, the very nature of existence is in itself a crime; hence, you begin the game with a rather harsh one million-year sentence. By completing operations and rescuing your fellow citizens from large creatures known as Abductors, you can reduce your sentence and gain entitlements along the way.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "The long-awaited remaster of the remake.\nWay back in 1989, Nihon Falcom released Ys III: Wanderers from Ys for various PC-based platforms and eventually consoles like the Genesis and SNES. This 2D side-scroller was well-respected in the community and eventually acted as the basis for 2005's 3D reimagining, Ys: The Oath in Felghana, though this didn’t receive a Western release until a PSP version in 2010. Now, hot off the recent Western release of Ys X: Nordics, Falcom brings this remake to modern platforms as Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana. Sporting a few quality-of-life updates, this throwback to simpler times (which debuted in Japan back in September 2023) offers up an enjoyable and tightly designed action-RPG experience that you shouldn't miss out on.\nYs Memoire: The Oath in Felghana covers one of the earlier adventures of series star Adol Christin, following a journey to longtime companion Dogi's homeland of Felghana. They arrive and are warmly welcomed by Dogi’s friends and family, but it doesn’t take long for Adol to get caught up in a larger struggle. The king of Felghana seeks to claim a series of statues to loosen the seal placed upon a demon he wishes to release. Adol thus sets out to retrieve these statues before the king can, hoping to stop his nefarious plan.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Coming soon to press that advantage are the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D, a pair of even higher-spec processors that headlined AMD’s plethora of CES 2025 hardware announcements.\nNo pricing (or exact release date) on these yet, but they both up the core and thread counts over the 9800X3D while peaking at higher boost clock speeds. And, of course, they share the same 3D V-Cache design that makes the 9800X3D such a superlative CPU in the first place. If you don’t know what this is and how it helps game performance, imagine how much faster you could eat Wotsits if you had a massive bucket of them on your desk at all times, instead of having to get up and walk to the kitchen to grab individual packs. In this case the Wotsits are data, the bucket is 3D V-Cache, and the hastened ruination of your digestive system is games running faster.\nRead more",

The list in question is part of a strategy of counteracting what the US sees as the close relationship between China's armed forces and various civilian technology suppliers and research projects.\nAt the time of publication yesterday, a Tencent spokesperson had commented that the listing was based on a \"misunderstanding\". In a statement sent to RPS overnight and also published online, Tencent's chairman Ma Huateng and executive board have now said that they're prepared to get legal if the misunderstanding isn't resolved.\n Read more",

I think/hope it still exists somewhere in the apparatus of Green Man Gaming, hidden beneath the retailer's veneer of respectability like a barrel of radioactive waste. The other boob article was a piece for OXM about Ken Levine saying that he wished people would stop fixating on Elizabeth's cleavage in Bioshock Infinite - a complaint we might consider slightly hypocritical, given the character's visual design.\nNow it's time for boob article number 3: some modder has given 122 of the 150 Jokers in cardgame Balatro big chests.

Then, on New Year’s Day, that number jumped to 11,900 players on Steam - its second highest concurrent besides launch. Soon after, they vanished. Who were these mysterious shufflers, flocking to the deserted, echoing halls of Valve’s disastrous flop like your mate who uses the word ‘liminal’ too much to a dead shopping center? Forbes, who first reported on the phenomena, don’t know. No one knows. Somebody might actually know but writing ‘no one knows’ makes it more dramatic. Let’s dig in.\nRead more",

          "description": "As New Year's Day dawns, the bells ring out from the steeples of old London town. The peals of celebration travel outward through our atmosphere, exiting the realm of Earthly sound and resonating with interstellar plasma and detritus to form a delicate ripple of comet flakes and stray photons, expanding far beyond our solar system. Where the ripple encounters larger masses, such as planets, suns and... other things, it rebounds, riding the weft of stardust back down to Earth. As it returns home, the signal is modified. Tinkered with. It acquires unsettling harmonics and a guttural undertow. By the time it re-enters our atmosphere, it has condensed to three words, which descend and shrink and spiral into your ear like an octopus entering a crevice: FEED THE MAW.\r\n \nRead more",

As a concept, at least, SpaceCraft seems both flavourless and oddly inclined to overplay its own familiarity. I mean, look at that title. Consider its chilly blend of functionality and punmanship. Look at that capital \"C\", poking out of the middle like the bow on a present whose silhouette leaves nothing to the imagination. You already know broadly what this game involves, yes? Indeed, you do: it's a game about crafting spacecraft, so that you can travel to other planets and craft their resources into other, better spacecraft. This you may do eternally, for there are thousands of planets in store.\r\n \nRead more",

Since then, my experience of the character has been one long litany of Gar-memes and in particular, Gorefield memes. For those blissfully unaware, Gorefield is a version of Jim Davis’s otiose, lasagna-loving housecat who has broken his comic strip shackles and become a cosmic abomination. Gorefield's manifestations are many: centipede Gorefields, arachnid Gorefields, Gorefields that extend serpentine necks of unfleshed bone towards a cowering Jon Arbuckle, demanding to be fed in a voice that sounds nothing like Bill Murray, a voice as deep and velvety as the eternal Monday before the Big Bang.\nIn Gar-Type, a free Gorefield fangame from Youtuber and pixel artist LumpyTouch, Garfield has become a planet. The good news is that, unlike many other Gore-variants, this Gorefield is vulnerable to bullets. It falls to ace pilot Jon Starbuckle and his prototype starfighter, Gar-Type D, to save the Earth from lasagnnihilation.\n Read more",

          "description": "Unlike a lot of the team I'd imagine, my opinion is this: I thought the year was quite middling for games. Or at least, it was middling for my own personal taste, which is quite unsavoury at the best of times. Most of my best picks made it into the calendar proper, but a couple didn't. One I hadn't even played properly until after the vote, and the other? The other is a flawed pick, but one that I couldn't stop thinking about.\nAnyway, hope you all have a restful Xmas folks and a cracking new year. I hope Santa bought you some nice warm socks or a chocolate orange so dense, you could tee it off at your local golf club.\nRead more",

I want to park my soul in the head of a scared Scotsman way out of his depth, hundreds of miles from shore.

          "description": "My selection box isn't really a selection box. It's a tray of barely-nibbled leftovers, hastily lifted from my Steam backlog. One of the disadvantages of being news editor, you see, is that I have  developed a goldfish-grade attention span. In my hectic pursuit of the next scoop, or the next Elden Ring update changelog, I snatch and cast aside game demos like a pickpocket speedrunning the checkout line at Harvey Nichols. I'm dimly aware that some of these cast-aside games are Very Good. A few might even deserve to be played for longer than 30 minutes. I feel immensely guilty about that. Perhaps a little... existential, too. I have measured out my life in tutorial levels. \r\n\n\r\nSo! Rather than digging out three of the games I've actually completed this year, such as The Crush House, Death Of A Wish and Mask Quest, I'm going to gamble on recommending a few I've barely scratched, but which sure feel excellent and have attracted a positive critical consensus. If I am false in this assessment, may Horace the Endless Bear bite my head off for my impudence. Let's begin.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Between rising desktop component prices and ever-ballooning electricity bills, it would make sense that a smaller, cheaper system would take on a new appeal, and the success of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally show that convenience still trumps out-and-out performance for a lot of PC players.

My weakest skeletons, sensing their death coming, explode into fire and shards. My strongest skeletons fight so hard and with such alacrity that upon dying, they drag their spirits together and keep fighting as ghosts for a while. Foul little bone scorpions skitter around on fans of legs made from human hands. Somewhere in the middle, almost invisible among the noise, is the character I am actually playing: Path of Exile 2’s mean-spirited, callous, and gleefully enjoyable Witch.\nThis is a review in progress. It has to be. Even in its incomplete early access period, Path of Exile 2 is a great sprawling mass of a game. Three meaty acts of a planned six act campaign are followed by a trickier return tour through them, before the absurd endgame kicks into gear and the real work begins. If I came to you having played everything on offer I would be wild-haired, bloodshot-eyed and possessing perfect, incomprehensible knowledge. Let’s compromise: I have toured the dark caverns and the antediluvian crypts. I have been killed by various accumulated nasties. I’ve had a great time.\nRead more",

          "description": "The announcement of The Witcher 4 with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's Ciri as protagonist has attracted a bit of discussion. Some of the reaction is online toddlers waxing wroth about a video game having a (somewhat older!!!) woman as lead character, and especially, shock, a video game in a series that has hitherto starred a man. And some of it is people commenting more thoughtfully on whether Ciri genuinely makes for a suitable Witcher protagonist, given that she isn't the product of the typical Witcher genetic modification regime (which is heavily tailored towards men), and given that, without spoiling too much, she has gifts that make crumbly old Geralt's sword-and-sorcery skillset look rather paltry. \r\n\n\nSpeaking to Eurogamer this week, game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber responded to a few of these comments, and also shared a little about Ciri's situation at the start of the game.\r\n \nRead more",

After creating many characters, and dying and dying and dying again, I understand why it grips the brain with such fierce glee. It is a machine of grand imagination and adventuresome comedy.

          "description": "If you've been playing Assassin's Creed from day one onwards, you may recall just how enamored the community was with its parkour systems. These developed rather nicely up until Unity, only for subsequent RPG-like releases to downplay parkour as a whole. That's all changing in Assassin's Creed: Shadows, happily enough.\n\n\nAs someone who fell off the AC ride around the time of Unity's release, the fact that the franchise would de-emphasize arguably its most important gameplay system to the degree of Origins and Odyssey caught me off-guard. Ubisoft does appear to agree to some extent, because Assassin's Creed Shadows is adding complexity and manual movement control back into the mix. Ubisoft has recently published a blog discussing Shadows' parkour systems in great depth, and boy howdy will l…",

          "description": "Following up on the first round in October 2024, Capcom is getting ready for another Monster Hunter Wilds open beta test. This one officially kicks off on February 6 with content from the first test and a new hunting opportunity.\n\n\nThe meat of the new content is the ability to hunt Gypceros, a returning monster from the series. Features from the first test include Character Creation, Story Trial, and the Slay Doshaguma Quest. If you already made a character in the first test, fear not, because that data can be carried over to the second. It can also be carried over to the full game when it launches, but that doesn't apply to game progress.\n\n\nWatch as producer Ryozo Tsujimoto announces the test and schedule with his own eerily accurate custom character below.\n\n\n\n\nThere are two sessions planned, and you don't have to be subscribed to PlayStation Plus or Game Pass Core/Ultimate to try it out. Here's when you'll be able to play, complete with crossplay between the three platforms:\n\n\nMonster Hunter Wilds open beta 2 schedule \n\n\n\nStarts: Thursday, February 6, 2025 at 7:00 p.m. PT\n\n\nEnds: Sunday, February 9, 2025 at 6:59 p.m. PT\n\n\n\n\nStarts: Thursday, February 13, 2025 at 7:00 p.m. PT\n\n\nEnds:  Sunday, February 16, 2025 at 6:59 p.m. PT\n\n\n\nThere are also special bonuses in store for everyone who participates in the beta test. A decorative charm for your weapon or Seikret, as well as an item pack, can all be redeemed in the full game. \n\n\nAccording to Tsujimoto, they heard from a lot of players who either missed out on the first test or just want to play again. That prompted the planning for the upcoming test. He added that the team is still hard at work finishing the game, with adjustments and improvements underway that won't make it into the second beta in time. We'll see how those improvements stack up when Monster Hunter Wilds launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam on February 28.\n\nThe post Monster Hunter Wilds kicks off second open beta test on February 6 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Since you can't trade gold stickers outside of this event, it's a rare opportunity to get specific cards during brief 24-hour periods before being restricted to card pack opening again. \n\n\nIt's also rare for Golden Blitz events to repeat past cards, meaning you might miss out on one you need if you're not online during a specific time. Let's check out every past Golden Blitz sticker during the Monopoly Games season to determine whether you'll still get an opportunity to trade a particular card.\n\n\nUpdated January 7, 2024: Added information about the final Golden Blitz of the Jingle Joy season.\n\n\nAll past Golden Blitz stickers in Monopoly GO\n\n\nSince Monopoly GO's Jingle Joy Season began on December 5, 2024, we have …",

The games I got with it – games like Total Recall and Kid Icarus – had me convinced that I just hated games on the NES. It wasn’t until I was introduced to a couple of games on this list, that retro gaming truly opened up to me.\n\n\nI do believe that games age, but mostly on a technical level. Poor framerates and blurry graphics can make it difficult to return to an early 3D game. Their design, on the other hand, is rarely completely superseded. Video game development really just goes through trends. Right now, there’s a particular style of game that is favored by gamers, but this was different 10 years ago, which was different 10 yea…",

Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.
