          "description": "So, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, eh? I liked it a lot. 150 hours a lot. I big cried at least twice and welled up, much like a well, many other times. As much as I’d like to wax emotional about the plot and characters in an endless lifestream-of-consciousness ramble, articles need both headlines and subjects (truly an act of conspiratorial violence targeted at my personal dadaist instincts). So, let’s talk about just the minigames, because I think they’re wonderful for all sort of reasons that might not be immediately apparent.  Naturally, big spoiler potential ahead if, like me, you consider everything you haven’t experienced in the RPG game a spoiler.\nI think one of OG Final Fantasy’s 7 best tricks is how it doesn’t just dish out its strangest distractions as a palette cleanser to the main meal of its action and drama, but actively works them in as an indispensable part of the menu. It also does this all without a shred of shame or self-consciousness, resulting in a cinematic video game with no inner turmoil or resentment toward either part of that equation - a characteristic I feel is suffered from by many of the games for which FF7 lead the way. Take the Gold Saucer. It’s an excuse to dick around and ride motorbikes, sure, but it’s also an essential story beat while the party takes time to relax and enjoy each other’s company away from the stress of travel and battle.\n \nRead more",

I honestly lost track) for years, but it's now available in a bundle on Steam as part of whatever needlessly awkward thing EA are doing this month. There's suddenly an opportunity to get into why its design and atmosphere make it probably my favourite of the whole collection, and why I wish I could say that without adding that it indulges in a lot of boring early-00s racism.\nRead more",

There are feats of platforming prowess on show here that should really be experienced fresh and unsullied by rudimentary descriptions of them, because to say anymore would be to spoil the surprise. This feels doubly important when the game itself is so fleeting in length, its brief and dizzying journey through the dirt, magma, ice and marshy bogs of this strange, treasure-stuffed island coming to a swift conclusion in just over three and a half hours. It left me wanting more the moment the credits rolled, but deep down I know it's also perfectly formed just the way it is. Rather than outstay its welcome, Pepper Grinder shows up, performs its party trick, then gets the hell out of the way, leaving you to bask in the warm glow of a good game well done.\nRead more",

We at the RPS Electronic Wireless Show podcast think this is a good thing, in broad terms, and we discuss why (but also hope Joel is allowed holidays), as well as the response the community of players has had, which is also very interesting.

Void Sols, however, is an upcoming Soulslike that feels like it might be able to satisfy both sides of the 'git gud' camp, appealing to nervous dodge-rollers like myself while also giving hardened Elden Ringers a run for their money. It's all down to its plentiful supply of approachable customisation options, allowing you to ratchet up the difficulty if you're finding things a bit easy, or knock it down, reapply your stat points, and even create whole new loadouts - each with their own individual stat combinations - to win the day. It's all wonderfully considerate, and having played the free demo that's just launched on Steam, I'd strongly recommend giving it a go if you're feeling in need of a little training ahead of Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree coming out.\nRead more",

Darktide is hard when you start a new character, with weapons that barely scratch some foes and no talents to back them up. It's a challenge unlike the official high difficulty levels, which lean towards drowning you in special enemies. So after hitting level 30 on all four classes and grinding out great gear, I've started a new character who'll never learn skills or get a good gun.

This makes tweaks to things arising from 1.6 (many of them addressing moss, a new foraging item) and fixes bugs, one of which was causing 'excess trash' to be fished.\nImportantly, 1.6 added more pet animals to the game, and the mini-update has built in a case where if you don't have a pet by year two, for any reason, then you can adopt them from Marnie's.

Survival MMO Dune: Awakening threatens to bring that back in a big way: the novel and films on which it’s based take place, after all, on an entire planet made of sand. \r\n\n\r\nDevelopers Funcom have various plans for sprucing up the aesthetic, however. For one thing, parts of Awakening are set underground, where there’s actual, canonical vegetation and thus, a wider range of colours. For another, it’s possible Dune: Awakening will ultimately leave the dunes behind and whisk us away on a journey to another planet.\r\n \nRead more",

Geneforge 2 - Infestation is fresh from the rack, yet looks and functions like the CRPGs of the late 1990s. Where most isometric throwbacks these days offer a forced perspective over 3D scenes, Geneforge 2 is the real deal - its flat character sprites gliding across tiled backgrounds, with the elegant shuffle of Shōgun-era ladies-in-waiting.\nThis look is less a nostalgic affectation than it is simply practical. Geneforge 2, like all of Jeff Vogel’s games, was made in the spare bedroom of his Seattle home with the help of his wife, Mariann Krizsan - plus a handful of artists spread more broadly. It’s the latest in a long line of low-budget Spiderweb Software RPGs to achieve sprawling scale and reactivity by leaning on cost-effective and old-fashioned production values. Here there is no voice acting, nor any ambient noise that cannot be sourced from royalty-free soundbanks. In pastoral areas of the map, the impression of grazing livestock is conveyed entirely through a free sound effect called ‘Eating a rusk.wav’.\nRead more",

          "description": "Following up yesterday’s news on Ghost Story Games’ upcoming Judas, courtesy of the Ian Games Network, another interview with the Friends Per Second podcast, via SkillUp on YouTube, has shed light aplenty on the upcoming Bioshock-ian FPS game. The hosts played the game for 5 hours at Ghost Story Games in Boston, then interviewed director Ken Levine. Here’s a crunchy chipstick of a take to kick things off with; Judas is, says Ralph of SkillUp, “Definitely not Bioshock in space”. I...haven't played it, have I, so I'll put my cynicism in its horrible little cage for a bit. Aesthetically, at least, Judas does look to have a lot going for it.\nNot least because of the giant robot dog that takes on the role of Bioshock’s bathysphere this time around. Riding the dog sounds to involve a pixel art minigame that has you collect fuel pickups. You’ll ride the dog between the “districts” of the city-sized spaceship Mayflower. We also got a few details on what exactly those districts might entail. The hosts mention a  “birthing district” and “milk district”. Whatever you think the “milk district” might be in terms of a Bioshock-ian dystopia, it sounds like you’re probably right. The hosts made a face. I made a face. I’m sure you are also likely making a face right now. \n \nRead more",

          "description": "I find myself increasingly turned off these days by simulations that boast of endless butterfly effects. I guess my misgivings can be boiled down to \"a chain of dominoes is still a chain of dominoes even if it's 1000 metres in extent\". Without some reason to care supplied by a narrative or broader question of theming and aesthetics, it all risks being admirable of execution but also like sheer technical maximalism - systems for the sake of systems. What do I care if I can make the 567th domino fall over by kicking the first?\r\n\n\r\nStill, I'm very interested to see more of City 20. In development since 2018, it's the work of Untold Games, a studio hitherto known for VR projects, location-based \"immersive experiences\" and ports of games such as Journey To The Savage Planet. As a piece of mechanics, it's a top-down sandbox survival experience with a highly reactive environment and procedural storytelling, influenced by the likes of Rimworld (and not, the developers insist, created using latter-day generative AI tools). As a story scenario, meanwhile, it's inspired by Cold War conspiracy theories about Soviet \"secret cities\" given over to uranium enrichment and nuclear experiments. The titular City 20 is one such burg, though not a direct recreation. As the game begins, a nuclear accident has led to a radiation spike and a partial evacuation: you play one of the poor suckers who didn't make the last bus out of town.\r\n\n \nRead more",

We’ve finally got some more details about the extremely Bioshock-adjacent Judas, courtesy of the Ian Games Network, who spent six hours playing the game and chatting to Levine at Ghost Story Games in Boston. It’s a massive interview, but very broadly, it's an FPS game that gives you guns in your right hand and “various organic powers” in your left. It’s got a big focus on story and choosing your own path through character interaction, and it also has roguelike elements. “The ship is different every time you die and come back, the ship layout can be different,\" says Levine. \r\n\n\r\nJudas, it turns out, is the name of the woman you’ve likely already seen in the trailers, who is also your player character. The game takes place aboard the Mayflower, a spaceship the size of a city doing that thing from Hitchhiker’s Guide with the hairdressers, only the Earth seems to have been in actual danger this time. You start the game being resurrected, or “reprinted”. You’ll then start chatting to holographic projections of the three leaders of the ship; all of which have different goals, roles, and Bioshock-ian quirks. They’re at odds with each other, and you’ll get to decide who to work with and against, hence “Narrative Legos” and “No two playthroughs ever…” yadayada, which is a phrase that seems almost quaint in terms of comparative obnoxiousness. \r\n\n\n Read more",

Imagine my glee, then, when an early quest in action RPG Dragon's Dogma 2 not only condoned my weird hobby, but actively encouraged it.\nAlfred is bardic beggar you’ll likely first encounter by Vernworth’s city square water feature. He’s doing a spot of medieval busking, spinning some brilliantly localized rhyming yarns to whoever will listen. He also periodically asks for beer money, even if you think he’s shit, which is a great pitch. Onlookers come and go, but after listening to him gas up the nobility with tall tales for a spell, you’ll likely spot a particularly enthusiastic permanent fixture off to the side. Have a chat, and he’ll tell you he reckons there’s something fishy about Alfred. He never sees much patronage from busking, but he never seems short of coin. Follow him around for a bit and see how he makes his money, won’t you? My annoyance that I’d just given Alfred several hundred gold immediately dissipated at the prospect of some quest journal-sanctioned stalking.\n \nRead more",

You do have to look for it, mind you. The game's art direction at large is an elegant hodgepodge of inspirations that deserves to be unpicked carefully after release.\nMain character Nor Vanek - who is on a mission to massacre various escaped underworld gods - is kind of a Napoleonic superhero. Rakishly attired in braided frock coats and knee-high boots, she can use sparking \"blackpowder\" pistols both to inflict damage and to double-jump or dodge while performing snappily choreographed, one-handed sword and axe combos, straight out of God of War. As regards locations, there are pale medieval citadels with stained-glass windows, coffee shops run by eerie, many-armed \"Hosts\" that glean from the ambience of Turkish bazaars, and certain other fantastical areas and characters - including Nor's spectral fox sidekick Enki - that are influenced by ancient Mesopotamian mythology. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Nursing that constant flow of foot traffic, produce and profits, all of them teetering on a carefully honed knife-edge, that's the good stuff right there. Of course, it's not always the threat of imminent and total collapse that fuels these mighty engines of urban planning. Sometimes it's the simple pleasure of building itself, watching a scrub of dirt track rise up into an advanced superhighway of architectural wonder. The best of these more relaxed kinds of citybuilders - your Dorfromantiks and your SteamWorld Builds et al - still involve plenty of plate-spinning; it's just that they won't ever fall over if you take your eye off the ball for a moment.\nBulwark: Falconeer Chronicles sits at the citybuilding crossroads of 'relaxed' and 'something more'. It wants to be an easy-going kind of builder, as nothing fundamentally bad happens when the wheels stop turning for a moment. For the most part, you're free to build where and however you please, constructing imposing fortresses jutting out into the ocean from mere scraps of rock. But it also gets more bogged down in the minutiae of resource flow, worker management and conquest and expansion via muddy, ill-defined combat procedures than it probably should. It always feels on the precipice of becoming something bigger, bolder and more boisterous than it ever really achieves, dipping its toes into the murky waters of its lonely Ursee without truly ever getting its feet wet.\nRead more",

          "description": "Palia, a cute-looking life sim MMO inspired by e.g. Stardew Valley, has been in beta since last year, but now it's officially out on Steam, where many more people can download and play it. With this launch comes a pretty substantial update - Patch 0.178, full notes here - which adds a new questline and Temple to explore, new furniture, and a bunch of new spring flowers and trees to grow in your garden. There is also a giant plushi frog, listed under 'Adjustments'. The patch notes say simply \"What does he want? Does he come in peace?\" which makes him sound way more sinister than I think he is, but as you can see from the screenshot, he isn't not sinister.\nRead more",

          "description": "It's been nearly eight years since the launch of Civilization VI, which is the longest gap between mainline Civ entries the series has seen since the first game appeared way back in 1991. It's the perfect time for a new contender to rise and claim the historical 4X throne, and indeed, many have tried, and some have even come close. Soren Johnson and the gang at Mohawk Games struck gold in Old World by zeroing in on the ancient era and opening up the personal lives of rulers and generals as fields of play. Humankind let you fuse and blend cultures over the arc of time like a world-historic Doctor Moreau.\nMillennia is perhaps the Civ-like that's clung most tightly to the genre's apron strings. It has a few new ideas that sound interesting on paper, but even as back-of-the-box features, they're clearly not meant to significantly disrupt the established order. This is a strategy game that very much wants to be like Civilization, and has a lot of enthusiasm for the subject matter. Unfortunately, it isn't a particularly good student.\nRead more",

Out later in 2024, this first-person horror game takes inspiration from the Surrealism art movement and from silent cinema, with monochrome visuals, speech cards in place of spoken dialogue, and rickety live-action footage for certain animations and transitions. But it's also, I think, a meditation on the unique kinds of grotesque only videogames can produce, one that goes beyond the mere portrayal of squalor and bloodshed to explore particular generations and traditions of videogame graphics that are intrinsically cursed. It stood out amid the breezy action games and cosy life sims of this year's Day Of The Devs expo in San Francisco like a bell-tolling plaguebearer in a crowd of Tellytubbies.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Minecraft's whimsical April Fool's update is back and better than ever, shining the spotlight on the Poisonous Potato. Although the virulent concoction has brought many headaches for farmers, the latest patch has provided a redemption of sorts. So, without further ado, here's how to get the April Fool's update in Minecraft. \n\n\nHow to access April Fools update in Minecraft Bedrock\n\n\nFor the April Fool's update, Minecraft Bedrock users can download the Poisonous Potato Add-On on the marketplace. The patch is completely free and doesn't require too much space for installation. It will also be under the creator Jigarbov Productions in Bedrock and Java. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nCreate a new world and go down to Behavior Packs to activate the April Fool's update on Minecraft Bedrock. Or, select 'Activate Add-On' directly on the marketplace's Poisonous Potato Add-On. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nTo see the latest features, use Creative mode to find the new dimensions easily. You can also search 'Potato' in the Crafting Table's encyclopedia. For example, crafters can browse items like the Poisonous Potato Guide, Explosive Poisonous Potato, and Poisonous Potato Powered Netherite Sword. \n\n\nHow to access April Fools update in Minecraft Java\n\n\nJava players can get the Minecraft April Fool's update the same way as Bedrock, but there is an alternative way with SnapShot. Open the Minecraft Launcher and go to Installations in order to play the Latest SnapShot. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nYou don't have to worry about activating the Poisonous Potato update through this method, as it will already be available. The Minecraft April Fool's update even has its own section for the Crafting Table, with potato-themed blocks, peelers, and signs. You can also discover these items for yourself in Survival mode for more of a challenge.

          "description": "Unturned is an ultra-popular multiplayer game about maybe surviving against zombies. I played it once, and my friend shot me. So, essentially, it’s lo-fi DayZ but also a lot smaller.\n\n\nWhen Unturned was initially released, it was only on PC. In 2020, it reached Xbox and PlayStation platforms. Now, in the distant future year of 2024, it has reached the ultimate platform: Switch. It’s a great game to pick up and play with friends. But if they have a Switch and you have a PC, can you still play together?\n\n\nNo, sorry. The Console and PC versions are sort of different beasts. The console versions are done by FunLabs/505, while the PC version was originally done by Smartly Dressed Games. A large number of modifications were made to the console ports to make them more playable on controllers. They’re also updated at different times and rarely have parity.\n\n\nImage via Steam\n\n\nSo, because they essentially have a different infrastructure, they’re not compatible. However, the console versions could still have the possibility for cross platform, but they don’t.\n\n\nUnturned is free on PC and runs on relatively low-end hardware, so that might be your best bet for playing against your friends. Otherwise, you’ll need to make sure you choose the same platform to play against each other.\n\nThe post Is Unturned Cross Platform? appeared first on Destructoid.",

There is plenty of new content to look forward to, such as new maps, weapons, and the return of Rebirth Island. Here's when to expect MW3 and Warzone Season 3 release time. \n\n\nMW3 and Warzone Season 3 release time\n\n\nMW3 and Warzone Season 3 launches on April 3, 2024, at 9 AM PT/ 12 PM ET/ 11 AM CT. A preload will likely be available the night before to prepare you for its release. Patch notes are also expected the day of, detailing content for Modern Warfare 3, Warzone, and Warzone Mobile. \n\n\n\nMW3 Multiplayer showcases six new Core 6v6 maps, with most available at launch (two for mid-season). Some locations may be familiar to CoD veterans, especially with Vanguard's Growhouse remastered. Plus, hit game modes are returning, from Capture the Flag to One in the Chamber. \n\n\nImage via Activision\n\n\nWhile Modern Warfare 3 Ranked Play offers new rewards for launch, Zombies mode content won't arrive until the mid-season. This includes continuing the Dark Aether story, Warlord Rainmaker, and upcoming Schematics. \n\n\nFor Warzone Season 3, we have the highly-anticipated return of the beloved Rebirth Island. It'll be the central hub for Warzone Ranked Play, featuring many helpful points of interest. Battle Royale users can utilize the map in the 44 max player match, along with a Rebirth Resurgence game mode set for mid-season. \n\n\nDon't forget that Warzone Mobile will also be included for MW3 and Warzone Season 3. Any weapons and attachments collected, whether on console, PC, or mobile, are accessible across all devices through the Connected Content system. New maps and modes are transitioning over to this platform, too, with Rust and Plunder Mode releasing on launch. \n\nThe post What time does MW3 and Warzone Season 3 release? appeared first on Destructoid.",

While I’m a lover of both Mayonnaise and Stardew Valley, I never expected this on my morning reddit dive.\n\n\nUpon heading to the Stardew Valley subreddit this morning, I was confronted with what can only be described as somebody's ode to Mayonnaise, and the following post detailing what exactly was going on:\n\n\n\n\nApparently, for one day only, players are invited to “make mayonnaise, drink mayonnaise, alarm your friends and neighbors!”. Players are also being encouraged to share both real life and in-game photographs of mayonnaise, design their own labels and people who submit their images can expect to see their mayonnaise designs added to the Stardew Valley subreddit banner. \n\n\nThere’s also the ‘mayonnaise rumble’ to take part in, which involves taking an in-game screenshot of your character chugging on their favorite type of mayonnaise from the following list:\n\n\n\nClassic Mayonnaise\n\n\nDuck Mayonnaise\n\n\nDinosaur Mayonnaise\n\n\nVoid Mayonnaise\n\n\n\nOnce taken, players are encouraged to post this screenshot under their teams comment, with the winner gaining the “great honor of lording their mayo supremacy above all others!”. I wouldn’t recommend drinking Void Mayonnaise, though, as it actively decreases your energy by a large amount. \n\n\n\n\n\nTo my horror, there have been comments from people sticking straws into mayonnaise in honor of this occassion and comments from cosplay accounts, such as this one from 'Harvey' stating that he knew this was a bad idea and the clinic will be open until 4pm. I suppose it’s to be expected with April Fool’s day well under way, and we’ve also seen Palworld throwing their own horrifying efforts into the mix, so there’s no telling where else today will take us. \n\nThe post Stardew Valley subreddit joins in the April Fool’s day fun by going mayonnaise mad appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, it's not on the live version of the horror game but rather must be accessed through the Steam beta branch. If you've never done it before, it can be tricky. Here is how to access the Lethal Company v50 Beta update as well as how to revert back when you want to return to the live version.\n\n\nHow to enable Lethal Company Update version 50\n\n\nIn order to actually play the Lethal Company version 50 update before it goes live, you will need to enable the beta branch on Steam. Here's how to enable the beta branch:\n\n\n\nRight-click Lethal Company on Steam from your Library tab.\n\n\nLeft-click on Properties.\n\n\nLeft-click on Betas.\n\n\nUnder Beta Participation, click the dropdown box and choose “public_beta”.\n\n\nSteam will now download the new beta files and update which overlaps your existing game files.\n\n\nLaunch Lethal Company from your Steam Library.\n\n\n\nKeep in mind you will have to be on the same version as friends to play with them. So if you are on the v50 beta branch and want to play with them, they will also have to be on the beta branch.\n\n\nIf you want to stop playing on the beta branch and return to version 49 of Lethal Company, just follow the same process except under Beta Participation choose \"None\" instead of \"public_beta\" and it will overwrite your game files to be on the live version.\n\n\nFurthermore, once the version 50 update finally goes live instead of only being on the beta branch, you will have to return your beta status to none. This will always return your version of the game to the current live version, regardless of which update version is currently the live one.\n\nThe post How to access Lethal Company v50 Beta appeared first on Destructoid.",

Of course, after taking a moment to think it through, it’s already April Fool’s Day in Japan. \n\n\nGetting ahead of the rest of the world, Pocketpair took to Discord and social media to share the following video that you’re either going to want to see come to fruition or will make you feel dirty in 100 different ways, and none of them good.\n\n\n\n\nPossibly the worst part about this entire video is the fact that they start the whole thing off with a teaser about what’s inside the World Tree, only for it to be a school filled with \"cute Pals.\" Fans are desperate to know what’s special about that huge tree, but this …",

          "description": "In the new Path of Exile 3.24 Necropolis league there is a brand new crafting mechanic involving the Undertaker and his Necropolis. You unlock this new mechanic after reaching Lioneye's Watch but aren't exactly told how to return to the Necropolis afterward. Here is how to get to the Necropolis in PoE 3.24.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to return to the Necropolis and Undertaker\n\n\nThere are actually two ways to return to the Necropolis in Path of Exile 3.24. Here is how to get to the Necropolis once it is unlocked:\n\n\n\nKill a haunted monster that drops its corpse. After picking up the corpse, the Undertaker will appear. Talk to the Undertaker and he will have the option to Travel to the Necropolis.\n\n\nGo to any Waypoint, either in a campaign act or in your hideout. On the right side of the World Map interface, there is a new button to Travel to the Necropolis.\n\n\n\nFor both options, the only requirement to unlock travel is encountering the Undertaker which you can do from the beginning. He will give you a quest and the Lantern of Arimor which unlocks the Morgue and the Necropolis.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to access the Morgue\n\n\nEven though the Morgue doesn't have an actual location you can visit, you'll still want to access it from time to time. The Morgue in Necropolis is essentially a storage space. As you kill haunted enemies and acquire their corpses, they will automatically be transferred to the Morgue after you collect them.\n\n\nHere is how to access the Morgue:\n\n\n\nLike the Necropolis, after picking up a corpse the Undertaker will appear and give you the option to View Necropolis Morgue.\n\n\nWhen you are at the Necropolis, you can speak with the Undertaker and choose the option to View Necropolis Morgue.\n\n\n\nThe Morgue allows you to move around, delete, and put corpses into a casket so you can then resell them.\n\nThe post How to get to the Necropolis in Path of Exile (PoE) 3.24 appeared first on Destructoid.",

First revealed in 2021, the Sekiro-inspired title is coming on May 29.\nNine Sols sports a hand-drawn art direction and an aesthetic that blends sci-fi, cyberpunk, Eastern mythology (the legend of Hou Yi in particular), and Taoism. Players control a cat-like warrior named Yi, who is awakened after years of slumber in New Kunlun, a city for humans created by nine god-like rulers. New Kunlun may appear to be a utopia, but a secret surrounds it as Yi embarks on a vengeful quest to take down all nine rulers. \n\n\nThe 2D Metroidvania features fast-paced combat and a parry system directly inspired by Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. In addition to a sword, Yi is armed with a divine bow and uses Taoist talismans to make enemies explode. A sprawling, interconnected map features numerous NPCs to assist, secrets, and challenging boss battles. \nNine Sols is coming to PC via Steam (it also has a demo).

This sale is part of Embracer’s massive, ongoing restructuring designed to cut costs after a planned $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group fell through in 2023. The sale comes three years after Embracer acquired Gearbox for $1.3 billion in 2021. \nThis move means Embracer no longer owns Gearbox’s development entities, such as Gearbox Software, Gearbox Montreal, and Gearbox Studio Quebec, nor franchises such as Borderlands/Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands, Homeworld, Risk of Rain, Brothers in Arms, and Duke Nukem. These assets will be acquired by Take-Two, which owns Rockstar Games and 2K, among other labels. Closing of the tr…",

After quietly working on its first project, the team is ready to show the world what it’s been cooking up.\nThe studio released a brief teaser of their yet-to-be-titled first game. A press release states that this mysterious project is a fantasy action-adventure title targeting a 2025 release. We won’t find out more until April 2, when IGN will reveal the game as an IGN First. \n\n\nThe studio also included two pieces of concept art, which you can view in the gallery below.\n\nYellow Brick Games was founded by Thomas Giroux (co-founder/CEO), Jeff Skalski (co-founder/COO), Frédéric St-Laurent B (game director), and Mike Laidlaw (chief creative officer). The team has offices in both Montreal and Quebec City and currently consists of 68 employees. The studio was founded to foster a \"people first\" work culture where employees' wellness takes priority while also focusing on developing titles featuring, according to their website, \"deeply interactive spaces where player creativity can shine.\"\n\"We are thrilled to share this exciting news with our community. Self-publishing is a leap of faith, especially in the current turbulent industry climate, but it’s also an opportunity to take our destiny into our own hands and reach out directly to players and the wider gaming community during this release.” says Mike Laidlaw, in a press release\"Our team has been hard at work for years, and we can’t wait to showcase our debut project to the world. It’s a huge milestone for us, and we see it as just the first step on what we hope will be a long and rewarding journey for the company, charting our own path, and growing our talents and products brick by brick.”",

          "description": "If you've been paying attention to our Game Gauntlet, a bracket where our readers decide the best game of all time, you might have noticed one contender has been an unstoppable force – The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. It nuked Fallout 3, omnislashed Final Fantasy VII, felled Elden Ring (without using spirit ashes), and survived the hordes of The Last of Us. Skyrim was a groundbreaking open-world adventure when it was first released, and fans clearly have plenty of love for it in the 13 years since then and now, so it's no surprise the gaming community has been clamoring for news about a sequel for years now. Luckily, we do have a minor update for fans who need something to tide them over just a little longer.\nThirty years ago, The Elder Scrolls series began with The Elder Scrolls: Arena, so Bethesda put together a little celebratory post touring through each game in the franchise. The post, which you can read in its entirety below, ends with a small section about the highly anticipated next entry.\nThe relevant section says, \"Last but not least, yes, we are in development on the next chapter – The Elder Scrolls VI. Even now, returning to Tamriel and playing early builds has us filled with the same joy, excitement, and promise of adventure.\"\nThere's really not much to go on, but as Kotaku points out, this does confirm that the series will stay on the continent of Tamriel rather than venturing off to other areas in the fantasy world, along with the fact that the game is at least in a playable state. That said, there's no telling how far off from release it still is; the last we heard was from Microsoft's private documents that were leaked during its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which put the release date somewhere 2026 or later.\nFor more Bethesda, check out the news about The Elder Scrolls' newest spin-off,  read our Starfield review, and see which Xbox games are coming to other platforms.",

Today, Capcom outlined some of its plans to update the game in the \"near future,\" but specifically notes that improvements to frame rate will come in later patches. That said, these quick fixes are still useful.\nIn addition to general text and bug fixes, there are a few significant quality-of-life improvements.

The game is also getting a collector’s edition.  \nThe $39.99 expansion takes players to the tropical island of Yok Tural and introduces a new storyline, two new playable classes (Pictomancer and Viper), and the level cap raised to 100, among other additions. Dawntrail will be available in all versions of the game, including the newly launched Xbox editions. \nDuring PAX East this past weekend, FFXIV director/producer Naoki Yoshida unveiled the Dawntrail Digital Collector’s Edition and the goodies-filled physical Collector’s Box. Here’s what comes in each package: \nCollector’s Box ($155.00)\n\nDawntrail Special Art Box \nExpertly Crafted Viper Figure (H 9.65\" x W 4.52\" x D 5.90\"/H 24.5cm x W 11.5cm x D 15cm)\nAdventurer’s Cloth Map (16.53\" x 29.52\"/42cm x 75cm)\nThe Unending Journey Notebook (5.90\" x 4.33\"/15cm x 11cm)\nAdventurer’s Pen Case (8.26\" x 9.44\"/21cm x 24cm)\nDawntrail Digital Collector’s Edition ($59.99)\n\nIn-game Item: Ark Mount \nIn-game Item: Garnet Minion \nIn-game Item: Chocobo Brush: Pictomancer Weapon \nWhile the Digital Collector's Edition and Collector's Box must be purchased separately, a bundle containing both is called the Dawntrail Collector's Edition and runs for $214.99. However, it only contains a game code for the Windows/Mac version of Dawntrail. \nPre-orders for the standard and collector's edition items begin Tuesday, March 26, at 9 a.m. PT.

A free demo hits the PlayStation Store this Friday, March 29, and will throw players headfirst into the game's opening moments. To get an idea of what that gameplay looks like, check out the demo trailer below.\n\n\nGame director Hyung Tae Kim gave a deeper explanation on the PlayStation Blog. He writes, \"This first stage will include the tutorial phase to help you familiarize yourself with basic combat features as you explore post-war Eidos 7, a human city now infested by the Naytiba, giving you an early grasp of gameplay mechanics that will serve you throughout the game’s story.\"\nStellar Blade was quietly in development over the past few years (originally known as Project EVE) before its in-depth feature during January's State of Play event. The game follows Eve, the wielder of the titular Stellar Blade, as she journeys back down to Earth to save the people there from alien and robot attacks. For more on the game, you can take a look at our four-page feature in issue 364 of Game Informer magazine.\nStellar Blade is a PS5 exclusive that launches on April 26.

The new story content opens the door to an entirely new area to explore in Valisthea, but the big draw is the appearance of the Eikon Leviathan. \nBack in December, Final Fantasy XVI players were treated to the Echoes of the Fallen expansion, which took Clive and his companions to a long-abandoned tower created by the Fallen precursor civilization. The Rising Tide will further expand on the game's story, but in a new direction, focusing on Leviathan. In the new story sequence, a letter arrives to the hideaway with a request for help from the Dominant of that long-lost Eikon of Water, and the party must set out to face a new threat. We detailed some of what we learned in a preview earlier this month. \nThe new trailer puts a big focus on combat sequences, giving us a good look at several fights, including Clive acting as Ifrit to battle against Leviathan as they each coast over a massive body of water. The new sights and characters offer a convincing reason to redownload that massive RPG and take Clive for one more big adventure. \n\n\n\nAre you planning to jump back into Final Fantasy XVI for this Leviathan-themed DLC?

We now know the title of that update, along with a release window.\nThe newly christened Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered is coming later this year. Unfortunately, the game’s website and Steam page don’t detail exactly how the game has been enhanced from a performance standpoint. Grasshopper did release screenshots, so you’ll have to use those to discern the difference between this re-release and the original. A demo of the game is currently playable at Grasshopper’s booth at PAX East. \n\nShadows of the Damned was first released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on June 21, 2011, and served as a collaboration between Resident Evil mastermind Shinji Mikami (who served as producer) and Grasshopper founder Goichi “Suda51” Suda (the game's writer). It stars Garcia Hotspur, a demon hunter who battles his way through the depths of the underworld to rescue his captive girlfriend, Paula. The game’s fun, over-the-shoulder shooter action combined with its irreverent, absurd humor earned it a 9.25 out of 10 in our original review and a cult following over the last 13 years. EA originally published Shadows of the Damned, and it was never ported to other platforms. Grasshopper is self-publishing the remaster. \nShadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",

First revealed last June at the Xbox Games Showcase, it centers on an oil rig worker fighting to survive a supernatural threat. \nDeveloped by The Chinese Room, today’s Future Game Show provided a platform for a new trailer that serves as an effective tone-setter. Set in 1975, you play as an oil rig worker trapped on a deep sea rig off the coast of Scotland. Communications have been lost, and an unknown horror has overtaken the rig. The first-person adventure tasks you with locating your crew as a mysterious threat pursues you, and the raging ocean gradually tears the rig apart. With no weapons or special abilities, exploration is the name of the game.\n\n\nStill Wakes the Deep is launching on June 18 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. It will also launch on Game Pass for console and PC. \nFor more on The Chinese Room, the studio has also taken the reins of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, also slated to release this year.

          "description": "Baldur’s Gate 3 was one of 2023’s most successful and critically acclaimed games, with many hailing it as one of the best role-playing games ever made. However, if you were hoping for the game to get an expansion or a sequel, that won’t be the case - at least not from its developer, Larian Studios. \nAs reported by PC Gamer, Larian CEO Swen Vincke stated during an address at GDC today that the studio is finished with Baldur’s Gate 3. That means it won’t be getting any expansions nor will it be making a Baldur’s Gate 4. \"We are a company of big ideas. We are not a company that's made to create DLCs or expansions,\" Vincke said. \"We tried that actually, a few times. It failed every single time. It's not our thing. Life is too short. Our ambitions are very large.”\nNot only that, but the studio is moving on from Dungeons & Dragons in general, with Vincke saying that \"it's going to be up to Wizards of the Coast because it's their IP, to find somebody to take over the torch.\"\n\n\nWhile Vincke says Larian is proud of what it accomplished, the studio wants to focus on a brand-new project. There's no telling what Larian may tackle next; given that it made Baldur's Gate 3 and the Divinity series, it's hard to imagine the studio not making another RPG of some sort. We'll have to wait and see. \nBaldur’s Gate 3 was released last August following a lengthy early access period to rave reviews, including several Game of the Year wins. While it’s disappointing that we won’t see any meaningful story updates for the title, we’re excited to see what Larian has in store next. \nAs for other Dungeons & Dragons games that will pick up the torch, there's a few big titles on the horizon. Chief among them is Starbreeze's in-development D&D cooperative multiplayer game and Gameloft's D&D survival sim. \nYou can read our review of Baldur's Gate 3 here. The game is also nominated for 10 BAFTA Awards next month, and you can read the full list of nominees here. \n[Source: PC Gamer]",

In that short timeframe it has earned rave reviews (including a 9.5 out of 10 from us), positioned itself as a Game of the Year contender, and sold 1 million copies. To the delight of many, a mobile version was recently announced to be in the works. \nFor some players, Balatro seemingly came out of nowhere and its sole developer, LocalThunk, is just as mysterious. The highly private creator doesn't share his real name, but I was able to speak with him about his game development history, his philosophy for making games, how he came up with the idea for Balatro, and his reaction to its positive reception. Perhaps most importantly, LocalThunk also tells me the…",

Based on the hit Ark: Survival Evolved, the series was first announced at The Game Awards in 2020 and went from not having a release date or platform to suddenly having its first six episodes available now in the U.S. and Canada.\nThe series follows Helena Walker, a paleontologist who washes ashore a mysterious island brimming with dinosaurs and other extinct wildlife. After meeting another survivor and hunter named Bob, Helena learns how to fend for herself in this strange land while encountering myriad threats and survivors from throughout history. While the first six episodes of Season 1 are out now, the remaining seven episodes will arrive at a later date. \nThe show’s star-studded cast includes Madeleine Madden, Michelle Yeoh, Vin Diesel, Gerard Butler, David Tennant, Russell Crowe, Jeffrey Wright, Karl Urban, Zahn McClarnon, Devery Jacobs, Elliot Page, Malcolm McDowell, Deborah Mailman, and Alan Tudyk. Check out the premiere trailer below. \n\n\nTo mark the occasion, Ark: Survival Ascended is holding a special tie-in event in which players can unlock skins based on characters from the animated series, which replicate the show’s art style. Obtaining these involves collecting a series of notes titled “Dear Jane” written by Karl Urban’s character in the show, Bob. The first drop of skins will be for Helena, Bob, Dodo, and Scary the Parasaur. New notes will appear in the game each Tuesday and Thursday until April 11. Check out the trailer below.\n\n\nMeanwhile, we're still awaiting an update on the long-quiet Ark 2 (also featuring Vin Diesel) which was announced in 2020 at The Game Awards. That game is currently scheduled to launch towards the end of the year. Hopefully this animated show is a decent holdover until the next big game arrives.",

It also has its first trailer and a release window.\nFirst announced in 2022, the game stars Captain America and Black Panther Azzuri, who is the grandfather of T’Challa. The trailer shows them pursuing the mutual goal of taking down the Nazis/Hydra, though for their own personal reasons. Hailing from different worlds, neither is particularly fond of the other's methods, which draws them into conflict. The game also stars Gabriel Jones of the Howling Commandos and Wakanda spy leader Nanali. First revealed at GDC, check out its first cinematic trailer below. \n\n\nMarvel 1943 is a linear single-player experience where you’ll occupy the roles of all four characters at various points, providing different perspectives on the narrative and the war. The project is led by Skydance president Amy Hennig, best known as the principle writer of the Uncharted franchise. \nMarvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is coming in 2025, though platforms are currently unknown. You can learn more about how Skydance is approaching the game’s storytelling by reading our 2022 interview feature with Amy Hennig and Skydance's story consultant, Marc Bernardin.",

Bandai Namco showed off what's new, what's staying the same, and even revealed more characters joining the roster. \nNaturally, Goku and Vegeta square off to show off Sparking Zero’s combat. The 3D fighter retains the familiar behind-the-back style of its predecessors, but graphically speaking, the flashy ki blasts and transformations look better than ever. \n\n\nThe presentation introduces four new mechanics. First up is Skill Count, a number that rises as you execute moves during the battle and is then spent to trigger special abilities. Revenge Counter lets players retaliate with a big attack in the midst of absorbing damage. Super Perception is a parry-type move that lets players deflect an attack at the last moment (such as Goku smacking away Vegeta’s Galick Gun), but doing this spends Skill Count points. Lastly, Vanishing Assaults are teleport-based attacks designed to close the gap at mid-range to keep the pressure on your opponent.\nDragon Ball Sparking Zero looks to have a massive roster of fighters (many of them variations of Goku and Vegeta), and the following characters are joining the line-up:\nBroly (Super Saiyan Full Power)\nBurter\nDyspo\nHit\nJeice\nKakunsa\nKale (Super Saiyan Berserk)\nMaster Roshi (Max Power)\nNappa\nSuper Trunks\nToppo\n\nDragon Ball Sparking Zero still doesn’t have a release window, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

Diablo IV, one of Blizzard's big 2023 releases, comes to Xbox Game Pass late next week, on March 28. We enjoyed the game quite a bit at launch, calling it a \"massive and deeply engrossing action RPG,\" so if you've been waiting to check it out, now is a good time to do so.\nThis month also includes a trio of games built around cars, though the three are each very different. F1 23 simulates the realism and intensity of Formula 1 racing, Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 is an arcade racer full of child-like wonder, and Open Roads (which will launch on Game Pass) is a quieter, narrative-driven game about a mother and her daughter going on a road trip. Maybe they'll help me on my journey of learning how to drive.\nHere's the rest of the line-up:\nWhat's Coming To Game Pass This Month\nLightyear Frontier (Game Preview) (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) – Today\nMLB The Show 24 (Cloud and Console) – Today\nThe Quarry (Cloud and Console) – March 20 | Our Review\nEvil West (Cloud, Console, and PC) – March 21\nTerra Invicta (Game Preview) (PC) – March 26\nDiablo IV (Console and PC) – March 28 | Our Review\nHot Wheels Unleashed 2 – Turbocharged (Cloud, Console, and PC) – March 28 | Our Review\nOpen Roads (Cloud, Console, and PC) – March 28\nArk: Survival Ascended (Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X|S) – April 1\nF1 23 (Cloud) EA Play – April 2\nSuperhot: Mind Control Delete (Cloud, Console, and PC) – April 2 | Our Review\nWhat's Leaving Game Pass On March 31\nHot Wheels Unleashed (Cloud, Console, and PC) | Our Review\nInfinite Guitars (Cloud, Console, and PC) \nMLB The Show 23 (Cloud and Console) | Our Review",

The large 3,745-piece set is set to release on April 1 in LEGO stores and to those in the LEGO Insiders program. Everyone else can roll for initiative on snagging a set on April 4, for the price of $359.99.\nProduced through the popular LEGO Ideas platform, where fans are able to submit their own build concepts that are then refined and produced as official sets, the final set includes a full dungeon and tower, a tavern, and six minifigures (including an Orc Rogue, Gnome Fighter, Elf Wizard, and Dwarf Cleric). Builders also get several iconic D&D monsters, including an owlbear, beholder, displacer beast, and, of course, the red dragon Cinderhowl, who acts as the centerpiece of the set.\n\nInterestingly, LEGO is offering an actual D&D adventure book to LEGO Insiders as a free digital download or as a paperback book that can be purchased with 2,7000 Insider points. That same book will show up on D&D Beyond (Wizards of the Coast’s digital hub for D&D) complete with characters sheets and digital dice. Presumably, the idea is that you could play out the adventure with the included LEGO minifigs and monsters as the miniatures used on the table, which is a pretty slick way for dedicated players to capitalize on the completed build.\nIn addition to the larger set, LEGO also revealed plans for a full line of D&D-themed minifigures, launching in September 2024.\nWill you be checking out this crossover set?

Its creator, solo developer ConcernedApe, has updated it with plenty of free patches over the years, adding multiplayer, new farm types, and more, but when he moved on to work on his next game, Haunted Chocolatier, the Stardew updates came to an end.

Publisher Playstack also revealed a mobile version is in development.\nCreated by solo developer LocalThunk, Balatro is a roguelike tasking players to play poker hands to fulfill score criteria and advance a series of rounds. Along the way, they’ll spend money to augment their deck with new cards with special effects while collecting powerful Jokers that bestow a wide range of passive and trigger abilities.  \nThe game has earned widespread acclaim and popularity since launching on February 20. I awarded it a 9.5 out of 10, writing in my review, “Balatro is an ingenious and entertaining roguelike and one of my favorite games of the year. Playing it has become a near-obsession; everything feels perfectly designed to encourage you to keep trying because that next run could be the run of your life. Even after hours of play, I still can’t overcome Balatro’s biggest challenge: putting it down.”\n\n\nIn a press release announcing the 1 million milestone, LocalThunk writes, \n“I'm so grateful to all the players and people that have made this happen. I still can't grasp the response to this game, and I am overjoyed that so many people have been able to have fun with my silly creation. I'm so fortunate that I can continue working on my passion as a career. Thank you!”\nBalatro is currently available for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. There’s no release window for the impending mobile versions.",

The platform was featured unusually prominently and the studios seemed confident of the operators' whereabouts. Whatever the intent, DoodStream's operators are now being sued by Hollywood, Netflix, Amazon and Apple, who apparently identified them as long ago as last summer.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

          "description": "For the 17th time, ScummVM has again been accepted for the Google Summer of Code program this summer.\nThe program intends to bring new contributors into open source projects. In the most recent two years this has included both students and non-students as eligible candidates for participation.\nLike last year, participants can apply for working on either short tasks (about 175 hours of work), or large tasks (about 350 hours of work). The coding period typically runs from start of June through August, but there is some flexibility which allows participants to have longer time frames if they are unable to work full time through the summer.\nScummVM is looking for people interested in participating in GSoC with us. A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we are also open to your own ideas as well. Please provide the required information in your application before submitting.\nWe also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server, in the #scummvm-gsoc channel. This allows you to engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, to get advice about how to get involved with the project, as well as writing your application.\nBased on our previous 16 years of experience with GSoC, we have put together a Google Summer of Code miniportal to help you get started.\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\n>",

The titans of industry were inspired to produce more goods when I visited their factories. But as the years have passed, so do their eyes pass over me, to eye curiously my replacements. Will you try the new style, ma’am? It’s so much better than that old thing. I’ve watched my friends grow old and die. My brother got caught in traffic and caused a horrific level crossing collision. I get sick more often, wheezing to a halt wherever I am. When I visit the doctor for a spot of renewal, they tell me, “Sorry, I can’t help. You’re too old.” When will I be autoreplaced? Woe is the tale of the Balogh Goods Truck. But what if we could slow or pause the steady march of time? In OpenTTD 14, you can.",

          "description": "If you don’t know me, I’m Owen Rudge, and have been involved in the online Transport Tycoon community for almost 25 years. Exactly 21 years ago, I received an ICQ message (look it up, kids) out of the blue from a guy named Ludvig Strigeus (nicknamed Ludde). “Hello, you probably don’t know me, but I’ve been working on a project to clone TTD for a while.” he said, more or less. He didn’t want to release this to the public yet, and wasn’t entirely sure what he was going to do with it. (He’d been working on it since 30th June 2002, so I guess that is technically the birthday of what would become OpenTTD…) Ludde sent me a copy of what he’d been working on, and it was very exciting indeed. It was a fully functional version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, written in C. Admittedly incomplete at that time, it was still quite remarkable.",
