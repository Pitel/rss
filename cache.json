In Yaza Games' Inkulinati, your champions are the odd animals that litter the pages of medieval manuscripts, led across the battlefield by the hand of an easily distracted artist.\nThat is the crux of what makes Inkulinati unique and clever – you are not playing as any of the creatures on the field of battle. Instead, you are playing as the person drawing them, whether they are a knight engaging in scholarly pursuits or a monk spending their days painstakingly recreating a single copy of an important tome. Each of the units you spawn is scribbled into existence by this unseen person, something that, for better or worse, drives every gameplay mechanic you encounter.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

If you have a) been enjoying Cobalt Core as part of RPS Game Club this month, and b) especially like it when Soggins turns up with his ship of malfunctioning missile launchers, then I implore you to make Sunshine Heavy Industries your next port of call in your Steam library. It's what the Cobalt Core devs Rocket Rat Games made first, and you can immediately see a lot of shared DNA between the two games - not least its chunky, charming pixel visuals and some crossover between its cast of characters - including our pal Soggins. \nIt is, I should stress, a very different game to Cobalt Core - it's a sandboxy spaceship builder with zero combat involved, for starters - but I've been playing it again this week ahead of some other Game Club-themed articles I've got cooking, and I've been having a lovely time with it. Not least because I get to spend more time with Soggins the very smug frog, all while listening to even more excellent chill tunes from Cobalt Core composer Aaron Cherof. \nRead more",

          "description": "I'm kind of fascinated by what happened to Hello Neighbor. The original, a stealth horror game against a creepy AI that learned your likely movements, was hugely popular in alpha in 2016. The series was acquired by TinyBuild in 2020, and since then there has been a heroic number of spin-offs. There's one set in an amusement park, a multiplayer game called Secret Neighbor in which one small child is actually a large adult man in disguise, a direct sequel called Hello Neighbor 2, and a VR game called Search And Rescue. I think everyone got a bit of Neighbor fatigue there, lads.\nThis might include the original creator Nikita Kolesnikov, as (still under the auspices of TinyBuild) he's made a new thing. Currently on Steam for playtesting, the project currently known as RBO isn't falling far from the home invasion tree, as players will either be a home-owning Protector - a McCallister, if you will - or an Intruder, or Wet Bandit.\nRead more",

After nearly a decade of delays, you’d probably just want to get it out the door, right? Skip straight to the open-world pirate adventuring, none of that 'making it work on a range of graphics cards' nonsense.\nBut nope. For all its other shortcomings, Skull and Bones performs alright on PC, very often more smoothly than its system requirements suggest. Though I’d still recommend abiding by its SSD storage requirement – following the rules might not be very piratey, but installing on a hard drive will curse you to some pretty tedious load screen waits. Geoffrey Rush would hate it, honestly.\nWhile Edwin sequesters himself in the starting area, let’s head below deck for a closer look at Skull and Bones’ PC particulars. That includes a full rundown of its graphics options – which include ray tracing and DLSS – and a quick guide to the best settings for an ideal prettiness-to-performance ratio.\n Read more",

Tracking technology has many pitfalls, including how Google Maps can be accidentally used to track people, and the fact that if you systematically turn off cookies, your internet browsing experience becomes increasingly bizarre. I am offered adverts for afro hair care products and huge bags of puppy kibble, because the algorithms no longer have any idea who I am or how many small dogs I have. And yet.\nSurely this technology has reached the point where, if I open a game for the first time in several weeks, it should be able to tell I haven't played for a long time, and ask if I would like a small refresher of the controls.\nRead more",

The modern controls are bad, plain and simple, and are as much an enemy to Tomb Raider's incredibly precise mode of 3D platforming as the tigers and wolves that stalk its trap-filled catacombs.

That research has paid off, for here I am writing about the strikes, though I think I probably would have written about them anyway.\nRead more",

          "description": "When it comes to co-op shooters and most other multiplayer games, it's often the case that friendly fire is switched off by default or there are endless systems in place to make it a punishable offence. In Helldivers 2 it isn't actively encouraged, nor is it punished. Accidentally vaporising your teammate with an air strike is all a part of the campaign for democracy and freedom, a hilarious byproduct of human error. I gushed about it in my review, and cheery RPS fanzine PC Gamer wrote up a quick piece on the specific ways it eeks out silliness.\nBut comedy isn't just accidental in Helldivers 2, oh no. I think it encourages playground behaviour of the worst order: smacking your mates into things.\nRead more",

It would be in danger of becoming workmanlike, such are the number of things you can tick off on your fingers like a plumber ordering parts: boss fights against improbably huge glowing monsters, an evil god, catboys, numbers popping off enemies, women who appreciate the combat applications of a thigh-high split skirt, anachronistic sunglasses, horned giants carrying halberds of the same approximate size as a caravan.\nIn practice, though, you sort of can't be mad at Granblue Fantasy: Relink. It's built around a layered combat system that seems impenetrable if you don't take some time to understand it. But really, Granblue Fantasy: Relink is just a game so committed to the rule of cool that the entire setting is physically impossible, and every battle is a disorientating Panic! At The Firework Factory that flirts with being a photosensitivity nightmare. I'm not selling it as such, but it's actually charming.\r\n\n \nRead more",

But outside this guided co-op session, several members of the RPS Treehouse were playing it on their lonesome last week, too, getting to grips with Nightingale's particular flavour of sticks-and-stones crafting, cooking up meat and berry wraps to keep ourselves fed, and generally being cajoled and maybe even lightly seduced by our fae Shakespearean guide, Puck.\nWith so many folks playing it - some diehard survival heads and others who are mostly just glad to be having a break from Palworld for a spell - it quickly became apparent that lots of us had quite different takes on how Nightingale worked as a craft 'em up. I swear, I don't think our RPS Slack chat has ever seen such passionate discussions about UI layouts and hotkey assignments, so we thought it might be fun (and useful) to try and distil some of those thoughts for you. Will Nightingale succeed in capturing survival newcomers with its peculiar blend of gaslamp tea leaves, or will it chaff like a Victorian corset for the survival hardcore?

There's something about that game's isometricky vantage point and precise combination of 2D pixel characters and 3D environments.

If you’re still reading, congratulations, you’ve either got a dangerously high tolerance for bad literary jokes or you’re really eager to hear about Nightingale, the new survival sim from Inflexion, which launches into early access on 20th February. A quick recap on Nightingale, in case you missed our early access preview today: it's a strongly British-influenced \"gaslamp fantasy\" experience in which players travel alone or in groups between procedurally generated fairy realms using magic portals. You can build bases in each Realm, go on story quests and hunt the wildlife for crafting materials.\nLast week, RPS adventurers Edders, Kiera, Jeremy, Ollie and myself had a chance to play co-op with Aaryn Flynn, Inflexion’s CEO and former general manager at BioWare, while chatting to him about the game over Discord. The resulting, not entirely planned group interview lasted two hours and consisted mostly of people yelling at each other about ice ammo and tree monsters, but we did find time for some proper Q&A. Please find below an abbreviated transcript.\r\n\n \nRead more",

That's a neat Hollow Knight-looking Metroivanida roguelike, I'll definitely give that a go.\" And having played its demo over the weekend, I can confirm: it's certainly an intriguing little thing that I'll be keen to keep an eye on when it launches into early access, possibly sometime next month. \nThe biggest surprise was that, despite its very Hollow Knight-looking visuals, it actually plays more like Dead Cells in practice. Instead of being a sentient lump of flesh able to inhabit infinite bodies, you're a magical witch's hat that can possess, discard and rematerialise your chosen sack of limbs at the touch of a button. The second thing that surprised me was that it also has quite a substantial base/village building aspect to it on the side, and the third - well, perhaps this isn't so much of a surprise given everything I've just said, because it also turns out this is the next game from Palworld developers Pocketpair.

Don't Nod - who I am starting to suspect make their magic teen angsthologies to fund their real passion for \"grimdark grown-up fantasy that you sort of suspect should be a book series\" - have followed up 2018's third-person action effort Vampyr with this new semi-epic.\nBanishers has a lot in common with the interwar bloodsucker, including methodical investigations and stacking moral choices, but is a much more accomplished effort. Banishers combines a sweeping, tragic love story with some very decent swashbuckling, shooting possessed skeletons in the face, and being disappointed at Puritans. A perfect game, some may say. I'd elevator-pitch it to you as a sort of goth Uncharted where you find-and-replace \"treasure\" with \"ghosts\".\r\n\n \nRead more",

They're a group of game devs based in Melbourne who formed a gang (the titular Grannies) of older people in Rockstars rootin', tootin' cowboy RPG Red Dead Redemption 2 - specifically Red Dead Online. In the pursuit of fun,  The Grannies, using a glitch known to a lot of the community, broke through the invisible walls in the game's wild west and into another, wilder west - a landscape nobody was really meant to see.\nMarie Foulston, a curator who specialises in installations focused on video games, made a short documentary film about them and what they saw in 2019. Now V Buckenham (who has made many things, but may be known to most as the creator of Cheap Bots Done Quick!) to present The Grannies to watch for free online, in an immersive website experience that itslef looks like a glitching out landscape.\nRead more",

          "description": "The major thing Inflexion's fantasy survival sim Nightingale gets right is that it makes procedural generation feel like sorcery. \"Procgen\" has become a ubiquitous concept in game design and especially survival game design, and I fear we've all lost sight of how magical it is to summon a landscape full of idiosyncratic flourishes from a hidden dataset. It's partly, in fairness, that many semi-randomised settings feel indistinct, smooshed together with little of the character you'd get from a \"hand-made\" environment and setting. Nightingale slices through the ennui in a couple of ways. \r\n\n\r\nOne is that this is a relatively storied and text-driven survival experience, with a self-summoning fairy narrator, Puck, who immediately buries you in Shakespearean turns of phrase as he weaves the history of a multiple-dimensional universe of \"Fae\" realms, roamed by creatures of Irish, English and Scottish myth and legend. I'm not sure Puck will be everybody's cup of tea as principal quest-giver and narrator - according to Inflexion boss Aaryn Flynn, some early players have struggled to make head or tail of his dialogue. But he helps conjure up an eldritch mood that sets Nightingale apart from most genre fantasies, including the Dragon Age titles Flynn once worked on at BioWare.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I'll say it now: it doesn't always stick the landing. But if there's one thing Ultros does constantly throughout its 15-odd hour runtime, it's that it's always, always interesting. And for that, it has my respect - even if by the time the (first) end credits rolled, I was ready to never touch it ever again.\nRead more",

When they asked him why remake Final Fantasy 7 at all, his response hit me much harder than I was expecting. He said that the original FF7 is \"probably going to be always that game my dad played, and I don't want it to be that.\" Aside from making me crumble to dust with irrelevancy, this really got me thinking about older games, the way we play them now, and just what role remakes and remasters have in today's PC gaming landscape. So come and feel incredibly old with me as I try and get my (very jumbled and loosely-related) thoughts in order.\nRead more",

          "description": "When playing any character-driven videogame I sometimes experience a sensation akin to my eyes unfocussing, and remember that I'm not, strictly speaking, controlling a body in a world, but interacting with a simulation that includes representations of a body and a world. The character is just an interfacial node in a vast tangle of visible and invisible elements; by moving the character, I cause objects, surfaces, creatures to load or unload, spring into motion or change colour and a million things besides.\nSome games foreground these interdependencies by fictionalising the simulation as a giant organism or ecosystem, a more intriguing kind of \"living, breathing\" environment which is aware of your presence within it. Amongst these games is Ultros, a side-scrolling, psychedelic metroidvania - or as developers Hadoque might prefer, \"gardenvania\" - which launches next week.\n Read more",

The answer is apparently \"be ruddy heroes in a cute Soulslike\". I think this game, too, looks very cute, although Slime Heroes doesn't have a release window yet.\nYou know what does have a launch date now? Botany Manor, a lovely 3D puzzle game about growing plants, which I first learned about via the Steam Next Fest demo, and with which I immediately fell in love.

          "description": "We’ve come to know our Pals pretty well over the last month since the game entered early access. We know their names, abilities, and skills by heart, it seems. Now, a recent Twitter post by Pocketpair has got fans of the game humorously questioning whether the same is true about the developers.\n\n\nEagle-eyed fans were quick to point out that not only did Pocketpair get the name of their own creation wrong, but they also seemingly used the wrong number from the Paldeck. Pal number 61 is actually Kitsun, not Blazehowl. Or should that be Kingferno?\n\n\nPalworld fans left confused after Pockpair gets their own Pal names wrong\n\n\n\n\nThe team at Pocketpair was quick to notice and apologize for their mistake, but the post is currently still live with the blunder included. Bucky, the Community Manager for Pocketpair, entered the comments to note the mistake, too. \n\n\nStrangely, the video uploaded to YouTube at the same time also featured the mistake, but this has since been rectified. \n\n\nThe post has prompted an interesting response within the comments, with many players stating that they actually prefer this accidentally mistaken name to the one Blazehowl ended up with. One commenter said, “I think we can all agree that ‘Kingferno’ is a much cooler name”.\n\n\nCommenters on both Twitter and YouTube were also quick to point out that within the Technology Ladder, Blazehowl Noct’s Saddle is currently named “Dark Kingferno Saddle”, prompting many to speculate why the name was changed for the early access release.\n\n\nThere have been a couple of name changes since Palworld hit early access, with Ice Kingpaca and Ice Reptyro becoming Kingpaca Cryst and Reptyro Cryst, so it’s not outside of the realm of possibility to expect more name changes in the future, although it seems that Blazehowl is here to stay, even if some players prefer the alternative.\n\nThe post Palworld devs confuse fans by appearing to forget Pal’s name appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Palworld is full of modding possibilities, from replacing assets with funnier options to tweaking game settings in order to make it more enjoyable, there have been a lot of mods. \n\n\nNow, a new mod by Cristiferbeast allows you to play in first-person, right in the thick of things. \n\n\n\n\nModders add a First Person view to Palworld\n\n\nIn the first few days after the game first launched on January 19, there was a glitch that left players stuck inside their own bodies. It caused some pretty gruesome moments, but this seems to have been fixed in a past patch. That said, it can sometimes be distracting to constantly be looking at yourself, especially during moments when you want to take in what you’re seeing without your character drawing your attention.\n\n\nCristiferbeast's mod fixes that by making Palworld essentially an FPS. The mod can be found on both NexusMods or CurseForge, and once you’ve followed the installation instructions and got everything set up, all you need to do to enable first-person mode is press Alt+C. To disable first-person mode and go back to the intended third-person view, you just need to press Alt+V. \n\n\nIt’s worth noting that Palworld was never intended to be played in first-person mode. While this may seem like I’m stating the obvious here, installing and using this mod may result in some visual glitches or other issues. \n\n\nHowever, this may be a mod that’s of use to those who enjoy taking and sharing in-game screenshots in order to remove their character from the picture. Currently, there is no in-game photo mode, and it’s something that players are hoping to get in a future update. \n\nThe post Palworld mod allows you to play in first-person mode appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "When it comes to live service games such as Last Epoch, there are times when gameplay needs to be organized around maintenance and server downtime. With the game releasing fully on February 21, of course, there’s going to be maintenance, so here’s everything you need to know. \n\n\nDuring the Twitch stream Q&A on February 16, Last Epoch developers urged people to spread the word about the upcoming 24-hour server maintenance period, so here I am to do just that. \n\n\nIf you’re wondering what you’re going to do while the game is inaccessible, you could always head over to r/games on Reddit, where the development team will be doing an AMA. Alternatively, you can check out our guide on what to expect once 1.0 lands. \n\n\nWhen is the next Last Epoch Maintenance?\n\n\nPrior to the full release of Last Epoch, servers will be down for approximately 24 hours beginning at roughly 11 am CST (9 am PST / 12 pm EST / 5 pm GMT). Servers will be live again, provided no issues arise during maintenance, at the same time the following day and 1.0 will be live from this point onwards. \n\n\nAre Last Epoch maintenance periods always 24 hours?\n\n\nLast Epoch server maintenance periods usually last approximately two hours, but it’s worth remembering just how many updates are being implemented in preparation for the launch of 1.0. \n\n\nThis 24-hour maintenance is not something that’s likely to be repeated often, with perhaps the exception of future large updates. \n\n\nOther live service games, such as Final Fantasy XIV or Genshin Impact, regularly undergo longer periods of server maintenance in order to implement larger updates, so there’s no reason that Last Epoch would be any different. \n\nThe post Last Epoch servers will be down for 24h maintenance on February 20 appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's a good problem to have, but a problem nonetheless, which is why the devs have taken a drastic step to fix the problem. \n\n\nHelldivers 2 caps player count at 450k\n\n\nAnnounced in the official Helldivers 2 Discord and reported on Twitter by Wario64, Helldivers 2 concurrent player counts have been capped at 450,000. \n\n\n\n\nIt's a drastic step for a game that relies on multiplayer and may only further compound issues that have been frustrating players. Server failure errors and long log-in queues have been the name of the game for Helldivers to date. The game is actually just winding down a bonus XP weekend announced held to compensate players who had been impacted by previous server instability. \n\n\nAddressing these stability issues has been the top priority for Arrowhead, who rolled out a patch as recently as February 14 to attempt to further optimize matchmaking.\n\n\nWhile the cap may not be the best news for players, they can find some solace in that Arrowhead regards it as a temporary issue, and are working to raise the cap further to allow for more players and better stability. \n\n\nHelldivers 2 is available now on PlayStation 5 and PC. \n\nThe post Helldivers 2 has limited player counts to stop server crashes appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Hasbro, the parent company that owns the Dungeons & Dragons license, has raked in $90 million in royalty fees since the release of Baldur's Gate 3, according to a Bloomberg report. The 2023 Game of the Year for many outlets has been a massive success with a 96% review rating from over 500,000 Steam gamers. \n\n\n\"Baldur’s Gate 3, last year’s most critically acclaimed video game, has brought in about $90 million since its August release for parent company Hasbro Inc. through a licensing deal,\" wrote Bloomberg's Cecilia D'Anastasio. \n\n\nDespite the $90 million in revenue, Hasbro has laid off many of its staff. It cut 1,000 of its full-time staff in January after taking away 900 jobs over the past few months. CBC News reports 29% of Hasbro's workforce has been let go. This came after a reportedly weak holiday season. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\nDespite that horrible news, the universally beloved game was given Game of the Year from The Game Awards over steep competition like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Marvel's Spider-Man 2, among others. It also just won the coveted prize from the DICE Awards. \n\n\nDespite the game's 1.0 release back in August, developer Larian Studios is still updating Baldur's Gate 3 six months later. In today's sixth patch, unique kisses have been added to the game for each romancable character. \n\n\n\"All characters now have unique kisses that reflect their personality, with an emphasis on the plural,\" said Larian Studios in an update blog on Steam. \"These kisses are randomised and vary from the incredibly romantic to… uh, a little more intense.\" Additionally, new idle animations have been added in the camp to \"help your campsite feel more alive.\" Other gameplay modifications have been added. \n\n\n \n\nThe post Baldur’s Gate 3 rakes in over $90 million for Hasbro appeared first on Destructoid.",

The studio's community manager, Bucky, seems to feel the same if their recent Twitter post is anything to go by. \n\n\nIt's not very often that a game, especially one from a smaller studio, becomes as much of an overnight success as Palworld did. The stories of broken records came thick and fast: millions of players, concurrent player counts, the likes of which are rarely seen, and Pocketpair pumping out the patches to resolve issues as fast as possible. \n\n\nIt's fair to say that Palworld was a phenomenon, and it still is.

          "description": "Petroglyph has announced that the sequel to 2016’s 8-Bit Armies, titled 9-Bit Armies: A Bit Too Far, will release into PC Early Access on February 23.\n\n\nThe use of 8-Bit in describing indie games that use either a voxel or pixel art style has always irked me. It’s less common now, but it was very popular as the retro gamer identity started to take hold. A pet peeve is all. However, Petroglyph has been in my mind since I learned they are still updating 2006’s Star Wars: Empire at War. That kind of love and commitment toward their community is laudable.\n\n\n\n\n9-Bit Armies describes itself as and easy to learn, difficult-to-master real-time strategy game. While I’m not a fan of the voxel art style, it touts two-player cooperative campaigns, maps that are 400% bigger than the original, and naval warfare. You can also build and destroy bridges, which may not sound very exciting, but those structures have extreme strategic importance in real wars often not translated in strategy games.\n\n\nIn terms of its Early Access release, Petroglyph says, “The core game is largely in place, with both factions fully playable and a full campaign to play through.” The goal of Early Access is to open it to a larger player base and collect feedback to improve it on top of just adding content.\n\n\n9-Bit Armies: A Bit Too Far releases on PC Early Access on February 23, 2024.\n\nThe post Petroglyph’s 9-Bit Armies: A Bit Too Far launches into Early Access on February 23 appeared first on Destructoid.",

I’ve actually asked people close to me if they even know the rules, and no one does. Here’s my guess based on reading Life, the Universe and Everything: A guy throws a ball at a wooden block that is held up by three short poles. A guy with a flat cudgel tries to prevent the ball from hitting the structure and knocking the block from the top of it. However, there are a bunch of other guys surrounding this duel, and I have no idea what they do.\n\n\nThat’s my guess at how Cricket is played.\n\n\n\n\nThankfully, it doesn’t look like I need to know the rules for Cricket Through the Ages, a game that celebrates the extensive history of the sport. It seems to be aiming to give a deep dive into the sport and should teach me everything I need to know. It looks like one of those wacky physics-driven games that are intentionally difficult to control. People are throwing things at each other. One of the scenes actually looks like what I think the sport looks like, but they’re playing with a beach ball.\n\n\nIt looks fun. The press release notes it uses a “simple, one-button control scheme.” It has six game modes and can be played by yourself or against your most hated enemy. They also promise that you will, \"learn about the totally real history of cricket. You won’t believe it.\"\n\n\nCricket Through the Ages was previously only available as part of the Apple Arcade service on iOS, but is now coming to real video game devices. It releases on PC and Switch on March 1, 2024.\n\nThe post Devolver published Cricket Through the Ages is coming to PC and Switch March 1 appeared first on Destructoid.",

If you’re unsure who I’m talking about, you’ll undoubtedly know him as Jim Hopper from Stranger Things, but he has had starring roles in everything from blockbuster movies like Hellboy to Theatre plays like Hamlet. And in games, he’s lending his voice as Edward Carnby in the 2024 remake of Alone in the Dark. \n\n\nHarbour is a lifelong gamer, having previously revealed that he plays World of Warcraft, so his Instagram post explaining his love for Last Epoch shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. \n\n\n\n\nWhile disclosing that the post is indeed a hashtag-ad, Harbour goes on to explain his love for Last Epoch, thanking the team at Eleventh Hour for allowing him to collaborate with them on the in-game item. Although he offers no specific details about the item, Harbour concluded the post by promising to share more as soon as he could before encouraging people to buy the game before its release. \n\n\n\n\nEleventh Hour took the time to comment on David’s post, saying “Just like in this post, when we met David we could all feel the genuine passion he had for the game and the collaboration.

Since launch, some players have reported issues with strangers infiltrating their servers, destroying their bases, and even preventing access to servers entirely. \n\n\nPocketpair have today released a statement on Twitter addressing these issues and outlining measures that they plan to introduce to combat cheaters trying to spoil other players enjoyment of the game, stating: “As a company, we do not tolerate any fraudulent activity or cheating, and we are working on measures to deal with it strictly and as a priority.”\n\n\n\n\nThe first measure outlined in the Twitter post is the introduction of a player list on multiplayer servers, allowing players and hosts to identify uninvited players and potentially boot them from the server. The hope is that this will also allow for players to receive suspensions by the development team in the event of dishonorable gameplay. \n\n\nPocketpair are also planning to introduce an ‘external anti-cheat solution’, although they don’t name software or give details as to how this would work, in order to ‘take measures against particularly frequent fraudulent activities and cheating’. They do note that this feature will be optional for those who play on community servers and those who play single player and co-op.\n\n\nThey also noted that while the team try to deal with issues on a daily basis, sometimes there are cases where they are unable to keep up and they apologized for this before going on to say that they’re working hard to get the game back to a state which allows players to enjoy it comfortably.\n\nThe post Pocketpair is working to address cheating on Palworld servers appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Plenty has been said about Destiny 2's many, many ups and downs in the year of Lightfall. Even though Bungie hasn't prepared the strongest of send-offs with the Season of the Wish, better updates are on the way, and Update 7.3.5, in particular, could be an interesting showpiece.\n\n\nMore specifically, Bungie's latest This Week in Destiny blog specifically outlines Update 7.3.5, which is due to launch on March 5, with sandbox changes taking the most of the limelight. Exotics such as the Manticore SMG and the Vex Mythoclast fusion rifle are being (slightly) buffed, for example, and almost every weapon class is getting a tweak of this or that kind. Further, there are big PvP changes in tow, with the nerf to the infamously powerful Threaded Specter Warlock subclass being particularly notable.\n\n\n…",

          "description": "As influential as the original Doom games are, it'd be interesting to know how much they'd stand the ravages of time were it not for modding and unusual ports. It set the building blocks for the FPS genre back in the day, but the fact that people continue to tweak the original formula shows just how much of an impact the series has had these past 30 years.\n\n\nSometimes mods will even incorporate other horror franchises. Take this one that mixed Doom with Friday The 13th. Inspired. Now, here's one for us Alien lovers, in which the iconic Xenomorph creatures have made their way into id Software's classic shooters.\n\n\nImage via SlegInfantryman/ModDB.\n\n\nBrought to us by ModDB user SlegInfantryman, \"Xenomorph Infestation\" is an upcoming mod for both Doom and its sequel featuring a \"fully functioning Xenomorph hive that will grow organically featuring the whole life cycle.\" We can see how the images bring the two ideas together.\n\n\nNow we just need Ripley fighting imps\n\n\nAt the moment, the mod is in alpha stage, with no finalized release date yet. SlegInfantryman has said it's more for testing at this point, but it's available to download as a demo.\n\n\nHere's what they have to say about it in response to a comment on the mod page:\n\n\n\nThis is the alpha version which I was mainly using to test and make sure the Xenomorphs functioned correctly in infesting maps. If you run the Xenomorph infestation.pk3 alongside one of the other pk3 files included, you can watch them take over a map.\n\n\n\n\nIn any case, it's a bit of fun to see them running around like excitable kittens in the world of Doom. There seems to be quite a few of these mods already, which suggests the two franchises are just natural bed fellows.\n\nThe post Xenomorphs in classic Doom? Don’t mind if I do. appeared first on Destructoid.",

According to the item description, Apocalyptic Charades was character locked. \n\n\nThis means that the emote would only be usable by one character associated with the buyer's account, something that left many disappointed, considering the fact that FFXIV allows you to have multiple characters. For $350 dollars, it seems pretty fair to assume it's account-wide.\n\n\nIt wasn’t altogether surprising, though. When the Meister Quality Omega figure was released in 2020, the associated Omega Simulations emote was indeed character locked, so buyers …",

This patch improves the most important feature of the game: kissing.\n\n\nActually, we basically covered the gist of this patch before, but now that it’s out in the wild, we can cut it open and see what’s inside. As I lead with, the biggest addition is a tonne of new kissing animations. Beyond just kissing, the patch notes highlight they’ve “improved” some of the final cinematics to “better reflect the connection between players and their partners.” Ladies.\n\n\nThere are some smaller tweaks as well, but the other big ones for me are improved idle camp animations and better speaker prioritization in dialogue.

          "description": "Last year's Alan Wake 2 was a triumph, not only in the survival horror genre but in AAA gaming in general. Given the high praise, it's no wonder we declared it one of our favorite games of 2023. And for good reason, too.\n\n\nAs well as great reviews all around, the Alan Wake follow-up has also been selling well. According to developer Remedy Entertainment, the long-awaited sequel has sold 1.3 million units, as of February 2024. A post on the developer's website says it's the fastest-selling game the company has ever released \"so far.\"\n\n\n\n\nIndeed, it's not been out for too long, so time will tell how big the game can get in terms of sales, especially once DLC hits. By comparison, Control has sold over four million units since it launched in 2019. However, AW2 has sold \"over 50% more copies and over three times more digital copies in its first two months\" than that.\n\n\nAwards, they keep a-comin'\n\n\nOn top of this, Remedy was proud to announce that Alan Wake 2 recently received the DICE Award for \"Outstanding Achievement in Art Direction.\" That's one more accolade to be thrown on the pile, right next to such wins as \"Critics Choice Award\" at Golden Joystick, \"Best Direction\" and \"Best Narrative\" at The Game Awards 2023, as well as some others.\n\n\nSelling 1.3 million units in just a couple of months is mighty impressive, even if you take into account the fact that the game was launched not long before the holidays.\n\n\nOf course, we also need to consider that Alan Wake 2 is a digital-only release. Whether you agreed with that decision or not, one can't help but wonder how many more could have been sold by now if there was a physical copy available as well.\n\nThe post Alan Wake 2 is Remedy’s fastest-selling game ‘so far’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

Reportedly, the game began development as early as 2013 and spent a few years as an Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag spinoff before turning into Black Flag MMO, before finally emerging as a standalone game announcement in 2017. In the six years since its announcement we've seen teases of it here and there, had chances to play in various betas and alphas, and it even appeared on our cover in 2022. Skull and Bones has been a long time coming, but today everyone is finally able to play it.

They are games that are more than a year old that have been on Xbox and PC for awhile. A couple of the games, Spencer says, are community-driven and service-based games that have reached their full potential on Xbox and PC. They are franchises that Xbox wants to continue to invest in. Two are smaller games that were not built to be platform exclusives. Though he wasn't ready to share the game titles, he did confirm that Starfield and Indiana Jones are not in that group.\nAccording to sources reported by The Verge, it seems the four titles may be Hi-Fi Rush, Pentiment, Sea of Thieves, and Grounded.\nSpencer cushioned everything he said, presumably in expectation of pushback from Xbox fans by saying, “We make every decision with the long term health of Xbox in mind.” He also made sure to remind everyone that Xbox already has games on other platforms, calling out Minecraft in particular. Spencer also briefly touched on the company's decision to lay off over 1900 employees, though offered little in terms of reasonable rationalization.\nBond also mentioned that Xbox is looking forward to and making plans surrounding future hardware and vaguely promised a substantial leap in technical prowess, but offered little in terms of concrete details.\n\n\nThe podcast also confirmed Activision/Blizzard games are coming to Game Pass starting with Diablo IV on March 28 and that we can expect a new Xbox showcase in June.",

          "description": "It’s been three years since EA announced it was making a new college football game after a years-long hiatus. Dubbed EA Sports College Football 25, not much has materialized about the game since its reveal in the way of updates, but the publisher has broken its silence with a new trailer confirming a release window and promising a bigger look at the title in the near future.\nThe video heavily leans into the skepticism fans have expressed over College Football’s existence, proudly expressing, “Yes, the game is real” while showing off snippets of behind-the-scenes development footage. The snazzy video doesn’t do much besides that, but it ends with a promise of a full reveal in May and a summer launch window. \n\n\nEA Sports College Football 25 is being developed by EA Orlando (formerly known as Tiburon), the team behind the Madden games. This will be the first college football game from the publisher since the demise of its NCAA Football series, the last entry of which was released in 2013. The franchise was shelved due to a 2014 federal lawsuit in which the judge ruled that the NCAA’s long-standing rule prohibiting college athletes from being compensated for their in-game likenesses was unlawful. \nWith Name, Image, Likeness (NIL) rules now in place in college sports, players can now be paid for appearing in advertisements or products. That would, of course, include video games. EA Sports struck a deal with OneTeam Partners to broker deals with players to include their NIL in the upcoming game. However, this was met with resistance from school/player licensing agency The Brandr Group last summer, which filed a lawsuit to prevent EA from conducting such deals with OneTeam Partners. Both entities eventually agreed to a settlement in November, dropping the lawsuit (thanks College Football HQ). \nWe don’t know what platforms EA Sports College Football 25 will target, but that answer should hopefully come in May’s larger update.",

Its guardian, Stella, grants Peach the ability to transform and gain powers based on the costumes she dons. Stages take the form of different theater plays with ever-changing sets. \nThe video introduces Figure Skater Peach, which sees her gracefully skating across a winter-themed stage and performing spins to take out enemies. The Dashing Thief costume gives Peach a Carmen Sandiego-esque look and vibe as she uses a retractable grappling hook to zipline and swing across 2D levels while evading security bots. Mermaid Peach grants a siren-like singing voice used in what appears to be a type of musical mini-game. Mighty Peach basically turns the Princess into a Super Sentai-like hero battling aliens using super strength and a jetpack to take out foes mid-air.\n\n\nPrincess Peach: Showtime is coming to Switch on March 22. Nintendo is also launching pink rose-colored Joy-Cons for the occasion.",

While we're no closer to knowing the exact details of the event, we now know the \"where\" and \"when\": the announcement will happen on the official Xbox podcast this Thursday, February 15. The episode will be posted at 12 PM Pacific/3 PM Eastern\nPlease join us for a special edition of the Official Xbox Podcast.\npic.twitter.com/TxwWJVUbgx\nFebruary 12, 2024\nThe podcast in question will feature more than just Xbox head Phil Spencer, however. Sarah Bond and Matt Booty, the Presidents of Xbox and Xbox Game studios, respectively, will also give updates on the future of the brand. \nThere are a few likely candidates for discussion. The most recent is the report that Xbox exclusives would begin coming to other platforms, including Hi-Fi Rush, Starfield, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Speculation around this news has taken many different directions, with some even theorizing that the loss of exclusivity implies Xbox might stop making consoles altogether. A report from earlier today, however, says that this isn't the case.\nThe other topic on the table is the company's most recent round of mass layoffs, where over 1900 employees were let go from the company, and a Blizzard survival game years into development was canceled. While Blizzard and Microsoft have since asserted that the layoffs would have happened with or without their notorious merger, the FTC filed a complaint. Either for gamers, employees, or the regulatory bodies of the world, it's a viable point of discussion.\nWhen the podcast is posted on Thursday, you'll be able to listen to it on Xbox's YouTube channel right here.\nWhat do you think the future of Xbox looks like?

This week I am happy to correct that monumental mistake.\nWe will get back to Majora's Mask soon (Marcus is out on assignment this week) but we took that opportunity to revisit one of, if not the, best PlayStation games with Metal Gear Solid. It just so happens that Alex Van Aken is playing through the game for fun, so I asked him if we could just jump into his save for an hour. And you know what? It just so happened to be one of the best hours of the whole game. Alex takes out Liquid Snake in the HIND, meets the invisible overweight soldiers, and defeats Sniper Wolf. It's a fantastic snapshot of a fantastic game.\n\n\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

          "description": "Whenever a Mario Kart entry arrives, it immediately becomes a must-have on its respective platform, thanks to its universal appeal to gamers of all experience and ability levels. That widespread appeal has translated to sales, as nearly every Mario Kart game ranks near the top of its platform's sales chart. But it goes beyond mainstream success; Mario Kart is fun whether you're spending the evening alone perfecting a drift around a corner or gathering your closest friends for a marathon session. \nSure, the rubberband A.I. and the randomization elements are enough to make us want to jump up and down in frustration, but it's never quite enough to deter us from driving up to the next starting line.

Or if you could recommend it to those who haven’t played it without needing to explain away the parts that haven’t aged well? In today’s gaming landscape, remasters are common, but we’ve seen an influx of full-on remakes of classic role-playing games in recent years.\nWhile 1990’s Ys I & II is likely the earliest example of remade role-playing games, perhaps the most prominent early examples came in the form of the Pokémon franchise. Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen, 2004 remakes of the series’ debut titles less than a decade after their initial release, showcased the technological leap from original Game Boy to Game Boy Advance.

You can see the developer's full statement below.\nAfter 5 years of service, we're hanging up the Dead Cells coat.

It also wrote, \"The good news is that our Dead Cells team have been unleashed to pump their talent into our secret projects, and we'll be revealing what their crazy minds have been coming up with very soon!\" while also wishing luck to Motion Twin's next announced project, Windblown, and teasing perhaps more than one project.\nFor more on Evil Empire, you can read Game Informer's impressions of the Dead Cells: Return to Castelvania DLC.",

Speaking of which, Persona 3 Reload has shot to the head of Atlus's ranking of fastest-selling games, shipping over a million copies worldwide in its first week.\nPersona 3 Reload sold 1,000,000 copies worldwide within its first week, becoming the fastest selling game in ATLUS history! 🎉\npic.twitter.com/C2abDAwCDs\nFebruary 8, 2024\nOriginally released on the PlayStation 2, Persona 3 was the first game in its series to define its modern formula, combining social responsibilities with dungeon crawling and a lengthy, emotional story. It's been re-released multiple times and was even ported to modern consoles last year, but even the upgraded versions don't hold a candle to the mind-bending masterpiece that is Persona 5 Royal. Persona 3 Reload closes that gap, however, introducing overhauled visuals and mechanics to bring the game that started it all up to the level of quality fans of the series have come to expect. If the sales numbers and our glowing review are any indication, the upgrade has been well worth the wait.\nTo put these numbers in context, here are some other games that have recently reached comparable significant milestones: Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth shipped 1 million copies as of Feb 1, Nintendo's quarterly report revealed Tears of the Kingdom has sold 20 million copies, and viral hit Palworld continues to smash record after record.\nHave you checked out Persona 3 Reload yet?

That event officially has a date, and it's April 2.\nFor Funimation subscribers, you will have to go through the process of merging your account before the April 2 date, and, frustratingly, any shows that were outright purchased through Funimation will not transfer to Crunchyroll. Just another reminder that when you purchase digital content, true ownership does not technically exist and you will always be at the mercy of the platform holders when it comes to access.\nCrunchyroll subscribers do not need to make any changes, but the price of the subscription will rise to $100 a year soon. The merger officially going through does mean Crunchyroll will feature more content, but a price increase will always be frustrating.\nAlongside this merger finally completing, Crunchyroll is also entering the video game space as a publisher. It remains to be seen what kind of video tames the anime company will help produce, but you can check out this package it sent over on Game Informer's TikTok account.\nAs a subscriber to both services who somehow has managed to continue to have a need for both (Outlaw Star is curiously currently only available on Funimation) the merger is bittersweet. I embrace the simplicity of one anime streaming service but don't look forward to paying more, and will forever be wary of mergers being a good thing.",

The series officially takes place between the second and third movie and will apparently follow Knuckles (Idris Elba) has he helps Wade (Adam Pally), Tom Wachowski's (James Marsden) bumbling police partner, become a true warrior. The trailer also reveals the antagonist will be played by Rory McCann, who is best known for playing Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane in Game of Thrones, and features a two-thirds Human Giant reunion cameo with Rob Huebel and Paul Scheer. Curiously, they're sitting at an ESPN8 The Ocho desk, a gag born from the 2004 film Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story that eventually became a real thing.\nOther interesting details from the trailer? Jim Carrey does not appear, nor does James Marsden, but both Sonic and Tails appear and are played by film voice actors, Ben Schwarz and Colleen O'Shaughnessey.\n\n\nThe series, simply titled Knuckles, will be six episodes long and begins streaming on April 26 on Paramount+.

          "description": "Project Orion is still a deeply mysterious game. We know it is a follow-up to Cyberpunk 2077, we know CD Projekt Red is developing the game in North America (Boston, specifically) as opposed to Poland where the main studio is based, and eventually development will expand to Vancouver, with support from the main Polish headquarters. Beyond those details, we don't know much. Implications from CD Projekt point to it being a sequel, but it could be a spin-off, or something entirely different. Of note, Project Orion was a study from the 50s and 60s about the viability of nuclear power for space travel. Maybe that's what CD Projekt's Cyberpunk 2077 follow-up will be about.\nWe may not know much about the game, but based on a press release from CD Projekt this morning, we now know some of the folks who will be working on it. Dan Hernberg is now a Project Orion executive producer who was head of production at Amazon Games, and also has history at Panic Button and Blizzard Entertainment.  Ryan Barnard was a game director at Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft, but perhaps most notably, was the gameplay director at Hitman for developer IO Interactive. Barnard is joining Project Orion as a design director. Alan Villani is now an engineering director on Project Orion and worked on several Mortal Kombat titles. Anna Megill is a Project Orion lead writer with history on titles like Control, Dishonored: Death of The Outsider, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Guild Wars 2, and the upcoming Fable from Playground Games. Alexander Freed is an additional writer on Project Orion and is a New York Times bestselling novelist and comic book writer who previously worked at Bioware on Star Wars: The Old Republic and more.\nWe're eager to learn more about Project Orion, but suspect it will be some time before we do.

          "description": "Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is one of the biggest Xbox exclusives on the horizon. According to a new report, however, Microsoft might be thinking of bringing Indy to other platforms.\nThe Verge has spoken to an insider familiar with Microsoft’s plans who claims the publisher is considering the idea of bringing several first-party titles to other consoles, like releasing Indiana Jones on the PlayStation 5. The source claims that Bethesda is tentatively targeting a December release for the title and that it will launch as an Xbox/PC title before possibly coming to PlayStation 5 after a short exclusivity window. \n\n\nRemember that nothing has been officially announced or confirmed, so take this report with a grain of salt. It’s worth noting, though, that during Microsoft’s trial with the FTC over its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Bethesda’s then head of publishing, Pete Hines, testified that parent company ZeniMax had initially signed an agreement with Disney to make Indiana Jones a multiplatform game. Microsoft later amended this deal to make the game an Xbox exclusive after it acquired ZeniMax in 2020, with Hines explaining the decision was made in the name of \"reducing risk and trying to get a degree of clarity.\"\nMicrosoft’s rumored multi-platform approach has garnered plenty of speculation in recent months. The publisher is reportedly looking to bring first-party games like Hi-Fi Rush and Sea of Thieves to rival platforms in the near future. Starfield is also rumored for a PS5 launch, as reported by XboxEra. \nIndiana Jones and the Great Circle was first announced in 2021 and had its full reveal during the Xbox Developer Direct last month. The first-person action-adventure romp stars Troy Baker as Indy in a story set between Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade. The game is slated to launch sometime this year for Xbox Series X/S and PC. \n[Source: The Verge]",

Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.\nJoin Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

The pixel-art OpenTTD fonts are iconic, but were designed for 640x480 CRT monitors rather than today’s 4k monsters. Without the horizontal smoothing of CRT scanlines, modern pixel-perfect rendering and 2x or 4x upscaling of the old bitmap/sprite-based fonts makes the text jagged and hard to read.",

In the upcoming weeks we will share more posts explaining some of these features in depth. For now, we need your help testing our work. We need as many people as possible to test this beta version of the 14.X release series, so you can find and we can squash as many bugs as possible before the actual release. To guide you a bit towards what you should be looking for: Generic gameplay bugs and crashes. There is a new Ship Pathfinder; test it out. Buoys are optional to use. You can now automatically unbunch your vehicles at a depot. We added our own interpretation of daylength to the game. More on this soon in another blog post. There are many GUI improvements throughout the game. More consistent look, better GUI scaling. There are many more things worth talking about, and this will be made more clear when we approach the release of 14.0. But for now, play the game, and please report any issues you find. The usual titlegame competition has also been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker",

Powered by Firebase, it's the fastest and easiest way to test your app against real devices, including the Google Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, select Samsung devices, and more.\n\nAfter connecting to a device, you can deploy your app, view the display, interact with the device (including rotating or unfolding the device), and anything else you might do with a device over a direct ADB over SSL connection—all without leaving Android Studio. When you're done using the device, Google wipes all your data and factory resets the device before making it available to another developer.\nDuring Open Alpha, you can use Device Streaming at no cost. To get started simply sign into your Developer account from Android Studio and select a Firebase project. If you don't already have a Firebase project, it's easy to create one.
