And while we're still waiting for a specific release date, hands-on previews for the game have dropped and given us some new information.\nOne of the coolest features of the game was highlighted in PlayStation Blog's impressions — a customisable soundtrack that harks back to Sakaguchi and composer Nobuo Uematsu's past.

          "description": "Wario would be proud.\nNintendo’s Wario Land series has always occupied a unique niche in the company’s extensive catalogue with its weird humour and unconventional approach to platforming tropes, which is why fans have been greatly let down by the fact that there hasn’t been a new entry in over 15 years. To fill the gap, an indie team called Tour De Pizza came out early last year with its own spiritual successor called Pizza Tower, offering a polished and thrilling adventure into a truly insane food-themed world. Since release, Pizza Tower has quickly built up a high reputation for its creativity and gameplay design, and now that it’s come to Switch, we’re pleased to report that it is indeed a fantastic platformer.\nPizza Tower places you in the role of Peppino Spaghetti, the chef and owner of a failing pizzeria who finds himself threatened by an evil sentient pizza named Pizzaface who lives nearby in the titular tower.

He drops in every now and again, does his job, then disappears for weeks, sometimes months at a time. Later on, you'll find out some cool tidbit of information – he was in Europe doing Important Lawyer Things, or chasing an Interpol lead in the deep jungle, or on a space station solving an extraterrestrial murder – and then he turns up once more at your doorstep with a cool new outfit like nothing happened. Ace Attorney Investigations is like putting a webcam on said cat to find out what he gets up to – and it turns out that most of Edgeworth's out-of-court activities involve solving murders before they even get to court.\nThe first game in this double-pack is Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth, which came out back in 2009 on the DS as a spin-off to the main series. It's set between the events of the third game, Trials and Tribulations, and the fourth game, Apollo Justice, and – we'll be honest – players will benefit from a pretty robust knowledge of (at least) the events of the first trilogy.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

While it wasn't outstanding in the grander landscape of gaming, enough Warhammer 40K fans seem to have cherished the escapades of bulky blue boltgunner Demetrian Titus for the action game to merit a sequel a decade later. It left its story on something of a cliffhanger, with said hero being dragged away to face untold tortures by the Inquisition, the most zealous sect of this preternaturally paranoid sci-fi universe. Today, Titus is free again. Free to stomp towards hordes of alien foes, blast them with a plasma incinerator, and shred the stragglers with a chainsaw sword. Space Marine 2 is an often-satisfying scrapper that has me  convinced of 40K's merit as a crafting ground for excellent-looking environments and creatures, even if I'm not particularly moved by the bland character of Titus and his fellow Ultramarines.\nRead more",

Snuck out over winter 2022, it was a sombre but delightful freebie with immense though well-hidden imagination, in which your only explicit objective was to find a way out of a small concrete city.\nNow, developers Lemaitre Bros are making a gott-dang 1v1 FPS called Straftat, slated for release on 24th October 2024 with over 100 arenas. It's similarly in love with concrete, but it also has blunderbusses, dual-wielding, Gatling guns, corner-peeking, curved swords, cowboy hats and beehive hairdos.\nRead more",

Out on 16th September, it's a pixelart charmer that \"combines elements of puzzle games, roguelites and deckbuilders\", much as you'd combine a red circle and two golden triangles to spark a lightning bolt.\n Read more",

          "description": "In the first post for my series on \"saving\" open world design, I complained that many of today's open worlds feel like checklists of formulaic tasks and rewards, their geography a vaporous staging ground for itemisable, cycling content-gathering opportunities, which flies in the face of the sense of freedom and wonder they're supposed to inspire. My interviewees, Elder Scrolls veterans Matt Firor and Nate Purkeypile, argued that this reflects the expense and scale of today's open world productions, which constrains experimental design both at a practical level and in terms of overall direction.\nCD Projekt open world designer Jakub Tomczak doesn't, as far as I know, have an answer to the issue of production bloat, but he does have a disarmingly obvious solution to the 'checklist problem', based on his time creating missions for Cyberpunk 2077 and its Phantom Liberty expansion: get better at hiding the checklist. Weave it into the landscape and setting more artfully, with an elegant balance of randomisation and responsiveness to the player's behaviour which keeps everything fresh. \r\n\n \nRead more",

It was a copy of The Game of Life, possibly the least exciting board game a child can win.\nThe game was dog water, and there’s probably a lesson in there somewhere about how cool and good it is to whine until you get free things, but we don’t have time for that. Instead, I’d like to draw your attention to Floops Big House Adventure. It’s a grungy, slimy, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters meets Ren and Stimpy Saturday morning shooter.

It blew the dust from my synapses.\nThe same appears true of King-Spooner's upcoming Judero, on which he is collaborating with Soul Searching developer Talha Kaya. It casts you as a \"pagan seer\" armed with a big stick, who is searching the mythical Scottish borderlands for evil creatures to clobber. It looks cheerier and airier than Sluggish Morss, with a more overt emphasis on mechanics such as combat, but it has the same pickled 3am energy to it.

Until the next time I have to write about Andrew Wilson.\n“Oil just use my trusty knoife” mutters Sid as I take down my first guard. Straight away, the animation and noise indicators evoke the same Shadow Tactics or Desperados III goodness you’re probably expecting. Fine with me - that’s exactly what I’m here for.

          "description": "Stormgate is a confusing proposition. It's an RTS directed by former Blizzard developers that is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike StarCraft. It's a free-to-play game, but has a business model that makes you feel like you're getting a rougher deal than if you just dropped thirty notes for it outright. It's available now in Early Access, but has already been available in a kind of gravity-defying Super Early Access for several weeks (which you had to pay to get into).\r\n\n\r\nAll of which has made me feel very tired, and yearn for the days when you went into a shop and bought a game in a box for a set amount of money, and the whole game was in the box and you went home and put it on your PC and played it until your mum said \"Richard!\" (only my mum calls me Richard) \"get off that computer and go outside and get some exercise! Do you want to be dead at 35?\" Well, I'm 36 now mum. Nearly 37. So who's laughing through their heart palpitations now?\r\n\n \nRead more",

While it would be a monumentally silly heel turn to go back on their promise of only charging Space Marine 2 players extra for cosmetics a mere week and change before the shooter’s September 9 release date,  the new year one roadmap does at least look piously forthright.\nChatting to James at Gamescom recently (possibly from his cathedral ship made out of graphics cards), Saber boss Tim Willits dragged out an armoured horse and proceeded to flog it mercilessly, saying that players don’t want to be sold the equivalent of Oblivion's infamous deadbeat daddy of DLCs. As several of you identified, this seemed like an odd comparison when Spice Maureen 2 specifically plans to charge for comparable cosmetics, although I imagine Willits was referencing the “packs” that his space game’s baubles come in. “Our fans never thought we ripped them off in World War Z,” he said, comparing Space Marine 2’s optional spendables to that game.\nWhether you see the cosmetic's pricing as egregious or not, yesterday’s roadmap does look to make good on Saber’s promise to keep wearables and playables separate.

          "description": "Almost a decade after his acrimonious departure from Konami, the shadow of Hideo Kojima still looms over Metal Gear Solid. He's there, barely camouflaged, in the undergrowth of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - a remake of the fifth Metal Gear game, originally released in 2004, which tells the tale of a lone US special operator hunting superweapons and old mentors in the jungles of the southern Soviet Union. \r\n\n\r\nI say \"remake\" but this feels more like a re-release, in spirit. True, it now runs on Unreal Engine, with the option of a manual, third-person perspective and cover-shooter controls in addition to the old top-down viewpoints. Yes, it boasts new flourishes, such as wounds now leaving scars, and clothes picking up stray leaves. Yes, there's a new interface with floating in-world menus, which makes shuffling between the layers a bit less awkward. It's the product of much labour, with development split between Konami and external support partner Virtuos. But where Konami's other big restoration project, Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake, is a creative dialogue with the original game, Delta seems consumed by faithfulness to Kojima's original design.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's also a free-to-play game, and I have the usual unanswered questions about currencies and gacha, but I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt for the minute, because I have not spent nearly enough of my life considering the tactical applications of ballgowns.

(It came out in 1997, and as such, I think the statute of limitations on spoilers has passed, but if you still intend to play, stop reading now.) The mission completes the long arc of foreshadowing begun by the intro's mention that capital-class spacecraft have been outlawed, following a ruinous war. It turns out that one particular evil corpo has been sneakily building one of these megaships - not only that, but you get to fly inside it, cannons ablazing. It was while doing so that teenage me realised the true exceptionality of the Video Game Artform. You can't fly inside capital ships in, like, symbolist poems or baroque symphonies, can you? You can't fly in poems or symphonies at all, unless you do so metaphorically - \"metaphor\" being a kind of poor man's graphics card.\nThe technology of flight simming has advanced mightily since G-Police's day. For instance: in Everspace 2's just-announced Titans DLC, you get to fly inside not just regular old spaceships, but massive space kaiju with procedurally generated digestive systems.

You can, quite literally, go on tours curated by historians around each of the game's respective maps. Instead of diving off a Sphinx and plunging your hidden blade into someone's spinal column, you can look up at the Sphinx and read a paragraph on its significance. Maybe view an actual, real life bit of ancient Egypt from an actual real life museum collection in-game. Perhaps embody an Anglo-Saxon lad in Valhalla, instead, and like, cook up some nettle soup having just got a fresh \"Friar Tuck\" at the local hair choppers (no guarantees on this last bit).\nThis is all to say that Black Myth: Wukong deserves such a mode, too. There were so many times throughout my review time where I stopped and stared and wondered as to something's meaning. Not only in the architecture, but in the characters, too. So here I am with a proposition: how about instead of thwacking things with my staff, I can use it as a walking stick and point it at things I want to learn about.\nRead more",

It's a machinegun montage of comicbook panels and sizzling melee arcs and quips like \"there's a lot of wankers between you and the sweet taste of freedom\".

Yes, with SteamWorld Heist 2, they're revisiting the sci-fi bullet-bouncing of their 2016 tactics game SteamWorld Heist, but they're also introducing significant changes to create a compulsive XCOM-like full of sea-faring submariners that may be their best work yet, even against a back catalogue of blinders. \nRead more",

Mind you, I tend to play games with my nose about 10 centimetres from the screen. Forget being flanked - it's the prospect of snipers up ahead I'm worried about.\nIf you're among the people who fret excessively about flankers, I've got great news from Uncle BioWare. Forthcoming RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard will support 21:9 ultrawide monitors. The ultrawide functionality extends to cinematics - you can disable \"cinematic aspect ratios\" to switch off the black bars that otherwise hem in the view.

Yes, yes, it is the unmistakable rumble of a large survival MMO pondering its release date. Dune: Awakening is having a think and has decided \"early 2025\" is a good non-specific time period to come out in early access. That could mean January or February. Or March, I guess. April? Now don't be silly, that's spring. Not April, surely. This beast seems hungry. It will eat before then. I have foreseen it. Mostly by watching the trailer that dropped at Gamescom.\nRead more",

It’s just actor Troy Baker telling me about all the great acting he’ll be doing. It is great, by the way. He’s doing a fantastic job. Maybe just, you know, a crumb of acknowledgement or elucidation over the whole ‘interactivity’ part?\nAnyway, don’t mind me. I’m just an old fool who likes to press buttons.

So much so, in fact, that I’d assumed the trailer I watched during an online preview event last week was for a new entry in the horror cinematic-platformer series, right up until the name Reanimal appeared on the screen - shortly followed by a snippet of voiced dialogue.\nIt’s not just the horror setting, but the Grimm’s fairytale threat, the distorted adults-made-monsters through the trauma-tinged lens of a child’s imagination. A long-limbed man riding a bicycle in a threadbare suit chases children down an alley. A gangly, bowler-hatted pursuer scuttles down a long table like a spider. It's familiar enough territory, at least at first glance. But when Tarsier have a body of work subconsciously scarred by phantasms this vivid, recurring nightmares are just as potent.\nRead more",

          "description": "Ač to podle počasí nevypadá, prázdniny skončily. Nesmutněte však, neboť již tento čtvrtek bude Virtuální Bastlírna - setkání elektroniků, bastlířů, ajťáků a všech milovníků techniky! Jaké novinky a témata tam čekají? Nový procesor na trhu zpravidla vzruší jen uživatele PC, největší novinka tohoto měsíce se týká spíše bastlířů. Raspberry vydalo nový procesor RP2350, který je výrazným vylepšením původního RP2040. Kromě Arm Cortex M33 jader skrývá také RISC-V jádra a značné množství zajímavých digitálních periferií. Ač oficiální desky ještě nejsou dostupné, samozřejmě se strahovákům procesor i tak dostal do rukou a možná i do hledáčku elektronových mikroskopů. A poví si i proč má nový Bus Pirate s tímto procesorem lehké trable a jaké zajímavosti se nachází v erratě procesoru.\r\n\r\nTím samozřejmě novinky nekončí - ještě se bastlíři zmíní o novém nativním konfiguračním nástroji pro síťové prvky od Mikrotiku a o podpoře jednovrstvých plošných spojů v Altiu. Protože jsou ale bastlíři, nezapomenou i na čistě hardwarová témata.\r\n\r\nZe světa hardwaru ukáží nejen novinky nebo praktické poznatky ohledně minimalistických sad nářadí, které se dají vždy nosit s sebou, ale i pár lehce \"retro\" projektů. Vznikla například replika klávesnice k počítači Ondra a ke starým osciloskopům se dá v současnosti koupit emulátor disketové mechaniky, který používá standardní USB flash disky.\r\n\r\nA jak je zvykem, mají strahováci nachystaná i obskurní až bizarní témata, kupříkladu simulátor 555 na Attiny, čínské klony karet MIFARE Classic s nedokumentovaným backdoorem nebo velice osobité útržky z legendární knihy Rozeberte si PC.\r\n\r\nPříští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve čtvrtek 5. září od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

No launch date has been announced.\n\n\nThere seem to be a lot of courier games on the horizon, but this is strangely a concept I really enjoy. The trailer starts off normally enough, highlighting the ‘50s theme (they strangely pin it specifically in 1959). There are slow pans, people doing stuff, and a car chase. Then it gets to the actual gameplay, and the player character has a giant marlin in the back of his truck.\n\n\n\n\nDelivery can be fun in a mundane setting, but it can be even better when it leans wackier. Crazy Taxi is just a delivery game when you get down to it. Deliver At All Costs certainly isn’t aiming for realism. The trailer makes a big show of its destruction physics as the truck plows through fences and even buildings. People hang from the sides of the truck in one scene, and in another, the player climbs a steep, treacherous road as boulders tumble onto them.\n\n\nIt looks like a good time. While the high, tilted camera angle isn’t my favorite, it looks like it works for the approach. The trailer already shows off quite a bit of variety in its missions, and there seems to be an underlying narrative serving as a foundation for the chaos.\n\n\nWe’ll see how well Far Out Games can pull it off when Deliver At All Costs comes to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC sometime in the future.\n\nThe post Deliver At All Costs looks like it will deliver on its promise appeared first on Destructoid.",

Epic Games is set to release a v31.10 update which will bring new content to the game, including more Marvel skins to obtain. \n\n\n\n\nNew Fortnite Super Styles featuring Captain America and Emma Frost among others are already confirmed for the next update. The Black Cat Fortnite skin features Felicia Hardy in her classic attire, and the reported outfit bundle comes with a Black Cat themed pickaxe, backpack, and guitar. There is also said to be a Black Cat skin coming to LEGO Fortnite too with the upcoming update.\n\n\nWhile Black Cat and other skins may have been spotted, that does not necessarily mean that the outfits will be available as soon as the new update drops. Epic Games usually rolls out new skins through rotation of items in the shop, instead of releasing all of these together. As for Black Cat, the expected release date is September 14-15.\n\n\n\n\nBlack Cat skin in Fortnite is likely to cost around 2,000 V-Bucks based on the pricing for the Deadpool skin, but there is no set category for pricing by Epic Games, with skins also costing 2,400 V-Bucks (Lewis Hamilton skin) sometimes. The Black Cat Fortnite outfit bundle is going to cost somewhere around 3,000-5,000 V-Bucks.\n\n\nFortnite v31.10 update: What to expect\n\n\nFortnite is down at the time of writing, undergoing maintenance for the upcoming update. New files are being added to the game, and hence, new leaks are coming out. Leaks suggest the Infinity Gauntlet mythic weapon has been added back to Fortnite. It's also been claimed (via ShiinaBR on X) that a Doctor Doom Loot Island will be coming to the game, alongside a new Doctor Doom outfit called Pandora's Armor Doom. \n\n\n\nThe post Black Cat Fortnite skin reportedly releasing with v31.10 update appeared first on Destructoid.",

If you are trying to log in, and wondering if Fortnite is down and when will Fortnite servers be back up, the downtime is due to the planned maintenance for the v31.10 update.\n\n\n\n\nEpic Games has announced that the game will undergo maintenance at 4 a.m. ET / 1 a.m. PT on September 4, 2024. As usual, matchmaking will be turned off shortly before maintenance kicks off. Fortnite v31.10 is expected to be released roughly 3-4 hours after the downtime commences, based on previous time gaps between Fortnite downtime and update release.\n\n\nThe upcoming update is already poised to introduce new Fortnite Super Level styles for various existing outfits in the game, such as Captain America and Emma Frost. The Fortnite Super Level styles are typically unlocked once players progress past level 100 in the ongoing battle pass. \n\n\n\n\nThere have been several rumours surrounding the upcoming update, with players expecting Sabretooth Meowscles skin to arrive. For those unfamiliar, Meowscles is an original Fortnite skin, which is said to receive a variant skin in which Meowscles is also Sabretooth, the brother of Wolverine from Marvel Comics.\n\n\nSpeaking of Marvel, Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 4 is themed after Marvel superheroes, and with a special focus on Doctor Doom, a major villain in Marvel Comics.

          "description": "The latest update for World of Stands added some new Stands and reworked a lot of the balance around existing ones. In fact, Update 3 added three new Stands, one of each rarity, that has really shaken up the meta. We've put together this extensive World of Stands Tier List for all Stands to know which of the 17 you should strive for.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoiid\n\n\nWorld of Stands Tier List for all Stands\n\n\nWith 17 total Stands in World of Stands, there is a lot of variety and disparity in terms of balance between all of them. Typically speaking, Stands of higher rarity—there are currently three rarities, Common, Rare, and Legendary—are the stronger options. However, at each rarity, there are better Stands than others, and the rarity alone does not guarantee a specific level of strength.\n\n\nStands we've put in the S Tier are currently in the best spot and should be the ones you are striving for as soon as possible. Those in the A Tier are also strong options and can be used without issue until you're able to get your hands on a Stand in the S Tier. The Stands in the B Tier may have specific situations in which they shine and can be used until you find a Stand in the S or A Tier. Finally, the Stands in the C Tier are a bit lacking at the moment, which is understandable as they are all of Common rarity. As such, you should try to replace them as soon as possible.\n\n\nHere is our World of Stands Tier List for all Stands as of Update 3:\n\n\nS Tier\n\n\n\nAnubis Chariot (Legendary)\n\n\nKiller Queen (Legendary)\n\n\nKing Crimson (Legendary)\n\n\nStar Platinum (Legendary)\n\n\nThe World (Legendary)\n\n\n\nA Tier\n\n\n\nCrazy Diamond (Legendary)\n\n\nGold Experience (Legendary)\n\n\nMagician's Red (Rare)\n\n\nSilver Chariot (Rare)\n\n\nWeather Report (Rare)\n\n\n\nB Tier\n\n\n\nAnubis (Common)\n\n\nDeath 13 (Common)\n\n\nSticky Report (Rare)\n\n\nThe Sun (Common)\n\n\n\nC Tier\n\n\n\nThe Hand (Common)\n\n\nRed Hot Chili Pepper (Common)\n\n\nEchoes (Common)\n\n\nThe post World of Stands Tier List appeared first on Destructoid.",
