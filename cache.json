Between rising desktop component prices and ever-ballooning electricity bills, it would make sense that a smaller, cheaper system would take on a new appeal, and the success of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally show that convenience still trumps out-and-out performance for a lot of PC players. There have even been hints that Valve are resurrecting their Steam Machine mini PC concept, years after a flopping first attempt. Should you be interested?\nRead more",

Its structure most resembles Songs of Conquest or Heroes of Might and/or Magic, but with little RPG emphasis or base building, and minimal tactical fighting.\nTaxonomy is arbitrary and often unimportant at the end of the day, but I am very glad to firmly rule it out of one category: It's not a bloody card game. It looks like one, sure. You do most things with cards, and characters acquire more cards over time.

          "description": "At any given moment I am in the center of a wonderful vortex of skeletons. Bones splash and rattle and burst out of the ground in sharp, horrible spurs. My weakest skeletons, sensing their death coming, explode into fire and shards. My strongest skeletons fight so hard and with such alacrity that upon dying, they drag their spirits together and keep fighting as ghosts for a while. Foul little bone scorpions skitter around on fans of legs made from human hands. Somewhere in the middle, almost invisible among the noise, is the character I am actually playing: Path of Exile 2’s mean-spirited, callous, and gleefully enjoyable Witch.\nThis is a review in progress. It has to be. Even in its incomplete early access period, Path of Exile 2 is a great sprawling mass of a game. Three meaty acts of a planned six act campaign are followed by a trickier return tour through them, before the absurd endgame kicks into gear and the real work begins. If I came to you having played everything on offer I would be wild-haired, bloodshot-eyed and possessing perfect, incomprehensible knowledge. Let’s compromise: I have toured the dark caverns and the antediluvian crypts. I have been killed by various accumulated nasties. I’ve had a great time.\nRead more",

          "description": "The announcement of The Witcher 4 with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's Ciri as protagonist has attracted a bit of discussion. Some of the reaction is online toddlers waxing wroth about a video game having a (somewhat older!!!) woman as lead character, and especially, shock, a video game in a series that has hitherto starred a man. And some of it is people commenting more thoughtfully on whether Ciri genuinely makes for a suitable Witcher protagonist, given that she isn't the product of the typical Witcher genetic modification regime (which is heavily tailored towards men), and given that, without spoiling too much, she has gifts that make crumbly old Geralt's sword-and-sorcery skillset look rather paltry. \r\n\n\nSpeaking to Eurogamer this week, game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber responded to a few of these comments, and also shared a little about Ciri's situation at the start of the game.\r\n \nRead more",

We spoke in his home village at dawn. Later, I examined the senator's personal history more thoroughly and discovered he was \"hated by bears for cooking them a rancid meal.\" I suppose every politician has their enemies. \nThat Caves Of Qud creates fun anecdotes out of simple encounters shouldn't be a surprise. It has had 15 years of early access to establish itself as a small-but-mighty story generating roguelike of repute (there's a reason it sits deservedly side-by-side with Dwarf Fortress in the same publishing house). After creating many characters, and dying and dying and dying again, I understand why it grips the brain with such fierce glee. It is a machine of grand imagination and adventuresome comedy. A deceptively powerful RPG that isn't half as obtuse to newcomers as the screenshots make it out to be. Qud's low-res bark is just a complement to its bite.\nRead more",

Lit by gaslamps that can’t quite dispel the industrial haze, they pass for a civilian - a rough one, admittedly, but not shady enough to cause an itch in the swordarm of any passing guard.\nUntil, that is, they take to the thieves’ highway - following the trajectory of their grappling hook upward to the rooftops, from which they can see the shape of the city, and the moon beyond. Up here, it’s a parallel world - the trees on street level answered by chimney stacks, and the distant hills echoed by the rise and fall of steep gables. “We’re super proud of these rooftops,” says Greg LoPiccolo. “It’s an amazing landscape that we put a lot of thought and effort into, and it’s a lot of fun to traverse.”\nBack in 1998, LoPiccolo was the game director who saw Thief: The Dark Project to completion. Today - after an 18 year detour to Harmonix to lead projects like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, among other adventures - he’s the game director of Thick as Thieves. “It really is an opportunity to do something unique and cool and new, on the shoulders of this stuff that is now well-respected,” he says. “Thief has some legs, right? People still talk about it to some degree.”\nRead more",

Fights are like if you took a MOBA and forced both teams to bash heads constantly. Success lies in picking off Spider-Man or Squirrel Girl or Marcus Fenix so as they wait to respawn, you hop on the big area that needs capturing. Or you push the cart while tanky Hulk absorbs bullets with his biceps and John Marvel snipes from afar.\nThe more I played Rivals, though, the more it hit me that it's specifically a messier, more complex Overwatch. A hero shooter with a surprising amount of polish and charm, sure, but also one that slides off my brain like water off Birdman's back. I understand why it's supremely popular at the moment and yet, I really don't.\nRead more",

          "description": "In more ways than one, today’s Total War: Warhammer 3 expansion marks a milestone for game director Rich Aldridge and his team at Creative Assembly. Omens Of Destruction’s three headline legendary lords each bring new campaigns and units for their respective factions, but it’s the fourth lord - a Khorne champion free to all players - that I imagine Aldridge will end up remembering the most fondly.\nWhen Total War: Warhammer released back in 2016, it shipped with eight legendary lords - famous characters from Games Workshop’s fantasy setting that here act as faction leaders. The number grew steadily and, in terms of announcement order at least, today’s addition of Arbaal The Undefeated marks the series’ 100th. That's a hundred campaigns, a hundred joint efforts of game design, animation, art, writing and voice work.\nAldridge has never been shy about the team’s ambition for the series to eventually offer up each unit from every Fantasy Battle 6th edition army book (\"The goal is to do everything, right?\"). But ambition is one thing, and considering the fraught conditions at Creative Assembly and parent company Sega over the past few years, it’s not just the addition of the 100th lord that feels like something to celebrate. It’s taken time, effort, and a siesmic shift in update frequency, but Total War: Warhammer III is in the best place it's ever been.\nRead more",

It seems to play a bit like XCOM, with an oppressive world map that is slowly encroached upon as you travel around recruiting soldiers, interacting with settlements, and picking real-time fights with hellfiends \"inspired by biblical descriptions and European folklore\". Naturally, parallels with real-life xenophobia and sectarian hatred abound. Here's the trailer.\n Read more",

But the platform is testing a new option in the beta client, which lets you set download behaviour to git new gigs only when you actually launch a game. This would be a terrible curse, for reasons I will explain, but it's only going to be an option - not the new default.\nRead more",

          "description": "While it’s always worth starting a new game of Cyberpunk 2077 just to hear Judy say \"his own choomba shot him!\" for the thirtieth time, there’s now a slightly more tangible reason to start a new journey into Night City’s open world. Update 2.2 went live yesterday, bringing with it a host of fixes, as well as some deeper customisation options for both your character and vehicles. The base game is also 55% off on Steam until the 18th of December, with the Phantom Liberty expansion at 20% off, or both in a 48% off bundle. Cyberpunk is on sale often enough, although these current discounts line up with the cheapest it's ever been on Steam. Again: worth it for the line.\nRead more",

These minimalist or slight experiences set their stall against the mainstream philosophy of video game design focused on action, rules, clear progression, and often violence. So it is with Naiad, a sometimes pleasant swim down a river in which you sing to make flowers grow and discover poems by interacting with birds, bees, butterflies and other fauna. \r\n\nYet here's the cause of my pity. All those other games, with their decisive action, systemic consequence, and neck-snapping: I was playing those to relax, too. Why else would I have snapped all those necks? Being shorn of base pleasures does not make Naiad a restorative oasis amid a desert of stressful video games, and it doesn't make it more relaxing than its peers. In fact, it makes for an experience that left me restless, even a little anxious, when it made me feel anything at all.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's currently fourth on the Steam daily most played, right between Path Of Exile 2 and the evergreen Grand Theft Auto 5. I think there are three reasons for this enthusiasm: 1) it's free-to-play with the usual comet's tail of microtransactables 2) it's third-person Overwatch with Marvel characters, a straightforwardly enticing licensing sandwich, and 3) people want to have sex with a larger-than-usual proportion of the cast and especially awful tongue-monster Venom, who has a good butt in this one. No, I'm not going to share pictures. You'll have to google that filth yourself.\r\n\n\r\nBut perhaps you are a sophisticated soul who has no time for such salacious nonsense. You're more interested in hearing how they're patching the thing. Enough with the butts already, dang it - this is a new multiplayer game so there must, of course, be patches!

It's like offering somebody a cake that is actually a cunningly painted hunk of torpedo fuselage. It's like offering to shake hands while wearing one of those comedy hand buzzers - except that the hand buzzer is an intricate simulation of zero-G physics, missile behaviours and comms jamming, featuring spacecraft with proper internal layouts that require you to think hard about attitude control if you don't want, say, your engines to become Swiss cheese about 90 seconds before you need to retreat from combat. \r\n\n\r\nBeing a \"true\" 3D real-time space strategy game, Nebulous looks and sounds a lot like Homeworld on the surface, but it's nothing like as straightforward. It is systems within systems. It is a game in which you can, theoretically, plot the path of a single guided munition through an asteroid field, so as to catch an enemy cruiser in the back. I barely understand how to make a ship fire on another ship, using plain old armour-piercing shells, and now they're threatening to add carriers, fighters and bombers. Customisable ones!

Descending into Gatwick’s cloying brown from 33,000 feet is like flying under and up Gandalf’s wretched cloak and landing in one of the several horrible little magic pouches he keeps by his balls.\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator 2024 captures Gatwick’s brown perfectly.

          "description": "In the Warframe 1999 quest, there comes a time when you will have to decide who’s on point. Right before the buildup to the initial end of the quest, you’ll control someone other than Arthur, but who will it be?\n\n\nWho should you pick during the “Who’s on point” choice in Warframe 1999?\n\n\nIn this scenario, you’ll choose between Arthur, Aoi, Amir, and Lettie. Each of them will have their own loadouts and passive dialogue. The other two, Quincy and Eleanor, are absent in this part due to other things that happened (trying to avoid spoilers).\n\n\nWith the four choices, here is the loadout for each:\n\n\nArthur\n\n\n\nAx-52 \n\n\nVesper 77\n\n\nSkana\n\n\n\nAoi\n\n\n\nBurston\n\n\nProtokol Hira\n\n\nBo\n\n\n\nAmir\n\n\n\nAmprex\n\n\nProtokol Vesek\n\n\nLacera\n\n\n\nLettie\n\n\n\nLatron\n\n\nProtokol 95\n\n\nDual Kamas\n\n\n\nThis part of the quest can be beaten with any of the characters chosen. It all really boils down to which loadout you like best. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nPersonally, I found Amir to be the “best” choice here just because his loadout has the most AoE potential. You’ll be facing a swarm of Techrot enemies, and his Amprex alone can mow down these enemies with ease. Not to mention, his Lacera has the best DPS, attack pattern, and reach compared to all the other Hex members’ melee weapons. \n\n\nHis ability kit is Volt’s, too, so he can speed things up and decimate crowds with his Discharge ability. Honestly, if you want to get through the quest faster to get to the bounty stuff, just pick Amir.\n\n\nIs there a difference on who’s on point?\n\n\nThere is no difference or loss in who you pick for this particular part of the quest. In true Warframe fashion, the dialogue and some things will be spiritually different, but the outcome will always be the same. \n\n\nIn the end, once you get past the Techrot section, you’ll eventually get to the Legacyte part of the quest, where you’ll play as Eleanor. \n\nThe post Warframe 1999 who’s on point?

So, if you want to get your hands on a free Snoop Dogg skin in Fortnite, check below.\n\n\nHow to get the free Snoop Dogg skin in Fortnite\n\n\nTo get the free Snoop Dogg skin in Fortnite, you have to open the gifts in the Winterfest Lodge area from the main menu. One of the gifts will contain the Santa Dogg outfit, which is Snoop Dogg dressed up in a Santa outfit.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the skin is not available at this time. There are other gifts you can open to get free holiday-themed items usable in the Battle Royale and other modes.\n\n\nThis skin is separate from all the other skins Snoop Dogg has had so far. Those include the ones from the Music Pass and other collab skins previously made available in the market. Those are not included in the free Christmas event.\n\n\nImage via Epic Games\n\n\nSince the event runs until January 7, 2025, he will be made available sometime before this concludes. Just log in every day and open the gifts left for you here.\n\n\nEventually, there will be more gifts. As time progresses, more will show up, but have not been fully added into the game just yet. You don’t even need to actively play to be eligible to open these either.\n\n\nThese are all pre-determined gifts from various NPCs in the game.

          "description": "The Fortnite Winterfest 2024 began as scheduled on December 20, and it brings a whole bunch of rewards for the players, including the Yulejacket skin.\n\n\nThe festive season has finally arrived, and players can finally open the colorful gifts that can be found at the Cabin. It was already confirmed that the gifting season will be back once again, and the Yulejacket skin is certainly the top draw in my books. As things stand, this skin might test your patience if you want to get it on day one of the fest.\n\n\nHow to find the Yulejacket skin in Fortnite\n\n\nThe Yulejacket skin is part of the Winterfest 2024 offerings, so you won't have to spend any resources. It's situated in one of the many colored boxes that can be found at the Cabin. You can access the location from the main menu itself (look for the special icon at the top of your home screen).\n\n\nIt was already rumored there would be 14 different gifts, and that appears to be the case once again. If you believe in rumors, the Yulejacket skin is in the Green box with the Red Bow box (one of the two largest boxes).\n\n\nImage via Destructoid\n\n\nIt appears that if you try to open the box on the very first day, you can't. Once you pick it, you will see that the box is saved for the last day. In all likelihood, this is indeed the box from where you might get the Yulejacket skin.\n\n\nAll the other boxes I picked can be immediately opened, which makes it clearer about where the skin is. In fact, Yulejacket is the only skin that's part of the Fortnite Winterfest 2024 offerings, which makes sense for Epic to lock it behind a type of advent calendar.\n\n\nNevertheless, there are still some really fun rewards you can unlock in the meantime. You can open one box daily, and they will feature random rewards ranging from Pickaxe to Emotes. Make sure to log in to the game every day so that you can unbox a present in the Cabin every day.\n\nThe post How to get the Yulejacket skin in Fortnite appeared first on Destructoid.",

The snowman locations, for example, remain the same, and so does the Gooch. It's Rockstar's take on the nefarious Grinch, and you'll have to perform certain tasks to make it spawn.\n\n\nHow to find the Gooch in GTA 5 Online\n\n\nThe process of spawning the Gooch in GTA 5 Online remains the same. The location and timing of its spawn are random, but there are certain prerequisites you'll have to complete. You'll need to spend at least 48 real-time minutes in a single play session with two or more players.\n\n\nYou'll also need to have enough money and snacks on your in-game character because the Grooch has its eyes on that stuff. If you have them and spend the required time, the creature will spawn randomly and loot your resources. While the timing will be random, there will be a green smoke before your character gets knocked out.\n\n\n\n\nThe objective now will be to get back what's been looted from you. Open your mini-map, and you'll find the Gooch's location marked as a red dot. You'll have to pursue and kill it, but doing so is entirely up to you. You can engage with it directly and use a weapon you have or just run it over with a vehicle.\n\n\nOnce you complete the task, you'll get back all the items that were stolen from you. Additionally, you'll also get the Gooch mask and full outfit. The rare costume will be a great addition to your inventory, but it will also be available for a limited time.\n\nThe post How to spawn the Gooch in GTA 5 Online appeared first on Destructoid.",

With the map and NPC locations changing with Winterfest, he can be tricky to find. Here is how to find Sgt. Winter in the Winterfest event in Fortnite and complete the quest.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nWhere to find Sgt. Winter in Fortnite Winterfest event\n\n\nYou can find Sgt. Winter standing around at the crashed airplane located in the snowy mountains just south of the center of the map. If you look at the map above, we've circled the area in red for you. There is no marked location near Sgt. Winter, but it's south of Foxy Floodgate across the frozen lake, and northwest of Masked Meadows.\n\n\nOnce you land at the crashed plane, you'll immediately see Sgt. Winter standing near the front of the plane. Speak to him to complete your first quest for the Winterfest event!\n\n\nBe aware that a lot of people are dropping here either to do this first quest, or to get some easy kills by taking out those doing the quest. Just make sure you drop close to Sgt. Winters and immediately speak to him to complete the quest before someone wipes you out.\n\n\nAnother option is to land just outside of the area where Sgt. Winter is, wait for a minute or two, then go in and speak to him. The next quest has you speaking to Noir on the top floor of a building in Seaport City, so it too will require dealing with a high-activity drop area.\n\n\nAs with most quests in Fortnite, you can also open your Quests window and click on the Case Assignment for Sgt. Winter to get a marker placed on your map that indicates where Sgt. Winter can be found.\n\nThe post How to find Sgt. Winter in Winterfest Fortnite appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The annual Fortnite Winterfest is here, bringing holiday-themed events, quests, and most importantly, presents. However, some users have reported not being able to see or get any presents from the Fortnite Winterfest event. Here's some solutions on how to fix the no present bug in Fortnite Winterfest and start earning presents for the event.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHow to fix no presents in Fortnite Winterfest\n\n\nFor most players, the no present bug in Fortnite Winterfest is actually just a visual bug that occurs because Fortnite will only show so many quests for each game mode. Therefore, you should switch game modes to get the game to force the Daily Gifts present popup to trigger. This means if you are on build mode, try switching to zero build, and vice versa. This fixes the no present bug issue for most players.\n\n\nHowever, if you're still having the bug, or you were able to get to the present screen in the lodge but it says you have none when you should, there are some more things you can try:\n\n\n\nMake sure the Fortnite servers aren't having problems. If the servers are down or congested from a lot of players jumping in right when they come online, it can lag out the presents. In this case, just try again later.\n\n\nDouble check your own internet connection. If your internet connection is dropping or unstable it can also make the presents not load. If you are on a wireless connection, try switching to a more stable wired one.\n\n\nCheck your Fortnite version. The easiest way to do this fix is to simply restart your game which should trigger the latest update to start downloading. If you're not on the most up-to-date version, new features like the presents will not work.\n\n\n\nKeep in mind you will receive one new preset per day, so if you've already opened todays, you have to wait until reset you obtain your next one.\n\nThe post How to fix the no present bug in Fortnite Winterfest appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A Pokémon game can’t really be a Pokémon game without trading. With the recent success in Pokémon TCG Pocket, it begs the question: when is trading coming? \n\n\nWhat can players expect from this? We’ll have everything we know about the absent feature in the game and when we can expect it to be released.\n\n\nWhen is trading coming to Pokémon TCG Pocket?\n\n\nTrading will be coming to Pokémon TCG Pocket in January 2025. However, there do seem to be some limitations on what can be traded.\n\n\nIn an official post by the admins on the Pokémon TCG Pocket website, “certain cards” are going to be allowed to be traded in this January update. What that entails is yet to be determined.\n\n\nWhat we can gather from this is that there won’t be full trading capabilities in the update. It’ll be a soft launch where only a handful of allowed cards will be tradeable. Whether this is to test the waters or see if there are any loopholes, exploits, or outside transactions, we will not know.\n\n\n\n\nThis function will “gradually expand the selection of cards that are able to be traded” after the initial January 2025 update. \n\n\nAs of right now, if you are looking to get specific cards from people or just rarer stuff like EX and full-art cards, your best bet is to keep buying packs and using the Wonder Pick feature. \n\n\nWhen we get more information on the card limitations, we’ll be sure to let you know. \n\n\nFor now, the Mythical Island booster set is out, with many new cards to get your hands on to shake up the meta. Not only do you have the legendary birds to worry about, but Celebi decks are now the new bane of many players’ existences. \n\n\nTrading cannot come sooner so that we can lessen the RNG from opening dozens of packs.\n\nThe post When is trading coming to Pokémon TCG Pocket? appeared first on Destructoid.",
