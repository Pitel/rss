Wonder in the final week of 2023. According to GfK (thanks, GamesIndustry), the former is also the biggest boxed game of 2023, supplanting EA's footballing juggernaut for the first time in a decade.\nYou might remember that in our last UK Charts breakdown we mentioned Mario Wonder missed out on the Christmas number one. That's still technically true, but according to new GfK data, it was actually the highest-selling game on a single platform; EA Sports FC 24 beat it simply thanks to combined sales across multiple consoles.

Which is true! Often if you see a \"quick crossword\" in a UK paper that means \"crossword with clues that are general knowledge questions and not an archaic set of riddles - you know, for if you're waiting for the kettle to boil, or are an idiot\". So I decided to look into how you actually do cryptics. It's way harder than I thought, but at the same time I did not realise it's just smug puns.\nRead more",

          "description": "Tim Cain wrote what is perhaps gaming’s most famous and influential monologue: the introduction to Fallout. “War never changes,” he says. “People loved it. I’m like, ‘I must be a writer.’” Yet much more recently, when Cain sat down to write his memoirs, nobody really liked what came out on the page. “I was really, really bad at it,” he says. “I had half a dozen people read it, and they all pretty much said that the stories were good, but my writing wasn’t.”\r\n\n\r\nCain’s writing strengths, as fellow Fallout originator Leonard Boyarsky has suggested, lie in shortform. Which was bad news for anyone who wanted to read the definitive account of his four decades at the heart of Interplay, Troika and Obsidian, three of the most important RPG studios of all time. Thankfully, though, it turns out Cain is a natural raconteur. The same anecdotes that appeared flat and toneless in his memoirs go down a storm on YouTube. There, for the past seven months, Cain has been delivering his stories straight to camera, as if at a dinner party with 73,500 other people. “When I started the channel, I would effectively just look at something in the book and be like, ‘I’ll tell that story today,’” he says. “Now I spend as much time answering questions and doing videos based on things people ask about.” \r\n\n \nRead more",

The creature was pretty lively over the Xmas weekend, but Graham managed to soothe it with posts about gaming-related new year resolutions and, of all things, the Spike Video Game Awards. We can expect the Maw's petulance to mount during January, a lean month for announcements and revelations, but there are a few tasty morsels in the offing - a new Prince of Persia and Tekken 8, for instance. Fingers crossed we can build up some kind of momentum.\nSome new game releases we are pointing our telescopes at this week: Skeleton Rebellion (4th Jan), a scrappy offbeat RPG with claymation elements in which you are a skeleton trying to overthrow some mages, and The Night Is Grey (5th Jan), a point-and-click adventure about a beardy bloke and a little girl stuck in the woods with some weirdo wolves. If you like, you can also play a free drinking game I've just invented in which you do a shot for every time I accidentally write 2023 instead of 2024.\n Read more",

It's wrong, I tell you!\nIf all were just and right in the world, then it wouldn't have left out the following list of excellent games that came out this year! Plus a couple others that came out of early access in 2023 but which I sadly don't have time to write about in full. Trust me, The Last Spell and Against The Storm are both phenomenal games as well.\nAnyway: in this handsomely decorated selection box, you'll find four of my honourable mentions for games I've enjoyed playing the most this year. If you have a hole in your Steam library, maybe these will help fill it over the Christmas break!\nRead more",

Usually we stay well out of the spotlight, because people only like seeing guides if they're actively searching for it. But today, we're staging a coup. We're taking centre stage, and threatening the lighting technician with all manner of disagreeable bodily experiences unless they keep the spotlight fixed firmly on us for the duration of this post.\n2023 has been an amazing standout year for guides. Let's take a look at the games that have defined the year for us, and celebrate some of the fantastic work our team has published.\n Read more",

I didn't play quite as many small, odd things as I would have liked in 2023.

Now that it's December and life has settled somewhat, I had to wrack my brain to come up with three entries for this Selection Box.

I've tried to cut it down a bit from last year, for both our sakes, dear reader, and decided that previews don't count (because as a format previews do a lot of the work for you, to be honest). Even reducing my task this way made it tough to whittle things down, and I'm sure I've missed some excellent articles and writers - and that I will be corrected in the comments!\nStill, read on for a place to start if you want to look back at the year that was on RPS. We've got interviews, community nonsense, and even more interviews for you to enjoy here. I think in 2024 I'm going to advocate for more horseposting.\nRead more",

Each year the Sugar Plum Fairy has to collect more wishes to power the spells every year (you can help to make the spells more powerful by joining the RPS supporter program).

While not as infinitely mutable as other 90’s icons like Doom (which just turned 30, and can be played on a pregnancy test), stealth gaming’s grandpappy has maintained an enduring appeal and influence, especially for those more inclined to sneaking than slaughter. Buckets of digital ink have already been spilt examining this legacy, so I won’t dive into the weeds of a hagiography. What I want to highlight is a major event that marked the 25th anniversary – one that makes today as great a time as any to explore Thief’s still-thriving mod scene.\r\n\n\r\nNotable: After a quarter-century, stealth fans were gifted a new, 10-mission Thief campaign called The Black Parade. Pitched as a prequel to the first game, it features a new protagonist, new story, and new heists, built by some of the most lauded modders on the scene. More notable still: The team lead is Romain Barrilliot, a fan-turned-pro designer at Arkane, where he, alongside other former Thief acolytes, iterates the immersive sim tenets in their patented im-sim laboratory. Mostest notablest? One of Thief’s original designers, Daniel Thron, joined The Black Parade’s team – and simultaneously released a new Thief short film, featuring the original game’s voice actors.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The summer, however, was the quietest I've known for a long time, to the point where I ended up playing two VR minigolf games in the absence of anything better to do. Fortunately, the last few months have made up for it, providing enough fantastic VR games to feed us well into next year.

          "description": "Blizzard have revealed their approximate update plans for the next year of arthouse oddity World Of Warcraft, which if I remember correctly is a \"massively multiple-player\" experience of some antiquity that involves Orcs - a kind of always-online Baldur's Gate, if you will, or a strictly fantasy-themed Fortnite with dungeons instead of forts. Seems far-fetched, but let's roll with it. \r\n\n\r\nAs a reminder, WOW now comes in two broad flavours: classic and modern. In modern World Of Warcraft, you can expect three more updates for the existing Dragonflight expansion before the release of World Of Warcraft: The War Within later in the year. This introduces a new subterranean playspace, the Ringing Deeps, and is the first in a trilogy of expansions called The Worldsoul Saga. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Logitech's best value FPS mouse, the G Pro Superlight, is down to $60 when you buy it refurbished in the US at the company's official store. That's a huge reduction from its launch MSRP of $150 and even the $100 that the refurbished models normally go for. \nI love this mouse because it's extremely comfortable, with a smooth and streamlined symmetric shape that sits easily in the hand, with a lightweight 63g design. This makes it extremely agile for fast-paced games, and this is backed up by bulletproof Lightspeed wireless, a top optical sensor and excellent battery life too. That's why I ended up with two of them - one in black and one in pink - and I still use them on the regular for Counter-Strike 2, Valorant and Warzone. \nRead more",

          "description": "Whew! What a year it was. We saw The best Steam games of 2023 revealed – with some surprising results – countered by the tragic loss of a lot of studios and development teams. Above all, the last 12 months have shown the popularity of gaming is by no means dipping.\n\n\nAccording to recent data from SteamDB, 14,533 games were released on the Steam platform in 2023. With the exception of 2018, we can see this number has been on the rise since the early 2000s. According to the graph, October was the busiest month, with 1,324 titles released on the platform.\n\n\n\n\nGiven what we can see – and providing the data is indeed accurate – we can expect this figure to rise even further throughout this new year.\n\n\nDiamonds in the rough\n\n\nObviously, over 14,500 video game launches is a lot. But it's more than likely that many of these would have been obscure indie titles that perhaps didn't make much of an impact. But that's okay, the number alone shows that gaming – especially on PC – continues to be on the rise.\n\n\nActually, the indie scene did have quite an impact on the industry. The SteamDB chart shows that independent developers released a total of 6,408 games, which accounts for around 44% of all titles released last year. That and we got to see the enormous success of the likes of Lethal Company, which still holds a high position on Steam's Top Sellers (just behind Baldur's Gate 3, no less).\n\n\nIn short, 2023 saw a hell of a lot of video games being released on Steam. May it continue into 2024 and beyond.\n\nThe post More than 14,000 games were released on Steam in 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The chance to revisit Vice City in the next installment of Rockstar's Goliath franchise is something many of us are looking forward to. But there is another project that's worth keeping an eye on.\n\n\nAs spotted by DSO Gaming, a studio called Revolution Team is currently remaking the original Vice City, hoping to succeed where the official remaster failed. The trailer below teases what's to be expected in what's being called the Nextgen Edition.\n\n\n\n\nGoing off the description on YouTube, the developer is taking the 2002 Grand Theft Auto game and importing it into Rockstar's RAGE engine. More specifically, it looks as though this remake will use the GTA IV version.\n\n\nNo AI upscaling here, it would seem\n\n\nRevolution Team acknowledges the Definitive Edition, saying that this version of Vice City will be different, i.e. better.\n\n\n\nThe official remaster uses the Unreal Engine only for rendering, but the game’s physics engine is still RenderWare, released more than 20 years ago, with outdated mechanics and animations.\n\n\n\n\nThe project is expected to release sometime in 2025. Here's what else you can expect in the Nextgen Edition:\n\n\n\n• Improved version of the city from Definitive Edition\n• Improved weapons from Definitive Edition\n• All cars from the Xbox version of the game\n• Models of all characters and peds from the Xbox version of the game (with improved textures)\n• All original radio stations\n• Cut scenes from the original game\n• Design in the style of the original game\n• Neon on buildings from Vice City Stories\n• Additional fixes and improvements from the Revolution Team\n\n\n\nThe post In the wake of the GTA 6 reveal, an unofficial remake of Vice City is in the pipeline appeared first on Destructoid.",

Voting ran from 21 December at 10 AM PT until 2 January at 10 AM PT. \n\n\nIf you've been paying attention to gaming last year, then many of the winners won't be a surprise, although there are a few unexpected titles that make the final list. \n\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 snatches up Game of the Year. With a reputation that has placed it among one of the best CRPGs of all time, this isn't unexpected. It faced competition from titles like Resident Evil 4 Remake, Lethal Company, and Hogwarts Legacy.

          "description": "Disney dropped a blog post today teasing what the House of Mouse has in store for fans across the next 12 months. Among the things the company reaffirmed was that Star Wars Outlaws is indeed coming this year.\n\n\nOddly though, when the blog was initially published, it specifically stated \"late 2024\" as the release window for Outlaws. However, a few hours later, the post was updated to remove \"late\" and now simply lists 2024. \n\n\nA lot to explore in 2024. \n\n\nNothing was really shared on the project other than a vague summation.  The blog simply teased that players will \"explore distinct planets across the galaxy, both iconic and new.\" \n\n\nWe were first introduced to the game when Ubisoft unveiled it during Xbox's 2023 Games Showcase. Set in the time period between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, Star Wars Outlaws revolves around the underground world of the franchise. You play as an outlaw scoundrel by the name of Kay Vess as she attempts a massive heist alongside her companion, Nix. \n\n\nDeveloped by Massive Entertainment, the title features a variety of different forms of gameplay. While it's primarily a third-person action-adventure project, you'll also encounter stealth, vehicular combat, space combat, and more.\n\n\nThe \"late 2024\" designation may have been removed from Disney's blog, but it's still probably safe to assume that's the targeted window for Outlaws at this point. For whatever reason, Disney and Ubisoft must just not be ready to formally list the game's release date as such. Regardless, there's little doubt we'll be seeing much more of Star Wars Outlaws in the near future.\n\nThe post Disney will release open world Star Wars Outlaws in 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

And that’s about 90% of what you need to know about this DLC.\n\n\nGranted, I don’t think that’s a bad thing. I generally feel grated by DLC that’s kind of slapped haphazardly onto a game without a lot of thought, and that’s not the case with Echoes of the Fallen. Instead, Echoes of the Fallen functions as a neat bonus endgame quest that culminates in the game's closest equivalent to a superboss. I didn’t necessarily find Final Fantasy XVI lacking for content, but I really like how integrated into the game this DLC is. A totally new player wouldn't even know this was content added after the fact if the game didn't announce it!\n\n\nThat said, is Echo…",

Titled Seeds of Renewal, the update brings a handful of new content to the popular MMORPG as well as concludes the current storyline campaign of the Dragon Isles.\n\n\nImage via Blizzard\n\n\nWorldwide Dragonriding and Azerothian Archives and more\n\n\nOne of the most popular mechanics introduced in World of Warcraft: Dragonflight is Dragonriding. Currently, the feature is only accessible in the new expansion area, the Dragon Isles.  However, with the Seeds of Renewal update, Dragonriding is being expanded to be useable in all old-world continents where flying is available which includes most of Azeroth.\n\n\nA new system is also being added called the Azerothian Archives. Players will have the chance to deliver into the history and lore of the Dragon Isles and explore an iconic time before the expansion over Weekly Public Events at the Traitor's Rest. Solo and Group activities will be available and reward players with Battle Pets, Mounts, and a Transmog set.\n\n\nFans of Worgens and Genn Greymane, the King of Gilneas, will be happy to see the King finally attempt to reclaim the kingdom of Gilneas in the Seeds of Renewal update. Gilneas has long been abandoned after being invaded by the Forsaken and then ripped asunder by the Cataclysm in the World of Warcraft: Cataclysm expansion. Players will have the opportunity to aid King Greymane in retaking Gilneas.\n\n\nFinally, Follower Dungeons are being added in the Seeds of Renewal update as well. Players can enlist the help of NPC companions to clear through dungeons instead of doing so with other players. All eight Normal Dragonflight Dungeons will now automatically scale and fill between 1-4 AI players, with more dungeons to come in the future.\n\n\nThe World of Warcraft 10.2.5 Seeds of Renewal update is set to launch on January 16.\n\n\n\nThe post World of Warcraft 10.2.5 Seeds of Renewal is set to release January 16 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Psycho Patrol R is now available for wishlisting, though there is no announced release window.\n\n\nI had noticed Consumer Softproducts tinkering around with a mech game since the release of Cruelty Squad, but with such things, sometimes an end result is never seen. However, it’s looking more likely with the official name and fancy store page.\n\n\nPsycho Patrol R has you play as a federal police officer of the eponymous Psycho Patrol. You’re tasked with piloting a V-Stalker to solve “mental crime, among other things.” It bills itself as a “combination of high-intensity tactical FPS combat” and takes place in an open, non-linear world. You’re also able to customize the equipment on your stompy V-Stalker, which I think is an unwritten law in the world of mech games. It also appears that you will be spending some time outside of your robot womb and can engage in thrilling conversations about cryptocurrency with executives.\n\n\nRight now, it looks like Psycho Patrol R will tone down the garish and nauseatingly surreal colors of Cruelty Squad, but the game’s graphics still scream jank-pop. I think I might have been disappointed if it didn’t.\n\n\nI reviewed Cruelty Squad back in 2021. I called out its deliberately stilted gameplay, referring to it as “a purposeful desecration of the holy grounds of game design.” That was one of the first times I was quoted on Wikipedia, but the phrase was eventually expunged from the article to make room for more favorable acclamations. I meant it as a compliment. Cruelty Squad has been living in my brain ever since and is probably the source of trauma that has driven me into the arms of similar jank-pop titles.\n\n\nPsycho Patrol R is currently set for release on PC, though no release window has been stated.\n\nThe post Steam listing up for Psycho Patrol R, next game from Cruelty Squad dev appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "In a New Year’s letter, Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu plans to be “aggressive in applying” generative AI to their “content development and publishing functions” going forward.\n\n\nKiryu doesn’t really get specific about their intended uses for AI beyond that, merely spending a couple of paragraphs extolling the potential of the relatively new technology. He says, “I believe that generative AI has the potential not only to reshape what we create, but also to fundamentally change the processes by which we create, including programming.”\n\n\nIf you’re not familiar with Square Enix’s New Year’s messages, they have previously been undersigned by former president Yosuke Matsuda. They have, for the past couple of years, delved into the company’s intentions with Web 3.0, NFTs, blockchain, and the Metaverse. Square Enix even went as far as selling off Crystal Dynamics, Eidos-Montreal, and Square Enix Montreal to Embracer Group to help fund their investment in those technologies.\n\n\nConsidering this letter is meant to ring in the New Year after one that was rife with job losses and layoffs, it’s pretty bold to talk about AI. While the letter says nothing about an intention to replace employee processes with the technology, when the topic of the benefits of generative AI comes up, it usually involves the automation of roles. It’s tone-deaf to bring it up as a positive direction when the roles of artists and software engineers are often considered vulnerable to replacement by the technology.\n\n\nSo, in the spirit of that callousness, I feel it’s appropriate to bring up that a not-insignificant portion of executives have stated that their own jobs could be replaced by AI.\n\n\nOn the other hand, it can be perceived as amusing to hear Square Enix say this sort of thing – even bringing up text-based dialogue – when their previous experiments with such a thing went hilariously awry.\n\nThe post Square Enix plans to expand use of generative AI in 2024, according to company president appeared first on Destructoid.",

Death Stranding 2 still \"has some ADR left\" and after that, the studio will focus on doing Japanese voice-overs. There's still no official release date for Death Stranding 2, but with Kojima discussing \"another year of development,\" a 2025 launch wouldn't be out of the question. \n\n\nImage via Kojima Productions.\n\n\nA busy year for Kojima Productions\n\n\nDuring The Game Awards 2023, Kojima spoke a bit about OD which is described as a title that will defy expectations and expand the medium. He's enlisted the help of movie-maker Jordan Peele, and we've received a cryptic teaser trailer, though we're still stuck without a release date.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough Kojima intends to limit his business trips this year, he's still busy turning Death Stranding into a movie, collaborating on the Avengers, and working on OD in addition to other video projects. He also mentions a writing project along with the possible revival of Hide Radio and \"a special program on 'HideTube'.\"\n\n\n\n\nIt appears it's a busy year ahead for Kojima Productions, but we may see the fruits of the studio's labor soon. Plenty of the upcoming projects intrigue me, but I'm particularly interested to see how Death Stranding's movie adaptation will be handled.

If I knew what I was thinking about, I’d be even more excited.\n\n\nHammerin’ Harry is a port of Irem’s 1990 arcade game, which was called Daiku no Gen-san: Beranme-chō Sōdōki in Japan. While Irem is perhaps best remembered for their R-Type series, their back catalog is built from an extremely colorful mix of titles on both arcade and consoles.

It has a simple premise - go on a date with Ariane and ensure it ends on a sexual note.

Sony has confirmed it'll be there, and you'll be able to watch its presentation streamed on its official YouTube channel at 05:00 PM PST. \n\n\nDescribed as one of the world's largest technology events, you'll want to keep an eye on CES to see what game-changing tech is coming our way. This could range from televisions to cameras and other electronics produced by the tech world. \n\n\nThis year, Sony aims to focus on the company's purpose which is to \"fill the world with emotion, through the power of creativity and technology.\" The company has yet to reveal what's in store, though it has revealed that it will be joined by Sony Honda Mobility. \n\n\nIn its announcement of its attendance, the company looks back at its past attendance at the event. It appeared at CES for the first time in June 1977, and since then it has showcased plenty of new technology during its presentations, including the \"world's first CD player.\" Since then, the company gradually shifted its approach to the event, and it is now concerned with \"introducing its latest technologies and initiatives that support creators.\"\n\n\nYou should be warned that this event is not centered on PlayStation, and it is only one of Sony's several ventures. Nevertheless, past CES events have brought us some interesting gaming news. In 2023, we got a look at Sony's accessibility controller which launched on December 6, while in 2022 we got a glimpse of the PS VR2 which hit shelves in February this year.  \n\n\nCES 2024 is set to be another packed event filled with exhibitors hoping to show off their latest advancements. According to the event organizer, there will be over 150 companies represented. Companies that have confirmed their attendance include Samsung, Lenovo, and Intel to name a few.\n\nThe post Sony confirms CES 2024 attendance appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It's been a long time coming, but the ambitious Fallout London mod is on the horizon. The bad news is that the team has been unable to meet its intended 2023 deadline. The good news, however, is that the fan-made Fallout 4 project is just a few months away from release.\n\n\nIn the latest dev video diary, narrator and voice actor Drew Faithwaite has given the skinny on where things are at with Fallout London. As of now, the project is pretty much complete, save for some testing. After all the hard work and dedication, Faithwaite is proud to announce that the mod is finally coming out on April 23, 2024.\n\n\n\n\nOur British readers should be familiar with that date, as it's when St. George's Day takes place. Talk about patriotic! There's not long to wait now, and this extra time gives the volunteers one last push to get London ready.\n\n\nOne of the most ambitious mods out there\n\n\nIf you're a fan of Fallout but aren't sure what this project is, boy are you in for a treat! It's essentially a community-made DLC-sized modification for Fallout 4 that – as the name heavily implies – sets things in England's capital city, complete with its own story and factions.\n\n\nIt boasts 90,000 lines of dialogue (more than New Vegas, apparently), new animations, plenty of quests, as well as 15 districts to explore, including Croydon, Hackney, Camden, Westminster, and of course, the City of London itself.\n\n\nThe team sadly had to push the initial release window back due to global issues involving some of the developers. However, things appear to be on-track again and the delay doesn't seem to have hampered the mod too much.\n\n\nCheck out the official Fallout London website for more details about the project. I, for one, am very excited about it. Is that because I'm British myself? That could be part of it, I admit.\n\nThe post Long-awaited Fallout 4 mod, Fallout London, announces release date appeared first on Destructoid.",

The studio announced this achievement on X today, alongside some new art from the game to celebrate the milestone. Selling 3 million units is no small feat, especially considering Dave the Diver is Mintrocket's first game. \nIn Dave the Diver, players control Dave as he dives during the day to find treasure, fish, complete quests, and more. At night, Dave runs a sushi restaurant, and the game mixes its adventure gameplay with its simulation gameplay really well – read more about that in Game Informer's Dave the Diver review. \n🌊3 million global sales of Dave the Diver!🤿\npic.twitter.com/YzfUSOrHxd\nJanuary 3, 2024\nDave the Diver received great word-of-mouth at the time of its PC release in June, bolstered further by a Switch release later in October.

          "description": "Update: Earlier today, a Disney Parks blog pointed to Star Wars Outlaws releasing in late 2024, but the term \"late\" has now been removed from the post so that is now reads just 2024. Ubisoft also confirmed to Kotaku that, \"the timing was incorrect and has since been amended.\" So, Star Wars Outlaws' release window has moved from late 2024 back to some general time this year.\nOriginal story:\nStar Wars Outlaws, Ubisoft's upcoming open-world Star Wars game, has enjoyed a vague 2024 release window since it was revealed at an Xbox Showcase last year. However, a recent post on Disney's official park blog has given the game a more specific window. According to the blog, Star Wars Outlaws is releasing late 2024. The blog post, which is a collection of 24 exciting Disney-things happening in 2024 reads, \"And for Star Wars fans – Star Wars Outlaws, the open-world Star Wars game is set to release late this year.\"\nStar Wars Outlaws follows an original Star Wars character named Kay Vess and seeks to explore a character archetype of the Star Wars universe we haven't spent much time with in video games: the Han Solo-inspired scoundrel. In the game, Vess (who has no Jedi abilities as far as we know) must survive by her wits and her ability to talk (or blast) her way through difficult situations.\nFor more on Star Wars Outlaws, you can read our interview with the game's narrative director, Navid Khavari, where we covered topics like whether or not the game will have an overlap with Shadows of the Empire and if the team has been communicating with Respawn regarding its Jedi series of games. The game is planned for release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

Its first two titles, Detention and Devotion, impressed and terrified fans with frighteningly strong horror chops, but the team is leaving that behind to tackle something completely different in Nine Sols. This side-scrolling action platformer blends sci-fi with Chinese mythology and is Red Candle’s most ambitious project yet. This significant step forward affords an opportunity to look back on the studio’s young history, so we spoke with co-founder Vincent Yang to learn about how a small band of gamers in Taiwan formed one of the industry’s most promising – and, at one time, controversial – indie studios.\nRed Candle Games began in 2014 when designer Coffee Yao was developing a prototype for Detention.

The 2008 Prince of Persia reboot didn’t reignite the series as Ubisoft had hoped, and 2010’s Forgotten Sands felt closer to a movie tie-in than a new, proper entry.\nThat game’s subtitle would end up being a portend of the future as the series seemed inexplicably lost to time.

Unsurprisingly, then, video games also tell stories of migration.

Store shelves were crowded with poorly made games, and consumer interest waned substantially. Developers that ushered in the “golden age” of arcades and the first two generations of home consoles began to crash and burn at an alarming pace. In no time, the once billion-dollar industry was reduced to rubble.\nIn the summer of that same year, in Japan, gaming giant Nintendo released its first-ever home console with swappable cartridges.

It was a fantastic year for gamers at home with great tentpole releases from PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo, and some excellent indies, too. For years to come, we will all likely argue that 2023 was one of the best – if not the best – year for games. But it was also a terrible year for the people who make games, with more than 10,000 developers laid off, studios closed, and more. \nBetween big video game releases, a heartbreaking amount of layoffs, record-breaking acquisitions and box office reports, and more, 2023 contained plenty of news stories that had us talking for weeks, speculating on the future of the industry, and reshaping how we view game development.

While he thought it dragged on a bit in the second half, our reviewer said, \"Calling Requiem a standard sequel is a disservice; Asobo has created a Plague Tale epic.\" You can read that full review here and take a look at the other two offerings below.\nThe other two games are Evil West and Nobody Saves the World, each also released in 2022. Evil West is a third-person shooter set in a world that's a fusion between a classic Wild West and gothic horror and one that reminded one of our editors of his time as a kid playing Darkwatch. Meanwhile, Nobody Saves the World is about a shapeshifting Nobody (yeah, that's his name) on a quest to find the wizard who can stop a fungal infection from overtaking the world. Written by John Carson, the Game Informer review reads, \"Despite its minor shortcomings, Nobody Saves the World kept me enthralled from start to finish.\"D All three games will be available to download on January 2.\nAnd as always, as the new comes in, the old must go; subscribers will have until January 1 to download the current crop of PS Plus games, which includes Lego 2K Drive, Powerwash Simulator, and Sable.\nAre you excited to check out any of January's PS Plus Games?

During his tenure, he worked on first-party behemoths like God of War, Horizon: Zero Dawn, and Detroit: Become Human. But today, heʼs talking about a different type of testing involving a headset and physically mimicking movements for multiple hours at your office desk.\nIn games like Blood & Truth, where you take a starring role in action movie-esque setpieces, the fun factor of virtual reality quickly makes itself apparent.

The tuned-to-perfection turn-based combat, the beautiful soundtrack, the heartfelt story, and the eye-popping-for-the-time visuals created one of the most important entries of one of the most important franchises in video game history. However, one element was absent from Final Fantasy X that several of the key developers involved with the project lamented: an explorable world map.\nFor Yoshinori Kitase, a producer on Final Fantasy VII Rebirth who also served as a director on Final Fantasy VI, VII, VIII, and X, the world map's disappearance was a sore spot as someone who has been involved with the series since 1990. \"We started off expressi…",

          "description": "South Park: Snow Day, the upcoming four-player cooperative adventure first announced in August, is coming on March 26. A new trailer shows off more of the game’s frosty action and, of course, the series’ signature foul-mouth humor.\nAs the New Kid, players join Cartman, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny on an epic quest after a blizzard blankets the Colorado town, and school is canceled. Like the most recent South Park titles, The Stick of Truth and The Fractured But Whole, the adventure is told through the lens of a make-believe high-fantasy adventure, but Snow Day ditches turn-based combat in favor of a more action-oriented experience. \n\n\nPlayers can use different melee and ranged weapons, wield magic and other abilities, and customize their character with various clothing. Snow Day can be played with up to four friends, alongside strangers in online matchmaking, or as a solo experience with A.I. allies. \nSouth Park: Snow Day is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.",

          "description": "Fntastic announced earlier this month that it would be closing down, just days after launching its controversial game, The Day Before. It said at the time that servers for The Day Before would remain in operation but that the game's future was unknown. Now, the studio has announced that it has officially ceased operations and The Day Before's servers will be turned off next month. \nMore specifically, the servers will be turned off on January 22, 2024. While the game has an emphasis on online play, it could still be played offline. However, on December 12, five days after the game launched on Steam, it was pulled from the storefront and The Day Before hasn't been available for purchase since. Plus, Fntastic says the game will be \"retired.\" \npic.twitter.com/GIX4ZAztny\nDecember 22, 2023\nHere's Fntastic's full statement on the server closure: \nThe Day Before launched into Early Access on December 7. The game peaked at 38,104 concurrent users at launch on Steam but today, that number is down to 55 players, according to SteamDB. In those four days, The Day Before also received enough negative reviews from players to place it into the 10 worst-reviewed games on Steam. \nOver the years, The Day Before has been the subject of controversy, ranging from requests for volunteer work, various delays, broken promises, and more. Fntastic has scrubbed its entire YouTube channel, leaving the following note as its channel's description: \"We're grateful to everyone who supported us during these difficult years. It's been a fantastic journey over the past eight years.\" \n[Editor's Note: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Fntastic's statement said, \"Steam will not proactively refund all remaining players.\" The statement says, \"Steam will now proactively refund all remaining players\" and the story has been updated to reflect that. Game Informer regrets this mistake.]\nHave you played The Day Before?

After almost eight years as a studio, it will shut down at the end of the year. It cites a lack of VR support within the industry. \n\n\n\"After almost eight years of working with the most amazing team I've ever had the pleasure of being part of, I'm sad to announce that we will be closing our company First Contact Entertainment by the end of the year,\" a Facebook post from the company reads. \"The lack of support for VR within the industry has eventually taken its toll.

By using our affiliate links to buy your favorite games, you granted us a small commission from GOG.com – without having to spend more than the original price.\nEarlier this year, GOG.com announced the discontinuation of its old affiliate program. Instead of using a simple referral link, they are now using two external affiliation networks that contain cross-site tracking, as considered by many ad blockers. Since we have been affiliated with GOG.com since 2009, we were able to use the legacy referral links for a couple of months after they initially discontinued them.\nUnfortunately, our affiliate links were put to rest effective November 22nd, 2023.\nSince we don't feel comfortable that you would have to use external affiliation networks just to support the project, and because tracking users is against our project policies, we decided not to join the new program.\nWe still value GOG.com as an excellent source for legally purchasing games supported by ScummVM. Even though we are not affiliated with them anymore, we'll continue to support their releases, e.g. by adding and updating the game data files' signatures for the ScummVM supported games that are available for purchase from GOG.com in our detection database and providing links to their releases in our list of available games.\nThank you GOG.com and everybody who used our affiliate link for your support over the last 14 years!\n>",
