Much like the previous expansion, this latest release lacks some of the cohesion of the main game, but is nevertheless another fascinating peek into the history of one of gaming’s most iconic brands.\nWith another 19 playable games included, The First Console War delves into Mattel’s introduction to the world of console gaming. Specifically, we are shown how the company approached the creation and marketing of the Intellivision (a brand recently acquired by modern Atari) along with the forming of M Network, a brand that would release modified versions of Intellivision games on the Atari VCS.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Tactically at odds with itself.\nMetal Slug Tactics has felt like it has taken way too long to finally release. More than three years after its initial reveal, the game is finally here and it’s a bold but confused take on the tactics genre that has some big strengths. But, those are counterbalanced with a number of roadblocks and obstacles that often get in the way of the enjoyment you can have with it.\nTo start things off, this reviewer is coming at this as a turn-based tactics fan with no personal history with the Metal Slug series. When it comes to offering something for genre fans, Metal Slug Tactics succeeds, mostly. The game is actually structured as a roguelike, so you and up to two other characters you select from the Peregrine Falcons will head out and take on various, small missions in isometric grids one by one until you gain full control of an area of the map.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Ever since its release on PC in 1996, it has jostled for the top spot on best-ever lists around the internet. It’s landed on consoles and early mobile platforms, including a Director’s Cut that reached Wii and DS. Now, nearly three decades down the line, it’s been 'Reforged'. But does the old game underneath it all still hold up, or is this a cheap nostalgia trip?\nTo set the scene for anyone new to Broken Sword – or to jog the fading memories of those who played it back in the '90s – the story is about George Stobbart, an American tourist in Paris. Relaxing outside a cafe and flirting with the waitress, his sunny morning is soon blown to pieces by a clown with an explosive accordion. George can’t resist poking his nose in – especially after meeting the cynical but charming Nico, a French investigative journalist following the case. The game then rattles through an extensive cast of characters across Europe and the Middle East, unfolding a mystery entangled with the history of the medieval order of the Knights Templar.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Could tower defence be the ultimate \"it's Friday and I am here in body only\" genre? I haven't really thought about it before, but Rift Riff's effusively laidback crowd control has me pondering those optimal moments in any tower defender when the incoming horde hits the flamer-MG triangle just right, and you can settle back comfortably into the role of clockwatcher.\nRift Riff encourages this behaviour by being nice to look at. Created by a trio of developers including Hidden Folks designer Adriaan de Jongh, it's a world of spacey, sun-carved mountains, forests and monoliths. The towers resemble the sacred architecture of Monument Valley, and the colour scheme and general ambience remind me of Cocoon. There's a demo, if you fancy it.\n Read more",

          "description": "Nostalgia, when you think about it, is bollocks. There has never been a better time than right this second – averaged out, and despite repeated attempts to the contrary, humanity has never been healthier, freer, or more enlightened by knowledge. It’s true of games too. For every by-committee platter of passionless map markers, there are thousands of more personal, more creative, more interesting works, all adding to the decades' worth of great stuff we can still play today.\nWhat isn’t bollocks is the emotional pull that nostalgia, for all its lack of cold, hard reason, still manages to wield inside our warm, squishy brains. Hence, the centrepiece of Apex Legends’ Season 23 update is a mode that recreates the battle royale FPS as it was back in 2019, defaulting back to the original map and weapon arsenal while cutting the 26-strong legend roster to the earliest ten. It’s a Fortnite-style rolling back of the clock, and a passably enjoyable one, but also a reminder that the good old days weren’t always that good.\nRead more",

That’s Jules Marmont, the obsessive head of the titular FBC centre.

It's a massively multiplayer World War 2 game, viewed from above, where battlefield logistics matters as much as aiming and flanking. Its developers have just announced a major new update coming next summer, Foxhole: Airborne, which adds planes to the game for the first time.\r\n\nPlanes, in a topdown MMO? It makes a little more sense if you watch the trailer.\r\n\n \nRead more",

What’s interesting about this one is that vlog mainstay director Rich Alridge has brought along some new faces: battle designer Josh King and audio director Chris Goldsmith. And, yes, so no-one can accuse me of burying the lede: that audio design involved the enthusiastic, deeply disgusting slurping of porridge and yoghurt, and the jangling of real bones.

Nic clued me in on this reddit thread earlier, which cites unnamed Chinese players who've allegedly data-mined the beta's monster models, and learned that they are extremely large, encompassing hundreds of thousands of polygons.\nIf every monster in Monster Hunter Wilds were that fancy all of the time, your computer would become a volcano. As such, the game resorts to loading-on-demand systems to ensure that you only see those gorgeous details when the monsters are close by and, as the case may be, angrily sitting on you. When they're further afield, the flourishes fall away to free up memory and processing power. The popular Redditor explanation for the presence of monsters that look like Henry Moore sculpture is basically that the LOD systems are being forgetful, and neglecting to load the additional polygons at proximity.\n  \nRead more",

Still, there is an anecdotal contingent of casual sofa sitters for whom Call Of Duty is the game. A balls-to-the-wall shooter to return to every winter and rinse through in a weekend. Ed has already gestured at its multiplayer, announcing: \"yup, it's COD\", like a deeply tired Captain Birdseye inspecting the day's catch, wondering when his life will change. But never mind that.

Not a bad one. If you like Call Of Duty, you will like this. If you don't like Call Of Duty, you will not like this.\" I feel like we need to emergency-deploy a supply crate of smelling salts, because the sheer OK-ness of Black Ops 6 appears to have tumbled Ed into a stupor. \r\n\n\r\nPerhaps it would be a different story if he'd encountered some of the spawning issues and glitches people are talking about, with players joining games and materialising right into a hail of fire. The players in question include Black Ops 6's developers, who comically note in the latest Black Ops 6 patch notes that \"Yes, we saw ourselves in a Killcam before selecting a Loadout too.\" The latest patch seeks to address this, naturally. As regards the campaign side of things, it also resets your safehouse currency to 5000, if you've had your single player funds stolen (or multiplied) by technical gremlins.\r\n \nRead more",

What little roleplaying it does offer revolves around what flavour of supportive hero you prefer, and you can count the number of impactful dialogue decisions on a three-fingered hand. This might sound utterly damning in the wake of Baldur's Gate 3’s incredible reactivity, and if I approached games as some sort of tedious comparative intellectual exercise rather than just, y’know, seeing how I felt about them, then I suppose it would be. Weirdly, though, the recent memory of Baldur’s Gate 3 didn’t diminish my time with Veilguard at all. It was actually the opposite: it freed Dragon Age from having to carry the torch for a certain period in Bioware’s history, and let me enjoy Veilguard for what it was.\nRead more",

As with the streaming giant's existing labels for M-rated material, sexual themes or depictions of gambling, the idea is that viewers can filter out such streams in advance by altering their settings.\nAdvertisers, similarly, can \"make better choices about the content they want to advertise next to\" - in other words, pull their ads from a whole swathe of material if they don't want to be associated with anything controversial. Twitch's hope is that \"the labels will allow advertisers to have more context to inform which types of streams they show their ads alongside, which we expect to increase brands’ confidence in running ads on Twitch, and could bring new advertisers to our service.\"\n  \nRead more",

Its freely extendable invite system is about as effective at controlling player headcount as a disinterested football steward, meaning pretty much anyone with a clued-in Steam friend can get in and start poking around its secrets. And yet, being a lane-pushing wizard fighter in the Dota 2 vein, it’s already a vast tangle of interplaying abilities, items, strats, and often unspoken rules, of the kind that even experienced gankists will take hundreds of hours to learn. It’s been too much for poor Brendy, at any rate.\nStill, Brendy is but one man. What if we had but four men, working in tandem to crush lanes and flatten Patrons just as Gabe intended? To find out if Deadlock is indeed more comprehensible as a team sport, Graham, Ed, Ollie, and James joined forces, promptly getting fucked up yet emerging from the warlock hospital with a deeper understanding of its workings. Or, at least, if anyone would keep playing.\nRead more",

It's a holographic Animus simulation, conjured from ancestral memories flash-frozen within your DNA - convenient, inasmuch as it means that any inconsistencies are your DNA's fault, not Ubisoft's. If the ledge-mantling animations are glitchy, that's simply because you have bad genes.\nWe can both be forgiven for losing sight of Assassin's Creed's modern day narrative frame. Ubisoft themselves have downplayed it since the era of Desmond Miles, the watery Peter Parker figure who served as puppetmaster protagonist for AC games up to Assassin's Creed 3.

These differences are the basis for many factional disagreements and thus, many core series plot developments.

Personally, it's not the vibe I'm after when I sit down in the evening and I think, \"I would like to play a video game that makes me feel somewhat pleasant\". But hey, it might be for you.\nRead more",

It consists of messages from an oily elder demon to his nephew about how to correctly groom the soul of an unsuspecting human being. It's a claustrophobic send-up of managerial politics and nepotism, with World War 1 unfolding in the background. A real pick-me-up. Sintopia is the Two Point incarnation of that premise - in other words, brighter and breezier and definitely more slapstick than Christian. It puts you in charge of a world divided between Earth and hell, and challenges you to ensure a steady movement of optimally sinful souls between one and the other.

Let's play Devil's Advocate and try to Lionel Hutz that quote: \"Nazis? I hate these guys!\" [pointing at some Communists]. Yeah, I'm not really feeling it.\nI guess Indiana did sleep with a Nazi once, but only by accident, and yes he did once cosplay as an SS officer and get Hitler's autograph, but again, only by accident. Aww, he's such a ditz! I think his political stance is abundantly obvious in Indiana Jones And The Great Circle - the new Wolfenslike from MachineGames, in which you will blast and bludgeon literally hundreds of Shitlerites in unambiguously one-sided first-person view. So it's amusing, if not wholly unexpected, that MachineGames and Bethesda have slapped the game with an explicit disclaimer stating that the game's depictions of Nazis are not, in fact, Nazi propaganda.\n Read more",

It's also a wonderful show of experimentation, switching genres from story to story - one minute you're a playable bestiary on shuffle, the next you're beheading fish in a cannery as the worktable disappears beneath your scrolling daydreams. The developer's next project seems to be pursuing a similar balance of whimsy and darkness. It's another anthology experience, which casts you as a field biologist studying \"the strangeness of organic life\". Also, chicken-legged houses.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I've been deeply moved by individual scenes in this sequel. By the end I was sorry to leave its characters behind. At the same time (please now imagine my face is splitting into a second, colour-washed expression with wobbly VFX) I am relieved it's over, so I don't have to deal with the inconsistent behaviour of those characters, the flimsy plot, and a convoluted approach to murder mystery. \nRead more",

          "description": "In case you don't know the headline reference, Orpheus was a mythical Greek musician who famously descended to the underworld to rescue his snake-bitten lover, Eurydice. The underworld's rulers, Hades and Persephone, were massively bummed out by Orpheus's emo lyre-playing, and swiftly agreed to let him lead Eurydice's soul upward to the waking world, with the extremely simple proviso that he not look back at her till they're both on the surface.\nBeing a love-drunk spannerhead, however, Orpheus couldn't resist a quick peek at Eurydice after crossing the threshold - and the result is a timeless moral about human frailty and the specific truism that you should absolutely never date musicians, which Australian developers Oppolyon Studios appear to have totally ignored in their otherwise-redolent game about kicking your brother's soul out of hell.\n Read more",

You won't have much time to write in Static Dread, sadly. The world has ended, the oceans teem with squirmy, extra-dimensional lifeforms, and it's your job as the apparent sole surviving lighthouse keeper to distinguish vessels loaded with eldritch horrors from vessels loaded with people who need saving from eldritch horrors. \nGoing by the teaser trailer, below, this appears to be comparable to playing border guard in Papers, Please, but it's less political and more tentacular. You field queries over the radio, run your finger down a clipboard, and decide whether to kindle the lamps or beg the coastguard to blast that ship back to hell. There's a dialogue line in the trailer which I, personally, would consider highly untrustworthy. \"It's consuming my team!\" screams a self-described ship captain. \"Please, send help! Gosh...\" Look, \"friend\", no genuine human being says \"gosh\" in an emergency situation. Not even British human beings say \"gosh\" in an emergency situation.

He has been in scintillating form for his club, which has resulted in him winning the best footballer for the previous month. Let's take a look at how you can complete the challenge to add the item to your squad.\n\n\nEA FC 25 Chris Wood Premier League POTM SBC solutions\n\n\nThe Chris Wood Premier League POTM SBC has four different tasks, and here are the conditions. \n\n\nTask1 - 80-Rate Squad\n\n\n\nMin.

That said, the requirement of a single TOTW item feels stiff for my liking, but this Wood card is pretty interesting. While it's not exactly meta, the card offers Target Forward++, and the Power Header+ playstyle. The inclusion of Press Proven, First Touch, and Finesse Shot are all great additions on a target man. \n\n\nThat said, better Pace (83) and a higher overall rating would have made the card much more popular in the community. \n\nThe post EA FC 25: How to complete Chris Wood Premier League POTM SBC appeared first on Destructoid.",

The amphibian in question is the star of Seafrog, which developer Oh My Me Games has officially locked in for an early 2025 launch.\n\n\nThe mechanics immediately piqued my interest. In Seafrog, platforming is accomplished atop the aforementioned rocket-powered wrench. The game's plucky hero can grind on objects, pull off combos with pun-heavy names, and swing onto bolts for a quick mid-air repair. \n\n\nYou can see a sample of how it all works in the trailer below.\n\n\n\n\nAs you progress through the world, you can unlock up to 24 mod chips to equip your wrench with stat boosts. There are also three Master Gears to find along with a bunch of collectible items, including 100 Snakestones, with one hidden in every room. \n\n\nIt all looks very colorful, and while it's on a 2D plane for the most part, the environments and characters have a comfortably rudimentary polygonal texture to them. The bosses on display so far are appropriately screen-filling, too. \n\n\nThe ultimate goal of Seafrog involves repairing derelict ships and gathering enough fuel to get your little froggy butt back to safety.

Each year, N7 Day celebrates the legendary BioWare franchise, and 2024 is no different.\n\n\nThis isn't the first time we've seen the Normandy in No Man's Sky. It was first released back in 2021, marking the launch of Mass Effect: Legendary Edition. This crossover makes tons of sense, so it's great to see it return.\n\n\nImage via Hello Games\n\n\nMass Effect's Normandy is Returning to No Man's Sky\n\n\nWith a trailer and a set of release notes, Hello Games confirmed that Mass Effect's Normandy SR-1 is finally back in the game to mark N7 Day. The Normandy will only be available in No Man's Sky for the next two weeks, making it yet another limited-time event for Mass Effect's iconic frigate.\n\n\n\n\nDescribed as \"a love-letter from one science fiction game to another,\" this No Man's Sky update comes with a revamped version of the mission released back in 2021. When completed, you'll add the Normandy to your fleet, which you can then send out on expeditions to complete. You still can't pilot it, though. Disappointing, I know.\n\n\nFor the rest of N7 Day, players shouldn't expect anything too exciting from BioWare. The recent release of Dragon Age: The Veilguard has already seen the studio confirm it doesn't have any huge plans for a Mass Effect announcement, so as not to distract from its most recent release. \n\n\nThe wait goes on for any news about the upcoming Mass Effect title. In years gone by, N7 Day has seen multiple teasers for the next game in the series, yet it still feels as though we know very little about the game at the moment. \n\nThe post No Man’s Sky brings back Mass Effect’s Normandy for a limited time to celebrate N7 Day appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "After seven months of intense work, we are ready to announce support for a few games based on qdEngine, developed by K-D Labs.\nThe work is based on the original sources published now under GPL, although the work started a bit earlier than that. The engine supports 14 games, five of which we are announcing support for. Most of these games were released in Russian; however, there were Lithuanian, Czech, and Polish releases. The support is announced for:\nWait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare, (Russian: Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца, Lithuanian: Na, palauk! Zuikio dainos, Czech: Jen počkej a Píseň pro zajíce)\nMask Show (Russian: Маски-шоу)\nMarvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы, Czech: Příběhy myší rodinky I, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Na Spotkanie Cioci Myszy)\nThe Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik (Russian: Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)\nMarvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat's Birthday, (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Urodzinowe Śledztwo)\nOther games do work; however, we haven’t playtested them. You may find more information on our Wiki. Also, we are looking for the Lithuanian version of Little Longnose and Polish releases of Little Mice games and Wait for it! game. If you happen to have a copy, please contact sev.\nWe continue the active development so that support for other games will follow shortly. The primary constraint is playtesting.\nTo run these games, you need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any hiccups during your quests, please file them on our issue tracker.\n>",

          "description": "We are excited to announce that Rise of the Dragon  is now ready for public testing. This is the first of a small number of games built using the DGDS (Dynamix Game Development System) engine.\nThe Dynamix name may be familiar – bought by Sierra in 1990, the Dynamix brand continued and became well known for action and puzzle games like The Incredible Machine, A10 Tank Killer, and Red Baron.  They also made a few adventures using the custom DGDS engine.\nRise of the Dragon is set in Los Angeles in a dark version of the future, circa 2053.  You play as Blade Hunter, a private investigator and retired police officer.  After a designer drug kills the mayor's rebellious daughter, Chandra, Hunter is hired to find the people responsible for releasing the drug on the streets. What Blade ultimately finds is much more than he expected.  Rise of the Dragon combines classic point-and-click adventure style with platforming arcade sequences, giving a unique gameplay combination.\nYou’ll need the latest daily build of ScummVM and files from the DOS version of the game, which you can buy at GOG (check our wiki for the required data files).  Please file any issues you notice on our bug tracker.\n>",

          "description": "Není to kvalitní film, ale je šílený a není nudný ani rutinní. Je to výpověď o tom, co si Coppola na stará kolena myslí o světě a o filmařině - a taková výpověď mě zajímá. Ale kdyby to přesně stejně natočil 25letý absolvent filmové akademie, měl bych z toho jen legraci a vysmíval bych se jeho neschopnosti. (Ilča 60%)",

          "description": "Kdybych teoreticky měl pěti- až osmileté dítě, hrozně bych chtěl, aby se mu tenhle film líbil. Kdyby mu bylo 10 nebo 12 let, už bych mu nepouštěl tohle, ale první Bayovy Transformers. Je to fajn, ale je to opravdu jen a pouze pro děti. A navíc, viděl jsem dabovanou verzi a rozhodně byla méně zábavná než tři minuty ukázek v původním znění, které jsem viděl taky. (Ilča 60 %)",
