The Japanese company Atlus is one that's done this time and time again with games like 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim and Persona 5 Royal, and now it's released its guidelines for Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden. This information comes from the company's Japanese website, so the rules may be slightly different here in the west.\nDespite being enhanced re-releases from 2009 and 2012, it's still asking streamers to be courteous of viewers by placing spoiler warnings in their stream. One example (as highlighted by Siliconera) is to insert a spoiler alert when streaming Persona 4 Golden's culprit's dungeon.

Melee, the series has filled a cutthroat, tactical RPG void on almost every Nintendo console since – all the way up to the stellar Fire Emblem: Three Houses on the Switch.\nKnown for wide casts of colourful characters, challenging maps, permadeath, dozens of classes, and more recently matchmaking, the plots of political intrigue often get left out of the Fire Emblem discussion. A shame, because the writers over at Intelligent Systems have put together more than a few decent yarns over the series' 30-year+ history. As such, we expect this month’s Fire Emblem: Engage to have a great story as well, despite much of the conversation being focused on the protagonist’s toothpaste hair.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Eventually, I became a lead and then a QA manager at a studio,” she tells me, as we talk at India Game Developers Conference in Hyderabad, India. Now, Tiger is the lead producer for Crusader Kings 3. She even stood in front of a suit of armor to drop the game's first tease.\r\n\n\r\n An RPG-esque lifestyle system and neat backstab choices that deal with information round out Crusader Kings 3's host of improvements over its excellent predecessor. A court-themed expansion and a revamp of the game’s culture system shortly after launch are a testament to Paradox’s resolve to deliver a refined plotting experience. Holy wars and illicit affairs go hand in hand in the world of Crusader Kings and the third iteration is no different. Weaving together systems to consistently deliver emergent gameplay is no simple feat, and it turns out that production also covers all manner of small but essential, and practical things. As the lead producer on a game as complex as Crusader Kings 3, Tiger had her work cut out for her. \r\n\n \nRead more",

It was due for March, but this latest delay pushes it back to \"early\" in the financial year 2023-24, which begins in July.  \nAt least it's (sea)faring better than three other unannounced Ubisoft games, which have been cancelled thanks to Ubisoft's general underperforming sails.

The next 12 months is set to be a banner year for interstellar adventuring, and kicking us off in just under four weeks time on February 2nd is KeokeN Interactive's Deliver Us Mars. As I found out last year, Deliver Us Mars looks like it's going to be quite the step up from its prequel, Deliver Us The Moon, both in terms of its cerebral, pulse-racing puzzle-solving, and its shift from a silent, first-person protagonist to fully-voiced, third-person heroine, Kathy Johanson - a fact that game director and co-founder Koen Deetman tells me has been long in the making. \n\"You have to bear in mind that Deliver Us The Moon was our debut into the games industry,\" he tells me. \"We’d envisioned multiple ways to make this the greatest game of all time, but to some extent you are bound by reality and what you can make within a budget and timeline, so some of these decisions were made out of necessity. That’s why the narrative and its scale has significantly risen with Deliver Us Mars – we’ve had the opportunity to give that side of the game a lot of more of our time and attention.\" \nRead more",

WolfCl0ck claims this map is related to the prototype of Left 4 Dead, back when Turtle Rock was calling the project Terror Strike. You can watch the Zombie City mod in action below.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's a hybrid, really, of a Souls-ish game and a more traditional hack and slash action RPG. Regular attacks don't consume stamina, and instead of finding or buying weapons, you start out with a complete set, and swap their movesets in and out as needed.

When I first asked the team to put together their most anticipated games for 2023, I was thinking we'd have a reasonably sensible number of things we were all looking forward to, you know, somewhere in the region of the 43 games we highlighted at the start of 2022. Very quickly, though, it became apparent that, actually, there are simply loads of games the RPS Treehouse is personally excited about this year, and cor, it would be rude not to include every last one of them. I'll be upfront: there are a fair number of TBA games on here that probably aren't going to come out in 2023, but as ever, we remain hopeful and optimistic all the same. So let's dive in. \nRead more",

To umožní zahrnout kód v Rustu do binární verze prohlížeče Chrome během příštího roku. Začínáme pomalu a stanovujeme jasná očekávání ohledně toho, jaké knihovny budeme brát v úvahu, až budeme připraveni, vysvětlují vývojáři.",

          "description": "Fork over that extra dollar\nHBO has always been one of the pricier streaming services, but with shows like Succession, White Lotus, and the show that arguably kicked off the current golden era of television, The Sopranos, you're basically always guaranteed to get a good bang for your buck. We'll have to see if that holds true after yet another price increase, because the cost of HBO Max has risen yet again.\nThe change went into effect today, January 12, making the service's former $14.99/month price for the ad-free tier has increased $1 to $15.99. It's the first price hike since the launch of HBO Max back in March of 2020.\nhttps://twitter.com/hbomax/status/1613672303090335746\nWhile it's impossible to know for sure why the company decided to raise the price, there's a chance that they're simply keeping up with the rising costs of inflation, especially after their competitors like Netflix have done the same. Of course, it does seem a bit convenient that this change is happening only days before the premiere of The Last of Us TV adaptation on HBO Max, which will likely be one of the biggest streaming events of the year.\nThe show has been receiving rave reviews from critics, and as a fan of the series myself, I'll be interested to see how they translate such a beloved game to a live action television format. Here's hoping the price increase is worth it.\nThe post HBO Max price increases ahead of The Last of Us premiere appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A long-awaited reset\nAssassin's Creed is one of those game series that's been around for decades at this point, and in that time, the titles have evolved a lot. From the tightly-focused stories of its early days to its sprawling open world adventures in recent years, there's something in there for everybody. Long time fans of the games, though, have requested that the series take a step back and make a return to its older games, and this time, Ubisoft has taken fans' requests to heart.\nIn an interview with GamesRadar+, Assassin's Creed creative director Stéphane Boudon confirmed that while the series' sprawling titles like Odyssey and Valhalla are \"great games with the promise to live an epic journey in a strong fantasy,\" they will be pivoting to place a greater focus on \"character-driven story\" and \"the core pillars of the first ACs in a more intimate scale.\" This is music to my ears as a fan of shorter single player experiences, so I'll be excited to check out a new Assassin's Creed title that presents a more streamlined experience.\nhttps://twitter.com/assassinscreed/status/1568690133666340864\nUbisoft announced that Assassin's Creed: Mirage would be the next entry in the series last September, and soon after revealed that the game would follow Basim from Assassin’s Creed Valhalla. The story will follow his coming-of-age in the backdrop of ninth century Baghdad.\nAs much as I love hearing that Assassin's Creed is going back to its roots, part of me wonders if scaling back was a necessity first. Ubisoft's release lineup has already been hit by another wave of cancellations and delays, so cutting back to a smaller scale for the AC series would help relive some of the pressure on the development team. Whether it was a survival move or a creative on, I think it's a smart move -- players have been asking for more narrative-heavy AC games for years now.\nThe post Ubisoft says Assassin’s Creed: Mirage will be returning to the series’ roots appeared first on Destructoid.",

DualSense Edge features full programmable buttons, as well as adjustable trigger pressure, custom dead-zone positioning, and save states for different users and games. In addition, the DualSense comes with its own storage case, which doubles as a charging dock.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvmmWeov68s&ab_channel=PlayStation\nWhile an impressive piece of technology, the DualSense Edge comes at a cost, namely $199.99 USD, which equates to a staggering £209.99 GBP or €239.99 EUR, half the cost of the digital edition of the PS5 console itself. Sony has also noted that DualSense Edge will have a \"moderately\" shorter battery life than the original DualSense, which makes the new controller an exceptionally niche purchase.\nCan you put a price on adjustable Haptic Feedback? Sony sure has\nThe PS5 DualSense Edge launches January 26, exclusively on the PlayStation Direct store. It will be made available at other retailers, online and offline, from February 23.

The series has finally crossed over the four digit mark for their total number of pocket monsters -- a milestone they celebrated with an nine minute-long video. Another piece of information that shouldn't go overlooked, though, is that they also announced that another patch is on the way in a press release that came alongside the video. The Pokémon Company said that the update will be coming sometime in \"late February,\" although that's as specific as it gets for now.\n[caption id=\"attachment_358001\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1200\"] Image via Nintendo[/caption]\nScarlet & Violet have been heralded as some of the best entries in the series that we've seen in a few years, but it's undeniable that they got off to a rocky start. Since the release in November, there has already been a 1.1 patch to try to squash some of the games' myriad of bugs -- this new one coming up in February will be 1.2. The only details the press release divulges is that the update \"will include bug fixes and add functionality,\" but also says to \"please look forward to more details soon.\" Some players are hoping to finally see the update integrate Pokémon Go into the mainline series, but as of now, the integration of any new features outside of fixing issues and quality-of-life features is entirely up in the air.\nThe post Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s next bug-squashing patch is coming in February appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Sinister skin returns to Fortnite store\nThe sinister Plague Doctor skin has returned to the in-game store of Epic Games' juggernaut battle royale title, Fortnite. The purchasable costume has been conspicuous by its absence since January 2020, notably the same timeframe that saw the growing status of the global COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs noted by Eurogamer, the \"Scourge\" and \"Plague\" skins have made frequent appearances in Fortnite's rotational shop since their 2018 debut, available to purchase for 1500 V-Bucks each. But both outfits have been missing for two years, finally making a reappearance in-store earlier this week. The skins depict the frightening, beaked \"plague doctors\" of the 16th century, who would fill the beaked masks with herbal remedies in an effort to stave off infection as they visited the slums of working-class patients.\nWhile Epic Games never made any open statement as to the reasoning behind the costume's removal, it's not hard to imagine that somebody might have thought it a wise and prudent move to not fill the world's most popular video game with Plague Doctors during a period of global sickness.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is, of course, very much still with us, but enough time has passed that many companies and communities are readjusting to a \"Post-COVID\" status, though it should be clearly noted that the coronavirus and its variants are still infecting hundreds of thousands of people on a daily basis.

I'm looking at you, Agatha Harkness. The update is expected to launch on January 31, though the developers ask players for patience in lieu of any possible last-minute delays or pushbacks.\nIn addition to PvP Battle Mode, the new update will debut Marvel Snap's official rebalance system, known as \"Series Drop\". This semi-regular event will see higher-level cards — for example Series 3, 4, and 5 — drop a tier each, increasing their chance of appearance ahead of any newly debuting characters. The team is aiming for one Series Drop per month. It should be noted that the most powerful cards, such as Thanos and Galactus, will not be reduced in rarity. As these fellas are bad boys 4 life.\nFinally, Second Dinner notes that is currently investigating the rate at which Tokens are earned, in line with the price of in-store cards. The team hopes to come up with a fair and acceptable way to help Series 3 players push toward the upper echelons of Series 4 and 5 with less frustration. While no specific changes were announced, Second Dinner will continue to experiment with balance tweaks to help expedite progress.\nMarvel Snap is available now as a free-to-play title on iOS and Android devices.\nThe post Marvel Snap will launch its long-awaited PvP Battle Mode late-January appeared first on Destructoid.",

At this point the only thing left is a few odds and ends, as the game is set to launch just next week on January 20, 2023.\nUntil that time, there's a few minor commercials that have popped up on Nintendo's YouTube channel, which provide a closer look at some of the game's major mechanics, and cast.\nFire Emblem Engage Commercial 1\nThe first commercial provides a brief look at the setup of the narrative, which you're probably going to be skipping if you're going in blind. The fantastic elements and the more grounded kingdom hopping angle are briefly mentioned too, as well as quite a few closeups of bond system (including Alear, the main character, and Marth), and some combat animations. It's short, but to the point.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cj4yHLTCd9Y\nFire Emblem Engage Commercial 2\nThe next commercial focuses more on the party members/Emblem Ring conceit, and has a short \"tactics\" section that gives us some brief strategic gameplay. The core of this video lies in the opportunities to customize your party, which includes class types and Emblem Ring/Engage pairings (read: equipping party members with the spirits of classic Fire Emblem characters).\nMultiple heroes from prior Fire Emblem games are teased as well toward the end of the video.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5D8Qakq0GM\nWhile short, these clips get the gist of the new entry across.

I've had the phrase \"101\" embedded in my brain since Pokemon was first released in the '90s, and it's been hard to adjust ever since. When I first heard someone say \"there are over 200 Pokemon now in Gold & Silver,\" I wasn't ready for it. Now time has completely passed me by, and we're at 1008 Pokemon. Just....wow.\nYou can witness that passage of time in roughly nine minutes by watching the video below, which The Pokemon Company just put up on their official YouTube channel today. Here's a quick primer for the relatively straightforward clip: \"Twenty-six years after the release of the original Pokemon games—Pokemon Red Version and Pokemon Green Version in Japan—the number of Pokemon discovered has finally surpassed one thousand! Let’s celebrate the occasion with a look back at some of your favorite Pokemon!\"\nOf course, the big moment here is the \"1000th\" Pokemon, and that moment comes at roughly eight minutes in. From there they move on to the legendaries of the newest Paldea generation, which might be spoilerish somewhat if you haven't finished the game yet.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa08Y-fhfTI&t\nTime marches on, and so does Pokemon\nWe're at a crossroads for the series, especially with Pokemon Legends getting tons of praise on various \"best of\" lists, and Scarlet & Violet leaving a lot to be desired, from a good chunk of the fanbase.

But, as fans will know, the 2008 original was one of the finest examples of the genre, and there's no telling how studio Motive has been able to bolster the excitement, adventure, and nerve-wracking tension of Visceral Games' seminal work.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctQl9wa3ydE&t=78s&ab_channel=DeadSpace\nHaving been around the rumor mill more than enough times one would care to remember, the Dead Space remake was finally announced in the summer of 2021, with fans eagerly twiddling their thumbs for the past two years, eager to get their hands on the long-awaited title.

EA Sports told CBS Sports that celebration will be removed from the game relatively soon.\n\"EA Sports is taking steps to remove the celebration from Madden NFL 23 via an update in the coming days,\" a spokesperson told CBS.\nHamlin collapsed on the field during the Bills' game against the Cincinnati Bengals on January 2. He went into cardiac arrest, and personnel had to perform CPR on Hamlin.\nDamar Hamlin has since been discharged from a hospital in Buffalo and will continue rehabilitation at home.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlU-Fjm7_oA\nOn the field, off the field\nThis isn't Madden NFL's first time seeing real-world events collide with in-game features. EA removed former Las Vegas Raiders head coach Jon Gruden from Madden NFL 22 in 2021, following his resignation over remarks made in emails. Concussions and brain injuries have also been an ongoing topic for the Madden series, with some games working to address their portrayal of the issue.\nAnd for sports on a grander scale, world politics come into play. Electronic Arts removed the Russian national teams from games like FIFA and NHL in response to the invasion of Ukraine, in line with its partners at FIFA, UEFA, and the IIHF.\nThe post EA is removing Madden NFL 23 CPR touchdown celebration following Damar Hamlin incident appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "My two favorite things: gaming and sustainability\nMicrosoft has made it clear over the past few years that they're making an effort to help out the planet, and their newest movement toward their goal of being a \"carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste\" company takes the form of a brand new update that will impact how Xbox consoles consume power. The update will make Xbox consoles \"carbon aware,\" similar to an update that affected Windows 11 that was released last year.\nUpon a one-time download, the new Xbox update will automatically apply changes to the console's settings when it boots up. Major changes include consoles updating automatically to the Shutdown (energy saving) option, which means power consumption will be reduced while the console is turned off. This setting will cause the console to boot more slowly, but it will save 20x the amount of energy while active, Microsoft says. In addition, the Xbox will not wake at its usual nightly hours of 2-6am for maintenance, and will instead wake to perform updates at any time that uses the most renewable energy.\nhttps://twitter.com/Xbox/status/1613219312709554176\nOf course, these settings are entirely optional, and players can turn them off any time they choose. The aforementioned updates will be automatically applied for Xbox Insiders as of today, but Microsoft did include instructions for non-Insiders to implement these changes on their own when they become available in the future. For a full breakdown of these instructions and details of the entire carbon aware update, check out this post on the official Xbox blog.\nThe post Xbox aims to lower carbon emissions with default power-saving setting on consoles appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The OG Zelda game like we've never seen it before\nOf all the games to be modded into VR, the original Legend of Zelda game was near the bottom of my list in terms of expectations. Usually when a game goes VR, it's already got a 3D art style, but I have to admit adding a whole new dimension to a title, especially such a classic one, is a really intriguing idea. Now we get a chance to see what that experience is like, because Japanese modder and retro gaming enthusiast Sugar Noe posted a video of themselves playing The Legend of Zelda to both Twitter and YouTube, as originally reported by Nintendo Life.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vNA8-UE780\nIn 2021, a user named DeTwelve created a mod called The Legend of Doom, which faithfully recreates The Legend of Zelda in the engine of the original Doom. Then Sugar Noe took that mod and made their own tweaks so that it would be playable on a Quest VR headset. This thing has layers, but the final result has to make for one of the most immersive Zelda experiences ever.\nI played through The Legend of Zelda with a friend a few years ago on his SNES Classic, but admittedly I wasn't too intrigued considering how much the game showed its age, if you can pardon my blasphemy. We never finished it, but I will say that the added twist of playing it in VR might just be the push I need to get the very first Zelda game under my belt once and for all.\nThe post The Legend of Zelda in VR might be the push I need to finish the original game appeared first on Destructoid.",

One would assume that this also applies to online modes of Shredder's Revenge, so hopefully you have three pals all subbed to the streaming service if you want some handheld multiplayer action.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qcaEQVBcY0&ab_channel=Netflix\nTMNT: Shredder's Revenge sees the fab four team with Channel 9 reporter April O'Neil, sensei Master Splinter, and sporting goods vigilante Casey Jones on a mission to stop The Shredder and his Foot Clan from taking over The Big Apple. The game features a huge variety of cameos and references to Eastman and Laird's iconic 1987 TV series — including appearances from Bebop & Rocksteady, The Rat King, Irma, Vernon, and the Teenagers from Dimension X.\nThe mobile port is not currently in parity with the PC and console releases, sitting just one update behind. So while not all of the game's bugs and issues have been ironed out for the mobile port, the majority of features and modes are all present and ready to rock.

The long-in-development series, which will debut on the HBO network next week, sees beleaguered protagonists Joel Miller (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) pick their way through a dilapidated shell of the United States, attempting to stay one step ahead of thieving marauders and the terrifying mutated humans known as \"Clickers.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLtkt8BonwM&ab_channel=HBOMax\nThe HBO TV adaptation was first announced back in 2020, a seemingly snug fit for a game series so beholden to its distinct cinematic style. The show is produced by a litany of companies including Sony Pictures, Word Games, Naughty Dog, and the recently founded PlayStation Productions. The show itself is written by Craig Mazin, the Emmy award-winning creator of equally grim series Chernobyl, and Neil Druckmann, the writer of the video game iterations of The Last of Us and The Last of Us Part II.\nIf you're looking forward to the new show, then you won't have too much longer to wait. The first episode will air this Sunday, January 15, on HBO and HBO Max. In the UK, The Last of Us will air at 02:00 BST on Monday mornings via Sky Atlantic and NOW TV, to coincide with the U.S. timeslot. Don't fret staying up, as each episode will be made available on demand after its respective premiere.\nWe're about to hit a whole new wave of Last of Us discourse, folks. Batten down the fuckin' hatches.\nThe post The Last of Us TV adaptation receives overwhelming praise from critics appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, it seems that leadership at both Activision Blizzard and Proletariat itself are refusing to recognize the group on a voluntarily basis.\nIn a blog post signed by \"The Proletariat Leadership Team\", management states that rather than acknowledge the PWA, it instead wishes to hold a new, company-wide, anonymous vote, filed with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).

However, FF16 producer Naoki Yoshida isn't sure why. \nDuring a recent Final Fantasy XIV stream, Yoshida, who is a director on that game, was asked about rumors surrounding a PC version of FF16, and he responded, \"I don't know where the notion of a PC version releasing six months after the game is out came from as none of us have ever said that,\" according to a translator, as reported by Eurogamer. He followed it up with two instances urging fans to buy the PS5 version. \nAccording to a translation by Siliconera, Yoshida also said, \"There's been talk that the PC version will come out, but no one on the team has said anything about the PC version. I wonder why people assume the PC version will arrive six months after [the PS5 version], so just go ahead and buy a PS5.\" \nThe talk of a PC version of the game stems from a promotional PlayStation 5 video released last year that says in small print that FF16 will be a \"PS5 exclusive for six months.\" Some extrapolated from this small print that a PC release of the game will come after that six months of exclusivity is up, but if Yoshida's recent comments are any indication, the team has nothing to say in regards to a PC version. \nFinal Fantasy XVI hits PlayStation 5 on June 22. While waiting for more information, watch this \"Ambition\" trailer that reveals more about Valisthea's kingdoms, dominants, and eikons, and then check out our interview with Yoshida about the game's boss fights. \n[Source: Eurogamer]\nAre you picking up Final Fantasy XVI on PS5 or waiting for the rumored PC release?

I think of games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild when someone brings up weapon durability, as it was a hotly debated aspect of its release (I didn't mind it at all, personally). \nLove it or hate it, weapon durability is a feature that will likely never go away in games, and that's okay because when it's done right, it can be a helpful way to push players toward something new. In 2011's Dead Island, weapon durability was a big part of the experience, and that feature will return in Dead Island 2 when it hits PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and PC, on April 2…",

          "description": "Don't expect The Last of Us HBO show to extend beyond the story of the two games in the series. That's because The Last of Us game director Neil Druckmann says there are no plans for stories beyond the games in this show.\nThis news comes by way of a new interview with Druckmann from The Hollywood Reporter, as reported by GameSpot. Here's what Druckmann told THR specifically: \"We have no plans to tell any stories beyond adapting the games. We won't run into the same issue as Game of Thrones since The Last of Us Part: II doesn't end on a cliffhanger.\" \n\n\nDruckmann and TV series writer Craig Mazin have mentioned that a second season of this show might cover the events of The Last of Us Part II (personally, I think The Last of Us Part II could cover two seasons of television). Despite the duo not wanting the show to go beyond the games, there might be a way for the show to cover more ground after the events of The Last of Us Part II. If Naughty Dog were to develop a theoretical The Last of Us Part III, it wouldn't be surprising if the HBO show covered that down the road. Chances seem pretty good considering Druckmann told THR that there is \"more story to tell\" in the world of The Last of Us games. \nMazin also touched on his desire not to extend the show beyond the games in the THR interview, as noted by GameSpot, stating that he doesn't \"have any interest in a spinning-plates-go-on-forever show.\" \n\"When it becomes a perpetual motion machine, it just can't help but get kind of...stupid,\" he continued. \"Endings mean everything to me.\" \nFor more about The Last of Us on HBO, read our interview with Joel actor Pedro Pascal and Druckmann about the changes made for this TV show. Check out this new piece of concept art from The Last of Us multiplayer game that Naughty Dog is currently developing after that. \n[Source: GameSpot via The Hollywood Reporter]\nWhat scene are you most excited to see in The Last of Us on HBO?

This side-scrolling action title boasts plenty of satisfying action thanks to Kai’s fun melee combat, nimble platforming abilities, and his signature grappling hook, which he uses to traverse levels as well as yank and toss enemies. Sporting great 16-bit art and a strong soundtrack, Gravity Circuit is worth keeping an eye on for fans of classic throwbacks. \nJoin editors Wesley LeBlanc and Marcus Stewart as they explore Gravity Circuit’s free Steam demo and discuss why it may be one of the year’s most exciting indie gems.\n\n\nFor more previews of some of the biggest games of 2022 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Fire Emblem Engage, Clive 'N' Wrench, Inkulinati, Outer Terror, and more.",

That story is about the GT Academy contest, which was a real contest held between 2008 and 2016 by Sony and Nissan. Winners were given entrance into Nissan's Driver Development Program, as noted by Video Games Chronicle. The film appears to be telling the tale of someone who won entrance into this program and then went on to become a real success in the racing world. \nCheck out the Gran Turismo sneak peek for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, this sneak peek is a mix of what appears to be movie footage and behind-the-scenes footage, with stars like Harbour, Barnet, and Bloom talking about their excitement for the film. \nGran Turismo hits theaters later this year on August 11. \nAlongside this sneak peek, Sony also revealed that Gran Turismo 7, the latest in the long-running series released last year, will be getting an update that makes the game playable on its upcoming PSVR2 platform. \nWhile waiting to learn more about this Gran Turismo movie, read about Project Leonardo, a new customizable accessibility controller kit PlayStation unveiled yesterday and then read about how the PlayStation 5 has surpassed 30 million units sold. \nAre you excited about this Gran Turismo movie?

One of those updates involves a closer look at the upcoming standalone multiplayer title.\nIn a blog post, Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann reflects on The Last of Us’ legacy as well as the franchise’s future. In addition to the HBO adaptation premiering on January 15 and the PC port of The Last of Us Part 1 hitting in March, Druckmann states fans will learn more about the long-awaited multiplayer experience that serves as a follow-up to the original game’s Factions mode. Druckmann writes,\n“We’ll have some fun surprises for you along the way, but later this year we will begin to offer you some details on our ambitious The Last of Us multiplayer game. With a team led by Vinit Agarwal, Joe Pettinati, and Anthony Newman, the project is shaping up to be a fresh, new experience from our studio, but one rooted in Naughty Dog’s passion for delivering incredible stories, characters, and gameplay.”\nNaughty Dog also shares a new piece of concept art, posted in full below, which is the first new material of the game since it released the first concept asset last June. It depicts two survivors heading toward a dilapidated cruise ship. \nThough we’ll be learning more about the game this year, it’s still unknown if Naughty Dog plans to launch it in 2023. That would be fitting given the anniversary, but we'll have to wait and see over the coming months. Until then, be sure to check out this feature on how The Last of Us Part 1 proves there's no such thing as a faithful remake.",

News of this change follows the release of Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance's release last year, which didn't fare too well with critics and players, amidst Larian Studios' continued development on Baldur's Gate 3 (which does not seem to be affected by this reorganization despite WotC serving as the game's publisher). \nThese two games, in part, represented WotC's bigger forray into the video game space as Bloomberg reports that the company had signed contracts with several studios to make games. WotC also \"built at least six of its own game studios,\" according to the publication. \nOne project in the works that is now canceled went under the codename \"Jabberwocky,\" according to Bloomberg, and two more externally developed games early in development are no longer moving forward as well. These cancelations and layoffs comes as parent company Hasbro's shares fell 40% last year. \nWotc told IGN that it remains \"committed to using digital games as a cornerstone of our strategy for bringing our games to players around the world,\" adding that it has \"made some changes to our long-term portfolio to focus on games which are strategically aligned with developing our existing brands and those which show promise in expanding or engaging our audience in new ways.\" \n[Source: Bloomberg]",

In addition to showing off some new gameplay clips, it announces that the game will use NVIDIA DLSS3 technology, which a press release says will \"massively boost performance.\" You can watch the trailer below.\n\n\nAnnounced by NVIDIA last September, DLSS 3 can boost a game's performance by a significant margin. One demo on NVIDIA's site shows two instances of Cyberpunk 2077 running at 96 FPS with ray tracing still enabled. \"DLSS 3 allows the seemingly impossible, high framerate without compromising the visuals,\" Adrian Chmielarz, creative director and co-founder of The Astronauts says in a press release. \"A no brainer for a game like Witchfire, which is both action and beauty.\"\nWitchfire is a dark fantasy first-person shooter from the creators of Painkiller, Bulletstorm, and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. Set in an alternate reality, players are caught in the middle of a war between witches and the Church, and must use weapons and powers from Vatican sorcerers to defeat their enemies. \nThe game is set to enter Early Access in the Epic Games Store sometime later this year, though that wasn't always the case. It was delayed last October because the team decided to overhaul the world's design and make it more open. This trailer is a good indication that the studio is still hard at work, though; here's hoping that \"early 2023\" ends up being as soon as possible.",

According to a Twitter thread posted to the official Cult of the Lamb account, this update will introduce features many players have requested, including accessibility improvements, quality-of-life features, new difficulty options, and more depth.\nThis Major Content Update will release in 2023 and be FREE to all players!\npic.twitter.com/FWFW7sC7F0\nDecember 30, 2022\nThe biggest change they showcase in this thread is the introduction of heavy attacks, which can be activated by holding down the attack button. These are more than slow swings that do more damage; in Cult of the Lamb, every heavy attack has a unique effect. For example, the sword's heavy attack smashes the ground, doing an explosion of damage that harms any enemy caught in its range. Meanwhile, the dagger creates a line of knives that fall from the sky, and the axe can be thrown around like a boomerang. This is just the tip of the iceberg; developer Massive Monster says it's \"just one small tidbit\" of what's still to come.\nThe update should come soon, but not that soon. The last tweet of the thread clarifies that the developers are currently working on a patch to fix some console bugs and that the major update won't be released until after that. Their release window also isn't any more specific than \"2023,\" so it could come out any time this year.\nIf you're interested in learning more about the game, you can check out our review.\nWould a major update bring you back for more Cult of the Lamb?

Current Hitman 3 owners will get a free upgrade to Hitman World of Assassination on all platforms.\"\n\"We're drastically simplifying the purchase experience for new players. Hitman World of Assassination will be the single experience option to start playing.\" \n\n\nThis update makes it so that all Hitman 3 owners will have the same base content ownership, and it attempts to eliminate confusion over which edition to buy to obtain certain levels by making it so that there is only one purchase option. The other DLC will apparently still be available for purchase, but owning all the IO Interactive Hitman trilogy levels will be easier than ever now. \nHitman World of Assassination will cost $70, and it includes Hitman 3, the Hitman 1 Game of the Year Access Pass, and the Hitman 2 Standard Access Pass. You can also purchase the Hitman World of Assassination Deluxe Pack for $30 to get the Hitman 3 Deluxe Pack, the Hitman 3 Seven Deadly Sins Collection, and the Hitman 2 Expansion Access Pass. \n\"Those are the only two products that new players need to consider when buying any Hitman game digitially as of January 26, 2023,\" IO writes in a blog post. \"The changes have also been made with the Freelancer game mode in mind, where being able to easily access all locations from across the World of Assassination is parmount to maximizing your enjoyment.\" \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's Hitman 3 review and then read about the new Hitman 3 Freelancer mode.\nHave you played this Hitman trilogy?

Publisher Deep Silver released some spinoffs after Riptide, like Escape Dead Island, Dead Island: Epidemic, and the 16-bit beat ‘em up Dead Island Retro Revenge, but a full-scale, numbered sequel hasn’t yet happened, despite being announced nearly a decade ago. \nThe first iteration of Dead Island 2 was helmed by Spec Ops: The Line developer Yager, as Dead Island developer Techland had parted ways with the property and worked on Dying Light. Deep Silver then handed over development of the game to LittleBigPlanet 3 developer Sumo Digital in 2016, …",

The user didn't provide many details about the potential special edition Switch, but as you can see in the images below, the photos are quite believable.

However, elaborate and well-done fakes have been done before so there's no telling if this is actually real until we learn more information. It wouldn't be the most surprising thing ever, considering Nintendo tends to release special edition OLED models for big releases like this year's Splatoon 3 and Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. \nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom hits Switch on May 12 so it might be a while before we learn if this special edition OLED model is real.

          "description": "Metal Gear Solid creator and Death Stranding director Hideo Kojima and Metal Gear Solid publisher Konami parted ways with each other back in 2015 and since then, there hasn't been a mainline entry in the famed MGS series (although there was the not-so-great Metal Gear Survive in 2018). \nWhile there's no reason to believe Kojima and Konami are teaming up again anytime soon, it seems the latter might be preparing for some kind of return to MGS. Longtime MGS producer Noriaki Okamura wrote in a recent issue of Famitsu that \"2023 will be a year of many announcements,\" as reported by Gematsu. \nIn this special end-of-the-year issue of Famitsu, multiple Japanese developers and producers wrote quick teases about what 2023 might hold for them. It's here where Okamura teased that 2023 will be a year of announcements for Konami Digital Entertainment. More specifically, he said \"Other than [the educational edition of Momotaro Dentetsu announced last year], 2023 will be a year of many announcements,\" and that his keyword for 2023 is \"long-awaited,\" as noted by Gematsu. \nNow, this could just be his way of saying that Konami, as a whole, will make some announcements and that maybe some of them will be long-awaited by fans. However, given that it's Okamura – a longtime MGS producer – saying this, there's reason to believe that maybe he's teasing a return to the MGS series. Perhaps we're getting a remake of one of the games, or maybe a new mainline entry. Only time will tell. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's ranking of the Metal Gear Solid series. \n[Source: Gematsu]\nHow do you want to see the Metal Gear Solid series return?

The narrative-driven shooter is set in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone in a post-apocalyptic world laden with dangerous mutated monsters. Players must fight their way to the heart of the zone while steering the non-linear plot through choice-driven gameplay. \n\n\nFormally confirmed in 2020 after years of start and stop announcements, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 has had a tumultuous development. After announcing and quickly canceling NFT plans due to fan backlash in December 2021, the project came to a screeching halt in February due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, where GSC is based. Many employees were forced to evacuate their homes in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital. Other designers chose to defend the city. One of GSC’s designers who volunteered to fight, Vladimir \"Fresh\" Yezhov, was recently killed in combat. \nS.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl is slated to arrive on Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass) and PC in 2023. It was one of the many titles to get bitten by the delay bug and pushed into next year, a list you can check out here.",

Evath's moon Mitral has turned into a gigantic gas time bomb. A meteor is also due to impact Mitral in the next several hours. You were chosen to secure each of Mitral's 18 sectors by positioning a drilling rig over the gas pockets in each sector before the meteor strikes.\nSolve challenging riddles by relying on geological clues, intuition, or good old trial and error. To survive your mission, find Rubicon crystals to restore energy and destroy (or avoid) the Laser Beacons and Skanners left behind by the Ketars. Good luck!\nOur reimplemented engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Driller support is limited to DOS (EGA mode), Amiga and AtariST releases, but we hope to be able to add more soon! Please contact us if you have some other release.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build.
