          "description": "Destined to gather dust?\nAs we approach 2024, we're naturally getting increasingly keen to learn more about Nintendo's next major piece of hardware, affectionately dubbed the 'Switch 2', for now. After all, although the current line-up of upcoming Switch games is certainly nothing to sneer at, there's no denying that Nintendo is leaning heavily on remakes and remasters, presumably while its core teams work on 'next-gen' titles. If that doesn't indicate a new console is on the horizon, we're not sure what does.\nAt the moment, the majority of us are under the assumption that the 'Switch 2' will be a reasonably 'safe' upgrade to the current console in general form and function; a hybrid device that retains the core concept of the Switch but beefs up the performance considerably while possibly adding a few new innovations here and there. It makes sense, right? Although many of us are eager to move on to the next big thing, Nintendo isn't ready to ditch the Switch brand, and none of us want it to. It still works wonderfully after all these years, so why do anything drastically different?\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The last title to feature the onion-layered ogre was DreamWorks Super Star Kartz, released by Activision in 2011 for the Wii, Xbox 360, PS3, and 3DS. It’s somewhat fitting, then, that he would return in another DreamWorks karting game, and equally fitting that it too feels two generations old.\nDreamWorks All-Star Kart Racing is the latest offering from Bamtang Games, which was previously responsible for the Nickelodeon Kart Racers trilogy (which started weak on Switch, got better with the second game then lost its way again with the final entry). Sadly, while this DreamWorks-themed racer has a number of decent ideas, the execution is as sloppy as a Bergin eating a Troll.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Shigeru Miyamoto himself took to Twitter to share this news, stating that producer Avi Arad and director Wes Ball are already attached and it will be co-financed by Sony (a fact that we are still wrapping our heads around). Oh, and it is also going to be live-action. Let's not forget that bit.\nIf this were to be announced as an animated film, we would be on board in a heartbeat (heck, we have dreamt about a Studio Ghibli or even Sony Pictures Animation, Spider-Verse take on the series for years now) but live-action cinema comes with its own set of challenges. What does a 'real-life' Hyrule look like? Who really wants to see a realistically rendered Zora? And perhaps the most pressing issue of all: Who the heck do you cast in these beloved roles?\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Well, much like prior waves, we’d say this one lands somewhere in the middle, offering up a bunch of solid circuits mixed in with a few mildly disappointing ones.\nPretty much par for the course, then, but let’s just remind ourselves of what’s included with this one. You’ve got two new cups — the Acorn Cup and the Spiny Cup — made up of three Tour tracks and five ‘legacy’ courses from previous series entries. Oh, and you've four new characters to try out, too.

Many of his ideas for 2022's finest historical fantasy RPG have their twitching, eldritch roots in pen-and-paper sessions with friends. Take questions of money and wealth. Speaking to me over Zoom one rainy October afternoon, Aureus recalls one particular table-top campaign he ran in which, after 10 or so sessions, the player party had sunk into abject poverty. \"They reached a collapsed village, [and] they said, 'is there a cart around here?' So I rolled the dice and decided that all right, there is a wagon, that's completely functional with all its wheels and so on. So they just started to walk around and shove on the top of their wagon, whatever of value they could find. \r\n\n\r\n\"They had no shame!\" Aureus goes on. \"Just gathering all the scraps of iron, all the tools, knives, musical instruments, pieces of fabric - anything they could find, they were just taking it all with them on the assumption that whenever they reached a civilised spot, they're just going to sell it all.\"  This was foolhardy behaviour, because all the objects in question were trash with little resale value. \"So they at the same time they had more than they could ever need, and they had pretty much nothing. They mainly had a hindrance that was slowing them down - this wagon full of stuff was just difficult to move through the paths.\" \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Speaking to investors in an earnings call this week, GTA 6 publisher Take-Two's CEO Strauss Zelnick had a bit to say about the eternally uncontroversial topic of videogame prices. In news worth holding the press for, he thinks they're pretty cheap for what you get in return.\nZelnick cautioned one investor against \"generalising\" about the state of game pricing based on the recent fortunes of TV and movie subscription services like Netflix, which have had to increase subscription fees to match their expenses after underpricing themselves initially to grow their audiences. Videogames might be all about subscription services these days, Zelnick said, but that doesn't mean they are subject to the same commercial logics as ye olde non-interactive media. In particular, it doesn't mean publishers are currently able to raise videogame prices, even if they feel like they're overdelivering.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The fake video games in movies and TV shows can be difficult to understand, for an obvious reason: they're not real games. Their function is providing a few seconds of motion, colours, and noises, and possibly a premise for a plot to riff on. They don't need to be coherent or good. Still, sometimes these glimpses and ideas are interesting enough that I quite enjoy trying to figure them out. Take Gods Of Combat, a fake first-person shooter featured in police procedural show Criminal Minds. Apparently it's such a great game that the only way to achieve a similar high after being banned is hijacking a schoolbus and forcing teenagers to kill each other.\nHere's a fun (nonlethal) game we can play together, reader dear: I'm going to describe Gods Of Combat as best I can, then you tell me how you think it works.\nRead more",

          "description": "As a staunch Nintendo head in the early console days, I would say my affection for PS1-era games is... present, but not particularly palpable. For me, the PlayStation One was mostly a machine to play Final Fantasies VII through IX on, and not much else (it was a very belated and cheap second-hand purchase, I should note, and games were still sufficiently expensive back then that maintaining two healthy game libraries for both the family N64 and my new Squall box was nigh on impossible). Nevertheless, I've been increasingly fascinated by the revival of PS1-era games in recent years, and it's been interesting to see which modern games have been \"demade\" in this style - see Bloodborne PSX - and which ones have made it their own from the off - see Signalis, Heartworm, and many others. \nCrow Country is the latest game I've seen to take up the PSX mantle, and it combines the chunkiness of Final Fantasy VII-style character models with the grimy survival horror of something like Resident Evil to brilliant effect. Made by SFB Games, the same devs wot made the also excellent Tangle Tower, it's currently got a very good demo up on Steam at the moment, and it's got me thinking: what do you like most about PS1-era games on PC, and which ones are your all-time favs?\nRead more",

          "description": "World of Warcraft's expansion pack The War Within, out next year, comes in several flavours. There's the standard version of the pack, which includes access to previous expansions, currency for cosmetics and a level 70 character boost. The Heroic edition gives you all that plus a mount, a pet and extra in-game cash. And then there's the most expensive Epic edition, which includes a pet, two toys, 30 days of game time... and three days of early beta access to the game, yours for $89.99 in the states. \r\n\n\r\nNaturally, World of Warcrafters are rather concerned about the last bit. It's the first time Blizzard's long-running MMO has taken the paid early access approach, recently adopted by Starfield and Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 - there have been early access betas in the past, but they've been doled out by lottery. Blizzard's game director Ion Hazzikostas has now moved to reassure the grousers and gripers, promising that The War Within's Epic edition won't give minted early worms the edge over those poor peasants who scoop up the less pricey versions.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Yet there’s much, much more behind that screen that just some different diodes. This is a lighter, brighter, longer-lasting, sometimes even faster-running take on the SteamOS handheld, and one that sneaks in some surprise upgrades as often as it addresses issues with the original Steam Deck. I love it.\nRead more",

It’s a \"definitive\" refresh of the existing Steam Deck handheld PC that swaps the underwhelming IPS display for a brighter, more vibrant OLED panel, while making numerous battery life improvements – up to and including a new, more efficient AMD APU – that promise significantly more time away from the mains. It’s not far off either: the Steam Deck OLED’s release date is November 16th, just one week away.\nRead more",

As he makes clear to his army of Russian ultranationalists, he is interested only in their quiet, unwavering loyalty. Evidently, Activision expects much the same from its army of COD fans. This latest Modern Warfare campaign follows disconcertedly close on the heels of 2022’s entry because, as per Bloomberg, it began life as a mere expansion. Rather than allow a fallow year, Activision has upgraded that expansion’s status to a premium release, and charged $69.99 for pre-orders - granting early access to the single-player campaign as an enticement.\r\n\n\r\nInstead of Modern Warfare’s usual lead studio, Infinity Ward, development duties have fallen to Sledgehammer, the outfit most recently responsible for 2021’s unloved Vanguard. And in an industry where AAA FPS games now regularly take half a decade to make, this campaign has reportedly come together in less than two years. Reader: it shows.\r\n\n \nRead more",

A faked death finally saw him freed from the shackles of the yakuza with one big catch: he couldn't ever see his family again. Since then, we've had the plucky Ichiban take on the mantle of Tojo Clan nastiness in Yakuza: Like A Dragon (7), with its sequel Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth (8) set to wash up on Hawaii's shores next year. What do we know about Infinite Wealth? Kiryu is set to return as a protagonist alongside Ichiban, with an all-new haircut. And more importantly, what has Like A Dragon Gaiden got to do with any of this? Well, it's a shorter stop-gap between the events of Yakuza 6 and Yakuza 8 that fills us in on what Kiryu's been up to this whole time.\nBut aside from moreish minigames and a fantastic Agent persona with web-slinging abilities, Kiryu's epilogue is a far cry from Yakuza's best stories. By no means is it bad, it just isn't the best introduction to the series for newcomers, and even longtime fans will struggle balancing his resurrection with its heavy feelings of repetition.\nRead more",

I want someone who really, really loves and hates things, and gives you reasons why.”\nIt’s a trait which Giovannetti has in common with his Megacrit co-founder, Casey Yano, and has possessed ever since he was a kid growing up in Woodinville, 30 minutes outside Seattle. It’s matched by a competitiveness that first emerged in Warhammer 40,000 tournaments as a teen. Before he was old enough to drive, Giovannetti would ride his bike to the local game store and play until the early hours of the morning.\nRead more",

          "description": "GTA 6 publisher Take-Two Interactive’s CEO Strauss Zelnick has been on the blower to the company’s investors about the idea of making games using the latest artificial intelligence content generation tools. Echoing his relatively guarded enthusiasm for NFTs a couple of years ago, he’s sort of mixed on them, regarding AI tools less as transformative technologies than simply the latest step towards the eternal industry objective of More, Faster And Better For Less.\nZelnick thinks automated learning and generation tools will make development more “efficient” and games, overall “better”, but in terms of Take-Two’s own bottom line, any gains will likely be offset by the fact that other big companies have access to the same tools, and by the fact that Take-Two will take advantage of said efficiencies by setting more ambitious goals. As such, he doesn’t think using generative AI will lead to lower prices for big commercial games. If you’re a developer that can’t afford to buy or license generative “AI” tools, Zelnick added, you can expect competition to become “more intense” in the coming years. Good stuff. \nRead more",

It’s the brand-new remake of the grand old mystery puzzler The 7th Guest, a game which Bill Gates notably referred to as “The new standard of interactive entertainment.” In fairness to ol’ William, he said this seven months before Doom blew out the new standard’s insides with a 12-gauge shotgun, shunting PC gamers’ tastes away from kitsch adventure games and toward grisly murder-fests. But The 7th Guest is nonetheless fondly remembered for its spooky atmosphere, alongside its blend of pre-rendered backgrounds and live action cutscenes you could call ‘pioneering’ had it not proved such an evolutionary dead end.\nToday, the original 7th Guest looks more dated than Henry VIII, which is probably why this remake replaces everything but the very skeleton of the 1993 original. The game still takes place in a creepy mansion belonging to a murderous toymaker, and still involves six eccentric guests to the house searching for a missing boy named Tad. But it’s otherwise been completely rebuilt, with whole new puzzles and whole new mechanics, all designed to be experienced in first-person VR.\nRead more",

I've long admired their intricate dances of orbs and criss-crossing laser fire, but I have long resigned myself to merely being a spectator of such games, rather than an active ship pilot. Cobalt Core, however, is exactly my kind of speed. It's not a bullet hell shooter, but it is about two spaceships facing off against each other in an eyes-locked duel of incoming cannon fire, and sliding side to side to avoid getting exploded as you attempt to unravel the mysterious timeloop your crew of weird space animals appear to be stuck in. Just, you know, in a neat, turn-based fashion, where your opponent's attacks are flagged up in advance, and you must use your randomised deck of cards to weave and dodge your way to victory. It's very moreish, and very Into The Breach. I love it. \nRead more",

          "description": "When I reviewed Hunt: Showdown for a different parish back in 2019, it was a swampy, stealthy, slow-paced extraction FPS that consisted of weaving through mouldy undead and pockets of inconveniently noisy wildlife, ears pricked for the rustle of a rival player in the bushes. It was a game in which every footfall felt like a gamble and every second lasted an eternity, even before you entered the lair of a giant spider. Fast  forward to 2023, and streamers are playing Hunt: Showdown like it's Titanfall 2, scurrying along walls with scant regard for the NPC cannon fodder below, duelling each other on rooftops with pistol shotguns, and tearing through those poor, befuddled boss monsters like sandcastles.\r\n\n\r\nThus the fate of any competitive shooter lucky enough to acquire a seasoned pro following, I guess. But still, returning to Crytek's PvPvE shooter has been a shock, and speaking to the development team, it sounds like the devs themselves have been struggling to keep up with the more ambitious players, too. Showdown was never expected to endure quite this long and evolve in quite this way, according to general manager David Fifield, and managing the community's ambitions for the game is as much of a challenge as compensating for the limitations of its ageing engine.\r\n\n \nRead more",

We will, however, be returning with a fresh set of monthly game selections in 2024, so you can look forward to more group play-a-longs and liveblog chats early next year.\nIn the meantime, though, we hope you've enjoyed this first year's outing of the RPS Game Club, and we'd love to get some feedback on it for how we can improve next year.

Every day you get a few different puzzles, with a subscription model offering bonus puzzles. I've not subbed because I'm just not built for anagram puzzles and I do not understand chess, which form about half of the daily offering, but I enjoy doing the daily fliparts and crosswords a lot.

But just because something is bad, doesn't mean it's uninteresting. Having watched dozens of movies and episodes with fake video games, I'm going to celebrate a few over the coming weeks. Some daft fake games have neat ideas, some shows portray their fake games in an interesting way, and some fake games are even quite good. Let's start now with Deadware, an unknown horror movie which does a great job recreating something a bit bad: a spOooky haunted browser game from 1999.\nRead more",

Sure, there’s the looming threat of Garlean invasion and/or the possibility of world destruction throughout A Realm Reborn and its expansions - but on the plus side, almost everyone you meet is up for a round of cards.\r\n\n\r\nOver the last quarter-century, Triple Triad has managed to escape its origins as a fun side minigame in Final Fantasy VIII to become a fully-fledged phenomenon in XIV. The Gold Saucer runs regular tournaments, random strangers are happy to be challenged to a match - often throwing in one or more of the game’s many variant rules (though Chaos can do one) - and might even give up one of their prized cards when defeated, with almost 400 to collect as of the game’s latest patches. Emphasis on the “might”: I dread to think of the hours spent replaying NPCs in the hope of a random drop as I filled out my collection.\r\n\nI headed along to Final Fantasy’s London Fan Fest last month with a fetching deck of Triple Triad cards in hand. (Square Enix provided entrance and accommodation for the event.) Where better to try and live the dream of challenging random strangers to a card game, and learn more about the community that has fallen in love with the MMO in the 10 years since A Realm Reborn released?\r\n\n \nRead more",

In all honesty, I'm kinda obsessed with Starfield's food in a more general sense, and I have almost as many screenshots of its tube-like meal boxes, stale toast slices, vacuum-packed sachets of rice balls, steak slabs and spiced worms - and, of course, Chunks - as I do its planets and NPCs. I'm weirdly fascinated by what Bethesda think our future meals will look like when we eventually start travelling across the stars, and not just because I like ragging on their somewhat plastic-looking textures and marvelling at how everything from orange juice to beer and wine comes in kid's size cartons with a little straw on the side. \nChunks are my favourite food of the lot, though. These cubes of faintly glistening organic matter are bite-sized monstrosities that are quite possibly some of the most unholy things I've ever seen. How this became the dominating foodstuff across the known galaxy is a mystery worthy of its own sidequest, because let's be honest, I'm all for eating wonky fruit and vegetables, but would you truly go to shop, sit down at a table and order an apple that's been squeezed into a perfect cube? Or a cube with yellow skin that professes to call itself grilled chicken? I would probably try them once for curiosity's sake (it's the food of the future, of course I want to know what that tastes like!), but it's also exactly the kind of thing I'd swear off immediately because nope, nuh uh, I just can't even contemplate it anymore. And then it dawned on me: this is exactly how I feel about Starfield as a whole.\nRead more",

Activision have now posted an explanation for the heavier footprint of this year's Call of Duty, while pointing out that you can customise your install to lighten the load.\nRead more",

          "description": "Like when Sir Alex Ferguson oversaw his final game at Old Trafford, there’s a complicated atmosphere surrounding this year’s Football Manager. Football Manager 2024 is the last iterative game in the series before Project Dragonfly arrives next year, through which Sports Interactive plan the most radical overhaul of the game since the introduction of the 3D match engine in FM 09. This includes a complete rebuild of Football Manager in Unity, implementing brand new animation technology, and the inclusion of women’s football. But there is a reason why the studio has stuck with this tried and tested formula for so long. Big changes come with big risks, and as any Man Utd fan will know, those changes don’t always pay off.\r\n\n\r\nBut such concerns are for the future. FM24 is with us right now, and while it may be swapping the dugout for the stands ninety minutes from now, this isn’t some ceremonial exhibition match. It’s business as usual, and in mostly good ways. Sports Interactive have made meaningful changes to the management game both on and off the pitch, all built on top of fundamentals that remain as complex and compulsive as they have for years. That said, FM24 also demonstrates why a change is welcome, as in its current form it can struggle to strike the balance between authenticity and fun.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I rarely replay games, let alone horror games, which are often one-and-done sorts of things - though I do, of course, enter the Pumpkin Carving Festival every year.\nI want something that has a general air of spookiness without being a jumpscare frightfest.

We discuss the arrival of AI voices in big-name games, the disappointingly businessy thinking behind it, and whether we can think up some uses for AI-generated material that we can actually get behind. All sparked by voice actor Gianni Matragrano’s video compilation of the lines in question, which you should probably watch before listening to this episode, or there’ll be a bit where Nate appears to bellow \"THE KING FISH\" for no reason. Well, maybe not no reason. It’s still Nate.\r\n\n\r\nPlus! We talk about what we’ve been playing this week, which coincidentally for me was The Finals, while Nate’s been digging deeper into the Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor demo. I also recount the teeth-based controversy surrounding Cities: Skyline 2, in turn begging the question: what are they going to do with all those teeth? \r\n\n \nRead more",

Get in your pajamas, order some pizza, and let’s get into some Super Smash T.V.\n\n\nSmash T.V. was originally released in arcades in 1990. It was designed by the legendary Eugene Jarvis, the guy behind 1981’s Defender. More importantly, he created 1982’s Robotron: 2084, which is the godfather of twin-stick shooters. Smash T.V. was built as a spiritual successor to that game, so it has all the features you’d expect, which is to say, it is also a twin-stick shooter.\n\n\nSuper Smash T.V. is the title used by the SNES, Genesis/Mega Drive, Master System, and Game Gear versions. What makes it “Super?” Nothing. Absolutely nothing. It’s just a straight port of the arcade title.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nGo! …",

          "description": "Great Pretender, the exciting heist anime that was made available via Netflix in the Summer of 2020, could be teasing another season to be announced very soon. In a post made via Twitter, the official Great Pretender account reveals a “new release” will be announced on November 18 at Anime NYC.\n\n\nIn the post, an 18-second video serves as a highlight reel of the first season’s exploits, with the tagline “the greatest con artists return to the party,” which seems like a strong gesture towards another season.\n\n\n\n\nIn any case, the announcement will take place at a special panel held from 12:45 p.m. to 1:45 p.m. ET in Panel Room 1. The panel is set to feature George Wada, the president of Production I.G. and Wit Studio; Hiro Kaburagi, the director of Great Pretender; and Hitoshi Ito, the anime’s producer. According to Anime NYC’s website, those in attendance will be “invited to be the first to watch the world premiere and win some specially prepared presents from the guests.”\n\n\nAs stated, Great Pretender was released globally via Netflix on August 20, 2020. It ran for 23 episodes across four story arcs, with each arc covering a unique heist for the primary characters to pull off. I don’t wanna spoil it for anyone reading, but if this announcement is indeed a second season, let’s just say it’ll be more than welcomed with the ending of the season finale taken into account.\n\nThe post Great Pretender teaser hints at an Anime NYC reveal for the heist series appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Netflix's gaming push is looping in one of its larger animated properties. The Dragon Prince: Xadia is a new action-RPG in development, arriving next year on mobile through Netflix.\n\n\nThe project looks to be handled by Wonderstorm, per the official site, and definitely takes after the action-RPG genre. In the reveal trailer, we can see quite a few gameplay moments that feel reminiscent of Diablo, Hades, and the like.\n\n\n\n\nCharacters look to run around, bash enemies' heads in, and unleash magic upon the battlefield. Netflix's teaser describes the game as a \"hack & slash looter ARPG,\" and also notes you can team up with friends. Feels very Diablo-y to me.\n\n\nFor the roster, I see a few expected faces, including leads like Callum and Rayla. I'm admittedly a bit behind on the show, but it's nice to see the breadth of choices here. The shield-toting Amaya is a very welcome inclusion, too.\n\n\nNetflix and games\n\n\nThe online streaming giant Netflix has been steadily making headway in the realm of games. It has a mobile service which has featured access to some notable titles, like 2018 gem Spiritfarer.\n\n\nThe company's also making its own big push into games, through internal measures and external acquisitions of studios like Spry Fox and Oxenfree maker Night School Studio. Joseph Staten, of Halo/343 fame, was even brought on as Netflix Games' creative director.\n\n\nIt does seem like Netflix continues to be interested in games, both on their own and as properties for streaming shows. Whether these efforts pan out will be interesting to see, but it's at least a good sign that Netflix's game service has eschewed the microtransactions that typically plague mobile offerings. Because of that, this Dragon Prince ARPG on-the-go could be one to watch.\n\nThe post Netflix’s The Dragon Prince is getting a Diablo-esque mobile game appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Xbox console versions of Baldur's Gate 3 are on their way. And it looks like the optimizations made for the Xbox Series S version of BG3 may have some benefits for other platforms, too.\n\n\nLarian Studios head Swen Vincke shared a look at some graphs for the upcoming port of Baldur's Gate 3. Notably, the graphs highlight how the optimizations being made are addressing an overall Baldur's Gate 3 speedbump: memory.\n\n\n\"Ensuring memory is well under control and having buffer for peaks was the main thing holding us back I think this will benefit all platforms too,\" Vincke writes. \"Still some work left but very close now.\"\n\n\n\n\nA new horizon for Baldur's Gate 3\n\n\nThe Xbox Series versions of Baldur's Gate 3 are still coming along but planned for this year. While the massive RPG hit PC and PS5 earlier this year, the Xbox version was held off for some time, citing concerns about the Series S, a compromise was finally reached: allowing the Series S version to launch without split-screen co-op.\n\n\nWhile the issues initially surrounded parity, seeing as the Series S is a step behind both the Series X and PlayStation 5, it looks like optimizing that port might be beneficial for all. The improvements in VRAM and RAM shown above definitely seem enticing, and if this makes my PC run BG3 better, then I'm all for it.\n\n\nPlus, it means many more people will be able to play Baldur's Gate 3. Despite a frankly crowded year for big releases, Larian's RPG has been a huge hit for players, including myself. Getting Baldur's Gate 3 on Xbox Series S consoles, and optimizing it more in the process, seems like a real win-win.\n\nThe post Larian shares an update on Baldur’s Gate 3 Xbox Series S optimization appeared first on Destructoid.",

The studio has confirmed that Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time is being pushed into 2024.\n\n\nThe team says it's pushing the Switch game back to ensure Fantasy Life i is released \"in better quality to everyone.\" No firm release date for next year's been set, but we'll be hearing about it soon. Level-5 is holding another Vision 2023 event later this month on November 29, where it plans to announce the new release date for Fantasy Life i.\n\n\n\n\nWhat's ahead for Level-5\n\n\nConsidering a number of Level-5's other projects are all still labeled 2023—and we're running out of 2023 with each day that passes—I wouldn't be surprised to see some other windows shift. If anything's left to launch this year, there's not a lot of time left.\n\n\nThat said, this reinvigorated Level-5 is exciting to see come together. While the studio's been largely working on properties like Ni no Kuni and Yo-Kai Watch for the last few years, they've now got a hefty lineup of both familiar and fresh games. One in particular, Decapolice, has really caught my eye, and reportedly looked good at Tokyo Game Show 2023.\n\n\nMy hope is that Level-5 gets the time to comfortably make what they want to. This studio produces some wild, wonderful worlds that are a blast to explore, and both Fantasy Life i and its other games look really intriguing.

On that note, Samurai Punk—the studio behind several indie games including Killbug and Screencheat—has announced its closure in a post via Twitter.\n\n\n\n\nIn the post, the team celebrates an impressive decade-long run as a studio, and notes that “it’s been an amazing run and we’d like to thank our team past and present; the 9 incredible games we’ve made wouldn’t have been possible without them.” \n\n\nIn speaking of the team, Samurai Punk has created a Google doc with the information for those affected by this closure. “These incredible folks will now be looking for new roles, so if you have roles available or know of any openings, please contact us or the individuals directly.”\n\n\nSamurai Punk was established in 2014, and is responsible for Screencheat, as well as The American Dream, Feather, Roombo: First Blood, and Killbug, among others. It is by no means the only studio that has suffered a closure in 2023 — some examples include Dillon’s Rolling Western developer Vanpool, Boomerang X developer Dang!, and the Embracer Group-owned Volition Games, who made Saints Row.\n\n\nIt genuinely hurts me to hear news like this, especially when games like Screencheat somehow manage to fly under my radar all this time.

It’s set to release on PC sometime in 2024.\n\n\nHollywood Animal is a narrative management sim where you try to run a movie studio with as few scruples as possible. Manage staff through gifts or blackmail, create movies to gain favors, but just keep things as profitable as possible. Craft art, build stars, or simply find their dark spots so you can stick a hook in and make them dance.

By the looks of all the systems show off, it’s really quite complex. It takes you through the ages as you try to keep your studio afloat while not bringing too much attention to your shady dealings. Select the director, the writers, and the actors, and then try to keep them all happy (or at least complacent). Navigate the changing political landscape of the ages.\n\n\nI am so on board with this.

It appears Unity may be the next to suffer layoffs as it attempts to become a \"leaner, more agile, and faster growing company.\"\n\n\nIn a shareholder letter, Unity CEO James Whitehurst claims that the company has a big opportunity to grow in the future, though that may be difficult at present because the team is trying to do too much at once. As Whitehurst explains, \"we are not achieving the synergies that exist across our portfolio, and we are not executing to our full potential.\" \n\n\nThird-quarter financial results are described as \"mixed.\" The strategy to make the company leaner will include increasing focus on its main projects such as the Unity Editor. Though nothing is set in stone yet, the plan will likely involve discontinuing certain products, reducing the business's office footprint, and reducing the size of the workforce. \n\n\nThe letter also addressed the controversy surrounding the announcement of runtime fees. Whitehurst acknowledges that \"the execution created friction with our customers and near-term headwinds.\" Despite this, there's no indication of any intentions to back down. The event is described as \"now mostly behind us,\" though it is expected that because of the controversy, the new business model will be minimally beneficial in 2024 until customers adopt Unity's new releases.\n\n\nNo date is given regarding when these interventions will be implemented but further guidance will come with the fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. \n\nThe post Unity warns of likely layoffs following runtime fee decision appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, that's all about to change as the game's creator Jonathan Blow has recently announced an Anniversary Edition coming in 2024.\n\n\nReleasing April 30, this new version of Braid comes with improved visuals and animations, areas that have been \"re-envisioned to make them more unique,\" and more than 15 hours of commentary. If you're interested in the world game development, that last one may be of interest to you.\n\n\n\n\nThis special Anniversary Edition – which is launching to celebrate 15 years of Braid – is coming to PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, iOS, Android, and even Netflix. It'll also be available on PS4 and Xbox One, with Linux and Mac ports coming later on.\n\n\nConsidered a \"masterpiece\"\n\n\nOriginally released on Xbox 360 in 2008, Braid has been described as one of the greatest independent games of its generation. It won several awards and was the second-largest-selling game on Xbox Live Arcade. It has a Metacritic score of 93.\n\n\nIts developer Blow is no stranger to the video game world. Some of his earlier work includes being a programmer on Oddworld: Munchy's Oddysee and Deus Ex: Invisible War. He released the puzzle title The Witness in 2016.\n\n\nHe's also gained something of a reputation over the years, often being held aloft as an outspoken critic of the gaming industry. He was described in a 2016 New Yorker article as a \"prickly genius,\" while an interview with Kotaku in 2011 said Blow's opinions are not aimed at individuals, but at \"trends.\" He's also no stranger to making public controversial statements over the years, further complicating his legacy.\n\n\nIn any case, Braid is often signposted as an indie release that helped shape an industry of indie releases. This was before Minecraft did it. If you still haven't played the game (guilty), April's Anniversary Edition is definitely one to look out for.\n\nThe post Braid current-gen release coming April to celebrate 15th anniversary appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "[Update: The full song has been released! You can find it on YouTube as part of this Game Changer album playlist, as well as via the embedded video below. The album can be found on iTunes and BandCamp.]\n\n\n\n\nThe Grammy award-winning The 8-Bit Big Band and Lawrence are releasing a new cover of the Marvel vs Capcom 2 song \"I Wanna Take You for a Ride.\" It's been covered many times by the VGM community, but in this instance, new verses and a bridge accompany the admittedly repetitive tune. \n\n\n\n\nMarvel vs Capcom 2 jam gets taken for a ride\n\n\nDespite the original release from Marvel vs Capcom 2 repeating the same line over and over again, it's one with a special place in fan memories with a funky beat too delicious to ignore. Thankfully, The 8-Bit Big Band and Lawrence bring their own vision to the bop with a full song based on the loop. This version adds new lyrics, verses, and a bridge next month on November 10.\n\n\nThe 45 seconds released on social media from The 8-Bit Big Band has an outstanding suite of brass instruments and thrilling vocals. Almost time for MAHVEL, baby. \n\n\nLast year, the 8-Bit Big Band (and Button Basher) won a \"Best Arrangement - Instrumental or A Capella\" Grammy for its cover of \"Meta Knight's Revenge\" from Kirby Super Star. Since its release in 2021, the theme received over 1 million views on YouTube.\n\n\nPerhaps with this upcoming Marvel vs Capcom 2 cover, they'll get another Grammy. Nevertheless, The 8-Bit Big Band has an upcoming show in New York on December 15. Its fourth album, \"Game Changer,\" accompanies the Marvel jam on November 10. \n\nThe post The 8-Bit Big Band and Lawrence transform popular Marvel vs Capcom 2 song (Update) appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Fallout 76 was released on November 14, 2018 in a wretched state, and I absolutely cannot believe it's been five years since then. While most publishers would have buried it and moved on, the creative team got to work and the funding arrived to salvage the game. To celebrate, in-game events are on the way.\n\n\nFallout 76 5-year anniversary event details\n\n\nWe're not getting a massive quality of life overhaul or DLC per se, but there will be a streaming event on Twitch on Tuesday November 14 at 3PM ET, as well as a birthday event from now through November 21 at 12PM ET.\n\n\nHere is the full rundown of the stream from Bethesda:\n\n\n\n\"Organized by our friends at Fallout for Hope, we have over 40 floats, live music, Atom giveaways and more! Did we also mention that Adrienne Barbeau, who you know as the voice of the Overseer, will be doing a S.P.E.C.I.A.L. introduction speech? And who better to narrate the parade than Wes Johnson himself? Wes Johnson who you know as the voice of… well… all our favorite robots! Protectrons, Fasnacht Paraders, Nuka-World's Dr. Del Walsh, and many more! (No, seriously, look him up we love his voice!)\"\n\n\n\n\nFallout 76 is in good company, alongside No Man's Sky and Final Fantasy XIV (1.0)\n\n\nWhile there was no excuse for the state it was launched in, Fallout 76 gets high marks on its report card in the BUG (bring-up-grades) section. The team actually committed to making the game better, and while it took nearly two years to add NPCs (the turning point for 76), they came all the same. It sounds rediculous, adding in content that seems standard for open world games, but such was the early state of Fallout 76.\n\nThe post Fallout 76 is 5 years old and still somehow kicking appeared first on Destructoid.",

Player morale is at an all-time low, tanking after a round of Bungie layoffs and news of a reported delay for the upcoming The Final Shape expansion. And while Bungie is using the delay to double down on ensuring the new expansion is a smash hit, serious concerns about Destiny's longevity are cropping up.

          "description": "With the Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer announcement being made recently, all eyes are once again on Rockstar's behemoth franchise. Not that eyes were ever truly off it. GTA 5 is still doing phenomenally well, as outlined in Take-Two Interactive's recent figures.\n\n\nAccording to conference call notes uploaded a couple of days ago, Grand Theft Auto 5 has now sold approximately 190 million units since it launched in 2013. Compare this to November 2022's prepared remarks – when it had sold 170 million – and it's obvious the game is still selling in droves.\n\n\nAt this rate, it could well fly past the 200 million mark, maintaining its stance as the second highest-selling game after Minecraft (which recently hit 300 million).\n\n\nBetter be worth the wait\n\n\nGTA 6 is still pretty elusive. Aside from the leak in 2022, we really don't know much about the hugely anticipated follow-up. Rockstar has promised the first official trailer in December, so at least we have that to look forward to.\n\n\nIt's a tall order to be the next big thing after Grand Theft Auto 5, but after years of speculations, leaks, and the collective will of gamers everywhere, the world is finally ready for the next installment.\n\n\nIt's tempting to say that once the sixth game comes out, sales of GTA 5 may slow down significantly. However, Rockstar's not above rehashing some of its older (and more lucrative) titles, so who knows what the studio has planned for the game. There's still some milking to be done for that proverbial cash cow.\n\nThe post GTA 5 is getting closer to 200 million units sold appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It's pretty well known that Bethesda nearly had a voiced protagonist in Starfield. The developer decided against it in the end. However, did you know that one of those actors could well have been the voice behind Adam Jensen?\n\n\nIn a recent post on Twitter/X, Elias Toufexis, who takes on the role of the main character in the two most recent Deus Ex games, said he was originally going to voice the Starfield hero.\n\n\n\n\nHe also said that Cissy Jones – another prolific video game voice artist – was originally planned to play the protagonist, presumably the female version. However, while Bethesda did scrap the idea in the end, we did still get to hear both actors, with Toufexis playing Sam Coe and Jones playing Andreja.\n\n\nWould it have been better?\n\n\nWith the exception of Fallout 4, Bethesda games typically have a silent main character. Many argue this helps with immersion. It could also be a time, money, and labor-saving decision at the hands of the studio.\n\n\nIn any case, Starfield having a mute protagonist is par for the course for Todd Howard and his team. We could be looking at a different experience if we had Toufexis' gravelly dialogue guiding us through the cosmos.\n\n\nDespite major hype for the game, Starfield doesn't feel like it has the staying power of something like Skyrim. It's still a good sci-fi game – and the continuous updates will only improve things – but it might be a stretch to think of it as a potential Bethesda classic in years to come.\n\nThe post Starfield very nearly had you playing as the voice of Deus Ex’s Adam Jensen appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Today Sony revealed that it’s shifting its strategy with live service games. The company is scaling back the number of live service games it plans by fiscal year 2025 to launch by half.\n\n\nIn case you didn’t remember, just last May Sony announced ambitious plans to release a total of 12 live service games by the end of its fiscal 2025. In theory, having a deep catalog of live service titles would give Sony a steady stream of income from players who fully bought into their favorite games. Now, Sony seems to be acknowledging that creating that deep catalog is easier said than done. \n\n\nIn a November 9 earnings call, Hiroki Totoki, COO, CFO, and President of Sony, elaborated on what led to this change in plans. Totoki said that after Sony acquired Bungie last July, the company had the developer help refine its plan for live service games. Ultimately, Totoki said that Sony realized it’s previous plan wouldn’t be able to produce satisfactory games. \n\n\n“We have not been able to meet the gamers’ expectations,” Totoki said, “But we are trying as much as possible [to ensure these games will] be played by gamers and liked by gamers for a long time.” To make that happen, Totoki said, “six titles will be released by FY25. That’s our current plan.” \n\n\nThe other six live service games aren’t going anywhere just yet. Totoki said that the company is still deciding when those games will be released, but for now it will focus on making sure the first six games are as good as possible. He didn’t mention which games made the cut for the initial six, so the fate of specific titles like The Last of Us multiplayer, which was delayed earlier this year, is still up in the air. \n\nThe post Sony delays half of its 12 planned live service games appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "As part of today’s Netflix Geeked event, the streamer confirmed that Arcane Season 2 will be out in November 2024. In the 15-second long teaser, we can see Jinx solemnly walking towards what appears to be the Bridge of Progress in Piltover, but it’s surrounded in an ominous shade of crimson.\n\n\n\n\nIn the teaser, we can hear Jinx humming the melody line from “The Bridge,” which is featured in the score for the first season. Behind that, her footsteps echo and what could be the environment catching aflame and chaos ensuing can be heard. It’s bound to be an exciting continuation, based on this alone. \n\n\nIt’s not exactly news that Arcane is getting a second season. Shortly after the first season concluded on November 20, 2021, the powers that be at Riot Games made the announcement that a second season was “in production.” It’s not even news that the series would be returning at the end of 2024, thanks to an investor presentation given by Tencent in September 2023, which revealed it’d be coming during Q4.\n\n\nBut, we now know for certain that Arcane will be returning in November 2024. I am not at all sure why we’re being told now, with a year left to wait for more of the League of Legends story, but some of the recent strikes in Hollywood that may have put a pause on production. \n\n\nI suppose we’ve already waited two years, what’s one more? In the meantime, I’ll just be over here, with “Enemy” by Imagine Dragons and JID playing on perpetual repeat. \n\nThe post Netflix confirms Arcane Season 2 will arrive in November 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "An unknown number of employees have been laid off at Warframe developer and Wayfinder publisher Digital Extremes today. According to Polgyon, at least 20 employees in total were let go. It appears Digital Extremes is closing their external projects division which publishes games like the recently Early Access release title Wayfinder. Instead, the company will shift its focus towards internal projects like Warframe and Soulframe. \n\n\nWe reached out to Digital Extremes who confirmed the information and provided the following statement\n\n\n\n“We can confirm we have made the difficult decision to cease operations of our external projects division. We have had to say goodbye to a number of hardworking and highly valuable team members as a result.”\n\n\n\n\nThe representative also confirmed that Digital Extremes is looking to transfer Wayfinder in its entirety into the hands of the developer, Airship Syndicate.\n\n\n\n\"“We're working with Airship to transition full control of Wayfinder to them in coming months.\"\n\n\n\n\nJust a few weeks ago there was a leadership change at Digital Extremes as well, with Chief Creative Officer Steven Sinclair replacing Founder James Schmalz as CEO of the company.\n\n\nRough times in the video games industry\n\n\nThese kinds of articles are never easy to write, especially when the video game industry seems to be suffering layoffs several times a week. Just yesterday Embracer Group laid off staff at developer Free Radical, after doing the same just last month at Cryptic Studios and Zen Studios. Ubisoft Montreal also suffered layoffs earlier this week.\n\n\nThis list has grown so big it almost feels easier to name the companies that have not conducted layoffs compared to those that have. According to the website VideoGameLayoffs.com, over 6,500 employees from over 100 companies in the games industry have been laid off this year alone.\n\n\n\n\nThe post Digital Extremes cuts jobs, closes external projects division appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "With Kratos' vicious past, you wouldn't expect a God of War Ragnarok Lo-Fi video to surface. However, PlayStation and a few musicians, including Alex Moukala, have released such a thing, and it's relaxing AF.\n\n\n\n\nChilling out with Atreus\n\n\nAtreus, in this video published Thursday, takes the place of the kid studying. As the chill music is playing, he's writing in his journal. The Lo-Fi beats in the background are from popular musician and composer Alex Moukala and Pokari.\n\n\n\"Earlier this year, Sony asked me to create some God of War: Ragnarok Lo-Fi remixes for them,\" Moukala on social media. \"As a massive Bear McCreary fan I was overjoyed and simply couldn't say no!\" The composer later said \"the whole process made [him] appreciate God of War's soundtrack even more than [he] already did.\"\n\n\nThe three McCreary songs both Moukala and Polari remixed are: \"Huldra Brothers,\" \"Memories of Mother,\" and the God of War Ragnarök theme. They sound fantastic and are currently powering me through this news story. The animation is also expressive and slightly changes over the span of the 32-minute video. It was drawn and animated by Spud Gun Studios.\n\n\nMoukala has been busy over the past few years. He's behind the soundtrack for the fan-based Final Fantasy IX: Memoria Project and interviewed the Yakuza game composers on his YouTube channel. In the past, he's also turned the macabre Bloodborne music into a dazzling Mario Kart track.\n\n\n\n\nGod of War: Ragnarok celebrates its one-year anniversary this week. When it was first released, it received critical praise across the board. \n\n\n\"God of War Ragnarok is a fantastic showcase of what this series has to offer, and a sterling example of how it still has life left in it,\" said our review. \"While not everything lands with the sequel from a story perspective, the core of the original is preserved, with some new twists and turns still to go.\"\n\nThe post Official God of War Ragnarok Lo-Fi video lets us relax between slaying gods appeared first on Destructoid.",

This open-world action game unfolds in a new section of James Cameron’s wildly successful Avatar universe, and this new chapter in the mythos graces Game Informer’s cover this month. \nAvatar: Frontiers of Pandora – Exclusive Coverage Trailer\n\n\nWe visited Massive’s studio in Malmö, Sweden, to play a couple of hours of the game set in the Kinglor Forest, one of Frontier’s three regions. Our 12-page story also includes an exclusive breakdown of the game’s other two regions, the Upper Plains and the Clouded Forest, which we got to tour during our visit.

Resident Evil Village hit the App Store just last week, and today, Capcom has let us know when Resident Evil 4 Remake is coming to the platform: December 20. You can see some screenshots from the Apple port below. \n\nThe game won't be available to all iPhone owners, however. Resident Evil 4 Remake will only be available on the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, meaning you'll have to grab the newest product in order to play this game on the go. That said, it will also be available on iPads and Macs with the M1 chip or later. If you're a diehard Apple fan and have multiple RE4 Remake compatible products, you'll be happy to know that the game also supports cross-progression between Apple devices, so you can start a save file on your Mac at home and pick it up on your phone when you're on the go.\nThe game is available for pre-order on the App Store now, but players will be able to start the game for free before committing to a full purchase. Its recently released DLC, Separate Ways, will launch alongside it as well. While we haven't been able to go hands-on with this version of the game quite yet, we like Resident Evil 4 Remake quite a lot: you can read our review for it right here.",

That means users will no longer be able to directly upload screenshots and video clips from the console to the social media site.\nAn announcement update posted to the PlayStation Support page states that on Monday, November 13, X integration will end, which includes the ability to “view any content published on X on PS5/PS4, and the ability to post and view content, trophies, and other gameplay-related activities on X directly from PS5/PS4 (or link an X account to do so).”\nWhile a bummer for those who make frequent use of this feature, which offers a simple method of posting gameplay content to the platform, there are a couple of more involved alternatives depending on your platform. If you’re a PS5 user, you can still use the PlayStation mobile app to upload gameplay captures to then post on X. You can read how to do that here. PS4 users have to rely on ShareFactory and do a bit more work, and you can read those steps here.\nMicrosoft made the same move in April by disabling sharing to X directly from the console and instructing players to instead use the Xbox app on mobile (with some speculating the decision was made to avoid paying the platform's then-new monthly application programming interface (API) fee). This now means that the Switch will become the sole console that supports direct media sharing to X. \nWhat do you think about the decision to end X integration? Did you use this feature regularly?

Humanity's story reflects real-world events, showing us the paths we're currently on.\nWatch The Documentary:\n\n\n\"Soon after we began making Humanity, a number of big events and movements broke out around the world,\" Enhance founder and CEO Tetsuya Mizuguchi tells us. \"There were human rights movements, the Hong Kong protests, [and] then there was the pandemic. And war soon followed in Ukraine. We had no idea how quickly and deeply AI would infiltrate our society either. I think all these things found their way into the core of Humanity. That question, for example, 'What is humanity? What is human nature?' We would often talk about how people, looked at individually, are good. There are so many wonderful people out there. But when they become a group, or a nation, or even just big groups, at that level, something happens. It's like a different switch gets flipped. And what you see there, that is what we're trying to depict in Humanity.\"\nWatch above or over on Game Informer's YouTube channel to see the full documentary about the making of Humanity. \"Violence Is Inevitable\" speaks to the core creative team, including Mizuguchi and tha creative director Yugo Nakamura, about the project's origins, its complications and lengthy development cycle, and how it came to show us the nature of humanity.",

          "description": "Earlier this year, HBO's The Last of Us successfully brought developer Naughty Dog's critically acclaimed and fan-favorite PlayStation exclusive to life on the TV screen. Its Season 1 premiere was HBO's second-largest debut since 2010, and its second episode broke records, too. Roughly three weeks after the premiere of the series, HBO revealed The Last of Us would be getting a second season. And now, thanks to a new Deadline report, we know it will start shooting next year and premiere sometime in 2025. \nDeadline learned this at a New York news event, where HBO boss Casey Bloys reportedly told press that Season 2 will head into production early next year, aiming for a 2025 premiere. Unfortunately, that's all Bloys said about the season. But, as noted by Deadline, series co-creator and executive producer Craig Mazin revealed earlier this summer pre-strike that the team was already able to get some work done, adding that the first episode was already written. \n\n\n\"We got pretty far actually, we were doing great,\" Mazin told Deadline. \"[The Last of Us game co-creator Neil Druckmann] and I had been sitting and talking with [The Last of Us Part II co-writer Halley Gross] and Bo Shim, the new writer that was in our little tiny room with us – obviously not a mini room because we're greenlit proper, we're a real show, and because I hate that mini room stuff.\"\nConsidering the first season of The Last of Us covered the events of the first Last of Us game, including its Left Behind DLC, it's clear Season 2 of the show will dive into The Last of Us Part II. We're all still awaiting some casting announcements, like who will play Abby and Lev, but that likely won't happen until the actor and writer strikes are over. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's The Last of Us Part 1 review and then read our review of The Last of Us Part II. \n[Source: Deadline]\nHow far into The Last of Us Part II do you think Season 2 will go?

Sometimes Yoshi showed up in The Legend of Zelda, and Kirby was whatever color he felt like at the moment, be it gray or pink. In 1996, that laissez-faire attitude was in full effect for the release of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars for the Super Nintendo. Link, Samus, and even Donkey Kong (sort of) all had inexplicable cameos in the game, and one of my big questions about the remake was whether or not those would move forward. If you're ready to learn the answer for at least some of them, read on!\nImpressively, the answer is yes! At least for Link and Donkey Kong. I have not been able to play to the point in the game where Samus appears, so I can't answer that question yet. When you get close to Link after seeing him in the sleeping bed, a \"talk\" option appears, and when you click it, a Zelda musical sting plays.\nDonkey Kong's cameo has always been questionable as to whether or not it is him, as he is just labeled \"Guerilla\", but he sure looks a lot like Donkey Kong, just with a crown.\n\nThe Super Mario RPG remake releases November 17 for Nintendo Switch.\nPurchase",

Ahead of his debut, NetherRealm Studios has released the official Omni-Man gameplay trailer and alongside hard-hitting (and gory) super moves, it features a brutal and show-accurate fatality for the character. \nThe trailer teases Liu Kang for allowing a Viltrumite into the Realms of Mortal Kombat before more than two minutes of Omni-Man action plays out. And closing out the trailer is the fatality for the upcoming Kombat Pack character. We won't spoil it here, so check it out in the Mortal Kombat 1 Omni-Man gameplay trailer below: \n\n\nOmni-Man hits Mortal Kombat 1 as part of the first Kombat Pack on November 9. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Mortal Kombat 1 review and then check out Mortal Kombat creator Ed Boon on Hot Ones. \nAre you excited for Omni-Man in Mortal Kombat 1?

          "description": "Back in August, a Pokémon Presents revealed that the first part of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet's DLC, collectively known as The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero, would hit the game in September. That has since come and gone, with players eagerly awaiting the second part of this expansion. And now, the official Pokémon Twitter account has revealed The Indigo Disk DLC goes live next month. \n\n\nMore specifically, The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero Part 2: The Indigo Disk hits Pokémon Scarlet and Violet on December 14. As those keeping up with Game Freak's ninth generation of Pokémon know, The Indigo Disk brings players to Blueberry Academy, which is actually in the Unova region, rather than the Paldea region where Pokémon Scarlet and Violet take place. The Unova region is the setting for Pokémon Black and White, and their sequels, Pokémon Black 2 and White 2. \nPokémon Scarlet or Pokémon Violet The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero Part 2: The Indigo Disk launches on December 14!\n#PokemonScarletViolet ❤️💜 pic.twitter.com/IljDHdTUeq\nNovember 2, 2023\nMany players are speculating that The Indigo Disk will, in some way, tease remakes of the fifth generation of Pokémon, as those are next in line for Game Freak's cadence of remaking previously released Pokémon games. With players leaving Paldea to check out an academy in Unova, many predict some hint at potential Pokémon Black and White remakes await trainers. But only time will tell. \nPokémon Scarlet and Violet: The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero Part 2 – The Indigo Disk hits the games on December 14. The DLC can be purchased as a pack for $34.99. \nFor more, read about how after The Indigo Disk is out, every starter Pokémon will be available in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, and then read Game Informer's Pokémon Scarlet and Violet review. \nAre you hopping into The Indigo Disk next month?

          "description": "Put your sleuthing caps on, detectives—it’s time to solve some mysteries! We are proud to announce that a whole batch of HeR Interactive’s Nancy Drew games are now ready for public testing:\nIn Nancy Drew: Stay Tuned for Danger, a soap opera star needs your help in uncovering who is behind a series of death threats that sound a little too real for comfort. \nNancy Drew: Message in a Haunted Mansion has you helping out with repairs in a Victorian mansion. However, a series of strange accidents, plus some murmurings of a ghost haunting, quickly threaten to turn this renovation into an investigation.\nIn Nancy Drew: Treasure in the Royal Tower a failed ski vacation at an eccentric castle with even more eccentric inhabitants soon turns into a quest to uncover a lost piece of the history of the French Revolution.\nAnd if you’re looking for something more thrilling, in Nancy Drew: The Final Scene, you will find yourself racing against the clock to find your kidnapped friend, while also saving a historical theater with more than a fair share of secrets from demolition.\nThe games are available for purchase through HeR Interactive’s website or Steam (Stay Tuned for Danger is not available on Steam, however). Or if you already own a CD copy of the games, their English and Russian variants will also work. To play them with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, if you encounter any issues, please submit a bug report to our issue tracker.\n>",

          "description": "We are very pleased to announce today the start of the testing period of two single-game engines: Kingdom: The Far Reaches and Escape From Hell!\nKingdom, was developed and released by Interplay in 1995. Only the DOS version of the game (available on gog.com) is supported. It's a cartoon FMV game, with an inventory, in which you have to guide Lathan Kandor through a medieval world, discovering the magic spells and the items required to defeat an evil wizard. \nEscape From Hell, was developed for Electronic Arts by the game veterans Richard Seaborne and Alan Murphy and was released in 1990. You play Alan in this keyboard-only Role Playing Game and visit Hell, looking for your girlfriend who was accidentally teleported there.\nBoth games use heavily hardcoded logic which is error prone and requires a lot of testing, so we need your feedback more than ever as they are both incompletely tested. There is sadly only one known demo for Kingdom. Support for the Windows and Mac versions of Kingdom may come later! Please contact us if you have some other demos of both games.\nTo play any of these games, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker and please take some screenshots along the way!\n>",
