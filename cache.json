Instead of growing fruits of vegetables, you grow crops of monsters. And all of this is given form by Fairy Tail and Edens Zero creator Hiro Mashima's distinctive artwork.\nIn this new RPG, we follow Ten and his friends who are all Farmagia — magical tamers (or farming mages) that can control and fight with monsters. Finding themselves in the middle of a war, Ten and his friends use the power of monsters – and friendship – to prevail over all obstacles.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Ironically, no trading allowed.\nDigital card games like Marvel Snap have seen a lot of success in recent years with short, satisfying matches that you can finish in a few minutes. The mobile release of Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket almost seems like a direct answer to this trend. From uncomplicated card text to simplified rules, it axes much of the complexity of the original Pokémon TCG while still wrapping it up in an addictive collection loop that looks to have players checking their phones daily and maybe even spending real-world money on microtransactions to get more cards.\nAfter spending a little too much time opening booster packs and battling friends and randoms, we can say TCG Pocket is as predatory as a Pidgeot stalking a Caterpie and more mesmerising than a Swoobat using Attract. On the collection side of things, at least.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "You're joking... ANOTHER one?\nThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time's inclusion in Nintendo Music was a given, but we were curious which version of the iconic Fire Temple theme would make the cut. Would it be the original, which Nintendo swiftly replaced after discovering that a religious chant was sampled in its mix? Or would it be its chant-less replacement, which was ushered in on 1.2 cartridges alongside Ganondorf's newly greened blood? Well, it's neither.\nThe Fire Temple theme listed in the app's OOT library is only 41 seconds long, providing the percussion-heavy opening and two rounds of the twinkly motif before fading out. Things wrap up right around where the chanting would normally begin, and there's no option to extend the track, either.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It all rides on who you speak to. The humans believe one thing about the origins and workings of Thedas, the elves another, the qunari something else entirely. These differences are the basis for many factional disagreements and thus, many core series plot developments. According to former lead writer David Gaider, however, there's an \"uber-plot\" behind it all that may one day be resolved and bring the series to a close, assuming BioWare continue to refer to his original (and closely guarded) narrative documents.\r\n \nRead more",

I think it was a decision that just came down to, 'We need to cut something.' Was it to please the investors, the stock market? They're playing a different game.\nRead more",

          "description": "One of my favourite satires is the Screwtape Letters, an epistolary novel by Narnia scribe C.S. Lewis. It consists of messages from an oily elder demon to his nephew about how to correctly groom the soul of an unsuspecting human being. It's a claustrophobic send-up of managerial politics and nepotism, with World War 1 unfolding in the background. A real pick-me-up. Sintopia is the Two Point incarnation of that premise - in other words, brighter and breezier and definitely more slapstick than Christian. It puts you in charge of a world divided between Earth and hell, and challenges you to ensure a steady movement of optimally sinful souls between one and the other. Say your prayers and watch the trailer.\n Read more",

In the prologue, reformed outlaw John Marston confronts an old bandit acquaintance and gets himself roundly shot to bits.

Let's play Devil's Advocate and try to Lionel Hutz that quote: \"Nazis? I hate these guys!\" [pointing at some Communists]. Yeah, I'm not really feeling it.\nI guess Indiana did sleep with a Nazi once, but only by accident, and yes he did once cosplay as an SS officer and get Hitler's autograph, but again, only by accident. Aww, he's such a ditz! I think his political stance is abundantly obvious in Indiana Jones And The Great Circle - the new Wolfenslike from MachineGames, in which you will blast and bludgeon literally hundreds of Shitlerites in unambiguously one-sided first-person view. So it's amusing, if not wholly unexpected, that MachineGames and Bethesda have slapped the game with an explicit disclaimer stating that the game's depictions of Nazis are not, in fact, Nazi propaganda.\n Read more",

          "description": "What Remains Of Edith Finch is a very upsetting collection of interactive short stories about the brief, tragic lives of a cursed family who live in a monstrous treehouse. It's also a wonderful show of experimentation, switching genres from story to story - one minute you're a playable bestiary on shuffle, the next you're beheading fish in a cannery as the worktable disappears beneath your scrolling daydreams. The developer's next project seems to be pursuing a similar balance of whimsy and darkness. It's another anthology experience, which casts you as a field biologist studying \"the strangeness of organic life\". Also, chicken-legged houses.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I've been deeply moved by individual scenes in this sequel. By the end I was sorry to leave its characters behind. At the same time (please now imagine my face is splitting into a second, colour-washed expression with wobbly VFX) I am relieved it's over, so I don't have to deal with the inconsistent behaviour of those characters, the flimsy plot, and a convoluted approach to murder mystery. \nRead more",

          "description": "In case you don't know the headline reference, Orpheus was a mythical Greek musician who famously descended to the underworld to rescue his snake-bitten lover, Eurydice. The underworld's rulers, Hades and Persephone, were massively bummed out by Orpheus's emo lyre-playing, and swiftly agreed to let him lead Eurydice's soul upward to the waking world, with the extremely simple proviso that he not look back at her till they're both on the surface.\nBeing a love-drunk spannerhead, however, Orpheus couldn't resist a quick peek at Eurydice after crossing the threshold - and the result is a timeless moral about human frailty and the specific truism that you should absolutely never date musicians, which Australian developers Oppolyon Studios appear to have totally ignored in their otherwise-redolent game about kicking your brother's soul out of hell.\n Read more",

You won't have much time to write in Static Dread, sadly. The world has ended, the oceans teem with squirmy, extra-dimensional lifeforms, and it's your job as the apparent sole surviving lighthouse keeper to distinguish vessels loaded with eldritch horrors from vessels loaded with people who need saving from eldritch horrors. \nGoing by the teaser trailer, below, this appears to be comparable to playing border guard in Papers, Please, but it's less political and more tentacular. You field queries over the radio, run your finger down a clipboard, and decide whether to kindle the lamps or beg the coastguard to blast that ship back to hell. There's a dialogue line in the trailer which I, personally, would consider highly untrustworthy. \"It's consuming my team!\" screams a self-described ship captain. \"Please, send help! Gosh...\" Look, \"friend\", no genuine human being says \"gosh\" in an emergency situation. Not even British human beings say \"gosh\" in an emergency situation.

Here, she will contend with things like people crawling on the ceiling and coming over all Babadook. Maya does have one major advantage: the ability to reverse gravity. Watch her put that ability to use in the new trailer.\n Read more",

It's a third-person action adventure where two famous video game folks joined forces: No More Heroes' Suda51 and Resident Evil's Shinji Mikami. And to my knowledge, it's considered a bit of a cult classic.\nSo, having played Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered after never experiencing the original, do I think it's any good? If you were a fan of the OG, there's no doubt you'll like it. If you're coming in as a newbie, I think it's refreshing in the sense it's a trim throwback with some interesting ideas and middling-to-good execution.

Graphics driver improvements! Third-party SSDs working better! More balanced display colours! No more \"spurious power LED blinking\"! Brilliant, I hate spurious power LED blinking. The original LCD Deck also now gets the Steam Deck OLED’s overclocking controls in the BIOS, which you’re welcome to try if you’re braver than I am about cranking up the temperatures of a already squished-in handheld chip.\nRead more",

We’ll talk about that in a moment, but first, I must draw your attention to this magical map. I’m very excited about it.

This puzzle-solving sequel, Wilmot Works It Out, doesn't come packaged with its predecessor's wry humour, nor the same sense of compulsion. Instead, it exudes a calm and homely sense of idle comfort. For me, that ultimately makes it less compelling, even if it is thematically the entire point. This is about a warehouse worker doing jigsaws on his day off.\nRead more",

In case you're unfamiliar, Denuvo's wares have become infamous for allegedly sabotaging the performance of all sorts of video games, from Resident Evil: Village to Tekken 7, though accounts of the severity vary, and there is an on-going shortage of independently supplied raw data. \nDenuvo's attempts to clear the air include opening a Discord, which they say “ is a key step in fostering closer relationships with game developers, publishers, and players, offering a dynamic, real-time platform for meaningful interaction”. On Monday, Denuvo’s media team reached out to me to offer an interview with Denuvo’s product manager, Andreas Ullmann. Here’s that interview, edited for brevity. \nRPS: In a recent public statement you said “we will stop letting every claim about our product go unanswered\". What claims are you referring to?\nAndreas Ullmann: It's basically really about the stuff that's posted by the community. So you just need to check out Steam forums, for example. Very toxic, very hostile environment. If a game announces to use any of our products, if you check out the Steam forums, all the claims are popping in. SSDs are destroyed by our solution. The usual performance topics, and we simply don't want to leave the floor to these people who are posting all things about us anymore. We want to also be there for a person who has not heard about us before. We also want to share our view, our opinion on these topics, and also act as a trusted source of information.\nRead more",

At least, I think he's an odd flag-bearer for a series of games where you live out a nostalgic, Japanese summer in the countryside.\nAnd I think it's doubly weird that Shin chan: Shiro And The Coal Town opts for a collectathon approach, that doesn't necessarily make the act of living out a Cicada Summer all that mesmerising.

It's one of your 'cursed video game' videogames in the spirit of Inscryption and Pony Island, and based on a quick blast with the demo, it seems lush.\nIt's set in the 1980s, a premise I now automatically find horrible because I was born in the 1980s and that was, like, a million years ago. You're a kid who's playing a legendary 8-bit game that's said to be possessed by evil spirits. The experience sees you alternating between the surprisingly labyrinthine space of the game, and the increasingly threatening environment of your bedroom, where terrible toys abound. Did you have one of those phones on wheels with eyes as a kid? Whoever invented that deserves a spell in Arkham Asylum.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Not many people hit the refund button on Sonar Shock, the indie immersive sim that’s rated Very Positive on Steam. But those that do tend to complain they couldn’t get the hang of the controls. You can understand why. Try to strafe left to dodge an attack from a blubber monster, and you’ll instead rotate on the spot. Attempt to turn the camera with a flick of the mouse, and you’ll discover that your view remains fixed in place - the cursor moving across the screen as if searching for an icon on your desktop.\n\"The controls are actually one of the biggest points that make people bounce off the game,\" developer Raphael Bossniak admits.\nAnd yet they’re also a unique selling point. Where last year’s extraordinary System Shock remake embraced the interface and keyboard conventions of modern gaming, Sonar Shock leans into the experimentation of pre-Quake control schemes - long before WASD and mouselook became standardised for the sake of ease and sanity.\nRead more",

A post on the game's Steam page yesterday reads: \"{n} purple wardens beseech the Chair, What is death, if one rose is fair? How long from beetle moon to beetle moon?\" That means absolutely nothing to me. But at least one fan in the comments knows their lore enough to have translated it, resulting in a specific date later this year. If their solution is correct, this could be a characteristically cryptic way for developer Freehold Games to announce the date for the roguelike's 1.0 release.

Some say that Factorio gave that genre life, though I'd point at Dwarf Fortress as one among many notable forebears. Today, the terrain of factory simming is hotly contested by rival piles of conveyor belt spaghetti. I'm not just talking about Satisfactory or Shapez - they're even making philosophical factory sims these days. They have cosy factory sims now.\nAccordingly, the immense, smoke-rimmed cyborg eye of Factorio has turned from the exhausted soil to the relatively untapped heavens. Somewhere up there, there is unspoilt territory. Somewhere, there is land that has never known the roar of a smelter - and in Factorio's behemothic Space Age DLC, out today, you will find it.\n Read more",

It elicits adrenaline almost as much as it forces murder economics down your piehole. This is the kind of game that puts you into a blistering, exciting (and confusing) battle for survival, then displays a graph when you lose. I need to get as far away from it as possible.\nRead more",

Now, imagine a faint scuttling behind the skirting boards. A rattling in the pipes. Was there a toilet in Gone Home's autumnal mansion? I can't recall, but you should probably steer clear.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Konference OpenAlt 2024 proběhne již tento víkend 2. a 3. listopadu v prostorách FIT VUT v Brně. Začíná ale už v pátek na warm-up party ve Studentském klubu u Kachničky v 17:00. Pokud jste ještě areál FITu nenavštívili, k dispozici jsou pokyny k orientaci. \r\n\r\nNa programu je 54 přednášek a workshopů. Témata jsou od silně technických témat jako je třeba GCC nebo PostgreSQL po méně technické témata jako eGovernment, nebo třeba detailní analýzu problémů s Digitálním Stavebním Řízením. Vypíchnout lze přednášky linuxových distribucích Fedora Silverblue (Nerozbitný linux pro celou rodinu), openSUSE Leap, nebo Turris. Nesmí chybět témata jako kontejnery (Kubernetes) nebo umělá inteligence (velké jazykové modely). Už tradičně si můžete zkusit nakreslit mapu OpenStreetMap se zkušenými lektory od Missing Maps. Pro bastlíře je nachystaná například přednáška o chytré domácnosti Majordomus nebo o Linuxu v ledničce. S cílem přitáhnout mladší generaci představujeme studentskou sekci, kde jsou jednotlivé projekty dílem studentů (například v rámci jejich maturitních prací). Bude řeč i o výuce programování na základní škole, nebo výuce fyziky pomocí arduina \"Physibox\".\r\n\r\nMimo hlavní program bude na chodbách spoustu stánků různých projektů jako je Fedora, openSUSE, Grafana. Stánek budou mít i radio amatéři a 3D tiskaři. Pro děti bude v sobotu nachystaný dětský koutek, kde si děti budou moci vyzkoušet různé hračky pro výuku programování. V neděli se dětský koutek promění v PlayZone od OMG Robotics. Sobotní odpoledne tradičně zakončíme posezením u lahodného moku ve studentském klubu u Kachničky.\r\n\r\nBudeme rádi, když myšlenky naší konference budete šířit a pozvete své kolegy a kamarády. Jak jistě víte, tak konference je primárně v češtině a vstup je zdarma.\r\n\r\nPokud máte nějaké otázky, tak se zkuste podívat do FAQ nebo se zeptejte na Matrixu, Telegramu nebo emailem.",

That's interesting for looking at the new 5th Gen AMD EPYC top-end wares but in comparing to 4th Gen EPYC also means higher core counts at the top-end. In being curious about the core-for-core advantages of 5th Gen EPYC, I managed to get my hands on the AMD EPYC 9655 processors for seeing how that model compares to the prior AMD EPYC 9654 \"Genoa\" flagship model.

All you have to do is progress to a certain part in the story to claim your pre-order bonuses in Dragon Age The Veilguard.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nWhere to access your Dragon Age The Veilguard pre-order bonuses\n\n\nYou can access your pre-order bonuses in Dragon Age: The Veilguard after completing the introduction prologue and gaining access to the Veilguard base of operations which is the Lighthouse. Without spoiling anything, the prologue is considered complete after your encounter with the Dragon Age The Veilguard antagonist Solas.\n\n\nOnce you've reached this part in Dragon Age The Veilguard you'll unlock your headquarters which is the Lighthouse. Between quests you'll come back to the Lighthouse, so it's a location you'll quickly get familiarized with.\n\n\nIn the Lighthouse, look for a chest in the corner of the Infirmary Room which is located in the southwestern room of the area on the Lighthouse map. The chest is named a Wardrobe and will be accessible throughout all of Dragon Age The Veilguard and servers as a spot to change and customize your cosmetic appearance including those you've earned via pre-order bonuses. No matter which edition or platform you chose for Dragon Age The Veilguard, your pre-order rewards are accessible at the Wardrobe in the Lighthouse for the entirety of the game.\n\n\nIf you activate a code that unlocks more cosmetic rewards or pre-order bonuses, you will get a notification when you next play Dragon Age The Veilguard that indicates that the rewards are now available at the Wardrobe in the Lighthouse. Simply return to the chest in the Infirmary Room and interact with it to access any new rewards you have unlocked.\n\nThe post How to claim pre-order bonuses in Dragon Age The Veilguard appeared first on Destructoid.",

To best avoid getting banned or blacklisted by any means, just stick to the game downloaded by the program and don’t follow any external links for free stuff.\n\n\nWhat platforms is Pokemon TCGP currently on?\n\n\nPokémon TCG Pocket is currently on Android and iOS. \n\n\nYou will need Android 7.0 and up to play this game on your game if you are using an Android-based device.

          "description": "If you want to complete your quests in Dragon Age: The Veilguard without any hassle, you'll have to know all about your enemies' weakpoints to do maximum damage.\n\n\nWith plenty of time between the upcoming Dragon Age game and the older titles, there are some obvious changes under the hood. In combat, paying attention to your enemies' weakpoints will allow you to erode their health pool faster. It's also pretty easy to hit the soft spots of your foes once you know where to hit, and there's a proper indicator available as well.\n\n\nAll weakpoints in Dragon Age: The Veilguard\n\n\nIt goes without saying that weakpoints will vary based on your enemies. One of the best things to do is to go for the head. Much like your critical shots in Call of Duty Black Ops 6, going for the head will likely do the job for most enemies. You'll be surprised how common it is.\n\n\nOnce you hit the weakpoint of an enemy, the damage text will show up in purple. That's the indicator that you have hit the correct spot. However, a few enemies have some unexpected areas to target.\n\n\n\nArchdemon Razikale: Chin/Forehead/Neck\n\n\nBlood. Forge Prime: Open Mouth Furnace\n\n\nGreater Sentiner: Orb in the torso region\n\n\nGreater Hurlock Blighter: Orange pustule\n\n\nHigh Dragons: Glowing legs/underbelly (if you manage to stagger it)\n\n\n\nImage via Bioware\n\n\nHow to get more weakpoint damage in Dragon Age: The Veilguard\n\n\nThe core process is simple in this case as well - just use a better weapon. But in the long run, you'll want to focus on your class and their areas of specialization. For example, Warriors will do more damage to Staggered enemies, while Mages do a lot of elemental damage. Hence, you'll want to boost all skills that empower your core abilities.\n\n\nThis is the best way to amplify the damage you cause by hitting an enemy's weakpoints. There are, however, no abilities to my knowledge that strictly target the soft spots of an enemy.\n\nThe post Dragon Age: The Veilguard – How do Weakpoints work? appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s the crossover that makes the most sense, but it’s because it makes the most sense that I believed it wouldn’t happen. Time makes fools of us all.\n\n\nOde to Castlevania is funny because Vampire Survivors is already an ode to Castlevania. Nowhere is this more evident than with the new weapons that don’t have a lot to do with Castlevania. That’s because all the weapons most associated with the game were already in it originally, from throwing crosses to holy water.\n\n\nBut I’m getting ahead of myself. By default, a Castlevania crossover is going to be the best expansion for the game because I love Castlevania. However, it’s also the best expansion so far for other reasons.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoi…",

          "description": "We are excited to announce that Rise of the Dragon  is now ready for public testing. This is the first of a small number of games built using the DGDS (Dynamix Game Development System) engine.\nThe Dynamix name may be familiar – bought by Sierra in 1990, the Dynamix brand continued and became well known for action and puzzle games like The Incredible Machine, A10 Tank Killer, and Red Baron.  They also made a few adventures using the custom DGDS engine.\nRise of the Dragon is set in Los Angeles in a dark version of the future, circa 2053.  You play as Blade Hunter, a private investigator and retired police officer.  After a designer drug kills the mayor's rebellious daughter, Chandra, Hunter is hired to find the people responsible for releasing the drug on the streets. What Blade ultimately finds is much more than he expected.  Rise of the Dragon combines classic point-and-click adventure style with platforming arcade sequences, giving a unique gameplay combination.\nYou’ll need the latest daily build of ScummVM and files from the DOS version of the game, which you can buy at GOG (check our wiki for the required data files).  Please file any issues you notice on our bug tracker.\n>",
