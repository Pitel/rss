          "description": "I'm in a weird place with the Meta Quest. It's really its own platform these days, with its own specs and increasingly divergent library of games. At the same time, the Meta's standalone headsets are by far the most popular PCVR devices. Therefore, most PCVR gamers will also have access to the Quest's handful of VR exclusives. Generally, this column sticks to covering games you can play with any PCVR headset, Quest or no. But since I reviewed the Meta Quest 3 last month, it feels odd not to check out at least one of its new titles, especially when it's probably the most notable VR release of the year – Assassin's Creed Nexus.\nAlso, I'll admit, a VR Assassin's Creed game intrigues me. The idea of cavorting across historical rooftops and shanking templars in the sternum sounds brilliant. It also sounds like barf city. Most VR games limit the need to move around as much as possible, so translating a game as kinetic as Assassin's Creed into VR seems mighty challenging.\nRead more",

No matter how many blankets I pile on top of my knees, it hangs there lurking, breathing down my neck, extending its icy mitts down my fingers until they're too frosty to carry on typing. I sometimes worry the cold will penetrate my very soul, a harbinger of something more sinister and oppressive. Oh wait. False alarm. It's just the cat giving me the evils out the corner of my eye because I've stolen their favourite woolen nap pillow. Nothing to worry about. Anyway! What are you playing this weekend?

Very late: the evergreen free-to-play dark fantasy action-RPG launched literal generations ago in 2013, the heyday of Bioshock Infinite and GTA 5. (It's still arguably the heyday of GTA 5. Bioshock Infinite, not so much.) It's my understanding that New Zealand-based developer Grinding Gears have released approximately one bazillion Path of Exile updates and expansions in the decade since, the latest of which, Affliction, is briefly detailed in a boxout down the page. \r\n\n\r\nI am not your guy for blow-by-blow descriptions of what Affliction adds to Path of Exile. My cautious summary would be: lots of terrifying trees, and lots of modifiers. I am, however, your guy for a newcomer's snapshot verdict on the sequel ahead of the closed Path of Exile 2 beta on 7th June 2024. In a twist so far-fetched they might just pull it off, the new game is designed both for returning players and newcomers, and I think a lot of that is epitomised by the just-announced Mercenary class, which reflects game director Jonathan Rogers's desire to create combat mechanics that are at once more involved and more inviting.\r\n\n \nRead more",

One of them was Spine, an upcoming action game that asks the question: what if Sifu also had guns? The new gameplay trailer shows street artist heroine Redline punching, kicking and shooting her way through a cyberpunk-themed world of thugs and armoured guards, and her fancy footwork and the equally agile camera framing looks like it could be quite the combo when it eventually comes out in 2025. Alas, the trailer doesn't give away much else, but I spoke to developers Nekki ahead of tonight's showcase to find more about it, and how it's taking direct inspiration from Sifu and John Wick to become the next big cinematic beat 'em up.\nRead more",

We laugh about this (but also discuss the role of Steam reviews and devs replying to them). As well as that, the lads have been playing, well, the same sort of stuff this week, James brings us talk of mini PCs, and Nate makes us play Dracula or Russell Crowe. Extremely normal.\nRead more",

In the case of my multiplayer hands-on, that empire was the Ix'Idar, a race of burrowing insect critters with a unique resource - pheromones. Boldly disregarding the PR's gentle advice that I start with an easier-to-master race, I set out to swarm the galaxy and immediately found myself at the bottom of the victory or \"Succession\" point scoreboard, with one player picking off my planets by means of espionage, while others stomped my fleets of stargrubs flat in no-nonsense space combat. \r\n\n\r\nI did manage to briefly take possession of the titular Nexus, a throneworld which awards beaucoup Succession points to its owner, but it turns out fixating on the Nexus is a great way to set yourself up for a midgame dogpile - you pour resources into capturing it, sacrifice half your fleet to the first invader, then lose it all to the second. With my initially bountiful dominions rudely shrunk to a smattering of isolated planets, I took the coward's way out of the press event and said I had to be going because I had other work to attend to. I didn't at all! I just wanted to go and cry in the toilet. Alas for the Ix'Idar - not so much \"lions led by donkeys\" as an antfarm in the hands of a wilful toddler.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only... compromise, calculation and license to misbehave. In Owlcat's forthcoming RPG Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, you play the free-wheeling head of an interstellar merchant's dynasty. Operating on the fringes of uncharted space, you're the owner of a Warrant of Trade that essentially lets you run your own miniature empire within the Imperium, deciding the fates of planets, amassing vast wealth and recruiting a motley crew of xenos, heretics and assorted weirdos. It's the kind of behaviour that'd get you vaporised if you were some run-of-the-mill Space Marine Chaplain, but out here on the frontier, you're allowed to act with impunity, providing you fulfil your overall mandate of adding to the God Emperor's glory and kicking the odd Eldar's head in.\r\n\n\r\nRogue Traders are arguably the only characters in Games Workshop's brutal and decrepit table-top setting that lend themselves to the role of CRPG protagonist, because they are the only characters in Warhammer 40K's Imperium who enjoy anything like the plot agency of a Commander Shepard. And with that, I think, comes an interesting transformation of the character alignment systems the game shares with other CRPGs such as Baldur's Gate 3.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The new Pale Reach DLC gets even weirder, a masterpiece of show-don’t-tell horror that manages to evoke some of the more inspired Bloodborne monsters as well as some of icy, supernatural scares from The Terror. And it's all centred on a big whale. \r\n\n\r\nSpoilers ahead, friends, but in The Pale Reach, a massive icy landscape has suddenly appeared in the southern, well, reaches of Dredge's world, so naturally we’re off to see what that’s all about, ploughing along in our faithful fishing boat to the hostile new climate. Every path into the landmass is barricaded by imposing ice walls. It's a slog.\r\n\n\r\nIt’s also a great setup. We're made to instantly wonder what the hell hides in this treacherous ice field, and the answer is equally great: a massive corrupted narwhal with bulbous glowing eyes. The huge beast dwarfs your tiny ship, but mercifully it’s frozen solid in an even bigger chunk of ice, with only those very angry eyes poking out at us. Four angry eyes on one side of its head, to be very precise.\n Read more",

Now, a decade later, SteamWorld Build has reimagined Dig's core ideas as a handsome citybuilder, placing equal focus on managing your rustbucket town up top, while plundering its depths via an abandoned mineshaft to find treasure, resources and (most importantly) rocket parts, so you can escape your crumbling planet and find a new homestead up in the stars.\nDespite the threat of annihilation hanging over the horizon, however, SteamWorld Build is one of the most relaxed and easy-going building games I've ever played. This is a game that's more concerned with keeping your economy running like a well-oiled, uhh, machine than turning a profit, for example, and it merely dips its toe in the genre's wider, ongoing obsession with building up defences to fend off oncoming hordes of malicious town hall-eating nasties. If the scales do get thrown out of equilibrium, the worst that will happen is you get lots of angry little red robot faces appearing above your houses. You won't go bankrupt, you won't get turfed out for being incompetent, and you definitely won't see any kind of game over screen if the aforementioned nasties end up running amok in your mining levels. The stakes, then, are quite low, which is probably a good indication of whether you'll get on with SteamWorld Build, and how much you'll get out of it.\nRead more",

Regardless, that's a big chunk off one of the best gaming CPUs around.\r\n\n\r\nWhen Katharine reviewed the 5600X back in 2020, she called it \"a stonkingly fast gaming CPU\". It's a six-core, twelve thread processor, with each of its Vermeer processors providing speedy single-core performance, making it an ideal CPU for playing both modern multithreaded games, and older single-thread titles. There are of course plenty of faster CPUs around these days, but you'll pay significantly more for those, and it's only prudent to do so if you're looking to get the highest framerates at 1080p. If you're gaming at 4k, then it's your GPU that'll be doing most of the heavy lifting, and your funds are better spent there.\r\n\n\r\nIt's also worth noting that the 5600X is highly power efficient, with a TDP of just 65 watts. This makes it both more economical and more environmentally friendly that a lot of CPUs, an important consideration if your energy bills are making you wince.\r\n \nRead more",

But at the end of the day, a gaming mouse needs three things, a left-button, a right-button and a scroll-wheel. And this Black Friday weekend, you can get twice that many buttons three, plus some fetching RGB lighting, for less than twenty quid.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "RAM is rarely the first consideration when upgrading a PC, as it has a much smaller impact on performance compared to a better processor or a spanking new GPU. But you also won't get without far it, and we are slowly heading toward the point where more RAM is preferable. This year brought a scare when Star Wars: Jedi Survivor seemingly needed a minimum 32GB of RAM. Luckily that turned out to be an error in the system requirements, but as the size and detail of video game worlds exerts greater demand on load times, RAM will become more important. And if you want to get ahead of the game(s), you can get 32GB of rock solid ram for less than £50 this Black Friday weekend.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The 90-second-long features what looks to be mostly cutscenes, showing off a handful of locales including a massive city, a beach, and a bayou while playing Tom Petty's Love is a Long Road. The trailer ends with the GTA6 logo and coming 2025.\n\n\n\n\nEven though the trailer was scheduled to release tomorrow, the trailer leaked which prompted Rockstar Games to go ahead and officially release the trailer early. I'm sure the leak wasn't ideal, but Rockstar was pretty quick to flip the trailer live after the leak popped up.\n\n\n\nImage via Rockstar Games\n\n\nImage via Rockstar Games\n\n\nImage via Rockstar Games\n\n\nImage via Rockstar Games\n\n\nImage via Rockstar Games\n\n\nImage via Rockstar Games\n\n\nImage via Rockstar Games\n\n\nImage via Rockstar Games\n\n\nImage via Rockstar Games\n\n\nImage via Rockstar Games\n\n\nImage via Rockstar Games\n\n\n\nReturn to Vice City\n\n\nIt's been long rumored that the highly anticipated sixth entry in the Grand Theft Auto series would bring a return to Vice City, and that looks to be the case. The trailer's title card features the classic Vice City pink and orange washed-out colors. Also, about halfway through the trailer, we see a Vice sign in the style of the Hollywood sign, which almost certainly confirms it.\n\n\nEven though the video featured mostly cutscenes, it's safe to say this is exactly what everyone was hoping for: more Grand Theft Auto. Interestingly, no platforms were mentioned in the trailer. Though with a 2025 release date, it's probably safe to assume PS4 and Xbox One aren't part of the plans, though that's just speculation at this point.\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto 6 will be released in 2025.\n\n\n\nThe post Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer drops early with a 2025 release date appeared first on Destructoid.",

I wish we could get some sort of re-release, or maybe even a release of the canceled (but apparently finished) Primal Rage 2. But we’re not talking about Primal Rage. We’re here to look at DinoRex.\n\n\nReleased by Taito in 1992, DinoRex has a lot in common with Primal Rage. There are dinosaurs animated by stop-motion and humans in the foreground. I would use that same description for both games when trying to explain them to someone who hadn’t played them before. However, while Primal Rage is an “okay, not great” game, DinoRex is more of a “so bad it’s kind of good” kind of game—the very best flavor of kusoge.\n\n\nIt is just incredible.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n…",

          "description": "In a surprise trailer dropped by the Street Fighter X (formerly Twitter) account, a crossover between Street Fighter 6 and Spy x Family Code: White is coming on January 9, 2024. The event serves as a promotion for the upcoming Spy x Family film, which will be released in Japanese theaters on December 22, 2023.\n\n\nAside from collaboration activities coming to Street Fighter 6 early next year, not much information was shown in the trailer. The X post said that additional information would be coming at a later date. \n\n\n\n\nStreet Fighter 6 is no stranger to collaborations. Since its release on June 2, 2023, the fighter has joined forces with several popular franchises including Baki and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. While the Baki collaboration is relegated to fighter card aesthetics, the TMNT crossover had full-fledged costumes for all four Turtles.\n\n\nThis is where things get a little conflicting. While it was exciting to get the turtles in SF6, they came at a heavy cost, namely 750 Fighter Coins (roughly $15) each. So to get all four Turtles, players would have to drop about $60; and that didn't include all of the extras like stickers and what-have-you. Adding insult to injury was that the Turtles weren't actually characters; they were costumes for the player's avatar. Compared to the Turtles' inclusion in Injustice 2, whose pack was only $9.99 and had them as individual characters, it's kind of a raw deal in SF6.\n\n\nWhile I'm excited about the prospect of two franchises I greatly enjoy crossing over like this, I'm hesitant about how Capcom will implement it. Either we get a bland pack like Baki or we get overpriced content that isn't usable outside of Avatar Battles. Here's hoping I'm totally wrong and we get an Anya and Bond combo utilizing Psycho Power.\n\nThe post A Street Fighter 6 and Spy x Family collaboration is on the way appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "There are few fantasy creatures more fascinating than slimes, but have you wondered what it's like to be a slime? Senior technical artist at Epic Games and Slime Master Asher Zhu is working on bringing this dream to life and has shown off his results on X (Twitter).\n\n\nHe's been using the company's tools and engine to create an adorable slime game set in a modern city. The results are impressive based on a short video that shows how goopy the little guy is. It's mostly clips of it doing mundane things like roaming around and showering, but it might also be one of the best UE5 showcases for an actual game. \n\n\n\n\nThe slime's reactivity to the world around it is incredible, as the parts hanging off the slide fall off. What got me the most was seeing it mold to a tub's space with some spillover due to size.\n\n\nSince the slime is a liquid entity, Zhu's game has it interact with the world as a liquid does. This means it can conform to the space it's in, flatten itself, and evaporate in the summer sun. \n\n\nThat last part even ties into the game's premise! Keeping the slime hydrated seems to be the main goal, with showers and vending machines shown as good sources of sustenance. \n\n\nZhu has been working on a slime game for several years now, posting updates every so often. As impressive as UE5 is, most of the credit goes to Zhu for developing this specific tech for some time.\n\n\nZhu's slime game doesn't have a name or any indication of a release date, and it won't be for a while. He's clarified that it's in the prototype stages because the slime tech has been difficult to engineer. Hopefully, he continues taking his time, because the world deserves an amazing slime protagonist. \n\nThe post Game artist shows off some incredible slime tech, and I’m obsessed appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Steam hardware survey provides a general idea of the specs PC gamers are playing with — a little window into hardware expectations and trends to expect. More often than not, we see how much Nvidia creams the competition, and the latest data shows Team Green still dominates.\n\n\nAs first reported by PC Gamer, the most recent Steam hardware survey shows that, while down 4.88%, the Nvidia RTX 3060 graphics card is still at the top as of November 2023. A quick scan down the list not only shows a minimal amount of AMD and Intel, but that the 3000 series crops up quite a bit.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe 3060 laptop edition is at the number four spot, with an increase of 1.20% over the previous month. We can also see the 3050 has increased by 0.55%, while the 3070 and 3060 Ti are down slightly. It's also interesting to note that many PC gamers are still using older generation GPUs, with the GTX 1650 and GTX 1060 the second and third most popular, according to this survey.\n\n\nAda Lovelace is rising slowly\n\n\nWe already saw last month that Nvidia RTX 4000 cards were beginning to show up more in the results, and this still seems to be the case. While the RTX 4060 laptop model doesn't appear until the 11th spot, it's still up 1%.\n\n\nLikewise with the RTX 4070 Ti, which, although much further down, saw an increase of 0.18%. Even the 4090 – arguably the most powerful graphics card on the current market – saw a 0.28% rise. Additionally, the RTX 4080 went up by 0.05%. It's small, but it does show that the more enthusiast Ada Lovelace GPUs are starting to make their way into people's rigs.\n\n\nIt also goes to show just how much Nvidia seems to be the preference when it comes to PC gaming. It should be said that these Steam surveys are never 100% accurate, but they do paint a picture of the divide between the two graphics card powerhouses (three if you include Intel, which no one seems to).\n\nThe post Nvidia 3000 series still the most popular GPU, according to latest Steam survey appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Via Superflat’s own blog, Jasper Byrne recently announced that he’s working on a sequel to 2012’s indie darling Lone Survivor called Lone Warrior.\n\n\nLone Warrior is set to follow a new protagonist. Byrne says that it will be quite a bit different in terms of gameplay, with “less of a focus on stealth and survival and more of a focus on action/panic scenarios.” Aliens to Lone Survivor’s Aliens, as he puts it. He also says that it will likely be a “shorter but (hopefully) more intense game.”\n\n\nImage via Superflat\n\n\nByrne also states that he’s been working on Lone Warrior before the release of Super Lone Survivor, an updated re-release of the original game. According to him, it just made more sense to re-release the first game before revealing the second. Meanwhile, Destructoid’s own grizzled veteran Jonathan “Destroyer of Flapjacks” Holmes has said that he has seen “some behind-the-scenes stuff on this game earlier in the year, and it was really cool.”\n\n\nI played Lone Survivor back when it was released in 2012 and didn’t love it. It’s been so long that I don’t remember my specific complaints, but it was enough that I pulled the brakes early on and never went back to it. I have considered going back to it now that I’ve spent so much time wading elbow-deep through the horror genre, but haven’t yet. Mr. Holmes, on the other hand, is an enthusiastic fan, as are a lot of people who connected with it back in the early boom of the independent field of games.\n\n\nThere are no release plans for Lone Warrior so far, nor is there information on planned platforms.\n\nThe post Lone Survivor is getting a follow-up called Lone Warrior appeared first on Destructoid.",

Everything in 2024 still feels like it’s so far in the future, even though we’re talking about a couple of months.\n\n\nI’m realizing right now that I don’t know what a “colony sim” is. The Steam tag points me to everything from Frostpunk to Cult of the Lamb, which, to me, are two entirely different things. It seems to lump in survival city builders with base builders. Is Roller Coast Tycoon a colony sim?\n\n\n\n\nTime to Morp has you taking care of the eponymous Morps, horrific cat creatures that help you gather resources and explore. You build pens for them, decorate the base, explore the surroundings, and research new technologies. With this technology, you can automate jobs and make your work a lot more comfortable. There’s even four-player co-op if you can stand to associate with multiple people at the same time.\n\n\nReally, it sounds more like a farming sim that focuses mainly on livestock. A ranch sim. In fact, the Morps remind me of the slimes from Slime Rancher. But genres are made to be broken, so I’m not going to get all pedantic. Even though I already did. I do love automation, and the graphics look colorful, even if the people remind me too much of Miis.\n\n\nTime to Morp will be released on PC on February 22, 2024.\n\nThe post Automation colony sim Time to Morp releases on February 22 appeared first on Destructoid.",

While the creator is taking their time to make sure the patch is ready for release, they have made it clear that progress is coming along, while also sharing a little tease.\n\n\nOver on Twitter, Barone has shared a screenshot from Stardew Valley, showing off the new \"Big Chest\" in update 1.6. The post goes on to say that the developer has \"self-imposed\" a crunch mode to get the patch out, but made a \"ton of progress\" on it last month.\n\n\n\n\nNothing much has been said about what's coming, as the developer wants to keep \"mostly everything secret.\" However, we have had some teases in the past, such as hats for animals. But we'll know more once the update does roll out.\n\n\nA labor of love\n\n\nBarone seems clearly passionate about their game, which has gone down as one of the best indie titles in recent memory. When asked why they continue to work on Stardew Valley, the creator said: \"I want it to be the best it can be,\" adding that \"it's been my life's work and I care a lot about it.\"\n\n\nOn top of update 1.6, the game is also going on tour, with an orchestra set to travel the globe playing arrangements from the Stardew soundtrack. The tour kicks off in Los Angeles on February 16, 2024.\n\n\nOn a personal note, I'm actually fairly new to the game myself. However, I became rather hooked on its simplistic visuals, relaxing mechanics, and the sheer amount of content that's been lovingly put in.

But there are only so many times you can maximize the density of your residential zones before it loses its grip.\n\n\n2014’s Banished altered this by incorporating a survival aspect and increasing the possibility of failure. It’s been adopted by many builders since, and Against the Storm is another. And in it, we see the genre mutate further. There actually is a great deal of progression in Against the Storm that further diverges from SimCity’s “build forever” philosophy. By incorporating some aspects of the roguelite genre, it’s able to give greater meaning to your civil development strategy.\n\n\nAnd it’s very successful, so long as you are…",

Evidently, thousands don't want to risk missing what is probably one of the most anticipated teasers in years.\n\n\nAt the time of writing, there are 31,659 people currently waiting on the Rockstar Games YouTube channel, where the GTA 6 trailer will be playing. It's not scheduled to play until Tuesday, December 5 (at 9am ET, to be specific), so you'd be forgiven for thinking these eager beavers were being too keen.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, this could be a pretty historic moment for gaming. Okay, it's only a promo, but seeing as Grand Theft Auto 5 has been out for ten years now, I'd say gamers are more than ready for the follow-up.\n\n\nThe numbers just keep going up\n\n\nGiven the behemoth amount of success GTA 5 has had, there's every possibility the sixth installment could be one of the biggest releases of this – or any – generation. Obviously, I don't want to oversell it, but the fact that more than 30,000 people are waiting to watch a YouTube video that can be replayed whenever they want shows how important it is to some.\n\n\nIt was just a few weeks ago that Rockstar announced the GTA 6 trailer. We've had barely any information about the game itself, save for the big leak that happened in 2022. Outside that, nobody really knows anything about the upcoming Grand Theft Auto game.\n\n\nI must admit, I'm quite eager to check out the trailer myself. I've played most of the major entries in the series, going all the way back to the original 1997 release (Yes, I'm that old). We don't know what the teaser will show, but it's going to be on everyone's lips this side of Christmas.\n\n\nOoh, 34,750 people waiting now.\n\nThe post Tens of thousands are already ‘queuing’ for the GTA 6 trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

Then set your sights on an exciting new FPS Ground Branch, from one of the developers behind the original Ghost Recon and Rainbow Six.\n\n\nDeveloped by BlackFoot Studios and published by the simulation wizards at MicroProse, it takes the traditional tactical shooter and dials the realism up to eleven. BlackFoot boasts it puts the \"tactical back in tactical shooter,\" and they’re not wrong.\n\n\nGround Branch delivers solo and multiplayer action including co-op, player-vs-player, and objective-based game modes. It boasts an impressively in-depth customisation system where you choose exactly what you carry, all the way down to how many pouches you want on your vest. Plus, you can mount attachments virtually anywhere along your weapon. We’re absolutely spending six hours perfecting that loadout.\n\n\n\n\nThanks to Ground Branch’s True First-Person System, that degree of detail extends to the field. You have full control over your protagonist, from leaning to multiple weapon postures. That’s not just about looking cool, either. Every inch of you is modeled, so if you forget to pull your foot in, an enemy, human, or even AI soldier may just put a bullet in it.\n\n\nGround Branch is currently in Steam early access but we’ve been blown away by what we’ve seen so far. Going by the many positive Steam reviews, including the short-but-to-the-point “She's a beaut cobba,” we’re not alone.\n\n\nWith a possible price rise coming once it eventually leaves early access, there’s no better time to buy or wishlist Ground Branch on Steam.\n\n\n\n\nThe post Currently in early access, GROUND BRANCH is taking tactical shooters to the next level appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The delightfully short and sweet series of Momodora Metroidvanias is coming to a head with Momodora: Moonlit Farewell. Publisher PLAYISM and developer Bombservice describe it as \"the culmination\" of the series, and it's officially set to drop via Steam on January 11, 2024. \n\n\nYou can see a glimpse of the latest in the exploration-focused series in the release date trailer: \n\n\n\n\nThe original Momodora was released in 2010. Moonlit Farewell marks the fifth installment in Bombservice's series. \n\n\nMoonlit Farewell maintains the detailed, meticulously animated aesthetic of previous entries with a Sigil system that helps customize each run. Sigils can be found while exploring, during events, or purchased at shops. Effects range from attack boosts to increased healing effects, weapon summons, and beyond, and they can be turned off and on at any moment. Using an effective mix of attacks and Sigils sounds like it's going to be key to defeating the assortment of boss battles that await along the way. \n\n\nScreenshot via Playism\n\n\nBombservice promises improved visual effects in this one, with the aim of bringing the already established mystical world of the Momodora series to life. \n\n\nThe story of Moonlit Farewell is set five years after the events of 2014's Momodora III. This time around Koho village's High Priestess Momo has to set out to save the world from demons after a mysterious bell summoned them. Beyond the main Momodora storyline, there was also the 2016 prequel Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight and Minoria, a spiritual follow-up with similar thematic elements. \n\n\nWith just a little over a month to go before launch, we'll find out how the saga expands shortly. \n\nThe post New Momodora trailer reveals the ‘culmination’ of beloved Metroidvania franchise appeared first on Destructoid.",

Chief among them is Career Mode, which has you raising your own crab and growing along with it as you get ready to throw it into battle. \n\n\nThroughout the campaign, you can raise your crab's stats, get new skills and weapons, and climb up the ladder of ranked matches. Once you've had your fill of fighting evil crabs or other crustacean warriors online, you can pass all the obtained skills to another aspiring crab fighter. \n\n\nThere's also a new control scheme that hews closer to a traditional third-person action game, which is just one addition aiming to make Fight Crab 2 easier to play. Another is the ability for crabs to learn skills that let them automatically perform certain actions. \n\n\nAll the claw-crackin' confrontations feature live commentary, too, just in case you're not shouting over the action enough already yourself.

          "description": "With The Game Awards just around the corner, Sega has teased a new game announcement at the event. Sending teaser letters to fighting game content creators, it points towards a Virtua Fighter 6 reveal at Geoff Keighley's show. \n\n\n\n\nOn social media, content creators like Curiousjoi and Maximillian Dood have been posting images of said a press mailer they've received, a postcard that reads \"New Era New Energy. Make sure to tune in to The Game Awards December 7th.\" \n\n\nMaximillian Dood says on his Twitter post, \"Curious, have these gone out to others that are NOT huge fighting game creators?\"\n\n\nOne of the replies from Brodoof shows a screenshot from one of the Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown trailers. It has the same exact font, but the color is red instead of blue. This has led many to speculate the press mailing is setting the stage for something new in the Virtua Fighter franchise. \n\n\nImage via Sega\n\n\nSega could be planning a new Virtua Fighter with rollback netcode\n\n\nOne of the most important aspects of a modern fighting game is having a great rollback netcode. It lets players around the world battle it out and participate in tournaments online.\n\n\n\"I believe that implementing rollback will be absolutely necessary when developing future titles,\" said Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown producer Seiji Aoki when interviewed by Gamer Braves.\n\n\n\"While it’s important to create content for fighting game fans, I think it’s important to also create content that viewers or newcomers to the fighting genre can enjoy,\" Aoki said in the same interview when asked about how to keep the game interesting for both new and returning fans and how they're approaching the eSports aspect of the industry. \"For example, I can’t play soccer, but I love watching soccer.\" \n\n\nIt's just a waiting game now for eager fans to learn if Sega will revive the beloved Virtua Fighter franchise at The Game Awards. \n\nThe post Is Sega hinting at a Virtua Fighter 6 announcement for The Game Awards? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Ready to return to the world of Halo? The second season of Paramount Plus' live-action adaptation just released a first look at CCXP alongside a February 8 release date.\n\n\nThe news comes a day or two after the streaming service launched its flagship show's first season on YouTube. Unfortunately, the date was leaked via the descriptions for a bit, so it wasn't much of a surprise. However, we got our first teaser for the new season and it looks to be a ride for sure. \n\n\n\n\nI Can See Your Halo, Halo\n\n\nIn the minute-and-a-half-long trailer, we see a bunch of wide shots and some action, and the epic scale does feel a bit more on par with viewer expectations. It's just a first look, so we can expect a better picture when a full trailer comes around. For now, what we got looks, dare I say, more promising than the first. \n\n\nDespite Halo receiving mixed reviews, the viewership was record-breaking for Paramount Plus, easily prompting a season two renewal. Well, that could be attributed to its looseness in the adaptation department. I mean, the show's first episode had Master Chief take his helmet off (and if you didn't last through that, he takes off more than just that). Personally, I hope the team takes into consideration the feedback from viewers and crafts a series worthy of its fanbase. \n\n\nHalo stars Pablo Schreiber (Narcos) as Master Chief/John-117 and Jen Taylor (Halo: Combat Evolved) as Cortana, whom we got to speak to last year. The supporting cast boasts the likes of Charlie Murphy (Happy Valley), Natascha McElhone (The Truman Show), and Bokeem Woodbine (Spider-Man: Homecoming), just to name a few. So, if you have time to kill, you can watch all the episodes free of charge via this playlist and finish the fight before February 8.\n\nThe post Halo Season 2 scores February release with new first look appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Amazon Prime has officially released its teaser trailer for the upcoming Fallout series, giving fans their first look at the latest venture into the post-apocalypse. \n\n\nThe trailer comes just days after the first look at the series via a Vanity Fair exclusive. \n\n\n\n\nThe first Fallout teaser trailer is a quick slice of life of the upcoming video game adaptation. Numerous Fallout mainstays are present, such as Vertibirds, Brotherhood of Steel Paladins, an uncannily charismatic ghoul, and a host of Vault Dwellers who seem to be going through a really rough patch. \n\n\nThere are also plenty of monsters abound in the trailer, including a pretty nasty-looking Yao Guai. In true Fallout tradition, the whole thing is set to a moody 1960s soundtrack. For the trailer, it's Nat King Cole's \"I Don't Want To See Tomorrow.\" \n\n\nPrime Video's Fallout series is coming in 2024\n\n\nDeveloped for Amazon Prime Video by Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan, Fallout is based on the storied video game series known for its tongue-in-cheek humor and dark storytelling. The Fallout series is a vivid take on a potential post-apocalyptic America populated by militaristic factions, irradiated monsters, and the iconic Vault Dwellers -- individuals raised in fallout shelters who are either the most capable or most clueless people in the room. \n\n\nThe first Fallout, released in 1997, was a groundbreaking RPG experience where players were a Vault Dweller seeking a water chip to save the inhabitants of Vault 13. Today, the series is perhaps best known for its FPS/RPG hybrid games, starting with 2008's Fallout 3. \n\n\nThe latest game in the series, Fallout 76, is an attempt at an MMO that has been met with divisive reviews and staunch criticism but is somehow still going strong today.\n\n\nFirst announced in 2020, Fallout stars Walton Goggins, Ella Purnell, and Kyle MacLachlan. The series is scheduled to be released exclusively on Prime Video on April 12, 2024. \n\nThe post Prime Video’s Fallout series drops its first teaser trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

Bullet hell shoot 'em up Shinorubi has officially fired off a release date and is now lined up for consoles and PC on January 12, 2024.\n\n\nRed Art Games previously had Shinorubi penciled in for \"early 2023,\" but clearly time is running out to make that cut. When Shinorubi launches it will be available digitally on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam. Those looking to pick up a physical copy will be able to do so on day one for PS4 and PS5. As for the physical Switch release, manufacturing delays have pushed that one back to Q2 2024.\n\n\nIf you've properly steeled yourself for a full-on eyeball assault, you can see just how hellish these bullets are shaping up to be in the launch date trailer. \n\n\n\n\nThe Deluxe Edition of Shinorubi, pictured below, is limited to just 300 copies per platform and available exclusively through Red Art's online store. Copies of the PS4 and PS5 versions are still available to pre-order, but the Switch Deluxe Edition is already sold out. There's also a Shinorubi Pink Edition for Switch, which packs the game in a steelbook case with a double-sided poster and soundtrack. That one is a little less scarce at 2,000 copies.\n\n\nImage via Red Art Games\n\n\nShinorubi marks the first release from the development team at Last Boss 88, who are, as you might have guessed, huge fans of danmaku shmups.

Like Groundhog Day, you're repeating the same day over and over, but as you explore the game's world, you'll find out more about the characters and the environments you inhabit. One plus is that you don't have to be hounded by Ned Ryerson every day.\n\n\nYou're also gathering intel on each of your targets while chased down by a (sometimes player-controlled)  rival. There's a lot going on in Deathloop, but it's an intriguing take on the tired genre. \n\n\nDeathloop won multiple Game of the Year awards in 2021 from outlets such as GameSpot and the Critic's Choice award from Golden Joystick. \"Deathloop combines a classic Arkane stealthy-shooty foundation with a genuinely interesting and fun premise to aplomb,\" our review said.\n\nThe post Prime Gaming picks up Deathloop in December appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Gear up squad, we’re going to Arrakis. Activision has revealed skins for its operators revolving around the upcoming Dune: Part Two for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone Season One.\n\n\n\n\nNo date was attached to the announcement, but the models for the skins are shown. The characters Paul Atreides (Wonka’s Timothee Chalamet) and Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Elvis’ Austin Butler) got revealed and they look… a little uncanny. They both look like they’ve had a bit too much spice, in Dune terms. It’s not known if the Oscar-nominated actors will reprise their roles, as other actors like Anthony Starr for The Boys’ Homelander or Nicki Minaj as, well, Nicki Minaj.\n\n\nDune and Dusted\n\n\nYou’d be right to be a little confused with the timing of the promotion and I don’t blame you. Originally, Dune: Part Two was scheduled to release on November 3. However, due to the Hollywood strikes, the sequel was pushed to March 15, 2024. The decision to delay the highly-anticipated adaptation came in late August, so it’d be too late to push them out of Season One. Still, it is weird to see the movie be promoted through, of all means, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3.\n\n\nGranted, Dune is no stranger to video games. For promotion for Denis Villeneuve’s epic, characters Paul Atreides and Chani (Euphoria’s Zendaya) appeared in Fortnite back in 2021. Outside of shooters, Dune sticks to strategy-style gameplay, which is befitting of the book's political landscape. Last year, Shiro Games launched Dune: Spice Wars, which made it’s way to Xbox Game Pass just recently. \n\n\nFurthermore, the series is venturing into MMO territory by the folks at Funcom with Dune: Awakening.

In December, that expansion pack is expanding a little more, as Jet Force Gemini is coming to the service.</p>\n\n<p>First released in 1999, Jet Force Gemini is a third-person shooter developed by Rare, the studio originally known for the Banjo-Kazooie games, but most recently known for Sea of Thieves. It's set on a sci-fi alien world, where players blast through hordes of insect-like creatures.</p>\n\n<p>The most recent way players could experience the game on modern consoles was through Rare Replay, a compilation of classic Rare games released on the Xbox One in 2015.&nbsp; For a refresher on the game, check out this 60-second rundown Rare put out a few years back.</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Js6lrsMPk3I\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n<p>The Switch Online currently includes 26 other N64 games, including the <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/08/25/excitebike-64-races-to-nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-this-month\">recently added Excitebike 64</a>.
