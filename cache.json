Common in RPGs, open-world games, and adventure titles, sidequests offer up a plethora of activities that see you doing everything from collecting seashells to defeating dragons.

It's best described as a relaxing house moving sim but it's also a sort of block-fitting puzzle game. Finding the perfect spot for each item is largely down to your own personal taste, but there are some loose 'room rules' (no, you cannot put your toaster in the bedroom for some midnight cheese toastie action). If you like organising games - A Little To The Left, Sticky Business, Wilmot's Warehouse and the like - then Unpacking is the game for you.\nRead more",

          "description": "On the day of our interview, Exo Rally Championship programmer and composer Rhys Lindsay was preparing for a race on a hostile alien planet, and feeling pretty good about his chances. He spent a full three minutes surveying the pockmarked, potentially lethal landscape from above with a drone, marking the most dangerous terrain in advance and picking out a relatively safe route between the checkpoints. “Alright,” he thought. “I’m going to smash this stage.”\r\n\n\r\nOf course, it’s just as they say: no plan survives contact with unroaded planets wracked by extreme temperatures, meteor showers and atmospheric pressure unlike anything ever experienced on Earth. On the corner of the first checkpoint, Lindsay flipped his rover, snagging the vehicle on a rock that immediately broke his scanning systems and left him driving blind. By the time of our chat, though, he’s laughing. Exo Rally Championship is a racer for those who like to roll with the punches, quite literally - an anecdote generator for players who adore the challenge of preparing for the worst, and then adapting to changing circumstances on the fly.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Players will be able to go head to head with two of the game's four factions - the golden fantasy knights of the Stormcast Eternals and the sneaky green stink lads of the Orruk Kruleboyz - giving us our first taste of how they'll handle in battle, and the kinds of powerplays we'll be making with their respective (and rather handsome) tabletop miniature recreations. \nAnd having played four rounds of its 1v1 matches already at a press event last week, it's quite the thrill - and I say that as someone with no real attachment to Warhammer or Age Of Sigmar's specific lore legacy. The Stormcast Eternals and their flying hammer brutes are just as devastating as you'd imagine, while the lads lads lads and their Killaboss Kruleboyz are challenging late-game bloomers that will give even hardened strategy game veterans plenty to sink their teeth into. Both factions are great fun, and I'm very much looking forward to jumping back in this weekend.\nRead more",

An unassuming first-person puzzler about a puppet fisherman living in a lighthouse, it dazzled with its incredible deployment of VR's unique sense of perspective and scale. It's the kind of game that, if it featured a psychotic AI and some cake memes instead of a beard in a yellow anorak, would have been heralded as a revolution in play.\r\n\n\r\nIt would have been easy to follow-up A Fisherman's Tale in the same way, make a bigger game with a few new gimmicks and a comedy lobster voiced by Stephen Merchant. But that isn't what developer InnerspaceVR has done. Instead, Another Fisherman's Tale bends your neural pathways in entirely new forms, offering a completely different kind of puzzling. The results are equally innovative and almost as interactively satisfying - although a lack of refinement in the latter category is a deflating puncture in the game's dinghy.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Flock is the next game from the makers of Wilmot's Warehouse, Hohokum and I Am Dead, but ever since it was announced last year, I've been wondering about exactly what kind of game it is. The first trailer revealed lots of strange, whimsical environments, equally whimsical-looking beasties and a little person flying around on the back of a giant bird herding them around in delightful swoops and swirls. We also saw some sheep grazing in a meadow before they, too, started to fly alongside your wilder, more abstract animal pals. But the question of what you do in Flock remained unanswered - until last week, when developers Hollow Ponds showed us a little bit more of their creature collecting game during the Annapurna Interactive Showcase stream.\nThere, they revealed that we'll need to collect and charm these creatures to get them to join our respective flocks, and that we'll be able to do so in co-op with a pal. It looks intensely charming, but it still left me with lots of unanswered questions. So I spoke to devs Ricky Haggett and Richard Hogg to find out more. Naturally, there are some things they're not ready to reveal about Flock just yet, but they did tell me that you'll start on top of a mountain and will be wending your way down it with your flock of sheep. \nRead more",

Come prepared to talk about your favourite puzzles, the ones that stumped you, and the weird horror themes you liked best. I've thoroughly enjoyed making the team play a tough puzzle game, especially one that's intentionally retro and a bit spooky without being scary. So why not come and join in the discussion? Haha, that's a joke: you don't have a choice. As I said, you're locked in here unless you can find the Resident Evil-ass key I have hidden in here somewhere. See you at 4pm, when we'll be back to see how you're getting on.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Over a decade on from its Nintendo DS release, there's still nothing quite like Ghost Trick. In this smart murder mystery detective game from the creator of Ace Attorney, you play the recently deceased amnesiac Sissel as he attempts to piece together his own demise. Who killed him? And why? And what's the deal with these newfound powers he has to turn back time and manipulate inanimate objects in his vicinity? That definitely wasn't in the ghostbusting 101 manual. Alas, he doesn't have long to find out, as he'll cross over to the afterlife in the morning. Thus begins a frantic night of whodunnit puzzling at its finest, with director Shu Takumi showing us exactly what he's made of outside the courtroom dramas he built his name on. \nRead more",

While most of the announcements were updates on games we already knew about, there are a couple of cool new things in there that I'm personally quite pumped for, including a new Blade Runner game being developed internally at Annapurna Interactive, a new Keita Takahashi joint about a kid stuck in a T-pose of all things, and a new ghostly biking game from the team behind Nidhogg. I'd highly recommend watching the showcase in full if you can, but in case you need a quick refresher of what happened, or are just short on time, we've rounded up every announcement in order below. \nRead more",

Both were similar titles that take the Kunio-Kun/Downtown/Nekketsu/River City beat-’em-up formula started in 1986’s Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun/Renegade and cemented in 1989’s Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari/River City Ransom. Chubby arms, pained expressions, and lots of smacking take center stage in these games.\nhttps://youtu.be/-DMyaNUrF4o\nThe new port of River City: Rival Showdown will include all the features of the 3DS version but will also include a brand new prequel story called Cold-Blooded Hardcore Yamada-kun. Beyond that, there will also be spiffier graphics and some quality-of-life improvements.\nI’d call myself a huge fan of the Kunio-Kun/Downtown/Nekketsu/River City games, but I’ve had trouble getting myself into the more modern titles. I own River City: Rival Showdown on 3DS. I just couldn’t tell you why I haven’t played more than a few minutes of it.\nOh, wait, yes, I can. It was a horrible time in my life. I wish I hadn’t remembered that.\nIn any case, I’ll hopefully be giving this one another chance. If you haven’t already, you should definitely check out Double Dragon & Kunio-kun: Retro Brawler Bundle. It has all the Famicom games in the Kunio-Kun/Downtown/Nekketsu/River City series, but they’ve gone the extra mile and localized all the ones that were previously Japan-only. Seriously, an impressive effort.\nRiver City: Rival Showdown will be releasing on PC, Switch, and PlayStation on October 12, 2023.\nThe post River City: Rival Showdown is coming to new platforms appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Are you there, God?\nCrate Entertainment has revealed what it has in store for the August update of their Early Access survival city-builder, Farthest Frontier. The headline feature here is a new religion system, but it also promises paper industry and guild halls.\nFarthest Frontier is coming up on a year in early access. It’s a “colony sim” or a “survival city builder.” This burgeoning sub-genre has followed in the wake of the success of 2014’s Banished. It seems a lot of developers felt tired of waiting for a sequel to Banished and have decided to create their own sequels, each tying in a different twist. The base is that you need to focus on the survival of your settlers, but from there, the concept has gone in some interesting directions.\nI’ve actually played Farthest Frontier, and while it’s not as big of a twist as Timberborn’s beaver people, it’s definitely a solid game, even in its current state. It’s detailed, pretty, and has that nice mix of relaxing and stressful.\nHowever, there’s room to expand, and religion sounds like it will be a great addition. Nothing livens up a peasant’s sad existence quite like the fear of an unhappy deity. The central mechanic of religion is finding relics that will “inspire reverence” and provide your people with perks. Personally, I prefer a good sacrifice, but this sounds good too.\nThere is also the introduction of the paper industry, which will allow you to create books; a luxury item for your settlers. There are also guild halls that will boost a chosen industry in your settlement, allowing you to pick your focus. In the future, Crate Entertainment is teasing tweaks to combat, quality of life, mods, and the addition of new livestock. Hopefully ducks.\nFarthest Frontier is currently available on PC via Early Access. The update is planned for release in August.\nThe post Farthest Frontier shows off its big August update appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Where there's Smoke...\nA fan-favorite is confirmed to be returning to the Mortal Kombat grinder. Today's new trailer for Mortal Kombat 1 reveals both Rain and Smoke will appear in the new entry.\nSmoke is a well-liked member of the Lin Kuei, who finally gets a human re-debut in Liu Kang's new era. Here, Smoke is a fellow member of the Lin Kuei who joins with Scorpion and Sub-Zero to defend Earthrealm.\nAlso arriving is Rain, a High Mage of Outworld who wields water magic. He's looking a bit more robed and wizard-like, compared to his original palette-swapped appearance.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66opZ1Go_ZA\nSome Kameo fighters also make an appearance here, too. Scorpion pops up, of course. But the cyborg side of the Lin Kuei appears, too; Sektor and Cyrax are in as Kameos, as well as a human version of Frost.\nFor our two main roster fighters, both look pretty excellent. Smoke is obviously a highlight. His teleportation and quick jabs look fantastic, and that knife looks devastating in the X-ray attacks. Rain, meanwhile, is like a Waterbender that gets to actually do some damage with their aquatic magic. I really dig the big lightning ball attack that he can call down from a raincloud.\nKombat history\nThe Kameo fighters bring their own flavor too, and it's nice to see the cyborgs appear. I was curious about whether they would. With a new era and re-envisioned versions of characters, having the robo-fighters reappear or not felt up in the air.\nAfter playing it at SGF 2023, though, it definitely seemed like Kameos are NetherRealm's way of including more fan-favorites from its ever-expanding universe without having to make them fully fledged fighters right away. If it keeps up the nostalgia and klassic references, I could see this being a really enjoyable experience for long-time MK fans.\nMortal Kombat 1 arrives on September 19, 2023.\nThe post Mortal Kombat 1 trailer unleashes Smoke, Rain, and more Kameos appeared first on Destructoid.",

But since IO Interactive split with Square-Enix, they’ve hinted at wanting to return to it.

And right now, Season 1 of Diablo 4 has the potential to bring ARPG fans together, or drive them even further apart.\nWhen D4 finally got announced, it didn't take long to start hearing two claims from ARPG fans. It was common to hear either \"Diablo 4 will kill Path of Exile!\" or \"Diablo 4 won't have good enough content to compete with Path of Exile!\". With over 100 hours in D4 so far, and almost 1,500 hours in PoE over the years, let me tell you: the two games can certainly co-exist in the ARPG genre. While both games are ARPGs, their end-game systems—and there…",

Nintendo had come out swinging with their new console, but their fists had hit very little meat. A number of certifiable classics beloved to this day came out in its first few years, but the console still managed to lose further ground to its competitors. Still, that year we got some memorable titles like Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, Pikmin 2, and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door.\nOf those games I just named, I only love one of them, and it’s not the one we’re talking about.\nIn preparation for Pikmin 4, Nintendo surprise-dropped HD versions of Pikmin 1 and 2.

          "description": "This is the Dark Souls of Darkslides\nA long time ago, Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance featured a minigame where we could use the Big Shell as a skate park. Yes, you weren't dreaming that up. It was glorious, but we would rarely see similar fever dreams like that again — up until very recently.\nA gameplay clip titled Dark Souls Pro Skater has emerged online, and it's exactly what you'd expect. Naturally, people are raving over how rad it looks.\nhttps://twitter.com/SavinTheBees/status/1676019593918451712?s=20\nSkate or Prepare to Die\nThe clip shows fan-favorite Solaire of Astora showing off his high skating stats as he performs all sorts of sick tricks in a skate park-ified version of Firelink Shrine. You don't need me to tell you which 1997 ska-punk track accompanies the footage.\nThe good news is that Dark Souls Pro Skater isn't some pre-alpha mod someone just began in their garage. It's a combination of Tony Hawk's Underground 2 mods that anyone can get for free. If you want to try this out, acquire a copy of THUG 2 and install the THUGPro mod. Then you can get the Firelink Skate park here, and Solaire's skin here. THUGPro is a whole world, so dive into its content and find other cool stuff that you'll like.\nMaybe the positive response to this clip will inspire some clever map designers out there to turn areas such as Anor Londo into skate parks as well. Like, who knows if even the widely despised Lost Izalith area could find new life and even some love as a skating ground?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooP2_Vd8dk4\nIf you love Souls games but skateboarding isn't your thing, then perhaps consider waiting for Bloodborne Kart to come out to give it a go. Yes, that's also real and won't even require you to own the original Bloodborne.\nThe post You can skate on Dark Souls’ Firelink Shrine in Tony Hawk’s Underground 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

It has big crunchy pixels and lots of text boxes. However, looking at all the media for it – it looks like a dating sim.\nhttps://youtu.be/vz8yPQ_yxzo\nIt might be partially due to the eponymous police-thing browsing a dating site, but that’s not what I’m talking about. We’re told that there are seven days for the former traffic cop to solve the crime, and you do so by choosing how you spend your days. You can upgrade your skills, look after your core stats, and the outcome is based entirely on how you spend your time. Almost like a true dating sim. This is Tokimeki Memorial but with more crime. And probably a lot less dating.\nRegardless of its classification, Sergeant Squidley: Space Cop is aiming to be an open-ended experience. Through your choices, Mr. Squidley might reconnect with his estranged son, follow his sax dreams, or maybe become a super-cop of some sort. What’s important here? Sax dreams or catching a murderer.

If you fancy your chances at earning an honest buck in this turn of the century RPG, there's a mod you can download that lets you become a fine, upstanding worker.\nConsidered by many to be one of the best open-world games of all time, you may feel sad that Arthur Morgan's life of crime has come to an end. In which case, \"Jobs - Expanded and Enhanced\" could be just what you're looking for. Uploaded to Nexus Mods by user Shtivi, you can now experience what it's like to get a regular job in Red Dead Redemption 2.\n[caption id=\"attachment_390274\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"] Image via Shtivi/Nexus Mods.[/caption]\nAs the name implies, you'll be able to take on a number of vocations in order to make ends meet. Such examples include being a mail man, chauffeur, or ranch hand. If you don't feel ready to give the tough life up just yet, you can take on wagon protection. This is actually an updated version of a previous mod, originally made by user Bolmin. Additionally, this recent upload claims to be a complete makeover, which includes \"new mechanics and new jobs.\"\nIt's not always about the rootin' 'n' tootin'\nWith such stunning beauty and character development, the second installment in Rockstar's Red Dead Redemption series is often held aloft as an example of great game design. It's worth diving into this Wild West adventure again, for the vistas alone if nothing else.\nRockstar is no longer supporting it, but at least the developer can dedicate more time to GTA 6, whenever that's coming. We can't tell if Red Dead Redemption 2 will recieve a followup at this stage.

Blizzard revealed a new trailer along with details of the content update in a livestream today. \nSeason of the Malignant introduces a new questline set after the main campaign in which Malignant Monsters, born from Lilith’s corruption, are terrorizing Sanctuary.

The following year, at The Game Awards 2021, Bokeh revealed Slitterhead. Thanks to a new development diary released today, we can peek at more early-development gameplay in action. \nMost of the video focuses on the developers working on Slitterhead, with a particular look at user tests and gameplay feedback. However, sprinkled throughout the diary are new clips of Slitterhead, ranging from training room-esque encounters, some clips of a neon-lit Chinese city, and even a dog that appears to be playable. \nCheck it out for yourself: \n\n\nAs you can see in the small and often blurred snippets of Slitterhead gameplay, the studio's debut game continues to look grotesque. We see a character attack enemies using Wolverine-like claws, guns, and more. Oh, and below is that playable dog: \nIn 2020, the studio said its debut horror game would be released in 2023. But there's no word on whether the team still anticipates releasing it this year. And given how early in development today's gameplay looks, it's looking more like a 2024 or beyond game. \nAre you excited about Slitterhead? Let us know in the comments below!",

That gets remedied a bit with the announcement that Stadium Stampede is hitting the game in an upcoming free update. \nStadium Stampede sees up to 30 wrestlers compete in a free-for-all inside a giant empty stadium. Like the real-life version, insanity is the name of the game, as players can assault each other using whatever is around them, whether it's chairs, tee shirt guns, Molotovs, golf carts, or even ride atop a horse. The last competitor standing wins, and the reveal trailer sells how much of a goofy mess it’s going to be (in a good way, hopefully). \n\n\nUnfortunately, there's no release date for this update other than that it's coming soon. AEW: Fight Forever has other DLC heading its way in the form of downloadable wrestler packs. FTR (Dax Harwood and Cash Wheeler) were added last month, and a pack containing Keith Lee and The Bunny becomes available on July 25. The final announced pack arrives on August 22 and adds Hook and Danhausen. Each of these packs also includes two new minigames. Each pack costs $11.99 and is included with the season pass. \nFor more on AEW: Fight Forever, check out our review here.",

But a recent report from Kotaku suggests that the company's commitment to the franchise might be going even deeper than we thought; Ubisoft has recently begun the process of remaking Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. \nThe remake is currently in \"its earliest stages,\" Kotaku reports, so details are scarce, and we won't be seeing it officially for a few years. A team at Ubisoft Singapore, a branch that has contributed to almost every mainline Assassin's Creed game, is said to be heavily involved. Most notably, Ubisoft Singapore worked on the creation of naval combat for Assassin's Creed III and IV, a success that would place it at the head of development for Ubisoft's naval-focused game, Skull and Bones. Of course, Skull and Bones is now notorious for its years of repeated delays – fans of Black Flag will just have to hope the seas will be calmer for the studio's next project.\n\n\nBlack Flag was released in 2013 on the eve of a new console generation, coming to PS3 and 360, but also to PS4, Xbox One, and Wii U. The game follows Edward Kenway – the pirate grandfather of the protagonist Connor from Assassin's Creed III – as he plunders the Caribbean and stumbles into the Assassin Brotherhood. Combining the series' classic stealth gameplay with naval exploration and combat, it's widely regarded as one of the franchise's best entries.

The first game to publicly use it was Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, which caused many to dub the engine the Resident Evil engine, which is not what the ‘RE’ stands for. Instead, the acronym is confusingly shorthand for Reach for the Moon. In Japan, the Resident Evil series is called Biohazard, which is why Exoprimal technical director Kazuki Abe is surprised that anyone ever thought the engine was named after the survivor horror series . “It’s really just a matter of coincidence that Resident Evil games are also developed using this engine.”\nSince Resident Evil 7, RE Engine has been used to develop Resident Evil Village, the Resident E…",

The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey. \nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

Some love it, some despise it, and PlayStation fans will get to see which side of the fence they fall on when it hits PlayStation 5 this fall.\nDespite appearing like a shooter on its surface, Scorn is an atmospheric puzzle-focused experience. As a strange humanoid creature, you’ll explore a labyrinthian H.R. Giger-inspired alien world to unravel its mysteries. While combat is present, it’s very much secondary to deciphering the abstract story and riddles, and even those revelations will primarily be up to your interpretation. \nThe PlayStation 5 version features DualSense haptic feedback support and 4K/60 fps gameplay.

And now we know that game is Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth. As the name suggests, it takes place in 2033, which puts it between the original film and its sequel, Blade Runner 2049. Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth takes place in a dystopian Los Angeles like its cinematic predecessors, and the game's events occur after the Blackout hits. \nNot much else was revealed about the game, but you can check out its moody cinematic trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, this game looks very Blade Runner, and we can't wait to learn more about it. Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth's development is led by game director Chelsea Hash, who previously served as the director of Solar Ash and technical art lead on What Remains of Edith Finch. \nAnnapurna Interactive says Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth is the first new Blade Runner game for consoles and PC in development in 25 years. It's due out sometime in the future on consoles and PC, but there's no word on when to expect it.

          "description": "In the 21st century, fans of the NFL have had minimal choices when it comes to their officially licensed football games. Ever since 2004, EA Sports' annualized Madden NFL series has been the exclusive franchise for the NFL, its teams, stadiums, and players. The result was the closure of other franchises, such as the competitive NFL 2K series, as well as the arcade-focused NFL Blitz franchise (which was later acquired by EA in 2011). The recently announced Wild Card Football from Saber Interactive, part of the Playgrounds franchise, hopes to smash through the established line to give players a fresh 7-on-7 arcade-facing take on the sport starring their favorite players.\nWild Card Football doesn't possess the NFL license, but rather the NFLPA license. This means the teams and stadiums of the…",

          "description": "While game delays have become commonplace, the opposite is extremely rare. Today, we learned Baldur's Gate 3 is somehow doing both at the same time. Initially planned for August 31, developer Larian Studios is advancing the PC release date to August 3 while delaying the PS5 version to September 6. According to the most recent community update, the change was done to prioritize release in order of platform readiness. More specifically, the team needed a little more time to get the PS5 version up to 60 frames per second.\n\"The PlayStation 5 version will be released roughly a week later than its originally scheduled date of August 31st,\" the community update reads. \"Baldur’s Gate 3 is targeting 60 frames-per-second and we’re close to achieving that on the platform but need a bit more extra time. We don’t want to compromise on quality, and feel it would be a shame to downscale to 30fps or make other compromises to hit an arbitrary date.\"\nMeanwhile, the PC version has moved up a whopping four weeks. Larian says, \"This means the PC version of Baldur’s Gate 3 will be released at a time where you’ll have more time to play it,\" likely in reference to the release of Starfield, Bethesda's massive upcoming open-world RPG. By releasing their game over a month earlier, it's a little less likely that gamers would have to choose one or the other to devote their time to.\nThe community update also casts a light cantrip on some of the features coming to the full game, including new spells, the addition of feats, the Half-Orc and Dragonborn races, the monk class, and a huge line-up of new subclasses, which you can see listed below.\nFor more Baldur's Gate 3, check out its Summer Game Fest trailer that revealed Jason Issacs' role in the game.",

While worldbuilding can be as simple as creating fictional characters and cities, some creators dive in deeply, crafting pantheons of gods, hundreds of years of wars and conflict, and even entire languages. While it makes the world more believable, it can be incredibly disorienting for an audience to be thrust headfirst into a sea of unfamiliar proper nouns, especially before they have a chance to get to know the world's characters.

However, it’s also already the second best selling game of 2023, behind Hogwarts Legacy. \nWhat’s even more impressive is that Circana’s Tears of the Kingdom numbers do not include digital sales for the game – only physical, according to Circana executive director Mat Piscatella.

Similar to Pokemon Showdown, Temtem Showdown is all about battling. It's also free to everyone. \n\"Temtem Showdown takes the best Temtem competitive action and places it within immediate reach for everyone,\" a press release reads. \"Get to know the colorful critters from the massively multiplayer creature-collection adventure, build your team in seconds, and dash into battle to test it out against other players and their teams – or carefully curate a plan of action to overpower your opponents.\" \nUnlike Temtem, which is a multiplayer Pokemon-like game where you catch and train Temtem to use in 2 vs. 2 battles, Showdown will let players build a team from scratch right from the jump. And then you can hop right into a battle, without needing to worry about their level like you might in the base game. You can play against other players both casually and competitively, and the latter will feature a ranked system and a ladder to climb up as you play. \nCrema says Showdown will receive regular balance patches to keep the meta fair, and new Seasons will bring additional content and changes as well. \nFor more, read our thoughts on the base game in Game Informer's Temtem review.",

          "description": "A stalwart party exploring the unknown, seeking the fabled Inner Sanctum. But all is not what it seems in the world of Varn...\nThe ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for the PC version of the first game of the Might and Magic series: Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Two modes are supported:\nThe original look and feel of the game (sound, which in the original consisted of merely the occasional beep, is not supported)\nA ScummVM-exclusive enhanced mode, which uses the interface of the later Xeen games, including niceties such as better character screens, automapping, and sound effects. It also integrates the impressive \"Might and Magic 1 Graphics Overhaul Mod\", which provides better in-game map and monster graphics. The xeen.cc file is required from Might and Magic: IV or Might and Magic: World of Xeen.\nBoth modes allow saving your game anywhere outside of combat via the ScummVM Global Main Menu (unlike the original game that only saved a single roster when checking into an inn). So make sure you save regularly, just in case you encounter problems.\nHelp us test both game modes by grabbing a daily build and adding mm.dat to the same folder as your game files. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way.\nNow, go forth, and discover the true secrets of the game that started the long running epic fantasy series!\n>",

          "description": "As I write this many of the development team and other members of the community are busy having fun at a meet-up in Brussels. Not me though, I’m stuck here doing a release. We’ve been busy refactoring quite a lot of the underlying code to make future changes easier, but along the way we’ve found and fixed a few more bugs and quality of life improvements that we figured were worth releasing sooner than whenever 14.0 comes along. Notably, OpenTTD will now automatically disable hardware acceleration if it detects that the last crash happened while initialising the graphics driver. While hardware acceleration works well for the vast majority of people, it causes crashes for people that then required command line arguments or manual config file editing to get it to work. This should be a better solution for those users. Additionally, there is a change to the default mouse mode on Linux to improve experience when dragging the map (and often to match expected behaviour in other games). As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. While you’re at it, have you seen the post about the upcoming addition of a automated opt-in survey to OpenTTD 14? If you have opinions, we’d like to hear them! Details here. Download Changelog Bug tracker",
