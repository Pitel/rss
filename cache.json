          "description": "The Pokémon MOBA showcases its competitive chops in August.\nBefore last year, a Pokémon spin-off in the style of League Of Legends felt like an obscure offshoot, even for a franchise that’s pitched Pikachu as a coffee-swilling detective. In many ways, a Pokémon MOBA makes considerable sense – as a world filled with hundreds of unique monsters and built on battling – but it’s the first time we’ve seen the franchise adapted into a team-based multiplayer game that’s largely propped up by its popularity as an esport.\nPokémon Unite is pitched as an accessible entry point into an intimidating genre, and by most metrics, it’s successful. There are annoyances with the free-to-play model, like the overwhelming amount of in-game currencies and a general lack of polish, but its shorter 10-minute matches, emphasis on scoring points, and reliable, speedy matchmaking, make the experience far more approachable and instantly gratifying in comparison to League of Legends or Dota.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The US/EU version of the game took a fairly hefty 66% of the vote, beating out the more restrained Japan edition.

          "description": "Shoooryuken!\nIf you're into anime, then chances are you can remember the first movie or TV show that got you hooked on the medium; your \"gateway drug\", if you will. For some, it might be TV shows like DragonBall Z or One Piece, others perhaps a specific movie like Ghost in the Shell or Akira (indeed, I had to really go back through the memory archives to determine whether Akira was the first one for me; it was definitely incredibly early in my life). For me, however, the very earliest memory I have of watching anime was the incredible video game adaptation, Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie, released in 1994.\nI'll admit, I wasn't super into the Street Fighter series when I was young. In fact, it probably wasn't until Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike that I really started to take notice. I did, however, dabble in Street Fighter II': Special Champion Edition on the Mega Drive. I was terrible at it, naturally, since I was still in single figures at the time, but I really enjoyed playing as Ryu or Ken and just spamming the 'Hadoken' move non-stop (which still wasn't quite enough to win most of the time, granted).\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Every Mario Kart, as ranked by you.\nBack when Nintendo announced the very first Mario Kart game in the early '90s, there were some in the industry who proclaimed it as a sign that the veteran firm had finally lost its marbles. Sure, Mario had appeared in other games, but his forte was 2D platformers – he had no place on the racing track, and Super Mario Kart was initially viewed as a questionable attempt to shoe-horn the famous mascot into a genre where he simply didn't belong. As you might expect, when these same nay-sayers actually got to play it, they changed their tune.\nSince then, Mario Kart has become one of Nintendo's most successful properties and has sold in excess of 160 million copies worldwide across all titles. But, you may well ask, which one is best? That's not an easy question to answer in a series of solid gold console classics, so we turned to you, dear readers, to rate and rank every game in the series.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

I've finally played Hollow Knight. In fact, I've apparently played it for 28.5 hours, which is a lot of bug-time. And there's so much to talk about from that entire day's worth of playing! The melancholy, the audio work, the music, the cuteness... but instead, as you can tell from the title, I want to talk about how Hollow Knight contributes to a legacy that has existed since the very first days of gaming: The need to take notes.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Out of ammo.\nThe live-action adaptations of the Resident Evil franchise have had a real rough time of it, huh? Paul W.S. Anderson’s six-movie take on the series — while commercially successful — was widely slated by fans of the games and critics alike for diverting too far away from the tone and scope of Capcom’s source (plus, some of them were just straight up bad), and the 2021 reboot, Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City, didn’t fare much better. Despite being significantly more faithful to the games, Johannes Roberts’ movie was criticised for its writing and attempts to cram as much fan-service into one movie as possible.\nWhen Netflix announced its own take on Resident Evil via an eight-episode series, fans were understandably sceptical that the streaming juggernaut could pull off what Anderson and Roberts failed to do. Not only that, but initial details on the series set off alarm bells immediately: a series focusing on the daughters of Albert Wesker? What? It didn’t sound promising, particularly when show-runners would later promise that the series would tie in with the game series' canon.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Not that I'm complaining, I'm more than happy that our amphibian friends are getting the love they deserve and one such game is Time On Frog Island, a cosy adventure where you play as a gruff sea captain who has been shipwrecked on an island that is chock-a-block with, you guessed it, frogs.\nRead more",

          "description": "Prime Day 2022 comes just as the global graphics card market slowly emerges from a devastating crypto-coma. That means some prices are back to normal, some aren’t, and the entire concept of a deal becomes kind of nebulous and squishy. And yet, there will undoubtedly be people out there desperate for a new graphics card – any new graphics card – so let’s take a look at what’s out there.\r\n\n\r\nThe bad news is that the vast majority of Prime Day GPU “deals” still reach above the respective card’s original retail price. The good news is that I’ve found a small handful of offers that are, if nothing else, good value by the incredibly whacked-out standards of the past two years. First up, there are a couple of Nvidia GeForce RTX 30 series cards worth considering in the UK, including an MSI-made RTX 3070 (that Ebuyer have price matched). Sticking with RTX cards, which can run both DLSS and DLAA, GameStop have a reasonable RTX 3060 deal for US buyers.\r\n\n \nRead more",

You do not need to prize open your powerwasher with a tri-wing screwdriver or manage your finances via a convoluted banking app or determine whether a kitchen sink delivers enough pressure. Instead, you wash things with power: you power wash. You wash, powerfully.\nAfter a year in early access, the game's launching in full with a variety of modes and I cannot stress enough how stress-less the experience is.

To me, the Steam Deck did not do anything not already covered by the four different video game boxes I already own. The largest advantage afforded by the Steam Deck, the ability to play cool games on a handheld device, was surely the domain of the Nintendo Switch - a console that I personally use about once a year. Usually the process is that I go \"Oh yeah!\", pick up the Switch, and contemplate buying Breath Of The Wild before I see that it has not depreciated in value whatsoever since it came out five years ago. Then I turn off the Switch. \nLast week, though, I picked up the Switch, saw that Tangle Tower was on sale, and played it through in one go. \"This is great!\", I thought, marvelling at how I could play a game while sitting on the sofa, but leaving the TV free for my partner to watch whatever stupid TV show he wanted. I went to look for other cool indie games that might be on sale on the Switch, and that's when I discovered that the Switch eshop is hot garbage unless you know specifically what you're looking for. So now I want a Switch.\nRead more",

Naturally, curiosity got the better of me, so I dipped my toe back in to see what teenage Katharine had been blogging about in the mid to late 00s. Aside from all my custom images having been eaten, probably with the closure of whatever photo upload service I used back in the day, everything else was pretty much in tact. \nBut man alive. Those OPINIONS. Just terrible. Bad, awful, narrow-minded. In some ways it's quite funny looking back at how angry I was about Nintendo putting trains in a Zelda game, for example (joke's on me, Spirit Tracks would go on to become one of my fav Zelda games of all time), but in many ways I'm just quite glad I've (hopefully) moved on as a person, if only because recent weeks have reminded me there are still plenty of people out there like late 00s Katharine who are in all likelihood the same age I am now. Yes, I'm talking about the backlash to Return Of Monkey Island.\nRead more",

          "description": "Madison is a fun game to write about. It's a puzzle horror game set in your traditional haunted house, aiming at a P.T. or Layers Of Fear vibe down the viewfinder of a Polaroid camera. Said camera was a second-hand gift for Luca's (that's you!) 16th birthday. It is also possessed by a demon, which is where the fun comes in, \"fun\" here meaning jump scares and hallucinatory clocks. Let that be a lesson to anyone thinking of getting their son something that was evidence in a murder as a present. This is one of many bad choices characters in Madison made. They are mostly now dead.\nThe game itself sometimes makes very good choices, though it's about 50/50 that it goes a bit too weird and ends up being silly. This makes for an intriguing mixture, especially with a complicated story of murder and neglect spanning decades, and by the end I was extremely fond of the way the sublime and the ridiculous sat side by side. The main let down isn't that Madison sometimes makes you giggle by accident, but that its multi-stage puzzles become so drawn out that you stop jumping at creepy angels and terrifying violin squeals.

Still a few months left to delay it again if necessary, but fingers crossed.\nRead more",

          "description": "Back in the mists of time, I actually had a hands on with Ubisoft's pirate 'em up Skull And Bones once. In my memory of it, I was an adolescent, which was categorically not the case and probably more a product of the booths at Gamescom being very tall, not to mention the hands on taking place so very long ago. At that time, the game was essentially the naval combat bit from AC: Black Flag, carved out and extended to be its own thing. Now, years later and with many delays and reworks bobbing about in its wake, Skull And Bones is back, and looking a bit different.\nThe current state of play for Skull And Bones was revealed with a livestream tonight, featuring an explainer video walking you through some of the game features, a chonk of the game in piratical action, and a surprisingly close release date confirmation for the 8th of November 2022 (there's still time for it to be delayed again!). All those extra months in the oven have produced a decidedly Sea Of Thieves-shaped bun. But this one is all realistic and gritty, more complicated, and is taking itself seriously. You won't catch Skull And Bones announcing its new season features with a comedy song, that's for sure.\nRead more",

It's Namco sequel Dragon Saber, now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.\nReleased into arcades in 1990, Dragon Saber is the follow-up to 1987's fantasy-themed blaster Dragon Spirit, and once again sees dragon-riding heroes take to the skies to battle armies of strange, invading creatures. As Huey and Siria, one or two players can jump into all-new simultaneous co-op action, which should give you a bit of balance against the hundreds of enemies and end-of-level guardians. In addition, Dragon Saber features a selection of new power-ups, along with a continuation of the game's lore, which was something of a novelty in the shmup genre at the time.\nUnlike its predecessor, Dragon Saber did not receive a wide range of ports, only coming home in the form of a lone PC Engine edition. Aside from appearances on Namco's previous compilations, this Arcade Archives release represents the first global release of the sequel in some years. Dragon Saber is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nYou can check out the button-punching action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber World of Longplays.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po0x3MLt2ns\nThe post Dragon Spirit sequel Dragon Saber takes flight on the Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

Thus, those versions of the game need a little more time in the oven.\n\"We are working very hard to finish the extra work, with our goal being to release the game on the Switch as soon as possible, sometime within the next couple of months at most,\" reads the statement.\nThe PC version, meanwhile, is still on track for a Steam launch on July 28. However, controller support will not be available for PC players at launch. That will come at a later date, \"within the same time frame.\"\nhttps://twitter.com/bearbreakfast/status/1547955848516759555\nBuilding a bed and breakfast\nWhile no date's been set, at least PC players can still get hands-on with the game this month. At least, so long as you're okay with mouse and keyboard, rather than a controller.\nBear and Breakfast is a charming-looking life sim game about a bear, running its own bed and breakfast. Having popped up at a few showcases over the last year or so, it seems to be all about attracting customers and gradually renovating your establishment.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmA6s_fVUHw\nIt's a fun take on a management sim-style game, and I really love the look of it. For a little extra time to make sure the controller support works alright, waiting's no issue.\nPC players will get to open their establishments early on July 28, while Switch and controller users will be waiting just a while longer for Bear and Breakfast.\nThe post Bear and Breakfast delays Switch launch, PC still on track for July appeared first on Destructoid.",

I just knew it was ridiculous, and sure enough, I found it based on that fact alone.\nI don’t know. Initially, I thought it might not be that bad. There’s a cheesy ‘90s CGI cutscene that seems to go on forever and doesn’t make much sense unless you read the story in the instruction manual, but the presentation seems like whoever made the UI maybe sort of cared.

For 600 platinum you'll net a memo pad.\nAnnounced by way of My Nintendo news, the reward will contain \"full color images\" of both versions of new protagonist Shez, as well as several key characters in the narrative (including members of the titular \"three\" houses). Typically it takes roughly 1-2 weeks for these rewards to go primetime.\nHere's the full description from Nintendo:\n\"Jot down battle strategies, take notes, or simply doodle 'til you drop with this full-color memo pad themed after the new Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes game for the Nintendo Switch system. Its pages feature stunning character art of new protagonist Shez (both male and female variants), Arval, Edelgard, Dimitri, and Claude.\"\n\nCurrently the listing is not live. In fact, if you click on it, it'll bring you to this random printable Triangle Strategy box art cover page. But having followed rewards like this closely for some time, I wouldn't expect it to sell out instantly. In fact, several recent rewards like the Mario Strikers bag and the Switch Sports cooling towel are still up for grabs.

If you're in the mood to look at some badass dark-fantasy imagery, it's never too late. Udon Entertainment has issued reprints of the Design Works books for the whole trilogy.\nThe main difference with these reprints is that they sport new cover art. I'm sure some readers will prefer the original tome-like cover design, which is classy, but I'll admit that I'm a sucker for the crazed Gwyn concept art — that fiery backdrop really pops.\nThese hardcover books focus on concept art, key visuals, and character and monster designs, but there are …",

Developer CyberConnect2 confirms that it plans to release Fuga: Melodies of Steel 2.\nMelodies of Steel 2 will be a direct sequel to the first game. Not much else is known at the moment, but more news is planned for July 28. A \"Fuga: Melodies on the Battlefield\" anniversary stream is planned for that date.\nhttps://twitter.com/Fuga_CC2_en/status/1547783715476357121\nAdditionally, the first game Fuga: Melodies of Steel is on sale for 30% off on the eShop until July 24. A demo is also available, with everything up to Chapter 3 playable and saves transferrable to the full game.\nRev up that Soul Cannon\nIf you're unfamiliar with the first game, Fuga: Melodies of Steel is an RPG about a bunch of young animal children and their giant tank. No, seriously. It follows a band of misfits who commandeer an all-powerful tank to fight back against an evil empire.\nIt's got a timeline-based battle system where you need to swap around different party members on each of the gun emplacements. Certain weapons tackle enemy types like fliers or smaller ground tanks better, and characters can learn new abilities over time.\nAnd of course, if all else fails, there is the Soul Cannon. Basically a giant win card that will offer automatic victory in key fights, at the cost of a party member's soul. It's uh, bleak, to say the least.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFGO3bHkNB4\nStill, it wound up being a surprisingly fun time that I was glad I tried out last year. It's got some really cool ideas with its party management, battle systems, and Metal Slug-style tank designs. The demo's worth giving a shot if any of that appeals to you, and I'm pretty intrigued in seeing what's in store for the 28th.\nThe post CyberConnect2 confirms Fuga: Melodies of Steel 2 is on the way appeared first on Destructoid.",

The $3.6 billion deal brings Destiny into the PlayStation lineup. However, Destiny will continue to publish on multiple platforms. SIE president Jim Ryan said at the time that the deal is part of Sony's strategy to expand the reach of PlayStation to a wider audience.\n\"We understand how vital Bungie’s community is to the studio and look forward to supporting them as they remain independent and continue to grow,\" Ryan told GI Biz. \"Like Bungie, our community is core to PlayStation’s DNA, and our shared passion for the gamer and building the best place to play will now evolve even further.\"\nDeals still in the works\nWhile the Sony and Bungie agreement is now closed, others are still waiting for approval. Microsoft announced its intent to purchase Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion in January as well. The Microsoft-ActiBlizz deal is under scrutiny from several regulators though.\nTake-Two Interactive also announced its plan to acquire Zynga for $12.7 billion in January, and the deal closed in May.\nStill, the acquisitions machine rolls on, as plenty more have been announced since January.

          "description": "Lost classic prepares for its prodigal return\nIn just a week's time, a little bit of lost gaming history will be restored, as Square Enix prepares to release its HD remake of the classic '90s RPG Live A Live. The publisher has released one final trailer to stoke the hype fires ahead of the adventure's July 22 launch date.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_F_izc7nlnU\nDirected by Square Enix veteran Takashi Takita, and released to the Super Famicom platform in 1994, Live A Live was an incredibly ambitious title that attempted to tell the intertwining tales of eight distinct characters, with each tale featuring its own bespoke mechanics, tone, and maps — married together by a grid-based battle system and an umbrella arc involving the very fate of time itself. Despite its ahead-of-its-time and hugely lofty concepts, Live A Live was something of a flop on release, and would thus not receive any official localization outside of Japan.\nSquare Enix's new edition of Live A Live is being developed by studio Historia, which has meticulously recreated the original Super Famicom adventure with new \"2D HD\" visuals. In addition, the original 16-bit score — beautifully composed by industry veteran Yoko Shimomura — has been rearranged and rerecorded for the new release. The Live A Live remake will offer RPG fans worldwide their first official opportunity to check out this lost piece of experimental game design. Born out of time and flying under the radar, perhaps this new release will afford this forgotten release the opportunity to earn the legacy that has evaded it for three decades.\nLive A Live launches on Nintendo Switch July 22. You can download a demo from the eShop today.\nThe post Live A Live releases final trailer ahead of next week’s launch appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's now owned by the New York Times, and the Times is partnering with Hasbro now to make a Wordle board game.\nCNN reports that the New York Times and Hasbro are collaborating on Wordle: The Party Game, a board game adaptation of the online version.\nIn the board game version, players compete with each other to guess words the other players have scribbled. Rather than guessing the word solo against the computer, you're trying to guess the other team's chosen five-letter word. It's kind of like Mastermind or Battleship, but with words.\n\nThere are a few different game types out of the box, including a \"fast mode\" that involves a clock and team variations. I also dig the dry-erase boards and markers, so it's easy to just re-use the same board over and over again.\nWordle: The Party Game is currently live for pre-order on Amazon, the Hasbro site, and soon on Target. The board game goes for $19.99 and will ship on October 1, 2022.\nGuess the secret phrase\nWhile strange, it isn't all too surprising. Board games are increasingly popular as of late, and board game adaptations are no different. Look at how many video games have been turned into tabletop versions over the years.\nWith the popularity of Wordle, I imagine a Worlde board game will absolutely sell like hotcakes.

          "description": "TennoCon is Digital Extremes' annual Warframe event that unites fans and usually gives them plenty to cheer about in terms of game announcements. That was certainly the case today; this year's TennoCon livestream delivered a new Warframe expansion called The Duviri Paradox, which was only outdone by Digital Extremes announcing its next flagship game. The studio revealed it has begun development on a fantasy game called Soulframe.\nFew details for Soulframe were given, but you can take your first look at the art direction and vibe in the trailer above. You can also go to the studio's official website to solve a puzzle to see additional concept art and screens.\nWarframe has long been one of the most successful free-to-play games out there, almost coming on a decade since release. You can take a look at what is coming next to this wild sci-fi expeirence in the trailer below.",

          "description": "Whether it's because of its gorgeous visuals, deeply disturbing sci-fi monstrosities, or the return of Glen Schofield, The Callisto Protocol has become one of the most anticipated games of 2022. But where did this new twisted tale come from? Join us as we sit down with the horror master himself to discuss the origins of developer Striking Distance Studios' first game and show off some brand new gameplay as well!\n\n\nMarcus Stewart and Alex Stadnik are here to grill Glen on the title's origins. A few years after his departure from Activision, the CEO, and founder of Striking Distance Studios found himself in the desert, painting and trying to figure out what the next step in his career would be. That led him to Callisto and his brand new studio. But how long did it take him to form the story structure? Did he always know how the game would end? You'll just have to watch the video to find out.\nOn top of the Callisto origin story, we're also showing off some brand new gameplay. Protagonist Jacob Lee traverses the harrowing hallways of Jupiter's dead moon, fending off the terrifying Biophage at every step. We also get a fresh look at the satisfying and devastating shotgun and how it tears through those who would do you harm.\nIf you want to learn more about The Callisto Protocol ahead of its December 2 release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, be sure to head over to our exclusive cover hub below, where you'll find our preview impressions, the GI cover reveal, and more looks at the game. If that's not enough, you can head over to our Rapid-Fire interview with Glen where he quickly details more about the game, his horror influences, and comments on a particular fan theory.

Part of that process involves introducing a skill tree, the first of its kind within the franchise. Sonic has long had adventures that involve him unlocking new abilities, but by introducing a full skill tree in Frontiers, Sonic Team hopes to further enhance what it claims will be the longest mainline game in franchise history.\n\"Combat with enemies is an important part of Sonic Frontiers,\" Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka says. \"Starting out with Sonic at full power would make the combat simple and repetitive, so we made it so the player gradually unlocks Sonic's abilities through the skill tree.

A lengthy update video divulged a number of details, including an idea of how monetization will look and why developer Full Circle chose to go the FTP route. \nFull Circle creative director Cuz Parry explains the decision to go FTP stems from the team’s desire for players across all platforms and budgets to easily access its upcoming skateboarding simulator. It also wants to keep the community together, citing how DLC in previous Skate titles splintered the player base. To that end, Skate will support cross-play and cross-progression across consoles, PC, and mobile. \nAs a FTP game, Skate will have microtransactions, but the team wants …",

Online play supports cross-play and features rollback netcode. The beta will include eight maps, a variety of gameplay modes, and the same roster of characters playable during the alpha with one big addition: the Iron Giant.\nThe peace-loving robot from the (criminally underrated) titular animated film joins the fray, and a new trailer provides glimpses of him in action. \n\n\nWe still don’t know when MultiVersus will launch in full, but we’ve been mostly impressed with it so far.

The studio describes the untitled project as a single-player “immersive action horror game,” and it’s being made for PC, console, and VR. The game's website states that it's developed using Unreal Engine 5 and has an original story that takes place between Alien and Aliens \"where a battle hardened veteran has a vendetta against the Xenomorphs.\"\nThere’s no trailer or screenshots, but Survios says we’ll learn more about the game on July 21 during San Diego Comic-Con at the “Alien: Expanding a Dark and Frightening Universe” panel.\nThis project is unrelated to Aliens: Dark Descent, the Aliens tactical shooter, announced during Summer Game Fest last month. Survios is hiring for positions on the title, suggesting it’s still very early in development. As such, it has no release window, but hopefully, we’ll get a better idea of what it entails during Comic-Con.",

Users also subscribed to PlayStation Plus gain the added benefit of automatically earning loyalty points for making purchases.\nLoyalty points can also be spent on “digital collectibles.\" Examples described in the post are digital figurines of game characters or old PlayStation devices. These collectibles will evidently come in various rarities, with Chen stating players will always have “ultra rare” collectibles to chase. \nThese collectibles may sound like NFTs, but they’re not.

          "description": "In a move that feels more overdue than surprising, Nintendo acquired animation studio Dynamo Pictures and renamed it Nintendo Pictures. The purchased studio will focus on developing visual content for Nintendo's various IPs. \nAccording to Eurogamer, it's unusual for Nintendo to acquire companies despite its recent SRD and Next-Level Games deals. Moreover, Nintendo Pictures' – Dynamo was a production company behind several animated Pikmin shorts – work will be separate from Illumination, the animation studio behind the upcoming Super Mario Bros. Movie. Official documentation of the purchase states: \n\"Nintendo has decided to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares (excluding treasury shares) of Dynamo Pictures and make it a wholly owned subsidiary to strengthen the planning and production structure of visual content in the Nintendo group. The Acquisition is expected to close on October 3, 2022…[and] will have only a minor effect on Nintendo's results for this fiscal year.\"\nWhat animated Nintendo projects are you looking forward to?

The game was set to arrive in February before being delayed and has been playable through various technical tests. \nFirst announced during The Game Awards 2021, Rumbleverse is a free-to-play battle royale where players duke it out by brawling instead of shooting.

Players can even climb up structures to face off on rooftops and leap between buildings. Rumbleverse supports cross-play and cross-progression between consoles and PC. \n\n\nRumbleverse launches on August 11 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via The Epic Games Store.

While certain games like Shadow the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog (2006), Sonic and the Black Knight, and Sonic Forces have experimented with new combat mechanics for the games' protagonists to use, Sonic Frontiers looks to evolve that gameplay component in unprecedented ways.\nWhen Sonic Team set out to create Sonic Frontiers, it wanted to give players more freedom with which to operate. It did this by introducing a new open-zone concept, where players are able to run through and explore various biomes without a predefined path to guide their gameplay.

We knew that the action romp would come exclusively to Switch this year, but today Nintendo announced an October 28 release date with an appropriately over-the-top trailer. \n\n\nPlatinum Games' enemy and hero designs for the franchise remain stunning. Bayonetta sports butterfly wings and tentacled horns in some action sequences, while enemies take the form of armored animals – homunculi, artificial bioweapons. You'll fire canons from a moving train in a ravaged cityscape, ride grotesque crabs up skyscrapers, and even play as the new katana-wielding witch-in-training, Viola. And let's not forget that you can summon an all-powerful kaiju too. It's all wild and nonsensical as you'd expect but in the best possible way. \n\nBayonetta 3 ups the ante on Switch this October 28. A Trinity Masquerade Edition of the game will also be available, boasting a 200-page art book. More details for the special version of the game will be revealed later.",

What alarmed owners of the game was a notice by Ubisoft implying that those who purchased it would still lose access in September. Ubisoft has clarified that will not be the case.\nFor context, Ubisoft recently announced it will cease online services for several of its titles on September 1, of which Liberation HD is among them. In particular, the PC versions of these titles will not only lose their online features but their DLC will be rendered inaccessible, even if you purchased it. \nYesterday, Twitter user Nors3 shared a screen capture of Liberation HD’s now-defunct Steam page, displaying a notice that states, \"At the request of the pub…",

Eurogamer asks if this could be the long-awaited Titanfall 3 in disguise, but that remains to be seen since the posts don't mention anything about the wall-running, mech warfare FPS.\nReferred to as \"Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title,\" a Senior Environment Artist post states:\nA single-player FPS is not often announced, especially since the genre is synonymous with competitive play. A story-centric Apex Legends experience could focus on any number of the frontiers' eccentric personalities. It could even delve into Blisk's notorious Apex Predator squadron. In any case, the upcoming shooter would be in good company, seeing as its predecessor is still the best battle royale out right now.\nWhat do you make of this Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title?

Peter Weller, the actor who became Robocop in the feature film, is reprising his role, bringing both his likeness and voice to this iconic '80s character.\nThe trailer above shows off roughly one minute of gameplay. Robocop's precision targeting is on display, as is his brute strength, which he uses to effortlessly push dumpsters and hurl enemies through the air. Rogue City tells a new story set around the same time as Paul Verhoeven's movie and somehow brings the powerful reboot ED-209 back into the mix.\nTeyon is the development house that released Terminator: Resistance. which recently was enhanced for new-gen machines.

According to information coming from Japan, Takahashi was found floating in shallow waters on the coast of Nago City on the Island of Okinawa by the country’s Coast Guard yesterday, July 6. He was wearing snorkeling gear when found by the Coast Guard. Both the Coast Guard and local police are investigating his death. \nTakahashi’s manga career began in 1982, but it didn’t truly take off until the release of Yu-Gi-Oh! in 1996. In between his start and Yu-Gi-Oh!, though, Takahashi published titles like Fighting Hawk and Tennenshoku Danji Buray, according to Kotaku. After Yu-Gi-Oh! hit shelves in 1996, the series only continued to grow in popularity, spawning a real-life card game in 1999 (that’s still extremely popular today) as well as multiple anime series. Today, the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise spans not just manga, card games, and anime, but video games as well, like this year’s Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel. \n[Source: NHK via IGN]\nThe staff at Game Informer extends their condolences to Takahashi’s family.",

Here’s what the official site has to say on the matter: \nThe Matrix Awakens was first announced and made available on the same night during the 2021 Game Awards. The Unreal Engine 5-powered demonstration from Epic Games stars Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss, who introduces the impressive graphics engine and how close to real-life its visuals can look. Awakens includes an on-rails car shootout throughout a city that often looks like it was ripped from the silver screen despite being rendered on the spot. The demo then lets you roam the massive pre-populated city and change things like time of day or traffic congestion to flex what UE5 is capable of. It’s a terrific showcase for the future of games, so if you haven’t given it a download yet, you’ll want to check it out before the delisting on Saturday.\nYou can watch us tour The Matrix Awakens in this episode of New Gameplay Today.",

          "description": "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is one of the most popular open-world fantasy RPGs ever made for several reasons, including its in-universe card game, Gwent. \nCD Projekt Red, the studio behind Wild Hunt and 2020’s Cyberpunk 2077, has already created a game based on Gwent, aptly called Gwent: The Witcher Card Game, but it seems the developer is not ready to leave that in-universe game behind just yet. That’s because the studio is launching Gwent: Rogue Mage, a new single-player roguelike deckbuilder, tomorrow. \nAnnounced by IGN, Gwent: Rogue Mage launches tomorrow, July 7, on PC, iOS, and Android. IGN reports that this game is what Project Golden Nekker, which the team revealed earlier this year, has turned into, and CD Projekt Red is marketing it as a single-player expansion to Gwent: The Witcher Card Game. However, you won’t need to own that because Rogue Mage is standalone. You can purchase the standalone version for $9.99 or the premium edition, which includes in-game skins and cosmetics, and card packs for the multiplayer portion of Gwent, for $19.99. \n“Rogue Mage came out of us noticing that years after The Witcher 3’s release, there are a significant number of players who want a more PvE experience from Gwent,” game director Vladimir Tortsov told IGN. “While Gwent multiplayer is a fantastic game for those who are looking for a great PvP multiplayer experience, we perfectly understand that many Witcher players loved the original mini-game of Gwent for totally different reasons. With Rogue Mage, we aim to give this audience a reason to play modern-day Gwent in the format they prefer.” \nIGN has an exclusive preview of Gwent: Rogue Mage after going hands-on with it ahead of tomorrow’s release, and if you’re looking for even more details about it, including what this single-player deckbuilder roguelike’s gameplay is like, be sure to check it out. \n[Source: IGN]\nAre you excited to check out Gwent: Rogue Mage?

It describes the delay as a “strategic decision” and that we’ll learn more about the game in the near future. \nForspoken is no stranger to delays, as it was originally slated to arrive on May 24 before getting pushed to October 11. Though this second delay isn’t as long, it’s disappointing that we won’t get to experience Frey Holland’s adventure this year, but we trust that the delay will only help get the game up to snuff. The adventure drops Frey, a modern-day New Yorker, in the fantasy world of Athia where she acquires magical powers and a sentient talking bracelet. She’ll use her newfound abilities to free Athia from tyranny while also searching for a way back to her world. \nForspoken graced Game Informer’s cover in March, and you can catch up on a month’s worth of exclusive features and videos here.",
