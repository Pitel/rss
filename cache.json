Available on the Wii, 3DS, and Wii U, the Virtual Console was effectively a line of purchasable retro games available via the Wii Shop Channel and eShop.\nUnlike Nintendo Switch Online, which offers up a range of playable games for an annual or monthly cost, Virtual Console allowed you pay for games ad-hoc, enabling you to download whichever title you wanted and keep it indefinitely. While we certainly love what Nintendo has been doing with Switch Online over the years, it's no secret that lots of fans would rather the firm revert back to the Virtual Console model.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "There's something uncanny about dipping \"classic\" games in a tub of HD paint for the purposes of a remaster. A reboot can completely reinvent an old character, intriguing players in the same way an adaptation of Macbeth might excite a theatre dweeb. But remasters often feel like someone has plainly yet painstakingly rolled over every inch of the original with linoleum. The worst remasters bring to mind the Spanish pensioner who butchered a fresco of Jesus Christ. As acts of restoration go, Aspyr's work on Tomb Raider (and Soul Reaver) isn't quite that egregious. Hard work has gone into updating the scenery and textures. Basic vine sprites become handsome twirls of plantlife. Egyptian reliefs are given form. But there's a limit to this unfurling of digital lino. The results ultimately evoke the look common in mobile games when smartphones were becoming ever more powerful. This is Lara Croft if she were designed by Gameloft in 2011.\nRead more",

We've all played it, and we all have mildly different opinions on it - the stuff that thrilling conversations are made of. Onward!\nNic: James did you work out how to freeze things yet?\nJames: I’ll explain this quickly so Nic can get on to complaining about Avowed having the wrong kinds of boxes. But yes, I did get stuck on an early main quest that required me to use ice magic to create frozen platforms for crossing water, an otherwise neat little systems thingy that had not been communicated or hinted at before that point, but was communicated and hinted at during the following main quest.\nOtherwise, I’m having an okayish time? It doesn’t have the Skyrim-tier expansiveness I always hope for with these kinds of games, but its world is a pretty one, and it’s got some quality close-quarters mageing.\nNic: Look. I feel passionately about those crates. There are two types of crates. You can only smash the crates that have the special 'smash me' icon on them. I don't want a crate to \"come hither\" me. Takes all the fun out of the petty vandalism.\nIt's funny though because those two qualities you mention, James - the world and magic - are the same ones I thought were Avowed's strongest elements.

I'd run through all the ways Obsidian's latest didn't quite do it for me, most of you would go play it anyway because it's on Games Pass, and we'd all go back to patiently waiting for the sun to explode.\nBut, god, what a devastatingly gorgeous open-zoned world this is. What a triumphantly weird, sprawling playground of fantasy naturalia. What a treat it is to just climb all over, its design ethos captured in the first magical ring I found offering a 15% buff to parkour speed.\nIgnore two thirds of the weapons and just roll a wizard to witness the stodgy melee combat of other classes give way to crackling, cackling spell-slinging. There is such a gulf of quality here it's like playing two different games. I spent 27 hours having a meh ol' time until a reinstallation of Nvidia's loathsome app deleted 200 some screenshots and I had to restart. Why not play a wizard? I thought. Why not indeed.

Kotick made the comments during an appearance on Grit, a business podcast by American venture capital company Kleiner Perkins. He appeared on the podcast with former EA CEO Bing Gordon (thanks, Gamespot), to talk about both their company histories.\nKotick's statements reference widely reported incidents alleging a company culture of harassment, intimidation, and pay inequity around the time - coinciding with a lawsuit against the company - and the petition referred to appears to be this one to remove him as CEO, which attracted over a thousand signatures.\nThat petition followed a report by the Wall Street Journal (paywalled) that highlighted several alleged incidents of harassment by Activision staff, alongside reports that Kotick was aware of these allegations but did not inform the company's board of directors, and intervened to prevent the firing of an alleged harasser. It wasn't just Activision workers who found these claims alarming: a group of company shareholders called for Kotick's resignation soon after. Kotick denied any wrongdoing.\nRead more",

You'll be shuffling over a Commodore 64-tified overworld map, grabbing treasure, bumping foes that move when you do, and turn-based autobattling them.\nGot wounded? Maybe have a nice rest at that campfire. Not too long, you slovenly wastrel! You're actually on the clock: the 'he' of the title refers to the menagerie of boss creatures that turn up after a set time.

There’s also a standalone benchmark tool that you can download from the game’s Steam page, so you can see for yourself how the beast-biffing RPG will run on your hardware.\nIn theory, these are great developments. Lower requirements mean a more widely accessible game, and the benchmark tool – which covers a good six minutes of combined cinematics and simulated free roaming – brings reassurance and accountability to this otherwise hype-reliant prerelease period. Sadly, there are two problems. One, the benchmark confirms outright that Monster Hunter Wilds will run like stagnant goulash on low-end PCs, and two, it does so to the extent that I’m not sure that the revised minimum specs are even reliable.\nRead more",

Also, a relatively bug-free one. \r\n\n\r\nIn the course of my 51 hours as reviewer, I've encountered only a smattering of more significant technical issues. Firstly, some heavy slowdown while roaming Trosky Castle, the centerpiece of the opening Bohemian Paradise region, which I resolved by quitting and reloading. Secondly, a mildly terrifying moment in a dugout when a wounded soldier I was supposed to be treating struck a T-pose, as though afflicted by lightning early onset arthritis. And thirdly a repeated crash bug which I feel warrants its own article given that, together with Deliverance 2's eccentric saving system, it cost me several hours of progress.\r\n \nRead more",

Thanks, Eurogamer. For first noticing the case, I mean. I'm not blaming Eurogamer for the drone crash. Not this one, anyway.\nThe drone was traced back to Akemann, who has agreed to plead guilty to one count of unsafe operation of an unmanned aircraft. That's a misdemeanour that usually carries up to one year prison time, but he's \"hoping to escape the prison term in exchange for 150 hours of community service in support of wildfire relief and the approximately $65,000 USD it cost to repair the plane,\" write Eurogamer, as part of a plea agreement.\nRead more",

          "description": "There was a moment in gaming history when it looked like all games would succumb to the dullest colours imaginable: brown and grey. Resident Evil 4, Fallout 3, Gears Of War - all bleary examples of a grubby visual style. This peaked in Clive Barker's Jericho, a shooter so desaturated it felt like the colour settings on your monitor were banjaxed. I have heard this called \"the piss filter\" and generally lamented in industry circles. But it was always a puposeful choice, intended to add some grittiness to the world. And there's at least one developer who is reviving \"smeared dirt\" as an art direction. As Time Surrenders is a very brown stealth game that takes a lot of inspiration from Metal Gear Solid V.\nRead more",

It’s a mostly AI-powered technology at a time when mistrust in artificial intelligence, fuelled by underbaked applications and anti-creative policies, is at all-time high – not to mention how the new GeForce GPUs it’s released alongside, the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090, have immediately entered 2020-style stock shortage purgatory.\nHowever, having tried it out in a few different games, I suspect time will prove kinder to DLSS 4 than the RTX 50 series launch has been. It is, in fact, a rather nifty collection of upscaling improvements that can help out older graphics cards as readily as the very newest, while building on DLSS 3’s frame generation tool with Multi Frame Generation (MFG) to send visual smoothness skyrocketing. If you care even the slightest iota for how your PC performs in modern games, DLSS 4 demands your attention.\nHere, then, I’ll break down DLSS 4’s various tricks and components, looking at how they really affect performance – and whether it’s worth upgrading your rig to maximise compatibility with it.\nRead more",

          "description": "Various video game industry professionals have confirmed the passing of Victor Antonov, Half-Life 2's art director and the mastermind behind some of gaming's most harrowing cityscapes.\n\n\nAntonov was born in Bulgaria and later moved to the US, where he received training at the Art Center College of Design in California, which he described as one of the harshest schools in existence. Antonov joined Valve in 2000 as the art director of Half-Life 2 and states that its development process and working with Gabe Newell was the best learning experience he ever had.\n\n\nHalf-Life 2 featured a huge shift to a more realistic neo-steampunk world design from the more gamey hallways of the original Half-Life, and a lot of that was owed to Antonov. He's the architect of the inhospitable City 17, the contrastingly beautiful seascape of Half-Life 2's Lost Coast DLC, and the co-creator of City 17's most iconic element, the Combine Citadel.\n\n\n\n\nMany former colleagues have taken to social media to celebrate the man's fantastic contribution to video games. Dishonored's director, Raphael Colantonio, shared the regret of having never expressed how much admiration he had for Antonov, who was also the architect behind the beautifully dystopian Dunwall.\n\n\n\n\nAfter leaving Valve for Arkane to make Dishonored, Antonov worked as an additional art director for Wolfenstein: The New Order and stayed at Bethesda to serve as a consultant on titles such as Fallout 4, Dishonored 2, DOOM (2016), and Prey.\n\n\n\n\nOn top of his brilliant and visionary contributions to gaming, Viktor Antonov will be remembered by the people he has worked with as a unique and remarkable human being.\n\nThe post Half-Life 2’s City 17 and Dishonored’s Dunwall architect Victor Antonov has died appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Valentine's Event has returned to Blox Fruits, and you can earn Hearts to maximize the amount of rewards you can unlock.\n\n\nHearts represent the main form of currency you can get during the event, which can then be used at the in-game ship. Different items are periodically made available at the shop, and they will all require the event currency to unlock. Let's take a look at how you can earn them to spend on the in-game shop.\n\n\nBest ways to get Hearts in Blox Fruits\n\n\nIt's pretty easy to earn Hearts in the game. To do so, you'll have to defeat NPCs close to your player level. Of course, you can defeat NPCs at any location to earn the resource, but the aim should be to farm it efficiently. For that, go to any endgame spot that has loads of enemies.\n\n\nSecondly, you'll have to defeat NPCs who are within 100 levels of your own. This is the only pointer you need to keep in mind while defeating the enemies. You can also invite your friends to improve your chances of the amount of rewards you get from farming the NPCs.\n\n\nBest ways to spend Hearts in Blox Fruits\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have earned Hearts, you'll be able to spend them in the Event shop. When you open the shop, you'll find different items available for various amounts. This includes a few really valuable items that usually cost more Hearts to get. There are a few event-exclusive items as well, like Heart Shades and Cupid's oat.\n\n\nHere are the locations where you'll find the event shop.\n\n\n\nNear the fountain in Middle Town (First Sea)\n\n\nCafe (Second Sea)\n\n\nInside a building near Castle On The Sea (Third Sea)\n\n\n\nThat's pretty much it all when it comes to gaining Hearts. Make sure to check out our guide on getting all the dojo belts in Blox Fruits.\n\nThe post How to get and use Hearts in Blox Fruits appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The new Ashfall update in Fisch has added some interesting content, which includes solving a puzzle to open the secret Bunker at Birch Clay.\n\n\nThis spot was initially locked in the game, but the Volcano Eruption event has activated it. You can now visit the place and open the Bunker to head inside. To do so, you'll have to find a way to open the door.\n\n\nHow to get to the secret Bunker in Fisch\n\n\nThe first job is to reach the location where the Bunker is located. This part will be a lot easier if you already have a GPS device with you. Just go to the following coordinates, and you'll be at the correct location (XYZ: 1700, 143, -2400). Once you reach the location, you'll come across the white birch tree behind the arch.\n\n\nHere, you'll find the secret Bunker, which you can open by just interacting with it. I am not sure if this was how the developers intended it to work. It seems that the main task is just to locate the Bunker, as you don't have to do anything more. Once you open the door, a dark tunnel will be revealed. Use the tunnel to travel all the way underground.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you head inside, you won't find anything with which you can interact with. It has a couple of lockers on either side of the room. There's a white-colored table as well, and you'll find a couple of photo framers. I believe that this location will be required as part of a future event to some degree, but so far, we don't have a precise idea.\n\n\nOf course, you can complete the Dr. Finneus quest inside the game, which will require you to complete a hard task. Doing so will help you unlock an exclusive in-game title, along with a free boat themed around the Ashfall island.\n\nThe post How to open the secret Bunker in Birch Cay in Fisch appeared first on Destructoid.",

Unlike last week, we have new fish to catch this time around, and to do so, you'll have to travel to Ashfall. This location can be found near the Roslit Bay area, and let's take a look at which new creatures can be caught.\n\n\nComplete Ashfall Bestiary in Fisch\n\n\nHere's the full list of all nine new fish that have been added as part of the new Bestiary. Let's take a look at what time, season, and bait is preferable to catch them from the Ashfall region. The region is relatively easy to reach and find, and it gets simpler if you have the GPS device.\n\n\nFish name\nType\nSeason\nTime\nWeather\nPreferred Bait\n\n\n\n\nAshcloud Archerfish\nLimited\nNone\nNone\nFoggy\nCoal\n\n\nBurnt Betta\nLimted\nNone\nNone\nWindy\nSquid\n\n\nBlistered Eel\nLimited\nNone\nNone\nWindy\nWorm\n\n\nCinder Carp\nLimited\nNone\nNone\nClear\nMinnow\n\n\nLava Lamprey\nLimited\nNone\nNone\nRain\nInsect\n\n\nMolten Minnow\nLimited\nNone\nNone\nClear\nFlakes\n\n\nPyro Catfish\nLimited\nNone\nNone\nClear\nBagel\n\n\nPyro Pike\nLimited\nNone\nNone\nRain\nShrimp\n\n\nScooty Salmon\nLimited\nNone\nNone\nWindy\nSeaweed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAshfall location in Fisch\n\n\nIf you have a GPS, go to the coordinates (XYZ: -1435, 125, 460).

To catch the new creatures, you can choose any spot that's situated in the Ashfall region.\n\n\nIf you are looking to complete other bestiaries in Fisch, make sure to check out our full list for the Atlantis update that happened earlier in January 2025.

          "description": "God of Thunder, the Zelda-esque game, is now ready for public testing!\nPrepare yourself to take on the role of Thor, the god of thunder, as he battles his way through the three part game, facing enemies and challenging environmental puzzles, all to finally face down challenging end bosses, culminating in Loki himself.\nThe implementation in ScummVM is slightly different from the original, in that whilst it has a high score table like the original, you don't have to go through the steps of creating an account and being limited to only a single savegame. Also, unfortunately, the game uses a special music format that will need to be implemented from scratch by someone with experience. So for now, no music playback will occur, though in-game sound effects play back fine.\nTo participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. The game itself is freeware, and can be downloaded from the Adept Software website. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.And please take some screenshots along the way.\nHave you the skill to defeat Loki, or will you be defeated by the cunning enemies, or be stymied figuring out the puzzles. Play, and find out.\n>",
