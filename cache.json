That’s the edutainment promise and it’s more or less what E-Line Media seem to be aiming for with Beyond Blue – but with a cool video game instead of the rock concert. There’s some serious cred borrowed from the BBC, with an “inspired by” name-check for superstar documentary series Blue Planet II. However, Beyond Blue is nowhere near the calibre of that programme. The great power of a game to show and teach has been mostly overlooked in this collection of good but disjointed multimedia assets.\nE-Line Media's latest is a peaceful, third-person ocean exploration game about conducting scientific research into marine life. More than just a game, the package also includes 16 short educational films of around two minutes each, briefly describing related scientific topics. In line with this academic stance, there is no threat or jeopardy in the gameplay, encouraging ruminative observation of the environment and the creatures in it.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Originally released on the NES under the title A Boy and His Blob: Trouble on Blobolonia, it was since re-imagined for the Wii by developer WayForward, dropping the subtitle in the process. As far as reboots go it proved to be incredibly successful, and we even declared it “one of the most beautiful and polished Wii releases”. 12 year later, A Boy and His Blob still holds up in terms of visuals, but with a plethora of incredible puzzle platformers in the years since the gameplay has lost some of its standout sheen.\nThe narrative behind A Boy and His Blob is fairly minimal for the most part. Having escaped the planet Blobolonia, the titular ‘blob’ lands on earth and is greeted by our hero, known only as ‘boy’. The two must then team up to navigate a series of levels and ultimately defeat an evil emperor. As the boy is next to useless when it comes to abilities (no offence, mate), he must utilise the blob to gain access to areas that may otherwise be blocked off. Not only this, but each level contains various enemies that must be either avoided altogether or dispatched by utilising the immediate environment.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

But when he upgraded to a Super NES, he encountered some problems.\nAlastair has dyslexia, to the point where he finds some text almost impossible to read. “I remember playing The Legend of Zelda,” he gives as an example, “but because I'm really dyslexic, I hadn't read the name ‘Zelda’, I just went, ‘Oh, it's the game with the golden cover’.” When he later got Ocarina of Time on the N64, he didn’t realise it was part of the same series until he starting playing.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "The best way to search for Switch deals sure ain't on Switch.\nMost fans would agree that Nintendo’s current eShop for Switch could use some work. Sure, it serves its purpose well from a purely transactional standpoint, but there are some glaring issues at the heart of it. The layout makes it difficult to just casually browse and find interesting new titles. User reviews used to be a feature, until Nintendo decided the eShop was better off without them. Worst of all, there’s no catchy music. The company has never been completely on the ball with its online offerings, but even given the fact that the sheer number of games on the system are bound to create discoverability issues, it would be difficult to argue that its latest iteration of the eShop is also its greatest.\nLuckily for us, that doesn’t mean that digital shoppers have to suffer for the duration of this generation. A fan named Michael Fairley decided to step up where Nintendo won’t and put together an impressively useful site to help Switch owners find the best prices for the games and hardware they want. Deku Deals has become the indisputable gold standard for researching any purchases on Nintendo Switch, so we thought we’d speak with Michael to discuss his site at greater length and pick his brain regarding Nintendo’s own efforts in the digital storefront space.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Morse, the strategy game that teaches you real morse code to win a war, has come a long way since we first wrote about it in 2015. What started out as a free flash game (and a makeshift telegraph key made out of a clothes peg) now has proper 3D graphics and quite possibly the most impressive custom controller setup I've ever seen. When I played the demo at EGX 2021 last month, not only had creator AlexVSCoding made an entire telegraph machine for the occasion, but he'd also managed to source a pair of headphones from the 1930s to really hammer home the idea of being a wartime telegraph operator. \nObviously, you don't need a pair of 90-year-old headphones to enjoy playing Morse. A modern headset will do just as well. You also don't technically need the telegraph machine either, as there's an onscreen button interface you can click with your mouse. But let me tell you, pressing those morse code buttons in-game wasn't half as immersive as tapping out the commands on a proper dedicated machine, and I wish there was some way Morse could give everyone that experience when it finally launches in full.\nRead more",

No matter how much you try and tell me about the sweet satisfaction you feel after finally beating a boss on the 57th attempt, I've come to realise I simply don't have the time or the patience to see it through. I'm not sure I ever will, either. \nIt's the same reason I tend to veer away from a lot of other Soulslike games as well. I never really got on with Dead Cells, for instance, and don't even get me started on Sekiro. But cor, I do also love it when a game proves me wrong.

          "description": "Jurassic World Evolution 2 is, just like its predecessor, a very capable adaptation of cinema’s most beloved dinosaur franchise. From its music, to the quotations scattered on its loading screens, to the great steaming swamp of Jeff Goldblum voice acting, it’s a solid case study in how a studio can get its money’s worth from an expensive license. And at its heart, of course, is a stable of spectacular dinosaurs.\nUsing lessons learned from Planet Zoo’s development, which has more or less filled the time since 2016’s Jurassic World Evolution, Frontier have come back with the most beautiful, the most real dinosaurs ever to trudge and honk their way across a monitor. It’s proper John Hammond, spared-no-expense, sunglasses-off-and-gawp stuff. Which makes it all the more painfully frustrating to realise that they’re trapped, once again, in a seriously wonky management game. \r\n\n \nRead more",

When the rules of a mystery - what the investigator can and cannot do, who and what was where and when - are laid out clearly for the audience, working within those limitations to puzzle out the case (a la any book by Agatha Christie, the who-dun-it queen) becomes irresistible.\r\n\n\nConway: Disappearance At Dahlia View knows exactly what its story, and its protagonist specifically, can and cannot do. Robert Conway can use his decades of experience as a private investigator to look for missing child Charlotte May Morgan, but what he cannot do is leave Dahlia View or get caught by the police. From his wheelchair, Conway surveys his neighbours from the window of his second-floor flat, occasionally venturing down into the quiet courtyard below to infiltrate his neighbour’s homes. Though due to the declines of age or sheer arrogance, he does neither half so subtly as he’d like to think.\r\n\n\r\nWithin these parameters, Conway presents a classic locked room mystery, only the “room” is the neighbourhood of Dahlia View and, unbeknownst to Conway but made known to the audience, this has all happened before.\r\n\n \nRead more",

We’re still digging through a lot of the results right now, but I thought I’d take this opportunity to talk about some of the more general concerns and proposals you mentioned as part of your overall feedback, and how we’re going to be incorporating some of them into our editorial plans going forward. \nRead more",

It doesn't have much to do with From Software’s upcoming action-RPG Elden Ring, but there's one simple lyric in it that perfectly sums up my early hands-on time with the game’s upcoming closed network test: “Caution, I’ll approach you with a business mind / Slight two step as I check the time”.\nFor three days last week, I practically waltzed over to my friend's PS5 (that I, err, 'borrowed', as sadly Elden Ring's closed network test isn't available on PC this time around). If you applied for the CNT and got selected, you'll be able to experience everything I'm about to tell you for yourself starting this Friday, November 12th, until Monday November 15th. But even though my hands-on with Elden Ring was brief, I’m confident that this is Souls taking a step in the right direction. It’s at once new and familiar, but forever exciting.

Forza Horizon 5 is as close to flawless as any racer has ever come.

A festival of driv… OK, yes, you should celebrate by playing it. That’ll do just fine.\nRead more",

          "description": "The immense benefits of the Xbox-Bethesda acquisition continue to trickle down as new IPs (Starfield) and upcoming chapters in revolutionary franchises (Elder Scrolls VI) are being developed for next-gen technology. At E3, we learned that the former will be an Xbox exclusive and Day One Game Pass addition. Information surrounding the next Elder Scrolls title, however, has been much harder to come across. Still, a GQ interview with Xbox’s leading man Phil Spencer unearthed some exciting new details about Bethesda’s flagship video game series. Nothing is confirmed yet, but Phil Spencer envisions Elder Scrolls VI as an Xbox exclusive. \nThis exclusivity would be a groundbreaking decision for the games community and the western RPG scene if cleared. “Starfield, arguably the biggest game of 2022, will be Xbox and PC only,” the GQ article reads. “Spencer says he sees the same for The Elder Scrolls VI.” Spencer himself went on to say that having sole rights to both highly-anticipated Bethesda titles isn’t about “punishing any other platform.” Instead, “In order to be on Xbox, I want us to be able to bring the full complete package of what we have. And that would be true when I think about Elder Scrolls VI. That would be true when I think about any of our franchises.”\nThe Elder Scrolls VI might use the same overhauled engine as Starfield, but its release is still far off. Todd Howard confirmed that the game is still in its “design phase.” This, of course, is a little deflating, considering the first teaser was released three years ago. On the other hand, Starfield drops next year on November 11 for Xbox Series X/S and PC. \nDo you think the Elder Scrolls VI will be an exclusive, or is that simply wishful thinking? Drop your theories in the comments section below!\n[Source: GQ]",

Perhaps an early Christmas present for those that celebrate the holiday, Boba Fett will be added to Fortnite (presumably as a purchasable skin in the Item Shop) on December 24. \nIt’s excellent timing, too, because Disney’s upcoming Disney Plus show about the bounty hunter, The Book of Boba Fett, launches five days later on December 29. \nBoba Fett will be making his arrival on the Island December 24, 2021 at 7pm ET! #DisneyPlusDay pic.twitter.com/cj9iC6WRBZ\nNovember 12, 2021\nAs you can see in the Tweet above, Boba Fett is pictured on a throne with Fennec Shand, who is played by Ming-Na Wen in The Mandalorian, right beside him. It’s unclear if Fennec Shand will be joining the Fortnite roster, and while it would be cool, the actual words that accompany the image in the tweet suggest that just Boba Fett is joining the game. \nOnly time will tell for now – you only have to wait about six more weeks to find out. While waiting for that, check out the first trailer from The Book of Boba Fett and then read about how Dark Phoenix from X-Men is being added to Fortnite. Read about how something from Naruto Shippuden is coming to Fortnite soon after that. Then, check out Game Informer’s list of all the Marvel and DC superheroes and supervillains in Fortnite. \nWill you be picking up Boba Fett in Fortnite next month?

After running down Samus' 2D outings, we’re ready to venture into the world of 3D with Metroid Prime.\nReleased on November 17, 2002 for Nintendo's Gamecube, Metroid Prime is often considered one of the best games of its era. However, to better understand Metroid Prime's influence we first have to go back to the tumultuous founding of Retro Studios. In order to develop Metroid Prime, Retro canceled four other projects, and even then many of its designers almost didn't survive development. In the end, Retro created a total masterpiece that feels ahead of its time. Join us as we talk about Retro's struggles, why Shigeru Miyamoto felt that the morph ball was essential to the formula, and how we almost saw Kraid in 3D. \nJoin hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and special guest, Game Informer's own Blake Hester (@metallicaisrad) for the next hour as we explore Metroid Prime's lore, development history, and lasting impact. \nIf you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

No doubt there's been an impressive amount DualSense controller recharges as well. Along with these impressive stats, Ryan listed off the top ten most played games on PS5 over the past year. Some are less surprising, but a few launch titles managed to stick on the list despite some more popular games. \nFortnite\nCall of Duty: Black Ops Cold War\nFIFA 21\nNBA 2K21\nAssassin’s Creed Valhalla\nDestiny 2\nMLB The Show 21\nMarvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales\nDemon’s Souls\nNBA 2K22\nIt's great to see Miles Morales and Demon's Souls hanging with the heaviest time-sinks like Fortnite and Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, especially since they're day one releases with (mostly) single-player campaigns. \nJim Ryan also takes a moment to highlight other big Sony exclusive games like Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, Returnal, and Deathloop, as well as recent studio acquisitions of Bluepoint Games, Firesprite, Housemarque, and Nixxes. He lays out a glimpse at the future, with megaton releases coming next year and beyond in God of War Ragnarok, Horizon: Forbidden West, and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake. In total, 25 games from Playstation Studios are currently in development for PlayStation 5.\nDespite the availability woes facing PlayStation 5, it's had quite the first year with plenty of current and upcoming reasons to make the upgrade. That is if you're lucky enough to find one in the coming months. \nWhat's your most played games on PS5 this year? Let us know in the comments below!",

Not all of them do that, though – some party games will test the bonds of friends greatly, be it on a Mario Party battlefield, an Overcooked kitchen, or somewhere else entirely.

As a result, all batteries in Playdates set to ship had to be replaced.\n“This quickly turned into a months-long, all-hands-on-deck research stress-ball and we halted production at the factory,” a press release reads. “We made the difficult, expensive call to replace all of our existing batteries with new ones from a totally different battery supplier.” \nPanic says the first batch consisted of 20,000 units, all planned to ship late 2021 (presumably now or soon) but that now, they’ll ship in early 2022. A more precise shipping window was not revealed. If you’ve preordered a Playdate, Panic says your place in line to actually receive the device will not change so long as your preorder remains active. \nFor more about this unique handheld gaming device, check out Game Informer’s breakdown of its price, its first slate of games, and more. The Playdate isn't the only upcoming handheld device to suffer a delay. The release of Valve's Steam Deck was just pushed from this holiday to a February 2022 launch. \nDid you preorder a Playdate?

Hopefully, that reveal will come sooner than later given how close we are to Pete’s arrival. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nSpider-Man joins the fray via the Hero Event “With Great Power”.

Join Matt Miller and Alex Stadnik as they take you on a brief 4K tour of some of the things you can expect from Master Chief's next adventure!\nThere's a ton to unpack here, but we're showing off one of the new base encounters for players to frag their way through in today's video. Throughout Halo Infinite's campaign, you'll have to make your way through Banished strongholds to complete your mission, whether that's saving Spartans and UNSC marines or fighting off some of the game's most treacherous bosses. There's no right way to take on these encounters either – one person may find it advantageous to sneak their way through these structures, while others will want to go in guns-a-blazing (like you'll see in the footage above). \nWhile you're giving the Banished hell, don't forget to look around. In today's gameplay video, we show you the location of a Spartan Core, the game's upgrade currency that will enhance Chief's equipment, such as the Grappleshot. \nWe also get to show off one of the game's newest weapons: the Stalker Rife. It's a Banished weapon that feels like it's in the family of the Covenant Carbine, although this semi-automatic rifle packs more of a punch and is perfect for mid to long-range encounters.\nThis is just the start of the fun for fans eagerly awaiting the December 8 release of Halo Infinite! Join us over the next few weeks at Game Informer as we offload a ton of new information about developer 343's latest entry in the iconic series, including a deeper dive into the campaign, our new impressions of the single-player mode, and so much more!

A cheat can get them that. Really, for a lot of wants and needs in GTA, there’s an accompanying cheat. \nHowever, some of the cheats previously seen in GTA III, GTA: San Andreas, and GTA: Vice City have been cut, according to Rockstar, although the company opted to stay mum on the topic when asked about which ones by USA Today, as reported by Eurogamer. \n“We actually had to remove a couple for technical reasons, certain things that didn’t play well in the Unreal base,” Rockstar Games producer Rich Rosado told USA Today. “But that’s actually where I’ll leave it. There’s some fun with discovery. I’m not saying plus or minus, but I’d rather not just go right on the nose before the release and go straight to the end credits.” \nUSA Today notes that Rosado opted not to reveal which cheats won’t be present. Rosado also opted not to reveal whether or not any new cheats had been added to the trilogy.

Naruto’s fluid animation, impressive world-building, and relatable heroes have inspired fans across the globe. At the same time, Fortnite is beloved for its constant content rollouts and unexpected crossovers, with Marvel and DC being primary sources of inspiration. However, it’s rare for anime to make an appearance in the cartoonish battle royale’s gameplay loop. Yet, somehow it makes sense for two heavyweights like Naruto and Fortnite to come together.

          "description": "Few games shook the industry or even pop culture like Grand Theft Auto III did in 2001. Coming from seemingly nowhere, it quickly grew from cult hit to mainstream sensation. Sure, the GTA series on PlayStation had a reputation for being a vulgar and violent yet captivating sandbox, but the shift to a full 3D Liberty City in GTA3 shattered our perception of immersion possible at the time. Subsequent releases of Vice City and San Andreas built on the mold set by Rockstar, with bigger locations, more vehicles, weapons, activities, and debauchery. As the generations passed and GTA evolved into what we know it to be today with Grand Theft Auto V and GTA Online, the original 3D trilogy became more of a fond memory, left to stay in the past than to be played in their original forms. That is, until today.\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nJoin us for an earlier and extended Game Informer Live at Noon Central on Twitch featuring John Carson and Andrew Reiner. We'll be taking our first look at Rockstar's remastered collection Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition. Featuring new textures, 4K resolution, updated lighting, and controls in line with GTAV, the PlayStation 2 trilogy has a considerable facelift that we're very excited to see and play. The collection is available today digitally on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.\nDon't forget to join us in the exclusive Game Informer Discord server, where subscribers to our Twitch channel can chat it up with the GI editors and become a part of our ever-growing community!

Unfortunately, according to a new Bloomberg report, it’s going to be even more challenging as Sony has reportedly cut its PS5 production numbers target by at least 1 million. The company initially aimed to assemble and manufacture more than 16 million PS5s before the end of March 2022, but that number was trimmed to roughly 15 million. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nBloomberg’s report states that the original 16 million target was named to achieve its sales goal for the period and get a headstart on production for next year. As expected, the reason is “logistics issues and part shortages,” which have grown to be more severe for Sony, according to its chief financial officer Hiroki Totoki in an investors call in October. \nThe PS5 is the first Sony console that reached 10 million units sold the fastest; Sony achieved this milestone in July. Still, Bloomberg reports that the pace has fallen behind due to production issues. Now, the PS5 is lagging behind the PlayStation 4. \nWhile waiting for more PS5s to become available, read about how Nintendo is going through a similar struggle, having cut its Switch production output down by 20% due to production issues. \n[Source: Bloomberg]\nHave you purchased a PS5?

It’s the Texas of video games, and whether you love it or hate it, its bombast cannot be overstated. For better and worse, Battlefield 2042 continues this trend, offering a dizzying amount of on-screen explosions, firefights, and objectives to capture. The game’s 128-player matches and gargantuan maps guarantee dramatic moments – and some of my favorite gaming clips from 2021 – but there’s a thin line separating spectacle and confusion. \nThere’s never been a Battlefield game released without Conquest, the signature mode which tasks two opposing teams to capture and defend objective zones across the map.

Image & Form Games went quiet with The Gunk for about a year before it stepped back into the spotlight (and out of the gunk) during the Xbox Gamescom 2021 stream held in August. There, it was revealed that the Xbox-exclusive title would be released this December. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nNow, we know it’s releasing December 16 thanks to a new blog post from the team. \n“We’re so excited to finally reveal the release date of The Gunk, our highly anticipated Xbox exclusive from the creators of the SteamWorld franchise,” the post reads. “Get stuck into The Gunk on December 16 – for anyone subscribed to Game Pass, it’s launching day and date on the service.” \nAs noted above, The Gunk will be available on launch day for Xbox Game Pass subscribers. When players jump into it, they’ll experience what the Image & Form Games team describes as a “third-person action adventure game about a duo of gritty space haulers, Rani and Becks, struggling to make a buck as they chance upon a mysterious planet laden with a wealth of natural resources.” It’s on that planet that they discover what’s known as the gunk, which is damaging the planet – however, said gunk is worth a lot of money and the duo must determine what’s more important to them.  \nWhile waiting for The Gunk to be released next month, read about this other Image & Form Games title, SteamWorld Headhunter, which was just announced during the Thuderful Games showcase. \nAre you excited for The Gunk?

The company has announced the initial wave of devices that were supposed to ship out in December will now have a targeted February ship date.\nThe delay is due to the global supply chain issues plaguing many businesses heading into the holiday season. Here's Valve's announcement of the shifted timeline and its reasoning why in full:\nIt looks like Steam Deck reservations that were due later will also be affected. Keep an eye on your Steam account if you've pre-ordered one already.\nWhile it's disappointing to have to wait the extra couple of months, two months isn't a lot longer to wait.

          "description": "Spider-Man swings exclusively into the PlayStation versions of Marvel’s Avengers on November 30. Developer Crystal Dynamics finally gave us our first look at the wall-crawler’s design, as well as announcing a trailer set to debut tomorrow, November 11.\nAs you can see in the image above, Spider-Man pretty much looks like Spider-Man. He’s got subtle unique features such as a black grip on the gloves but he doesn’t look much different than his traditional design or what previous alterations have done. We’re not complaining; we’re happy to see Spidey in his familiar glory. \nSpidey joins the fray via the free \"With Great Power\" hero event. Billed as neither an Operation (like Kate Bishop/Hawkeye) or an expansion (like War for Wakanda), it's tough to know how big of an event this will be. The story focuses on Peter Parker uncovering a new threat and joining the Avengers to stop AIM from procuring dangerous, and mysterious, technology. Used to flying solo, Pete struggles with the dynamic of working on a team and we’ll see if he joins the Avengers full time or remains on his own by the end. Crystal Dynamics says the first trailer will premiere via IGN sometime tomorrow. \nFor non-PlayStation players, a big update also launches November 30 that adds a new four-player raid against Klaw, a power cap increase, and the arrival of the loot box-style Shipments. You can read more details about those additions and more here.

He also revealed that this year’s show will focus more on said games (and presumably trailers) and less on featured celebrities and musical performances. \n“You know, it’s great to have celebrities, it’s great to have music, but I think focusing really on games is important,” Keighley said. “Especially this year, there’ll be a lot of content for 2022 and 2023 that will be showing us our kind of biggest lineup yet of world premieres and announcements. What we learned last year was as that end of the day, it really is the games and the trailers that drive the show.” \nKeighley continued and revealed his Game Awards hand a bit, stating that he expects to feature 40 to 50 games “some way or another” this year. He then added that the number of new games announced during the show will probably be in the double digits. \nThe Game Awards as a whole have drawn criticism from some in the gaming community as being more focused on the game announcements and trailers rather than the actual awards handed out, but it seems that in Keighley’s eyes, they’re necessary in order to put on the show itself. \nThis year’s awards show will be held in-person, as opposed to last year’s mostly virtual event due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. They’ll air on Thursday, December 9. \nWhile waiting for the show, check out all of the winners from last year’s Game Awards show and then read about how The Game Awards 2020 broke an impressive viewership record after that.\nAre you excited about this year's show?
