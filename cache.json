But gosh darn it if we don't try our hardest all the same. \nInevitably, though, time does get the better of us sometimes (or, in my case at least, maybe my eyes are just too big for my gaming stomach), and certain games end up slipping further and further down our to-do lists until they eventually fall away entirely. Not through any fault of their own, mind. Just... time. But as a final parting shoutout for 2022, I wanted to memorialise all the games that fell of my personal to-do list this year and say, \"I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN IT, I PROMISE!\" (For real, though, I still want to talk about all of these at some point.

It's a very enigmatic little game, but one that's instantly charming in its old-school vibes and artfully constructed world. Its soundtrack is a bit of a corker, too.\nRead more",

They’re Fallout: A Post-Nuclear Role-Playing Game, Fallout 2, and Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood Of Steel. I already own all three elsewhere, as you might well too, but if you don’t then it’s a good way of picking up three classics of 90s PC gaming.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Often unintentionally, something happens during an event and, if people want, it becomes more than an occurrence, it becomes part of the event. They repeat it, and they share it with other people in their lives and hearts, and the tradition grows. Often the original food/game/gesture/saying/joke/whatever had nothing to do with the event's core, and that doesn't matter. Sometimes it simply brings joy and feels right. For example, the use of 1956 pop song Green Door in free festive indie game Dracula Cha Cha feels so right that to me, it is a Christmas song. Green Door has run through my head for weeks, and it is once again time for the annual go on Dracula Cha Cha.\nRead more",

You play as an alchemist who has set up shop in an old wizard’s hut, ready to sell your many bubbling brews and concoctions to the locals. People will come by the shop during the day banging on about their problems, so you need to listen to each customer's issue, create an appropriate potion to help, and receive a lovely handful of gold in return. It’s essentially a shop management sim, since you make money, buy ingredients, and haggle to get a good deal. But the best part of Potion Craft is all in the title; it's getting to grips with the art of potion brewing.\nRead more",

It’s also a bit of a looker, with some snazzy visual accoutrements such as ray tracing and global illumination.

Seeing as it’s the holidays, Blizzard are charging just a single Overwatch Coin for the skin, which is way, way less than the thousands that legendaries usually cost.

          "description": "I've been playing Blacktail, ostensibly for review, but with all the seasonal nonsense going on I haven't played enough to give you a big wot I think. It's worth writing about though, so here I am, doing that. It's a weirdo little first-person action-adventure game where you play as the 16-year-old Yaga, who has been run into the forest because the local villagers think she's in league with the witch Baba. If you know any European folklore you may have reason to suspect they're right.\nYaga's childhood friends have all vanished, along with her sister, and the game sends you off to breadcrumb trails around a bright, unreal forest, to find the memories of what happened to the unfortunate kiddies. Along the way you grow in power and skill, using different types of arrows with your bow, as well as lures and spells. I like Blacktail because it's a little bit janky in ways that don't break the game, and is absolutely committed to its own particular flavour of odd. It's the kind of game you used to see a lot in the early-mid 00s, and just don't get much anymore.\nRead more",

The reimagined version of the classic Shipment map - introduced with last week’s Season 01 Reloaded midseason update - will be festooned with decorations, along with the bodies of your enemies. COD now has its own Santa, too, and I wouldn’t want to tangle with him.

Alone or with a party of pals, you head into dungeons to mash AI-controlled monsters and fill your pockets with loot. Other players are out there doing the same, and might come to claim your goodies, especially as you're all competing for the limited escape portals that let you keep your shinies.

Having launched into early access in mid-October, the latest game from the Surviving Mars devs has just recently doubled in size to include a brand-new desert biome in its Dunes And Moons update, adding harsh temperature extremes to deal with, new alien lifeforms to observe, and, you know, just the odd Chaos Moon to endure while you're at it. \nThe world of Desertum is certainly a marked change from Stranded's initial mountainous forest planet, Sobrius, but after a few weeks of trying (and inevitably failing) to stay alive in them, I do feel like I've settled on a couple of vital dos and don'ts now. For example, Do: invest in defences early on. Don't: eat that weird alien zebra camel until you know whether it's going to give you gut rot. The list goes on, and has only grown larger with the addition of Desertum, which was deliberately designed to \"challenge players to plan better and not rely on their previous knowledge,\" Dyankov tells me. \"Our aim here has been to find a balance between the familiar and unfamiliar within the Desertum Biome, to ensure it's a challenging place to build your base, but is also enjoyable.\" I'll try to remember that the next time horned dinosaurs are gnawing my survivors' legs off.\nRead more",

You play as the dapper defence attorney Jayjay Falcon who alongside his witty lackey Sparrowson take on four seemingly unrelated cases.

Custom controller maker Super Louis 64’s done just that, crafting a Buster Sword that lets him play through Final Fantasy 7 Remake in true Cloud style.

          "description": "It's not all that easy for an action platformer to stand out, even if it does a lot of things right. I'll talk a bit about how Wavetale does it, but the first one is obvious within a few minutes, because if you're anything like me you'll be ignoring the danger your family is in to slide around with your newfound powers going \"wheeee!\".\nVery quickly, you see, you gain the ability to not just walk on water, but run up a little and you'll start power sliding freely around. Hold the jump button and you even charge up a big boosted power charge. Jump off the land and press sprint and you'll dive, briefly powering through the water before smashing out again. It is delightful.\nRead more",

          "description": "The NZXT H510 Elite is a rather excellent mid-size case, offering beautiful visuals courtesy of its glass-heavy design and an easy build experience thanks to the company's long-ass history of case-building. The H510 Elite also comes with a controller for its integrated RGB lighting, so you can easily plug in other NZXT gubbins for a pretty sweet setup. \nAnyway, why am I bringing this up? Of course, it's because the case is discounted on Amazon US, where it's been reduced to $79.99, exactly 50% off its $159.99 MSRP. Given that the case has been selling for $145 or higher outside of Black Friday, when it dipped to $100, this is a pretty awesome deal! \nRead more",

          "description": "When I previewed High On Life at Gamescom earlier this year, I came away with a little skip in my step. Justin Roiland and Squanch Games might be on to a winner, I thought. The talking alien guns weren't that irritating and the gun fights seemed solid! And it appealed to my juvenile sense of humour too. Poo and wee? Yeah, you'll get a cheap chuckle from me. I understood then that it might not be for everyone, but hey, I can roll with that if the FPS bit is good.\nHaving now spent a few hours with the final game, I've concluded that my mind must've been chemically altered by the doner kebab I consumed the night before. You can switch off your gun's verbal diarrhea through the in-game menu, but what you'll find behind the brown curtain is a very unimaginative shooter. For a world so colourful and zaney, it's a shame the FPS side can't match it.\nRead more",

YA!\nThe wallet-troubling merchandisers over at Good Smile Co. have opened pre-orders on the next gaming superstar joining its enormous range of ridiculously adorable Nendoroid figurines — And this time around, it's a true icon of the medium, with the coming of Street Fighter legend Chun-Li!\n\nAs with all Nendoroid releases, Chun-Li stands a dinky 100mm in height, (that's just under four inches), and comes complete with a stand and several faceplates and accessories — allowing fans to stage The Strongest Woman in The World in all manner of dynamic poses. The additional Faceplates include a business face, a cute smile, and even a tearful expression, though why you'd use that is beyond me. Accessories include alternate hands, a Kikoken fireball, and Chunner's famous Lightning Legs kick!\n\nIf you'd like your own pocket-sized Chun-Li to stand guard over your desk, then you can pre-order her right now over at the official Good Smile Co. store and other toy retailers. Nendoroid Chun-Li retails for ¥8,400, (or roughly $58 USD), not including shipping, handling, or any potential customs charges. Chun-Li is expected to ship in the summer of 2023. Surprisingly, this is only the first of the Street Fighter Nendoroids. Given the huge roster of characters on offer, one would think Good Smile would have tapped this market long before now.\nYA-TA!\nThe post Chun-Li is now The Strongest Nendoroid in The World appeared first on Destructoid.",

Patch 6.3 for Final Fantasy XIV is due to arrive on January 10, 2023, bringing new story and raid content, as well as many other changes and additions.\nThe trailer shown off today during the Live Letter spotlights what the protagonist, or Warrior of Light, will be getting up to as the main story content continues. We see newer addition to the cast Zero a fair bit, but it also looks like Alisae and Alphinaud will be involved too.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVQtvBIdv4Y\nWe also see some of the new raid content coming to Final Fantasy XIV's current 24-player raid series, Myths of the Realm. Seems the gods will continue to test players, and I'm really digging the bits we saw of their arenas.\nHome sweet Island Sanctuary\nOf course, a Final Fantasy XIV patch is a grand affair, and there's much more on the way too. As outlined on the Patch 6.3 site, there are updates to Tataru's Grand Endeavor, additional Duty support, and both a new Unreal Trial and Ultimate Raid. It seems like XIV players who like the high-end content will have their hands full with the new update.\nBut if you prefer a quiet life, in the sanctity of a peaceful island, there's something for you too. The Island Sanctuary is getting an update, which will include a new landmark, and some big quality-of-life changes that Square Enix's Naoki Yoshida outlines during the Live Letter. Picking up all leavings and yields in one fell swoop is going to be a game-changer.\nWhile the holidays may just be getting started, Final Fantasy XIV looks poised to ring in the new year with a big patch. We'll see where the MSQ goes, and maybe head back to our islands for a little maintenance, on January 10, 2023.\nThe post Final Fantasy XIV Patch 6.3 arrives on January 10 appeared first on Destructoid.",

And to celebrate the occasion, Sony Interactive Entertainment and Polyphony Digital released a video message, thanking the community and the team for delivering over two decades of critically acclaimed racing action.\nThe first Gran Turismo launched on PlayStation on December 23, 1997, kicking off a franchise that aimed to bring a sense of realism and technical authenticity to the racing game genre. With the ever-evolving technology of PlayStation hardware, developer Polyphony Digital has been afforded the opportunity to push the envelope further and further, with sequels boasting increasingly photo-realistic visuals and immersive driving physics almost unparalleled in the genre.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zIcBFcLM7U&ab_channel=GRANTURISMOTV\nA lengthy letter from Polyphony Digital CEO Kazunori Yamauchi, released for the anniversary, reflects on the history of the franchise, while also revealing that a staggering 90 million Gran Turismo titles have been sold since the series' debut. Yamauchi speaks of his and the Polyphony team's immense pride in the franchise, noting that the studio still carries a sense of revitalized determination into the current and forthcoming gaming generations.\n\"I can’t ever thank enough the Gran Turismo users and people of the Gran Turismo community who have played our new titles, which at times could be said to have been very experimental, writes Yamauchi. \"We are here today because of all the people who supported us. I believe the Gran Turismo series have always pursued “beauty.” The beauty of the cars, the beauty of the scenery, the beauty of the lighting, the beauty of driving, the beauty of sounds/music and the beauty of the graphics.\"\n\"The “pursuit of beauty” is the motivation for creating Gran Turismo.\"\nThe post Gran Turismo celebrates 90 million sales in 25th Anniversary message appeared first on Destructoid.",

As we see Shaun practicing his very finest ragdoll efforts, he tells us that he has been keeping busy between games — cutting to a montage of Shaun in action, which includes a clip of the controversial GTA VI dev footage, leaked earlier this year.\nWhile this is not the first time the Goat Simulator crew has referenced another developer for satirical fun, Rockstar Games — as billion-dollar companies are wont to do — clearly didn't see the funny side. The ad in question has since been pulled from all official outlets, with even reuploads posted to Twitter and other social media sites by members of the public being shut down as quickly as they appear.\nRockstar Games is still shining from the theft and broadcast of the (clearly very, very early) development footage. The videos were allegedly stolen in September directly from the company's own Slack channels by a 17-year-old hacker, who, is it also claimed, had planned to extort the publisher, but instead found himself in the bad books and black vans of the feds. The suspect is expected to appear in a high court at a later date.\nGoat Simulator 3, which does not feature any GTA VI source code , (that we know of) is available now on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.\nThe post Goat Simulator 3 ad pulled for including leaked GTA VI footage appeared first on Destructoid.",

Now available on all platforms, the update adds a variety of fun modes and features to the retro scrapper.\nFirst and foremost, the new Custom Game mode allows hosts to tweak a variety on in-game options in order to fine-tune their Shredder-smashing experience. Players can now take on fast enemies, play as the same characters, turn up the difficulty, switch out health for supers, and even access infinite credits for shellfish ease. It should be noted that turning on any of these extra options rules out leaderboard access, or the unlocking of achievements.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GemOAwU-9fo&ab_channel=Dotemu\nAdditionally, some fun new filters have been made available, allowing for players to give the screen the curved, pixelated look of an arcade monitor, or a '90s-tastic, bleeding-color style of a VCR tape. Radical. In regards to online play, a new option will allow the host to dictate the amount of players allowed to join a game, from two to four. Guest players can also rejoin previously left games.\nImportantly, the new update brings a host of tweaks, balance changes, and bug fixes to Shredder's Revenge. While many were happy to praise the game for its authentic retro style and attention to detail, many critics and fans have papered over the litany of bugs that ruin an otherwise great experience. Fortunately, this new patch addresses a variety of problems — from random crashes and vanishing bosses, to broken scores and input glitches. Additionally, a small selection of player and enemy moves have been buffed/nerfed, in order to provide a tighter, fairer experience.\nTMNT: Shredder's Revenge is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge update adds custom options, filters, and more appeared first on Destructoid.",

The 2018 reboot of God of War also got a New Game Plus mode down the line, so we can extrapolate a bit from that. The previous God of War's NG+ included a difficulty option, a handful of new armor sets and abilities, and some new attack patterns for enemies.

Nintendo also dropped a Mario-themed 2023 desktop calendar, inline with previous years.\nThe notebook clocks in at 64 pages, and has \"illustrations of characters from the game, and eight pages for composing music.\" For 400 Platinum, it's one of the fancier notebooks Nintendo has offered on the service to date.\n[gallery columns=\"4\" size=\"medium\" ids=\"355550,355551,355552,355553\"]\nHere's a full recap of everything that arrived on My Nintendo on December 22, 2022, as well as direct links to the merch:\nEarthBound Beginnings: Eight Melodies Notebook (400 Platinum Points)\nEarthBound Beginnings: Phase Distorter Luggage Tag (400 Platinum Points)\nKirby's Dream Buffet Keychain (600 Platinum Points)\nMy Nintendo 2023 Desktop Calendar (400 Platinum Points)\nIf you need more My Nintendo Platinum Points now, we have you covered:\nAs a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop.

          "description": "Just the classics\nToday's Epic Games Store giveaway is here for a limited time, and it's some post-apocalyptic goodness. The original Fallout, as well as its sequel Fallout 2 and Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel are free on Epic, today through December 23.\nIt's all part of Epic's holiday game giveaway, which has seen some solid games go up for free on the store. Every day, Epic's been rolling out some new free games to give out for the holiday season, ranging from Lego Builder's Journey to Bloons TD 6. The 15 Days of free games, running from December 15 through 29, now adds Fallout to the mix.\nFallout and its sequel are easily western RPG classics. While the series has made the jump to 3D, these isometric games hail from the era of PC RPGs with overhead views and immense malleability. They're also fantastic, and well-worth looking into if you're only familiar with the more recent titles.\nBethesda actually held a special retrospective event earlier this year, commemorating the series and detailing its history as part of its 25th anniversary. You can find one of the earlier episodes, all about the creation of Fallout, in the video below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKEQz-h2j6Y\nA nuclear winter wonderland\nIf you're an Xbox Game Pass subscriber, you already have access to these games. So for those already using the service, today's freebie might not seem like much. However, I'll argue two points: it's a free game, and one that gets added to a separate library. Having a game license in a few places for the low, low price of free isn't really a bad thing.\nAnd hey, maybe today's freebie is just a push for everyone to pick up and play some Fallout this holiday season. With Starfield set for 2023 and The Elder Scrolls next up on Bethesda's docket, it seems like we'll be waiting a bit for the next Fallout entry anyways.\nThe post Fallout, Fallout 2, and Tactics are today’s Epic Games Store freebies appeared first on Destructoid.",

Although the Elden Ring beta showed me that future was possible, few could predict just how ubiquitous the From Software juggernaut would become.\nAfter launch, I looked around and basically everyone I knew was playing it. My wife, who only plays action adventure games once every few years, was — and still is — into it. All of her office co-workers were playing it, and several folks who had never Platinumed anything in their lives were going for a full clear.

All three games will be available at a \"suggested retail price of $60.45,\" and there's also going to be a \"complete the set\" offer, so you can \"only pay for and receive items that you don't already own.\"\nThis offer is live today, and will run through January 2, 2023 (specifically, 9:59 AM PT on that day). The concise phrasing used for this bundle is that they include the \"base games,\" so keep that in mind.\nAll of these games are well reviewed\nTruth be told this is a pretty great bundle: one of the best I've seen in a long time. It not only involves a newish well received Marvel strategy game, but a good chunk of modern classic gameplay via XCOM. If you pick these up, they'll likely last you the entire rest of the month, as you can really dig into them almost indefinitely. Plus, I've replayed XCOM 2 many times since it was released years back, so for most people already invested in the strategy genre, it'll pay dividends down the line.\nYou can check out our own reviews of each core game here!\nMarvel's Midnight Suns\nXCOM 2\nThe post PSA: You can get Marvel’s Midnight Suns and XCOM 2/Enemy Unknown in a real cheap bundle for a limited time appeared first on Destructoid.",

You can find it here for 600 Platinum Points.]\nA My Nintendo Kirby keychain is in the pipeline and will come out in the near future, a new My Nintendo post has revealed.\nIn typical my Nintendo fashion it's only done in passing on a post about the greater Kirby franchise, but we do know the design (pictured here) and that it'll be celebrating Kirby's Dream Buffet. Typically, this means that the reward is roughly a week out. While there are no keychains currently for sale, they've ranged from 400 to 800 Platinum Points in the past.\nIf you don't want to wait, there's a printable (digital file) pop-up card for Kirby's Dream Buffet that you can get now. It'll cost you 30 Platinum Points. Nintendo also reminds everyone that the recent Kirby 30th anniversary concert is now online, and there's a Dream Buffet wallpaper reward available.\nAs a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop.

Additionally, a variety of additional dip switch and option settings have been applied to several titles, while new tips have been added to the in-game strategy guides.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6wScwqY440&ab_channel=Destructoid\nIn regard to online connectivity, TMNT IV: Turtles in Time now supports online multiplayer, while a future update will add the same feature to TMNT III: The Manhatten Project. Across the board, improvements have been made to all games' online stability, while players can setup up lobbies for the two arcade releases, limiting them to two-to-four players as desired.

          "description": "Today's Season 5 update is also its last major one\nMajor support for Chocobo GP is coming to an end. Today, Square Enix confirms that there won't be any further large-scale updates to Chocobo GP after the Season 5 update that goes live today, December 21.\nWhat it means by \"large-scale\" is that major additions, like new characters or maps, will not be arriving in any further updates. Season 5 will also be the last season where prize pass levels are used in the special Chocobo GP mode. The GP mode will still be playable and rankings will continue, without the use of prize pass levels, in the same manner as the current season off period.\nSales of Mythril, a currency for the shop, have also been discontinued on the Nintendo eShop. Players who have Mythril can still spend it, up until the shop disappears on January 6, 2023. The currency is not refundable either.\nNew items will continue to be added to the shop during the course of Season 5, but the same items may also go into the ticket or gil shops, making them available without Mythril. Items originally added to the Mythril shop during Seasons 1 through 4 \"may\" also be added to the ticket or gil shops, per Square Enix's announcement.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY9weUmUw_0\nHitting the brakes\nThis effectively means Chocobo GP is hitting the brakes on its online support. New characters and maps are coming to a close, the premium currency shop is closing, and it sounds like Season 5 will be the last major one.\nIt's a bummer to see. Chocobo GP didn't receive the warmest reception, but my fond memories of Chocobo Racing had me hoping this one would turn things around a bit over time. It looks like that's not the case, as the game's ending major support within the same calendar year as its launch.\nThe post Chocobo GP won’t be getting any more large-scale updates appeared first on Destructoid.",

Fans were excited about the sequel for several reasons – that original reveal trailer was great – but the question on many minds was this: Why is Dead Island 2 set somewhere that’s not an island? \nI traveled to Nottingham, England to visit Dambuster Studios, and this was one of the first questions I asked. Unsurprisingly, considering this is the team that's been developing this game since 2018, lead narrative designer Khan had an in-depth answer. \nSimply put, Los Angeles has become an island, metaphorically speaking. \nDead Island 2 begins in the final days of the evacuation of LA after the zombie outbreak has swept through…",

The surprise launch comes a month and a half after the developer gave us a December 2022 release window for the long-awaited follow up to its 2017 smash hit, Golf Story.\nGolf Story provided players a retro-styled RPG with a zany story centered around golf of all kinds: regular, disc, and more. Sports Story sees SideBar Games expand the formula to include various other athletic events, including BMX, tennis, cricket, soccer, volleyball, fishing, and more. If you loved the golf of Golf Story, don't worry: That sport carries over to Sports Story, bringing with it eight unique golf courses. \nYou can see the full video, which also provides updates for Sea of Stars, Undying, and Dust & Neon, below.\n\n\nGolf Story, SideBar Games' predecessor to Sports Story, arrived on Switch on September 28, 2017. In our review, we called it \"a breath of fresh air for sports, and another fun story to follow for role-playing fanatics,\" awarding it a 9 out of 10. Sports Story was initially announced by SideBar Games in December 2019, with long stretches of silence from the development team. Then, during last month's Indie World Showcase from Nintendo, the developers finally announced that the game would arrive at some point in December 2022.\nSports Story is available now for Switch.",

As for what to expect, though, that remains unknown – Santa Monica Studio says it'll \"share more details once we get closer to the release.\" \n\n\nWhile many had hoped Ragnarök would launch with a New Game Plus mode built-in, its arrival after the game's release isn't surprising.

In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch today at 3 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. \nEpisode 1 - The Harry Mason Shuffle\nEpisode 2- When Doves Cry\nEpisode 3 - Bible.\nEpisode 4 - Age Seven, Short, Black Hair\n\n\nIn 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

          "description": "2013’s Risk of Rain is getting an enhanced remake, and it’s coming next year to celebrate its 10th birthday. Titled Risk of Rain Returns, it spruces up the original with improved art, new survivors, and more.\nAnnounced during Nintendo’s House of Indies: Holiday Event Day 2 today, Risk of Rain Returns expands upon the first game while applying the lessons and improvements of Risk of Rain 2. Although Returns does not adopt the sequel's 3D art direction, it features new HD pixel art, balancing tweaks, and new music tracks from composer Chris Christodoulou. It also has improved multiplayer, with other content updates to be shared in the future. Check out the animated announcement trailer below. \n\n\nIn a press release, Hopoo Games co-founder Duncan Drummond says that, “As we chart our future as developers, it was important to us that we look back on our early work. Risk of Rain Returns is a small token of our appreciation to this incredible community. We hope everyone is as excited about the future as we are.” While still developed by Hopoo, Risk of Rain Returns will be published by Gearbox. \nRisk of Rain Returns will be available on Switch and PC.

That's why I went to Nottingham, England, to go hands-on with the game for more than seven hours. And soon, you can read everything I learned because Dead Island 2 bloodies up this month's cover of Game Informer. \nGame Informer video editor Alex Van Aken and I visited Dambuster Studios in Nottingham to play two extensive portions of Dead Island 2, talk with the game's director about its development and why the team started with a blank slate, learn from the narrative lead about why a game with \"island\" in its name is set in…",

Now that he’s reached the top of the mountain, the series is giving the perpetually young hero his last hurrah before kicking off a fresh adventure starring a new cast of characters.\n\n\nThe Pokémon Company announced that beginning January 13 (in Japan), Ash and Pikachu’s final chapter begins. It consists of 11 special episodes serving as a grand send-off celebrating the duo's achievements. It also features some familiar faces from Ash’s past, including Misty and Brock.\nSometime later in the year, a new yet-to-be-titled animated series set in Scarlet/Violet’s Paldea region kicks offs. It stars two young trainers, Liko and Roy, joined by the three starters of that region: Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly. The trailer also teases the appearance of a shiny Rayquaza.\nSo this is it. If you spent your childhood following Ash's exploits or have stuck with him for his entire run, how does it feel to finally see the character get his flowers and ride off into the sunset?

And you can do so the day you bring home your PSVR2 system. \n\n\n\"A deeper and more captivating adventure awaits with PlayStation VR2, as Ethan Winters' journey takes full advantage of the headset's advanced features,\" a press release reads. \"VR Mode utilizes the 4K HDR display, eye tracking, and 3D audio to make Resident Evil Village more realistic and intense than ever.\"\nCapcom says the platform's PSVR2 Sense controllers will add even more immersion to the new mode. \n\"These [controllers] represent Ethan's famously resilient hands and allow intuitive actions to be performed in-game,\" Capcom writes in a press release. \"Players can hold up their arms to guard against enemies that get too close for comfort.

Evath's moon Mitral has turned into a gigantic gas time bomb. A meteor is also due to impact Mitral in the next several hours. You were chosen to secure each of Mitral's 18 sectors by positioning a drilling rig over the gas pockets in each sector before the meteor strikes.\nSolve challenging riddles by relying on geological clues, intuition, or good old trial and error. To survive your mission, find Rubicon crystals to restore energy and destroy (or avoid) the Laser Beacons and Skanners left behind by the Ketars. Good luck!\nOur reimplemented engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Driller support is limited to DOS (EGA mode), Amiga and AtariST releases, but we hope to be able to add more soon! Please contact us if you have some other release.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build.

Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. A new Generate World menu which now includes NewGRF, AI, and Game Script configuration menus. Cargo filters for vehicle lists (such as at stations) to allow better visualization of traffic. Optional cargo names above vehicles in vehicle lists, to show at a glance what they carry. The ability to clone or share orders with vehicles grouped by shared orders. An improved local authority action window which now shows you actions you can’t afford, instead of hiding them. In addition, some new tools are available to AI and Game Script authors: Scriptable league tables which can replace the default scoring system AI and Game Scripts can now be modified in Scenario Editor for existing scenarios (although not savegames) (As ever, see the changelog for further details).
