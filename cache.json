Any suggestions? It almost seems there may be something tonally mismatched about the idea — unless you're going for comedy — and, honestly, when playing Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club, it's sometimes tough to know whether it's horror or humour we're supposed to be enjoying. It's hard to know whether to laugh or cry.\nThis brand new entry in the Famicom Detective Club adventure series has managed to arrive to quite a bit more fanfare and interest than would usually be reserved for an entry in a visual novel franchise that, whilst perfectly fine, has never really set the gaming world alight. Old has-beens (like this writer) sampled Tantei Club Part II via fan translation and enjoyed it for what it was, but whilst the 2021 remakes are nice to have, it's hard to say they are absolute must-plays, even whilst recognising their importance in terms of influencing the likes of Ace Attorney.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It’s one of those weirder subcultures you read about in the papers, but rarely observe in daily life. \r\n\n\r\nI do, however, understand the appeal of same-screen co-op games like Run From Mummies - which, being a bloodless comedy dungeon romp, seems like a fair pick for those encumbered with boisterous selfspawn.

While it would be a monumentally silly heel turn to go back on their promise of only charging Space Marine 2 players extra for cosmetics a mere week and change before the shooter’s September 9 release date,  the new year one roadmap does at least look piously forthright.\nChatting to James at Gamescom recently (possibly from his cathedral ship made out of graphics cards), Saber boss Tim Willits dragged out an armoured horse and proceeded to flog it mercilessly, saying that players don’t want to be sold the equivalent of Oblivion's infamous deadbeat daddy of DLCs. As several of you identified, this seemed like an odd comparison when Spice Maureen 2 specifically plans to charge for comparable cosmetics, although I imagine Willits was referencing the “packs” that his space game’s baubles come in. “Our fans never thought we ripped them off in World War Z,” he said, comparing Space Marine 2’s optional spendables to that game.\nWhether you see the cosmetic's pricing as egregious or not, yesterday’s roadmap does look to make good on Saber’s promise to keep wearables and playables separate.

          "description": "Almost a decade after his acrimonious departure from Konami, the shadow of Hideo Kojima still looms over Metal Gear Solid. He's there, barely camouflaged, in the undergrowth of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - a remake of the fifth Metal Gear game, originally released in 2004, which tells the tale of a lone US special operator hunting superweapons and old mentors in the jungles of the southern Soviet Union. \r\n\n\r\nI say \"remake\" but this feels more like a re-release, in spirit. True, it now runs on Unreal Engine, with the option of a manual, third-person perspective and cover-shooter controls in addition to the old top-down viewpoints. Yes, it boasts new flourishes, such as wounds now leaving scars, and clothes picking up stray leaves. Yes, there's a new interface with floating in-world menus, which makes shuffling between the layers a bit less awkward. It's the product of much labour, with development split between Konami and external support partner Virtuos. But where Konami's other big restoration project, Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake, is a creative dialogue with the original game, Delta seems consumed by faithfulness to Kojima's original design.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's also a free-to-play game, and I have the usual unanswered questions about currencies and gacha, but I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt for the minute, because I have not spent nearly enough of my life considering the tactical applications of ballgowns.

(It came out in 1997, and as such, I think the statute of limitations on spoilers has passed, but if you still intend to play, stop reading now.) The mission completes the long arc of foreshadowing begun by the intro's mention that capital-class spacecraft have been outlawed, following a ruinous war. It turns out that one particular evil corpo has been sneakily building one of these megaships - not only that, but you get to fly inside it, cannons ablazing. It was while doing so that teenage me realised the true exceptionality of the Video Game Artform. You can't fly inside capital ships in, like, symbolist poems or baroque symphonies, can you? You can't fly in poems or symphonies at all, unless you do so metaphorically - \"metaphor\" being a kind of poor man's graphics card.\nThe technology of flight simming has advanced mightily since G-Police's day. For instance: in Everspace 2's just-announced Titans DLC, you get to fly inside not just regular old spaceships, but massive space kaiju with procedurally generated digestive systems. Here's the trailer.\nRead more",

          "description": "Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, Odyssey, and Origins all have one thing in common: they've got a Discovery mode, which replaces murdering with learning. You can, quite literally, go on tours curated by historians around each of the game's respective maps. Instead of diving off a Sphinx and plunging your hidden blade into someone's spinal column, you can look up at the Sphinx and read a paragraph on its significance. Maybe view an actual, real life bit of ancient Egypt from an actual real life museum collection in-game. Perhaps embody an Anglo-Saxon lad in Valhalla, instead, and like, cook up some nettle soup having just got a fresh \"Friar Tuck\" at the local hair choppers (no guarantees on this last bit).\nThis is all to say that Black Myth: Wukong deserves such a mode, too. There were so many times throughout my review time where I stopped and stared and wondered as to something's meaning. Not only in the architecture, but in the characters, too. So here I am with a proposition: how about instead of thwacking things with my staff, I can use it as a walking stick and point it at things I want to learn about.\nRead more",

          "description": "I shouldn’t be too surprised really. If a park sim based on Tim Burton’s 1996 B-Movie homage Mars Attacks wasn’t on my bingo card, it’s because I’ve recently binned it and replaced it with a bobble head that simply nods in amused acceptance at whatever videogames decide to do next. And conceptually, Jurassic World Evolution with captive humans instead of dinos isn’t not a potential winner, is it? Still, I was mildly bemused to learn that Mars Attracts, coming sometime next year, is the film’s first licensed game. But then I realised that I’d never thought to check before, which might go some way to explaining the lack of them. Do you reckon they did the pun then worked backwards from there? Respectable, honestly.\nRead more",

Cowboys? Sure. Wizards? Why not. It barely matters, as long as it results in some good puns. As a studio, Thunderful have a reputation for hopping from one style of game to the next, boiling entire genres down to their essence, and reconstituting them with competence and style to exist within a now-familiar steampunk world of colourful pals and Saturday morning cartoon jokes. The studio is a perpetual notion machine. Yes, with SteamWorld Heist 2, they're revisiting the sci-fi bullet-bouncing of their 2016 tactics game SteamWorld Heist, but they're also introducing significant changes to create a compulsive XCOM-like full of sea-faring submariners that may be their best work yet, even against a back catalogue of blinders. \nRead more",

Mind you, I tend to play games with my nose about 10 centimetres from the screen. Forget being flanked - it's the prospect of snipers up ahead I'm worried about.\nIf you're among the people who fret excessively about flankers, I've got great news from Uncle BioWare. Forthcoming RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard will support 21:9 ultrawide monitors. The ultrawide functionality extends to cinematics - you can disable \"cinematic aspect ratios\" to switch off the black bars that otherwise hem in the view.

Still, it does sound like he’s managing to have some fun there, mainly by hitting up Saber Interactive COO and former id Software co-owner Tim Willits for some top tips on how to avenge Edwin’s thieving ways.\nTips about kill-stealing aside, James found time to ask Willits about Space Marine 2's microtransactions, and whether there was any nervousness returning to a cult hit series… especially one a lot of people had almost given up on ever seeing again. “Even the “push forward” combat of the original was part of [id’s] inspiration when we created Doom 2016,” answered Willits. “So for me personally, it’s this huge circle. It’s always intimidating working on a franchise that people love.” But, with the right team, technology, and vision he says, “it just comes together.”\nRead more",

It's also because it was re-tooled at some point as a PvPvE extraction shooter.\r\n\nNow it's back again, aiming for release next year, and it's been re-tooled a little more: it's no longer free-to-play.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It’s just actor Troy Baker telling me about all the great acting he’ll be doing. It is great, by the way. He’s doing a fantastic job. Maybe just, you know, a crumb of acknowledgement or elucidation over the whole ‘interactivity’ part?\nAnyway, don’t mind me. I’m just an old fool who likes to press buttons.

So much so, in fact, that I’d assumed the trailer I watched during an online preview event last week was for a new entry in the horror cinematic-platformer series, right up until the name Reanimal appeared on the screen - shortly followed by a snippet of voiced dialogue.\nIt’s not just the horror setting, but the Grimm’s fairytale threat, the distorted adults-made-monsters through the trauma-tinged lens of a child’s imagination. A long-limbed man riding a bicycle in a threadbare suit chases children down an alley. A gangly, bowler-hatted pursuer scuttles down a long table like a spider. It's familiar enough territory, at least at first glance. But when Tarsier have a body of work subconsciously scarred by phantasms this vivid, recurring nightmares are just as potent.\nRead more",

          "description": "Tactical Breach Wizards is a tactics game for people that don’t like tactics games. Magically, it’s also a tactics game for people who love them like nothing else. It’s permissive and demanding; playful and tense. Its globe-spanning plot covers conspiracies, PMCs, and brutal theocratic dictatorships. It also features a traffic-summoning warlock named Steve wearing a hi-vis robe. It’s finding that one absolutely, perfectly ridiculous XCOM turn, every turn…and at the same time knowing it’s absolutely, perfectly fine if you don’t. In short: it’s one of the most enjoyable tactics games I’ve ever played, and the only tactics game with a pyromancer so rubbish he relies on making his enemies pass out from heatstroke.\nRead more",

They've also shared a little about why it's taken so long to arrive - the (generally decent) action-RPG hit PS5 over a year ago, back when I was still some filthy console-playing freelancer.\nAccording to director Hiroshi Takai, it was \"impossible\" to create the PC and PS5 versions at the same time, even if Square Enix hadn't been restrained by a timed exclusivity clause. He also thinks that the Final Fantasy series faces no \"existential risk\" right now, despite lower-than-hoped returns from both Final Fantasy 16 and, going by Square Enix's latest financial reports, the more recent and currently PS5-only Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.\n Read more",

          "description": "Silent Hill has a messy, up-is-down relationship with time and history, so let's go about this hands-on with the Silent Hill 2 Remake in a messy, up-is-down way. Developed well over two decades ago, the original Silent Hill 2 is the magnum opus of Polish horror stalwarts Bloober Team. Running on then-innovative \"Unreal Engine 5\" technology created by Jazz Jackrabbit publishers Epic MegaGames, it's a wonderful abyss of a game that remains perfectly playable today, given a certain amount of tolerance for the quirks of the era.\nIt begins with your character, James Sunderland, descending from the road towards the eponymous Midwestern nowhere-town. Like many games of the period, Silent Hill 2 uses a third-person, over-the-shoulder manual camera, which allows you to glance fearfully up at the monstrous pine trees that fringe the path - each rising from a bulging tide of fog that menaces with the suggestion of approaching figures. There is moisture everywhere, gushing from drain pipes and dribbling down concrete barriers. As you amble into the murk, deathly chords and groaning, unmechanical motifs reverberate from somewhere deep underground. \r\n \nRead more",

The 2022 version of Modern Warfare 2 lacked the original’s multiplayer, and H2M was so highly-anticipated that Steam sales of the 2016 FPS balooned in the lead-up to the mod’s planned release date. It didn't hurt that Activision had it on sale, of course, but the timing lined up so well that some fans speculated the discount was a deliberate bait-and-switch on the publisher’s part to profit from excitement over a mod they were already planning to shut down.\nRead more",

Silent Hill 2 is the more feted of the Hills - if I were a calculating franchise custodian tasked with 'bringing back' one of the acclaimed original trilogy, that's probably the instalment I and my spreadsheets would fix upon. I mean, it's the game with Pyramid Head in it - the nearest thing Silent Hill has to a mascot, and it's not like there's an issue of cutting out plot material: each game in the Silent Hill series is, on some level, a distinct story with a distinct protagonist.\nStill, the decision to 'skip' the first game in the series, whose world, narrative themes, music and art direction set the parameters for all the rest, made my brain itch a bit, and when I ran into Bloober's creative director Mateusz Lenart and lead producer Maciej Głomb at a Konami event, I had to ask about it. \r\n \nRead more",

You reel back in consternation as I bounce into the path and clobber you with a sack containing no less than eight venerable RPGs, from Baldur's Gate to Warhammer 40,000: Rogue's Trader - well over a thousand hours worth of dungeons, dragons, dicerolls, dwarven shopkeepers and many other things I refuse to spend time alliterating, all of which will (currently) set you back just £32.07. \r\n\n\r\nWere you planning to spend this weekend playing some cute two-hour artgame sideshow, without any levelling at all? Shut up, you DOLT. You will play what the nice journalist tells you to play! Best lay in extra caffeine tablets, because it's going to take you till Monday just to get through the character creators alone.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Black Myth: Wukong is an action RPG that leans a bit into the Souls camp and a bit into the adventure camp. And either way, it's a spectacular journey that works for mostly everyone: those after challenging fights against Chinese mythological creatures, and those after the same thing, but with a little less challenge than your typical Soulslikes. What separates Black Myth from the crowd, though, is its slick presentation and a sense of generosity. You're to witness the most lavish, cinematic worlds and its creatures. And you're to enjoy battering everything with your staff as a highly athletic monkey with copious spells at his furry follicles and fingertips. It's been a while since I've played anything quite as impressive as this.\nRead more",

The strategy game’s 5.2 update is on the horizon, and tagging along with it are the first of the “extra bits” the team teased in June. I’m very excited about them. They sit somewhere between the usual patch fare of stat tweaks and errata, and the weightier faction facelifts that come alongside paid DLC. They’re also focused right where Immortal Empires needs them the most: depth, rather than width. In the dawi’s case, quite literally.\n \nRead more",

Both the stakes and the poly count were low. Happy news then, that it is getting a snowy sequel.

Jak uvádí Jaromír Talíř na blogu CZ.NIC: „Když se MojeID v roce 2015 poprvé začalo připravovat na využití jako oficiální identita pro občany České republiky a došlo k zapojení do pilotního projektu přeshraniční identifikace STORK, muselo se MojeID přeci jen naučit protokol SAML 2.0. V té době již také došlo ke standardizaci OpenID Connect a jak jste se mohli dočíst na našem blogu, MojeID se tak rychle stalo službou, ke které je možné se připojit libovolným z těchto protokolů. Protokol OpenID 2.0 nicméně má svoje nejlepší léta za sebou a proto padlo rozhodnutí jeho podporu ukončit.“",

You’re running all over this place trying to figure out what the heck you need to do here, but worry not, this is what you need to know.\n\n\nWhat to do in The Great Pagoda in Black Myth: Wukong\n\n\nThis area won’t have any significance until you complete the main story and beat all other secret areas. \n\n\nEvery chapter in Black Myth: Wukong will have an area that starts with “Secret:” followed by a few Shrine points. You have to do that if you did not find them, excluding Chapter 3. So let’s get that first.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHere are all the secret areas in the game:\n\n\n\nChapter 1 (Black Wind Mountain): Ancient Guanyin Temple\n\n\nChapter 2 (Yellow Wind Ridge): Kingdom of Sahali\n\n\nChapter 3 (The New West): Mount Mei (post-final boss)\n\n\nChapter 4 (The Webbed Hollow): Purple Cloud Mountain\n\n\nChapter 5 (Flaming Mountains): Bishui Cave\n\n\n\nSelect “Continue Journey” in the main menu with that under your belt. Do not select “Enter a New Cycle”. Otherwise, you will be thrown into New Game Plus and there will be no way to return to your first playthrough.\n\n\nAs you spawn back in your first playthrough, go back and revisit the Great Pagoda from Chapter 3. Go up the stairs to the far center of the area to initiate a new post-game cutscene.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nYou’ll once again meet up with the little kid Buddha. He’ll unveil a secret behind the painting which you can now go through. What ends up happening now is that you’re going to enter an area called Mount Mei, the secret area of Chapter 3. \n\n\nIt’s a fairly straightforward area where you will encounter a familiar foe. For spoiler reasons, this will be left out. Upon defeating this secret boss, you’ll get the true final ending.\n\nThe post What to do in The Great Pagoda in Black Myth: Wukong appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Smithy is located in the southern section of the Stadium of the Sacred Flame. From the teleporter at the entrance to the Stadium, walk forward until you see a small set of stairs to the left. Go up the stairs and through the door. Head down the corridor, and you should be face to face with the Smithy.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nTalk to Alom and ask to buy some weapons. He has the forging blueprints for Natlan’s craftable weapons for sale. They don’t cost Mora, though. Instead, you’ll need to trade various Natlan regional materials as well as Condessence Crystals.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nOnce you have the blueprints, the weapons can be forged using Condessence Crystals, White Iron Chunks, and Borderland billets. If you don’t have Borderland billets, you can convert billets of another type at an Alchemy bench. Before you spend your precious billets, though, you might be able to get some of them for free.\n\n\nGet some Natlan weapons for free\n\n\nAt the time of writing, Genshin Impact has a web event with three of the craftable weapons as prizes. All three weapons have been unlocked as rewards, so all you need to do is click through the web event to receive them. This only takes a few minutes, and your rewards should be delivered instantly via in-game mail.

With the release of Castlevania: The Dominus Collection, that might happen all over again. One of the biggest apparent mysteries is The Piano Room.\n\n\nIt's entirely likely that first time players might go hunting down for clues, and people who haven't played since the DS games originally came out might have false memories. Here's where the Piano Room is.\n\n\nThe Piano Room's location\n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nWhen you first enter the Demon Guest House, you'll want to go up and to the left. Doing so will take you to a room that shows a large slide puzzle. The pieces in this room can be shifted to make various paths. By default, it should take you to an exit in the upper left hand corner, so you shouldn't need to shift anything around. \n\n\nSimply follow the path and emerge on the other end. Then go up two more screens, and take the left. That should take you to the giant Piano room. Some of the keys don't work, but most of them do. You can hop between them to relive all your Big memories, if you want. But that's about all its good for.\n\n\nAre there any secrets in the Piano Room?\n\n\nTap away all you want, but this isn't Resident Evil. No amount of playing Moonlight Sonata on this thing will open any secret passageways. Reddit users have even discussed this within the last few years, and they all agree there's nothing here.\n\n\nAll these years later, and people still wonder what secrets this piano might hold. But, unfortunately, the only thing this carries is a tune. It shouldn't be a surprise; Iga loves to put weird toys in his games. The man who loves to let you sit in chairs could easily dream up a silly piano floor, just-because.\n\nThe post Where is the Piano Room in Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The iconic Nuketown map has once again got Call of Duty fans buzzing with the reveal of the new Warzone Resurgence map, Area 99. \n\n\nThis upcoming location, known as the \"birthplace of Nuketown,\" is a nostalgic nod to the fan-favorite map in the Black Ops series. Its connection to Nuketown makes it the perfect addition for the Black Ops 6 launch, setting the stage for Warzone players.  \n\n\nThe Area 99 Flythrough trailer guides us through multiple POIs, including Weapons Testing, Nuclear Reactor, and House Factory. Areas like the Bunker make for great hiding places but will undoubtedly bring more challenges in their enclosed spaces. There are also plenty of mannequins throughout the map that are already giving me the creeps with their decrepit designs.\n\n\n\n\nToward the end of the trailer, you can spot the classic \"Welcome to Nuketown\" sign that's been in past iterations. The map dives into the origins of Nuketown, giving us a better understanding of its mysterious lore.\n\n\nBased on the overhead Tac-Map, Warzone's Area 99 looks to be a pretty big map. It may not be as substantial as Urzikstan, but there's definitely a lot to explore. The COD Next 2024 event also confirms that it's similar in size to Rebirth Island. Because of this, the location enforces more fast-paced gameplay for those who just want a quick match.\n\n\nImage via Activision\n\n\nIn addition to the origins of Nuketown, the Verdansk map makes its triumphant return to Warzone in 2025. Verdansk, the original map of Warzone, became a massive hit with the Call of Duty community. Now, fans can hop into this battleground again sometime next year.\n\n\nFortunately, we have a clearer picture of Area 99's release date, which is set for Season 1. This will presumably be tied to Black Ops 6's official launch in late October. If you want an early start, dive into the BO6 beta release to test out the exciting new features.\n\nThe post Newest CoD Warzone Resurgence map heads to the birthplace of the infamous Nuketown appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "As you progress through the story of Black Myth: Wukong, you're able to grow more powerful through weapons, armor, and spells. But how exactly can you change spells, swapping them for another in Black Myth: Wukong?\n\n\nSadly, you cannot have every spell in the game equipped. Some spells share categories, meaning you'll have to pick the one you feel will work best in general play or against specific bosses. But swapping one spell out for another isn't exactly explained all too thoroughly. If you're looking to swap from Rock Solid back to Cloud Step and you're not sure what to do, read on to learn more.\n\n\nSteps to change spells in Black Myth: Wukong\n\n\nYou can swap out spells via the Keeper's Shrine. Find a shrine and enter its menu. The option to swap out spells is found in the Self-Advance menu under the 'Set Spells' option. Clicking on the option will bring you to a new menu, in which you can exchange one spell for another. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nYou have four categories of spells in the game, covering:\n\n\n\nMysticism\n\n\nAlteration\n\n\nScrand\n\n\nTransformation\n\n\n\nYou'll have one spell in each category before you earn your first swappable spell, Rock Solid, which belongs in the Alteration category alongside Cloud Step. To swap the spell, move to a spell category, highlight the spell you want to swap to, and then press the 'A' or 'X' button on your controller. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe menu changes for mouse and keyboard users, which spreads out the spells in a horizontal line. Hover the mouse cursor over the spell category and click on the spell you want to equip.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThat just about does it for spells and spell swapping.

Until you have them all, units from the A Tier will get the job done just fine, although maybe not as efficiently. Units in the B Tier have specific situations in which they can be useful, while units in the C Tier are simply the starter units and should be replaced as soon as possible. Here's our current Special Anime Defense Unit Tier List:\n\n\nS Tier\n\n\n\nAriva\n\n\nDemon Lord\n\n\nGen (???)\n\n\nKollua\n\n\nNobora\n\n\nShanks\n\n\n\nA Tier\n\n\n\nGen (Serious)\n\n\nThick Browed\n\n\nTouci\n\n\nUltra Lucky\n\n\n\nB Tier\n\n\n\nGen\n\n\nSaske (Curse Mark)\n\n\nSoboto\n\n\n\nC Tier\n\n\n\nGoko\n\n\nNiruto Kid\n\n\nSaske Kid\n\n\n\nOne unit that is noticeably missing from this Tier List is Bolma. This is intentional because Bolma is a unique unit that is not a traditional damage-dealing unit, but rather acts as a farming unit to increase your Gold income. As such, Bolma is crucial for any strategy involving increasing your income and will be a staple unit in most lineups. Alternatively, you should also try to ensure at least 3 of the units in the S Tier are in your lineup ASAP as that will cover all your basis to give you the best chance to succeed on all levels in Special Anime Defense.\n\nThe post Special Anime Defense tier list appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Risk of Rain 2’s Seekers of the Storm DLC is out now, and it comes with a lot of new additions. One such addition is new characters, and among them is the False Son. Unfortunately, he’s one of the harder characters to obtain, partially because luck is a factor.\n\n\nTo get the obvious out of the way: in order to unlock The False Son, you’re going to need to have the Seekers of the Storm DLC and have it activated. With that out of the way, your first goal is to get to the Gilded Coast. The standard way to reach it is by finding a gold portal. These are created by finding and using a Gold Altar. You can also sometimes find them in the Bazaar Between Time for three Lunar Coins. It largely comes down to luck, but that’s not where it ends.\n\n\nOnce you’re in the Gilded Coast, you’ll need to find an Aurelionite and defeat it. It will drop a Halcyon seed, which you’ll need in your inventory.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nYou then need to defeat the False Son boss. To do this, you’ll need to loop around back to level 1 (complete a full set of regular levels). Find a Halcyon Shrine, which appears as a large green crystal. Using the Halcyon Shrine will drain you of gold, and when it’s fully activated, it will spawn a gold boss. Defeat the boss, and it will open a green portal. Go through it.\n\n\nKeep going through two more stages, and you’ll arrive at Prime Meridian. At the top of this stage is the False Son boss fight. Defeat it with the Halcyon Seed in your inventory, and you’ll be rewarded with a new character.\n\nThe post Risk of Rain 2: How to unlock the False Son appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Deadlock isn't a bad experience solo, though you'll have a lot more fun with friends. Not only can you communicate with each other and make plays more easily, but you can also get up to some shenanigans and enjoy your time far more. Who doesn't love coordinating a Dynamo and Bebop CC fiesta? As such, you might be wondering how you can get your friends in for the party. Here's how to invite your friends to Deadlock.\n\n\nHow to get your friends into Deadlock\n\n\nTo add your friends to Deadlock, you'll first need to make sure you're friends with them on Steam. You likely already are, but just in case, to add friends on Steam you want to do the following:\n\n\n\nHover over your name at the top of the Steam Client and click Friends.\n\n\nClick \"Add a Friend\" on the left sidebar.\n\n\nUse one of the displayed methods to add a friend, likely having your friend navigate to the same menu.\n\n\n\nImage via Destructoid.\n\n\nOnce you both have each other added, launch Deadlock and get to the main menu. From here, click the \"Invite your Friends\" button in the bottom right to bring up a small UI. After that, simply click on whichever friends you want to add to the game to get them in there. This could take anywhere between a few minutes up to a few days as listed, so you'll need to remain patient if they aren't added immediately.\n\n\nHow many friends can you invite?\n\n\nThanks to the way Valve is handling this playtest, you can invite as many of your friends to play Deadlock as you want! The amount of people you can add is seemingly infinite, though you probably shouldn't add people to the playtest if you know they won't play the game or will hate it. It won't harm anything, but it is a waste of time.\n\nThe post How to invite friends to Deadlock appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "For most of your matches in Deadlock, souls will be rather straightforward. You kill minions, eliminate enemy players, destroy towers, and deliver soul urns to get souls. This all is simple enough, though it becomes a tad confusing once unsecured souls come into the picture. Here's what unsecured souls are in Deadlock.\n\n\nWhat do unsecured souls do in Deadlock?\n\n\nImage via Destructoid.\n\n\nUnsecured souls are souls received upon defeating jungle camps and grabbing soul pickups off the ground. The amount you get will vary depending on the jungle camp, soul pickup, or state of the match. For example, killing a small enemy in a jungle camp (one with two bars of health) will only grant 45 unsecured souls, but you'll get much more from the bigger jungle enemies. \n\n\nAlong with jungle camps and soul pickups, any player holding unsecured souls will drop them on death. Walking up to these and standing on them for a moment will grant them to you. This is a great way to punish enemy players who spend most of the game farming jungle camps, since they'll be potentially holding a thousand or more souls for you to steal.\n\n\nYour unsecured souls will tick down over time, locking those souls to you and preventing enemies from stealing them if they kill you. As such, it's best to either not grab too many unsecured souls at once or to spend them as soon as possible. A large amount being given to the enemy can genuinely turn a match in their favor, or make holding your lead much harder.\n\nThe post What are unsecured souls in Deadlock? appeared first on Destructoid.",
