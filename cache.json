It seems he actually completed OlliOlli World not long ago - congratulating British developer Roll7 on creating a \"super fun skateboarding x side scrolling platformer\". If you've played this game, you'll know it's no easy feat.\nRoll7 responded to Doug, acknowledging how \"rad\" he was for playing the game through. It seems Doug has a bit of a soft spot for the skateboarding genre, as he was a bit of a skateboarding legend back in his younger years. Even the Birdman Tony Hawk would be impressed.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

If you've played Astroneer, you'll have witnessed first-hand how unreliable cars are (we once spent a stressful hour trying to get a giant rover out of the centre of the planet), but with trains, you'll be able to zip across ravines, difficult terrain, and boring vistas.

          "description": "A 'tad' simple.\nTime on Frog Island is like a playable fever dream in the best of ways. It places you in the role of the captain of a little sailboat who finds himself marooned on a strange island populated by a frog society. His only hope of getting off the island is by successfully mingling with the frogs and getting them to help him with the various goods he needs to fix up the ship. That’s really all there is to the story, aside from the brief dream sequences that fill in how the captain came to the island. The real draw here is in the charm of how the narrative is conveyed, such as how everyone speaks in gibberish and pantomime to get their point across.\nGameplay in Time on Frog Island could be most closely described as sandbox with some light platforming and puzzle elements. The main objective is to repair your ship with various missing items, all of which have to be sourced from interacting with the extensive trade network between the residents of the frog population.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

That means some prices are back to normal, some aren’t, and the entire concept of a deal becomes kind of nebulous and squishy. And yet, there will undoubtedly be people out there desperate for a new graphics card – any new graphics card – so let’s take a look at what’s out there.\r\n\n\r\nThe bad news is that the vast majority of Prime Day GPU “deals” still reach above the respective card’s original retail price. The good news is that I’ve found a small handful of offers that are, if nothing else, good value by the incredibly whacked-out standards of the past two years. First up, there are a couple of Nvidia GeForce RTX 30 series cards worth considering in the UK, including an MSI-made RTX 3070 (that Ebuyer have price matched). Sticking with RTX cards, which can run both DLSS and DLAA, GameStop have a reasonable RTX 3060 deal for US buyers.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Where other simulators double down on the minutiae surrounding the thing you're meant to be doing, that they put you off the thing you're meant to be doing, PowerWash Sim understands that you just want to rid surfaces of grime in the most satisfying way possible. You do not need to prize open your powerwasher with a tri-wing screwdriver or manage your finances via a convoluted banking app or determine whether a kitchen sink delivers enough pressure. Instead, you wash things with power: you power wash. You wash, powerfully.\nAfter a year in early access, the game's launching in full with a variety of modes and I cannot stress enough how stress-less the experience is. This is a first-person soother you'll either think is an absolute bore or the best kind of meditative chore.\nRead more",

To me, the Steam Deck did not do anything not already covered by the four different video game boxes I already own. The largest advantage afforded by the Steam Deck, the ability to play cool games on a handheld device, was surely the domain of the Nintendo Switch - a console that I personally use about once a year. Usually the process is that I go \"Oh yeah!\", pick up the Switch, and contemplate buying Breath Of The Wild before I see that it has not depreciated in value whatsoever since it came out five years ago. Then I turn off the Switch. \nLast week, though, I picked up the Switch, saw that Tangle Tower was on sale, and played it through in one go. \"This is great!\", I thought, marvelling at how I could play a game while sitting on the sofa, but leaving the TV free for my partner to watch whatever stupid TV show he wanted. I went to look for other cool indie games that might be on sale on the Switch, and that's when I discovered that the Switch eshop is hot garbage unless you know specifically what you're looking for. So now I want a Switch.\nRead more",

Naturally, curiosity got the better of me, so I dipped my toe back in to see what teenage Katharine had been blogging about in the mid to late 00s. Aside from all my custom images having been eaten, probably with the closure of whatever photo upload service I used back in the day, everything else was pretty much in tact. \nBut man alive. Those OPINIONS. Just terrible. Bad, awful, narrow-minded. In some ways it's quite funny looking back at how angry I was about Nintendo putting trains in a Zelda game, for example (joke's on me, Spirit Tracks would go on to become one of my fav Zelda games of all time), but in many ways I'm just quite glad I've (hopefully) moved on as a person, if only because recent weeks have reminded me there are still plenty of people out there like late 00s Katharine who are in all likelihood the same age I am now. Yes, I'm talking about the backlash to Return Of Monkey Island.\nRead more",

It's a puzzle horror game set in your traditional haunted house, aiming at a P.T. or Layers Of Fear vibe down the viewfinder of a Polaroid camera. Said camera was a second-hand gift for Luca's (that's you!) 16th birthday. It is also possessed by a demon, which is where the fun comes in, \"fun\" here meaning jump scares and hallucinatory clocks. Let that be a lesson to anyone thinking of getting their son something that was evidence in a murder as a present. This is one of many bad choices characters in Madison made. They are mostly now dead.\nThe game itself sometimes makes very good choices, though it's about 50/50 that it goes a bit too weird and ends up being silly. This makes for an intriguing mixture, especially with a complicated story of murder and neglect spanning decades, and by the end I was extremely fond of the way the sublime and the ridiculous sat side by side. The main let down isn't that Madison sometimes makes you giggle by accident, but that its multi-stage puzzles become so drawn out that you stop jumping at creepy angels and terrifying violin squeals. You've got numbers to write down and candles to move, and you don't have time for any demonic antics right now, godammit.\nRead more",

At that time, the game was essentially the naval combat bit from AC: Black Flag, carved out and extended to be its own thing. Now, years later and with many delays and reworks bobbing about in its wake, Skull And Bones is back, and looking a bit different.\nThe current state of play for Skull And Bones was revealed with a livestream tonight, featuring an explainer video walking you through some of the game features, a chonk of the game in piratical action, and a surprisingly close release date confirmation for the 8th of November 2022 (there's still time for it to be delayed again!). All those extra months in the oven have produced a decidedly Sea Of Thieves-shaped bun. But this one is all realistic and gritty, more complicated, and is taking itself seriously. You won't catch Skull And Bones announcing its new season features with a comedy song, that's for sure.\nRead more",

          "description": "Dragon Age is one of my favourite game series. I replayed Dragon Age: Origins recently not for this column, but for fun. That's the kind of wild gal I am. Origins was one of the reasons I got into PC gaming, because my dinky laptop wasn't good enough to run it and I was desperate to play it after seeing the trailers. I spaffed some of my student loan on a new desktop and spent four months eating nothing but cheese sandwiches. At the time it felt worth it. Watching those trailers now is like opening a time capsule full of fantasy tropes and, for some reason, an incongruous chugging guitar song by someone we don't need to mention ever again.\nReplaying it now is a different experience. It's still a really cool RPG, notable for very good world-building and a cast of interesting characters (that you can have sex with in a cold tent), and it continues to hold a dear place in my heart. On the other hand, there's a whole section that's such a mind-numbing slog to get through that everyone hates it and there's a mod specifically to remove it from the entire game. Origins is a game I very much like, yet sometimes struggle to explain why it is good. But I'm not alone in thinking so, 'cos in 2009 this was RPS's Game Of The Year. Can't blame me for that. I didn't even work here then.\nRead more",

Specifically, the strain they must be under carrying those preposterously high columns of metal cased packages up and down the slopes of post-apocalyptic America. If I were in his hiking boots, I'm not sure all the reinforced skeletons in the world would help me reach the same kind of porter-ing skills as he does gambolling about the place, at least not based on how sore and tired my dinky little wrists are after a couple of hours of playing Strange Scaffold's new Strand-type game, Witch Strandings. Yes, that's right. Someone other than Hideo Kojima has made a so-called Strand-like, and it's quite possibly the strangest game you'll play all year.\nRead more",

For days I’ve been absorbing these images of a baby CPU air cooler, yoked to the dinkiest of PC storage, and I still can’t decide if it’s brilliant or just sheer crawling madness.\r\n\n\r\nExcept, in the not-so-distant future, there’s a chance that active SSD cooling won’t seem so excessive at all. That’s because PCIe 5.0 drives are coming and, while they’re set to outpace even the best SSDs that use the current-gen PCIe 4.0 interface, it sounds like such speed will come at the cost of higher temperatures. And, in turn, a higher risk of throttling.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "As well as an exclusive edition from iam8bit\nOne of the most intriguing games of the summer is an adventure starring a cat — being, well, a cat — in a human-less city. Stray releases digitally for PS4, PS5, and PC on July 19, but if you're looking to pick up a physical copy, that's coming later. You've got two options.\nThe most basic physical edition of Stray on PS4/PS5 is due on September 20, for $40, and there's also an iam8bit exclusive edition for $45 that's shipping in Q4 2022.\nAccording to iam8bit, pre-orders for the standard retail edition of Stray will \"start to open up this week,\" so keep an eye on your preferred retailer. The exclusive edition, however, is up for grabs today with no deadline to worry about yet — it's an \"open pre-order.\"\nHere's what comes in the (slightly pricier) box:\n[caption id=\"attachment_334617\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1365\"] The physical Exclusive Edition of Stray for PS4/PS5.[/caption]\nStray's exclusive edition has a matte black sleeve, a 14.4\" x 24\" poster featuring our inquisitive hero, a \"fuzzy, pettable\" chenille patch, and six art cards.\nSomething else to keep in mind: digital copies will normally cost $30 (though there's currently a 10 percent off discount on Steam), and Stray will also be playable at no extra cost on PS4/PS5 if you're subscribed to PlayStation Plus Extra or Premium.\nI'm glad the wait isn't too long for the physical version, as that can be a frequent concern. Best case, maybe you can check out the game with PS Plus Extra to see if it's worth adding to your shelf, without needing to fully double-dip (or wait until September).\nAnnapurna Interactive and BlueTwelve Studio recently posted a \"spoiler-free introduction to Stray,\" if you're curious to see a bit more about the game and its world. This knocking-stuff-over tweet is also another biggie — I feel like it sums up the game's whole vibe.\nhttps://twitter.com/A_i/status/1546558650600148992\nThe post Stray is getting a physical edition in September appeared first on Destructoid.",

Explore the land of Hibernia, (which we know as Ireland today), lay waste to armies of Roman soldiers, and save the day for the land's oppressed people.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvLYsEpw_PQ\nAs you can see from the trailer above, The Ram of Hibernia is packed out with the franchise's trademark, fist-flying chaos. Studio Osome also promises to mix some exploration and puzzle-solving elements into the adventure, along with some magic and alchemy from Asterix & Obelix's druid pal, Getafix. The adventure will also support four-player co-op action, though this trailer only features two selectable characters, which seems a bit of a missed opportunity.\nIt has to be said that Asterix the Gaul is something of a specific franchise for a specific audience — ala Microids' other current point of interest, The Smurfs. Still, at least those faithful Asterix fans are eating well for the time being. Asterix & Obelix XXXL: The Ram from Hibernia launches this fall on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post There’s another Asterix game coming to PC and consoles this fall appeared first on Destructoid.",

But if you've had enough breathing room, today's a good day to pick up a DualSense controller or a PS5-compatible SSD with Amazon Prime Day deals.\nOn the controller front, Amazon has marked DualSense gamepads down to $59 for Prime Day, including newer variations like Cosmic Red, Galactic Purple, Nova Pink, and Starlight Blue. Or if you'd rather stick with a more \"classic\" look, the white and black controllers are also on sale — but you aren't saving quite as much, comparatively speaking. Those models usually cost $70, while the fancier DualSense colorways go for $75.\nA few months ago, I sprung for the Starlight Blue DualSense — it looks nice in person! Spending a lot of money on secondary controllers is never fun, especially when we've got longevity concerns, so I always try to wait for deals to pop up. This is as good as it gets.\n[caption id=\"attachment_334579\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1280\"] The 1TB WD_BLACK SN850 is a popular choice for PS5 owners.[/caption]\nStorage is another look-for-deals concern for PS5 owners in that there's just not enough to go around unless you upgrade. Amazon has discounts on numerous PS5-compatible M.2 SSDs for Prime Day, and one impulse-buy-worthy deal I've seen is this 1TB SSD from Nextorage for $110. Another one: the WD_Black SN850, which is $114 for 1TB.\nOf course, if you want to go big, there are 2TB SSDs for PlayStation 5 as well — but expect to pay over $200. When shopping around, don't forget the heatsink!\nI haven't made the SSD expansion jump yet, so I can't personally vouch for either of these, but I am getting dangerously close with PlayStation Plus Premium's game catalog crowding my PS5. If you're feeling stuck or could just use a refresher, Sony has the PS5 SSD requirements and installation process over here.\nThe post It’s a good time to buy a PS5 SSD or DualSense controller on Amazon appeared first on Destructoid.",

You know how most open-world games have that one line of repeated dialogue? I'm not even going to say the Skyrim one. But for New Vegas, it's:\n\"Patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter.\"\n\nI can just hear it in my head! NCR soldiers have uttered this phrase countless times in my playthroughs, and now you can do something about it. The mod \"immediately targets the NPC with a nuclear strike,\" and amazingly enough, it triggers both via dialogue initiated by the player or the NPC. Testudini makes it clear that the mod is compatible with pretty much anything that doesn't modify that particular line of dialogue, so it's super easy to install and try out.\nAs if I needed an excuse to go back to Fallout New Vegas, one of the most fun modern open-world games in the past few decades.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2DImcAPcdE\nThe post This insane Fallout New Vegas mod instantly nukes NPCs wishing for a nuclear winter appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Pop a flip, land a headshot\nRollerdrome is set to drop into the rink soon. Today, Roll7 and Private Division showed off the level design of this new blend of skating and shooting.\nInitially revealed during Sony's State of Play in June, Rollerdrome is a retro-futuristic game that mixes combat arenas and shooting with roller skates and sick tricks. As the player drops into arenas with both guns and skates on-hand, they'll need to navigate around and take out enemies in increasingly creative ways.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9QK8_mxwRs\nIn the video, Roll7's studio creative director John Ribbins and Rollerdrome senior 3D level designer Jacob Mills discuss how this is a bit of a departure. Roll7 is known for its OlliOlli games, including this year's excellent OlliOlli World.\nThose games are linear. They involve moving down a track, hitting tricks along the way. But Rollerdrome is a bit different.\nCombat arenas in Rollerdrome are open and free to pick apart at the player's discretion. So the team had to create a bit of flow to the arenas, teaching ideas along the way. They bring up evolving objectives, like going from eliminating an enemy to eliminating one while wallriding, as a way to do this.\nXtreme combat\nIt's a sick concept, and one I'm excited to see from Roll7. OlliOlli World seemed like the team really hitting a new stride with its skateboarding, but Rollerdrome is the team moving into both a 3D space and adding some combat too.\nThe visual throwback game will also get a special introductory price. On Steam and for PlayStation Plus members, Rollerdrome will have a price offer of $19.79. Then, after the offer's over, the game will bump up to $29.99 on Steam and the PlayStation Store. Rollerdrome will also be included in the PlayStation Plus Premium game trials at launch.\nRollerdrome rolls out for PC, PlayStation 4, and Ps5 on August 16.\nThe post Rollerdrome dev video takes a look at its retro-futuristic combat skateparks appeared first on Destructoid.",

Please use in the place of 5 to 35 ℃ . Also, if the intake and exhaust ports are blocked, the temperature of the main unit may rise. Make the air around the intake and exhaust ports better. If the temperature of the main unit becomes too high, it may sleep automatically to protect the main unit.\nWhen playing in TV mode, install the Nintendo Switch Dock in a location that does not retain heat. If there is foreign matter or dust on the air intake / exhaust port of the main unit, remove it with a vacuum cleaner. For your safety, do not disassemble the main unit.\"\n\nIt's mostly common sense type stuff folks!

It is suspected that the developer/publisher behind brands such as Tekken, Elden Ring, Dragon Ball FighterZ, and Soulcalibur has had data pertaining to its future releases, DLC, and reveals leaked online in the wake of the attack. The news was reported by malware source code monitors vx-underground.\nWhile some of the aforementioned information has surfaced online this morning, the full extent of the data obtained by the hacking group is unknown, and could contain the personal details of company employees, as well as source code for the company's current and upcoming releases, and potentially data pertaining to the users of Bandai Namco games. As for supposed leaked games, don't believe everything you see floating around.\nThis attack is the latest in a series of massive data thefts that, in recent years, have previously ransacked the digital vaults of various big-name video game companies such as Capcom, EA, and, perhaps most famously, CD Projekt RED, the latter of which lead to the release of the entire source code of smash hit Cyberpunk 2077.\nBandai Namco is yet to offer an official statement on the ransomware attack.\nThe post Bandai Namco data leaked following alleged ransomware attack appeared first on Destructoid.",

All prior content will be intact (including the two secret characters), as well as four difficulty levels, and two-player local co-op. Black Isle also confirms that the game is Steam Deck verified.\nAs always, re-releasing old content, especially classics that were out of print and faded into the rarer/pricier used game circuits, is great. Dark Alliance II has historically been one of the more sought-after PS2/Xbox games of that generation; though prices have gone down to more reasonable levels after the re-release was in the mix.\nBut while both Dark Alliance games have their charms, the real crown jewel would be the two Champions of Norrath titles. That subseries improves upon the hack-and-slash foundation with a ton of depth and polish — not to mention that they actually have offline and online four-player co-op out of the box.\nFour-player play was fairly revolutionary at the time in terms of console dungeon crawlers, and given the huge focus on online play and isolation, it still kinda is! My wife and I have randomly been popping Champions of Norrath into our PS2 for nearly two decades, and bringing that series to modern platforms would be a way easier means of doing that!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UM95ngzoqrU\nThe post Baldur’s Gate: Dark Alliance II is coming to modern platforms soon, I hope Champions of Norrath is next appeared first on Destructoid.",

In a statement printed by IGN, the publisher announced that players who own Liberation on Steam will still be able to access, re-download, and/or play the Assassin's Creed III spin-off once it is removed from the Steam service in September.\n\"As stated in our support article, only DLCs and online features will be affected by the upcoming decommissioning,\" said Ubisoft in the statement. \"Current owners of those games will still be able to access, play or redownload them. Our teams are working with our partners to update this information across all storefronts and are also assessing all available options for players who will be impacted when these games’ online services are decommissioned on September 1st, 2022.\"\n\"It has always been our intention to do everything in our power to allow those legacy titles to remain available in the best possible conditions for players, and this is what we are working towards.\"\nDespite referencing the support article, it's worth noting that this new statement offers a little more clarity when compared to the company's previous response, which seemed to suggest that the removal of player access to decommissioned titles was merely an unfortunate inevitability. It seems that this new statement, however, puts some modicum of control back into the hands of paying customers — rather than simply pulling paid products from their hands.\nAs of September 1, Assassin's Creed Liberation will no longer be featured on the Steam platform.

          "description": "It's out this summer\nKirby's Dream Buffet was just announced this morning, without a Nintendo Direct or anything! It's a four-player game that's set to release \"this summer,\" and will feature a core focus of racing through obstacle courses.\nSince it's all the info we have at the moment, here's the full rundown of Kirby's Dream Buffet from Nintendo:\n\"Roll through a smorgasbord of food-themed stages in 4 rounds of 4-player fun as Kirby…who seems rounder than usual? Race through delicious obstacle courses to collect strawberries as Kirby grows. Then, turn the tides in the final round—a fruity fight atop a floating platform. Roll through delicious, food-themed obstacle courses in 4-player matches Collect strawberries to grow bigger and prepare for the final battle. Kirby’s Dream Buffet offers easy-to-understand gameplay for players of all skill levels, but also presents a healthy challenge for those looking to satiate their craving for friendly competition.\"\n\nLocal and online play are in, but note the proviso for local multiplayer, right on the game's official site: \"Additional games and systems required for multiplayer mode. Sold separately.\"\nYou can find the Kirby's Dream Buffet listing here. That makes two Kirby games this year! Typically the fluff ball manages to knock out a ton of spinoffs these days, so this isn't as big of a surprise, but it's a welcome one regardless. I'm getting a sort of Kirby's Dream Course vibe with the rolling around, and it seems like there's a bit of Fall Guys influence there too.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOGQv0hJNJ8\nThe post Nintendo just announced Kirby’s Dream Buffet, a new multiplayer Kirby game appeared first on Destructoid.",

With the acquisition, Supermassive Games now joins Nordisk Games' family of shareholder studios, which include Avalanche Studios, Raw Fury, MercurySteam, Nitro Games, Flashbulb, and Star Stable Entertainment\n\"It’s been a little over a year since Nordisk Games made an initial investment in Supermassive Games and our vision for the future,\" said Supermassive CEO Pete Samuels in a press release. \"During that time, we have found that we share a lot of important values with Mikkel and his team, and we believe these values to be equally important to our existing commercial partners who we will continue to support.\"\n\"Having had such a positive experience over the past year it wasn’t a difficult decision when Nordisk Games wanted to explore increasing their investment. We have an exciting and ambitious growth strategy for Supermassive Games and Nordisk Games ownership only enhances that.

          "description": "PlayStation classic set for comeback?\nPopular import outlet Play-Asia has updated its store with a listing for what appears to be a PS4 and Nintendo Switch port of classic PlayStation RPG SaGa Frontier 2. The site claims that the '90s sequel will launch on the aforementioned platforms on August 25 of this year.\n\"SaGa Frontier 2 introduces a complete renovation of the RPG genre,\" reads the blurb on the store listing. \"Traditional computer polygonal fixtures are replaced with lush, hand-drawn watercolor graphics supported by an awe-inspiring musical score. Blending both freedom and linearity, this title utilizes the Multi-Scenario System giving players unparalleled freedom in choosing which scenario they want to play while other scenarios crisscross with one another.\"\nOriginally released in 1999, Square Enix's SaGa Frontier 2 retained the original game's taste for medieval warfare with an Anglo-Saxon aesthetic. The sequel featured a player-chosen dual storyline, with the fates of two young men eventually crossing paths to form a wider narrative arc. Sporting Square Enix's typical penchant for lavish visuals, dramatic storytelling, and evocative music, SaGa Frontier 2 was well received by players and critics alike.\nSquare Enix is yet to officially announce a remaster, remake, or even a mere re-release for SaGa Frontier 2, and as such the Play-Asia listing should be taken with a pinch of salt for now. Obviously, the original SaGa Frontier was remastered for the same platforms just last year, so the sequel following suit is almost a given at this point.\nWe will be sure to give you a heads-up if any confirmation is forthcoming.\nPlay-Asia lists SaGa Frontier 2 for PS4, Switch [Gematsu]\nThe post SaGa Frontier 2 for PS4 and Switch pops up on Japanese retail site appeared first on Destructoid.",

An emphasis on customization will allow players to not only fine-tune their cars' appearances to perfection but also customize the appearance of the driver themselves — a feature that takes center stage in the new Solar Crown trailer.\nFirst announced in the summer of 2020, Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown was originally expected to hit the streets this September, but became one of a litany of cross-gen releases pushed back to 2023. It was also confirmed that the PS4 and Xbox One editions of the title had been canceled. Now over two years into its development, with a release scheduled for sometime in the coming 18 months, fans are becoming a tad antsy at the persistent rolling out of cinematic trailers, and are starting to wonder when they will finally get to see the ambitious-sounding racer in action.\nTest Drive Unlimited Solar Crown is in development for PS5, PC, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown gets new trailer, but gameplay still eludes appeared first on Destructoid.",

From Pirate's Curses, to Risky's Revenges and even Seven Sirens, there's no denying that the magical gal and her fellow Scuttle Island denizens rank among the most likable, cheerful, and enduring characters of modern gaming.\nTo celebrate her 20th anniversary, boutique outlet Limited Run Games has opened pre-orders on this delightful statue. The figurine stands around 10 inches tall, (including the base), and spotlights shapeshifting adventurer in her classic genie garb and posed coyly at the viewer. There is no pajama Shantae variant, but we can't have everything.\n\nAs a fun addition, anybody who has been collecting the ongoing range of acrylic character standees will find that, once they are inserted into the base, that the statue lights up Shantae in all of her glory. It should be clearly stated that the acrylic figures are previous sale items and are NOT automatically included with the statue. An additional set of acrylics — depicting five Shantae game covers — are available in a bundle.\nIf you fancy a Shantae statue of your very own — and who wouldn't? — then she is available to pre-order now over at the official Limited Run Games store. The statue is $134.99 USD or $159.99 with the acrylic bundle, (not including shipping or any potential customs charges).

Well you can do just that, Nintendo says, at least if you're looking for English or Japanese voices.\nThe publisher posted a full one-minute video alongside the confirmation, splicing in the English cast with the Japanese one. You can hear pretty much everyone from the \"core six\" in action, and it's not even a major spoiler, as the clip has already been posted before (during the Nintendo Direct presentation for the game); and it's mostly a little traveling interlude with no major story implications.\nThis sort of dual audio at launch thing has become the norm for a lot of JRPGs, and I really dig it.

It seems that Gen 9, however, is looking set to shake that precedent up, as the Xbox Series X/S console line appears to be going from strength to strength in regards to sales in Japan.\nIn recent data summarized by Famitsu and analyst @Benjisales Xbox Series X/S has sold somewhere in the region of 260,500 consoles since its launch in the fall of 2020, that's already over double the lifetime sales of Gen 8 hardware Xbox One, which sold just under 115,000 units in Japan over the course of its production run.

While that heat cap is pretty impressive, we'd recommend not testing it. \nBy way of Nintendo Life, Eurogamer referenced Nintendo Japan's Customer Service Twitter account, which advised Switch owners to avoid staggeringly high temperatures and keep the intake and exhaust ports unblocked.  The good news is that if the console gets too hot, it’ll automatically sleep. And for those who like to play using the Switch port, keep the setup in a cool spot.

However, while the game features many tenants of the open-world genre, Sonic Team is adamant about calling Frontiers an \"open-zone\" game instead. While on the surface that sounds like little more than a marketing ploy, after chatting with the developers, it makes more sense as you dig deeper into its meaning.\nComing off 2017's Sonic Forces, a game that didn't fare well with critics or fans, the development team wanted to shake things up. Forces received criticism for its generic 3D level design, unfulfilling story, short length, and poor 2D gameplay compared to the then-newly released Sonic Mania. According to Sonic Frontiers director Morio Kishimoto (who a…",

According to information coming from Japan, Takahashi was found floating in shallow waters on the coast of Nago City on the Island of Okinawa by the country’s Coast Guard yesterday, July 6. He was wearing snorkeling gear when found by the Coast Guard. Both the Coast Guard and local police are investigating his death. \nTakahashi’s manga career began in 1982, but it didn’t truly take off until the release of Yu-Gi-Oh! in 1996. In between his start and Yu-Gi-Oh!, though, Takahashi published titles like Fighting Hawk and Tennenshoku Danji Buray, according to Kotaku. After Yu-Gi-Oh! hit shelves in 1996, the series only continued to grow in popularity, spawning a real-life card game in 1999 (that’s still extremely popular today) as well as multiple anime series. Today, the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise spans not just manga, card games, and anime, but video games as well, like this year’s Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel. \n[Source: NHK via IGN]\nThe staff at Game Informer extends their condolences to Takahashi’s family.",

Here’s what the official site has to say on the matter: \nThe Matrix Awakens was first announced and made available on the same night during the 2021 Game Awards. The Unreal Engine 5-powered demonstration from Epic Games stars Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss, who introduces the impressive graphics engine and how close to real-life its visuals can look. Awakens includes an on-rails car shootout throughout a city that often looks like it was ripped from the silver screen despite being rendered on the spot. The demo then lets you roam the massive pre-populated city and change things like time of day or traffic congestion to flex what UE5 is capable of. It’s a terrific showcase for the future of games, so if you haven’t given it a download yet, you’ll want to check it out before the delisting on Saturday.\nYou can watch us tour The Matrix Awakens in this episode of New Gameplay Today.",

That’s because the studio is launching Gwent: Rogue Mage, a new single-player roguelike deckbuilder, tomorrow. \nAnnounced by IGN, Gwent: Rogue Mage launches tomorrow, July 7, on PC, iOS, and Android. IGN reports that this game is what Project Golden Nekker, which the team revealed earlier this year, has turned into, and CD Projekt Red is marketing it as a single-player expansion to Gwent: The Witcher Card Game. However, you won’t need to own that because Rogue Mage is standalone. You can purchase the standalone version for $9.99 or the premium edition, which includes in-game skins and cosmetics, and card packs for the multiplayer portion of Gwent, for $19.99. \n“Rogue Mage came out of us noticing that years after The Witcher 3’s release, there are a significant number of players who want a more PvE experience from Gwent,” game director Vladimir Tortsov told IGN. “While Gwent multiplayer is a fantastic game for those who are looking for a great PvP multiplayer experience, we perfectly understand that many Witcher players loved the original mini-game of Gwent for totally different reasons. With Rogue Mage, we aim to give this audience a reason to play modern-day Gwent in the format they prefer.” \nIGN has an exclusive preview of Gwent: Rogue Mage after going hands-on with it ahead of tomorrow’s release, and if you’re looking for even more details about it, including what this single-player deckbuilder roguelike’s gameplay is like, be sure to check it out. \n[Source: IGN]\nAre you excited to check out Gwent: Rogue Mage?

Months later, the team is still adding new things to the game, which is exactly what today’s Patch 1.17 does for the open-world RPG. \nMore specifically, Patch 1.17 brings three new things to the game: variable refresh rate (VRR) support, high refresh rate (HFR) support, and a new “Balanced” graphics mode that introduces a 40Hz refresh rate for displays that support it. \n\n\nThe game only supports VRR on monitors or TVs that feature VRR and if yours does, you can expect improved “dynamic resolution scaling on 60Hz.” Both VRR and HFR target a refresh rate between 60Hz and 120Hz, so if…",

          "description": "Nearly 30 years after its initial release, Live a Live is finally coming west. This 1994 Super Famicom RPG is from creator Takashi Tokita, one of the key developers behind Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy IV. While it would be fascinating to play through Tokita's original vision of Live a Live, we're getting an enhanced remake using the same HD-2D graphical style from the Octopath Traveler games.\nI recently spent roughly five hours in this ambitiously designed title, and can confidently say I enjoyed almost every second of its unique approach to storytelling and how it's brought to life through beautiful retro visuals. Square Enix is releasing Live a Live on Switch on July 22. Here are a handful reasons why you should put it on your radar:\nSeven Distinct Stories\nA Fun Assortment of Characters\nAdult Language and Humor?\nExcellent Writing\nCombat Has Depth...But Will We See It Enough?\n\n\nIt's Beautiful\nThe 2D-HD look is every bit as stunning as it is in Octopath Traveler. The backdrops in each story are a feast for the eyes. The sprite characters don't offer much animation but do move appropriately to convey an emotion or to highlight a dramatic sequence. The visuals scream of the 16-bit age, but also have modern touches everywhere, like realistic lighting of saloon doors swinging when the stranger strolls in to grab a drink.",

I’m excited by the news because I was worried these excellent spin-offs would never receive a revival like the platforming Mega Man series did a few years back. Many Battle Network games are currently only available on the Game Boy Advance or the now-dying Wii U virtual console, while others remain locked away on the Nintendo DS. However, a large chunk of the series will now be available to anyone who owns a PlayStation 4, Switch, or a PC running Steam.

Announced by Ubisoft today, this show kicks off at 11 a.m. PT and will hopefully provide a substantial look at the open-world multiplayer ship battles and progress made since the delay. Skull and Bones showed promise when it was first announced during an E3 press conference in 2017. Slated to release in the following year, it was indefinitely delayed, even thought to be canceled given the lack of updates from Ubisoft. With fresh wind behind its sails, we will now see what it looks like on current-gen platforms. Come Thursday, you can view the Ubisoft Forward livestream right here.\nUbisoft also revealed a second livestream slated to air on September 10. We don't know what games are in this presentation, but Ubisoft's blog says it will be for multiple projects. Here's hoping Star Wars, Avatar, Assassin's Creed, and Splinter Cell are mentioned in some capacity, if not outright shown.\nUntil then, are you excited for Skull & Bones?

That's right, the world will now suffer from the might and insensitive jokes of two Cryptos invading at once. The latest trailer for Reprobed shows off the co-op carnage, and also provides a great look at the rearranged maps, which feature more buildings, plant life, and things to blow to kingdom come.\nReprobed is slated to release on PC and PlayStation and Xbox consoles on August 30. A $399 collector's edition is on the way and comes with a 27.6-inch Crypto figurine, an Arkvoodle statue, a CD of the orchestral score, and an artbook.\nThe remake of the original Destroy All Humans felt a bit dated. In our review, Joe Juba said \"The brightest moments are when the action gives way to pure chaos. I watched electricity arc between humans, made brains pop out of heads, and turned a secret base into smoldering ruins with my spaceship’s death ray. But like a person floating above the ground in the glow of an abducto beam, those moments aren’t connected to anything substantial; they just make some noise and get flung aside.\" The remake of the sequel modernizes more of the content. Let's hope that helps Crypto find new life again. I'd love to see an entirely new adventure with this foul-mouthed alien leading the charge.\nPurchase",

The company wanted to gather a group of experienced but still-passionate developers, all focused on the idea of creating something ambitious despite the studio’s smaller size. The surprise, however, comes from the studio’s approach to narrative. According to Markuszewski, Starward looked for stories that weren’t already “exploited” by media when figuring out its first project. It wanted to tell a story that hadn’t been told.\nAdmittedly, where Starward landed was a story told before – almost 60 years ago, in the novel The Invincible, written by Stanisław Lem.

Fortunately, the team behind the devilishly cute game has released a new trailer with tips and tricks to start, and maintain, the best cult.\nThe first step is simple: grow your flock. All you need to do is fight through hordes of demon monsters to save innocent woodland creatures that will make for perfect initiates. Of course, you rename each addition and select other facets of their new life to dictate what kind of cult member (and worker) they’ll be for you.\nCheck it out in action: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, growing your flock is just the first step. You also need to satisfy the faithful. To do this, you must tend to your congregation by leading and feeding them and ultimately keeping them happy. You can give them gifts, invite them to feasts, and much more. The final step is to cleanse the non-believers, naturally. \nUnhappy cult members might lose faith in you, but this is fixable. You can opt to re-educate them in the ways of your cult, which will hopefully stop them from persuading other members to rise against you, or, if you just can’t see a solution, you can always sacrifice them to the gods. \nAnd there you have it – you’re ready to start a cult.

Join editors Marcus Stewart and Andrew Reiner as they try the upcoming sequel on for size and weigh in on the game’s big changes. We’ll also be playing duos in Fortnite because, well, why not?\nOverwatch 2 arrives as a free-to-play multiplayer game on October 4, and Blizzard continues working out the kinks in this new beta. We’ll try out the new hero, Junker Queen, tour the new maps, and see how we adapt to the new 5v5 format. \nWe’ll play an hour of Overwatch 2 before switching over to Fortnite. Reiner, a seasoned veteran, will carry me, someone who rarely touches the game but bought a Spider-Man skin just because, to a victory royale. Maybe.

That means the console looks like a big, cracked slab of dwarven-crafted uru that still channels electricity and may or may not be liftable depending on if you’re worthy. It's hard to tell if that handle is real or simply edited into the photo for full effect, but you should probably assume the worst (best?) when considering making space for this thing. \nThe contest begins today and concludes on July 21. To enter, you just need to follow the Xbox Twitter account and retweet #ThorLoveandThunderXboxSweepstakes. You can read the full contest rules here.",

The studio also says that no other developer is working on projects related to the franchises. \nThis news comes from a new blog post highlighting Sucker Punch’s 25th anniversary. Since opening its doors more than 20 years ago, the studio has worked on Rocket: Robot on Wheels, the popular Sly Cooper platformer series, the superpowered Infamous series, and of course, Ghost of Tsushima.

The idea of getting a demo this year is certainly enticing too, as Sea of Stars has looked phenomenal every time it’s made an appearance. \nThe game was first revealed in 2020 after a successful Kickstarter campaign and evokes JRPGs like Chrono Trigger, Illusion of Gaia, and Breath of Fire. It even features music contributions by Chrono Trigger composer Yasunori Mitsuda. Despite being a role-playing title, it serves as a prequel to 2018’s The Messenger, a Ninja Gaiden-inspired action game that was well-recieved (here’s our review). Sea of Stars centers on two heroes who wield the power of the moon and the sun to battle an evil alchemist. You can watch the original reveal trailer below.",

In Pow Wow Entertainment's newly announced racer, Stuntfest: World Tour, I'm hoping the unique ejector-seat functionality is so jaw-droppingly incredible that it becomes the next craze. In the game's first trailer, we see drivers rocketing out of their cars to bounce off pads or ignite a jetpack's thrusters.\nStuntfest: World Tour is in development for PC with publishing duties handled by THQ Nordic sometime in 2022. We don't have many details yet, but a press release states that the player can assume the identity of a \"punker granny\" or a \"famous streamer\" with the hope of winning elimination-style stunt shows featuring 18 drivers. The competitions range from destruction derbies to glider racers. When the player hits the ejector button and their driver launches hundreds of meters into the air, they can be freely controlled and gadgets can be used to gain an edge. When descending, the next car you see can be yours to drive. Progress in the world tour rewards you with vehicle upgrades.\nStuntfest: World Tour has a hell of a hook, but it's difficult to figure out how these races will unfold. I can't wait to get my hands on this game to see if this unique gimmick (and the high levels of destruction) add up to something special.",
