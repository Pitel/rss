          "description": "Zero to hero.\nThough Capcom hasn’t necessarily abandoned the Mega Man brand as a whole, it’s indisputably reduced how often it produces new games in that celebrated franchise. For example, it’s been 19 years since the last new Mega Man X release (and let’s be real, X8 was a rough entry to end on), but that series now lives on in the efforts of its fans. A few years ago, Battery Staple Games released 20XX, a cute roguelite take on Mega Man gameplay, and now it’s followed up that effort with 30XX. It isn’t without issues, but we’re happy to report that 30XX feels like an overall improvement over its predecessor, and stands as a worthy homage to a beloved series.\nGameplay in 30XX follows the template of classic Mega Man X. You run ‘n’ gun through eight themed levels capped off with a tough boss fight, collecting new weapons or abilities each time you beat another boss, then challenge some extra tough final stages. The gimmick here, however, is that 30XX is structured like a roguelite, so each stage is different each run and there are myriad upgrades you can collect along the way to help even the odds a little bit. There are two playable characters, named Ace and Nina, and they take after Zero and X, respectively. Both have their pros and cons, though we generally preferred Nina’s ranged gameplay over Ace’s sword-swinging skills.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The populace of a children’s toy box has become obsessed with professional wrestling, idolising the likes of Macho Man Randy Savage and Jake the Snake.

I also know that its video game adaptation, released in 1995 for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, was a 16-bit platformer with a similar appeal to other Disney games of the period like Aladdin and The Lion King.\r\n\nBoth those games were re-released in 2021, and now it's Gargoyles' turn. There's a first trailer for Gargoyles Remastered below.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I've only played about two hours of it so far, but it's clear there's still a lot more to discover within its dreamy little vignettes. It's one of those games that's designed to be played multiple times to get the full extent of the story, and I've just hit the first of those Nier Automata-esque restarts.

I wasn't quite expecting to enjoy The Man Came Around, then, as it's about a group of desperate people trying to cross the border to escape their authoritarian government. In Winter, no less.\nIt's actually rather light in practice, although not in a flippant or trivialising way. The message is clearly that these things are serious and our sympathies should be, well, basic concern for the wellbeing of other people. But it's not as miserable to play as games with such serious themes often are. The premise is serious, but the act of playing it is not. I'd call it \"diverting\" rather than \"entertaining\", but the bottom line is there's a good afternoon or two in there for you.\nRead more",

          "description": "Confession time: if you've been keeping up to date with Colossal Order's feature highlight video series for Cities: Skylines 2 over the last couple of months, you're probably not going to learn a huge amount from my experience of playing it at Gamescom a couple of weeks ago. I spent most of my hour-long demo session steadily working my way through its extensive tutorial, as I have not, in fact, played Cities: Skylines before now - although I can at least confirm that its tutorial is very newbie-friendly, and that I now feel more prepared to give it a go properly when it comes out in full on October 24th.\nBut the thing that really impressed me was just the sheer scope of its playable spaces. We've known since the end of July that its maps are roughly 5x bigger than those in the first game, and when I saw Colossal Order's Maps & Themes video, I thought, 'Yes, those sure look enormous!' But actually seeing them in person really put things into perspective for me, especially when I tried zooming the camera out and it just kept going and going and going and… \nRead more",

In this foetid offering from Argentinian devs Andrés Borghi and Tobías Rusjan of Saibot Studios, you play a young woman, Julia, who is visiting her film-maker ex-boyfriend to drop off their old apartment key. Julia’s having a hard time getting over the break-up, but she’s clearly doing better than her ex: his apartment is full of broken glass, anomalous red gloop and creepy occult books. \r\n\n\r\nThe game’s twist is that it’s two visual styles thrust into the same frame. On the one hand, you'll explore an 8-bit world of unpleasantly bright colours, finding and combining objects adventure-game-style. I say adventure-game-style, because this is a bit more energetic than most adventure games – you can equip and swing a wrench, and there’s a run button. On the other hand, well. Click the headline to find out, if you dare. Yes, this is me trying to do a jumpscare. Brace yourself!

A quick reminder of the rules: I can only acquire new ships by commandeering them, with no planetary landings permitted, which also means that I can't just shuffle between ships at whim after adding them to my hangar. It's possible the game contains an orbital shipyard of some kind - if you've found one, don't spoil! - but at the time of writing, any vessel I abandon is essentially gone for good. \r\n\n\r\nMy first trophy as greenhorn orbital bandit Mary Read was a UC Transpo, which isn't so much a spaceship as a shoebox with toilet roll tubes and detergent bottles glued to the outside, its ordnance limited to a single laser. I began my second leg confidently expecting to spend many hours in this Fisher Price starmobile, vainly searching for a wounded battlecruiser or an abandoned solar yacht or some other, more capable vessel accessible to a space pirate of extremely modest means. This is going to be Jalopy: Galactic Edition, I said to myself.

If you missed them, they were mostly in the vein of saying our increased volume of BG3-related posts felt like \"spam\", harking back to when we (and the internet at large) all went similarly bananas over Elden Ring last year. I know it can sometimes seem like writing about these games - particularly on RPS - feels like we're somehow neglecting everything else going on in PC gaming.

It's your own card units that are the ones moving along pre-defined tracks wreaking havoc on stationary enemies, not the other way around. Maybe tower assault would be a better term, but that's by the by. Served with a dollop of anime froth on the top, Affogato should be my exact cuppa joe.

But it comes to something when a 70s depresso-capsule at the bottom of the sea has more square footage and storage space than I do.\nUnder The Waves (which got patched today, and not before time because I've had one fatal error crash per play session since it came out last week so far) is about a deep sea diver called Stan, who is living and working at the bottom of a big wet metaphor for grief. You will know this because a) its Steam page says this up front, and b) it's not super subtle (this game is published by Quantic Dream). But, as newsman Edwin pointed out to me today, when was the last time the sea wasn't a metaphor for grief? It's never a metaphor for enjoying a nice raspberry ripple ice cream. And despite Stan making reference to \"what [he's] been through\" half an hour in, I think it does a great job with its chthonic sadness. You float about in your tiny little sub in a great misty darkness, listen to the extremely melancholy music, and you start thinking about sad stuff in your own life.

One intrepid soul, Draspian, has tinkered with the code to disable said invisible boundaries, and in the process, revealed that planetary maps do, in fact, join together, though as you might be expecting, Starfield doesn't take kindly to being treated this way.\nRead more",

It's this scale that makes Starfield feel unfortunately small and empty, a place that still has those fun little Bethesda side quests that escalate into something huge and absurd, but that can also swallow them whole in its cold, star-scattered grandeur.\nRead more",

The nearest I got to playing 40K as a lad was its Battlefleet Gothic spin-off (which none of my friends were interested in, so when I say \"playing\", I mean that I sat in a room staring glumly at some unpainted Lunar-class Cruisers while other kids went out and climbed trees). The framing I'm working with instead, based on an hour of hands-off Rogue Trader gameplay, is that it's sort of Warhammer Mass Effect, but with XCOM-style turn- and grid-based combat, and while there are opportunities to be a compassionate hero, you fundamentally only have the option of playing Renegade.

Rather, this is a game that's designed to unfurl slowly, bit by bit, over the course of several hours, and before we begin, developer Frame Break's CEO Joakim Hedström tells me they've shortened the game's opening sequence for this particular demo, just so they can get players right into the thick of things as quickly as possible. \nBut even on this whistlestop tour, there's plenty to dig into and delight in here - not least its gloriously bright and inviting colour palette (take that, Todd).

          "description": "Ring the bell, everybody, it's time for another round of game developers telling players that they don't really understand what a \"game engine\" is. The spark this time is little-known science fiction adventure Starfield, which I believe we've reported on before. The game has a few obvious foibles - in my experience as a space pirate, NPCs sometimes struggle to navigate their surroundings, and then there are those stark disconnects between planetary surfaces and orbital space. Hiccups such as these have led a few players to wonder whether the game might work better using different technology, and in particular, the newer versions of Epic's ubiquitous Unreal Engine. Isn't Bethesda's proprietary Creation Engine, which the company have been updating since 2011, getting a little long in the tooth?\nYou'll find a lot of the discussion below this post from Digital Foundry boffin John Linneman on Twxter, which has attracted both gloating PlayStation fans (remember, Starfield is Xbox-only in console land) and a number of thoughtful replies from some fairly senior game developers. This conversation goes back a fair way, of course - people have been ragging on Bethesda for using \"the same engine\" for years. And there's a definite air of world-weariness to some of the developer responses.\r\n \nRead more",

By total coincidence - I promise you it's accidental, I was so pleased - I've been working on a \"land on no planets\" run of Starfield. The reasoning for this is as follows: people say that outer space is the worst part of the game, because it's just an irritating interval between the maps where the majority of quests, loot, intrigues, etc are found. It's a fast travel loading screen you can fly about in. But what if you double-down on the space stuff? \r\n\n\r\nWhat if you never descend from orbit, not even to repair, modify or upgrade your ship and offload inventory? What if, rather than buying new ships or building them, you progress exclusively by boarding other captains and making off with ship and cargo? How well does Starfield scrub up as a thoroughbred space sim that leans towards bloodthirsty piracy? Here to answer these questions is Mary Read, my custom character and budding astral freebooter. She's named for her distant ancestor, the legendary 18th century English buccaneer Mary Read. She's had a crack at life on shore, setting foot most recently on Earth's Moon, but from this point on, her fate and fortune lies amid the stars. Arrr!\r\n\n \nRead more",

For me, the final act of BG3 is the act when all my nonsensing in the rest of the game paid off.

          "description": "As someone with a general aversion to online competitive modes in games, I'm always grateful when someone, for once, especially in this age of endlessly bland multiplayer experiments, thinks of the solitary solo player. I'm especially grateful when us single player preferers get a knowing nod of acknowledgement in fighting games, too, which are so naturally geared toward pitting your skills against other human beings that anything involving playing against the AI is often either an afterthought or so threadbare that you can't help but feel like you're missing the point. \nBut that's still, for my sins, how I like to consume fighting games when I occasionally play them - which isn't often, I'll admit, for exactly the reasons described above - and so when I sat down for my Mortal Kombat 1 demo session at Gamescom this year, I was pleased to see not just a very slick story mode in attendance, but also a new single player challenge mode called Invasions that publishers Warner Bros described as \"a giant interactive board game\" that \"lent into action RPG\" territory. Its numerous node-based missions looked substantial based on what I played, and the idea of applying a seasonal service model to it, endlessly rotating in new locations and missions every so often - a whole different Invasion, so to speak - is actually something I'd be very much behind. It, that is, I was a) good at Mortal Kombat, and b) the missions I played during my demo weren't quite so… err… boring.\nRead more",

The adventure game's strong premise of a writer magically entering books to steal treasures wore thin across uninteresting puzzles, repetitive crafting, bland combat, and—worst of all for a game about the wonder of words—iffy writing. But once the credits rolled, I realised I had been fooled by its polished looks, and its core development was team was tiny (with a squad of external contributors), leaving me feeling a lot more forgiving. So, it's a good game to check out on Game Pass, or at least flick through the opening chapters.\nRead more",

          "description": "\"Modders will fix it\" is a cliché, but the thing about clichés is they’re rooted in fact. So it is with Starfield, which already has a DLSS mod ready to patch in the class-leading Nvidia upscaler that Bethesda left out in favour of AMD FSR 2.\nIt’s the work of seasoned modder PureDark, previously seen hammering both DLSS and FSR into Skyrim. I’ve tried the Starfield mod and it works rather nicely, granting a visible quality boost on RTX graphics cards while equalling FSR’s ability to smooth out Starfield’s sometimes-tricky performance. Unfortunately (and largely by association), it’s also been dragged into a spot of nasty business, one involving a separate mod for DLSS 3 frame generation and PureDark’s application of DRM.\nRead more",

Especially when I get to the characters saying ‘I love you’ to each other…” Gaider mimes the sickliness of the scene and his own horrified response. “Apparently I did it so well on Baldur’s Gate II that James Ohlen kept handing me this stuff. And, god, I hated it so much.”\nIt’s weird, in fact, that Gaider wound up working on Baldur’s Gate II at all - let alone that he became synonymous with Dragon Age and romanceable companions afterwards. At 27 years old, he ran a hotel in Edmonton, Alberta - the same city where, unbeknownst to him, Bioware was busy making its name. Once it came time to make a sequel to Baldur’s Gate, Bioware cast around for local writers, and a friend recommended Gaider, who had played D&D in the ‘80s before it fell out of fashion.\nRead more",

Well, at the risk of empirically demonstrating that romance is dead, it turns out all that might have been down to a technical problem.

Space sim fanatics were dismayed to learn that you can't actually fly down to the surface of the planets you're orbiting - instead, you hit a button to initiate a loading break and a landing cutscene, which makes outer space feel more like a glorified airlock chamber than, well, outer space. This segmented approach has prompted many unflattering comparisons with No Man's Sky, in which you can manually pilot through the atmosphere. \r\n\n\r\nPlayers and critics were similarly disappointed by the apparent inability to manually fly between planets in different orbits - instead, the game invites you to pick a destination from your star map or while using your spaceship's scanner HUD, with the journey condensed to a cutscene, again. Well, I bring news on this front. You can actually fly \"to\" and perhaps even \"between\" planets in Starfield. But there are some buts. Buts of astronomical dimensions. Onward!\r\n\n \nRead more",

Around the turn of the millenium, 1GB sticks were commonplace, and by doubling that amount over time we've gradually worked our way up to 8GB, 16GB and 32GB sticks of DDR4 and DDR5 being common sizes. Now though, DDR5 manufacturers are also producing an intermediate 24GB size, allowing for 48GB kits of two sticks each.\nThis new capacity requires a BIOS update for most motherboards, but pricing on it can be quite good - and that's what we're seeing today, with extremely rapid DDR5-6400 CL36 RAM available in a 48GB capacity for $130 after a $18 price drop.  \nRead more",

Verne Colon The Shape Of Fantasy is, at least in part, an adventure game, and weaker for it. Taken as 'pure' interactive fiction, it'd be shorter and simpler, but might allow its premise, atmosphere, and intriguing world to shine the way they ought to.\r\n\n\r\nThe premise actually takes some explaining. Jules Verne himself takes the place of Aronnax, the protagonist of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Seas, and instead of mere hermitry, his new submarine home/prison is devoted to a guerrilla war against The Nation, a Prussian-ish empire you might be able to stop using a techno-magical gubbins that allows you to edit reality.

          "description": "Earlier this week I attended a hands-off preview for Owlcat's forthcoming CRPG Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, which is shaping up nicely, inasmuch as there's anything \"nice\" about a Warhammer 40,000 game. Rogue Trader is a party-based affair in which you play a sort of Warhammer East India Company, tasked with flipping outlying worlds to the Imperium. In order to carry out this goal, you're granted a lot more individual license than most human residents of the 40K universe. You can, for instance, recruit ungodly xenos to your grimdark troupe, operate a private armada, and even colonise planets and turn them into your own personal piggybank. Just watch you don't push the whole \"heresy\" thing too far.\r\n\n\r\nI'll have more for you on the subject soonish, but here's an interesting advance snippet from my interview with Owlcat's creative director Alexander Mishulin, in which we discussed what really distinguishes a CRPG from other kinds of role-playing game. According to Mishulin, it's all about designing for choices with consequences that genuinely run the entire length of the game, without (somehow) getting lost in the narrative undergrowth.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The number three might not signal a sweeping change to the formula, then, but that's arguably a good thing.

At the time I thought it was a bit of a duff pretender, honestly.\nBut a good chunk of time with it at this year's Gamescom has swivelled my head back in its direction. Having clacked through some dingy streets, fired blue gloop from my arm, and fought the literal King Of Puppets, I've come to realise it has the potential to be a magnificent Soulslike in its own right.\nRead more",

A na scheduleru systému je, aby úlohy rozhazoval jádrům pokud možno optimálně, tedy například i v situacích, kdy je sice nejlepší jádro CPU volné, ale úloha běží na jiném CCX modulu v jiném segmentu L3 cache a její přesun tam a zpět by byl horší než nechat úlohu doběhnout na jiném, ale bližším CPU jádru, případně existuje vhodnější CPU jádro z hlediska parametrů frekvence a napětí pro danou frekvenci.",

          "description": "There was plenty of excitement when a S.T.A.L.K.E.R. sequel was announced by GSC Game World. Nobody could have predicted just how tumultuous the development cycle would be. The game has faced numerous delays due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine which forced the team to quickly relocate from Kyiv to Prague.\nThis was far from the end of their problems, as they would also suffer cyber attacks originating from Russia. Because of all these hurdles, the game's release date has shifted to 2024. It appears that a new kind of problem has appeared, this time in the form of fire.\nIt was originally reported by the Czech publication Vortex on September 8 that GSC Game World had suffered a fire in their offices. According to PC Gamer, nobody was hurt in the fire, and a GSC representative has confirmed that the incident is under investigation.\n[caption id=\"attachment_403508\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via GSC Game World.[/caption]\nBattered but not beaten\nIn its official Discord server, the studio confirmed a few more details about the fire, including that although the fire was quickly put out, an office floor will need full restoration. Despite the setback, developers remain intent on releasing S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2, and their confidence is motivated by the fact that they've \"dealt with worse than that before.\"\nIt's certainly a true statement, as despite escaping a warzone, developers have been able to present a playable demo at this year's Gamescom. Although GSC Game World has attempted to defend the demo's \"imperfect\" state, the reception to it has been relatively good.\nThe post S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 devs face a new challenge – fire appeared first on Destructoid.",

I feel as if — in many, but maybe not all cases — the Venn diagram of anime fans to gamers is a perfect circle.\nThere are also a metric ton of games based on anime — My Hero One’s Justice, One Piece Odyssey, and Dragon Ball FighterZ, to name three. On the flip side, there are even more anime based on games — the recently released Nier Automata adaptation, Persona 5: The Animation, and Doll’s/Girl’s Frontline.\nIt’s a fool’s errand to say the two media are not connected.

          "description": "Roblox has a firm grip on the gaming world thanks to a few key elements that have helped it attract millions of players. For instance, it's a small game that isn't going to tax even the most dated PCs. Furthermore, it also has strong social elements, allowing players from around the world to use it as a virtual hangout spot.\nA recent blog post from Roblox outlined some of the revelations from the Roblox Developers Conference (RDC) which took place in San Francisco. Developers plan to continue making Roblox one of the best places for friends to communicate and play together. The game will also be expanding its reach when it finally launches on PS4 and PS5 in October.\nThis is a long-awaited port, as Roblox has conspicuously not been available in the Nintendo and PlayStation ecosystems despite its popularity. Currently, the game supports crossplay, though it hasn't been confirmed yet whether the PlayStation ports will also have crossplay capabilities.\n[caption id=\"attachment_374524\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Roblox Corporation[/caption]\nWhat to expect from Roblox in 2023 and beyond\nRoblox will be making things a little easier for creators and giving them more freedom. New mesh and texture APIs will be added, allowing you to edit your avatar and avatar items such as clothes within an experience. Developers also intend to craft tools that enable users to create avatars from text inputs.\nLater this year, Roblox Connect will also launch. In a bid to further expand the game's available features, Roblox Connect will let you call other players and display your facial expressions through your avatars, and all that's needed is your device's camera.\nRoblox will also be coming to Meta Quest. The open beta has already been released, and in the first five days, it was downloaded over a million times. It comes just in time for the Quest 3 which is scheduled to launch later this year.\nThe post Roblox finally coming to PlayStation appeared first on Destructoid.",

In a final update on Steam, they state that the game has been a source of stress over the past several months, and they now want to put the game behind them.\nIndiesolodev will take the time off to grow as a developer, and they shared plans for a new game in the works called Kith.\n“‘Kith’ - it will be a new experience and a new concept with realism, a completely different genre and setting, and the emphasis is on cinematography. This time I hope the project will be created by a small team. This is a challenging project on which I want to significantly improve my skills in game design.”\n\nThis is not the first time Only Up! was removed from Steam. It was taken down briefly back in late June amidst controversy regarding stolen assets. Indiesolodev quickly removed the problematic assets, and the updated game was back on Steam in a matter of days.\nThere has also been pushback to NFT artwork being featured on some assets in what many players saw as an advertisement for NFTs.\nDespite the controversy and janky controls, Only Up! was quite popular on Twitch for a time, attracting the attention of let’s players and speedrunners. With the sudden increase in scrutiny, it’s no wonder the developer felt stressed. \nI’m glad Indiesolodev is taking some time for themselves. Hopefully, with the support of a team behind them, the development of Kith goes much more smoothly.\nThe post Only Up! voluntarily removed from Steam, this time for good appeared first on Destructoid.",

The new FFXIV survey inquires about all the important personal details, like favorite mounts and minions, how you describe the game, and so on. Then there's a question at the end about which characters you'd like to see receive short stories. And y'all, I love those short stories.\nOn my end, Square's survey prompted a flurry of frantic Discord and Slack messages urging everyone within direct messaging distance to go answer.

          "description": "In its latest Friday Facts blog post, Factorio developer Wube Software highlighted a major new feature coming to the Space Age expansion: Quality. In Factorio: Space Age, every Item, Entity, and Equipment will now have five possible qualities. The qualities use familiar names: Normal, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, and Legendary. Each successive quality after Normal increases the bonus you get from the higher tier quality. Uncommon will grant a 30% bonus, Rare a 60% bonus, Epic a 90% bonus, and Legendary a 150% bonus.\nThe intended goal of adding Quality to Factorio is to balance Horizontal versus Vertical growth in the core gameplay. In the current version, players have the challenge of building more mining outposts and production facilities—which is the Horizontal growth. But, also, have to consid…",

          "description": "Everything comes full circle as Jean-Claude Van Damme prepares to join the lineup of Mortal Kombat 1. The inspiration for Johnny Cage is now a skin for the character, and he's on display in a new trailer. Van Damme provided his likeness and voice for the skin, which lets him fire off quips with the klassic kast. \nAfter trading blows that make Bloodsport seem tame, Van Damme closes out the clip with a brutal finisher. It's only appropriate that said finisher is delivered to Johnny Cage. Quite the gruesome price to pay for a life in the copycat spotlight. The video is age-restricted on YouTube, so you'll need to click through to watch. \n[caption id=\"attachment_403105\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot via NetherRealm Studios[/caption]\nSplits Decision\nThe very existence of the Mortal Kombat series can be traced back to JCVD. Co-creator Ed Boon wanted a fighter with Van Damme at the center of it, but the action film star declined. Thus, the notoriously gory, original fighter that still has us all double-checking our spelling of combat was born.\nThe Jean-Claude Van Damme character skin for Johnny Cage will be available as part of the Kombat Pack. As previously detailed, you can get that pack in the Premium Edition and Kollector's Edition versions. Van Damme will be released alongside six new early access DLC characters, including Quan Chi, Ermac, Takeda Takahashi, Peacemaker, Omni-Man, and Homelander. There will also be five new Kameo Fighters, all of which will be available post-launch. The Van Damme skin will be usable at launch, so start practicing your splits now.\nMortal Kombat 1 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store on September 14, 2023.  \nThe post Jean-Claude Van Damme enters the ring in Mortal Kombat 1 trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

To celebrate, Nintendo is preparing to launch a truly contentious Splatfest — who among the members of Deep Cut would be the best leader? \nStarting at 5:00 p.m. PST / 8:00 p.m. EST on September 8 and extending through 5:00 p.m. PST / 8:00 p.m. EST on September 10, players must decide who would be the best leader: Shiver, Frye, or Big Man? It would seem as if the sides are evenly matched, at least based on the Twitter replies. “Who else is joining Team Big Man?” asked YouTuber Zack Scott, who received nearly 40 responses at the time of writing, all of which appealed for a different member of Deep Cut to take home the win. \nBut, it would appear some folks fear the possibility of the majority ignoring the prompt in favor of making this Splatfest more of a popularity contest. “Remember guys, the question isn't about who your favorite Deep Cut member is, it's about who would make for a better leader out of them,” said one user on Twitter. They go on to admit their preference for Big Man, while also admitting their opinion that none of them would make good leaders. And then you’ve got the users who make it no secret that they’re not a fan of any available option. “Worst possible theme they could've done,” said one user. \nIn any case, who are you rooting for in this anniversary Splatfest?

I was there when the Xbox 360 launched. It was a pretty exciting time when it came about. Then, the hardware issues started happening. This was commonly known as the “Red Ring of Death,” named because of the error code that was displayed on the light ring around the power button.\nThe issue was caused by components heating up then cooling off quickly, which would cause connectors within them to break. It apparently wasn’t caused specifically by the console reaching a high heat, but rather the rapid cooling afterward. Uh, wait. What were we talking about? Blocks?\nThe Xbox 360 Mega Building Kit has you construct the console itself, a controller, and a disc case for Halo 3. It even comes with a detachable hard drive. Isn’t that cute?\nIt’s interesting that this isn’t being done by Lego. No disrespect to Mega Bloks, but it’s hard to beat the prestige of the Lego brand. Nintendo had their NES immortalized, and Atari brought around a 2600 set.\nThe Microsoft Xbox 360 Collector MEGA Building Set is available for pre-order (if it isn’t sold out) for $149.99 USD.

There's a new rival called Trip who's going to have an interesting backstory. Although Sonic Superstars is ditching the pixel art style of Sonic Mania, it'll retain the gameplay of classic Sonic titles.\nhttps://twitter.com/sonic_hedgehog/status/1699814792448577813\nWith only weeks away from the game's release, Sega has revealed the music for the Pinball Carnival Zone. The track, which is composed by Rintaro Soma, is a smooth yet energetic tune featuring plenty of retro polyphonic beeps and a beat that's sure to get you pumped to go fast. This isn't the only music we've heard from Sonic Superstars, as we also got a snippet of the Bridge Island Zone's music in a gameplay stream from Sega.\n[caption id=\"attachment_403125\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Sega.[/caption]\nThe importance of music in Sonic\nIt's no mistake that a song reveal is being used to hype fans, as music has been an important part of the franchise's identity since its beginning.

Franchise fans will be familiar with this name, as he has worked on the music of a few series titles including Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and Sonic Heroes. He'll be assisted by Sonic Mania composer Tee Lopes, who has excitedly assured fans that Superstars will feature an even better soundtrack.\nSonic Superstars is scheduled to release on October 17 on Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.\nThe post Sega reveals new level music from Sonic Superstars appeared first on Destructoid.",

Nearly twelve years after Skyrim, the next installment is now finally said to be in the early stages of development. As such, Xbox head Phil Spencer has been asked whether the elusive RPG will be an Xbox exclusive.\nIn a recent interview with Bloomberg Technology, Spencer is asked a question about exclusivity. In particular, journalist Caroline Hyde is curious about what platforms The Elder Scrolls 6 may be on. Spencer answers by saying that the company looks at things \"on a case-by-case basis.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-yYmq35E3I&t=83s\nHe adds that Xbox wants to make sure that the games made by the studio are \"available in many different places.\" However, he specifically mentions the Xbox consoles, PC, and \"via cloud,\" with no mention of any other platforms.\nToo early to say, really\nIt kind of sounds like Spencer is circling the bit when it comes to The Elder Scrolls 6 and potential exclusivity. Consider that Starfield being an Xbox Series and PC game only seems to be working out nicely for the tech giant.\nAs such, it's not above the realm of possibility that Xbox may keep Skyrim's follow-up for its own platforms. However, we can't say for certain, but Spencer's response to the question does seem rather vague.\nAs for when it's actually coming out, speculations suggest it might be another five years until we see TES6. By that point, we'll be on the next generation of consoles anyway. Great.

Speedrunning is a huge part of the gaming community, and the iconic Nintendo game is close to having the perfect run.\nOver on YouTube, runner Niftski has set a new world record, beating Super Mario Bros. in just 4:54.631. Watching the challenge itself is quite spectacular, but if you're curious as to why they're so elated when they finish the game, it's due to how near-perfect the run was.\nhttps://youtu.be/Khu9BB2g4Ks\nYou see, according to Niftski, someone just needs to shave off 0.366 seconds (or 22 frames) for it to be the absolute fastest – the literal limit – anyone can beat the classic platformer. Until now, this time was deemed impossible for human hands. But now a \"new era\" has begun for the speedrunning community.\nHeart-pumping stuff\nAccording to GamesRadar, this particular run is impressive because of something called \"framerule.\" This is, as the report says, the \"hidden in-game timer that checks every 21 frames to see if you've completed a level.\"\nThere's a 45-minute breakdown of how this works from YouTuber Summoning Salt, if you're interested in learning more. Suffice it to say, Niftski's record sets a new bar for others who want that perfect speedrun.\nSpeedrun.com has validated this latest run, which puts it just 0.233 seconds ahead of second place. Things are only going to get tighter, and it's going to be interesting to see who can come along and essentially do a frame-perfect run of Mario.\nThe post Super Mario speedruns are close to perfection, as a new world record is achieved appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Facepunch Studios' brutal online survival game Rust has been going (and going) for years. Its punishing gameplay seems to entice the most sadistic of players, and updates continue to add to the world. Now, the most recent patch implements enough new stuff to match a Schwarzenegger flick.\nA recent video uploaded to the Rust/Facepunch YouTube channel gives a good idea of what you can expect the next time you log in. Among other things, the developer has now added an attack helicopter, which comes complete with a gunner seat. There's also a homing missile launcher to take down said helicopter, and also an armored hot air balloon because why not?\nhttps://youtu.be/gTKll4bk968\nOne other thing that's been included in this latest update is the weapon rack. As the name suggests, this gives you a handy place to store all those guns. And while you're at it, have some parachutes as well, which allow you to \"travel silently over long distances.\" More details about the new patch can be found on Steam.\nNot rusty yet\nIf you're a newcomer to Rust, you'll know how tough it is to make it through those first few days. When it's not the threat of starvation or the wildlife that's keen on gnawing your bones, it's the other players who are, quite frankly, trigger-happy.\nStill, it's worth it if you can thrive in this harsh environment. The game's been out for several years now – originally releasing to early access in 2013 – and Facepunch Studios seems only too keen to keep improving its survival IP. Plus, now you can literally \"Get to the choppa!\"\nThe post New Rust update has major ’80s action movie vibes appeared first on Destructoid.",

At the same time, it’s a new chapter in a long legacy that surrounds the interplay between the original tabletop RPG and the video gaming hobby. It’s a strange truth that, even as a video game, Baldur’s Gate 3 has emerged as one of the most potent arguments in years for trying out the actual D&D game at a table.\nWhen I was a kid growing up in the ‘80s, playing D&D was not something you would readily admit to. Beyond the open ridicule you might face from your peers, it had a genuine chance to get you barred from some of your friends’ homes. No joke. More than a few parents back then truly believed that D&D was tantamount to actual demon worship, and they wouldn’t want t…",

          "description": "Stray proved to be an unlikely phenomenon when it was released last July, and now the little kitty and its robotic pals are heading to the big screen. Publisher Annapurna has announced plans to develop an animated movie based on the hit indie game.\nPer Entertainment Weekly, Annapurna Animation, the company's new animated film division, is following up its debut feature, Nimona, with a film adaptation of the 2022 adventure game. It will be the first game in Annapurna Interactive’s roster of titles to get the cinematic treatment, and, according to the publisher, it won’t be the last. Annapurna has not revealed a director, cast, or release window for the Stray film. Annapurna Animation is led by former Disney Animation executives Robert Baird and Andrew Millstein. \n\"This is a game that's all about what makes us human, and there are no humans in it,\" Baird tells EW. \"It's a buddy comedy about a cat and a robot, and there's such a hilarious dynamic. So, there's comedy inherent in this, but there's not one human being in this movie. I think it's one of the reasons why the game was incredibly popular, that you are seeing the world through the point of view of an adorable cat. How did they pull that off, and how are we going to pull that off in the movie? We will, even though sometimes it feels impossible, but we know that's the essence of the game and the key to telling the story.\"\nStray was developed by French studio BlueTwelve. Taking place in a post-apocalyptic Earth devoid of humans, players control a cat who gets separated from its friends and sets out to find them. The cat's journey takes it through cities occupied by sentient robots, which it befriends along the way, namely a flying drone named B-12. Stray was among the most celebrated games of last year, winning Best Debut Indie at the Game Awards, and made its way to Xbox last month. You can read our review of Stray here. \n[Source: Entertainment Weekly]",

Boon’s discussion delves into his entry into the game industry, Netherrealm's decision-making process when selecting cross-over fighters, the studio's approach to storytelling, and other topics. Boon is one of, if not the first, video game developer to appear on the show, and watching him share his fighting game knowledge while simultaneously fighting for his life is an entertaining treat. \n\n\nDuring the discussion, we get the first clip of Johnny Cage's Jean-Claude Van Damme character skin, which you can see in the photos below.

A new trailer revealed the game’s new presentation and an October release date.\nGargoyles Remastered takes the 1995 game and repaints it with a coat of new enhanced visuals more faithful to the series (and you can instantly toggle between the new look and the classic 16-bit graphics). It also includes the usual bells and whistles for remastered Disney games, such as an instant rewind, wide-screen presentation, and achievements. The original soundtrack has also been remastered. Check out the game's first trailer below. \n\n\nIf you’re a Gargoyles fan looking to fight evil as Goliath and his friends again, you can pick up Gargoyles Remastered on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on October 19.",

However, E3's overseer the ESA has announced this partnership will not continue.\nAccording to GameIndustry.biz, the ESA and ReedPop have come to a mutual decision to part ways. On top of that, E3 2024, which is still planned to take place, will not be held at its traditional venue, the Los Angeles Convention Center. This had been previously reported by the city itself. There’s no word on where E3 will be held, but the site reports that the ESA is also looking to completely reinvent the show in 2025. \n“We appreciate ReedPop’s partnership over the past 14 months and support their ongoing efforts to bring industry and fans together through their various events,” said ESA president and CEO Stanley Pierre-Louis in a statement to GameIndustry.biz. “While the reach of E3 remains unmatched in our industry, we are continuing to explore how we can evolve it to best serve the video game industry and are evaluating every aspect of the event, from format to location. We are committed to our role as a convenor for the industry and look forward to sharing news about E3 in the coming months.”\nReedPop had been tasked with revamping this year’s ill-fated E3 after the show had collapsed over the last few years due to the pandemic and waning interest from publishers/developers. The 2023 edition fell through after Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft declined to attend alongside publishers such as Ubisoft and Sega. The last in-person E3 was in 2019, and outside of the online-only 2021 event, every subsequent E3 has been completely canceled. Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest has filled the void since then. \n[Source: GameIndustry.biz]",

          "description": "Mortal Kombat 1’s roster already has a few returning names from the series’ 3D era in the forms of Ashrah and Havik, and another long-lost favorite joins the fight. Nitara is making her long-awaited return, and it’s such a big homecoming that NetherRealm has enlisted actress Megan Fox to voice her.\nNitara is a vampire that made her debut in 2002’s Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance. She’s only been playable in a couple of entries, had a small cameo in Mortal Kombat 11, and appeared in the 2021 Mortal Kombat film. Despite having only a few appearances to her name, she’s endured as favorite among fans who grew up with the 2000s era, and she looks as deadly as ever in MK 1. \nMegan Fox brings Nitara to life, and you can get a sample of her performance in the trailer below. “I grew up playing Mortal Kombat and I can’t believe that I’m voicing a character in the new game,\" Fox says in a press release. \"It’s an honor to be a part of one of the greatest video game legacies of all time.” Given that Ronda Rousey voiced Sonya Blade in MK 11, it’s not surprising to see NetherRealm rope in another celebrity to perform one of its kombatants. \n\n\nMortal Kombat 1 launches on September 19 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Check out our latest hands-on impressions of its Invasions and Story Mode here. Be sure to also watch the game's most recent trailer from Gamescom 2023.",

As fans know, the best way to follow up a good TMNT project is to make a video game out of it, and that’s exactly what's happening next year. \nPublisher Outright Games, along with Paramount and Nickelodeon, have announced a new untitled TMNT game in development set within the Mutant Mayhem universe. It will feature the same striking visual design and follows a new story set months after the movie's events. There’s no word yet on if the film’s ensemble cast will reprise their roles.\nIn terms of gameplay, a press release only hints that the project involves “combining energetic ninja teamwork gameplay with a humorous narrative, players will take control of the Turtles as they interact with a host of memorable characters from the franchise and fight to save this stylized take on New York City from a new mutant threat.” Outright Games has experience working on games based on kid-friendly licenses, making titles based on Star Trek: Prodigy, How to Train Your Dragon, Paw Patrol, and Peppa Pig. \nThe TMNT: Mutant Mayhem game is targeting PC and consoles. It’s the latest project in what’s been quite a renaissance for the Turtles, especially in video games. The resurgence kicked off with last year’s well-received TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge, which recently got a big new expansion. The Cowabunga Collection bundled nearly every classic TMNT game into one package for a modern audience. A single-player action game based on the beloved TMNT: The Last Ronin graphic novel is also in the works.",

          "description": "The upcoming reimagining of Alone in the Dark is skipping Halloween this year. Instead of inviting players back to Derceto on October 25, the survival horror adventure will now arrive on January 16.\nIn a press release, developer Pieces Interactive offers a candid explanation for the move: it doesn’t want the game to compete with October’s heavy hitters like Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and another big horror game, Alan Wake 2. \n“Our intention is to avoid competing with the wake of Alan's epic release and to evade the dazzling skyline of cities adorned by the graceful swings of Spider-Man,\" Pieces writes. \"We aim to truly remain as Alone in the Dark as possible. To honor this, the spine-chilling horror game has been rescheduled to unveil its horrors on January 16th, 2024. This extension will serve a dual purpose: not only will it permit us to meticulously perfect the gaming experience, but it will also grant us the opportunity to fully immerse ourselves in the remarkable releases of October.”\nThe studio also released a new trailer starring David Harbour’s Edward Carnby, one of the game’s protagonists, showing off his performance and impressive facial capture. \n\n\nAlone in the Dark is a modernized revamp of the 1992 survival horror classic that stars actors Jodie Comer and David Harbour as protagonists Emily Hartwood and detective Edward Carnby, respectively. Players control one character to explore the haunted Derceto hospital to solve a sinister mystery, with both scenarios offering different story threads and moments. You can read our full preview of the game here. It will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

I saw, noticed, and felt things I hadn’t in any other, and it’s given me a new appreciation for Yu Suzuki and Sega’s AM2 development team.\nMore than anything else, Shenmue is a video game about how a real person in a real world inhabited by other real people experiences the death of a loved one and the loneliness that follows.\nIn the fall of 2020, my wife and I lost a baby…",

This time, however, he would the playable protagonist. His journey in Mirage takes him from street thief to Hidden Ones order initiate and eventually to the master assassin we see in Valhalla. \nBasim getting his own game is the first time in the franchise’s history that a character who already appeared in a different Assassin’s Creed gets their own mainline game as protagonist.

          "description": "Newcomer studio Sonka has released a new gameplay trailer for its horror game, Holstin. This new trailer reveals a fun twist on the game’s shooting mechanics and comes alongside word that there’s a demo now available on Steam. \nThe trailer is short, running less than a minute, but it showcases the game’s terrifying ambiance, throwback visual style, and zombie-like creatures that have seemingly infested the small 1990s Polish town Holstin is set in. It also highlights that parts of the game are playable as an isometric, third-person shooter like last year’s Signalis and as an over-the-shoulder third-person shooter like in Capcom’s recent Resident Evil remakes. \nCheck out the Holstin gameplay reveal trailer for yourself below: \n\n\n“A psychological survival horror game set in an eerie, isolated 90’s Polish town consumed by an ominous presence,” the Holstin Steam page reads. “You’ve come looking for answers, but everyone seems possessed by something foul. Explore the festering town, interrogate locals, and fight ungodly manifestations to get to the truth.” \nThere’s no release date in sight for Holstin, but you can try the game for yourself today through a demo available on Steam right now. \nHolstin is set to release one day on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.\nFor more scary games, read Game Informer’s list of the top 10 horror games to play right now, and then read our list of the top 25 horror games of all time after that.",

It’s the second action title from Gato Roboto developer Donksoft and we now know it’s coming on September 13. \nA new trailer provides a new look at Gunbrella’s explosive, retro-inspired action. Players control a woodsman seeking revenge for the death of his wife, with players using their weaponized umbrella to blast apart foes or as a platforming tool. For example, you can use the umbrella to glide, swing, or slide around levels, among other uses.\n\n\nWe went hands-on with Gunbrella’s Steam demo and walked away impressed.

I’m roughly 23 hours in, so I still have many galaxies ahead of me, but read Game Informer’s Starfield review for in-depth thoughts on the overall package. With years of build-up and anticipation, I, like many Bethesda Game Studios fans, let my imagination run wild with what this new open world RPG could be. Now that I’ve played a decent chunk of it, it’s quite different from the studios’ Elder Scrolls and Fallout series in some ways. Those two franchises are significantly more open world than Starfield. In fact, Starfield feels more like a great sci-fi theme park with exciting points of interests rather than an open world adventure. But players looking for a replica space-based Fallout or Elder Scrolls adventure might …",

Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign. Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. \nAfter 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.\nJoin editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up. \nPart 1 - Surpr-iced! \nPart 2 - Bringing The Smoke\nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

Thus, you no longer need to compile ScummVM yourself in order to add it to your iOS or iPadOS device. \nIf you want to help by testing this version, just follow this Testflight link and enroll yourself in the test program. This may require installing Apple’s Testflight app. You can find instructions on how to install games and how to play them on our documentation portal.\nWe truly appreciate your feedback. You can share your thoughts with the Testflight feedback feature, where you can attach screenshots and post detailed descriptions. Alternatively, you can use our bugtracker, e-mail us at ios@scummvm.org, or post on our Discord Server. Your help will let us eventually add ScummVM to the App Store.\n>",
