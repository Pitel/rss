This could well be a rating from Capcom's DS cult favourite, Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective. The publisher on the rating is 'Gamepia', which is the publishing company for Capcom in Korea.

          "description": "\"We will send unto them... only you.\".\nIt’s interesting to look back and see how first-person shooters have evolved since the days of Doom. What once used to be a genre focused more on the single-player experience of exploring levels and killing monsters slowly turned into something more focused on multiplayer experiences. In recent years, it feels like an older-school design philosophy has been cropping up more and more in smaller-scale shooter projects and the latest in this lineage is Prodeus. Developed by Bounding Box Games, a team made up of industry vets and Doom modders, this new 'boomer shooter' does a fantastic job of bringing back retro shooting carnage with some light modern touches.\nMuch like the genre predecessors, Prodeus is rather light on narrative. The premise places you in the role of a generic space marine on an asteroid that’s acting as the battleground between two warring factions of aliens. Or something like that. It doesn’t really matter; Prodeus is more interested in just pushing a one-man army’s worth of guns into your hands and prompting you to mag-dump everything that moves. Those of you who appreciated the somewhat heightened focus on story in the latest Doom or Wolfenstein reboots may be a bit disappointed here, then, but we promise that the raw thrill of combat will quickly make you forget you cared about who you’re playing as or what you’re fighting against.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

We've all been there at some point in our lives, painstakingly planning a grand day out only for it to absolutely tip it down on the day in question - and for the boy in Inasa Fujio's hour-long narrative game, it's a trip to the local theme park during his summer holidays that gets rained off. \nUnfortunately, his mum (sensibly) decides against taking him and his brother out in the oncoming storm, so now he's got to face a day stuck inside his grandma's house instead. FUN. Turns out, though, that there are still plenty of memories to be made in this small, cluttered space. All you need is a little imagination.\nRead more",

Its gorgeous art direction depicts a vibrant alien world that bubbles and throbs with bio-mechanical life, where spore clouds and fleshy organic tunnels live side by side with floating metal skulls and impenetrable thickets of wires and cables. It's a fascinating place that seems to morph and change with every passing map segment, calling to mind the animated techno gunge of Akira and Metropolis one minute, and the flowering brilliance of Alex Garland's Annihilation the next. Its roots sink deep, creating a world you'll want to explore every last nook and cranny of as you delve deeper into its underbelly to find out why you're here.\nBut Deadsuit, your android-like protagonist, makes for a slightly rusty-feeling companion at times, lacking the grace and elegance of Nintendo's Samus Aran, and the nimble dexterity of Team Cherry's nameless knight. It will tide you over until Silksong arrives, for sure, but it also never quite sings in the way you'd hope.\nRead more",

Many of my thoughts on Elden Ring have been positive, as I'm still awestruck by the quality and scope of its open world (among many other things). But I admitted I'd reached my exhaustion point, which abated briefly, then came back with full force by the end.\nHonestly, as much as I admire the game and its brilliance, I reckon it might be a bit too much for me. And as FromSoftware set the Soulslike standard, I find myself hoping that future Soulslikes don't get too caught up in trying to mimick Elden Ring.\nRead more",

So, in keeping with dream logic: You’ve played Signalis before, and you’ve never played anything like it. It lovingly adopts the trappings of PS1-era survival horror, and more importantly, it fully understands why those systems, aesthetics, tropes, and technical limits are so engaging. But it also presents and explores love and loss, freedom and manipulation, fear and trauma, in its own cruelly captivating way. It’s strange and familiar, gorgeous and horrible. It’s an absolute banger of a videogame, made all the more impressive by its indiest of indies price tag and two-person dev team.\nFundamentally, it's a love story. Things go bad for space technician Elster, but she made a promise she intends to keep. We’ll get back to this later. First up: Signalis excels at capturing the essence of survival horror - those juxtaposed feelings of possibility and unease that hit you entering a long hallway, flanked by doors, only to find all but two locked or malfunctioning. You’ll be back here soon enough, you know that. Probably with a new key. Maybe with a new gun. But there’s also a good chance things will have…changed, by then. A floor tile might reveal new horrors. You might have spent your last bullet. So, left or right? Or maybe back? You can only carry six items, after all.\nRead more",

In fact, it's overall pretty good, but too much of Bannerlord's design is exactly the same as it was in Warband, and the bulk of what's been added is extraneous strategy guff that doesn't meaningfully improve it at all.\nIn between leading your warband around its 2D map and stabbing dudes alongside your men in 3D battles, you can now make weapons by commandeering local workshops (I guess?) to break down and recombine spare swords. You can only do a few per day, so the pattern is to repeatedly click \"make charcoal\", then leave to rest your tired little arms and repeat. I could probably get a more ~optimal build~ by smithing a megasword, but the one I have already does what I need. You can’t equip your army, even though that was in the very ropey Freeman. The end result is another axe in a game where you'll discard hundreds of them. You can't do armour, a huge waste considering the variety available, and that you spend vastly more time seeing your outfits than looking at anyone's pommel.\nRead more",

There, you can find the 5800X for £235 when you use code AFF15 with some nifty extras: a 64GB Micro SD card and a code for Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves. \nThe way it works is pretty simple - you need to get your total basket over £250 for the AFF15 code to work. So, pick anything on the store that's more than £5.51, like this Micro SD card, add it to your basket alongside the 5800X, then use the AFF15 code to bring the price down to the £235 we quoted. The game code will come with your order, no opt-in necessary, from what we understand. \nRead more",

          "description": "Overwatch 2’s lead hero designer has revealed Blizzard are working on new support heroes for the game as one of their “long-term focuses”. The admission came as part of a response to players asking for more support characters in Overwatch 2, as there are currently only eight of them to pick from right now, versus the ten tanks and whopping 16 damage characters in its overall roster. It's not just the number of supports Blizzard have been thinking about either. Over the weekend, it also emerged the Overwatch 2 devs are sending out a survey to current players, with emphasis on the game’s store and the divisive battle pass introduced when the series went free to play. The developments follow on from hero balance changes being brought forward from season two to mid-November.\r\n\n \nRead more",

We seek out spooks even in the heat of summer, and know there's no better mid-winter warmer than a good ghost story. So what are we to do to make this occasion still feel special?\nI know common wisdom considers Halloween to be \"Goth Christmas\", but in my experience goths bloody love Christmas as much as the next person. They are, however, far more likely to be agnostic on the subject of Valentine's Day. Yes, I have spent far too long thinking about this, but I'm determined to stand by my conclusions, thereby dubbing this holiday \"Goth Valentine's\". Which leads me neatly into the purpose of this feature: games that let you date the monster.\nRead more",

That’s basically body horror.\nApparently ignorant of their products’ ability to frighten and maim, PC gaming hardware makers sometimes try to manufacture an imposing aura by giving them big, bad names. You’ve probably seen these already: keyboards named after swords, laptops christened as mythical animals and the like. But some go full spooky, consulting the Halloween kids’ costume pantheon of creatures and creepers. Is an eerie moniker enough to strike fear, even before it has the chance to cause minor injuries or force you into a tedious warranty replacement process? Let’s find out.\nRead more",

Too late now! Plus, witches are totally Halloween fodder - and they're one of my key trends for games at the moment. Video games are lousy with both current and upcoming witches these days.\nIt makes sense. They've already got brilliant marketing. Few Halloween-y sights are more iconic than a pointy hat, a black cat, and a sihouetted figure flying in front of the moon on a broomstick. The witches I've collected here are definitely going to get you in the pumpkin spirit, even if they manage to run through most other genres except horror... Look, Halloween is mostly about sweets and dressing up these days anyway (and by the way, I am livid that I've not got any parties to go to this year, because my hair is exactly the right length to do a perfect Carmy Berzatto costume).\nRead more",

          "description": "The original Butterfly Soup is named for its ending monologue. Its four main characters, Diya, Min-seo, Noelle, and Akarsha, use the liquefaction of a caterpillar inside a cocoon as a metaphor for the awkward teenage growing phase they’re all in. In the sequel, set a few months later, they find a butterfly with a crumpled wing. It’s a victim of a false spring, having emerged from its cocoon too early due to unseasonably warm weather. One of them worries that they are like the injured insect; forever marked by their early life. And it’s this that Butterfly Soup 2 digs into much more deeply than its predecessor.\nIf you’re not familiar with the original, Butterfly Soup is a visual novel about four Asian girls navigating high school in the late 2000s, playing baseball, and falling in love. On replaying it to get ready for this review, it made me cry at least twice and laugh out loud a bunch more. It’s pay what you want with no minimum price, and takes about 2-3 hours. I’m also going to spoil parts of it, so go play it already.\nRead more",

          "description": "Stress Level Zero's Boneworks was Half-life: Alyx before Half-Life: Alyx released. Released in December 2019, its combination of deeply tactile interactions with a campaign heavily inspired by Half-Life 2 represented a major step forward for VR experiences at the time. It had a fair few rough edges, and you needed a cast-iron stomach to play it, but for about four months it was the ambitious, all-encompassing VR experience that the medium had hitherto lacked.\nThen Half-Life: Alyx came around, raising the (crow)bar so high that you'd need to be Mr Fantastic or some sort of bird with hands to reach it. Which is partly why Bonelab, the newly released sequel to Boneworks, hasn't quite gelled with me in the way its older sibling did. Technologically, its still very impressive, and noodling around with its massive interactive potential remains undeniably fun. But it often feels like a lot of good ideas with too little connective tissue between them. It's also even less compromising on your physiology than Boneworks was, seemingly determined to make existing in VR as uncomfortable as possible.\nRead more",

A colossal T-Rex-esque machine with powerful legs, twisted metal horns, and artillery cannons strapped to its back, it loomed larger than any other enemy I'd seen so far in the game. My first thought as I crouched behind a nearby rock and surveyed its chromium splendour was: \"I am definitely not yet ready to fight this thing.\"\nMy second thought came quickly after the first, when my cover was blown by a nearby Watcher that immediately reared back and emitted a shrill noise that alerted the Thunderjaw to my presence. \"Oh shite.

It is a complicated, huge, and ponderous alien invasion simulator that constantly threatens to drop the other boot on you the entire time. Anything you do could be the butterfly whose little wingflaps eventually result in the obliteration of the planet. It is not a game to be powered through, but to be played and contemplated exclusively for a solid month.\nThat is its central weakness. But I think it had to be this way. Its commitment to an idea is demanding, but if you can tolerate some issues with clarity and presentation, the payoff for meeting it is utterly unique.\nRead more",

Who knows!\nTime to get your retro fingers a-clickin' as SNK has announced that it will release its pint-sized compendium Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection Vol 2 on PC and Nintendo Switch as soon as November 9.\nMuch like its predecessor, the Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection Vol. 2 will feature a fistful of games pulled from the archives of the publisher's misunderstood handheld console, which launched way back in 1999 but unfortunately struggled to find a mainstream audience, despite its solid technical design and library of fun and unique titles.\nhttps://twitter.com/SNKPofficial/status/1588350318395342848?s=20&t=A5PutVidqCwmn3rbvDPpZA\nSomewhat frustratingly, given the impending launch, SNK did not actually reveal the list of games that would be featured on the new volume. Hardcore SNK heads might be able to divulge the 10 lucky titles from the splash art, however, which appears to spotlight characters from titles such as Biomotor Unitron, Baseball Stars, Neo Geo Cup '98, Rockman Battle, Big Band Pro Wrestling, and the super cool SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash, among others. To be clear, this is educated speculation on my part.\nAs I've noted before, the NGPC console was genuinely unique and well-made handheld, which deserved a better fate than the one it received. Thus, it's wonderful to see this bespoke library of games archived for both current and future generations. When we have an official game list for Vol. 2, we will be sure to let you know. In the meantime, Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection Vol. 1 is available now on PC and Switch.\nNeo Geo Pocket Color Selection Vol. 2 launches November 9 on PC and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection Vol. 2 hits PC and Switch next week appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Kastov-74u ban has begun in Modern Warfare II\nIt always takes a few weeks to adjust after a new Call of Duty game comes out (or any online multiplayer game, really), including server issues, any outstanding bugs, and of course, balancing out any mechanics that might give players an advantage over others. Apparently, that's exactly the case with the Kastov-74u, which has been banned in pro tournaments lately. The gun is based on the real world AK-47 submachine gun, but in Modern Warfare II, it's actually classified as an assault rifle.\nBasically, the Kastov-74u rips through enemies at close range like a submachine gun, but also does well at mid-range, which makes it more akin to an assault rifle. While it's not unheard of for players to get creative with their loadouts and use guns for plays that they weren't originally intended for (close range quick-scoping with a sniper rifle being the most famous example of this), but the Kastov is missing the balance that makes for a fair fight, according to the pro players.\n\nThe bans started rolling in only three days after the professional season started in the first place -- if there's one thing we can always rely on, it's pro gamers optimizing a game in the shortest amount of time possible. As a casual Call of Duty player, it never ceases me to see how players can suss out the most powerful builds on what seems like intuition to me, but then again I guess that's why they're professionals at this.\nIn wake of the bans, streamer and pro Call of Duty player Swagg shared his favorite Kastov-74u loadout, which features the BR209 Barrel, Merc Foregrip Underbarrel, and the True-Tac Grip Rear Grip. It's a simple build, featuring only three out of a possible five attachments, but apparently adding too many of the Modern Warfare II attachments can hinder you more than they help you in some cases.\nThe post Pros are banning this Modern Warfare II gun in competitive play appeared first on Destructoid.",

The game was officially released on October 18th, so it's also pretty telling that it was able to surpass that number only a few weeks after its release, as well. The ann…",

          "description": "Friends who Snap together, stay together\nWhile Marvel Snap is quickly taking over phones, one particular feature that's missing is the ability to challenge friends. But that's going to change soon, as the team says a mode for playing against friends in Marvel Snap is arriving before the end of the year.\nSpeaking to The Washington Post, a spokesperson for developer Second Dinner confirms an update is on the way for this calendar year. Part of this update will be a \"friend-centric\" Battle Mode.\nThe Battle Mode was mentioned in an October roadmap update, as a different way of playin Snap. Rather than competing for Cosmic Cubes, player have health.\nMultiple matches are played out and players lose health like Cubes, with Snaps taking more health. This is a bit different from the current one-and-done ladder climbing mode.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNuq6E3enZQ\nSnap back\nThis is an interesting way of playing, and one I'm pretty interested in seeing. As much as I love the current version of Marvel Snap, the concept of playing out multiple matches and adapting to the opponent is a cool concept.\nObviously, using health rather than Cosmic Cube progression, means you can have a little bit of fun with it too. Maybe rather than worrying about certain decks or strats, you can just instant-Snap and roll out your gimmick decks.\nMarvel Snap has surged its way into the conversation in a serious way. Understandably so, as it's a seriously fun card game. It's nice to see the team at Second Dinner is still working at ways to keep things fresh, even as players are still working their way through card unlocks and the seasonal pass.\nThe post Marvel Snap will let you Snap against friends sometime this year appeared first on Destructoid.",

Aside from \"2023\", an expected arrival time was not announced.\nhttps://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/1587848321405980673?s=20&t=9lnlYBv3u1X06JUEVGYNoQ\nPosting on Twitter, Treyarch also confirmed that it was to start sunsetting League Play modes for previous entries Call of Duty: Vanguard and Call of Duty Black Ops: Cold War. Anyone looking to bag their last remaining ranked rewards for those titles needs to lock 'n' load, as the games' respective ranking will be shutting down on November 22. Of course, both titles will remain available to play online, (which is good as, incredibly, I'm still playing Black Ops Cold War on occasion.)\nWhile the delay in ranked play for Modern Warfare II is not ideal, it will likely not make a dent in the shooter sequel's incredible success. The new sequel is the biggest release in the CoD franchise's storied history, having pulled in over $800 million USD in its opening weekend while simultaneously smashing all concurrent player records for the franchise on Steam. Ranked Mode might still be some way away, but the community seems far too engaged in rat-a-tat-tat action right now to pay it much mind.\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare II is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post Modern Warfare II Ranked Mode won’t arrive until 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Both terms had been previously secured for use in Japan back in March of this year, and while all has been quiet in regard to any such game, these new, international filings would suggest that the project is still at the forefront of the developers' minds.\n\"Hotel Barcelona\" is, seemingly, a placeholder name for a project that Goichi \"Suda51\" Suda has wanted to develop alongside Swery65 for some time. The project was initially referenced during an IGN live stream back in 2019, where it came across as an improvised, pie-in-the-sky idea. Since then, however, various clues have pointed to the possibility that the game is, in fact, in development. Just last week, for example, a behind-the-scenes video shot at Suda's Grasshopper Manufacturer studio showed an artist working on some grotesque monsters.\nRegardless, both developers remain tight-lipped as to what Hotel Barcelona is, whether it is definitely in the works, or when we'll be hearing more about it. It's a tantalizing prospect, at any rate.

These will be updated on a weekly basis according to the tweet, running through December 6: when the promotion ends. You can get them from the Switch Online app at the very bottom of your home screen, but you'll need to play for them with Platinum Points (all of them so far are 10 points each).\nAs a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.\nThis week features a bonus array of points for playing Super Mario 64, Kirby 64, and Zelda: Majora's Mask on the N64 app: they'll grant you 100 Platinum Points each. The SNES bonus game is Panel de Pon, which is running in tandem with the 64 promos.

While the Mega Man series is mighty in terms of raw number of games, it doesn't always lead to mega sales. Mega Man 11 however, can be considered a success by nearly any metric. Especially after learning that it's taken the top spot overall in terms of overall sales. \"Best-selling Mega Man 11\" has kind of a ring to it, especially given the circumstances behind its release, and how it effortlessly swooped in and crushed Mighty No. 9.\nThe data comes directly from Capcom, who updated their sales figures over on their official site (thanks Nintendo Life!). If you scroll quite a ways down, all the way past tons of Monster Hunter, Street Fighter, Resident Evil, and Dead Rising entries, and even a few Onimusha titles (bring this series back!), you'll see Mega Man 11 at number 67 overall with 1.6 million in sales. That puts it above the previous champion, Mega Man 2, which sports 1.51 million in sales and helped kick off an empire.\nSo where's Mega Man 12? We can only hope it's in the works at some point, and builds on the foundation of everything Mega Man 11 was; but with feedback and enhancements.

          "description": "I hope this means Bambi isn't too far behind\nOne of the most enjoyable games of 2022 to play with a group of friends will soon get a lot more enjoyable. Not too long ago, Passion Republic Games announced it had secured a collaboration with the Godzilla brand for its party-brawler GigaBash. Details were scarce at first, but in the early hours of Godzilla Day–which marks the nationwide release of Godzilla/Gojira in 1954–the developers dropped a new teaser trailer giving fans their first look at the GigaBash Godzilla DLC.\nHe may be shrouded in shadows but that is the big green monster that's been saving and/or destroying cities since the '50s. As I stated in my review, GigaBash already has its own spin on Godzilla with the kaiju Rawa. But I have to imagine getting the big green is certainly a boon for the developers. I mean, he'll certainly make more sense here than he ever did in Warzone. Looking at his silhouette, I can't quite put my finger on which of the many different Godzilla costumes the character is modeled after, but it does seem to be taking cues from the Heisei era of the franchise.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5Iqm0z5WWk\nObviously, it's a brief look at the big green, but I can't wait for him to join the action. Godzilla stomps his way into GigaBash starting on December 9. [Update: According to a press release, Godzilla will actually be one of four characters that will join the game next month as DLC.]  GigaBash is now available for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.\nThe post GigaBash gets the King of Monsters in December appeared first on Destructoid.",

This time, there's a Slay the Spire board game in the works, and in all honesty, I'm not much of a board game person, but I am willing to be if it means I get to play a physical version of my favorite deckbuilding roguelike.\nApparently I somehow missed the announcement that Slay the Spire was getting a board game adaptation two years ago, but the Kickstarter page for the project is officially launched. So far they've raised over $1.5 million, and I don't really have any clue how much money it takes to make a board game, but that seems like a pretty substantial chunk of change in my book.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGfSp3Kz7rk\nThere are four pledge tiers ranging from $1 to $210 -- the lowest tier gets you access to updates and the Pledge Manager at the end of the campaign, the $100 tier gives you the base game, the $145 version gets you the base game plus some extras like character play mats and metal coins, and that fancy $210 version gets you the game and a whole bunch of extras, like the aforementioned mats, coins, and some beta art, among other things.\nThere are already some reviews of the board game up online, and with all the little bits and baubles (that I am bound to lose) it seems that the mechanics are a very faithful adaptation of what we're used to seeing in the video game. It looks to me like a pretty luxe purchase for collectors and fans of the game, so I'd probably suggest giving the original a few runs before playing if you haven't already.\nThe post A Kickstarter for the fancy Slay the Spire board game is live appeared first on Destructoid.",

And ahead of launch, Square Enix is detailing some updates it made to Harvestella after getting feedback from the demo.\nThe Harvestella Switch demo went live on the eShop following the September Nintendo Direct. Players had feedback from it, it seems, and Square Enix is making some tune-ups in a day one update for Harvestella.\nAs the studio outlines in a new blog entry, one major point is longer days. Time seemed to fly by a bit in the Harvestella Switch demo, so this should hopefully make it easier to do a bit more while the sun's up.\nCooldowns for job switching have been sped up, so it's easier to change up in combat. And the Mage class will also strike a bit faster than before. There's also more warning when your character is low on HP.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dd3U4jQFovk\nIn one of my favorite notes, Square says fishing is more fun. Specifically, the hit time has been reduced. But I like the general notion of fishing being more entertaining.\nThe Harvestella day one update has also received some bug fixes, a new UI for saving and loading, and partially reduced load times. These are all coming in a day one update to Harvestella itself, but the demo will not be updated.\nHome on the fantasy range\nThese all sound like solid tune-ups for Square Enix's fantasy farming adventure. Harvestella is the RPG company's take on farming life, a genre that's been seeing quite the resurgence.\nThe demo feedback route has worked out well for Square Enix in the past. Specifically, Triangle Strategy made a good few changes and tune-ups between its demo and launch that ultimately felt for the better.\nWe'll know soon enough whether the same has been done for this farming RPG. Harvestella goes live for Nintendo Switch and PC via Steam this Friday, November 4.\nThe post Harvestella day one update takes aim at demo feedback appeared first on Destructoid.",

Taking up control of one of many factions from the Dune universe, players compete for control of the planet and its lucrative \"spice\" reserve — a plant that forms the root of incredible powers, from extended human life to interstellar travel.

The new game received a major update this past summer, adding dedicated multiplayer servers, peer-to-peer support, new regions, events, and factions.\nHeartbreakingly, There's no sign of Kyle Maclachlan, Batista, or Rebecca Ferguson, but Dune: Spice Wars still looks like a very fine time for ruthless, intergalactic entrepreneurs everywhere.\nThe post Dune: Spice Wars is bringing its sci-fi strategy to PC Game Pass appeared first on Destructoid.",

Well, at least until something goes wrong and the robots, well, turn on them.\nNow, mutated robots are turning on their creators, and your protagonist Major P-3 is sent in to \"minimize consequences\" and secure classified info.\nIt looks like this plays out in a very frenetic manner, as your newfound robotic foes are pretty lethal. So Major P-3 gets some tools of their own, wielding powers through a special glove to wreak havoc.\nAtomic Heart has had my eye for a while, both for the influences its drawing on and the incredible art style Mundfish is crafting.

Not only has the rat-a-tat-tat sequel beat out the Call of Duty franchise's own launch record — previously held by 2011's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 — but MWII has also surpassed the combined opening box office revenue of blockbuster movies Top Gun: Maverick and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.\nhttps://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status…",

Forever Entertainment is also working on remakes of Front Mission 2 and 3. The former is set for 2023, while the latter is just arriving sometime in the future.\nA new gameplay trailer for Front Mission 1st: Remake is arriving soon, too. The video will premiere less than 24 hours from this writing, on November 3. You can find it below when it's live:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvj7WerPPF8\nMecha tactics are back in season\nFront Mission is a piece of Square's history that is exciting to see return. The strategic maneuvering of Wanzers around environments and big mech management makes it stand out a bit from the PlayStation 1 era of RPGs.\nIt's been a tactics-heavy year, too. Triangle Strategy started the year off strong, Tactics Ogre: Reborn is right around the corner, and a new Fire Emblem is just a few months away.\nWith three remakes currently set out, Front Mission 1st: Remake will get to set the tone for what's to come with these updated Front Mission titles. But hopefully it turns out strong. Front Mission is a neat series I've wanted to go back to for a while. Making these entries easily accessible, and putting them on the Switch at that, seems like a worthy endeavor.\nFront Mission 1st: Remake hits Nintendo Switch on November 30.\n \nThe post Front Mission 1st: Remake rolls out on November 30 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "CAUTION\nBack in the day, folks used to rotate their palm on their Nintendo 64 controllers for Mario Party minigames, leading to injuries, and an official \"glove\" release from Nintendo. This time with the Mario Party 64 Switch re-releases (Mario Party 1 and 2) via the expansion pack, they're just adding that warning upfront.\nHere's the warning in full for the first game, seen when booting it up:\n\"CAUTION: To avoid irritation to your skin and/or damage to the control stick, do not rotate it with the palm of your hand. Rotate the control stick with your thumb or by holding it between your thumb and forefinger.\"\n\nThe wild thing about this is that I always won these minigames, and never used my palm. Same thing with the button-mashing contests! Mario Party has caused a lot of folks strife over the past few decades, and this warning caused all those memories to come flooding back.\nHere's two of my most memorable Mario Party experiences:\nSomeone refused to play minigames when they were on my team so that I would get less coins\nAfter losing Totem Pole Pound, someone threw their controller across the room, which hit the N64 and froze the game\nFun times! On the flipside, I've played with a lot of good sports, and will continue to do so with these re-releases. Some of these original minigames just can't be beat, despite numerous attempts to bring them back from the dead in a new flavor.\nThe post The original Mario Party 64 Switch re-release has a palm injury warning appeared first on Destructoid.",

The set includes a PSVR2 headset, controllers, and stereo headphones.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5L9Mvh7tAk\nAlternately, a Horizon: Call of the Mountain bundle will include the above set complete with a download code for an additional $50/£40/€50. Developed by Firesprite and Guerilla Games, Call of the Mountain is, as you would expect, a VR adventure set within the beautiful, but highly hazardous, futureworld explored in acclaimed adventures Horizon Zero Dawn (2017) and Horizon Forbidden West (2022). The PSVR2 system will have its own library of titles and is not compatible with previous PSVR releases.\nIf you're interested in picking up the flashy new technology which, to my knowledge, doesn't play Dactyl Nightmare, then pre-orders go live on the official PlayStation Direct store on November 15. SIE hints that not all orders will necessarily be served on launch day, with kits rolling out throughout the last week of February and into early March. For more details, visit the official PlayStation Blog.\nThese prices put the PS5 and PSVR2 kit somewhere in the region of $1000/£1000.

          "description": "Ubisoft has rolled out its post-launch content roadmap for Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. Owners of the game’s season pass, whether purchased separately for $29.99 or bundled in the game’s $89.99 Gold Edition, have three big adventures aimed at keeping them glued to the game throughout 2023. \nIt all kicks off early next year with the first expansion, Tower of Doooom (their spelling, not mine). This introduces a new combat mode where the team must fight their way up Madame Bwahstrella’s multi-story tower to rescue Spawny, the visor-rocking Rabbid from Kingdom Battle. What’s important to note is that Tower of Doooom will be exclusive to the season pass, meaning you’ll be unable to purchase it separately. \nThe second untitled DLC arrives in mid-2023. So far, we only know it takes players to a new planet, features never-before-seen enemies, allies, and secrets, and stars a new antagonist. Finally, Rayman crashes the party in the final expansion to close out the year. Ubisoft’s limbless hero joins Rabbid Peach and Rabbid Mario on a separate adventure in a new location. Unlike Tower of Doooom, the second and third expansions can be purchased a la carte. \nI enjoyed Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope quite a bit, awarding it a 9 out of 10. In my review, which you can read here, I wrote that the game “builds upon Kingdom Battle’s foundation with smart tweaks and fun additions to emerge as a better game in every way.”",

          "description": "Atomic Heart, the BioShock-esque shooter set in an alternate reality's Soviet Union, will be released this February. \nMore specifically, the game will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 21, 2023. Developer Mundfish and publisher Focus Entertainment announced this news in a new and bloody gameplay trailer showcasing more of what to expect in the game early next year. \nCheck out the Atomic Heart release date trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Atomic Heart continues to look great in trailers and I can't wait to finally go hands-on with it in just four months, especially as a fan of BioShock. While Atomic Heart is doing its own thing, it's hard not to compare it to the BioShock series given the whole alternate reality thing, the types of guns on display here, the enemies we'll be facing, and the hand-controlled powers. \nAtomic Heart was revealed years ago, and there are plenty more trailers to watch if you're interested. Check out this 2020 gameplay trailer for an early look at the game, and then watch this 2021 trailer for a look at the creepier side of Atomic Heart. Find out why it's one of our most anticipated horror games after that, and then watch this action-packed combat trailer from earlier this summer. \nFor additional information about Atomic Heart, be sure to check out Mundfish's official website, where there's info about the game's different editions available for preorder and more. \nAre you excited about Atomic Heart?

          "description": "According to a Bloomberg report, video game publisher Embracer has shut down Onoma, the studio formerly known as Square Enix Montreal, just months after its acquisition. Some staff will be transferred to Eidos Montreal, another studio owned by Embracer. This news comes just a few weeks after Onoma underwent a rebranding process where it adopted the new name.\nOnoma was best known for its work on the Go series, turn-based spin-offs of popular Eidos Interactive titles designed for mobile. This includes Hitman Go, Lara Croft Go, and Deus Ex Go. Their most recent work was Tomb Raider Reloaded, which came to mobile devices earlier this year, and their future plans involved a title based on Avatar: The Last Airbender.\nEarlier this year, Onoma was just one part of a much larger series of Embracer’s acquisitions, which included Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal. In August, Embracer proceeded to acquire Limited Run Games, Tripwire Interactive, Tuxedo Labs, the IP rights to The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, and several more studios.\nThe Bloomberg report also says that the closure is part of a cost-cutting initiative, and that Eidos Montreal will have projects scaled back and cut as well. Some of these resources will be redirected to assist in the development of a game in the Fable franchise, led by Playground Games.\n[Source: Bloomberg]\nWere you a fan of the Go series? Do you think acquisitions are good for the games industry? Let us know in the comments.",

          "description": "The official Sonic the Hedgehog YouTube channel has uploaded an animated short titled “Sonic Frontiers Prologue: Divergence.” Starring Knuckles, the short reveals how he wound up on the island players explore in Sonic Frontiers. You can watch the six-minute animation in its entirety below.\n\n\nIn the trailer, Knuckles provides a voice-over explanation of his background up until now, including the fact that he was tasked with guarding the Master Emerald, a relic that hasn’t appeared in the Sonic series for quite some time. The trailer ends with Knuckles absolutely demolishing some robots, and while we’ve received no indication that he will be playable in Sonic Frontiers, that sequence makes me hope he will be.\nKnuckles has been a core Sonic character for most of the franchise’s existence, so it’s not surprising that he’s making an appearance in the blue blur’s latest adventure. While this animated prologue gives us insight into how he wound up on the island, it’s still not entirely clear why, especially when it comes to the appearance of Sage (a new character introduced in Sonic Frontiers) at the end of the trailer. We’ll have to wait for the full game to find out.\nThe past month has been full of Sonic news. We got a December 14 release date for Sonic Prime, Sonic Frontiers got a trailer confirming Super Sonic would be playable in the game, and we learned that the Sonic series has sold over 1.5 billion copies worldwide. For more Sonic news, check out our cover story from earlier this year, and stay tuned for more Sonic Frontiers coverage when the game releases on November 8.",

The news was announced through a blog post on the Spry Fox website, which also answers some questions about the future of the studio.\nSpry Fox says the partnership will not change any of their upcoming plans, meaning that Cozy Grove 2 and their unnamed non-violent MMO will still be developed as planned. Instead, Netflix will provide them with financial support, which Spry Fox says will allow them to “stop stressing” about how their games will generate profit. Despite all of Netflix’s current games existing through their mobile app, the blog post does not mention anything about platform exclusivity.\nSpry Fox joins five other in-house game developers at Netflix: Next Games (Stranger Things: Puzzle Tales), Night School Studio (Oxenfree), Boss Fight Entertainment (Dungeon Boss), and two internal studios in Helsinki, Finland and southern California.\nNetflix launched its games collection just over a year ago, in November of 2021. Currently, subscribers can play over 30 games on their mobile app, including Into the Breach, Spiritfarer, and Poinpy. On top of that, Netflix has over 50 more games in development.

That was a vaguely defined arrangement at the time, but we now know the partnership will produce a minimum of three titles.\nEA announced the news in a press release, with the publisher describing it as a “long-term” deal that could extend beyond three games based on the wording. The release also specifies these titles will be action-adventure games for consoles and PC, each featuring original stories in the Marvel universe. \nIt's worth clarifying that EA is not getting exclusive rights to Marvel like it had with Star Wars. There are multiple Marvel games in the works at various studios, including the recently announced Captain America/Black Panther game from Amy Hennig’s Skydance New Media. \n“We have been long-time fans of Marvel and their impressive leadership, so this is a remarkable moment for our developers as well as our players and fans,” said EA COO Laura Miele. “We look forward to welcoming Marvel into the EA family of creators and know this collaboration will produce exceptional experiences for our players. We can’t wait to see players' reactions when they suit up as Iron Man and do the extraordinary things this Super Hero is known for.”\nWe’re curious to learn what other Marvel projects are on the docket and which EA studios are behind them. Motive’s Iron Man, a single-player third-person action game, is currently in pre-production, so it’s a long way from release (the team is also making the Dead Space remake).

          "description": "Remember Mewgenics? The wacky cat-breeding roguelike is the brainchild of Super Meat Boy co-creator and The Binding of Isaac mastermind Edmund McMillen and has been in and out of the works for a decade. After being announced, put on hold, and restarted, it appears to have a new release window. \nMcMillen tweeted a gif of two of the game’s adorable cats engaging in what we'll call an intimate cat exercise. The tweet links to the game’s Steam page, which lists a 2024 release window.\nHold on to your Butts!https://t.co/wDBOizNXGl pic.twitter.com/MESXJFFXsh\nOctober 28, 2022\nWhat the heck is Mewgenics? The game tasks players with collecting and breeding hundreds of cats to train and send into battle. Or, as the Steam description puts it, Mewgenics is a “turn-based legacy roguelike draft sim about cats!” The game apparently boasts “100s of hours” of gameplay, multiple classes with over 50 unique abilities, over 200 enemies, and other features. \nMewgenics was first announced in 2012, with McMillen at the time describing it as \"By far the strangest project I've ever worked on.” McMillen has worked on it alongside Tyler Glaiel; the pair previously partnered for The End is Nigh, among other titles. The game was originally billed as a cross between Pokémon, The Sims, and Animal Crossing, and had first been planned to release in 2014. It was, of course, delayed, and its development was put on indefinite hold in 2016 when McMillen began work on The Legend of Bum-Bo, which launched in 2019. At the time, McMillen was unsure of Mewgenics’ future, but in 2018 he announced he was remaking the game to be released in “a few years.” \nThe game is slated to launch for PC, though whether or not it’s still coming to iOS is unknown. Are you still interested in Mewgenics? Let us know in the comments! For more on Edmund McMillen, we spoke with him last December where he discussed his life and career, including Mewgenics, which you can read in this interview feature.",

Silver Tempest stars Alolan Vulpix on the key art, but monsters like Lugia, Serperior, Ho-Oh, and Mawile share the spotlight. Meanwhile, players can expect cards starring Regieleki and Regidrago.\nThe Pokémon Company sent us several booster packs so we could open them and see what we pull. While it may just be dumb luck, I feel like this expansion gave me better pulls than any others in recent memory. As I cracked these open, I was met with several attractive full-art cards, as well as some gorgeous Trainer Gallery cards. I even managed to pull two of the three new Radiant Pokémon cards. \nThis expansion adds over 190 cards to the ever-growing library of Pokémon cards. That number includes 6 Pokémon VSTAR cards, 15 Pokémon V cards, 1 Pokémon VMAX card, 30 special art Trainer Gallery cards, and more than 15 Trainer cards. You can see my favorite pulls from this expansion below.\n\nPokémon Trading Card Game: Sword and Shield – Silver Tempest launches on November 11. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking on the banner below!",

To my surprise, this month saw the release of a game that fits both of these criteria: Marvel Snap.

As you play, you collect cards adorned with Marvel characters, each with a unique ability.

The name shares the same initials as P.T., which I can’t imagine is coincidental. Players explore a series of video files as they control a person searching for their lost dog, Teddy.

The game arrives on November 15. \nThe experience comes from Jumpship, a studio founded by Dino Patti, former CEO of Limbo and Inside developer Playdead. That shared DNA is evident in Somerville’s somber, surreal atmosphere. The game centers on a rural family – a father, mother, and child – whose lives get turned upside down by a cataclysmic event involving extraterrestrial visitors. The journey unfolds as a side-scrolling adventure game where the family must survive this apocalypse as it rips through small towns and beyond. You can watch the most recent trailer below.\n\n\nSomerville was first unveiled during E3 2021 and most recently popped up during last December's Game Awards. The game will be available on Xbox consoles (including Game Pass) and PC.",

          "description": "Rieko Kodama, the pioneering Sega developer behind titles like Phantasy Star and Skies of Arcadia, has died at 58. \nNick Thorpe, features editor for Retro Gaming Magazine, noticed that in the credits for Sega's Mega Drive Mini II, there's a message that reads, \"In memory of Rieko Kodama.\" Twitter user Ares Arcadia quote-tweeted Thorpe's tweet to ask Sega producer Yosuke Okunari if this message means that Kodama had died to which Okunari replied and said, \"As you understand it. We respected her,\" confirming her death. \nSega has since confirmed Kodama's death, citing that she had passed in May, according to IGN. Further details around her death will not be shared out of respect for her family's privacy, Sega says. \n\"We pray that the deceased will rest in peace, and we offer our gratitude for her enormous contributions to Sega,\" Sega of Japan says, as translated by IGN Japan. \nKodama's journey through game development began in the 1980s when she started as a graphic designer for Master System and Sega Genesis games like Altered Beast and Sonic the Hedgehog. She was the main artist for Phantasy Star and continued to work on the series' visuals team until Phantasy Star IV: The End of the Millennium, which she directed.\nOther credits include Mega Drive versions of Sorcerian, Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and more. After directing Phantasy Star IV, she directed Magic Knight Rayearth in 1995 before becoming a producer and development lead on Sega's Skies of Arcadia. She continued to work in games development in some capacity until at least 2018, where she was the lead producer on the Sega compilation title Sega Ages. \nIn 2019, she was recognized with the Pioneer Award at GDC 2019. \nThe staff at Game Informer extends their condolences to Kodama's family.",

Spawned in 2007 by Capcom veterans, including Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami and Devil May Cry and Okami mastermind Hideki Kamiya, the studio became a haven for these minds to create new franchises under the freedom of independence. Early success like MadWorld turned heads, but Platinum’s third title, Bayonetta, cemented it as one of the game industry’s premier action studios.\nLaunching in Japan in 2009 and hitting U.S. shores in 2010, Bayonetta revamped and, in some ways, improved the stylish action of its spiritual predecessor, Devil May Cry. The bewitching adventure reinvented and reinvigorated the stylish action genre; Platinum created its magnum opus in only two years. Unfortunately, sales didn’t match the reception, and Sega, the game’s original publisher, passed on a sequel. Despite fans’ cries, Bayonetta seemingly ended the series before it could take off.\nNintendo stepped up to answer those pleas by agreeing to publish a follow-up. Bayonetta 2 arrived in 2014 as a Wii U exclusive. The sequel proved Bayonetta wasn’t a one-hit wonder, becoming one of the year’s best games with some fans believing it surpassed its predecessor. The success also proved the family-friendly Nintendo had no problem letting the franchise remain true to its Mature-rated self.\nRead more...",
