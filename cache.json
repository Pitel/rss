I’m usually a lot more suspicious of hardware leaks, which are often just out-of-date or otherwise inaccurate info, but I’ve also sat through enough mic-muted prebriefings to know an official slideshow when I see one, and that appears to be exactly what Videocardz got its hands on. Besides, these specs include a gigantic 80Whr battery upgrade (doubling the ROG Ally’s 40Whr capacity), so we can at least file this under \"News James wants to be true.\"\nRead more",

Innocent times and places like the prologue for Baldur's Gate, which unfolds in the vast, fortified monastery of Candlekeep (beware spoilers from this point on).\nBioWare's first ever RPG opens with your unsuspecting Chosen One learning the ropes from the old sage Gorion. There are fetchquests that take you around the enormous citadel, bits of combat training to do, cosy formative chinwags to have with characters like your childhood friend Imoen. But it's not to last, of course: Gorion is murdered, and you must rove the Sword Coast in pursuit of his killer. When you return to Candlekeep later in the game, this once-proud bastion of learning has been filled with doppelgangers of Gorion and other acquaintances, a parade of chatbots waiting to stab you in the back.\r\n \nRead more",

The kind that probably has twelve artists dedicated to the recreation of visible pores, that sort of thing. It’s so focused on looking pretty that it hasn’t even noticed the title and subtitle got mixed up.\nSure enough, Hellblade 2 is a harsh test for older hardware, with a heavy reliance on DLSS or FSR upscaling to keep performance sweet. That said, it’s no Dragons Dogma 2-style technical horrorshow either. A happy balance of visuals and smoothness is attainable on plush PCs and low-end laptops alike, while DLSS 3 frame generation can deliver an effective kick in the framerate pants on RTX 40 series GPUs.\nRead more",

That's why the latest free update excites me so, as it introduces an artifact that makes chests malicious and another that lets you hatch angry lizard companions.

The first Prison Architect allowed you to finesse every detail of a secure correctional facility, down to each cell and dog kennel. Unsurprisingly for a sim about prison, it encouraged obsessive control. The 3D-ified sequel isn't finished yet, but it's taking a similar approach. Maybe a little too similar.\nRead more",

Lorelei, despite its single-solution puzzles, is not dictatorial. It’s far too interested in collaborating with you for that. It wants you to observe, consider, and interpret its many mysteries. What’s really hooked me here is how those puzzles are kept coherent and logical, despite you getting delivered a letter by dog and occasionally visiting a floppy disk bizzaro world where you converse with a magician who manifests from his own discarded hat.\nRead more",

          "description": "I've clocked up nearly 400 hours playing BioWare's big fantasy RPG Dragon Age: Inquisition, which is not a stat I'm particularly proud of. I'm not ashamed either, partly because, as has been identified by artist Corey Brickley, via the Maw, there's a lot of filler. Brickley has collated a list of suggested mods to slim down Dragon Age: Inquisition from a potentially 80 hours-long epic to a trim 40 hour story-focused romp, which means you might be able to play through it again in time for the launch of Dragon Age: Dreadwolf - which is a direct sequel to Inquisition.\nI find this list of mods interesting! It's a way to change the game quite substantially without exactly transforming it, and it's very in-keeping with my campaign to make games 60% smaller. Still, there's at least one item on there I'd push back on, but also this isn't really a new problem for Dragon Age as a series.\nRead more",

Sure, you’re saving physical currency, but at what price in terms of that most treasured and least tradeable of commodities, time? In the hours it takes to properly clean out a 4X game, you could probably build an empire yourself. OK, not a huge empire. An empire the size of the Vatican or the Principality of Sealand, perhaps. Maybe an empire that only covers the distance between your desk and your fridge. But an empire nonetheless.

Easily doable, for most aspiring galactic admirals.\nOnce a battle gets underway, however, Homeworld 3’s performance can start tanking, turning an initially smooth engagement into a more stutter-prone light show.

You can more than double your framerates with a relatively small handful of graphics setting changes, even if some these (including the DLSS and FSR 2 upscalers) can be a tad inconsistent in their own right.\nRead more",

No, it also spelled the end of us being able to witness something impossible to replicate, a 'game' of badminton uniquely his.

          "description": "Wayfinder, currently a free-to-play RPG developed by Airship Syndicate, is undergoing a pretty drastic change in its upcoming Echoes patch. Right now it's a live-service game with microtransactions, but soon it'll continue as a paid co-op RPG with no in-game monetisation. And that's alongside promised tweaks to how progression works, too. Huh. It's often you see paid games go free-to-play, but this is an unexpected switcheroo.\nRead more",

Yesterday saw the release of an update to the base game's swimwear, kicking off the updates teased in the recently-revealed new roadmap, Season Of Love. The roadmap video's vibe is that it and its partner saw you from across the bar and wondered if you'd be interested in joining them, and it kind of weirds me out.\nRead more",

The Musk era has transformed what was already fondly known as a hellsite into something at once more obnoxious and sadder, whether you're talking about the web3 grifters or the resurgent debate-me cryptofascists or the recommendation algorithm's perceptibly greater enthusiasm for quote-tweet flamebait.\nStill, there are lights in the darkness. Yesterday, Graham pointed us towards a thread started by The End Is Nigh developer Tyler Glaiel in which he challenged other developers to \"take a short break, pick a number in your code or data files, multiply it by 1000, and post the results\". Other developers have heeded the call. Here's a round-up of the results that doubles as a watery echo of Alice0's (RPS in peace) old Screenshot Saturday Monday features.\n Read more",

I really want to use the word ‘zany’ without irony here to describe its hand-drawn 2D style and animations, but I’m afraid that ship has long since sailed into the sun. I’ll go with ‘caffeinated’ I think. Like the Adult Swim cartoons it reminded me of, it’s got a sense of the sardonic and a penchant for violence, but still comes from a place of having recently devoured several bowls of suspiciously colorful cereal. Anyways, forget all that. I mentioned an FPS in the title, so I must assume you’re here for the violence.\n \nRead more",

It got stuck in time following a few delays but it's finally defrosted now. The sharper look will appeal to pixel perfectionists, but there are also 40 new levels for serial rewinders.

Sadly, my computer is incapable of producing smells beyond a faint reek of encrusted pasta sauce and regret, but if it did, I imagine I'd even now be basking in the aroma of burning bone and feather, because that is what the 10 new creatures you'll meet in the Ashlands consist of, broadly.

          "description": "Wuthering Waves has turned out to be a pretty solid addition to the gacha game lineup, sporting an intense combat system and a solid amount of power systems and collection mechanics that have kept me playing over its first few days. Still, like many game releases, not everything has gone smoothly, and the first few days since release have been plagued with issues.\n\n\nKuro Games has been working hard to correct many of these issues, and some patches have already started to roll out. To further apologize for the rough start, Kuro Games has also been handing out some goodies to players. The most anticipated of these is a voucher for a free basic 5-star unit.\n\n\n\n\nHow Do You Get the Free 5-star Voucher?\n\n\nGetting the voucher is as simple as opening the mail. \n\n\nA letter will be sent to your mailbox, containing an item called the Voucher of Reciprocal Tides. Once you have acquired your item, simply go to the banners page and there will be an option to exchange the voucher for a basic 5-star unit. The units available are as follows: \n\n\n\nVerina\n\n\nEncore\n\n\nLingyang\n\n\nJianxin\n\n\nCalcharo\n\n\n\nPlayers can also choose a 5-star they already own to get a node unlock on the character's Resonance Chain.\n\n\nPlayers don't have to make the decision immediately, as the voucher is good through May 22, 2025. That said, for new or free-to-play players the free pull is more than worth using ASAP. I suggest pulling Verina to get the best-in-class support in the game, or Calcharo for very solid DPS, but each player is free to make a decision that best fits their party needs. \n\n\nPlayers will also receive 10 free Radiant Tides if they have reached Union Level 2 or higher, allowing them to roll for more chances at Jiyan. Between the free 5-star, these rolls, and the rest of the Lustrous Tides players receive throughout the game, no one should have trouble getting a solid team together for their journey in Wuthering Waves. \n\nThe post Wuthering Waves players can claim a free 5-star character for launch troubles appeared first on Destructoid.",

It does not matter if you choose to play it as a Free Roam objective or through a Bounty. \n\n\nOnce here, you’ll notice these broken-down spires that have the symbols that you can see on Requiem mods.

However, there will be at least three you can find if you follow this map. \n\n\nYou can also find a few, go back to the Necralisk or your Orbiter, then go again. But that can be a waste of time with all the loading screens. The time cycle in the Cambion Drift doesn’t mean anything either. The Obelisks can spawn at any time.\n\n\nYou can also find these Obelisks underground when taking on the Isolation Vault bounties. These count toward the weekly challenge, too. \n\n\nHow to activate a Requiem Obelisk\n\n\nTo activate a Requiem Obelisk, you need to unlock your Operator or Drifter. With either one of them, use their respective weapon and shoot at the Obelisk. You can also use a fully-built amp for this to work as long as it deals Void damage. \n\n\nIf done correctly, the Obelisk should reconstruct itself and attract a mob of Infested enemies. Upon the tower coming together, you should make progress in completing this Nightwave challenge. Do this three times, and the 4,500 Nightwave standing is all yours. \n\nThe post How to activate a Requiem Obelisk in Warframe: Locations and more appeared first on Destructoid.",

You've got until Monday, June 3 at 10 a.m. PT to choose from what I would say is a pretty good list of titles.\n\n\n\n\nTake a quick look on the sales page to see for yourself. Want 30% off Sons of the Forest? Of course you do. How about 33% off Project Zomboid? An odd number, but sure! Or maybe you want to get Stranded Deep, Valheim, or Subnautica for 50% off each. Even Palworld is there, at 10% off the regular asking price.\n\n\nSummer lovin'\n\n\nThese events seem to come around more often these days. However, we're not quite at the big Steam Summer Sale just yet. That begins in a few weeks. You can keep an eye on the SteamDB countdown if you really want to see exactly when it's scheduled to begin.\n\n\nCrafting and survival games feel like they shouldn't be as popular as they are. But as we can see here, there are still so many offerings, largely from more independent studios. A lot of them are pretty decent as well, in my experience.\n\n\nThere are definitely more than a few in the sale that I'm keen to try out; Sons of the Forest, Project Zomboid, maybe even Enshrouded.

There are some really interesting tidbits about this game, mind: firstly, even though it is being published by Ubisoft, Rogue Prince does not necessitate a Ubisoft Connect login.

          "description": "Are you thrilled about the possibility of a new Doom game? If you've clicked on this article, chances are good you're pretty pumped. There have been rumors about a new reveal for a bit now, and we'll find out whether it was worth getting excited soon enough.\n\n\nAccording to an exclusive report from Insider Gaming, not only is there a chance that id Software could unveil a new Doom entry at this year's Xbox Games Showcase, the game's final title is said to be finalized. At one point, it was going to be called \"Year Zero,\" but it seems as though it's going with \"The Dark Ages.\" It's also said to have been in development for the past four years, so pretty much as soon as Eternal was complete.\n\n\n\n\nThe Xbox Games Showcase will be taking place on June 9, and will be a chance for Microsoft to discuss some exclusive games in its upcoming roster, though it's difficult to know exactly what's going to be on the schedule. The show will be immediately followed by a deep dive into Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.\n\n\nA look at the Slayer's past?\n\n\nWhile details about the new Doom are pretty scarce, the report and video above say there's a chance we could be going back in time, perhaps to Medieval times. The title The Dark Ages  does suggest it could take place in that time period, giving us a glimpse into the Doom Slayer's life back in days of yore.\n\n\nOf course, all expectations must be tempered at this point. As solid as these rumors sound, we're best off waiting until June 9 to see what's going to be confirmed. We're also hoping we'll get to see more Avowed during the showcase.\n\n\nPlaying my first Doom game as a young whippersnapper, I never thought the series would endure as much as it has. Although the team has changed over the decades, id Software's legendary FPS is not just trying to keep its head above the water; it's thriving in an increasingly competitive market. Here's to more demon slaying with whatever's on the horizon.\n\nThe post A new Doom will reportedly be announced at Xbox Games Showcase appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Call of Duty coming to Xbox Game Pass has been a topic of discussion since Microsoft's acquisition of Activision was announced. Now, Xbox has confirmed that Black Ops 6 will be on Game Pass from release day. \n\n\nTeasers for the next installment of the Call of Duty franchise dropped throughout last week, eventually leading to the official Black Ops 6 reveal on May 23. Now, on May 28, the official live-action reveal trailer has arrived, along with news confirming Black Ops 6 on Game Pass. \n\n\nIn a post on the Xbox website, Microsoft confirmed that they were \"excited to confirm that Game Pass members will be able to jump into Black Ops 6 on day one,\" a huge move for the series. \n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft didn't go into any more details about the decision, pointing players towards the Black Ops 6 Direct set for June 9 that will follow the Xbox Games Showcase. There, Activision and Treyarch will \"share even more details on what's coming in this all-new Call of Duty,\" including a first look at gameplay. \n\n\nWhile Microsoft president Sarah Bond had previously stated that all titles from their developers would appear on Game Pass, there was still some uncertainty around Call of Duty. While it was expected that older titles would be added to the platform, the decision to release this year's game on the service on launch day is huge, especially considering that CoD games regularly dominate the year's best-seller charts. \n\n\nHow this will affect sales of the FPS title remains to be seen, but it marks a seismic shift for the franchise and could help to boost player count when people don't have to drop $70 to try the game out. With the success of CoD's free-to-play battle royale Warzone already bringing players back to the franchise, it feels like a golden age of CoD could be upon us again. \n\nThe post Microsoft confirms Black Ops 6 on Xbox Game Pass at launch appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It's been a long time since we had a true competitor to EA Sports in the soccer simulator world, but according to new rumors, 2K Sports is working on a new FIFA game that will supposedly be released this year. \n\n\nIn a post by MohPlay Inc. on X, formerly Twitter, they claimed that 2K Sports had reached a partnership with football's governing body FIFA to develop a new series to rival EA Sports FC. The tweet claims that FIFA 2K25 is set to launch this year, just in time for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. This development timeline seems very quick, unless 2K were already working on a soccer game and landed the licensing after development had already begun.\n\n\nThis story was then corroborated by Insider Gaming's Mike Straw, who suggested there was \"more smoke to this,\" and that nobody was willing to talk to him about it on the record, before suggesting that an announcement was coming \"sooner rather than later.\"\n\n\n\n\nThis matches up with rumors from earlier in the year that suggested 2K and FIFA were in discussions, following the split between EA Sports and FIFA in 2023. The pair, who had worked together since the release of FIFA International Soccer in 1993, could not come to terms on a licensing agreement for the FIFA name, with EA Sports eventually deciding to move on without the branding and releasing EA Sports FC 24 in 2023. \n\n\nThis would mark the first major competitor to EA Sports in a while, as while Konami's Pro Evolution Soccer was a true rival to FIFA in the mid-2000s, its eFootball successor has failed to make a dent in the footballing juggernaut. \n\n\nAs we've seen in the past, competition is good for everyone, as it forces developers to up their games to keep ahead of their competition. Of course, take this all with a pinch of salt until we get confirmation from FIFA or 2K Sports, but as a fan of the game, I'd love to see someone take it to EA Sports. \n\nThe post Leak claims 2K Sports working on new FIFA game, releasing this year appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Wuthering Waves has officially been released for PC and mobile devices, which means millions of players have already downloaded the game and taken on the role of Rover.\n\n\nWhile there may have been some wrinkles in the launch, it looks like Kuro Games are getting everything ironed out, and people are enjoying their time with the combat-focused action RPG. What about the console players, however? When will Xbox and PlayStation fans be able to dive in?\n\n\nWhat is the Wuthering Waves Xbox and PlayStation release date?\n\n\nSadly, there is no official release date for Wuthering Waves on Xbox or PlayStation at this point in time. This is likely due to a much higher focus on mobile and PC gaming in developer Kuro's home market of China. I can only assume that a strong launch focused on those platforms and the home market would give the developer enough of an engaged userbase to very confidently move forward with console releases. \n\n\nThere is also the fact that it is easier to be agile with PC releases, allowing developers to work out any bugs and playerbase issues before releasing on consoles where certification of updates can be an issue. \n\n\nFor now, all console players can do is wait and hope for the best. While the developers have been very open in their desire to bring the title to consoles, that doesn't mean that it will be happening anytime soon. We also don't even know if the game is confirmed to be released on both consoles yet. These types of games seem to have some aversion to the Xbox at times, so it will be interesting to see if it is released on that platform at all.\n\nThe post What is the Wuthering Waves Xbox and PlayStation release date? appeared first on Destructoid.",

The \"urban action\" game will be free to play, and shall be available on PlayStation 5, PC, and mobile on the same day.\n\n\nTo accompany the happy news, we also got a new trailer for badass wolfman Lycaon. The one-eyed lupine is featured kicking a bunch of ass while accompanied by some very sweet guitar work.\n\n\n\n\nZenless Zone Zero is set in a post-apocalyptic world where all manner of weird supernatural events have occurred. These events, known as Hollows, have destroyed much of modern society, turning some areas into unlivable zones. The last city, New Eridu, is a place of relative calm and peace, but only because Proxies, like the player character, work so hard to keep it that way.\n\n\nThe combat is my personal favorite from Hoyoverse so far, leaning hard into quick swaps between characters that play off each other through aggressive skill rotations. During technical tests I had a lot of fun with the slightly goofy worldbuilding and puzzle-based exploration as well. The game also has a fun and colorful aesthetic that pulls heavily from the modern world but with a pleasant blend of inspirations from past fashion and future tech. All in all, I'm excited about this one and am eager to dive in on July 4.\n\n\nIf you like, you can pre-register at the official Zenless Zone Zero website to inch the community one step closer to a bunch of free loot. 36 million players have pre-registered to date, so there will be plenty of people to play with. There is also the free Stock Up web-based event for folks to take part in, should they wish.\n\nThe post Zenless Zone Zero is launching on July 4, so are you ready, Proxy? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The RPG genre is host to some of the longest games available. However, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is more of an RPG-lite, stripping out a lot of complexities and replacing them with simple action-based mechanics to keep it interesting. So, how long does it take to beat?\n\n\nThis all depends on how much side content you’re going to do and how much you’ll devote to exploration, but on average, it’s about 40 hours in length.\n\n\nIn my own personal experience, that's about the runtime. I didn't do absolutely every last activity, but I did take on a great deal of side content, and that's what I wound up with.\n\n\nWhile Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is structurally linear, there’s a decent amount of exploration piled in there. On top of that, you might try finding all the tattle log entries, Star Pieces, or Shine Sprites. Or maybe you’ll battle down the Pit of 100 Trials to gain every last badge you can from the game. There’s a lot that can keep you occupied, even before you reach the credits.\n\n\nOn top of that, the Switch version of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door piles on some additional content to the GameCube version to keep you satisfied for longer.\n\n\nIf you only concentrate on the critical path (only the necessary parts), it could take you more like 32 hours. However, that sounds like a pretty boring way to play. It’s more likely that, even without trying to complete absolutely everything, you’ll hit closer to 40 hours.\n\nThe post How long is Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Diablo 4's newest season introduced a whole heap of exciting changes, but there's one seemingly small adjustment that keeps causing some confusion online: the armor cap. In seasons past, the armor system would continuously scale with enemies of increasing level, even beyond 100, within Nightmare Dungeons. But now, a much lower hard cap has been introduced, so we're going to take a look at the number to hit and how to do it. \n\n\nWhat is the armor cap in Diablo 4?\n\n\nThe new armor cap is 9,230 Armor - once you reach this value, any more armor is a wasted stat. This value will provide 85% physical damage resistance against monsters of level 100 and beyond. Reaching this value isn't too difficult, at least not compared to juggling the various resistances in the game. \n\n\nIf you're in the process …",

          "description": "One of the biggest reasons Xbox acquired Activision Blizzard was for the Call of Duty series, a first-person shooter that has dominated the best-selling games list for decades. This would make it the perfect candidate to launch on Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft's gaming subscription service, in order to bring new subscribers in. Black Ops 6 was officially revealed last week, and while it was reported to be in consideration for a Game Pass launch, today, the news was confirmed from Xbox itself. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will launch on Game Pass day one.\nWe don't know much about the game yet, but two live-action teasers have been released so far. The first features a group of people covering the faces of Mount Rushmore with blindfolds that say, \"The truth lies.\" The second, released today, can be seen below.\n\n\nIt features world leaders' black and white camera footage speaking in hushed tones about a grand conspiracy about manufactured wars and the elusive nature of the truth. The trailer ends with the game's full title, along with a reminder that the full reveal will come on June 9, after Xbox's summer showcase.\nFor more Call of Duty, check out our reviews for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III and Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War.",

Smaller details include the cooking pot, a Skulltula, treasure chests, and a Korok tucked away on the treetop.\n\nThe Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 costs $299.99 and can be pre-ordered now on Lego's website.

The last Silent Hill Transmission happened in 2022 and revealed a surprising amount of Silent Hill news including the reveal of the remake of Silent Hill 2, Silent Hill f, a new Silent Hill movie, and more.\nThe post announcing the event reads, \"Consider this your invitation letter to Silent Hill. ✉️ Tune in May 30 at 4 p.m. PDT to our SILENT HILL YouTube channel for the second installment of the #SILENTHILL Transmission where we'll share game updates, a deeper look at the film, and new merch.\"\nThe safe bet is a teaser trailer for the movie and hopefully new details about the Silent Hill 2 remake and Silent Hill f, the latter of which seems like the franchise's next big original entry. Silent Hill Ascension, the online mobile narrative game where players dictated the story choices, also finished up its first season (though the developer may have a different term for it), so it's possible we may learn what's next for that game.",

It had a simple premise: Your character flees through a crumbling urban landscape, making great leaps across rooftops at the touch of your phone screen. It met great success and charted in what was then only a burgeoning mobile game ecosystem. Canabalt popularized the infinite runner genre and would ultimately put its designer, Adam Saltsman, on the map.\nNow working under the name of Finji as its creative director, Adam’s rise as a designer as well as his partner’s, Bekah Saltsman, as both a publisher and CEO, has been stunning to watch, especially considering the simplicity of that first big hit.

The Deluxe Edition includes the game, an exclusive steelbook, four pin badges, four keychains, and an artbook. Meanwhile, the Collector's Edition includes the game, Season Pass, pizza van statue, LED sign, five pin badges, four patches, a mouse mat, notebook, pen, artbook, poster, stickers, and a collector's box.

          "description": "Acquisitions have been rampant in the games industry recently. While the prime example on everyone's mind is likely Xbox's recent acquisition of Activision Blizzard, several have already occurred in 2024. The latest was announced today by Atari, which confirmed it is acquiring its longtime rival, Intellivision.\nAtari announced it has purchased the Intellivision brand and more than 200 games from Intellvision Entertainment. As part of the deal, Intellivision Entertainment will rebrand and continue developing and distributing the Amico game console with a license from Atari to distribute new versions of Intellivision games on the console. Atari will also look to expand digital and physical distribution of legacy Intellivision games, potentially create new games, and explore licensing opportunities. \n\"This was a very rare opportunity to unite former competitors and bring together fans of Atari, Intellivision, and the golden age of gaming,\" chairman and CEO of Atari Wade Rosen said in a press release. \n\"Atari has been a valuable partner and we have every confidence they will be a responsible steward of the storied Intellvision brand,\" CEO of Intellivision Entertainment Phil Adam said. \"We look forward to our expanded collaboration and bringing a broad array of new Atari and Intellivision titles to the Amico and Amico Home family gaming platforms.\"\nAtari has been experiencing a bit of a re-emergence in the public consciousness lately. In addition to other acquisitions, such as Nightdive Studios and Digital Eclipse, Atari has also published well-received games like Mr. Run and Jump and Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration. For more on Atari's outlook and current strategy, be sure to listen to a 2023 episode of All Things Nintendo, which featured an in-depth conversation with Wade Rosen right here.",

Druckmann is expectedly vague about Naughty Dog's next big project but offers an enticing tease, saying, \"I'm eager to see how this new game resonates, especially following the success of The Last of Us, as it could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming.\"\nThe interview, however, primarily focuses on technology and how it improves and makes it easier for creators to tell unique stories. Regarding AI, Druckmann says, \"AI is really going to revolutionize how content is being created, although it does bring up some ethical issues we need to address. With technologies like AI and the ability to do motion capture right from home, we're reducing both costs and technical hurdles, opening the door for us to take on more adventurous projects and push the boundaries of storytelling in games.\"\nHe also briefly touches on the future of The Last of Us TV show, citing that modern technology has allowed him to oversee the TV show's second season remotely from Los Angeles while it shoots in Canada.\nYou can read the full interview here.

Immediately following the presentation, there will be a second livestream to highlight an upcoming game in a \"beloved\" series. Today, the subject of that showcase has been revealed, and surprising no one, it's a new Call of Duty game.\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 6 is a title that might confuse some, seeing as there technically isn't a game titled Black Ops 5. This is because the fifth entry of the sub-series, which launched in 2021, was Black Ops Cold War, temporarily removing the numbered naming convention. The news was announced on social media, but was accompanied by a teaser on YouTube that seems to hint at the events of the game's campaign.\n\n\nThe 40-second clip follows a group of people sneaking onto the top of Mount Rushmore, where they place blindfolds over the eyes of the presidents carved into the mountainside. The first three blindfolds read, \"The truth lies,\" while the fourth features a three-headed wolf logo that was used in the initial redacted teaser of the game.\nThe game will be revealed in full during a presentation on Saturday, June 9, immediately following the Xbox showcase that will start at 10 AM PT/ 1 PM ET. Microsoft is reportedly debating on whether or not the launch the game on Game Pass.\nWhat are you hoping to see from the newest Call of Duty? Let us know in the comments!",

Today, Netflix released the first teaser trailer for Season 4 giving fans their first look at Hemsworth in the role.\n\n\nUnfortunately, Hemsworth doesn’t speak in the brief clip, so we still don’t know how his Geralt voice compares to Cavill’s (or the games, for that matter). But he definitely doesn’t look out of place as the White Wolf and, hopefully, won’t be too much of a distraction in this new season.\nSeason 4 is currently in production in the UK and will be filmed back-to-back with Season 5, which will also be the show's finale. It has no release date but is speculated to premiere in 2025. These last two seasons will cover the three remaining Witcher books: Baptism of Fire, The Tower of the Swallow, and Lady of the Lake. The returning cast includes Anya Chalotra (Yennifer) and Freya Allan (Ciri). \nFor more on The Witcher games, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt got its official PC mod tools this week.

          "description": "Crytek has announced the release date for Hunt: Showdown’s new-gen update, which will also conclude support for the current console versions. This update was first announced last September and will essentially force last-gen players to migrate to current consoles to continue playing the popular shooter. \nIn a developer update, general manager David Fifield announced that the CryEngine 5.11 Update will go live on August 15. This update is treated as a “significant relaunch” that brings native PS5/Xbox Series X/S support along with a host of technical improvements. However, it also means the PS4 and Xbox One versions will become unplayable.\nThat means these players must upgrade to current hardware to continue playing their copies of the game. Crytek assures these players that if they decide to upgrade, player accounts, entitlements, and all owned DLC will transfer to the new-gen version for no extra cost. \n\n\nIn addition to technical improvements, the 5.11 Update also introduces a new map and biome. In the months leading to 5.11’s launch, Crytek plans to address community and survey feedback. That includes improved reporting systems to address cheating and toxic player behavior, design reworks tackling hunter revival, health chunks, restorations, burning down hunters, and reducing stalemates. The game is also getting a new user interface, and Crytek will continue evolving the game's recruitment and prestige progression requirements. \nHunt: Showdown first launched for Xbox and PC in 2019, with the PS4 version arriving in 2020. The PvPvE first-person shooter is set in 1865 Louisiana as players, either alone or with two or three friends, hunt supernatural bounties in the bayou while fending off other player-controlled bounty hunters. \nFor more on Crytek, you can read about the studio's next big project, Crysis 4.",

It simultaneously premiered in theaters and on Peacock on October 27, 2023, and still managed to be a massive box office success.

This time, there will be no second chances.\" The sequel’s cast has not been announced, but the original starred Josh Hutchinson and included Matthew Lillard, Elizabeth Lail, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Piper Rubio. Director Emma Tammi is returning to direct the sequel, with FNAF creator Scott Cawthorn and Blumhouse founder Jason Blum once again assuming producer roles. \nFNAF 2 won't be the only video game film arriving in 2025.

But it seems like the fallout from this recent boom in popularity hasn't died down quite yet. Thanks to a teaser shared on Fortnite's official social media pages, we know that Fallout will be coming to Fortnite pretty soon\npic.twitter.com/AKjFXVnHST\nMay 17, 2024\nThe teaser image shows power armor in a cloud of orange dust, accompanied by what appears to be some sort of industrial building. Other than that, there's not much to go on, but we can make educated guesses. For one, Fortnite's current season will end on May 24, so this is the perfect time to tease the skins that might be coming in the next battle pass. And if it's anything like the recent Avatar: The Last Airbender and Star Wars crossovers, we might see Fallout-themed mechanics or areas appear on the battle royale map itself.\nIt will almost certainly involve some sort of cosmetic pack as well, which could include characters from the games, the Amazon Prime show, or both. Thanks to the teaser, we know power armor will be making an appearance, but it's unclear whether it will be an item to equip in-game or a skin that can be unlocked or purchased.\nFor more Fortnite news, read about its recent crossover with Billie Eilish, its decision to allow players to block certain emotes, and its huge and mysterious collaboration with Disney.\nWhat are you hoping to see included in this crossover?

This follows reports in previous weeks indicating Microsoft and Xbox were mulling over whether or not to launch the next iteration in the franchise on Game Pass, out of fear it might hurt sales. \nAfter acquiring Activision Blizzard for a colossal $69 billion last year, fans and analysts have speculated about how Microsoft will handle the Call of Duty franchise moving forward. It will obviously be a big draw for Xbox Game Pass, pulling in new subscribers, but most every year, the new Call of Duty is the best-selling game of the year – save for last year, where Hogwarts Legacy took that crown – and a Game Pass launch could affect those sales numbers. \n\n\nHowever, this new report from The Wall Street Journal seemingly clears the air around that topic. \n\"Microsoft plans a major shake up of its video game sales strategy by releasing the coming installment of Call of Duty to its subscription service instead of the longtime, lucrative approach of only selling it a la carte,\" the story reads. \nOf course, things could change so we'll see what happens. It's likely we'll be learning what the next Call of Duty game is next month as part of the gaming showcase summer that includes Summer Game Fest, Ubisoft Forward, and an Xbox Games Showcase followed by a secret direct that is probably focused on Call of Duty.\n[Source: The Wall Street Journal]\nWhat setting do you hope the next Call of Duty takes place in?

Fans online are already speculating what it could be, considering some of 2K's biggest franchises are prime for a new game. \nAs for when to expect this new game, the official SGF X (formerly Twitter) account says it will be announced on June 7, during the Summer Game Fest livestream that begins at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET. That's less than a month away so we don't have to speculate too long on what this mystery iteration could be. \n2K plans to reveal the next iteration in one of 2K's biggest and most beloved franchises at @SummerGameFest on Friday, June 7. pic.twitter.com/1vyFXE2N4z\nMay 16, 2024\nWhile there are plenty of 2K franchises that fit the bill, our eyes are on three franchises: Borderlands, Mafia, and BioShock. \nThe last mainline Borderlands entry – Borderlands 3 – hit PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in 2019, and with the live-action Borderlands movie hitting theaters this August, a new game would make sense. However, we did just get New Tales From The Borderlands in 2022, if you're looking for something to play through in that universe. \nOn the Mafia front, the last mainline entry was Mafia III in 2016, although 2K released Mafia: Definitive Edition – a remake – in 2020. And we know the next Mafia game is in development, too, so it might be time for an announcement. \nBioShock has been dormant since BioShock Infinite in 2013, unless you count the 2016 remasters, and we know 2K created Cloud Chamber in 2019 to work on the next entry in the franchise. It's been almost five years since then, so SGF seems like a great moment to announce the next BioShock. Speaking of, here's what we want in a BioShock 4. \nSGF returns to Los Angeles next month, with the live showcase happening on June 7. For more, check out some of the studios, publishers, and partners to be featured during the event, and then check out Game Informer's summer gaming showcase schedule. \nWhat do you think this new iteration will be?

          "description": "Grand Theft Auto VI's reveal last December sent fans into a tizzy, but its then-distant 2025 release window immediately tempered that excitement. While the launch seemed more in reach now that we’re nearly midway through 2024, it appears we’ll have to wait another full year before playing it.\nPublisher Take-Two released its 2024 year-end financial report today (thanks, PC Gamer), in which it states that Rockstar is targeting a Fall 2025 release window for GTA VI. This timing is reiterated in a calendar of the publisher’s upcoming releases, posted below.\nRegarding GTA VI, Take-Two states, “We are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase.” The game is slated to release for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. A PC version has yet to be mentioned. \nGrand Theft Auto VI takes players to a modern-day Vice City (the franchise's parody of Miami, FL) and stars two protagonists, a female inmate named Lucia and her still-unnamed criminal male partner. To say anticipation is high would be an understatement; the premiere trailer garnered over 100 million views in only 24 hours, breaking a YouTube record. \nAs we continue the long wait for Grand Theft Auto VI’s launch, check out our video of Game Informer’s two resident Florida Men reacting to the debut trailer. You can also read about Take-Two's recent closure of developers Roll7 (Rollerdrome, OlliOlli World) and Intercept Games (Kerbal Space Program 2).",

          "description": "Ghost of Tsushima, specifically the Director's Cut, is out on PC today. It's a fantastic game that should be welcomed with open arms as it makes its way to a new platform, but we were specifically curious about how it performs on Steam Deck. The game is not Steam Deck verified primarily because certain features are not supported on Valve's handheld, or other comparable mobile PC game platforms. However, the offline content (the single-player campaign and the expansion) has been specifically adjusted to play well on Steam Deck. You can read port studio Nixxes Software explanation here. And spending a little time with the game shows that the single-player campaign does, in fact, play well on Steam Deck. It's not without its shortcomings – a high-end PC or a PlayStation 5 are still the best ways to play the game – but Steam Deck appears to be a great way to play the game if that's your only option or you want a portable version.\nYou can check out some gameplay with commentary from myself and Wesley LeBlanc below.\n\n\nHead to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

While the company has yet to publicly address the closures directly, Xbox president Sarah Bond said in an interview that the closures were about keeping the business healthy in the long-term. It's why news of this new studio might be surprising, given one week ago, the parent company of Activision was closing studios to cut costs. \n\n\n\"Built from the ground up, Elsewhere Entertainment is a premier and standalone studio dedicated to establishing an environment that inspires bold and diverse ideas,\" a blog post reads. \"The team's underlying mission encourages everyone to explore and collaborate creatively to craft a franchise with an enduring legacy that resonates far beyond games. [The] new studio has full access to Activision's resources and tools as it continues to increase production and development. \n\"Elsewhere is opening its search for best-in-class talent from across the industry and around the world to help create a state-of-the-art and next generation gaming experience.\" \nElsewhere is currently made up of developers with experience working on franchises like The Last of Us, Uncharted, The Witcher, Cyberpunk 2077, Destiny, Tom Clancy's The Division, and Far Cry. \nWhat kind of game do you hope Elsewhere makes?

The game has only been available in PC Early Access since April 26, meaning it achieved this milestone in only three weeks.\nPublisher Hooded Horse announced the sales account for Steam, Epic, GOG, and the Microsoft Store (where Manor Lords is also playable through PC Game Pass). The game quickly caught fire, selling 1 million copies a day after launch. Since then, Manor Lords has enjoyed a consistently high concurrent player count, peaking at 173,000 on Steam in its first weekend.  \n\n\nManor Lords is being developed by Slavic Games and puts players in the shoes of a medieval lord tasked with building and growing a city. Players manage their city’s community, infrastructure, economy, and defense/expansion, the latter of which unfold as large-scale tactical battles. The intricate social and production systems combined with an ever-changing world (complete with seasonal and weather changes) result in an organic metropolis that players have taken to in a big way. \nManor Lords joins Early Access hits this year, such as Palworld and Hades II. The game’s 1.0 launch is currently up in the air as the game continues to change and improve based on player feedback. It’s off to a great start, though, and we’re curious to see how it evolves throughout its EA period.",
