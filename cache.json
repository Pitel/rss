Not out of a lack of enjoyment or interest, but because they were so satisfying that they left nothing else to want. Or because it would be too hard to recapture the joy of a first playthrough. Or maybe because they just ended really damn well. Whatever the reasoning, join us as we ponder our favourite games that we’ve never returned to.\r\n\n\r\nPlus!

          "description": "Based on the shooter series of the same name, the Borderlands film now has an official release date: August 9th, 2024. The action-comedy adaptation wrapped principal shooting in 2021, but it’s been somewhat stuck in post-production limbo ever since with several rounds of reshoots pushing out the release further than expected. \r\n\n\r\nThis comes after reports that co-writer Craig Mazin - best known as the showrunner behind HBO’s The Last Of Us and Chornobyl - removed his name from the project in favour of a pseudonym. More recently, Mazin confirmed to Variety that the pen name reports were false and he’s instead “not a credited writer” on Borderlands at all anymore. Mazin is instead focusing on The Last Of Us’ second season.\r\n\n\r\nThe Borderlands was mostly directed by Eli Roth, known for his work on the Hostel films and Cabin Fever. Roth was reportedly busy during reshoots, however, so studio Lionsgate enlisted the help of Tim Miller, the director behind Deadpool, to helm the project for a few weeks. \r\n \nRead more",

You'll rewind and fast forward time to plot suspicious movements, track stolen objects as they move across town, and work out who (or what) is causing all this chaos.

Starting today, The Elder Scrolls Online and Murder By Numbers are both free to keep from the digital store. Something for multiplayer dragon slayers and solo picross lovers alike. \r\n\n \r\nThe Elder Scrolls Online is, well, The Elder Scrolls but online. The long-running MMO has been unlocking doors into every corner of Tamriel, most recently with the Necrom expansion’s otherworldly tentacles and massive mushrooms. It's good at accommodating solo players who are looking to scratch a Skyrim-sized itch - since the next Elder Scrolls is at least five years away. That approachability got the game into our list of the ten best MMOs on PC. \r\n\n\r\nOn the other end of the humanities versus maths spectrum, we have Murder By Numbers, a murder mystery visual novel where you complete picross puzzles to further the investigation. Plus there's a robo-friend who pulls out a monocle every now and then, which is just plain cute. AliceB said the game was “worth a poke around if you’re a fan of either genre involved,” in our Murder By Numbers review. Even though neither half “are given enough space to breathe,” it should be worth a try for the affordable price of zero pence, though. \r\n \nRead more",

I held out hope it would improve, though, as lots of commenters assured me it's fun side would finally surface. \"Just play several more hours and things really open up! Variety in the dinos, in the modes, in just about everything!\". To some extent, they were right. There are fun moments to be had as you queue up for Dino Survival and suddenly, remarkably, things have changed a bit.\nBut the game doesn't respect your time. It forces you to sit through hours of repetitive dino-slaying and then only offers you the chance, the chance to slay dinos in a way that isn't excruciatingly samey. Even as someone who finds the fun in mindless carnage, I'd much rather ditch my mech suit and let the dinosaurs run rampant. The dinosaurs don't deserve this.\nRead more",

Its unusual triple-decker sandwich of strategic, match-three RPG puzzling hasn't really been replicated in the fifteen-odd years since it first came out, unless you count its own HD remaster that came out in 2011. Alas, with that version now having gone off sale on PC in favour of this further spruced up Definitive Edition, this is now the best and only way to play it. Originally developed by the same core team at Capybara Games that went on to make the excellent Grindstone, this Definitive Edition has been handled entirely by remake house Dotemu, and yep, I now see what all the fuss is about. However, I also have quite a lot of reservations about it. For all its clear, obvious brilliance, it's also a very hard game to love. Because it really is very hard, and I still can't quite decide if I'm having fun or not.\nRead more",

It's big, it's very big.\" As the team developed that script through countless drafts, they did frequent writer's rooms across three years for As Dusk Falls, but with frequent plot changes, backyard trailer shoots and the sheer grind of making it to the finish line, Marchal and studio director Charu Desodt reflect on just how ambitious it was for the studio's debut game.\nRead more",

Its Definitive Edition is out now, though, so maybe its \"cult\" status will finally blossom into mainstream appeal.

Turns out there’s plenty more, as port developers Nixxes Software have used a  Sony blog post to detail quite a few new tech toys – including Rift Apart’s Microsoft DirectStorage 1.2 support.\nDirectStorage is simultaneously one of the most exciting recent developments in gaming hardware, and one of the most underutilised: it basically adapts your PC’s process for reading data from an SSD or hard drive in a way that can massively reduce game loading times, but has so far only made it to prime time in Forspoken. I suppose the upside is that once Rift Apart is out on July 26th, DirectStorage’s compatible games list will increase by 100%?\nRead more",

          "description": "I never thought I'd hear the words 'roguelite' and 'Minesweeper' together in the same sentence but here we are. Let's! Revolution! is a joyous mix of both Minesweeper and a roguelite, tasking players with hunting down a deliciously repugnant king through a series of increasingly complex tile maps to enact their titular coup. With all tiles facing down on arrival, you'll need to hop from square to square to flip them over and reveal the king's hiding place before progressing to the next level. But with several of his royal agents stalking the roads and highways, you'll need to choose your route carefully, making good use of your character's unique set of skills to arrive at your final destination of Beebom City. That, and employing a bit of the old Minesweeper noggin, of course. \nYou see, tiles come in two types in Let's! Revolution! The aforementioned road tiles, and surrounding landscape tiles. The latter all have numbers denoting how many road tiles surround it, giving you just enough information to build up a picture of where the road (and the king's lackeys) might be lurking. Take care, though. This lot are a tricksy bunch, and can quite quickly overwhelm if they're revealed too soon and all at once. That's Let's! Revolution! in a nutshell, at least, but the real joy of this run-based rogue comes from its gorgeous presentation and its brilliantly conceived character classes that twist and mould its basic building blocks into fresh new forms each and every time. It's great fun, and I can't get enough of it.\nRead more",

From her childhood bedroom right up until her first house, I love how relaxing and gratifying it is to decorate each room. But after replaying it for this month's RPS Game Club, there’s one section that gave me quite the opposite reaction.\nA big part of Unpacking is learning about the character’s personalities through their objects: what clothes they have in their wardrobes, what items fill their bookshelves, which kitchen utensils make it from move to move, and so on. These contextual clues act as a subtle but incredibly effective story-telling device. There is one level, however, where it’s not all laid-back fun times and it's when the protagonist moves in with her first partner, who I will henceforth be referring to as ‘finance bro boyfriend’ - and wow, he is the absolute worst.

          "description": "When I think back on most of the cinematic platformers I've played recently, it's not the latter part of their genre title I remember most, but the former. The lush camera pans of your Planet Of Lanas, the haunting backdrops of your Somervilles and the gooey, malleable monstrosities of your Insides. These dramatic moments linger in the memory much longer than their respective running and jumping, and if it's a proper platforming challenge I'm after, I usually look elsewhere, swapping cinema for action with your Raymans, Trines and Oris. \nFull Void, on the other hand, is a cinematic run and jumper that manages to strike a good balance between both parts of its personality. Following in the Another World school of gorgeous pixel art meets one-foot-wrong-and-you're-dead-style platforming (albeit with much more generous checkpointing than its 1991 source material), there's a real athleticism in your teen hero's journey to bring down a despotic AI, making its intricate leaps and bounds just as memorable as its down-to-the-wire set pieces.\nRead more",

          "description": "The Ryzen 5 7600X processor might be one of AMD's cheapest options in their Zen 4 lineup, but this chip is still hugely powerful compared to prior Ryzen generations. It takes advantage of its 5nm process and the AM5 socket to hit higher clock speeds, has architectural improvements that raise its single-core prowess, and of course has access to DDR5 memory and PCIe 5.0 add-in cards too. That's made it a strong option for gaming, but a high asking price of $300 at launch - plus expensive motherboards and DDR5 - put it out of reach of most sane budget builds. That's slowly changing as these chips and other components become cheaper, and today the 7600X has hit a new low price in the US: just $200 at Amazon.com, a full $100 off its MSRP and a great deal for a processor with this kind of performance. \nRead more",

Which may be why I don't quite know how I feel about Decarnation.\nThere's a big content warning needed here for sexual assault, something that I assumed would turn out to be the whole point of the game. An unfair judgement, it turns out, as one of its strengths is the intriguing mystery of what's actually going on, not the more common \"what traumatic thing is everything a metaphor for\".\nProtagonist Gloria has a lot going on, see. She's a talented cabaret dancer who recently modelled for a statue, for an artist who immediately makes some creepy remarks about how she's an ugly old hag at 29. Misogyny and self image are at the heart of this, but they're wrapped up in Gloria's worries about getting older, chasing intimacy with a new lover, and her deep love for dance, an art form that games so rarely do much with. It's not an ugly or blunt game, despite its distressing themes, and I think that's why it works for me overall.\nRead more",

It sunk an entire studio.  Disney's Treasure Planet and Sinbad: Legend Of The Seven Seas? Many credit them for having killed traditional 2D animation altogether. Hardly the crime any movie pirate would like to be remembered for.\nLuckily, pirates have thrived in the world of gaming — in more ways than one — you could say. Over the course of its entire history, gaming has featured a wide variety of pirate-themed games. There's no lack of offers, variety, and quality, so let's find out which one is the best of them all.\n[caption id=\"attachment_272221\" align=\"ali…",

Certain songs have become the theme of generations, and the constant evolution of music, and music creation is still one of the most prevalent forms of expression today. Take someone like Moshibass for example, and his Kirby Otamatone.\n[caption id=\"attachment_392731\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot by Moshibass[/caption]\nKirby Otamatone leads Troupe in Bring Me to Life Cover\nFor those who are unfamiliar, the Otamatone is a portable music synthesizer created in the shape of an eighth note. To play the instrument, you squeeze its head. This is followed by sliding your fingers up and down the \"stem\" to change the pitch. You can also add vibrato to the sounds played by shaking the Otamatone. Its popularity has skyrocketed online, especially thanks to Moshibass' cover of Bring Me to Life by Evanescence.\nThe cover contains a full backing track, with main vocals provided by a Kirby-themed Otamatone Deluxe. Backup vocals are performed by Hello Kitty and Gudetama-themed Otamatones. Moshibass brings their previous knowledge as a musician and music teacher to cleverly translate the lyrics of the classic 2000s song into a silly ballad with cutesy musical notes.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmxLja-DRIw\nIf you've heard the song, you'll be able to hear the lyrics coming from Kirby and the rest of the Otamatones. You can see the video, and Moshibass' other Otamatone covers on their youtube channel. The channel also includes a tutorial on how to play your own Otamatone, as well as tutorials for popular video game songs on guitar, and ukelele.\nThe post This Kirby Otamatone brings angst back with this Bring Me to Life Cover appeared first on Destructoid.",

Names like Li Mei. I don't remember her from any of the games, so I shot over to the awful Mortal Kombat Fandom wiki to get a refresher on this fighter I'd completely forgotten.\nEven after reading her bio, I still don't remember her. But I guess we'll be reacquainted later this year as a new trailer from NetherRealm today confirmed she's coming to Mortal Kombat 1 alongside Tanya, who I do remember from Mortal Kombat X. Both fighters feature heavily in the spot, as does Baraka, who is back as a playable character.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sLJ-xyjMQo\nWith the game still several weeks from launch, NetherRealm decided now is as good a time as any to confirm all the DLC rumors that have been swirling since it was revealed. In a second trailer released on Friday, the developer confirmed the kombatants of what will likely be the first Kombat Pack. Included are:\nOmni-Man (Invincible)\nHomelander (The Boys)\nPeacemaker (Peacemaker, Suicide Squad)\nQuan Chi (Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm)\nErmac (Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3)\nTakeda (Mortal Kombat X)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eT-3vhCl6N4\nMortal Kombat 1 releases on September 14 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Switch. Pricing and a release schedule for the Kombat Pack haven't been revealed yet, but you can secure the six fighters above if you purchase the Premium or Kollector's Edition.\nThe post Li Mei, Tanya, Omni-Man, and Homelander will draw blood in Mortal Kombat 1 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Seems like they did a pretty alright job, too.\nIs this what we expected from the folks working on Klonoa and Katamari to move onto? Maybe not quite, but it's certainly whimsical and interesting. And now, I can finally see if I can pull all those slider bars right, to keep the puppy safe. Or clear the parking lot, or safely travel across a long walkway using only a giant stack of wooden beams. There's even a little gacha-style machine in there, for collecting titles.

After a handful of beta events, Digital Extremes announced Wayfinder will be hitting Early Access on August 15. Founder's Packs will be available in several tiers with each offering access to Wayfinder as well as two seasons of unique rewards. Of course, each founder's pack has its own separate cosmetic rewards as well. The ARPG will launch on both PC (Steam) and PlayStation with full cross-play and cross-save support.\nDigital Extremes also unveiled an all-new playable sharpshooter class called the Venomess: here's the trailer showing off the new class and announcing the upcoming Early Access.\nhttps://youtu.be/0TdDWdfhAMU\nAn interactive Battle Pass that never expires\nEach founder's pack will also grant you access to the Season 1 and 2 Reward Towers. Digital Extremes claims this unique battle pass will allow you to choose your own path toward earning unique seasonal rewards. Unlocks from the Rewards Tower include exclusive characters, Sprays, Charms, pets, and other cosmetics. Interestingly, each season's Battle Pass in Wayfinder never expires allowing players to grind it out how they want and when they want.\nI had the chance to play in the Wayfinders beta and it definitely shows some promise. The fast-paced combat felt quite satisfying. Also, the varying playstyles of each class provide the potential for true class identity and agency. Overall it was way too mission-based for my liking, but that's exactly what Waframe fans are accustomed to. The ability to team up with friends and blast through high-intensity action in an online setting is great, even if it's not quite MMO-like. Even Warframe opened up into the more traditional MMO experience over time, so perhaps Wayfinder will do the same.\nWayfinder hits early access on PC (Steam) and PlayStation on August 15.\nThe post Online ARPG Wayfinder hits Early Access in August appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's likely some of the more glaring issues like the experience and vulnerability changes will be discussed.\nAlso, with Diablo 4 season 1 releasing just yesterday I imagine there will be some discussion in regard to plans for the first post-season update.\nI'll be sure to do a recap of the stream afterward as well.

The \"Necrom\" version is $60 and adds in \"all previous chapters,\" which at this point includes: High Isle, Blackwood, Greymoor, Elsweyr, Summerset, and Morrowind.\nYou can grab Elder Scrolls Online for free right here.

          "description": "Not creepy in the horror sense\nWristwork has revealed their upcoming game about hungrily harvesting data called Faceminer. This is the sort of thing that makes me feel more uncomfortable than actual horror does.\nFaceminer is set against the “techno-optimism” of the ‘90s. It puts you in front of a ‘90s-era operating system and has you go to work harvesting people’s biometric data. From there, you have to keep up with regulatory and technological demands as you navigate a corrupt bureaucratic system and continually upgrade your equipment. Buy and sell people’s personal data, just like a real tech company!\nhttps://youtu.be/ntnYoBBsq14\nAgainst the backdrop of white-knuckled multi-tasking, Faceminer sets itself up as a narrative game. You sift through emails and get to know other data scrapers in the business.\nEven just with the trailers and information given, Faceminer looks like an evocative reflection of the disgustingly internet-driven world we live in. Information is a commodity, but it’s most valuable in large quantities. Everyone wants it, and everyone is taking it without asking to use or re-sell. It’s the true price of “free” information. You can’t be anonymous and access this data at the same time. I’ve learned to accept this as part of the society we live in, but I still hate it.\nAnywho, we’ll see if Faceminer is a fun game or just an insightful one when it gets released, uh, hm… Soon. Eventually?\nThe post Faceminer is a creepy yet topical game about data harvesting appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "These bikes don't work over water unless you've got POWER!\nAkupara Games has announced that they’ll be publishing Videocult’s upcoming lo-fi hoverbike game, Airframe Ultra.\nUnless you count all the rust, Airframe Ultra is quite a departure from Videocult’s previous game, Rain World. In this one, you ride around on a hoverbike, winning races and eliminating the competition. While the trailer gives a good long look at the gameplay, both it and the press release I got with it suggest that there’s still much to do in establishing the mechanics of the game. For one thing, you never really see a starting grid or finish line. There’s also combat intermingled with what otherwise looks like racing.\nhttps://youtu.be/KNgKB6TbA_4\nIt looks like Videocult is focused on getting the feel of the hoverbike right and then working from there. You can really tell how much effort has gone into the animations and physics of the game, as the rider leans and the weight shifts on the bike. It’s also interesting how you can plant your weapon in the ground to enable quick turns.\nReally, while a lot is left to be seen in regards to gameplay, what has been shown is enough to get me interested in Airframe Ultra. I used to love Jet-Moto when I was younger, and the hoverbikes remind me of that. Meanwhile, the lo-fi early-3D aesthetic and CRT filter, along with the cyberpunk environments really speak to me. I guess I just love filth.\nAnother thing missing from the press materials is a release date. Right now, we only know that Airframe Ultra is coming to Steam.\nThe post Airframe Ultra is a gritty, lo-fi hoverbike game from Rain World devs appeared first on Destructoid.",

The consensus was not great; even board partners didn't appear too enthusiastic about Team Green's latest Ada Lovelace offering. Much of that comes down to the price. However, it now looks as though things may be worse than first appeared.\nAccording to a report from TechPowerUp, the 16GB variant of the Nvidia graphics card is worse than its 8GB predecessor.

It makes me happy.\nThis year's San Diego Comic-Con may be scaled down from years past with the ongoing WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, but that doesn't mean there won't be any news out of the show. With television shows and movies taking a backseat this year, that means the spotlight can finally return to the one thing that lives at the heart of SDCC. I am of course talking about Marvel's Spider-Man 2. The upcoming action-adventure game is just a couple of months away, and today at SDCC, we got a brand new story trailer that gives us a good look at perennial favorite Venom.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgqGdIoa52s\nThis wasn't the only big Spidey announcement today. Sony also revealed it's releasing a Marvel's Spider-Man 2-themed PlayStation 5 console bundle, complete with a custom controller and custom console covers. The bundle will also include a voucher for the digital version of the game even though this limited edition PS5 is fully capable of playing discs.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM9ICVdZLuQ\nA far younger version of me would be pretty stoked to put something like this up in my apartment.

The same goes for the Spider-Man 2 DualSense controller. Pre-orders begin July 28 on the PlayStation website and at select retailers. The console bundle, covers, and DualSense controller will release on September 1. If you do order the full bundle, know that it comes with a couple of in-game perks, including early access to two suits and an early unlock of the Web Grabber gadget.\nMarvel's Spider-Man 2 releases exclusively for PlayStation 5 on October 20, 2023.\nThe post New Spider-Man 2 SDCC trailer gives us our first full look at Venom appeared first on Destructoid.",

And, I have to admit, it looks very impressive! The battles looks fast-paced and reminds me a lot of the combat in Monster Hunter. I'd say maybe even with a mix of God of War thrown in.\nYou can target specific body parts on larger enemies like their legs and feet in an effort to incapacitate them and cause them to fall to the ground. Also similar to Monster Hunter, breaking certain body parts can result in unique resources unlocking special crafting options. Here's the combat trailer for Atlas Fallen.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQfhGubWns\nIn Atlas Fallen, you can have two main weapons equipped at the same time and switch between them to unleash a variety of combos. Throughout the video, we see several weapons with varying styles including a cleaver, whip, and even fist weapons. You evade attacks by rolling and dashing and can even jump high into the air to keep the pressure on bigger enemies.\nYou also build momentum with each successful attack. Momentum grants you the ability to use special attacks and also empowers your weapon. However, the more momentum you have, the more damage you will take the next time you are hit. I'm excited to see how this risk vs. reward system actually feels in combat.\nThe trailer also confirmed that Atlas Fallen will be fully playable via online two-player co-op. The entire campaign can be completed with a friend, which will definitely be fun with this style of combat. I always enjoyed teaming up with friends to take down a particularly pesky beast in Monster Hunter.\nAtlas Fallen releases on August 10 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.\nThe post New Atlas Fallen combat trailer gives me Monster Hunter vibes appeared first on Destructoid.",

While those two games were released in arcade and ported to consoles, Parasol Stars skipped the first step and went straight to consoles.

          "description": "Cram it in your fruit hole\nKrillbite Studio, the people behind Among the Sleep and Mosaic, have announced their next game. It’s Fruitbus, and it’s here to fill the massive, truck-sized hole in my heart.\nI really need this after the colossal disappointment that was Food Truck Simulator. I’m still not over that. Fruitbus is generally a similar concept, except all your food is vegan, and you serve it to animals. You get to explore an open world in the eponymous food service vehicle and gather ingredients to feed to all the folks.\nhttps://youtu.be/YOK-vXFoDOs\nThe trailer shows off a wide variety of activities, customization, and faces to stuff with food. Listen, this is going to sound really weird, but seeing that you have to pull the parking brake is really exciting to me. It’s the small touches that connect you to a game’s world, and you should never count out the mundane tactile tasks as an effective way to draw you in.\nThat’s about all the information we have here. I mean, really, they had me at parking brake. I don’t want to get my hopes up too much about Fruitbus. However, it looks like it ticks a lot of my extremely specific boxes. I was really excited for Food Truck Simulator, but it failed to deliver. Hopefully, what it really needed was some smoothies and the hungry faces of crowds of furries.\nUnfortunately, I’ll be waiting until 2024 to play Fruitbus. It’s coming to PC and “consoles.”\nThe post Fruitbus is a food truck sim that I need right now appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It's been making tracks\nKonami has announced that their 2020 game, Momotaro Dentetsu: Showa, Heisei, Reiwa mo Teiban, has passed 4 million units sold. What’s important about that? Well, a few things.\nMomotaro Dentetsu: Showa, Heisei, Reiwa mo Teiban has never been released outside of Japan. That’s not entirely surprising, as Momotaro Dentetsu is a long-running series that started back on the Famicom back in 1988. Back then, it was produced by Hudson Soft, but after Hudson went bust, all its assets were bought out by Konami in 2012. However, in all that time, Momotaro Dentetsu has never been localized. Not one game. It has always stayed in Japan.\n[caption id=\"attachment_392615\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Konami[/caption]\nFurthermore, 4 million sales in Japan is a crazy number. To put this into perspective, Famitsu reported last month that The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has a lifetime sales number of 2,208,705. It’s not quite the numbers of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (5,211,237) or Super Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (5,328,989) and not even close to touching Animal Crossing New Horizons (7,477,507). Still, for a non-first-party Switch exclusive, it’s a rather insane number.\nSo, does this mean we’ll see it over here? Failing that, will the West get the upcoming Momotaro Dentetsu World: Chikyuu wa Kibou de Mawatteru!? It’s not impossible, but I wouldn’t exactly count on it. The Momotaro Dentetsu games are steeped in Japanese culture. They’re in the style of board games, and are largely about traveling Japan’s legendary rail system to buy up as much of it as possible. It’s sort of like Monopoly but for public transportation.\nThe point is, I found this very fascinating, and if you’re reading this paragraph, chances are you’ve fallen victim to my eclectic enthusiasm. You’re welcome or I’m sorry. Take your pick.\nThe post 2020’s Momotaro Dentetsu: Showa, Heisei, Reiwa mo Teiban has sold over 4 million in Japan appeared first on Destructoid.",

Madden NFL 24 brings new improvements to the FieldSense system, Franchise, Superstar, and even the skeletons of the on and off-field character models. Not only that but this year signals the return of the popular minigames that have been missing for many years. \nHowever, one of the biggest announcements each year comes in the form of the player ratings heading into the new season.

We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist or by clicking the links below). \nBanjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it?

To the surprise of no one, though, this new look still packs in plenty of cinematic action. \nDespite the \"VI\" in the title, Fire of Rubicon serves as a reboot. The game unfolds on planet Rubicon in which its most sought-after resource, Coral, was the cause of a disaster that engulfed the planet in flames. Decades later, the now-contaminated planet has been condemned, but the rediscovery of Coral has attracted various factions, sparking a new war on the destroyed world. Players control mercenary C4-621 or \"Raven\" for short, who is thrown into this epic struggle pitting megacorporations, military forces, and other groups against each other. Based on the trailer's somber tone, it won't be pretty. \n\n\nArmored Core VI Fires of Rubicon launches on August 25 for PlayStation/Xbox consoles and PC.

          "description": "Despite launching in less than a month, we haven’t seen too much of Atlas Fallen since it was revealed nearly a year ago. A general overview video released last month gave curious players a primer on what to expect from this world of sand, magic, and monsters. Publisher Focus Entertainment has followed that up with a new gameplay-focused video breaking down the game’s combat.\nThe five-minute video shows off the action RPG's sand-shaping action. Players can equip two main weapons to alternate attacks in fast-paced combat. These include arms like a whip, axe, and even giant fists made of sand. Attacks build momentum, which raises your power and can be spent to unleash flashy special attacks. However, the higher your momentum, the more damage you take, promoting a strategic risk/reward system.\n\n\nThe video also provides a look at customization, showing off Essence Stones. There are over 150 of these skills, which range from aerial attacks to setting traps to firing projectiles. The trailer also shows off the game’s two-player online co-op. Two players can complete Atlas Fallen, including its story campaign, in its entirety together. In fact, the video states some Essence Stones promote cooperative play. \nAtlas Fallen looks promising, and developer Deck13 has a decent track record (The Surge series, Lords of the Fallen), so we hope this information dump at the eleventh hour is a sign of confidence instead of a bad omen. We look forward to seeing how it shapes up when it arrives on August 10 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

Wesley played roughly four hours of the game in a hands-on remote preview to learn more about its open world Oahu, Hawaii, various vehicles, racing playlists, Main Stage mode, and more. \nEnjoy more than 15 minutes of new gameplay from The Crew Motorsport in the latest NGT below: \n\n\nUbisoft Ivory Tower developed both 2014's The Crew and 2018's The Crew 2, and the Lyon, France-based studio returns to developer The Crew Motorfest. Unlike the first two games in the series, which feature maps spanning the entire United States, The Crew Motorfest takes place in just one state: Hawaii. The island of Oahu, Hawaii, to be specific, and it features Honolulu, plenty of beautiful beaches, mountain paths to drift through, and more. \nIn our NGT for The Crew Motorfest, we showcase some gameplay from the Vintage Garage playlist, which is a racing playlist devoted to vintage cars from as far back as the 1950s, the Made in Japan playlist, which is all about Japanese street racing, and a boat race on the ocean surrounding the island. \nFor more about The Crew Motorfest, read Game Informer's full preview here. \nThe Crew Motorfest hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on September 14, 2023. \nFor more previews and discussions of some of the biggest games of 2023 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Ra Ra Boom, Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons, Mortal Kombat 1, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, XDefiant, and Sea of Stars.\nAre you excited for The Crew Motorfest?

The FTC sought this preliminary injunction to have the court order the tech giant to cease its attempt at acquiring Activision Blizzard for a colossal $69 billion. Following the court ruling, the FTC had until July 14 to file an appeal and it did so on July 12. Judge Corley quickly denied this appeal, as expected, and now, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has also denied it, in a massiv…",

As for why, publisher Humble Games and developer Summerfall Studios says it is taking the extra week to work on performance parity across all platforms and to allow players the space to play Larian Studios’ upcoming RPG, Baldur’s Gate 3. \n\n\nHere’s what Humble Games and Summerfall Studios have to say about the Stray Gods delay: \nFor the uninitiated, Stray Gods is a hand-illustrated role-playing musical where players will decide lines in songs, similar to picking dialogue choices in an RPG. The music is composed by Grammy-nominated composer Austin Wintory (Journey, The Pathless, Assassin’s Creed Syndicate), Tripod, and Montaigne. \nThese songs are performed by a cast filled with names you might recognize, too, like Troy Baker, Ashley Johnson, Rahul Kohli, Janina Gavankar, Felicia Day, and more. Laura Bailey voices the lead, Grace, a college dropout in the game’s modern fantasy world granted the power of a Muse. This power is what Grace uses to “find out the truth behind her predecessor’s death before time runs out,” according to a press release.\nStray Gods: The Role-Playing Musical hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on August 10, 2023. \nWill you check out Stray Gods: The Role-Playing Musical next month?

That finally changes as the 1995 classic is getting spruced up for a modern, international re-release.\nFor any Americans thinking, “But we got the first Clock Tower on PlayStation,” we actually didn’t. The 1997 game known as “Clock Tower,” which did release in the West, was really Clock Tower 2 and was titled as such in Japan (watch us play it in this classic episode of Replay).\nThe actual first game arrived on Super Famicom (SNES) and stars Jennifer Simpson, an orphan adopted by the Barrows family only to find that a murderous stalker called the Scissorman is terrorizing their mansion. As a point-and-click adventure, you use a mouse cursor to guide Jennifer and interact with your surroundings to solve puzzles and find clues while evading the Scissorman. The game also features multiple endings. Clock Tower is considered one of the forefathers of survival horror and has been ported to different platforms, such as PC and the Wii/Wii U eShops, several times in Japan. \n\n\nWayforward is handling this port, which is being made using Limited Run Games’ Carbon Engine. As discussed in the developer diary video above, improvements include the game's first official English localization (along with multiple language options), a new animated intro, motion-comic cutscenes, and a new vocalized theme song by famed anime and Silent Hill singer Mary McGlynn. It also includes an art gallery, save states, and other modern tweaks. \nClock Tower is coming early next year for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC. Limited Run Games is also releasing premium physical versions of the game.",

Wesley played through the demo multiple times, using each character to take down AI and robots alike. He, Marcus, and Kyle discuss the game's visual style, use of lanes in combat, fully-voiced characters, and more. \nEnjoy roughly 12 minutes of all new Ra Ra Boom gameplay in the latest NGT below: \n\n\nIn 2008, Chris Bergman, who later co-founded Gylee Games and now works as its CEO, bought the domain to raraboom.com. Today, that site takes you to the Steam page for Ra Ra Boom, the beat 'em up featured in our latest installment of New Gameplay Today. Gylee Games started work on the game back in 2019, before the resurgence of beat 'em up games, but Bergman is stoked about said resurgence. He calls it a \"rising tides raise all ships\" scenario. \nAfter playing through this demo multiple times, I'm excited for Ra Ra Boom's full release. Its inclusion of lanes has fixed my largest problem with beat 'em ups: my inability to properly target and hit enemies. Add in the fully voiced characters, beautiful art style, fun cast of ninja cheerleaders, and an emphasis on story that's somewhat rare in the genre, and I'm ready to smash some robots. \nRa Ra Boom hits PC early next year.\nFor more previews and discussions of some of the biggest games of 2023 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons, Mortal Kombat 1, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective, Eternights, Bramble: The Mountain King, Humanity, Afterimage, Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster Collection, XDefiant, Sea of Stars, and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.\nEditor's Note: This article has been updated to reflect that Ra Ra Boom will launch early 2024. \nAre you going to check out Ra Ra Boom later this year?

The upcoming ghost-busting adventure has a new trailer revealing a November 7 launch date. \nThe game stars Antea Duarte and Red mac Raith, two lovers who serve as Banishers, those who protect the living from the lingering spirits of the dead. Unfortunately, Antea has become a ghost herself and must work alongside Red to find a way to bring herself back to life. Along the way, they’ll explore New Eden, a North American settlement teeming with supernatural dangers, and player combat threats using Red’s conventional weaponry and Antea’s spectral abilities. Players will also interact with New Eden’s residents in choice-driven conversations that steer the course of the narrative, namely in deciding whether to fulfill their duty as a Banisher or sacrifice that oath to restore Antea’s mortality.  \n\n\nBanishers: Ghosts of New Eden will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

Wesley played through one of the stages in the game to get a feel for how classic fighters Billy and Jimmy feel and the three discuss their thoughts on these characters, the visual style, the combat, and more.\nEnjoy nearly 10 minutes of new Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons gameplay in the latest NGT below: \n\n\nDeveloper Secret Base and publisher Modus Games announced Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons earlier this summer with a special trailer that you can watch here. The game is set in New York City after it's been destroyed by nuclear war. Brawlers Billy and Jimmy set out to take back what remains from the violent gangs that have since taken over. However, they won't be doing it alone because the game features a roster of 13 playable fighters, including love interest Marian, newcomer Uncle Matin, and more. \nSecret Base says the beat 'em up features \"seamless tag team abilities and a multitude of strategies for devastating combos, defensive, and offensive moves.\" Players can swap characters on the fly, which you can see in the NGT above, as needed in combat. \nDouble Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on July 27. It will feature two-player local co-op at launch. Online co-op is set to arrive later in a post-launch update. \nFor more previews and discussions of some of the biggest games of 2023 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Mortal Kombat 1, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective, Eternights, Bramble: The Mountain King, Humanity, Afterimage, Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster Collection, XDefiant, Sea of Stars, and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.\nAre you going to check out Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons later this month?

And in that trailer, you can hear a tease of his original track, “Splintered Minds.” \nCheck out “Splintered Minds” in the latest Stray Souls trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Yamaoka’s track sounds great, and Silent Hill fans know this is probably just a taste of some excellent music from the famed composer. The trailer also reveals plenty more Stray Souls gameplay, which features third-person gunplay, some stealth elements, and plenty of terrifying monsters. \nStray Souls hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via Steam this fall. \nAre you going to check out Stray Souls later this year?

          "description": "Today, a California judge denied the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's request for a preliminary injunction in its case to block Microsoft and Xbox from acquiring Activision Blizzard. Now, shortly after the ruling, Microsoft has announced it will pause its appeal efforts against the Competition and Markets Authority in the U.K. so that it and the CMA can negotiate. \nBack in April, the UK regulatory body blocked Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard over cloud gaming concerns. With a July 18 deadline for the acquisition, Microsoft theoretically needs to either mark the U.K. out of its market as it relates to this purchase or negotiate a deal with the CMA to quell the regulator's concerns. Microsoft was previously set to appear in court to appeal the CMA's block on July 28. According to Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith, that won't be happening now as the two parties will instead attempt to negotiate a deal that satisfies both. \nOur statement on the mutual request with the CMA for a pause of our appeal in the UK: pic.twitter.com/8Aky2IJjxS\nJuly 11, 2023\nIt's important to note that the Competition Appeal Tribunal still needs to either approve or deny this request, as noted by The Verge, but the former seems incredibly likely. In a statement received by The Verge, the CMA said it is \"ready to consider any proposals from Microsoft to restructure the transaction in a way that would address the concerns set our in our Final Report,\" likely alluding to its concerns over cloud gaming (concerns that Microsoft disagrees with). \nGame Informer has reached out to the CMA for a statement regarding Smith's announcement and will update the story if a comment or statement is received. \nWhat do you think this means for Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard?

          "description": "Tuatara Games has revealed its next project, and it’s a sci-fi survival shoot ‘em up called Let Them Come: Onslaught. \nTuatara Games has released games before – it released Bare Butt Boxing this May – but it’s perhaps best known for its work as a AAA VFX support studio working on games like Valorant, Fortnite, Godfall, and more. It’s set to release Let Them Come: Onslaught on PC via Steam Early Access in the first quarter of 2024. Let Them Come: Onslaught puts players behind the gun of a lone survivor on an alien planet who must survive hordes of creatures by activating nukes to blow up the planet. \nCheck out the teaser trailer for Let Them Come: Onslaught for yourself below:\n\n\nTuatara Games says the game features dynamic weather, and a wide range of weapons, including a flamethrower, laser beam, electric grenade, orbital strikes, and more. As you mow down hordes of aliens, you can upgrade your soldier with increased health, defense, reduced weapon cooldowns, and shields you can activate on the battlefield. To obtain these upgrades, you spend XP you earn on each run.\n“We are huge fans of this emerging gameplay experience, and are thrilled to reveal our love letter to the games that inspired us,” Tuatara Games founder Klemen Lozar writes in a press release. “Using our team’s VFX expertise, survivors can expect to fight for their lives through adrenaline-inducing experiences that have the best visuals of the genre.” \n\nLet Them Come: Onslaught also features roguelite elements, meaning a lot will be lost in between each run. However, credits collected on the battlefield stay with you, and you can spend them on permanent upgrades in the Armory. \nTuatara Games says Let Them Come: Onslaught hits Steam Early Access sometime in Q1 of 2024. It will cost $4.99. The team says, “The decision to launch first on Early Access comes from [the] continued knowledge in incorporating improvements to ensure the final 1.0 launch is as optimized as possible.”",

The fifth iteration was long-presumed to be in-development, but during the UFC's tentpole International Fight Week event over the weekend, EA Sports and the UFC made it official. While no additional details were revealed outside of the logo, we know that a full reveal is coming in September of this year.\nEA Sports UFC 5 marks the longest gap between entries since the series' introduction. Since the first EA Sports UFC game arrived in 2014, the games have arrived every two years, with UFC 2 arriving in 2016, UFC 3 in 2018, and UFC 4 in 2020. The series has traditionally been developed by EA Vancouver, so that's the expectation with this entry as well, but no official confirmation has been provided by EA one way or the other on that front. EA Sports UFC 5 will also mark the first game in the series to launch since the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S hit the market, so we might be able to expect a leap forward in terms of graphical fidelity and/or performance.\nEA Sports UFC 4 launched on August 14, 2020, and introduced various customization options, as well as new grappling and takedown physics, plus a more fleshed-out single-player career mode. EA Sports has also continually updated the game's roster, adding tens of new fighters to the game in the time since its launch, with the most recent free update featuring Jack Della Maddalena, Erin Blanchfield, and Brandon Royval arriving just last week. For more on our thoughts on EA Sports UFC 4, check out our review here.\nWe'll learn more about EA Sports UFC 5 in September, but in the meantime, what do you hope is fixed, improved upon, or included in the next game?

          "description": "EA has announced that a Black Panther game is in the works. The title is being made by Cliffhanger Games, a new triple-A studio based in Seattle, in collaboration with Marvel Games.\nThe upcoming title is billed as a single-player story-driven third-person action-adventure game. In a press release, Cliffhanger states that “Our mission is to build an expansive and reactive world that empowers players to experience what it is like to take on the mantle of Wakanda’s protector, the Black Panther.”\nCliffhanger is led by Kevin Stephens, formerly of Monolith Productions (a studio currently making a Wonder Woman game), and consists of veteran talent who have worked on titles such as Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, God of War, Halo Infinite, and Call of Duty, among others. The team is still being assembled and is actively hiring. As such, this untitled Black Panther project is very early in development, so it will be a few years before it’s in our hands. \n“We’re dedicated to delivering fans a definitive and authentic Black Panther experience, giving them more agency and control over their narrative than they have ever experienced in a story-driven video game. Wakanda is a rich SuperHero sandbox, and our mission is to develop an epic world for players who love Black Panther and want to explore the world of Wakanda as much as we do,” said Kevin.\nBlack Panther made his comic debut in July 1966, and today’s news coincides with the character’s 57th anniversary. Although he’s been a playable character in numerous Marvel titles, he’s never starred in his own solo game until now. However, it's not the only upcoming game to let players assume the Black Panther mantle. Last year, Amy Hennig's Skydance New Media announced it’s making a Marvel game set during World War II starring Captain America, Black Panther Azzuri (the grandfather of T’Challa), alongside another Wakandan spy and Howling Commando member Gabriel Jones. \nTo keep up with other upcoming superhero games, we've made a list of them for you to check out here.",

          "description": "Sonic the Hedgehog co-creator Yuji Naka has been given a suspended prison sentence for insider trading.\nNews of this sentencing comes from IGN (via IGN Japan), which reports that the 57-year-old was \"found guilty of violating Japan's Financial Instruments and Exchange Act\" for insider trading after a July 7 court appearance at the Tokyo District Court. The judge in the case gave Naka a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence but suspended for four years, and two fines of 2 million yen and 170 million yen (approximately $14,000 and $1.1 million respectively). \nThis sentencing comes roughly a month after Abema Times reported in June that prosecutors on the case were asking that Naka go to prison for two years and six months and fines totaling roughly $1.2 million. However, Naka's defense asked that this fine and prison sentence be reduced. The final verdict arrived on July 7 in Japan. \nNaka, who also directed Balan Wonderworld, was arrested in November in connection to an insider trading investigation centered around a new Dragon Quest game. Naka was accused of purchasing 10,000 shares worth 2.8 million yen (roughly $20,000) in Aiming, the company behind that new mobile Dragon Quest game. \nLess than a month later, Naka was arrested once more on a second charge of insider trading; this time involving the now-defunct mobile battle royale, Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier. Naka was accused of purchasing 120,000 shares in Ateam, the developer behind the game, for approximately 144.7 million yen (more than $1 million). \nNaka has now been formally charged and sentenced for insider trading. \n[Source: IGN via IGN Japan]",

And of course, this was Adibou's first appearance! Although the floppy release has him speak the same strange gibberish as heard in the Goblins series, he is still the patient and funny learning partner that he's remembered for being in later games.\nScummVM supports all of the game's releases, from the initial 16-color floppy ones to later 1994 CD versions with richer graphics and sound effects. So dig out your dusty Adibou disks, get a ScummVM daily development build, and start collecting sweets while completing math and reading exercises! Please also contact us if you own a version ScummVM is not yet aware of, and report to the issue tracker any problem you may encounter.\nAs much as ScummVM aims to replicate the original gaming experience, there is one feature we are unfortunately unable to support. When hardworking children complete their virtual sweets collection, a message invites them to mail a floppy disk with their savegame to Coktel Vision, who would send them a parcel containing Coktel goodies and actual sweets! So if you are introducing children to Adibou through ScummVM, be prepared to go to the nearest shop and buy some candy for when they finish the game!\n>",

In the first post, we went into a bit into the infrastructure that runs OpenTTD, from BaNaNaS to our main website. In this post, we will explain a bit about the migration we just did to get to this infrastructure. After over 2 months of work, I am happy to announce we finished (another) infrastructure migration. Today is the day I removed the last few DNS entries pointing to AWS’s DNS servers, and I am proud to mention that (almost) all traffic is now routed via Cloudflare (and we aren’t even receiving sponsoring to say so). In this post I want to take you with me why this migration was needed, what the benefits are, and why you possibly care. But in short summary: (Much) smaller monthly bill as AWS charges insane amounts for bandwidth. Faster download speeds for you (ranging from the in-game content service to downloading the game from our website). Easier maintainability of our infrastructure with thanks to Pulumi.

The second post will explain a bit about the migration we just did to get to this infrastructure. Often I get comments that people are surprised how complex OpenTTD’s infrastructure is, and why that is. With this post, I will try to explain a bit what is going on in the backend, and why it takes a bit of effort to keep everything running smoothly.",
