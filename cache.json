To the north, the Cao Wei state has been founded, led by Cao Pi after the death of his father.

Meanwhile, the Wu state controls much of the region’s eastern coastline.\nThe Three Kingdoms period is one of the most fascinating and dramatic in recorded history and has become fodder for countless stories and games over the years. Koei Tecmo's Romance of the Three Kingdoms series, named after the 14th-century Chinese novel about the events, puts players in control of these warring states, tasked with uniting a fractured China through a combination of political, economic, and military campaigns.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

And it shows in a recent report acquired by Gamebiz.jp (via Noisy Pixel), as the developer has almost doubled its profits in the fiscal year ending March 2023.\nAccording to the Official Gazette's financial report, the RPG developer — which also helps Nintendo with many of its big releases, including The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom — made 800 million yen in the year starting 1st April 2022 and ending 31st March 2023. In contrast, the previous fiscal year saw the company make around 404 million yen. That's an increase of 97.8%, which is pretty staggering.

That's all. So. I will not be playing Diablo 4 this weekend. What are you playing this weekend? Here's what we are clicking on!\nRead more",

Mars First Logistics is a game about designing little moon rover buggies to pick things up and drive them to somewhere else.\nIf you looked at it and went \"ooh\", your coo lobe was right. \"Design a vehicle\" games are often too fiddly and/or competition-oriented for me, and trucking games too businesslike and grounded. This threads the needle beautifully. It's challenging, but gently, prioritising an approachable design and smooth controls without sacrificing the satisfaction of solving a decent engineering puzzle. It's even pretty, so that even plain driving back and forth is pleasant and rewarding.\nRead more",

I don’t usually go for nails Metriodvanias, but there’s something about Gunbrella’s slick, parkour platforming and scrappy world that made me wanna give it a chance. Oh, and the deadly brolly, of course. I mean, it’s a gunbrella. What else is there to say?\nThe demo I played at PAX is now available to download and play on Steam, and I highly recommend it. Even if you’re a bit like me and Metriodvanias aren’t really your thing, the hour-long demo is entirely linear, and messing around with the gunbrella's many, many abilities is more than a good enough reason to have a play, even if you're just mucking around.\nRead more",

This month's game has been chosen by yours truly and I'm very much in the mood to revisit a comfy, cosy puzzle game so I've chosen Unpacking. Cue the confetti!\nUnpacking is a puzzle game that's all about pulling your homewares and personal items out of cardboard moving boxes and placing them in a new home. It's best described as a relaxing house moving sim but it's also a sort of block-fitting puzzle game. Finding the perfect spot for each item is largely down to your own personal taste, but there are some loose 'room rules' (no, you cannot put your toaster in the bedroom for some midnight cheese toastie action). If you like organising games - A Little To The Left, Sticky Business, Wilmot's Warehouse and the like - then Unpacking is the game for you.\nRead more",

He spent a full three minutes surveying the pockmarked, potentially lethal landscape from above with a drone, marking the most dangerous terrain in advance and picking out a relatively safe route between the checkpoints. “Alright,” he thought. “I’m going to smash this stage.”\r\n\n\r\nOf course, it’s just as they say: no plan survives contact with unroaded planets wracked by extreme temperatures, meteor showers and atmospheric pressure unlike anything ever experienced on Earth. On the corner of the first checkpoint, Lindsay flipped his rover, snagging the vehicle on a rock that immediately broke his scanning systems and left him driving blind. By the time of our chat, though, he’s laughing. Exo Rally Championship is a racer for those who like to roll with the punches, quite literally - an anecdote generator for players who adore the challenge of preparing for the worst, and then adapting to changing circumstances on the fly.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Players will be able to go head to head with two of the game's four factions - the golden fantasy knights of the Stormcast Eternals and the sneaky green stink lads of the Orruk Kruleboyz - giving us our first taste of how they'll handle in battle, and the kinds of powerplays we'll be making with their respective (and rather handsome) tabletop miniature recreations. \nAnd having played four rounds of its 1v1 matches already at a press event last week, it's quite the thrill - and I say that as someone with no real attachment to Warhammer or Age Of Sigmar's specific lore legacy. The Stormcast Eternals and their flying hammer brutes are just as devastating as you'd imagine, while the lads lads lads and their Killaboss Kruleboyz are challenging late-game bloomers that will give even hardened strategy game veterans plenty to sink their teeth into. Both factions are great fun, and I'm very much looking forward to jumping back in this weekend.\nRead more",

          "description": "Thrilling as it may be to swing a lightsaber or shoot a headcrab in stereoscopic 3D, the VR experiences I crave most are those which use the tech to fold my brain into entirely new shapes. 2019's A Fisherman's Tale was one of those. An unassuming first-person puzzler about a puppet fisherman living in a lighthouse, it dazzled with its incredible deployment of VR's unique sense of perspective and scale. It's the kind of game that, if it featured a psychotic AI and some cake memes instead of a beard in a yellow anorak, would have been heralded as a revolution in play.\r\n\n\r\nIt would have been easy to follow-up A Fisherman's Tale in the same way, make a bigger game with a few new gimmicks and a comedy lobster voiced by Stephen Merchant. But that isn't what developer InnerspaceVR has done. Instead, Another Fisherman's Tale bends your neural pathways in entirely new forms, offering a completely different kind of puzzling. The results are equally innovative and almost as interactively satisfying - although a lack of refinement in the latter category is a deflating puncture in the game's dinghy.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Flock is the next game from the makers of Wilmot's Warehouse, Hohokum and I Am Dead, but ever since it was announced last year, I've been wondering about exactly what kind of game it is. The first trailer revealed lots of strange, whimsical environments, equally whimsical-looking beasties and a little person flying around on the back of a giant bird herding them around in delightful swoops and swirls. We also saw some sheep grazing in a meadow before they, too, started to fly alongside your wilder, more abstract animal pals. But the question of what you do in Flock remained unanswered - until last week, when developers Hollow Ponds showed us a little bit more of their creature collecting game during the Annapurna Interactive Showcase stream.\nThere, they revealed that we'll need to collect and charm these creatures to get them to join our respective flocks, and that we'll be able to do so in co-op with a pal. It looks intensely charming, but it still left me with lots of unanswered questions. So I spoke to devs Ricky Haggett and Richard Hogg to find out more. Naturally, there are some things they're not ready to reveal about Flock just yet, but they did tell me that you'll start on top of a mountain and will be wending your way down it with your flock of sheep. \nRead more",

Haha, that's a joke: you don't have a choice. As I said, you're locked in here unless you can find the Resident Evil-ass key I have hidden in here somewhere.

What if, instead of building up villages and hunting down hostile monsters and evil overlords, you were playing as the Dark Lord?\nIt's been done most famously in Dungeon Keeper or Overlord, but those were quite conventional structurally. Sure, you were playing as the baddies, but still doing mostly the same things as in other games, twirling your moustache the whole time. Ruinarch feels not like one of those thematic remixes of an established structure, but an attempt to build a new subgenre. Now that it's reached a full release, it also, sadly, feels like a demonstration of how difficult that really is.\nRead more",

It's always going to be a work-in-progress, but I think I've settled into a language learning routine which leaves me with plenty of time for Love Island in the evening. DuoLingo's owl has been punted to the curb, too, because the bird is awful.\nNaturally, I've turned to a textbook: Genki I. At first I thought there was no getting past it being a bit dry - I mean they aren't meant to be thrillers, are they? Until, that was, I discovered Game Gengo, a YouTuber who takes each lesson from the textbook, breaks them down into manageable chunks, all complete with loads of examples from video games.

And what's the deal with these newfound powers he has to turn back time and manipulate inanimate objects in his vicinity? That definitely wasn't in the ghostbusting 101 manual. Alas, he doesn't have long to find out, as he'll cross over to the afterlife in the morning.

          "description": "Is he related to the Berenstein Bears?\nUh oh. It looks like CERN may have fired again. We're now in a timeline graced by the existence of Fiddlebert. Of course, you remember Fiddlebert from Pikmin, right? For those that don't; Fiddlebert was supposedly Pikmin 1's second captain. He was \"rushed\" since he was just a smaller and green version of Olimar. He would sometimes randomly speak another language and was removed from the Wii and Switch ports of the game...at least, that's what folks on the Pikmin subreddit would have you believe.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Pikmin/comments/14pn5qe/who_the_fuck_is_fiddlebert/\nPikmin fans are currently debating the existence of the green character. Some claim they certainly remember him from the original Pikmin. But let's be honest here. Fiddlebert is as real as Curious George's tail, Oscar Meyer, and the Monopoly Man's monocle. You know, as real as the cornucopia in the Fruit of the Loom logo.\n[caption id=\"attachment_390706\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Nat on Cohost[/caption]\nDo you \"remember\" Fiddlebert?\nThe creation of Fiddlebert is what happens when a dedicated fan base gets together and wants to pass the time before a highly anticipated game release. We saw a similar situation in the Diablo 4 community. It's honestly great! You have a large group of people all excited for Pikmin 4 and willing to take something silly and run with it. Why you might ask? Because it's fun, it's entertaining, and most importantly it's more Pikmin.\nLook, I know the Mandela effect is a real thing. I mean at this point who can argue it? But I have to admit, I don't remember Fiddlebert ever existing. Maybe I just didn't play Pikmin as much as I remember, but surely I'd recognize this green Olimar, right?\nPikmin 4 releases on Nintendo Switch on July 21. I'm willing to bet Fiddlebert will not make an appearance.\nThe post Who is Pikmin’s “Fiddlebert?” An investigation appeared first on Destructoid.",

Of course, the next stage of that campaign: My Nintendo swag!\nAs you may recall, Nintendo celebrated the re-release Pikmin 3 in 2020 with a sticker and coaster set. Well, in a recent news post on the My Nintendo site, the publisher confirmed that there will be a sticker set coming in the future for Pikmin 4. Here's the full rundown from Nintendo:\n\"Add some cuteness to your smooth surfaces with these lovely 3” x 3” stickers! One features a Blue Pikmin, a Yellow Pikmin, and a Red Pikmin ready for whatever’s next. The other shows an explorer and a squad of Pikmin riding on the back of space dog Oatchi.\"\n\nGiven the timeframe of prior announcements, it could be anywhere between 1-2 weeks until we see the set go up on the My Nintendo storefront. Expect the price to be in line with prior sticker sets on the service, ranging from 300-500 Platinum Points.\nThere's also a Pikmin 4 demo promo for free Platinum\nIn other My Nintendo news, there's a Pikmin 4 retailer demo promo going on soon, which can net you 200 Platinum Points.\nAll you need to do is play the demo of the game at select retailers, then scan a QR code at the end. That's it! This particular gimmick will be running from July 7 through October 19, so you have plenty of time. Nintendo mentions Best Buy, GameStop, Target, and Walmart by name.\nUpdate (July 7, 2023) - The Pikmin 4 stickers are now available\nGood news! The stickers became available in record time. You can find them right here for 200 Platinum Points.\nRemember that you can bundle multiple items together so you aren't paying standard shipping for a few stickers.\nThe post The Pikmin 4 My Nintendo reward is…stickers appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Sega shouldn't have done what Nintendidn't\nBloomberg has reported that Sega is pulling back its plans to compete in the Web3 Thunderdome. The company was previously shoveling coal into the crypto furnace; licensing blockchain games, and creating NFTs based on its properties.\nSega hasn’t canceled all of its crypto plans, but we’re watching in real time as the corporation realizes its mistake. Bloomberg reports that Sega “will withhold its biggest franchises from third-party blockchain gaming projects to avoid devaluing its content.” “We’re looking into whether this technology is really going to take off in this industry, after all,” co-Chief Operating Officer Shuji Utsumi told Bloomberg News. Sega will apparently be pulling back from play-to-earn games and is reassessing its Web3 approach to the company's big-budget online multiplayer-focused so-called “super games” that are planned to start releasing in 2026.\nThis, of course, is all in response to the ongoing decline in the crypto market that some have dubbed the \"Crypto Winter.\" The unfortunate part of this is that it’s largely a case of big executives and billionaires buying into an obvious scam, and many of them won’t really see any consequences for the poor decision-making. Instead, it's the people below them that will get the brunt of it. Meta laid off 10,000 employees when it became apparent that the Metaverse was a Web3 black hole that it was dropping money into. What a world.\nThankfully, no layoffs have been announced for Sega, but considering the blockchain plans were announced in 2021 following a low sales forecast… I don’t want to think about it.\nThe post Sega hits the brakes on its blockchain plans appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "From the mind that brought us Silent Hill\nFor all you horror fans out there, Bokeh Game Studio has uploaded a video diary for the upcoming Slitterhead. This is a brand-new psychological horror game from Keiichirō Toyama, better known as the creator of the first Silent Hill.\nIn this latest video, the developer gives a brief behind-the-scenes look at the tests that have been done on an early build of Slitterhead. In the footage, we are treated to a few details about the work done so far, which includes some brief glimpses from the game (keep in mind that it's still very much in early development).\nhttps://youtu.be/XYrOO0SLUAI\nAs well as this sneak peek of the project, we're also told that the game will feature \"unique mechanics,\" which have apparently gone down quite well with testers so far. What these mechanics actually are is a mystery. In fact, there's still not a huge amount known about Slitterhead, including when it's likely to release. Given that it's still in the early stages, it's probably going to be a while.\nA new horror awaits\nBokeh Game Studio was founded in 2020 by Toyama after his departure from Sony. He also brought onboard Junya Okura and Kazunobu Sato, both of whom he worked with on the cult horror series Siren. Slitterhead will be the new team's maiden release.\nRight now is an exciting time to be a horror fan. Whether it's remakes of classics or...well, okay, there are a lot of remakes at the moment. But the ones that have come about over the last few years have been pretty good.\nThere are also some great games on the indie scene, such as Iron Lung, not to mention the new Amnesia game has been scaring the pants off people. So the genre is very much alive, and a lot of you will be looking forward to what Bokeh has to offer, especially given it has the director of the OG Silent Hill at the helm.\nThe post Silent Hill creator’s horror game Slitterhead will have ‘unique mechanics,’ demos early footage appeared first on Destructoid.",

Both were similar titles that take the Kunio-Kun/Downtown/Nekketsu/River City beat-’em-up formula started in 1986’s Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun/Renegade and cemented in 1989’s Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari/River City Ransom. Chubby arms, pained expressions, and lots of smacking take center stage in these games.\nhttps://youtu.be/-DMyaNUrF4o\nThe new port of River City: Rival Showdown will include all the features of the 3DS version but will also include a brand new prequel story called Cold-Blooded Hardcore Yamada-kun. Beyond that, there will also be spiffier graphics and some quality-of-life improvements.\nI’d call myself a huge fan of the Kunio-Kun/Downtown/Nekketsu/River City games, but I’ve had trouble getting myself into the more modern titles. I own River City: Rival Showdown on 3DS. I just couldn’t tell you why I haven’t played more than a few minutes of it.\nOh, wait, yes, I can. It was a horrible time in my life. I wish I hadn’t remembered that.\nIn any case, I’ll hopefully be giving this one another chance. If you haven’t already, you should definitely check out Double Dragon & Kunio-kun: Retro Brawler Bundle. It has all the Famicom games in the Kunio-Kun/Downtown/Nekketsu/River City series, but they’ve gone the extra mile and localized all the ones that were previously Japan-only.

The headline feature here is a new religion system, but it also promises paper industry and guild halls.\nFarthest Frontier is coming up on a year in early access. It’s a “colony sim” or a “survival city builder.” This burgeoning sub-genre has followed in the wake of the success of 2014’s Banished. It seems a lot of developers felt tired of waiting for a sequel to Banished and have decided to create their own sequels, each tying in a different twist. The base is that you need to focus on the survival of your settlers, but from there, the concept has gone in some interesting directions.\nI’ve actually played Farthest Frontier, and while it’s not as big of a twist as Timberborn’s beaver people, it’s definitely a solid game, even in its current state. It’s detailed, pretty, and has that nice mix of relaxing and stressful.\nHowever, there’s room to expand, and religion sounds like it will be a great addition. Nothing livens up a peasant’s sad existence quite like the fear of an unhappy deity. The central mechanic of religion is finding relics that will “inspire reverence” and provide your people with perks. Personally, I prefer a good sacrifice, but this sounds good too.\nThere is also the introduction of the paper industry, which will allow you to create books; a luxury item for your settlers. There are also guild halls that will boost a chosen industry in your settlement, allowing you to pick your focus. In the future, Crate Entertainment is teasing tweaks to combat, quality of life, mods, and the addition of new livestock. Hopefully ducks.\nFarthest Frontier is currently available on PC via Early Access. The update is planned for release in August.\nThe post Farthest Frontier shows off its big August update appeared first on Destructoid.",

Today's new trailer for Mortal Kombat 1 reveals both Rain and Smoke will appear in the new entry.\nSmoke is a well-liked member of the Lin Kuei, who finally gets a human re-debut in Liu Kang's new era. Here, Smoke is a fellow member of the Lin Kuei who joins with Scorpion and Sub-Zero to defend Earthrealm.\nAlso arriving is Rain, a High Mage of Outworld who wields water magic. He's looking a bit more robed and wizard-like, compared to his original palette-swapped appearance.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66opZ1Go_ZA\nSome Kameo fighters also make an appearance here, too. Scorpion pops up, of course. But the cyborg side of the Lin Kuei appears, too; Sektor and Cyrax are in as Kameos, as well as a human version of Frost.\nFor our two main roster fighters, both look pretty excellent. Smoke is obviously a highlight. His teleportation and quick jabs look fantastic, and that knife looks devastating in the X-ray attacks. Rain, meanwhile, is like a Waterbender that gets to actually do some damage with their aquatic magic. I really dig the big lightning ball attack that he can call down from a raincloud.\nKombat history\nThe Kameo fighters bring their own flavor too, and it's nice to see the cyborgs appear. I was curious about whether they would. With a new era and re-envisioned versions of characters, having the robo-fighters reappear or not felt up in the air.\nAfter playing it at SGF 2023, though, it definitely seemed like Kameos are NetherRealm's way of including more fan-favorites from its ever-expanding universe without having to make them fully fledged fighters right away. If it keeps up the nostalgia and klassic references, I could see this being a really enjoyable experience for long-time MK fans.\nMortal Kombat 1 arrives on September 19, 2023.\nThe post Mortal Kombat 1 trailer unleashes Smoke, Rain, and more Kameos appeared first on Destructoid.",

Thank the Gods of Visual Clarity for that.\nMotion blur is one of those modern visual effects that some people don’t like. For example, I don’t like motion blur. In racing games, maybe, but essentially not any other time. Along with chromatic aberration and depth-of-field blur, it’s one of those things that developers really should allow you to turn off.

The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey. \nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

          "description": "Sonic the Hedgehog co-creator Yuji Naka has been given a suspended prison sentence for insider trading.\nNews of this sentencing comes from IGN (via IGN Japan), which reports that the 57-year-old was \"found guilty of violating Japan's Financial Instruments and Exchange Act\" for insider trading after a July 7 court appearance at the Tokyo District Court. The judge in the case gave Naka a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence but suspended for four years, and two fines of 2 million yen and 170 million yen (approximately $14,000 and $1.1 million respectively). \nThis sentencing comes roughly a month after Abema Times reported in June that prosecutors on the case were asking that Naka go to prison for two years and six months and fines totaling roughly $1.2 million. However, Naka's defense asked that this fine and prison sentence be reduced. The final verdict arrived on July 7 in Japan. \nNaka, who also directed Balan Wonderworld, was arrested in November in connection to an insider trading investigation centered around a new Dragon Quest game. Naka was accused of purchasing 10,000 shares worth 2.8 million yen (roughly $20,000) in Aiming, the company behind that new mobile Dragon Quest game. \nLess than a month later, Naka was arrested once more on a second charge of insider trading; this time involving the now-defunct mobile battle royale, Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier. Naka was accused of purchasing 120,000 shares in Ateam, the developer behind the game, for approximately 144.7 million yen (more than $1 million). \nNaka has now been formally charged and sentenced for insider trading. \n[Source: IGN via IGN Japan]",

The following year, at The Game Awards 2021, Bokeh revealed Slitterhead. Thanks to a new development diary released today, we can peek at more early-development gameplay in action. \nMost of the video focuses on the developers working on Slitterhead, with a particular look at user tests and gameplay feedback. However, sprinkled throughout the diary are new clips of Slitterhead, ranging from training room-esque encounters, some clips of a neon-lit Chinese city, and even a dog that appears to be playable. \nCheck it out for yourself: \n\n\nAs you can see in the small and often blurred snippets of Slitterhead gameplay, the studio's debut game continues to look grotesque. We see a character attack enemies using Wolverine-like claws, guns, and more. Oh, and below is that playable dog: \nIn 2020, the studio said its debut horror game would be released in 2023. But there's no word on whether the team still anticipates releasing it this year.

That gets remedied a bit with the announcement that Stadium Stampede is hitting the game in an upcoming free update. \nStadium Stampede sees up to 30 wrestlers compete in a free-for-all inside a giant empty stadium. Like the real-life version, insanity is the name of the game, as players can assault each other using whatever is around them, whether it's chairs, tee shirt guns, Molotovs, golf carts, or even ride atop a horse. The last competitor standing wins, and the reveal trailer sells how much of a goofy mess it’s going to be (in a good way, hopefully). \n\n\nUnfortunately, there's no release date for this update other than that it's coming soon. AEW: Fight Forever has other DLC heading its way in the form of downloadable wrestler packs. FTR (Dax Harwood and Cash Wheeler) were added last month, and a pack containing Keith Lee and The Bunny becomes available on July 25.

While wearing a Yoshi costume, no less.\n“The head was vacuum-formed, but Yoshi’s whole body was solid foam,” adds Kathy Lawrence, the costume designer responsible for creating the mascots for dozens of Nintendo’s TV spots in the ʼ90s and 2000s.\n“It went from a costume that weighed about 35 pounds to over 200 pounds,” Fireball says. “The foam, like a sponge, just absorbed the water, and I just started to sink.” Mistaking his outreached hand for a thumbs up, Kathy and the crew were excited as they watched her husband fight for his life underwater.

          "description": "If Ubisoft's summer showcase was any indication, it's going all-in on Assassin's Creed. But a recent report from Kotaku suggests that the company's commitment to the franchise might be going even deeper than we thought; Ubisoft has recently begun the process of remaking Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. \nThe remake is currently in \"its earliest stages,\" Kotaku reports, so details are scarce, and we won't be seeing it officially for a few years. A team at Ubisoft Singapore, a branch that has contributed to almost every mainline Assassin's Creed game, is said to be heavily involved. Most notably, Ubisoft Singapore worked on the creation of naval combat for Assassin's Creed III and IV, a success that would place it at the head of development for Ubisoft's naval-focused game, Skull and Bones. Of course, Skull and Bones is now notorious for its years of repeated delays – fans of Black Flag will just have to hope the seas will be calmer for the studio's next project.\n\n\nBlack Flag was released in 2013 on the eve of a new console generation, coming to PS3 and 360, but also to PS4, Xbox One, and Wii U. The game follows Edward Kenway – the pirate grandfather of the protagonist Connor from Assassin's Creed III – as he plunders the Caribbean and stumbles into the Assassin Brotherhood. Combining the series' classic stealth gameplay with naval exploration and combat, it's widely regarded as one of the franchise's best entries. Check out our review here.\n[Source: Kotaku]\nAre you interested in a remake of Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag? Let us know in the comments!",

Instead, the acronym is confusingly shorthand for Reach for the Moon.

As a strange humanoid creature, you’ll explore a labyrinthian H.R. Giger-inspired alien world to unravel its mysteries. While combat is present, it’s very much secondary to deciphering the abstract story and riddles, and even those revelations will primarily be up to your interpretation. \nThe PlayStation 5 version features DualSense haptic feedback support and 4K/60 fps gameplay.

And now we know that game is Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth. As the name suggests, it takes place in 2033, which puts it between the original film and its sequel, Blade Runner 2049. Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth takes place in a dystopian Los Angeles like its cinematic predecessors, and the game's events occur after the Blackout hits. \nNot much else was revealed about the game, but you can check out its moody cinematic trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, this game looks very Blade Runner, and we can't wait to learn more about it. Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth's development is led by game director Chelsea Hash, who previously served as the director of Solar Ash and technical art lead on What Remains of Edith Finch. \nAnnapurna Interactive says Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth is the first new Blade Runner game for consoles and PC in development in 25 years. It's due out sometime in the future on consoles and PC, but there's no word on when to expect it.

Ever since 2004, EA Sports' annualized Madden NFL series has been the exclusive franchise for the NFL, its teams, stadiums, and players. The result was the closure of other franchises, such as the competitive NFL 2K series, as well as the arcade-focused NFL Blitz franchise (which was later acquired by EA in 2011). The recently announced Wild Card Football from Saber Interactive, part of the Playgrounds franchise, hopes to smash through the established line to give players a fresh 7-on-7 arcade-facing take on the sport starring their favorite players.\nWild Card Football doesn't possess the NFL license, but rather the NFLPA license.

          "description": "While game delays have become commonplace, the opposite is extremely rare. Today, we learned Baldur's Gate 3 is somehow doing both at the same time. Initially planned for August 31, developer Larian Studios is advancing the PC release date to August 3 while delaying the PS5 version to September 6. According to the most recent community update, the change was done to prioritize release in order of platform readiness. More specifically, the team needed a little more time to get the PS5 version up to 60 frames per second.\n\"The PlayStation 5 version will be released roughly a week later than its originally scheduled date of August 31st,\" the community update reads. \"Baldur’s Gate 3 is targeting 60 frames-per-second and we’re close to achieving that on the platform but need a bit more extra time. We don’t want to compromise on quality, and feel it would be a shame to downscale to 30fps or make other compromises to hit an arbitrary date.\"\nMeanwhile, the PC version has moved up a whopping four weeks. Larian says, \"This means the PC version of Baldur’s Gate 3 will be released at a time where you’ll have more time to play it,\" likely in reference to the release of Starfield, Bethesda's massive upcoming open-world RPG. By releasing their game over a month earlier, it's a little less likely that gamers would have to choose one or the other to devote their time to.\nThe community update also casts a light cantrip on some of the features coming to the full game, including new spells, the addition of feats, the Half-Orc and Dragonborn races, the monk class, and a huge line-up of new subclasses, which you can see listed below.\nFor more Baldur's Gate 3, check out its Summer Game Fest trailer that revealed Jason Issacs' role in the game.",

While it makes the world more believable, it can be incredibly disorienting for an audience to be thrust headfirst into a sea of unfamiliar proper nouns, especially before they have a chance to get to know the world's characters.

Similar to Pokemon Showdown, Temtem Showdown is all about battling. It's also free to everyone. \n\"Temtem Showdown takes the best Temtem competitive action and places it within immediate reach for everyone,\" a press release reads. \"Get to know the colorful critters from the massively multiplayer creature-collection adventure, build your team in seconds, and dash into battle to test it out against other players and their teams – or carefully curate a plan of action to overpower your opponents.\" \nUnlike Temtem, which is a multiplayer Pokemon-like game where you catch and train Temtem to use in 2 vs. 2 battles, Showdown will let players build a team from scratch right from the jump. And then you can hop right into a battle, without needing to worry about their level like you might in the base game. You can play against other players both casually and competitively, and the latter will feature a ranked system and a ladder to climb up as you play. \nCrema says Showdown will receive regular balance patches to keep the meta fair, and new Seasons will bring additional content and changes as well. \nFor more, read our thoughts on the base game in Game Informer's Temtem review.",

Carrying on the Mario momentum, Oreo announced a limited-edition cookie collab with the iconic Nintendo franchise.\nThe cookies feature 16 unique embossments starring characters like Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Goomba, and Bowser Jr., as well as power-ups like Super Stars and Fire Flowers. Packs will be filled at random. Oreo is also holding a social media event where they're asking those who buy the cookies to stack as many of the hero-embossed cookies on the rim of a glass of milk without the cookies falling into the milk and share the video on social media in a concerted effort to save Princess Peach from Bowser's Castle.\n\"We hope to unite cookie lovers and Super Mario enthusiasts alike with this playful mission, inspired by a storyline fans know all too well,\" Oreo senior brand manager Vishnu Nair said in a press release. \"We may even reveal a surprise as a thank you to those who successfully defeat Bowser and save the kingdom... Fans will have to wait and see!\"\nYou can check out a fun musical trailer for the collaboration below.\n\n\nThe Oreo x Super Mario cookies will begin rolling out to retailers nationwide starting July 10, but will only be available for a limited time.

In the first post, we went into a bit into the infrastructure that runs OpenTTD, from BaNaNaS to our main website. In this post, we will explain a bit about the migration we just did to get to this infrastructure. After over 2 months of work, I am happy to announce we finished (another) infrastructure migration. Today is the day I removed the last few DNS entries pointing to AWS’s DNS servers, and I am proud to mention that (almost) all traffic is now routed via Cloudflare (and we aren’t even receiving sponsoring to say so). In this post I want to take you with me why this migration was needed, what the benefits are, and why you possibly care. But in short summary: (Much) smaller monthly bill as AWS charges insane amounts for bandwidth. Faster download speeds for you (ranging from the in-game content service to downloading the game from our website). Easier maintainability of our infrastructure with thanks to Pulumi. This will be a bit nerdy, so if you like these kind of things, continue the read!",
