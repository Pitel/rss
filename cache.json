We're talking practical, preventative health tips borne of life experience; things that could have saved us physical discomfort — if not downright pain — and put our now-30-something bodies in better stead for the decades ahead. Tips like 'invest in an electric screwdriver!', for instance. We ended up assembling an enormous amount of IKEA furniture in the last decade or so and would have saved ourselves a lot of time and hand, wrist, and arm strain by shelling out for a decent 18W Black+Decker years ago.\nOne such piece of advice to save our aching back would be to invest in a decent chair for work and play. Enter Herman Miller and Logitech G with their latest gaming offering, the Vantum. Following on from the Embody — the first collaboration between the companies to offer gamers a premium gaming chair (a $1,695 / £1410 premium, no less) — the Vantum is billed as their \"first-ever performance chair made specifically for gamers\".\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Layers Of Fear — recently quietly renamed from its working title Layers Of Fears — is a game that requires a bit of explanation. It shares its title with the 2016 game of the same name, and is being overseen by original developers Bloober Team. But it's neither a remake nor a reboot; although, in some ways, it's both of those things. It's more a \"reimagining\" of the whole Layers Of Fear series to date, as well as its apparent swansong. It incorporates ground-up remakes of the two-and-a-half existing games in the series in Unreal Engine 5, alongside a new gaiden chapter complementing the first game, and a brand-new framing narrative tying the whole lot together. \nI recently sat in on an early preview presentation of Layers Of Fear, chatting with creative director Damian Kocurek. Listeners to one very specific episode of the EWS podcast might recall that I'm something of a Layers Of Fear lore theorist, so of course I was delighted to nerd out over what this new(ish) game is all about. Similarly detail-oriented horror fans out there will hopefully share my excitement when I tell them that yes, the rats are back, and you can even catch a brief glimpse of the Rat Queen.\nRead more",

          "description": "In the run-up to its original 2005 release, Capcom was refreshingly - and publicly - clear about their intentions for Resident Evil 4. Feeling that the classic top-down formula that had seen the series thrive during the 90s had grown stale, this follow-up was to be a total reinvention of survival horror as a concept. Something fresh. Dynamic. Exciting. The slate was wiped completely clean, and from that blank canvas, something exceptional was created. A game that not only redefined the franchise, but third-person action games as a whole.\nFor eighteen tumultuous years, Capcom has tried to surpass the success of Resident Evil 4. The fifth and sixth entries doubled down on the action to mixed results, while seven and eight focused on scares as seen from a first-person viewpoint. Meanwhile, 2019’s Resident Evil 2 remake looked to the past for its inspiration, delivering a masterful retread that blended responsive third-person combat with the exquisite production values of the series’ more modern titles. But with the release of Resident Evil 4 remake, Resident Evil has finally come full circle. Whereas the original release was a rejection of the games that came before, this remake is instead a celebration of where the series went next. Action-focused combat. Photo-realistic environments. Gooey monsters, hammy characters, ridiculous storylines. What better way to remake the highest peak of the series, than to build it upon the foundations of the very games it went on to inspire? Resident Evil 4 is a rambunctious thrill ride that is as good - if not, dare I say it, a bit better - than the original game.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Dodgy reseller listings aside, the Steam Deck has spent its entire life thus far without even a temporary price drop. That ends today, as the Steam Spring Sale has launched with the first official Steam Deck savings - a 10% cut across the range - alongside the more expected dealsplosion of discounted games.\nWhat’s more, this sale could also be the last time that the Steam Deck joins in a Steam sale, at least for a very long time. Lawrence Yang, a Valve designer who recently spoke to us about the Deck’s first year in the wild, has also told me that the company are \"looking at this as a one-time deal in celebration of Steam Deck's anniversary.\" You’ll therefore have until March 23rd, when the Spring Sale ends, to seize a saving on the handheld PC before it returns to base pricing – maybe for good.\nAll three Steam Deck versions are part of the sale, shedding exactly 10% apiece. The 64GB model is down from £349 / $399 to £314.10 / $359.10, the 256GB model drops from £459 / $529 to £413.10 / $476.10, and the top 512GB model falls from £569 / $649 to £512.10 / $584.10. Unlike the sad old days of 2022, there’s no lengthy waiting period once you put your order in, though I wouldn’t be surprised if it takes the full two weeks of Valve’s one-to-two week delivery estimate, what with the likely surge in demand.\n Read more",

It also works when transferring between a Steam Deck and another Steam Deck, or between two PCs. Valve have a little explainer here, but it’s simple enough that – for example – hitting the Install button for a game on your Steam Deck will automatically detect if your PC is on the same network, and start transferring as much as it can from the desktop instead of downloading the whole thing from scratch.\r\n\n\r\nYou can even opt into sending/receiving game data from PCs and Steam Decks owned by other people, so long as they’re also connected to the same local network. The biggest benefit seemingly comes to those with monthly data caps (morning, Yanks), as these transfers won’t usually involve any extra downloads. Even so, it’s a helpful addition for anyone on all-you-can-eat data as well, since local transfers are much faster than old fashioned installs. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Heed my words, dear reader: Paranormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo is best played if you go in knowing nothing about it. Zilch, zero, nada. Its twists and turns from the get-go have my brain doing mental gymnastics, not just in the game but in trying to figure out how to write around them for this review. I’m not going to spoil everything, but keeping your expectations completley wide open lets Paranormasight snake right on in and surprise you when you least expect it to. \nHere’s a quick elevator pitch: Paranormasight is a Squeenix-developed horror mystery visual novel about deadly rituals, ghost stories, curses, and the occult. Its subversive approach to classic visual novel staples make its puzzles feel smart and its horror scares hit hard. If you’re a fan of the thrills found in the Danganronpa and Zero Escape games, Paranormasight is like a bite-sized version of those two behemoths. It’s short, smart, and will keep you on your toes until the end.\nSo yeah, if that sounds like your thing, then have at it. From here on in, I'm going to be gabbing abut it in-depth.\nRead more",

It is a manual job (slicing up spaceships for salvage) with an extra layer (unionism) to elevate it far beyond what it could have gotten away with. In this way it seems a lot like my beloved PowerWash Simulator (washing things; time travel).\nThe main thrust of the game I can really get behind - peeling apart big metal ships like clanky onions - but the more literal thrust, i.e. the moving around in zero gravity using a jetpack, is awful. I need you to give me a frame of reference for if you all felt this way at the start, because, genuinely, I am so bad at Hardspace: Shipbreaker that it makes me want to cry.\nRead more",

But the power of the internet determines that nothing is sacred, and even the point-and-click Myst can be turned into the point-and-kill Myst FPS. Yes, developers Steven Nass and Peter Henningsen have released Myst FPS on itch.io, a free browser-based shooter that’s a good laugh, and an even better shitpost.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Sure, it's not quite as bad as 'death by exploding sun' in Outer Wilds, say, but when each crash is also accompanied by heroine Junon reliving a harrowing memory from her past that she'll need to sort through and analyse before she's able to (quite literally) move on with her life, I reckon that one-two punch of sudden physical trauma and deep, emotional soul-bearing is probably just about on par with having skin and muscle seared off your own bones by a honking great supernova.

          "description": "To track the public understanding of modern-day indie gaming is to look at the small-scale independent development scene through an Anglo-centric lens. While it would be unfair to ignore the hobbyists programming experiences in BASIC on their ZX Spectrum or similar, it’s commonly accepted that indie gaming as we recognise it today has its roots in the early days of the internet and the Y2K boom, when Flash, Gamemaker Studio and similar tools allowed things like Cave Story and N to grow. With online distribution further helping games like Bastion, Journey and World Of Goo to flourish, the definition of the indie game became: a title with big ambitions and creativity grown from small budgets and teams.\r\n\n\r\nIt's not entirely wrong, but it has obscured decades of hobby development that was once at the forefront - not just the stories of BBC Micro solo-development stars, but similar ones of hobby development from around the world. In Japan, the doujin markets of Comiket and beyond serve as a home for hobbyists to make, sell and share their creations. It is the doujin gaming scene that helped major studios like Fate/ studio Type-Moon, and franchises like 07th Expansion and Touhou Project, flourish in a way that would never be possible otherwise.\r\n\n \nRead more",

They're all full of weird stuff.\nThere's a panic room where a guy turned into a zombie mid-demo tape recording. Actress Emma, who you're battening down the hatches with, has a truly awful full-length Burt Reynoldsian portrait of herself. A shared house called the GOAT PEN, where a team of influencers all live together, has a set for a video series called LIT OR SH!T, and a whiteboard with the script for an apology video. I ask the game director David Stenton if it's low hanging fruit, or if there's no such thing with Hollywood rich people. \"Of course, it's low hanging fruit!\" he says, laughing. \"And also, there's no such thing.\"\nRead more",

But within ten minutes you'll be actively saying things like \"does the empty space over here feel like purity or desolation\" and \"what does the contrasting colour of these triangles say about their relationship with the central star?\".\r\n\nIt's been a while since I played a game about creating art that felt effortless even as I put in a lot of effort.

          "description": "Until recently, the story of Intel’s Arc GPUs has been a litany of mild disappointments. After years of it being easier to buy an original O’Keefe than a reasonably priced graphics card, the Arc series brought hope that it might actually be possible to get a decent PC upgrade for less than £500. Then they were repeatedly delayed, confirmed to possess some unwelcome technical quirks (like wanting Resizable BAR on at all times), and ultimately released with merely decent-ish performance. Nothing awful, but nowhere near as special as they once seemed like they could be.\nIn 2023, however, Intel Arc may be on a redemption... arc. A series of driver updates, Intel claims, have improved average FPS performance by up to 87% since launch, with major gains in frame times (the time between each new rendered frame) as well. The specific model we have here, the Arc A750 Limited Edition, has also had its price cut from £330 / $289 to  £250 / $250. More power for less money? I’d say that’s worth a fresh evaluation.\nRead more",

They all have amnesia, of course, because that’s a low-effort way to generate an air of mystery. Well, except the detective, who is just confused because he never really figured out what was going on in the first place. \nOverall, it’s a thoroughly okay game from 2008 that’s been papered over with some hazy lofi graphics to justify selling it at full price in 2023. It’s up to you if you think that’s worth it – I bought the Mass Effect remaster, so I’m hardly one to judge – but while the graphics have been thoroughly airbrushed, that’s no cure for Fatal Frame’s dated gameplay and undead pacing. \nRead more",

          "description": "I really enjoyed the first Figment when it released back in 2017. An action-platformer with a musical theatre twist using the human mind as its stage? Very creative! Bedtime Studios’ follow-up Figment 2: Creed Valley keeps very close to the beat of the first one. You don’t need to have played Figment 1 to enjoy this sequel, but I almost feel like you’d be missing you if you didn’t (especially as it’s free on Steam right now, for today only).\nFigment 2 has all the visual flair and catchy sing-songs of the first, but it feels weirdly smaller. Both games will run you about 5 hours each, but Figment 2 is a little less punchy, a little less diverse, and feels more like an encore rather than a dazzling comeback album. That’s not necessarily bad; I love an encore, and I enjoyed seeing more of Figment's surreal, subconscious mind-world. But, yeah, it’s very much the same as the first game, but with less scope and fewer fart clouds.\nRead more",

And that's coming from someone who recently reviewed Team Ninja's Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, a game that's mighty good at grinding people into paste. I'm not trying brag; I'm being vulnerable with you. I have a case of the Ben Affleck blues, where most sessions of Clash's third-person action-adventuring have me veering from elation to being slumped against a wall with Affleck's signature grimace on my face.\nAside from being really difficult, I'm a bit undecided on how I feel about Clash in the portions I've played so far. It looks fantastic and puts some brilliant spins on combat, but levelling is a bore and exploration has a confusing edge. It's at once both a grand time and an annoying one. The surreal lands of Zenozoik, it turns out, aren't all sunshine and turkey men. There are a lot of turkey men, though.\nRead more",

          "description": "\"Have a go of Sons Of The Forest,\" my compatriots at RPS told me. \"It's a great new survival game, with cannibals who live on an island!\" And I was like, \"wait, so until you turned up to they just eat each other? How do they have a sustainable population? What's going on here?\"\nThus, in a spirit of pure scientific enquiry, I booted up Sons Of The Forest and immediately discovered that everyone has been lying to me, because Sons Of The Forest is not a survival game. Sons Of The Forest is very clearly an early 00s b-movie action thriller. The script was left in a filing cabinet in Slough in an empty office until the office was repurposed into a call centre, at which point it was found by a middle-manager whose paintball team thought it was awesome, and somehow he sent it to a game developer by mistake. This is what happened, and you cannot convince me otherwise.\nRead more",

          "description": "Wayfinder, an upcoming action RPG with light MMO touches, is being developed by Airship Syndicate, the folks behind Darksiders Genesis and Ruined King: A League Of Legends Story. I've spent some time with the closed beta, poking and prodding at the game's live service cogs to determine whether it's running a smooth operation or a clunky one that may not be worth your time.\nAnd you know what? The game took me by surprise. So far, it's a decent time that's perhaps more along the lines of a Destiny, than say, World Of Warcraft. I genuinely believe it could garner a big community and have a bright future ahead of it - but when it comes to such a saturated space, I worry that Wayfinder may struggle to stand out, and won't attract players who are done with the usual rise 'n grind demands of these sorts of games.\nRead more",

Take-Two later confirmed the news in a statement to PC Gamer, saying the layoffs would affect “corporate operations and label publishing.” Take-Two haven’t clarified the number of employees that have been laid off, but the cuts to development teams would be “minimal.”\r\n\n \nRead more",

Chess Ultra offers a variety of traditional and ornate chess sets and pieces, as well as 10 levels of Grandmaster A.I. and online multiplayer support. Players can choose from a variety of timed modes, or solve a litany of over 80 scenarios — some of which are pulled from the intense climaxes of real-life chess tournaments. Additionally, Chess Ultra supports 4K resolution, as well as VR through Oculus and HTC Vive.\nhttps://youtu.be/FrONtYp6Pic\nAlongside Chess Ultra, the new Epic Games Store update will also offer up free DLC for the long-running strategy title World of Warships. The World of Warships — Starter Pack: Ishizuchi features the titular Tier IV battleship, as well as 11 Epic camouflage patterns, five award containers, and a variety of in-game boosters and currency packs. The DLC usually retails for around $20, so if you're a WoW fan, be sure to jump on this bargain while you are able.\nChess Ultra and WoW: Ishizuchi will be available to download free from Epic Games Store from March 16-23. Until then, you still have time to pick up Warhammer 40,000: Gladius – Relics of War.\nThe post Chess Ultra leads next week’s Epic Game Store freebies appeared first on Destructoid.",

The jaguar-masked wrestler has been a staple of Tekken since the series' beginning, delivering high-flying, devastating destruction. And King is looking absolutely fantastic in the latest Tekken 8 gameplay trailer.\nBandai Namco has been gradually spotlight each Tekken 8 combatant with a gameplay trailer of their own, and King is the newest one in the arena. What more do I need to say? It's King. He's got powerful punches, leaping kicks, and chain combos with grapples that seem like they do some real, real damage. I spied a taunt of some kind as well, with King baring his chest, daring the opponent to take a swing and find out what happens. The result? Not good for them.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OII3DNh4iaE\nThere's something electric about the way King plays that's just fun to watch. I'm normally not a grappler player, but King feels a bit more acrobatic than his throw-happy counterparts in games like Guilty Gear or Street Fighter. In the trailer, we can see the new Paul, with much less hair product than usual, getting absolutely demolished by King's knee. It's fantastic.\nWhether it's talking it up on the mic or delivering devastating destruction, King always brings it. If there's one constant in Tekken, as even characters like Jin start to change and adapt for Story Purposes, I'm glad it's King.\nTekken 8 is currently in development for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. No firm release date or window's been locked in yet.\nThe post King brings the pain in new Tekken 8 gameplay trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Banned from the NBA\nRed Wing Shoes have shown off their pair of replica kicks made in celebration of the upcoming Super Mario Bros. Movie. Unfortunately, they’re not selling them.\nThe company shows the creation process in a video that would be effective ASMR if they didn’t underline it with dramatic music. With painstaking stitching, a bit of hammering, and some good old-fashioned glue, they put a bunch of dead cows together to create the sort of shoes that kids get made fun of for wearing at school. The shoes appear to be officially sanctioned by Nintendo, but if not, this company is very excited about the Super Mario Bros. Movie.\nhttps://youtu.be/YAm8GK47cDw\nOnce again, the caveat here is that you cannot buy these shoes, not in the usual shoe sense where they were all bought up by scalpers and are being resold for a few jillion dollars, but in the literal sense where they’re simply not up for sale. This is possibly because the Mario games have shown that they are deadly weapons capable of crushing anything without a hard shell.\nNot that I would personally want to. They have laces. No one has time for laces. Do kids even know how to tie laces anymore? Kids these days…\nOn the other hand, this is great advertising for Red Wing Shoes.  I had never heard of them, but there are some nice boots here! This may surprise you, but video game people like myself don't have much need for a practical pair of work boots. I do stub my toe sometimes, but not enough that I need some safety-toed boots to wear at my desk.\nThe post Red Wing Shoes made a real pair of Mario clodhoppers, but you can’t have them appeared first on Destructoid.",

While LCD displays have largely led to a major decline in light gun games, House of the Gundead uses a pair of shiny Shinden light guns for allegedly pixel-perfect aiming. It also has some absolutely fab cabinetry, with great artwork and a big, big 43” screen.\nNot only that, but the game itself looks fun. Drawing from the cute, cartoony style of Enter the Gungeon, it’s a far cry from your usual Time Crisis. I’m honestly having difficulty saying more about it because I’m taken in by its visuals.\nI really want to play it. It’s too bad arcades are a myth.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/N1R4eVLxTP4[/embed]\nI’m hoping House of the Gundead gets ported eventually. I recently put money down on a Sinden light gun because if it does what it says on the box – and I have no reason to believe it doesn’t – then it’s an exciting prospect. I’m not a gun person by any means, but I love the physicality of the experience. At least I can afford one of those. I’m not sure where I’d put an arcade cab in my postage-stamp-sized apartment, but if Devolver would like to send me one for review (wink wink), I would be willing to throw my husband out to make space.\nHouse of the Gundead is available for order right now in arcade cabinet format only.\nThe post Can someone lend me $5500 to buy this House of the Gundead arcade cabinet? appeared first on Destructoid.",

The new title will feature all of the typical action players have come to know from the series — from attending school classes and enjoying local activities to battling demons and exploring alternate universes. Both Sega and Atlus' dedicated P-Studio will supervise production.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upvfxp00Bv4&ab_channel=GamersPrey\nTwo new trailers showcase The Phantom X's very nice visuals, and also reintroduce us to The Velvet Room, complete with what appears to be a whole new assistant. I'm certainly not denying that it looks like a legitimate and authentic spin-off of the Persona series' biggest-selling release, (and that new owl companion is super cool) but by its core F2P w/ in-game purchases concept, it's difficult not to view the title immediately with a raised eyebrow and an impending sense of expensive dread. Am I being presumptuous? Perhaps, but then, we've all had more than enough experience with these titles.\nHere's hoping our new Phantom Thieves will buck the trend.\nPersona 5: The Phantom X / Persona: Phantom of the Night is in development for iOS and Android platforms.

Mechanics that were refined in the title, such as the aiming and over-the-shoulder camera, became widespread in the console generation that followed. QTE events caught on in a big way, and set-piece moments became focal points in many big titles. Some of the best and worst parts of modern game design were first popularized in the 2005 title. As meandering and unfocused as it could be, it's an important and well-loved title.\nWhen the Resident Evil 4 remake was announced, like many people, I wondered how Capcom would approach the most over-the-top and ridiculous elements that seem so out-of-place in the drab, monotonous high-budget market.

I know y'all can’t sleep until we report whether the newest 7-Star Raid Pokemon can breed or not, and I’m here to deliver you the good news. Decidueye can, in fact, lay eggs. Here’s what you need to do.\n[caption id=\"attachment_369210\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]\nBring Decidueye and Ditto to a picnic\nJust like with Greninja and Cinderace, you can get a Rowlet egg by bringing Decidueye and Ditto to a picnic. For best results, remove all other Pokemon from your party to ensure Rowlet will appear as an egg. This effectively circumvents the “only one Decidueye can be caught per save file” rule of the 7-Star raid, though baby Rowlet won’t have the Mightiest Mark title. Use this trick to hook your friends up with Decidueye if they miss the event!\nFor more information, check out our guide to find Ditto here. We also have a detailed guide on egg hatching here. If you plan to hatch a lot of eggs, consider getting a Pokemon with the Flame Body ability as well. I've maybe written too much about this video game.\n[caption id=\"attachment_369211\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]\nIn Pokemon Scarlet & Violet, Rowlet still evolves into Dartrix at level 17, and Decidueye at level 34\nAs always, all you need to evolve your Rowlet is good old level grinding. For best results, use your EXP candies on Rowlet to level it up fast. If you’ve run the 7-Star Decidueye Raid, there’s a good chance you have more than a few EXP items to spare.\nThis has been your Tim “The Poké-man” Monbleau PSA of the day.

It's set to be a narrative-driven fantasy epic, with an \"exotic open world\" to explore.\n\"We strive to create a compelling story-focused AAA title that combines and refines the best aspects of gameplay that Techland is known for,\" reads the post.\nhttps://twitter.com/TechlandGames/status/1636378215550976001\nWhat can we see? Well, we've got a man holding onto a tree, observing a far-off city. There's some wildlife about, and some waterfalls, and off in the distance is a big, cracked planet. Not too much to go on for now other than vibes, though vibes seem squarely set in the sci-fi fantasy realm. And given Techland's proclivity for movement in the Dying Light series, probably some free-running at some point.\nSweet, sweet fantasy\nIt's interesting to see Techland turn to fantasy, after doing so much work in the zombie genre. But I do like the idea of some of that parkour-centric development bleeding over into a more out-there world. It reminds me of the new project from IO Interactive, where the team over there is also working on its own fantasy title.\nTechland had teased an open-world fantasy game with RPG elements back in 2016, though it clarified that it has RPG elements, but is not an RPG game.

Collage Mode arrives for PC in a new update today, allowing players to place, pose, and snap pics of their favorite Disco Elysium characters.\nThe new Collage Mode is out now on PC, with console platforms expected to receive the update in the coming days. That includes PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and the Switch version.\nThrough Collage, players can make a scene anywhere around Martinaise. Full access to characters, environments, and effects will be unlocked, creating plenty of potential for what-if meetings or situations.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KsrRLlrBl0\nThere are framings for special looks too, like the Visual Calculus effect. Custom dialogue will also let you essentially create the Disco Elysium fic you've wanted. On top of that, there are \"bonus secrets\" to discover. Apparently, this includes some new work from the Disco Elysium narrator.\nThe Collage Mode update will be free for all players too, so no need to pick up an extra pack of DLC.\nA new cut\nWhen Disco Elysium first launched in 2019, it made a massive impact. As the years have gone on, it's felt like the type of indie hit that sparks wave of discussion and fervor, similar to Hades or Celeste. Its psychologically driven role-playing and openness to failure have stood the test of time, as its Final Cut has made its way to more and more platforms.\nStill, there has also been internal, and eventually external, strife at ZA/UM. The lawsuits finally resolved this week, but it has left a sour footnote.\nFor those who still want to recapture some of that Martinaise magic, Disco Elysium Collage Mode is rolling out on PC now, and will arrive on consoles in the coming days.\nThe post Disco Elysium adds a Collage Mode for making dioramas in Martinaise appeared first on Destructoid.",

The new studio remains busy with its first project, an epic fantasy RPG sporting an original IP. A year ago today, the studio announced that it was partnering with Private Division, which is expected to publish the untitled game once its ready to roll.\n\"The market for independently produced games is growing rapidly and the technology is keeping pace,” said Laidlaw at the time of the studio's founding. “Small, diverse teams can now create high-quality experiences. For veterans of big-studio productions like myself and much of our team, this is the perfect time to get back to a small, agile, and highly motivated group. We want our games here at Yellow Brick to take potentially millions of players on wonderous journeys, and we want every member of our team to have a direct impact on the new worlds we’re creating.”\nThe post Fledgling developer Yellow Brick Games opens second studio in Montreal appeared first on Destructoid.",

The gory multiplayer will test the waters on May 25, with a full release scheduled for August 18, 2023.\nBased on the 1974 horror film, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre looks to pit hapless travelers against the Slaughter family that loves to prey on them. It seems to be following in the same asymmetrical steps of many other multiplayer horror games these days. The victims run and hide, using stealth and wits to survive as the Slaughter Family players hunt them down. And you really don't want to get caught, as you can see in today's release date trailer, via IGN:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mlab3PEYzKE\nJust real gnarly stuff. This does not seem like a multiplayer game for the faint of heart.\nDeep in the heart of Texas\nIf that seems like your type of jam, though, there will be a technical test to kick the tires of this new horror game in May. Gun and Sumo Digital advise those who want to know more about the test to follow The Texas Chain Saw Massacre social channels, or you could keep an eye on the Steam page.\nThe Texas Chain Saw Massacre game interests me, though not solely because of my Texan roots. Many asymmetrical horror games have come and gone, and it feels like the extremely specific adaptations sometimes have trouble sticking around. Going up against established, multi-property juggernauts like Dead By Daylight has to be tough, so I'm curious to see what Sumo Digital brings to the table to make the Slaughter Family's horror experience stand out. You know, aside from the chainsaws.\nThe Texas Chain Saw Massacre hits on August 18 for PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One.

          "description": "Triangles\nDry Cactus has announced that the next installment of the physics-filled bridge builder series, Poly Bridge 3, will be arriving on PC on May 30.\nThe Poly Bridge series represents a surprisingly large and extensive genre of physics games in which you design a bridge. Poly Bridge takes the concept in a more lighthearted direction. Instead of simply experimenting to figure out how a suspension bridge is supposed to function, you complete various tasks that often involve creating whacked-out draw bridges. The series differentiates itself by making things accessible and fun rather than simply challenging.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/bzZBURLA0iE[/embed]\nWith that said, I don’t know how we’ve wound up on a third title. The first Poly Bridge has over 100 campaign missions, and already my bridge-making imagination is stretched beyond its limit. I’m not saying that there is no room for more bridges, I’m just saying I can’t fathom it. Now, Dry Cactus is touting another “over 100” missions in Poly Bridge 3. Just how many gaps need to be bridged?\nThe trailer that has dropped alongside the announcement shows off some of its concepts, including a drawbridge that works via a front-end loader. Some of these various bridges appear to function entirely on magic, and the fact that there is some sort of tangible physics behind them makes me furious. I haven’t even attempted anything, and already, I’m feeling extremely inadequate.\nI guess I can find out if my bridge-building abilities carry any sort of way when Poly Bridge 3 comes to PC, MacOS, and Linux on May 30, 2023. If you’re new to the series, Dry Cactus is also providing a discount on the first two games on Steam.\nThe post Poly Bridge 3 bears the load on May 30 appeared first on Destructoid.",

UEFN is a PC-only editor with a range of tools. Rather than Creative, where you're controlling a character to build and edit islands, UEFN has more similarities with the tools and workflows used to develop Fortnite Battle Royale itself. It's planned to be built out and evolve through its Beta launch.\nThe result could be a fair bit of user-generated content, a la Roblox. Which, given how massive Roblox is, makes sense.

For the purposes of this particular tourney, Shiver will be repping Nessie, Frye will be Team Aliens, while Big Man, as his name would denote, is all about Bigfoot. As per usual, a public vote will be held in Inkopolis, while match points will be tallied from Pro, Open, Tricolor, and Sneak Peek, with the ultimate winner revealed on Sunday, April 2.\nSo, who have you got? I know aliens exist because I've seen Marvin the Martian, and I know Bigfoot exists because he lived with The Hendersons. Additionally, I know that not just one Nessie, but an entire family of Nessies exist.

You do this by building up your deck and strengthening your colony.\n“The goal for us was to allow the player to establish their place in this cursed environment, and make them appreciate how hard they fought and what they stood for. Nothing is ever granted in the Bayou, and thriving against the Baron's evil forces is a real achievement,” said Alexandre Clement, Game Designer at La Grange.

Titled Xevious The Avenger, this vertically scrolling shmup was initially released on the Japanese Famicom in 1984, and was, at the time, one of the very first third-party titles in Nintendo history.

          "description": "Radioactive Ugly\nSurreal, there's almost no other word for it — Studio Retroware has announced that it is producing a side-scrolling beat-'em-up based on short-lived '90s cartoon Toxic Crusaders. The Tromatastic release is expected to ooze on PC and consoles in late-2023, and is already price-tagged at $24.99.\nStill one of the most baffling children's adaptations of all time, Toxic Crusaders is an animated spin-off of the extremely violent and thoroughly bad-taste Toxic Avenger movies — a series launched by Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz' notorious New York studio, Troma Productions. \"Toxie\" is a superhero born after bullied nerd Melvin Junko falls into a barrel of toxic waste, emerging as a physically deformed, eye-gouging, arm-ripping vigilante. The films are notable for their avalanche of sex and violence, featuring scripts that are packed with outrageously offensive characters and jokes.\nAnd thus, in 1991, TMNT producer Fred Wolf picked up the license for a children's TV show.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-tOCfDFxhw\nThe Toxic Crusaders video game will see one-to-four players select from a meaty 'n' mutated roster of seven characters — including Toxie, girlfriend Yvonne, humanoid dog Junkyard, and surfing scientist Headbanger — before heading into the streets of Tromaville to clean out its pollution-lovin' villains. Toxic Crusaders will feature classic arcade brawler action, a newly recorded score, full voice acting, motion-comic cutscenes, and cameos from other denizens of the Troma universe, including Poultrygeist and Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D.\nWhile I'm still kind of reeling from this bizarre news, I have to admit that if the aftermath of TMNT: Shredder's Revenge means we're to be inundated with beat-'em-up love letters to '90s shows, then I'm here for it.\nToxic Crusaders launches late-2023 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.\nThe post Troma’s Toxic Crusaders comin’ back in beat-’em-up form appeared first on Destructoid.",

Today, the studio confirms that Sea of Stars will head to Xbox consoles on August 29, the same day as it arrives for PC, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch.\nThis updated launch platform coverage includes both Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S, so both generations will be able to play the new adventure. There's also a demo out, though it's currently only available on the Nintendo eShop.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3NNRkR1fSw\nSea of Stars sees two protagonists, the Children of the Solstice. With one wielding sun powers and the other moon, they combine to create Eclipse Magic, the only thing capable of stopping The Fleshmancer. It looks quite nostalgic, helped by the fact that Chrono Trigger's Yasunori Mitsuda is a specil guest composer on the soundtrack.\nYou're a sea full of stars\nThis RPG is also the latest project from Sabotage, the studio behind 2018's The Messenger. In that one, the team tackled a different kind of old-school genre in the action-platformer. Here, with Sea of Stars, they take on the classic turn-based RPG.\nI played a little bit of the demo and found it intriguing, though I'm mostly holding off for the full game. I will say, I do really like the look that Sabotage has crafted for Sea of Stars so far. It's a colorful world with some great little details. Now, Xbox players will also be able to see it for themselves at launch alongside other platforms.\nSea of Stars arrives on Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and Switch on August 29, 2023.\nThe post Sea of Stars adds Xbox to its launch day platforms appeared first on Destructoid.",

The game quickly became one of the top-selling games in the history of the popular console, and now, it's time for the new generation to kick off within the popular Pokémon Trading Card Game. The inaugural Pokémon Scarlet & Violet expansion does more than just introduce the ninth generation of Pokémon into the TCG; it also implements a whole host of changes, not the least of which is a higher price tag for most items. \nHowever, along with that price increase come several benefits, including a new guarantee of three foil cards in every booster pack, plus the introduction of the silver border in the U.S. and other quality-of-life improvements with regards to the designs. The Pokémon Company sent over several booster packs for us to crack open and see what we could pull. While I was less frequently blown away by the big cards I pulled, this is one of the most robust galleries of \"the coolest cards\" articles I've done in a great many expansions. Partially, that is due to me enjoying seeing some of the newer Pokémon from Gen IX getting their first cards, but I can't help but think the increase in foil cards was to thank.\nIn total, the Pokémon Scarlet & Violet expansion introduces more than 190 new cards, including more than 10 new Pokémon ex cards, more than 30 Trainer cards, new Tera Pokémon, and tons of special-illustration Pokémon and Trainer cards. You can see the coolest cards we pulled from this expansion in the gallery below:\n\n Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet is available starting on March 31.

In the press release announcing the news, the company only lists Berzerk and Frenzy. Atari simply says it has acquired a \"dozen retro arcade games\" so it's likely the other 10 properties are from the same era of arcade games as Berzerk and Frenzy. \n\"Atari...announced today the acquisition of a dozen retro arcade games, including the '80s classics Berzerk and Frenzy,\" the press release reads. \"Atari will seek to expand digital and physical distribution of the classic titles, create new games based on the IPs, and explore brand and merchandising collaborations.\"\nAtari says Berzerk is \"a top-down, multidirectional shooter designed by Alan McNeil that was released for arcades in 1980.\" It's perhaps best known for being the first arcade video game with speech synthesis. Following its arcade release, Berzerk was ported to the Atari 2600 and Atari 5200 by the console maker. Frenzy is actually a sequel to Berzerk first released in 1982. \n\"Berzerk is one of those foundational games that so many people first encountered playing on an Atari console,\" Atari CEO Wade Rosen writes in the press release. \"Berzerk, and the other titles included in this acquisition, are a perfect fit for our strategy of commercializing classic retro IP.\"\nWho knows if we'll learn what the other 10 retro arcade properties Atari has acquired are – only time will tell.

Now, Valheim is finally available on Xbox, and you can download it via Xbox Game Pass starting today, too. \nThat means you can play Valheim on PC via PC Game Pass, Steam, Microsoft, Humble Stores, and Xbox consoles starting today. Valheim is still coming together in early access on PC, and that remains the case on console as it's part of the equivalent Xbox Game Preview program. The game became really popular in 2021 for its unique setting within the survival genre. And simply put, the game's a great time, too.\nCheck it out in the Xbox release date trailer below: \n\n\nIf you're hopping into Valheim today, be sure to check out our list of the best Valheim mods and then check out this impressive magic mod that brings some Skyrim flavor to the game.

          "description": "Diablo IV, the long-awaited follow-up to 2012's Diablo III, will finally release this June, but it sounds like it won't be launching on Xbox Game Pass. \nThat's because Blizzard's Diablo general manager, Rod Fergusson, recently revealed on Twitter that there are currently \"no plans\" to bring the upcoming game to Game Pass, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Presumably, people have been speculating that the game might come to Game Pass as Blizzard Entertainment and Xbox are close to teaming up by way of Microsoft's pending acquisition of Activision Blizzard. \nIt's awesome seeing the excitement around the Diablo IV Beta, and our Wolf Pack puppy! We’ve been getting some questions about D4 on Game Pass and I want to let you know we have no plans for that. See you in Sanctuary during the Beta Early Access weekend starting on March 17!\nMarch 13, 2023\nAs you can see in Fergusson's tweet above, there's no plans for Diablo IV to come to Game Pass. But Diablo IV is out June 6; perhaps there's time for plans to change (although I'm not betting on it, personally). \nIn the meantime, if you preorder the game, you can hop into a closed beta starting tomorrow, March 17. That closed period runs until March 19 and then starting March 24, there will be an open beta that anyone can jump into. It runs until March 26. \nWhile waiting for these betas, read Game Informer's exclusive guided tour through Diablo IV's Sanctuary. \n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]\nAre you hopping into one of Diablo IV's betas?

The game was first announced in 2019, and developer Red Barrels gave players their first hands-on sample of the game via a closed beta last October. The ETA for the full release remains shrouded in mystery, however. \n\n\nThe Outlast Trials mixes up the formula of the previous entries by letting you play alongside friends in four-player co-op (although you can still play solo). The game unfolds in a secret facility during the Cold War, with players controlling involuntary test subjects being tortured in gruesome experiments. Avoiding enemies instead of confronting them remains the key the survival, though you obtain and upgrade tools that can increase your odds at staying hidden or slowing foes down. \nYou can check out The Outlast Trials in early access on Steam and The Epic Store.",

Capcom has heard those complaints and plans on changing the rain to make it more palatable. \nIn an interview with Press Start Australia (thanks IGN), the outlet asked RE4 producer Hirabayashi Yoshiaki if the team was aware of the negative response to the rain, and he had this to say: \n“We’ve seen everyone’s reaction to the rain effects, and we are working on a day-one patch to make adjustments”\nSo there it is. It looks like “raingate” will soon be a thing of the past, and it’s nice that Capcom recognized the complaints ahead of Resident Evil 4’s release.  \nResident Evil 4 launches on March 24 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC.

You can read more about how to get Discord up and running by visiting the PlayStation Blog. \nAdditionally, the update introduces variable refresh rate support for 1440p, allowing smoother visuals for VRR-compatible HDMI 2.1 displays at 1440p resolution. The game library now filters PSVR and PSVR 2 titles. Data transfer between different PS5 consoles has also been added, and PS4-to-PS5 save data transfer has been significantly streamlined. Be sure to visit the PlayStation Blog for the complete rundown of what the update has to offer. \nWhat do you think of these new updates? Let us know in the comments!",

Additionally, a presentation showcasing more of the game called Starfield Direct will air on June 11. \nIn a new video hosted by game director Todd Howard, he states the Direct in June – which happens to be the weekend before E3 starts – will provide a \"deep dive\" into the game. He reiterates that Starfield is a unique experience that also has many of the hallmarks fans expect from a Bethesda title. We last saw Starfield during the Xbox Game Showcase last summer, where Bethesda revealed its extensive scope, including thousands of planets, spaceship construction, environmental scanning, and other features. \n\n\nStarfield was originally slated to launch on November 11, 2022, before getting delayed. It was later reconfirmed to launch within the first half of 2023, and though September sits on the second half of the calendar, we're happy to see the game get a concrete date again. \nStarfield will be available on Xbox Series X/S and PC and will also launch day one on Xbox Game Pass.",

The main story unfolds across three interconnected campaigns set on land, the sea, and the sky and features a new cast of commanders. It also features a new roguelike campaign called Conquest that tasks players to complete a series of smaller battles while making permanent choices and relying on the same pool of units, health, and resources. \n\n\nWargroove 2 features four-player co-op and versus battles (local and online) along with rule customization and asynchronous play. An in-game editor allows players to create custom maps, campaigns, and even cutscenes to share with other players. \nThe first Wargroove was lauded as a fun throwback to Advance Wars when it launched in 2019, so we’re excited to see what Chucklefish has in store for the follow-up. Wargroove 2 doesn’t have a release window, but it’s slated to launch on Switch and PC. You can read out review of the first game here.",

Until this week, it had never been localized for North America, but starting March 9, it will be available on just about every platform with improved visuals and a new photo mode. Fatal Frame is a game all about fighting ghosts in haunted locations with a magic camera, but this will be the first time you can pause the game and take pictures in the contemporary \"photo mode\" way we are all now familiar with.\nThis episode of New Gameplay Today ended up being a long one, making it feel a bit closer to our Super Replay series where Marcus Stewart and myself have been playing classic horror games like Dino Crisis and Silent Hill. I promise we do encounter some ghosts, though – you just need to be patient.\n\n\nFor more previews and discussions of some of the biggest games of 2023 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania, Final Fantasy XVI, Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon, Atomic Heart, Metroid Prime Remastered, WWE 2K23, SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake, and more.",

Now, the company has announced that The Mageseeker will hit consoles and PC next month. \nMore specifically, The Mageseeker will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on April 18. It will cost $29.99 on digital storefronts, and preorders include the Lost Silverwing in-game bonus. You can also purchase the Digital Deluxe Edition for $39.99, and it includes additional digital items like a Silverwing Supply Station Pack, Home Sweet Home cave decorations, exclusive spells, and Unchained skins. \nCheck out the game in action in the new trailer below: \n\n\n\"Developed by Digital Sun, creators of Moonlighter, the Mageseeker is a gritty 2D hi-bit pixel action RPG, set in Demacia, a mighty kingdom in the world of Runeterra that seeks to curtail what it deems as forbidden magic while wielding magic themselves to maintain order,\" a press release reads. \"Play as Sylas, an escaped mage who joins a band of rebels in the deep forest. Their revolution will shatter Damcai's deceptive peace – a peace built with the blood and sweat of mages. The Mageseeker provides an action-packed fantasy gameplay experience for those looking to experience a story of power, identity, and justice.\" \nRiot Games also revealed today that it is selling a physical Collector's Edition of the game for $169.99. It includes a Sylas statue, an art book, a deluxe art print, the Lux Comic (special edition hardcover), Sylas & Lux enamel pins, and a vinyl soundtrack. All of this comes housed within an exclusive custom box. \n\nThe Mageseeker follows the release of 2021's League of Legends Story game, Ruined King. Check out our thoughts on that in the Game Informer's Ruined King: A League of Legends Story review.

Cristina Scabbia from Lacuna Coil and Will Ramos from Lorna Shore join the cast of recognizable singers to contribute to the soundtrack. Dream of the Beast also adds The Red Right Hand, a new machine gun, and three new outfits, each of which provide unique gameplay modifiers.\nThese updates join the game as part of the Dream of the Beast DLC, but players who don't purchase the premium content also have something to be excited for. The same day the DLC arrives, players can expect a free title update for Metal Hellsinger. This free update adds a new song selection feature.\nBoth of these updates arrive on March 29 on all platforms. The game, which took home Game Informer's \"Best Shooter\" award for 2022, is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.
