It's developed by Sony San Diego of course, so there was a fair amount of novelty when the 2021 entry arrived on Xbox (on Game Pass, no less, as it will be this year as well).\nThat was an entry that arrived a little later than normal, no doubt due to the logistical challenges of work-from-home, etc, in 2020, so it's understandable that a Switch port didn't emerge. We honestly thought the idea would quietly disappear, so were pleasantly surprised when the latest entry was not only confirmed for Switch, but announced as fully-featured and cross-platform. The support is such that Nintendo's hybrid has even been included in the 'Tech Test' week, in which servers are stress-tested and various modes put into effect.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Sail away, sail away, sail away.\nAs game fans, we all believe deeply in going from left to right. If we waste a whole day gaming, and feel like we’ve got nothing done, no one can deny we did at least go from left to right. And if a game’s story is limp and can’t find any import for its platform contrivances, it can at least fall back on the old adage that “it’s the journey (from left to right), not the destination (right)”. Okomotive’s first game was about driving a huge, convoluted truck from left to right. The sheer left-to-right impetus of the whole game was overwhelming. For the follow-up, FAR: Changing Tides, they’ve kept both left and right, but they’ve added down and up, and this will blow your mind.\nFAR: Changing Tides is puzzle-flavoured, low-jeopardy exploration in side-scrolling 2.5D. The world of FAR is desolate and ruined. A civilisation, suddenly gone, leaves wreckage of homely communities and steampunky high technology to be explored by your lonesome protagonist. Extreme weather is pushing you from your home, and others have ventured ahead of you, their outcomes bleak. Whereas in FAR: Lone Sails, you geed a massive car rightwards for a faintly nodded-at reason, in FAR: Changing Tides, you will captain a water vessel instead, for an equally vague purpose. Whether you find that kind of storytelling profound or lazy, the imaginative work of the narrative is going to fall to you. There are, however, enough good sets, props and gloriously apt musical cues that if the story isn’t engaging, it’s probably your fault.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

In my painstaking attempt to do a completely clean, blood-free ghost run in Dishonored 2 all those years ago, I'd sort of forgotten just how powerfully satisfying Arkane Lyon's eye for action really is, and I've been having a lot of fun rediscovering this as I beast my way around Blackreef's four main locations. \nAs you'd expect from an Arkane game, each one of these maps is absolutely huge, full of nooks and crannies and secret passageways just itching to be exploited as you try and take down all of its slightly mad Eternalist cult leaders in a single cycle.

It does not sit you down and explain itself, and I actually kind of like that about it.\nYou're part of, or possibly all of, a kind of 19th century X Files, except instead of talking and analysing the situation, you already know that the way to deal with undead weirdness is to roll up with your revolver and kick its face in.

Core Design managed the same thing with the original Tomb Raider back in 1996, too. Nobody really talks about it now, while the Mario story endures. Possibly because Nintendo didn’t make umpteen identikit sequels over the following decade or splash Mario’s stretchy mug on the cover of The Face. \nReally though, the Italian plumber and English graverobber were equally confident that if all their moves were available right from the start with no unlocking needed then that was enough. Both games were – are still, after a quarter of a century – the Platonic ideal of their characters. And they had bloody good swimming sections. \nRead more",

Since last year's total physics overhaul, you no longer bail with every failed trick, instead teleporting off your board in a strange, stiff way that saves time but (for me at least) replaces one unrealistic motion with another, less funny one. I want to get that gripe out of the way, because otherwise it's still gunning to be the sim for darksliding anoraks. \nThe next update will add two new areas, which I got to try out recently, and some new pro skater faces. If you can ignore the frequent wacky physics hiccups and the rigid, nonplussed reaction your character has when they should, by all rights, be landing flat on their face, you'll find a surprisingly chill skating game. It's less about hoarding points with as many tricks as possible and more about pushing languidly around a city as viewed through a seasoned kickflipper's fisheye goggles. \nRead more",

          "description": "Baldur’s Gate’s most famous barbarian wasn’t actually a barbarian at all. Technically speaking, Minsc was a ranger - a man of the woods who just happened to spin into a rage during battle, hitting friend or foe for extra damage, while ignoring blows that would fell a tree. It was a classification that came with its benefits: since every ranger was entitled to an animal companion, Minsc had justification for his connection to Boo, the “miniature giant space hamster” that lived in his inventory. But the primary reason for the misnomer was a gap in the rules of Dungeons & Dragons.\r\n\n\r\n“Second edition didn’t have the barbarian class,” remembers lead designer James Ohlen. “Baldur’s Gate 2 used third edition classes, but by then, it was too late.”\r\n\n\r\nLarian Studios, the current custodians of the series, don’t have any such issues. Working with D&D’s fifth edition, which has full and flavoursome rules that allow players to embody barbarians, the developers have adapted the class for use in Baldur’s Gate III. It’s a typically meticulous transposition that holds true to the tabletop game’s definition of what makes a barbarian boil: “More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.”\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "A couple of weeks back, I interviewed the creator of Left 4 Dead and general PC gaming multiplayer grandee Mike Booth about his VR tabletop game Demeo. In virtual reality, Demeo seeks to recreate the feeling of playing a TRPG strategy game, huddled around a table with three pals and a load of cheesey crisps. Soon, though, you won't need a headset to play it, as Demeo is also getting a standalone PC version. I got invited for a little hands-on of the PC build, and thought that since I am a tabletop-game-playing person, it'd be interesting to bring Ed along with me. Ed likes multiplayer PC games more than me, but in the kind of kill-streak, headshot, battle-royale way. Thus, as a team, we are perfectly poised to assess how Demeo stacks up as a co-op PC game.\nWe played a single level in Demeo's first adventure module, The Black Sarcophagus, although when it launches in early access a complete game will stretch to three. Demeo will also have all the other adventures released for the VR version, including the most recent forest-set Roots Of Evil, but The Black Sarcophagus placed us in a creepy stone dungeon and/or crypt. The goal was to find the monster carrying the crypt key, remove the key by force, and then unlock door to the next level. Our team of four was completed by Tommy Palm, CEO and founder of Resolution games (and owner of a truly top-tier cardigan) and producer Gustav Stenmark (no cardigan visible sadly, but he seemed cool). Here's how we got on.\nRead more",

It’s a genuinely epic construction; a proper Pillars-Of-The Earth-level feat of game development. And here’s where the future sticks the boot in.

The free-to-play action-RPG hit 1.32 million peak concurrent players on Saturday, narrowly pushing it past the all-time peaks of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Dota 2. Well, 1.32m were in-game, but they might not have been playing. Server problems continued after launch with long queues for some. Publishers Amazon say they're working on it, including planning to create a whole new extra European server region.\nRead more",

While it’s the default rendering option in the western version that launched last week, the original South Korean version went years with just DirectX 9 to its name, and the press build that I used for performance testing (and Ed is using for his review-in progress) remains locked to DX9. Despite the fact that, as I’ve confirmed from testing the release build as well, DX11 provides a tidy performance gain over its predecessor.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Yeah\", with that final \"yeah\" escaping from my lips like a wisp of steam from a kettle.\nThe game boiled me alive, but its open world accommodated these feverish outbursts far better than previous Souls games. There were vast swathes of map to help bring my temperature back down from simmer to sparkling. One thing troubled me, though, and that was the rate at which I'd zip between bosses in-between distractions.

Do a good job and you'll make enough money to scale up alongside the village/town/city.

Lost Ark does provide what is the crudest part of the appeal of something like Diablo - i.e. a thousand chittering enemies flying at you at once as you vaporise them with minimal clicking - but I wouldn't say it's a lovingly crafted version of it. Like the difference between the Wicked Witch in Snow White and a Halloween costume in a plastic bag labelled Legally Distinct Evil Magic Stepmother. But there are also things I appreciate about Lost Ark in general, and its version of [flaps hands] whatever this is.\nIn the spirit of Lost Ark's slightly older (one might even say dated?) sensibilities, I'm going to break it down like I'm reviewing the game in a 90s game mag, separating the game into its constituent parts - just as one can remove the egg from a cake after baking it. Although I should make it clear I'm not doing our proper Lost Ark review. That honour falls to Ed, who is more plugged in to modern MMORPGs than I am. I'm just here to talk about how Lost Ark does and does not compare to Diablo - specifically Diablo II, because that's the best one.\nRead more",

It’s as if bass were a grounded concept you’d momentarily left behind - an earthy comfort for mortals. Then the tumble begins, and you’d better have already picked out a nice, safe spot to land. This is the irresistible dichotomy of the parkour game, as first defined by Mirror’s Edge in 2008 - an invitation to soar, with the understanding that true freedom doesn’t come for free. Height is earned, momentum is managed, and mistakes are punished with a 30 foot plunge.\nPerhaps you’ve seen footage of Dying Light 2’s rooftop running and wondered, “How much of that is me?” In a medium where climbing systems are typically automated rather than simulated, and first-person control tends to end at the waist, it’s natural to suspect that what you’re seeing is a fancy set of animations, triggered by pointing your character in a given direction and holding down the parkour key. I’m here to tell you that Dying Light 2 is not that game: it’s the real deal. It is, among many other things, Mirror’s Edge.\nRead more",

Can a MacGuffin be intangible? No, probably not.\nWe discuss whether any MacGuffin is improved by replacing it with an egg (yes), why a lot of games have souls as MacGuffins, and what our own personal MacGuffins would be. Plus! Impressions of Henry \"Vitamin H\" Cavill, and sensational new character Sir Terence Plunder. Will Sir T become a podcast regular? Only time will tell.

And now it can, for Dying Light 2’s 1.04 update is live, and sharpens Nvidia’s upscaling tech to close that gap between the rendering and native resolutions. \r\n\n \nRead more",

You haven’t admired his gumption as he bounces atop each polar bear head, or upon the still bouncier belly of every (unwilling) crab. \r\n\n\r\nBy the end of my seven hours with Grapple Dog, I wanted to strangle the bastard with his own goddamn hook.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Lost Ark is a new free-to-play MMORPG that is notable because a) it is a hack 'n' slash grind that makes it a bit like a free version of Diablo, b) I have no idea what is happening at any given point in time while playing it, instead drowning in a soup made of words like 'destiny', and c) the player characters look like they work at a sex dungeon. Specifically work at, rather than participate in. They serve drinks and clean wipe-down sofas for minimum wage, and they don't particularly want to be wearing a latex catsuit, but here we are. \nFor example, I'm pretty sure my gunslinger character works at a steampunk cowboy themed erotique parlour. I actually quite enjoy her attack style, a sort of hyper-aggressive DPS that allows her to switch between three different gun stances (pistols, shotgun and rifle). The dual pistols in particular come with a load of crowd-control AOE attacks like explosions and spinning  bullets firing smaller bullets, or something. And while there is some kind of story involving demons and a war and bits of stone (something something destiny), my gunslinger's quest is, currently, the single-minded pursuit of a pair of trousers.\nRead more",

          "description": "\"When will esports be part of the Olympics?\" is a question often asked by people desperate for approval from cultural authorities or from their parents. But some sporting events are in turn eager to piggyback the youth appeal of esports, which is why the 2022 Commonwealth Games will be accompanied by a pilot esports competition. The organisers today announced the Commonwealth Esports Championships, running in August alongside the main event. And maybe it'll lead to more esports?\nRead more",

Every wrestling fan knows that the quality of the roster makes or breaks any wrestling game but that's become especially crucial for 2K22. The game arrives in the wake of a pandemic era that saw over 100 wrestlers fired by WWE, leaving fans worried and skeptical about who's left to plug up the holes. \nUsing 2K’s official roster list, as well as combing through trailers and marketing materials, we’ve put together a list of over 70 confirmed superstars for WWE 2K22. It’s worth noting that 2K’s own roster lacks names that have appeared in trailers while other faces have been confirmed via their character portraits instead of an in-game model. We're also sure you can use this list to connect the dots on who will appear (such as missing tag team partners) that have not been formally announced. We’ll update this list as new wrestlers make the cut. \nHere is the confirmed roster so far with the most recent additions in bold. \nAJ Styles\nAkira Tozawa\nAngel Garza\nBret Hart\nCandice LaRae\nCedric Alexander\nDakota Kai\nFabian Aichner\nFarooq\nJerry Lawler\nJim Neidhart\nJordan Devlin\nKane\nLiv Morgan\nMace\nMarcel Barthel\nMaryse\nNatalya\nOtis\nPapa Shango\nR-Truth\nRaul Mendoza\nSami Zayn\nSantos Escobar\nSonya Deville\nStephanie McMahon\nT-Bar\nTed Dibiase\nTrent Seven\nTrish Stratus\nVince McMahon\nNote: Jeff Hardy and Samoa Joe were previously confirmed, but given both have since been released from WWE, there's a good chance they’re no longer in the game.\nWWE 2K22 launches March 11 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

Goggins film credits include The Hateful Eight, Ant-Man and the Wasp, and the most recent Tomb Raider film. His role in Fallout series is unknown, but Deadline reports that he’s rumored to portray a Ghoul, a human mutated by radiation in the Fallout universe. \nThe Fallout show, which still has no official title, was first announced in 2020. Besides sharing the same general premise as the games, plot details are practically non-existent but the series is helmed by Amazon Studios and Kilter Films, with Bethesda involved as well. Westworld co-creator Jonathan Nolan (brother of Christopher Nolan) will direct the premiere episode and serves as executive producer. Nolan’s Westworld partner Lisa Joy is also involved along with Geneva Robertson-Dworet (Captain Marvel) and Graham Wagner (Silicon Valley) serving as showrunners. The show is currently in pre-production and has no premiere date. \nIf you're looking for more video game series to look forward to, here's a list of upcoming animated adaptations. On the live-action end of things, Paramount+ is getting a spin-off show based on the Sonic the Hedgehog films, and HBO's The Last of Us apparently won't be premiering until next year. There's also a little-known series called Halo debuting next month. \n[Source: Deadline]",

A brief cinematic teaser trailer of Ryu and Street Fighter V upstart Luke is all we have to go on for now in terms of details, but that doesn’t mean we can’t speculate on what we want/expect from the title. So World Warriors, what do you want from Street Fighter 6?\nAs a Street Fighter fan who grew up loving SF II, was less hot on III, got back on the wagon with IV, and completely skipped V, I’m a bit out of the loop, so I'm not entirely sure myself. I'm confident the gameplay itself will be fine, but the reason I never got around to playing the fifth game was due to its infamously botched launch. SFV released missing desired features (like an arcade/story mode) for so long that I stopped caring and had occupied myself with other fighting games by the time they arrived. So I suppose my number one request for Street Fighter 6 is not to do that again. \nI’d also like to see a completely new art direction. Although I loved SF IV’s aesthetic, which was carried over to a lesser extent in V, I believe it's run its course. A new look would really freshen things up and make it feel like a true sequel. The reveal trailer looked mostly unlike the past two entries, though that could just be for the cinematic. We’ll have to wait for gameplay footage/screenshots to see how Street Fighter 6 truly appears. Oh, and make the game multiplatform this time around with cross-play and all that good stuff. \nNow that my boring requests are out of the way, it’s your turn: what do you want to see in Street Fighter 6?",

Last week, we kicked things off with Drake's Fortune, and now we move on to Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, the superb sequel that catapulted the franchise into the stratosphere.  \nUncharted 2: Among Thieves launched October 13, 2009, just shy of two years after Drake's Fortune. Now that it had a solid foundation to work with, Naughty Dog set out to create the video game equivalent of a summer blockbuster film. That included eschewing cutscene setpieces in favor of technically impressive gameplay moments that still offered control over the action, such as the game's famous train sequence. The writing and characters shone even brighter, from Nate himself to newcomer Chloe Frazer to everyone's favorite girl next door, Elena Fischer. Uncharted 2 also introduced a surprisingly solid multiplayer mode, rounding out a stellar package that went on to win numerous Game of the Year awards (ours included). \nJoin hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and IGN Senior Editor Jonathon Dornbush (@jmdornbush) as we unpack the development history and impact of Nathan Drake's magnum opus. \nIf you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

I want to see Marcus be a badass Jedi.\" I hear you, and I'd like to see that as well. We're giving the Replay crew the day off to enjoy the long holiday weekend, and they'll be back to their usual antics next Friday.\nHorizon Forbidden West is the newest game from PlayStation powerhouse studio Guerrilla Games, and the second entry in the Horizon franchise. Set in the distant future where civilization as we know it has crumbled and mechanical beasts roam the land, Horizon follows the adventures of Aloy, who was once a societal outcast, that has become a hero to many of the villages and tribes she meets in Zero Dawn. Forbidden West brings Aloy, well, further west to discover a way to stop a blight that's killing the land and, in turn, what remains of humanity. Check out cool robotic creatures and the beautiful open-world vistas that await Aloy on the stream this afternoon.",

We got a good one for you today with Alex Stadnik on the sticks, Ben Reeves chiming in with his experience with the game and his usual brand of street comedy, and Kim \"KStar\" Wallace giving her impressions as we progress through the opening two hours. Ms. Wallace did the official Game Informer review, and in it, she says: \n\"Horizon Forbidden West reaches a new high bar for Guerrilla Games. It does more than surpass its predecessor; it takes Horizon's fiction to captivating places and builds a rich world that rewards you for the effort you put into it. Mostly, it's an entertaining experience, complete with jaw-dropping moments and unforgettable fights.\"\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the Horizon series, the game's star Aloy, a hero born to save a mechanical world from the sins of the past. Our protagonist has delved deep into this world's history to learn of her connections to the woman who kept life going at a great cost thousands of years ago and how that connection makes her the only person on Earth who can prevent a new mechanical apocalypse. Forbidden West continues that tale with a cast of new and familiar faces, a vastly improved combat and movement system, and some of the best graphics we've seen on the PlayStation 5!\nCan't get enough Horizon ahead of the game's official release? We've got you covered with the video version of Kim's excellent review, a whole cover hub featuring stories on developer Guerrilla Games' newest experience, and an in-depth conversation about the game on the latest episode of The GI Show!",

          "description": "Anime streaming app Crunchyroll has launched on Switch today. \nThat's noteworthy for two reasons. One, it adds another streaming service to Switch, a platform with minimal options for watching TV and movies. Switch owners still only have Hulu, YouTube, Funimation, and Pokémon TV to turn to. There’s also Twitch if you prefer watching streamers. Two, it comes after Sony’s billion-dollar acquisition of the service in December 2020, showing that the company has no intention to prevent Crunchyroll from further spreading its wings to other platforms. \nCrunchyroll on Switch, which is powered by Unreal Engine, is the first video app on the console to offer offline viewing. That means you won’t need an internet connection to catch up on Demon Slayer should you decide to fire up the app at the park or on a car ride. Crunchyroll is a subscription service boasting one of the largest anime libraries, even letting fans stream shows the same day they premiere in Japan. \nWhile a nice addition, the Switch still lacks streaming heavyweights like Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, and others which has been frustrating for owners who want to take advantage of its portability to watch their favorite shows anywhere. If you’re not into anime, that leaves Hulu as the only real option. Hopefully, that changes, but given that the Switch has gone five years without even Netflix, it's probably best not to get your hopes up.",

According to Vincke, the team needs another year of development, but this year will be the last full year required for work on the game. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n“We’re going to release it when it’s ready,” Vincke said. “I mean, the main goal here is quality: getting the game at the quality level that it needs to be. That said, we do think we still need a year to do that. But it will be the last year. We’re getting to the end of it.”\nWhen asked about the launch, Vincke told PCGamesN that it’s “probably not this year, but it’s not going to be much later than that.” It sounds like 2022 is off the table, but 2023 is a sure bet. Of course, anything could happen between now and then that could push back release expectations, but it sounds like if things go according to plan, we’ll all be playing the final version of Baldur’s Gate 3 next year. \nIn the meantime, read about this Baldur’s Gate 3 update that includes new “game-changing” mechanics, fine-tuned roleplaying, and more, and then check out the Druid class recently added alongside a loaded dice option, better cinematics, and multiplayer functionality.

In an interview with Deadline, HBO and HBO Max chief content officer Casey Bloys revealed the show is set to debut as early as next year.\n“It’s not going to air in 2022 — they are still shooting in Canada. I imagine you will see it in ’23,” said Bloys to Deadline. \"Craig [Mazin] did Chernobyl for us, he is a fantastic writer and director. What I’ve seen looks amazing, so I’m excited for it, but it will not be in ’22.\" While it's unfortunate that we won't see The Last of Us adapted this year, it sounds like everything is very much still in production and on track to be completed by sometime in 2023.\nAnother interesting quote from the interview came from Deadline asking whether The Last of Us was seen internally as the next Game of Thrones. To which Bloys replied, \"There is no next Game of Thrones. I’ve been here long enough that I’ve been through, what’s the next Sopranos, what’s next Game of Thrones, now what’s next Succession. There is no next Game of Thrones.” \nThe Last of Us follows Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) as they try to survive in a post-apocalyptic world. Not only are the horrific zombie-like Infected an ever-present threat, but so too are other remaining humans scratching and clawing to stay alive or stay in power. The duo must traverse the United States to deliver Ellie to a promised destination. Other cast members include Anna Torv as Tess, Nick Offerman as Bill, Murray Bartlett as Frank, Gabriel Luna as Tommy, and Merle Dandridge as Marlene.",

Stranger of Paradise boasts 27 jobs and three of them are brand new to the series. The PlayStation Blog provides a rundown of what some of these jobs entail, including the ones exclusive to the title.\nThe jobs unique to Stranger of Paradise are Breaker, Void Knight, and Tyrant.  \nBreaker lets players wield the legendary sword Zantetsuken (famously wielded by classic FF summon Odin) to smash through defenses and potentially land one-hit kills. Square describes this as a trickier playstyle to master but one that can have big payoffs.\nVoid Knight allows you to counter enemy magic attacks, either by absorbing and converting them to MP or turning back against their casters.  \nTyrant buffs your normal attacks with elemental attributes to devastate enemies vulnerable to a particular element. \nOther classes revealed so far include Swordsman (which protagonist Jack begins as), Dark Knight, Black Mage, Sage, Ninja, Paladin, and Thief. At their core, these jobs function the way old-school fans would assume but expect a more action-oriented slant.
