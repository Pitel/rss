Analogue has its own hard-shell plastic case, but WaterField Designs now has three different choices on offer: the Pack, the Pouch and – more recently – the CitySlicker, an Analogue Pocket-sized take on one of its most popular products.\nLike previous versions of the CitySlicker design, one of the big selling points of this case is the leather flap which is secured via a hidden magnet on the front. This makes opening and closing the case effortless, but it does also mean that it's easier for potential thieves to gain access to the Analogue Pocket when you're not paying full attention. Still, the CitySlicker is designed to sit across your body, so you should be able to spot if any unwelcome hands make a grab for your precious FPGA-powered investment. As you can see from the images on this page, the sample we were sent has the white/black leather flap, but other colour options are available.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird’s initially dark comic creations — later given a kid-friendly refashioning — spearheaded Turtlemania: a toxic-waste fusion of martial arts and mutant teen reptiles that swept the globe. Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello, their names cribbed from history’s most fabled Renaissance artists, characterised shirts, shorts, lunch boxes, and of course, video games.\nKonami’s 1989 arcade release, a four-player scrolling beat-em-up engineered to bankrupt unwitting parents, was a dream come true for kids tall enough to reach its bulky, shelf-like control panel. It was hardly the fairest of games, but its sound effects, introduction sequence, and “Cowa-Cowa-Cowabunga!” coin-drop jingle have since matured into giddy nostalgia.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It ticks the critical boxes: open-ended, low-pressure gameplay; wistful ambient music; and graphics in colours muted enough and pixels chunky enough not to overcommit to anything. This sort of thing can be a bit meandering, but Noio has installed some clever guide rails around its post-apocalyptic playground to keep it moving along at just the pace you want.\nFirst, the main game comprises compact dioramas presented in sequence, each needing to be completed to move to the next. This keeps things tight, with no sprawling convolutions to get your head around. Second, the items you can place and seeds you can plant in these scenes are labelled and categorised and stored in your catalogue for future use. This is not a collectathon or compare-the-stats scenario – things just get collected as you encounter them, giving a suggestion of progress.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

As per Valve’s changelog for the Proton 7.0-3 update, V Rising is among several games (including Age of Chivalry and the original Vermintide) to gain sufficient compatibility with the Steam Deck for the second-highest rating of their review programme, just short of Verified.\r\n\n\r\nTechnically, V Rising has been lowercase P-playable on the Steam Deck since late May, when these software improvements appeared on the ‘Bleeding Edge’ branch of Proton Experimental. Now, though, the update has graduated to the main, stable Proton branch, so you don’t have to risk the potential wonkiness of a work-in-progress. I’ve given V Rising a try on the Steam Deck and it does indeed work, though it’s quick to show why it only got Playable status and not Verified.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's all about ecology and being one with nature. This does, at times, feel slightly at odds with the other eye-catching thing about Lightyear Frontier, which is a bloody massive tractor mech stomping about everywhere. \nRead more",

He’s one of the more memorable characters you meet in Tendershoot’s alternate reality web simulator, an angsty teenage boy whose home page is slathered in camouflage textures and GIFS of exploding handguns. Since release, Zane has become one of Hypnospace’s de facto mascots, a beloved dweeb that is abrasive but also kind of painfully relatable? It’s hard to laugh at Zane’s baggy trousers and love for Linkin Park-esque rap-metal when you grew up in the mid-2000’s. I mean, we all bought a dog lead from Wilkinson’s and hooked it between the belt loops on our jeans at one point, right? …right?\n\n\nAhem. Anyway. Announced earlier this year alongside Dreamsettler (a proper sequel to Hypnospace), Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer is an FPS spin-off that stars the fan-favourite teen. Slayers X is framed as being an in-universe project that Zane worked on as a teen, and has been uncovered by his now 37-year-old self, who is determined to finally see it released. There’s a short demo available as part of Steam’s most recent Next Fest, and I’m delighted to say it’s exactly what I hoped it would be.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Like in Vampire Survivors, I think the roguelikelike arcade shooter's real victory condition is spewing so many bullets and explosions and fireballs and lightning strikes and ice shards that the framerate starts chugging. As far as I'm concerned, when the game can no longer process just how ridiculous my run is, I've beaten it and I win. Reader dear, I'm delighted to say I finally managed that in 20 Minutes Till Dawn.

In an attempt to understand the origin of her mysterious \"powers\", Rose will enter the consciousness of the twisted mould that was the source of all the bother in both Biohazard and Village.

It is running combat tests with humans by, er, opening huge wormholes in the sky and dumping hundreds of dinosaurs on us like so many plastic toys.\nIf this concept sounds as incredible to you as it does to many of us in the RPS treehouse, then you can sign up for an upcoming closed network test here.

So everyone was pretty excited to see what this new space RPG holds at the Xbox & Bethesda Showcase stream this weekend. And, sure enough, we actually got a pretty big eyeful of it.\nNow, keep in mind that this game is set in outer space, the vast expanse and wonders of which we cannot ken. You could do any cool, awe-inspiring thing you want with space. Crystal waterfalls that flow backwards into the sky. Aurora borealis-like lights but so low down they whip along at ground level. Deserts of hot-pink dust sprouting deep blue rock spires. Destiny 2 has some cool planets, for example. Imagine my confusion, then, when the footage of Bethesda's brand new IP made it look like they've accidentally done Fallout or Elder Scrolls again.\nRead more",

Balancing the political needs of your state against diplomacy, economy and, you know, war, will take a lot of wrangling of lists, menus and percentages, which you can see in the new gameplay trailer debuted at the PC Gaming Show.\nRead more",

          "description": "If there's anything I've learned from today's Future Of Play event, it's that stylish futuristic dystopian mysteries are where it's at right now in the indie scene, and I for one am all in favour. One of the coolest announcements at the event was Hill Agency: PURITYdecay, described as an \"Indigenous cybernoir detective game\" and in the works at Achimostawinan Games. Although maybe \"in the works\" isn't quite an accurate description, because the game is in fact out very soon: on August 31st this year, to be exact.\nThe trailer is a pitch-perfect hearkening back to the golden age hardboiled detective stories of the 1940s — complete with a black-and-white palette with just the occasional hint of colour to highlight the high-tech parts. High-tech because, despite its 20th century influences, this game is set quite far in the future, in 2262. It's not exactly a nice vision of the world in 240 years' time, though, as the narrator is quick to point out that it's riddled with \"crime, conflict, and propaganda\". Truly holding up a mirror to our times, then.\nRead more",

Imagine something halfway between Observer and Detention, then, and you'll be on the right lines.\nThe trailer harks back to the point-and-click mysteries beloved of my misspent youth, which really fits in with Psychroma's whole retro futuristic vibe. It's got that clever pixel art style that looks exactly how you remember golden age adventure games looking in the '90s, which of course means that it's much, much more polished and modern than those games ever were.\nRead more",

          "description": "\"My Friends Are My Power!\"\nWhen Tetsuya Nomura retires, he'll have one hell of a career to look back on. Not all of it landed for everyone, but his work has had a major impact on so many people: notably, his stewardship of the Kingdom Hearts franchise. Nomura opened up about several facets of the Kingdom Hearts series in an interview with Game Informer: and shared an interesting behind the scenes tidbit about Sora in Smash Ultimate.\nWe already learned that Sora ended up in the game due to a \"chance meeting\" with a Disney rep, but now Nomura confirms that he was actually more \"picky\" than Disney was in regards to his appearance. Nomura notes that he was \"obviously happy\" that Disney would acquiesce and allow the character to appear, and \"[couldn't] believe that Disney okayed him to be in [the] game.\" But once the deal was ready to go, Nomura admits that while Disney was gung-ho, he was the one who had reservations.\nNomura was concerned about his ability to pull it off, \"because it might clash with he established lore in Kingdom Hearts and Disney worlds,\" (it's wacky enough, no worries there!) and had to \"consider [it] very carefully.\" But he doesn't regret it one bit, seeing the positive reaction overall to what ended up being the final [for now] Kingdom Hearts DLC character.\nSora definitely made a splash, and it's safe to say that he and the Smash team made the right choice. It's also cute to see Nomura so humbled by the crossover. Through thick and thin, and all the ups and downs the series has had, it's clear he still cares about it.\nThe post Nomura had more reservations about Sora in Smash than Disney appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Make good choices at Digimon camp\nThe long-awaited Digimon Survive got a new trailer today, highlighting both its tactics and its story ahead of its July 29 launch. There are dangers, decisions, and a whole lot of Digivolution.\nDigimon Survive is one-part visual novel mystery adventure, following a character lost in the world of Digimon. These sections seem to follow the cast of humans as they venture around, trying to figure out what's happened and how to get back home.\nThen, once a battle breaks out, it gets tactical. Digimon battles happen on a grid system with turn-based tactical fights. And yes, the Digimon can evolve into wild, wacky new Digimon.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLiTAk9TyUk\nThe mix of mystery and tactics certainly seems interesting. And I can't help but be drawn in when the trailer shows a chart of Digivolutions with all kinds of crossing arrows and paths.\n\nDigimon are the champions\nThe tactical story-driven Digimon Survive has been in the works for quite a long time, with quite a few delays. Then, earlier this year, the team finally locked a firm date for it on July 29.\nWith such a long road to launch, I'd hope Digimon fans find what they're looking for in Survive. Other Digimon games like Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth have flown under the radar, but been pretty solid.\nThe tactical take and incorporation of adventure game elements in Survive really intrigues me, even as someone who isn't the biggest Digimon fan. (I did really like Our War Game, though.)\nHopefully the wait's been worth it. Digimon Survive will launch on July 29 for PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam.\nThe post Digimon Survive shows off its choices and tactics ahead of July launch appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Last Stardriver\nSony Interactive Entertainment's premier driving simulator, Gran Turismo, is getting ready to burn rubber on the big screen. According to a new report from the Tinseltown insiders over at Deadline, Columbia Pictures is scoping a summer 2023 release date for the fast and furious movie adaptation.\nDirected by Neil Blomkamp, (the big chair behind the great District 9 and the abominable CHAPPiE), Gran Turismo has something of a strange plot concept. Reportedly, the movie will follow the exploit of the world's greatest Gran Turismo player, who transitions their digital racing skills onto the real-world professional car racing circuit. Think The Last Starfighter, but without the world-saving angle.\nAs cheesy as that premise sounds, it is, surprisingly, an adaptation of a true story. British racing driver Jann Mardenborough legitimately won a Nissan-sponsored GT Academy contest in 2011, securing themselves a scholarship in the Nissan’s Driver Development Programme. Since the competition, Mardenborough has gone on to compete in numerous major race tournaments including Japan's GT Super series and the famous 24-hour Le Mans rally.\nPersonally, I prefer my driving movies to focus on people in pleather flame trousers stealing DVD players, but each to their own. Gran Turismo is the latest in a series of film and TV adaptations based on PlayStation properties. Live-action takes on The Last of Us, God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Twisted Metal are already in the works, while the Tom Holland vehicle Uncharted launched earlier in 2022.\nGran Turismo is tentatively scheduled to arrive in theaters August 11, 2023.\nThe post Gran Turismo movie adaptation coming August 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

You can check Sakura out in the video below and download her files from Nexus Mods.\nhttps://twitter.com/DragonifyDev/status/1536427077364244480?s=20&t=cjF114DTGAA9hNq_3mRxJA\nIn recent years, multiple new characters have been added to the UMvC3 roster via mods. Sharp eyes will spot SFV's Rashid also putting in an appearance in this video, while Dragon Ball Z's Goku, Marvel meme Morbius, and even *checks notes* Smol Ame have also been made available to the popular fighter's PC community. Given that UMVC3 is now a creaky 11 years old, it's a testament to the Marvel vs. Capcom community, internationally renowned for its passion and dedication toward the crossover fighting franchise.\nSakura Kasugano is yet to be revealed for the roster of Street Fighter 6, but it's good to know that the fight-loving teen is still keeping her fists and feet flying after-hours.\nThe post Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 mod sees Street Fighter’s Sakura join the party appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It ends on June 30\nSquare Enix, like many other subscription-based MMO purveyors, occasionally dips into promos to get people to play Final Fantasy XIV, and another one is here. The Final Fantasy free login campaign starts today (it began at 1AM PT technically), and will run all the way through June 30 at 7:59AM PT.\nAs usual, there's some provisos. To be eligible, you needed to have previously bought and registered (the second point is salient, it can't be sitting in a closet somewhere), your service account needs to be inactive (without a sub), and you needed to have been inactive for \"at least 30 days.\" If all of that is true, you can log back into the game and play. For a limited period of time.\nYep, note the second proviso! The login period begins \"four days including the day on which users first log in.\" That period will unilaterally end on the \"fourth login day\" at 11:59PM PT. This starts after you login, not when you zone in and start doing something, so make it count.\nAs long as you're aware of the eligibility and the login restrictions, you should be fine. Just maybe do it on a lazy Thursday/Friday so you have the entire weekend to spare! My advice: use this Final Fantasy free login period to potentially finish up wherever you left off on the main story quest (MSQ). This will ensure that you're ready to fully embrace whatever the new content is when you decide to re-subscribe in earnest again.\nThe post Final Fantasy XIV is running a free login campaign for June 2022 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Yep, no Sonic kissing confirmed.\nSpeaking to Axios (via IGN), Sonic Frontiers producer (and long-time Sega designer) Takashi Iizuka mused on the issue when it was brought up, stating: \"I don't think we'll be doing that again.\" Iizuka has a clean conscience when it comes to the game in question too, as he didn't even work on it — instead opting to direct Shadow the Hedgehog, Sonic Riders, and Sonic Rivals around that same time. Iizuka also points out that two of the main Sonic rules are still in effect: including the obvious \"go fast\" rule, and the \"he can't swim\" rule.\nFor reference, the scene in question is from Sonic 2006, when Sonic the Hedgehog kissed a human woman. It was immediately clowned on directly after release, and when coupled with the fact that the game itself was one of the most egregious entries in the \"3D\" saga, it's one of the only notable things that anyone talks about when referencing the infamous 2006 game.\nThe post Sonic NOT kissing a human girl confirmed for Sonic Frontiers appeared first on Destructoid.",

That's partially why it's getting a whole GoldenEye 64 documentary!\nDirected by documentarian Drew Roller, it'll bring us through the journey of the game \"developer in a farmhouse in Warwickshire by a small ragtag team of university graduates, most of whom had never worked on a game before.\" Based on the trailer, the doc will take a look at how GoldenEye 64 (among several other games), changed the way shooters were perceived on consoles. There's interviews with past developers afoot, as well as tons of classic late '90s footage sprinkled in to take some of us back: or give younger folks a frame of reference for the \"Xtreme/Attitude\" period of the industry.\nIf you're interested, you can find the site for the production team here, which is where it'll debut in digital format on June 27. Although the digital platforms differ by region, it's currently being sold on iTunes [Apple TV] for roughly $9.99 USD, and the film clocks in at one hour and 39 minutes.\nIt's starting to get to the point where a lot of these retro games are \"ancient history,\" and can be looked at in the same way that old relics of the past (like Pong) were just 20 years ago.

Earlier this year in February, Clefairy was datamined for Pokemon Unite: which is still a possibility for the game.

A PlayStation Store listing not only had the name, but also a few pieces of art to go along with it.\nThough the listing is down now, users were quick to catch the relevant info and art (thanks, Escapist) before it went away.\nSadly, there wasn't anything about pricing, release date, or details about the upcoming project. All we have is the above and below images, one bearing the name Tactics Ogre Reborn.\n\nIf we want to over-analyze a bit, the above image struck me a bit because it is pretty darn similar to the box art of Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together. You can see the box art below (via MobyGames) has two similar characters and stances in front of a flag. Reborn, however, is stylized closer to Akih…",

The classic tale has been adapted to fit within the rock-'em, sock-'em Kunio-kun universe, complete with retro-inspired visuals, belt-scrolling brawler action, and a cast of familiar heroes and villains telling the tale of the fall of the Han Dynasty, albeit with far more groin kicks.\n\nIn addition to the story mode, River City Saga: Three Kingdoms will feature a multiplayer-centric side adventure, \"Heroes of the Three Kingdoms: Battle of Red Cliffs\". This is where our girls get to enter the fray, joining a roster of 24 Kunio-kun legends to battle through 10 stages of madcap action for one-to-four players. Both Kyoko and Misako have received something of a visual redesign in order to fit in with the period setting — and they both look just darling in the retro-contemporary duds.\nOf course, this cameo appearance will get the pint-sized pugilists warmed up for their own incoming release, River City Girls 2, which is currently in development at WayForward with a tentative launch window of summer 2022. You can check out information on the sequel in our previous reports here and here.\nRiver City Saga: Three Kingdoms launches July 21 on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch.\nRiver City Saga: Three Kingdoms adds Misako and Kyoko from River City Girls [Gematsu]\nThe post River City Girls bringin’ the brawl to River City Saga: Three Kingdoms appeared first on Destructoid.",

From the very first trailer I saw, I knew it was going to be one of those titles that delivers on aesthetic and concept, which can either be spectacular, or flop on its face. After playing a preview of American Arcadia for the Tribeca Games Fest, I have a feeling it will be leaning toward the former.\nSometimes a game can bite off more than it can chew with a bunch of different elements — more complexity isn't always better.

Speaking of, development will continue on the PC version as \"external teams\" handle the Xbox console ports.\nhttps://youtu.be/vPEGKJlE9LE\nIn addition to the Xbox port (the first half of 2023 is going to be hella busy for gaming, isn't it?), the companies also announced that Valheim will join the PC Game Pass library in fall 2022. The best part: all three versions of Valheim — Steam, Microsoft Store, and Xbox — will have cross-play support for co-op survival. You don't have to make new friends.\n\"The porting is being done by external teams, so the core team at Iron Gate is still focusing on the Mistlands,\" the studio tweeted. The new biome update will be more exploration-focused.\n\"None of this would be possible without the incredible teams at Piktiv and Fishlabs who are continuing to work tirelessly on the Microsoft Store and Xbox ports, enabling us to focus on the Mistlands update and our exciting journey through Early Access.\"\nI wouldn't be surprised to see Valheim show up on PS4 and PS5 eventually — I'm expecting a sort of Deep Rock Galactic situation — but nothing to report yet. When it comes to still-in-development early access games, PlayStation fans can expect to wait.\nIt's been a while since we checked in, but Valheim has cleared 10 million sales on Steam.\nThe post Valheim is headed to Xbox One and Series X/S in spring 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Sign-ups and full details will be shared during the stream (which starts at 10:00 a.m. Pacific), but for now, we know that the Overwatch 2 beta will begin on June 28, and it'll include PC and console players this time around.\nhttps://twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1536755605238697984\nIn terms of new content for this beta, an unnamed \"new map\" will join the rotation, and this will be players' first crack at Junker Queen, a long-time-coming Tank hero who appeared during Sunday's Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase. If you missed it, Blizzard also confirmed that Overwatch 2 will be free-to-play and launch on October 4, 2022.\nMy big takeaway recently as a Support player? Moira's deteriorating arm! Did you spot it?\nPC, PlayStation, and Xbox\nWhile Overwatch 2 is coming to all consoles (PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch), it would somewhat unsurprisingly seem that this beta will be limited to PlayStation, Xbox, and Battle.net based on those logos in the announcement image.\nSo far, PvP has been front and center, but plenty of lapsed Overwatch players are holding out for something special with PvE to bring them back into the fold — I hope the June 16 event gives us some much-needed clarity on that front. My time with the previous Overwatch 2 PC beta was short and not that sweet, and Chris wasn't really feeling it either in his initial check-in. After some updates (I'm still laughing about Zenyatta's high-impact kick) and admissions that there's much more to be done, I feel like there is a way to eventually ignite widespread excitement for the sequel, but it's been pretty dicey so far.\nAccording to the team, they've \"only just scratched the surface.\" So let's hear it!\nThe post Overwatch 2’s console and PC beta starts June 28 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Redfall kicked off the recent Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase with a brand new look at gameplay. Bethesda also revealed additional information about the game, including details about its different characters, co-op, and more. \nFollowing that reveal, Redfall game designer Harvey Smith spoke to IGN in a new interview about the title’s co-op and how it works. Here, Smith revealed that Redfall’s campaign progress is tied to the host of the co-op party and that it’s only persistent for that host, as reported by GamesRadar. This means that if you’re teaming up with someone to play co-op and you’re not the host, you will not receive the campaign progress they might after completing a level. \n\n\n“So for the flow of things, you want to have to redo those,” Smith said. “The story would be very confusing if you got to mission eight and it said, ‘skip this one because you’ve already done it.'\"\nSmith said that Arkane initially tried to give every player some “credit” for completing a given level when they aren’t the host. However, this didn’t work out, as those same players would then run into that same mission again when playing solo or as the host of their own co-op session. However, Smith told IGN that character progression aspects such as loot and XP would carry over to your campaign. \nOf course, with Redfall recently delayed out of 2022 and into 2023, things could change. In the meantime, watch Bethesda’s thrilling and bloody Redfall gameplay recently revealed, and then catch up on all the biggest gaming news from the 2022 Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase. \n[Source: IGN via GamesRadar]\nAre you going to play Redfall solo or in co-op?

          "description": "Bethesda and Xbox gave Starfield the spotlight during its recent weekend showcase, revealing more than 15 minutes of new footage and information from director Todd Howard. \nThe studio didn’t mention this during the showcase, but shortly after, the Bethesda Game Studios Twitter account revealed some new details about dialogue in Starfield and how your created character – the protagonist of the game – interacts with NPCs. In short, speaking to NPCs will happen in first-person, and your character will remain silent as they do not have a voice.\nYes, dialogue in @StarfieldGame is first person and your character does not have a voice. pic.twitter.com/A8384m6rGN\nJune 13, 2022\nAs you can see in the tweet above, the studio has cleared up some possible confusion around the created character we’ll all be playing in Starfield. This reveal has been praised by some and criticized by others. Some Bethesda fans prefer the studio’s RPGs where you remain silent, while others prefer their character to have a voice they can hear in-game. \nI’m cool with either. I hope Starfield’s dialogue is more akin to Fallout 3 than Fallout 4, though. In the former, you’d see essentially all of the dialogue your choice would result in, whereas in Fallout 4, your choices were more like mood options, giving just a general view of that choice’s dialogue. It took away some of my character’s agency, and I’m hoping Starfield restores that a bit. Only time will tell for now, though. \nStarfield will hit Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC sometime in 2023.\nFor more, read Game Informer’s Starfield analysis after its recent gameplay showing, and then check out this story about Todd Howard confirming that Fallout 5 is the next game Bethesda Game Studios will develop after Elder Scrolls 6 (which is the next game the studio will release after Starfield). \nWhat are your thoughts on Bethesda RPG dialogue?

He also uttered the name “Fallout 5” and gave an idea of when fans can expect to see it. \nSpeaking to Ryan McCaffrey, Howard confirmed that Fallout 5 will be the next game after The Elder Scrolls 6, which itself has entered pre-production:\n\"Yes, Elder Scrolls 6 is in pre-production and, you know, we’re going to be doing Fallout 5 after that, so our slate’s pretty full going forward for a while. We have some other projects that we look at from time to time as well.\"\nFollowing up on Starfield’s big gameplay demonstration at the Xbox + Bethesda Showcase, Howard revealed additional facts about the new IP. Starfield's main story is 30-40 hours long, or 20% larger than any Bethesda game to date. New Atlantis, one of Starfield’s four main cities and capital of the United Colonies, is also the largest city Bethesda has ever made. For character creation, Howard states there are roughly 20 character backgrounds to choose from. \nThe game’s procedural galaxy features the most hand-made content ever made by the studio. Boasting over 1000 planets that players can visit, Howard also clarified you cannot fly to each one seamlessly a la No Man’s Sky, describing the on-the-ground action and space gameplay as two separate experiences. In terms of space combat, Howard discusses how dogfighting (which he describes as having a slower pace) takes cues from games like FTL and MechWarrior and confirms that players can steal the ships they board. \nStarfield launches in 2023 for Xbox Series X/S and PC. \n[Source: IGN]",

While many of us will likely never get our hands on some of these unless we actually go to the show or find a vendor online, they're always fun to look at. This year, Funko is releasing a series of SDCC-exclusive Pop! figures. Game Informer can exclusively reveal the Pop Games: Sonic – Super Sonic First Appearance vinyl figure.\nThis version of Super Sonic features the ability to glow in the dark, paying tribute to his signature golden aura from the games, TV shows, comics, and movies. This vinyl figure stands at approximately 5.3 inches and gives the appearance it's floating above its stand. While I haven't seen the figure in person, the floating illusion probably combines with the glow-in-the-dark feature to create a cool effect when the lights dim.\n\nThis San Diego Comic-Con exclusive Funko Pop! figure comes in a box with either a \"2022 Summer Convention Exclusive\" sticker or the \"2022 San Diego Comic-Con\" sticker on the box. Despite the image in the gallery above featuring the latter, the sticker on the box isn't guaranteed. This year marks the iconic convention's grand return to the San Diego Convention Center for the first time since 2019. San Diego Comic-Con runs from July 21 to July 24.",

          "description": "Despite not having a trailer at the main Xbox and Bethesda showcase this weekend, eagle-eyed viewers may have spotted a popular survival title alongside the 2023 Xbox releases in an image near the show's end. Today it was confirmed that inclusion was very intentional, as Valheim is not only coming to Game Pass on PC this fall but will be coming to consoles and will be exclusive to Xbox when it launches in 2023.\n\n\nThe Norse-themed cooperative survival game was released into Early Access on Steam in February of last year when it quickly blew up in popularity, selling over 3 million copies in its first few weeks on sale. For people like myself who never took the plunge on Valheim, its addition to PC Game Pass in a few months is a welcomed sight, as is its inclusion in the Microsoft Store on Windows.\nThe other big news for Valheim is three-fold. First, the game is officially coming to consoles for the first time. There has been talk of its eventuality since controller support was added to the PC version earlier this year, but it's nice to finally have confirmation. When this port does land on Xbox sometime in the first half of 2023, full cross-play will be enabled to team up with any number of PC and console players. Although, no other consoles will be involved since Microsoft has locked down console exclusivity for Valheim, so don't expect to see the game show up on PlayStation or Switch anytime soon.\nIf you can't wait until Valheim joins Game Pass on your Microsoft platform of choice, it's available to purchase right now on Steam.",

          "description": "GSC Game World has confirmed that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl will now arrive in 2023. To hold fans over, the team released a new cinematic during today's Xbox Games Extended Showcase.\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 was slated to launch on December 2, but development was put on hold when the studio became caught in the crossfire of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. GSC Game World is based in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital and some employees have helped defend the city. Given the situation, it seemed increasingly unlikely the game would make it this year, so today’s announcement isn’t totally unexpected. Although GSC is still working out of Kyiv, most of the game's development has resumed at a new office established in Prague, Czech Republic.\nMeanwhile, a new trailer further establishes S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2's gloomy atmosphere.  \n\n\nIn addition, a developer diary documents the state of GSC Game World during the start of Russia's invasion and how it banded together amidst days of bombings (contains disturbing imagry of the war so viewer discretion is advised).\n\n\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl will launch on Xbox Series X/S and PC.",

          "description": "GoldenEye 007 redefined the shooter genre when it launched on Nintendo 64 in 1997. Moving away from other classic heavyweights like Doom and Wolfenstein, Rare's acclaimed James Bond FPS opted for aesthetic realism, intense single-player campaign levels, deep stealth mechanics with cognizant AI, and, of course, PvP deathmatch. GoldenEra, an upcoming GoldenEye 007 documentary, spotlights the development of the influential FPS. \n\n\nThe trailer, uploaded on IGN, features snippets of developer insight into the creation of GoldenEye 007. Designers stated that, at one point, FPS titles were primarily made for PC audiences. GoldenEye, of course, made waves when it found critical and commercial success on consoles. Next-gen game-changers like Halo and Call of Duty, then, were directly informed by the tight gunplay and combat mechanics of GoldenEye. Be sure to watch the trailer above for more insight. \nGoldenEra will be available digitally this month on June 27.\n[Source: IGN]",

A new game plus option was implemented months ago, and optimization updates keep the gameplay fine-tuned and responsive. Post-launch plans continue to be underway as a new update – 1.4.0 – drops today with the first \"Chapter,\" bringing photo mode and new zombies to the open-world parkour adventure. \nSo, what are the most significant features coming to the game today? A post on the Dying Light website details the introduction of a new NPC named Harper, a rank system to help players build a rapport with Harper as they complete his tasks, daily/weekly bounties, more high-tier gear, two new currencies, never-before-seen infected enemies like the Mutated Infected, Volatile Tyrant, and Volatile Hive, and a time trial Chapter Mission. \nOf course, there's also the photo mode (only available in single-player) that comes with filters, special effects, and more. Other tweaks are incoming to help balance and streamline the fun – we're talking gameplay, co-op, UI/UX, and technical updates. Read all about it by clicking the link in the previous paragraph. \nLike its prequel, Dying Light 2 Stay Human is set to get much developer support even as Techland begins developing its new fantasy action-RPG. So, eager Pilgrims will have many opportunities to expand upon Aiden's already-harrowing journey.\nWill you be diving into the 1.4.0 update today?

          "description": "Capcom leveraged its summer showcase event today to reveal some new details on Exoprimal, the upcoming action and shooting game in which players control warriors in exosuits as they fight off rampaging hordes of dinosaurs. An out-of-control AI called Leviathan is unleashing these dinosaurs through rifts in the sky, and forcing humans to fight them off in intricate (and frankly inexplicable) wargames – usually at high risk of death and destruction of urban landscapes.\nExoprimal's main event is called Dino Survival, where you join up in a multiplayer team of five and compete against another team to complete very specific objectives.\n\n\nThose mission objectives are varied and dynamic. In Dinosaur Cull, your team must hunt and take down one specific dinosaur. VTOL Defense demands that your team protect an aircraft on the ground as it gets swarmed by the charging reptiles. Data Key Security is an escort-style mission, in which you must deliver a particular asset from one location to the next. Omega Charge is a mission in which players have access to a swarm-clearing Omega Hammer. And Energy Taker, as you might suspect, is all about gathering more energy than the opposing team.\nInterestingly, Exoprimal will include sequences where you directly engage enemy players, but also moments where you team up to take down especially dangerous threats. No matter who you’re fighting against, you’ll earn XP to power up both your player character and their exosuit levels.\nCapcom shared that Exoprimal will soon enter a closed network test, which should allow players to get a taste of the action. If you’re interested, you can sign up at exoprimal.com.\nExoprimal is targeting a release on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, and Steam, sometime in 2023.",

          "description": "Today during the Capcom Showcase livestream, the company touched base on its recently-announced Resident Evil 4 remake – including showing all of a few seconds of gameplay. Admittedly, especially coming off the other deep dives of the presentation, it was pretty disappointing. \nDirector Yasuhiro Anpo and producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi led the presentation, filling players in on the story of RE4 and talking about how the game is both a reimagining of the source material and a faithful adaptation. Set six years after the events of Resident Evil 2 and 3, RE4 protagonist Leon Kennedy is now the personal bodyguard of the United States president. When the president's daughter goes missing, Leon is dispatched to a remote European village to find her. As you might expect, things don't go well. \n\n\nWe then see our first look at gameplay, and to be clear, visually, it looks great. The footage is set during the very beginning of the game, when Leon arrives outside the village in the forest. Compared to the original game, the forest is far darker and scarier. \"We want to nail the feeling of loneliness and fear of not knowing what lies ahead, even more so than the original,\" Hirabayashi said during the presentation. \"Of course, there will also be thrilling battles.\"\nYou'd be excused if you expected a glimpse at those thrilling battles, but unfortunately, no such look came. Our look at gameplay ends as Leon walks up to a house in the middle of the forest – which ostensibly is where Leon encounters the first Ganado, as is the case in the original RE4. \nI'm more excited for the Resident Evil 4 remake than any other game we currently know about; the original is one of my all-time favorite games. Which makes this reveal fairly disappointing. I would've loved an actual look at the game, but that wasn't in the cards today. Here's hoping we'll get a better look in the future.",

          "description": "Resident Evil Village made a surprise return during today's Capcom Showcase. After revealing the game has sold over six million copies worldwide, Capcom revealed a Gold Edition is on the way, boasting a number of notable additions. First up is a new story expansion called Shadows of Rose, which puts Rose in the lead for a mind-bending journey of discovery.\n\n\nIn this story, Rose, who is the daughter of Ethan, is in her teens or twenties. From the outset of play, you learn she's struggling with her powers. To try and control them, she enters the consciousness of the Megamycete and that's where the madness begins. Time and space are warped and she sees someone that looks just like her. The entire game is set from the third-person perspective.\nCapcom is adding that new viewpoint to the core game, allowing players to see Ethan and experience the game much like Resident Evil 4 with over-the-shoulder aiming.\nLastly, Mercenaries mode is getting fleshed out with new missions and playable characters like Chris Redfield, Alcina Dimitrescu, and Karl Heisenberg. Lady Dimitrescu stands in at over nine feet in height.\nIf you already played through Resident Evil Village, you won't have to buy this Gold Edition and will just need to get the new Winter's Expansion, which contains all three additions.

          "description": "After a release in Asian markets last month, the overhaul of PlayStation Plus is available today in North and South America. Here's everything you'll need to know about upgrading your plan.\nThree tiers are now available, offering larger numbers of features, games, and trials to play as you go up in pricing, which is available in one-month, three-month, and 12-month subscriptions. Brief descriptions of what you get in each tier can be found below. \nUpgrading is fairly painless but will require a prorated upcharge to join the new Extra or Premium plans of PlayStation Plus. To do so, go to your PS+ tab on your PlayStation console. There, you'll find an option to upgrade. On PS5, it showed each tier and how much money it would cost to upgrade for the remainder of the month, which for most should only be a few dollars. Upon upgrading, it will tell you your next payment date and that it will charge you for a full-year subscription on that day. Don't panic. There is a way to change your subscription type. \nHow To Change Your Subscription Type From Yearly To Monthly\nThere are various ways of getting to your subscription settings, but here is the most foolproof.

Rotwood is a multiplayer action game, and it's expected to enter early access at some point, but that date is up in the air for now.\n\n\nThanks to the Steam description, we know a little more about Rotwood than what was revealed in the trailer. It's a roguelike dungeon crawler designed to be played with up to four people. Each run will bring your cute animal avatars through a dangerous forest where the challenge amplifies the deeper you go in. New armor and weapons can be crafted from items scavenged, and a safe haven can be built up and fortified as well.\nIn typical Klei style, the hand-drawn look of the characters and enemies is unreal. Once again, the studio is pushing the boundaries of making it look like you're controlling a cartoon character; Rotwood's models are expressive, fluid, and bursting with personality. I can't wait to see what Rotwood looks and plays like in action when I can eventually get my hands on it.\nThe trailer gave an early access date of \"202?\" which could be anytime in the next decade, though I'd expect us to play it well before 2030. Rotwood can be wishlisted on Steam, and it's unknown whether Klei is planning for release on any additional platforms at this time.",

You can watch the trailer below for yourself, along with an interview with series creator and industry luminary Warren Spector.\n\n\nThis new trailer for System Shock gives a great look at the game's visual style, which toes the line of using modern graphical techniques while paying homage to the low-res look of the original game. More specifically, some of the in-game panels and monitors are intentionally blocky and pixelated, as if they were textures from a 90s first-person shooter. SHODAN, the antagonistic AI who is ever-present in System Shock, is also a prominent feature in the trailer as she talks smack to the player as they explore the Citadel Station.\nSystem Shock is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

The Alters is a sci-fi adventure where one man trying to survive and get home from a mission that's gone wrong finds all the help he needs in himself. Or rather, himselves.\n\n\n \nJan Dolski, the main character, turns to The Alters, or alternate versions of himself that differ from him in ways that will help them all survive. The Alters each have different skills and character traits, so even though they all look like Jan, they'll fill specific roles in the mission to get home. The trailer shows Jan and The Alters' ship, a giant wheel-like craft with a series of shipping container units held together at the center.\nDuring the presentation, 11 Bit Studios' Lead Artist Tomasz Kisikewicz says the game has aspects of a psychological thriller, with a dash of horror, but also obviously deals with surrealism. He also says this lands in a \"classic sci-fi\" story by taking a relatable topic and applying these fictional science solutions like creating alternate selves, but the gameplay is contemporary with a focus on system design and non-linear gameplay. It's designed for players to create their own stories.\n \n\nIt seems like it's far too early for a release date, but we do know The Alters will be coming to PC whenever it does end up launching.",

What was shown is compelling, and it may be an understatement to say, but this game looks stunning.\n\n\nThe demo begins from the perspective of Yasna, a hazmat-suited explorer as she ventures into a dusty and irradiated facility. Her cohort Novik supports her on comms as she delves deeper into the mysterious local. She soon comes across a deactivated Antimatter cannon and later a robot looping a task it's been engaged in for who knows how long. The tech of The Invincible is retro-futuristic, which gives the rundown facility and gadgets Yasna uses a lot of character and charm. Yasna pulls out a handheld tracker with a field of tiny lights and uses it to discover a body buried in the sands beneath her feet, confirming this place isn't at all safe. Then, the antimatter cannon surges to life, takes aim, and blows the robot worker away with a spectacular beam of particles before turning its sights dead on our protagonist.\nI'm not usually one for slow-paced first-person narrative games, but this look at The Invincible had me on the edge of my seat, and I can't wait to see more. The Invincible is coming sometime in 2023 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

It is coming to Xbox consoles and PC this November. \nRevealed during today’s Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase, Pentiment looks like quite the departure from what Obsidian has released over the past few years. Nonetheless, the project looks fascinating. The game features quite a unique visual style that looks reminiscent of an old medieval painting or book. This makes sense, too, because Pentiment is not an RPG like The Outer Worlds or a survival game like the studio’s Grounded, but rather, a narrative adventure game. \nCheck out the trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nHere’s how Xbox describes Pentiment in the YouTube trailer description: \n“Set in 16th century Bavaria, Pentiment will take players on a narrative journey through the eyes of Journeyman Artist Andreas Maler during a time of great social unrest. Led by game director Josh Sawyer, this game is brought to life by a talented team inspired by illuminated manuscripts, woodcut prints, and history itself.” \nPentiment hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC this November. \nWhile waiting for its release, read Game Informer’s review of The Outer Worlds and then read about Obsidian’s next RPG, Avowed.\nAre you excited for Pentiment?

During the platform's Summer Game Fest event today, we got our first glimpse at a new project from Limbo and Inside lead designer Jeppe Carlsen.\nCocoon, published by Annapurna Interactive, which has a showcase of its own next month, promises to be a mind-bending experience with an undeniably compelling art style. The creators promise to take players \"on an adventure across worlds within worlds,\" which are represented by a series of unusual glowing orbs in the trailer. The clip begins with a sweeping and stylized view of a desert landscape which is soon disturbed by a blinding beam of white light. Our hero pops out of a mechanical-looking cocoon energized by the laser and appears to be a kind of beetle. We mostly see it grabbing and distributing globes of various colors, which may allow it to jump to different locations.\n\n\n There's not a lot to glean from this reveal trailer, but the game's Steam page goes into a little more detail. \nCocoon is set to release on Xbox consoles (via Game Pass), Switch, and PC sometime in 2023. The trailer's description indicates fans should get ready to \"master world-leaping mechanics to unravel a cosmic mystery.\"",

          "description": "We still don't have a firm Diablo IV release date yet (other than 2023), but we now know every class we can play when it eventually releases. The necromancer joins the previously announced barbarian, sorceress, rogue, and druid, all allowing for high levels of customization.\nAs you dive into dangerous open areas, you'll be hunting the disciples of Lilith, the daughter of hatred. In new gameplay footage, developer Blizzard Entertainment says Diablo IV offers over 150 dungeons, along with territories to reclaim, and story sequences that occur as you explore. Some of these story moments could lead to massive boss battles that require numerous players.\n\n\nDiablo IV offers cross-play between console and PC, and also two-player couch play for people in the same household. If you play a bunch and become incredibly powerful, the game will highlight you as a champion, which other players can see. Along with the high number of dungeons, Blizzard claims the endgame is deep and will continue to expand years after release.\nBlizzard says they are close to completing development, but has only given an open 2023 timeframe for release.",

The reveal trailer, which you can watch below, doesn’t feature any gameplay but it gave us quite the taste of Fallen Dynasty’s world.\n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, the character that appears to be the protagonist of Fallen Dynasty is fighting off barbarian enemies before consuming something that turns them into a massive demon dragon monster that looks terrifying. Here’s what the trailer description for Fallen Dynasty says about the game: \nIt looks great, albeit a little scary, and fortunately, we don’t have to wait too long to check it out because Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC in early 2023. \nFor more, read Game Informer’s Nioh review, and then check out our thoughts on Nioh 2 after that. \nAre you excited for Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty?

          "description": "Ebb Software showed a new trailer for Scorn at today’s Xbox Games Showcase, and the first-person horror adventure continues to look just as disturbing as ever.\nDrawing clear lines of inspiration from the famous artist, H.R. Giger, Scorn features some of the same disconcerting imagery that is a part of the art from movies like Alien, in which biological and mechanical elements seem to merge.\nThe new trailer continues to embrace those elements, with more than a little bit of body horror mixed in for good measure. The video shows numerous instances of disconnected human appendages attached to strange, non-human machines and creatures. And the protagonist appears to be horribly mutilated in the brief glimpses we get of their arms and other body parts.\nEbb has stated in the past that Scorn is aiming for a cohesive “lived-in” world, in which players are thrown in the deep-end by arriving and having to try and grasp what is even happening in the spaces they explore. Environments are said to be maze-like and individual regions are open and exploreable, but interconnected with other distinct spaces.\nThe developers are also touting the game’s focus on full-body awareness. Rather than have items simply floating in the world and having them picked up by magic, every object is a real thing that your character must lift or move with their own hands, hopefully leading to a greater sense of immersion. And, given the subject matter, a likely greater sense of disquiet.\nWhile the environment and creature design is certainly impressive, I continue to have a number of questions about the nature of gameplay in the project. I’m eager to understand more about the nature of the puzzles and characters that are part of the surreal game world, but this latest trailer does little to illuminate either.\nScorn is headed to Xbox Game Pass, but more generally will be available on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, and on the Cloud when it releases on October 21, 2022.",

Today, at the Xbox Games Showcase, it was not only confirmed, but a high-speed trailer featuring the toy cars from our childhoods whizzed across the screen on the tracks and red loops we've come to know. You can watch the trailer above. The expansion hits on July 19. \nPREVIOUS STORY\nAccording to Eurogamer, Forza Horizon 5’s first expansion – a Hot Wheels crossover – leaked on the Steam store listing and was immediately taken down. The listing was posted to Reddit, where it gained traction. You can see the image of the crossover below. \nThis wouldn’t be the first time the two car-racing giants joined forces. Hot Wheels DLC packages sped onto the scenic tracks of Forza Motorsport 5 and Forza Horizon 3 and 4. What Playground Games has in store with its latest arcade racing simulator is anyone’s guess. \nForza Horizon 5 cracked Game Informer’s Top 10 Games of 2021 list: \n“To merely say Forza Horizon 5 is among the most mechanically sound racing games ever created would be a disservice and overlook what makes the game worthy of praise. Yes, the foundational act of driving feels fantastic, but it’s the rest of the package that truly elevates this fifth entry in the series to the rarified air that demands a place on our list of the top 10 games of the year.”\nAre you excited about the alleged crossover?\n[Source: Eurogamer]",

It'll also have a new character called The Junker Queen who got her own cinematic trailer, introducing her Mad-Max-meets-punk-rock persona in a handicap match against some nasty-looking fellas.

His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh's main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.\nMichael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.\nEmanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.\nAvijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet's task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.\nThe team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.\nPlease give a warm welcome to our new students! Let's make GSoC 2022 a huge success – together!\n>",
