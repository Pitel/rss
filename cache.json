          "description": "Back in the mists of time, I actually had a hands on with Ubisoft's pirate 'em up Skull And Bones once. In my memory of it, I was an adolescent, which was categorically not the case and probably more a product of the booths at Gamescom being very tall, not to mention the hands on taking place so very long ago. At that time, the game was essentially the naval combat bit from AC: Black Flag, carved out and extended to be its own thing. Now, years later and with many delays and reworks bobbing about in its wake, Skull And Bones is back, and looking a bit different.\nThe current state of play for Skull And Bones was revealed with a livestream tonight, featuring an explainer video walking you through some of the game features, a chonk of the game in piratical action, and a surprisingly close release date confirmation for the 8th of November 2022 (there's still time for it to be delayed again!). All those extra months in the oven have produced a decidedly Sea Of Thieves-shaped bun. But this one is all realistic and gritty, more complicated, and is taking itself seriously. You won't catch Skull And Bones announcing its new season features with a comedy song, that's for sure.\nRead more",

Alas, while buyers of the PlayStation deluxe digital edition will also get to enjoy a brand-new port of PSP game Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth (an enhanced version of the very first Valkyrie game), Square Enix have decided not to include it in the equivalent PC edition. No, instead we’re being offered three desktop wallpapers, and a special in-game sword. Don your horned helmet and take a deep breath before you watch the trailer below.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I've taken a dustpan and brush to the map, sweeping up optional bosses and forts and quests with the wild energy of a cleaner who mustn't stop for even a second.

          "description": "Dragon Age is one of my favourite game series. I replayed Dragon Age: Origins recently not for this column, but for fun. That's the kind of wild gal I am. Origins was one of the reasons I got into PC gaming, because my dinky laptop wasn't good enough to run it and I was desperate to play it after seeing the trailers. I spaffed some of my student loan on a new desktop and spent four months eating nothing but cheese sandwiches. At the time it felt worth it. Watching those trailers now is like opening a time capsule full of fantasy tropes and, for some reason, an incongruous chugging guitar song by someone we don't need to mention ever again.\nReplaying it now is a different experience. It's still a really cool RPG, notable for very good world-building and a cast of interesting characters (that you can have sex with in a cold tent), and it continues to hold a dear place in my heart. On the other hand, there's a whole section that's such a mind-numbing slog to get through that everyone hates it and there's a mod specifically to remove it from the entire game. Origins is a game I very much like, yet sometimes struggle to explain why it is good. But I'm not alone in thinking so, 'cos in 2009 this was RPS's Game Of The Year. Can't blame me for that. I didn't even work here then.\nRead more",

That’s because PCIe 5.0 drives are coming and, while they’re set to outpace even the best SSDs that use the current-gen PCIe 4.0 interface, it sounds like such speed will come at the cost of higher temperatures.

Shots that, even with a 90% chance of hitting their target, still end up going wide and punching a hole in your carefully laid plans. In the moment, they induce feelings of white hot injustice, but for many, they're an integral part of what makes XCOM, well, XCOM. Looking back on his time making XCOM 2, however, Firaxis' creative director Jake Solomon tells me that he, too, now feels the pain players have felt for close to a decade.  \n\"It was really interesting for me to return back and play XCOM a couple of years ago, and man, when I missed shots, I was unbelievably frustrated.

Amazon’s Prime Day landing page might already point to various bits of discounted PC hardware but you won’t be limited to the big A alone, as plenty of rival retailers will be running their own, competing sales.

But it wasn’t always this simple, oh no. It used to be pretty slim pickings for us Sonicsters, and I’m here to tell you what we fought through to get to the promised land of ports we bask in today.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I loved Monster Hunter: Rise when I first played it on Switch last year, but I’ll admit that I sort of sleep-walked through its entirety, dreamily kicking the tails off a couple of raptors before making them into a fashionable pair of hot pants. This wasn’t a bad thing, mind. Far from it. I found Rise to be a substantially better-paced MonHunt entry compared to its predecessors, the series’ steep barrier to entry readjusted to a gentle incline that was more palatable for newcomers like me. Monster Hunter’s particular flavour of RPG design has always felt like trying to find a fork in a friend’s kitchen while they’re in another room. Nothing is where you expect it to be and there are a lot of things here you just don’t understand. Admittedly Rise wasn’t much better, stuffed as it was with endless text-based tutorials, but at the very least it pointed out the right drawer this time around. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Emmanuele Bassi v zásadě souhlasí, X11 už nedostává žádnou novou funkcionalitu a framework GTK se již delší dobu architektonicky posouvá směrem k Waylandu, jeho API se tak běhu na X11 stále vzdaluje. Dodává také, že řeči jsou jedna věc, ale pokud kód [podpory X11] nikdo nenapíše, tak prostě nebude.",

          "description": "Now you can take Dicey Dungeons on the go\nDicey Dungeons is one of those \"if you know, you know\" indie games — it's garnered something of a cult following over the past three years that it's been out, and for good reason (we gave it a 10 in our review). The charming visuals, unique concept, and engaging gameplay have made the game a continued success, and after some releases for Nintendo Switch and Xbox, Dicey Dungeons is finally getting a mobile release for iOS and Android. In addition to the new platform, the game is also getting a free DLC update called Reunion, which will give players 4-5 hours of new gameplay released in six episodes.\nThe game's creator Terry Cavanagh dropped the news earlier today on his Twitter — he's also known for creating other titles like VVVVVV and Super Hexagon. Cavanagh has secured his spot as a prolific game designer in the indie space, so it's really cool to see his games continue to have life and community surrounding them long after their releases.\nhttps://twitter.com/terrycavanagh/status/1545076959444717569\nNot only will Dicey Dungeons run well on mobile devices, but its gameplay actually suits the platform really well. Roguelikes are great to play in short bursts, and since it's turn-based, you don't have to be glued to the screen every second if you don't want to be. That makes Dicey Dungeons perfect for playing on your phone during a commute, or when you're waiting at the DMV, or when you're doing literally anything else.\nCavanagh even confirmed in the replies to his initial tweet that you can easily stop in the middle of a run and continue it later without losing any of your progress.\nDicey Dungeons is available for $4.99 on iOS and Android, and the free DLC update is live now as well. The game's composer Chipzel also released the DLC soundtrack on Bandcamp if you want to take a listen to that as well.\nThe post Adorable roguelike Dicey Dungeons gets a mobile release, new DLC appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The King of the Koopas gets a LEGO makeover\nMaking LEGO sets that are designed with adults in mind is one of the best decisions the company ever made, because LEGO has released some really awesome, complex builds over the past few years. Just in their Nintendo collaboration alone, which debuted in 2020, they gave us the buildable NES and the \"?\" block with different levels from Super Mario 64 on the inside. LEGO's newest release is another banger in the Mario-themed line: a giant Bowser that shoots fireballs.\nI have to admit that I haven't played with LEGO since I was a kid, but man, they've really stepped up their game over the past few years. The Might Bowser figure is made of up over 3,000 pieces, some of which were designed specifically for this build. He's incredibly detailed, but this Bowser doesn't just look great — you can move his head around and shoot a little LEGO fireball out of his mouth. In addition, the Senior Designer on the project Carl Merriam says that they \"took inspiration from a few forms of puppetry\" and added loose joints to Bowser's legs and tail so he looks like he's jumping when you pick him up.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UKbllLOr44\nBut wait, there's more! LEGO fans who own a LEGO Super Mario Starter Course can actually battle against Bowser with Mario, Luigi, or Peach.\nBasically, if you take your little interactive figure from that set and bounce it on Bowser, it will make noises from the game and play battle animations. How cool is that? It's that extra attention to detail that makes this a really impressive build, in my opinion.\nThe Mighty Bowser figure hits stores on October 1, 2022, and will retail for $269.99 on the LEGO website or wherever LEGO is sold, so start saving up now if you're dying to add him to your collection!\nThe post LEGO Super Mario’s latest release is a giant Bowser that shoots fireballs appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Shiny adventure to become shinier still\nTHQ Nordic has announced that it will release an upgraded edition of its zen-like adventure game Biomutant on PS5 and Xbox Series X this fall. The revamped release will be available to purchase on both platforms from September 6, with free upgrades offered to PS4 and Xbox One Biomutant players.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PismKvxhFpc\nReleased in the spring of 2021 after a particularly lengthy development period, Biomutant is an ecological tale of a fantasy world under siege from a mysterious and creeping corruption. Players guide a fully customizable character through the anthropomorphic society on a mission to rescue the Tree of Life, the roots of which are decaying due to the corruption's presence. Developed by Experiment 101, Biomutant was an extremely ambitious project, that unfortunately launch to very middling reviews, though it was praised for its impressive visuals and interesting custom character mechanics.\nThis new edition of Biomutant will offer players three distinct visual modes on PS5 and Xbox Series X. \"Quality,\" which will run at 30 FPS  at a 4K resolution; \"Quality Unleashed,\" which will run at \"40-plus\" FPS at a 4K resolution; and \"Performance,\" which will run at 60 FPS at 1440p. For Xbox Series S users, these three modes will run at 1440p, 1440p, and 1080p respectively. The PS5 edition will also be optimized for the DualSense, offering support for Haptic Feedback, adaptive triggers, and speaker sound. Both editions will support faster load times and will arrive fully updated in regards to patches.\nBiomutant is available now on PS4, Xbox One, and PC.\nThe post Biomutant PS5 and Xbox Series X upgrade coming in September appeared first on Destructoid.",

Digital artist Finn shared the latest footage of their Super Mario RPG remake on Twitter, which reworks the graphical system of the game into a new charming modern style.\nNote that Finn has their response to the \"but you shouldn't share these types of things online\" statement already ready to go:\n\"Just thought I’d put this out there since I’ve seen some stuff floating around: My SMRPG project, while made in a game engine, will not be available to play, for legal reasons:) similarly, I do not plan to remake a significant portion of the game as to not infringe on copyright.\"\n\nThat's why I put the phrase \"mockup\" in the headline. While this was initially shared around as a project that could see the light of day, Finn cleared things up themselves; noting that they wanted to share their artistry with the world without distributing it, or remaking the entire game.\nStill, you love to see it. These types of fan projects lead to full official releases more often than you'd think, and although it would take a lot of legwork to get this one off the ground, I hope it happens one day.\nhttps://twitter.com/huckori/status/1542926937055588352\nThe post A Super Mario RPG fan remake mockup?

Regardless of the depressing state of our country, the holiday got me thinking about Americana in video games and how they depict our country, for better and for worse.\nAside from Japan, the United States is the world’s leader in video game production, so it makes perfect sense that developers would borrow themes, imagery, and iconography from their country of origin. Sometimes it’s to pay homage to where they came from, other times it’s with the express purpose of critiquing the systems and ideals that run our nation, and sometimes it’s a…",

That was the question asked by Studio FYQD's dynamic PC actioner Bright Memory: Infinite. And soon, console owners can find the answer to that query themselves, with a PS5, Xbox Series X, and Switch port releasing on July 21.\nThe work of almost a single developer, Bright Memory: Infinite tells the anime-infused tale of Shelia, a special agent dispatched to scenes of inexplicable anomalies. Kitted out with some incredible firepower and acrobatic, air-slicing sword skills, Shelia finds herself embroiled in interdimensional chaos, fighting off an army of invaders and questionable governmental conspirators in the eye of a raging storm.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AhrdkGVV2Q\nWhile the trailers may give something of an impression of a full-price, 30-hour adventure, it should be noted that Bright Memory: Infinite is a very short affair, working better as a flashy score-attack title, to be played and replayed in efforts to achieve a slicker and more balletic performance each time. It's undeniably a fabulous-looking title, and the talent of its one-man team cannot be understated, but it's certainly something of an acquired taste. I dig it.\nBright Memory: Infinite is available now on PC, it will arrive on PS5, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch on July 21. The console port will feature all previously released costume DLC and support for Haptic Feedback, Gyroscopic Aiming, and other console-specific features.\nThe post Bright Memory: Infinite brings its battle angel to consoles July 21 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Genre, scope, and budget are all top of mind when it comes to licensed games like this. And to me, this team is a wildcard. I am vaguely into the idea of fighting for life in an intimidating machine-dominated world, though.\nAre you open to a Skynet survival game, or have you had your fill of Terminator tie-ins by now? Come to think of it, I've gone pretty deep in the Sega Genesis and SNES libraries over the years, but I've never touched RoboCop Versus The Terminator.

Ubisoft's Skull and Bones is launching on November 8, 2022 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and cloud streaming services.\nFirst up in today's gameplay reveal of Skull and Bones was a cinematic trailer, which showed the general set-up of the game. You start out as just another person awash at sea, in a region inspired by the Indian Ocean. Over time you build up resources, get bigger boats, and take on bigger risks for greater rewards.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8i2eHxj5NMU\nAs shown in the gameplay deep-dive, Skull and Bones allows players to set out for plunder on the high seas. They won't be alone, however. There's the ability to take on neutral, AI-controlled ships like merchant caravans or even fortresses, or you can sail with friends. In PvP servers, you can even run into and fight with other players.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_c7F4PHzcc\nIt's got some extraction vibes, similar to games like Escape From Tarkov. Get in, loot, get out. As time goes on, the player can craft new and better ships with different playstyles. If the ship goes down, the player will head back to the most recent outpost with most of their cargo recovered, though some will be set out at sea for you—or other players—to recover.\nA pirate's life for me\nSkull and Bones has had a long, and reportedly strenuous, development timeline. But today's reveal seems like it's confirming that Skull and Bones is doing what it originally set out to do: expand the sailing of Black Flag out into a full, multiplayer game. And I'm pretty intrigued. Building up a massive dreadnaught with cannons, armor, ballista, rockets, and a rowdy crew seems like an enjoyable time.\nWe'll see if Skull and Bones can bring it all home when it launches on November 8 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Stadia, Luna, PC via Epic, and Ubisoft Connect.\nThe post Skull and Bones locks in a launch date for this November appeared first on Destructoid.",

Today's gameplay trailer showed several first-person skirmishes, including RoboCop's iconic targeting system, and I hope Teyon goes all the way with the HUD elements.\nI'm not expecting glossy high-budget FPS action, but that's okay if they nail the little details. If this one's \"for the fans,\" that'll be fine. I hope it's widely enjoyable, though.\n\"You have the power to decide how to fulfill prime directives in your own way, but as the story unfolds proceed with caution because corruption and greed know no limit,\" according to the summary. It's also confirmed that RoboCop himself, Peter Weller, will return for \"voiceover work on the game.\" It's a check they needed to write, for sure.\nThe Steam page has a few more screenshots, including one with ED-209.\n\nRemember those directives\nI'm curious what kind of progression this game might have — how do you make RoboCop feel powerful without going overboard? To be honest, I wouldn't mind being totally OP. As the crime wave escalates, I'm sure OCP's heavy weaponry will come out in full force.\nRoboCop: Rogue City is in development for PC (Steam and the Epic Games Store), PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch.

The action will kick off in about 15 minutes' time and is expected to run for around an hour in length. You can check out the action in the stream below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwkTwMa3c-A\nNacon has been pretty forthcoming about the titles it will be spotlighting during the stream. We can expect new updates on robo-revolution title Steelrising, Lord of the Rings adventure Gollum, racers Test Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown and WRC Generations, and Games Workshop's ultra-violent sports sim Blood Bowl III. We will also be hearing about several new Xbox accessories in development in Nacon's hardware division, including the Daija Arcade Stick and the snazzy Pro Compact Colorlight controller.\nPerhaps the most intriguing title on the lineup is RoboCop: Rogue City, which was first revealed during last summer's Nacon Connect live stream. Developed by studio Teyon of Terminator: Resistance fame, we still know so little about Alex Murphy's latest jaunt into the digital realm. Though RoboCop, as a franchise, seems custom-designed for video games, the brand has always struggled to truly recreate the cinematic excellence of Paul Verhoeven's 1987 classic.\nWhile Teyon's Terminator title admittedly left something to be desired from a gameplay standpoint, it was clear that the studio does understand the potential buried within these enduring cinematic licenses. Fingers crossed that the developer will deliver the goods with RoboCop: Rogue City, and that we'll see some promising gameplay footage today.\nJoin us on Destructoid this lunchtime and we can see what's in store.

          "description": "The fine line between stupid and... and clever\nIn news spotted by GamesIndustry.biz, PlayStation will be removing certain purchased content from certain user accounts next month, citing \"evolving licensing agreements with content providers.\"\nThe content in question belongs to movie publisher Studio Canal, whose titles will be removed from the German and Austrian versions of PSN on August 31. Not only will this render some 100 films unavailable for purchase, but users who have previously purchased the affected content will also be unable to access the films once this date passes. You can check out the full list of affected films here — remember, this (currently) only affects German and Austrian PlayStation users.\nThe Studio Canal situation is an inevitable part of PlayStation's shuttering of PSN's movie rental/purchase market. While the discontinuation of film purchases came into effect in the spring of 2021, the continuing \"rolling over\" of licenses suggests that Sony will be forced to come to terms of closure with each and every studio that has offered its film and TV properties for purchase. Clearly the agreement between PlayStation and Studio Canal has come to an end.\nOf course, there are a lot of specificities here. We are, for now, only talking about purchased content involving one particular studio in two particular territories. But the prevailing concern is obviously focused more on the fact that publishers of any digital content — music, film, gaming, TV — have the essential right to remove and/or withhold access to any and all paid content at the drop of a hat.

Note that this is actually a collection of two games: Klonoa and Klonoa 2, which debuted in 1997 on PS1 and 2001 on PS2 respectively. Amid some spinoffs and a Wii remake in 2008, the series has remained dormant until the 25th anniversary of Reverie this year. Time on Frog Island, which debuts on July 12 on the eShop, is the other big game Nintendo is highlighting this week.\nThe eShop is full of smaller games, though!

Today, the two announced that E3 2023 will be organized with ReedPop's help.\nReedPop is the company behind PAX, New York Comic-Con, EGX, and the Star Wars Celebration. It's also the parent company of several gaming sites. including GamesIndustry.biz and Eurogamer. (Disclosure: I was previously employed by ReedPop at USgamer.)\nThe duo plans to host E3 2023 in the Los Angeles Convention Center again, during the second week of June 2023.\nhttps://twitter.com/E3/status/1545046476597956608\nThe event will host digital showcases and in-person components too, which will be open to consumers. Further details, like confirmed exhibitors, will be shared in the coming months.\n\"It is a tremendous honor and privilege for ReedPop to take on the responsibility of bringing E3 back in 2023,\" said ReedPop president Lance Festerman. \"With the support and endorsement of the ESA, we're going to build a world-class event to serve the global gaming industry in new and broader ways than we already do at ReedPop through our portfolio of world leading events and websites.\"\nA new union\nThis partnership is wild, but also makes sense. E3 has fully called off two shows since the outbreak of COVID-19, in 2020 and 2022. And in 2021, the ESA hosted a digital-only event. PAX dealt with some called-off shows too, but has been returning to the convention space with events like PAX East 2022 and the upcoming PAX West.\nMeanwhile, Geoff Keighley has been growing Summer Game Fest more each year. This year included both a stage show and an in-person event in Los Angeles. And, as the event republicized today, Summer Game Fest will be returning in June 2023 with both digital and in-person events. Looks like E3 will have some competition for its big return.\nThe post E3 is partnering with PAX organizer ReedPop for 2023 event appeared first on Destructoid.",

Their name is Let Me Solo Her: a user who logged in, fought the hardest boss in the game by themselves, and assisted others in getting a clear. They did it with such panache (the name, the outfit, the loadout, the tenacity) that they quickly became a meme (it's gotten to the point where they even have cosplay fans [image is semi-NSFW]) and now, they're being honored directly by the game's publisher, Bandai Namco, for their 1000th kill.\nLet Me Solo Her announced on Twitter that Bandai Namco US gifted them a special box with all sorts of goodies in it:\nA personalized letter\nWood art of the boss they took down and famously soloed\nA map of the game\nA long sword with the phrase \"rise, tarnished\" on it\nNote that this is the influencer bundle some folks got, but the personalized letter is unique. They didn't just tweet out photos of their care package though: over on Twitter, Let Me Solo Her actually shares their Souls story too, and it's pretty fascinating!\n\"I can still remember my first experience with the soulsborne series and almost quitting because of Iudex Gundyr in Dark souls 3. I'm glad I persisted and went on to enjoy the game, because this community is one of the most passionate and dedicated people I've ever seen in a game, and I'm proud to be a part of it.\"\n\nIn retrospect, Dark Souls 3 is a pretty fantastic place to start, with a lot of quality-of-life upgrades that newcomers would find helpful. Once they get over that hump (whether it's the first boss like Iudex Gundyr or the first few), they're generally on their way.\nhttps://twitter.com/TsuboiKlein/status/1544772979988520960\nThe post Elden Ring legend Let Me Solo Her gets real-life reward from publisher appeared first on Destructoid.",

Returning to its regular stomping ground of the Koelnmesse center in Cologne, Germany, Gamescom 2022 will offer attendees the opportunity to check out hundreds of upcoming releases on a multitude of platforms. Geoff Keighley will once again host an \"Opening Night Live\" stream to kick off the event.\nWhile Xbox will be appearing on the show floor, both PlayStation and Nintendo have already confirmed that they will not be hosting booths at this year's event. Since the pandemic shifted the balance of marketing mechanics, many publishers have chosen to highlight their products through their own channels, utilizing live streams and smaller, more localized events to demonstrate their upcoming releases.\nGamescom 2022 will take place in Cologne, Germany from August 24-28.

It's here that you can pause the game, and head to the \"amiibo\" portion of the system screen.\nIt's amazing that all these years on, there's a specific \"amiibo\" menu option front and center. I love how Monolith Soft calls it a \"little reward.\" You get a little treat for buying all that plastic!\n\nThe main Xenoblade Chronicles 3 amiibo is Shulk\nAs you may have seen via the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Direct, the sole core Xenoblade amiibo, Shulk, will unlock the biggest game-specific bit of content: the Monado sword skin.\nParty members who are using the swordfighter class are able to use the skin. You can find it via the \"characters -> clothing -> attachments\" submenu, which you'll unlock later in the game.\n\nOther amiibo, when scanned in Xenoblade Chronicles 3, will provide random items\nThe rest of the amiibo support isn't that exciting, which, as usual, is probably a good thing if you aren't a fan of the figures.\nScanning other amiibo will grant random items in \"collectible sets.\" These are usually groups of reagents or ingredients, like the ones listed above, fresh off of a scan from our copy of the game. Once scanned, they'll get dumped all over the ground, so you'll need to quit the menu and pick them up with your player character.\nNote that up to three amiibo can be scanned per day.

It's reminding me a bit of Triangle Strategy with its isometric view and shading.\n\nThe DioField Chronicle was first revealed during a Sony State of Play in March, alongside another Square Enix game Valkyrie Elysium. That new Valkyrie game has been locked in for a September 29 date for PlayStation platforms, with a PC launch coming later on November 11.\nIt looks like between those two games and the Crisis Core remaster, Square Enix has a good amount of games in store for the months ahead.\nThe post Strategy RPG The DioField Chronicle storms the field in September appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Fall Guys proves it has legs\nFall Guys has been one of the most successful online games over the past few years, and for good reason. After the flood of battle royale games we got, it was a nice change of pace to have one that was a colorful, goofy platformer that we could play with friends. I know I certainly got swept up in it when it first came out, and had a blast trying something new even if I was terrible. Now, Fall Guys is seeing even more success, and I couldn't be happier that a creative and genuinely fun idea is getting the love it deserves.\nThe official Fall Guys account tweeted this morning that the game has officially surpassed 50 million players! Exciting news for a game with such humble beginnings. If you're wondering why the game is just now garnering such a big player base, it's because Fall Guys just switched to a free-to-play model with battle passes and all that good stuff on June 21. The other significant change was that it moved off of Steam and onto the Epic Games Launcher, and was made available on Xbox and Nintendo Switch for the first time.\nhttps://twitter.com/FallGuysGame/status/1544698314242793473\nAfter the rerelease, Fall Guys garnered 20 million players in 48 hours, which is a pretty impressive feat for a game that's over two years old. Now it's more than doubled that after two weeks.\nIf nothing else, this scenario has proved that the free-to-play model can be pretty effective at getting players to try a new game, and because the outfits are such a fun part of Fall Guys, the battle pass system should work well for them. Here's hoping that the game continues to stick around for a while, because every time I see clips of it, it just makes me happy.\nI guess now is a better time than any to jump back on the train, and try to claim a crown of my own once and for all.\nThe post Fall Guys raced past 50 million players two weeks after going free-to-play appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Soleil-developed RPG will arrive on PlayStation platforms September 29, with a PC release to follow a little over a month later on November 11.\nThe latest release in the long-running Valkyrie/Valkyrie Profile series, Valkyrie Elysium will feature all of the deep adventure and Norse mythology that is the franchise's trademark. The plot sees the coming of Ragnarok, the cataclysmic event fated to destroy the world, the gods, and civilization itself. With the end times looming, the mighty Odin creates a sole emissary, Valkyrie, who stands as the final opposition to the collapse of the kingdom of the gods.\nhttps://youtu.be/XXG0xBnY_zo\nValkyrie Elysium will incorporate the series’ trademark \"Einherjar\" spirit battles, while adding all-new mechanics such as the \"Soul Chain\" combo system. As they embark upon their quest, players will be able to further customize their weaponry, gear, and abilities to access more powerful spirits, skills, and devastating \"Divine Arts.\" Valkyrie Elysium will retain the series' pedigree for beautiful and sweeping worlds, punctuated by an evocative score from series veteran composer Motoi Sakuraba.\nValkyrie Elysium will launch on PlayStation September 29, with PC (Steam) to follow on November 11. The PlayStation version of the Deluxe Digital Edition will also include a brand new port of the 1999 PSP release Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth.

According to information coming from Japan, Takahashi was found floating in shallow waters on the coast of Nago City on the Island of Okinawa by the country’s Coast Guard yesterday, July 6. He was wearing snorkeling gear when found by the Coast Guard. Both the Coast Guard and local police are investigating his death. \nTakahashi’s manga career began in 1982, but it didn’t truly take off until the release of Yu-Gi-Oh! in 1996. In between his start and Yu-Gi-Oh!, though, Takahashi published titles like Fighting Hawk and Tennenshoku Danji Buray, according to Kotaku. After Yu-Gi-Oh! hit shelves in 1996, the series only continued to grow in popularity, spawning a real-life card game in 1999 (that’s still extremely popular today) as well as multiple anime series. Today, the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise spans not just manga, card games, and anime, but video games as well, like this year’s Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel. \n[Source: NHK via IGN]\nThe staff at Game Informer extends their condolences to Takahashi’s family.",

Here’s what the official site has to say on the matter: \nThe Matrix Awakens was first announced and made available on the same night during the 2021 Game Awards. The Unreal Engine 5-powered demonstration from Epic Games stars Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss, who introduces the impressive graphics engine and how close to real-life its visuals can look. Awakens includes an on-rails car shootout throughout a city that often looks like it was ripped from the silver screen despite being rendered on the spot. The demo then lets you roam the massive pre-populated city and change things like time of day or traffic congestion to flex what UE5 is capable of. It’s a terrific showcase for the future of games, so if you haven’t given it a download yet, you’ll want to check it out before the delisting on Saturday.\nYou can watch us tour The Matrix Awakens in this episode of New Gameplay Today.",

          "description": "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is one of the most popular open-world fantasy RPGs ever made for several reasons, including its in-universe card game, Gwent. \nCD Projekt Red, the studio behind Wild Hunt and 2020’s Cyberpunk 2077, has already created a game based on Gwent, aptly called Gwent: The Witcher Card Game, but it seems the developer is not ready to leave that in-universe game behind just yet. That’s because the studio is launching Gwent: Rogue Mage, a new single-player roguelike deckbuilder, tomorrow. \nAnnounced by IGN, Gwent: Rogue Mage launches tomorrow, July 7, on PC, iOS, and Android. IGN reports that this game is what Project Golden Nekker, which the team revealed earlier this year, has turned into, and CD Projekt Red is marketing it as a single-player expansion to Gwent: The Witcher Card Game. However, you won’t need to own that because Rogue Mage is standalone. You can purchase the standalone version for $9.99 or the premium edition, which includes in-game skins and cosmetics, and card packs for the multiplayer portion of Gwent, for $19.99. \n“Rogue Mage came out of us noticing that years after The Witcher 3’s release, there are a significant number of players who want a more PvE experience from Gwent,” game director Vladimir Tortsov told IGN. “While Gwent multiplayer is a fantastic game for those who are looking for a great PvP multiplayer experience, we perfectly understand that many Witcher players loved the original mini-game of Gwent for totally different reasons. With Rogue Mage, we aim to give this audience a reason to play modern-day Gwent in the format they prefer.” \nIGN has an exclusive preview of Gwent: Rogue Mage after going hands-on with it ahead of tomorrow’s release, and if you’re looking for even more details about it, including what this single-player deckbuilder roguelike’s gameplay is like, be sure to check it out. \n[Source: IGN]\nAre you excited to check out Gwent: Rogue Mage?

Pre-ordering Valkyrie Elysium on PlayStation gets you the Alscir: Sword of the God of Light in-game item and a special themed avatar. The $74.99 Digital Deluxe Edition includes 72-hour early access, the Svartaljr: Sword of the Goddess of the Underworld in-game weapon, and a digital copy of Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth, the 2006 PSP port of the first Valkyrie Profile game. \nDon't worry, fans. Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth will also be sold separately on PS5/PS4 on September 29, so you don’t need to buy the Digital Deluxe Edition to play it. Additionally, after buying Elysium on PS4, you’ll also get access to the PS5 version. \nPre-ordering Valkyrie Elysium on Steam grants the 72-hour early access window and unique wallpapers. Its Digital Deluxe version also tosses in the Svartaljr: Sword of the Goddess of the Underworld. \nValkyrie Elysium will launch first on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on September 29. It then arrives on Steam on November 11.",

It describes the delay as a “strategic decision” and that we’ll learn more about the game in the near future. \nForspoken is no stranger to delays, as it was originally slated to arrive on May 24 before getting pushed to October 11. Though this second delay isn’t as long, it’s disappointing that we won’t get to experience Frey Holland’s adventure this year, but we trust that the delay will only help get the game up to snuff. The adventure drops Frey, a modern-day New Yorker, in the fantasy world of Athia where she acquires magical powers and a sentient talking bracelet. She’ll use her newfound abilities to free Athia from tyranny while also searching for a way back to her world. \nForspoken graced Game Informer’s cover in March, and you can catch up on a month’s worth of exclusive features and videos here.",

This 1994 Super Famicom RPG is from creator Takashi Tokita, one of the key developers behind Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy IV. While it would be fascinating to play through Tokita's original vision of Live a Live, we're getting an enhanced remake using the same HD-2D graphical style from the Octopath Traveler games.\nI recently spent roughly five hours in this ambitiously designed title, and can confidently say I enjoyed almost every second of its unique approach to storytelling and how it's brought to life through beautiful retro visuals. Square Enix is releasing Live a Live on Switch on July 22. Here are a handful reasons why you should put it on your radar:\nSeven Distinct Stories\nA Fun Assortment of Characters\nAdult Language and Humor?\nExcellent Writing\nCombat Has Depth...But Will We See It Enough?\n\n\nIt's Beautiful\nThe 2D-HD look is every bit as stunning as it is in Octopath Traveler. The backdrops in each story are a feast for the eyes. The sprite characters don't offer much animation but do move appropriately to convey an emotion or to highlight a dramatic sequence. The visuals scream of the 16-bit age, but also have modern touches everywhere, like realistic lighting of saloon doors swinging when the stranger strolls in to grab a drink.",

But like a person floating above the ground in the glow of an abducto beam, those moments aren’t connected to anything substantial; they just make some noise and get flung aside.\" The remake of the sequel modernizes more of the content.

Like Hyrule Warriors, which received a Breath of the Wild-specific sequel in Age of Calamity, this new Warriors game is set in the Fire Emblem: Three Houses universe. Three Hopes integrates the world, characters, and lore of the 2019 hit, and you can dive deeper into what I mean by that in my review. \nI interviewed Nintendo Co. Ltd. supervisor Genki Yokata, Intelligent Systems character designer and supervisor Toshiyuki Kusakihara, Team Ninja head and producer Yosuke Hayashi, and Koei Tecmo Games director Hayato Iwata to learn more about Three Hopes. We dove deep into the making of this new Musou, how the teams integrated Three Houses into it,…",

And now that the Beta is out on my preferred platform (Xbox), I've gotten the chance to sleep-dart and pulse-bomb my way through multiple game types, arenas, and heroes without the difficulties of mouse and keyboard controls. In other words, I'm confident that Overwatch 2 might not look like a completely different experience from its forebear, but it definitely plays like one.  \n\n\nIt is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture.

          "description": "Starting a cult isn’t easy work, but somebody’s got to do it in Massive Monster’s Cult of the Lamb, which hits consoles and PC next month. Fortunately, the team behind the devilishly cute game has released a new trailer with tips and tricks to start, and maintain, the best cult.\nThe first step is simple: grow your flock. All you need to do is fight through hordes of demon monsters to save innocent woodland creatures that will make for perfect initiates. Of course, you rename each addition and select other facets of their new life to dictate what kind of cult member (and worker) they’ll be for you.\nCheck it out in action: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, growing your flock is just the first step. You also need to satisfy the faithful. To do this, you must tend to your congregation by leading and feeding them and ultimately keeping them happy. You can give them gifts, invite them to feasts, and much more. The final step is to cleanse the non-believers, naturally. \nUnhappy cult members might lose faith in you, but this is fixable. You can opt to re-educate them in the ways of your cult, which will hopefully stop them from persuading other members to rise against you, or, if you just can’t see a solution, you can always sacrifice them to the gods. \nAnd there you have it – you’re ready to start a cult. For more, watch Game Informer’s exclusive Cult of the Lamb New Gameplay Today, which features never-before-seen gameplay, and then watch this new gameplay trailer that recently debuted during Summer Game Fest, which is where we learned Cult of the Lamb will come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on Aug. 11. \nAre you excited for Cult of the Lamb?

The idea of getting a demo this year is certainly enticing too, as Sea of Stars has looked phenomenal every time it’s made an appearance. \nThe game was first revealed in 2020 after a successful Kickstarter campaign and evokes JRPGs like Chrono Trigger, Illusion of Gaia, and Breath of Fire. It even features music contributions by Chrono Trigger composer Yasunori Mitsuda. Despite being a role-playing title, it serves as a prequel to 2018’s The Messenger, a Ninja Gaiden-inspired action game that was well-recieved (here’s our review).

In Pow Wow Entertainment's newly announced racer, Stuntfest: World Tour, I'm hoping the unique ejector-seat functionality is so jaw-droppingly incredible that it becomes the next craze. In the game's first trailer, we see drivers rocketing out of their cars to bounce off pads or ignite a jetpack's thrusters.\nStuntfest: World Tour is in development for PC with publishing duties handled by THQ Nordic sometime in 2022. We don't have many details yet, but a press release states that the player can assume the identity of a \"punker granny\" or a \"famous streamer\" with the hope of winning elimination-style stunt shows featuring 18 drivers. The competitions range from destruction derbies to glider racers. When the player hits the ejector button and their driver launches hundreds of meters into the air, they can be freely controlled and gadgets can be used to gain an edge. When descending, the next car you see can be yours to drive. Progress in the world tour rewards you with vehicle upgrades.\nStuntfest: World Tour has a hell of a hook, but it's difficult to figure out how these races will unfold. I can't wait to get my hands on this game to see if this unique gimmick (and the high levels of destruction) add up to something special.",

As EA notes, you cannot share your videos or screenshots from your play sessions.\nIf you are curious what Skate currently looks like or what you can expect from the gameplay, EA has released a trailer with the appropriate title \"Still working on it.\" The first few clips focus on bails, which must have been captured early in development given how rough the animations are. As the trailer moves on, the animations smooth out and the series' skating realism returns and is on display in a handful of awesome sequences. Full Circle also looks to be upping the scale of the challenges through some wild clips featuring impossible grind opportunities and huge ramps. Most of these clips are lack any kind of texturing or lighting and truly give us a look at how games are made.\nRegardless of where it is at in development, this trailer gives a fun look at a series that never should have left us.

Check out the short trailer below; it's as deliciously chaotic as you'd expect. \nThere was once a group of warriors who attempted to defeat the darkness.\n@FinalFantasy Origin's first expansion Trials of the Dragon King launches July 20th. pic.twitter.com/YvGEwGh1ux\nJune 30, 2022\nIn Stranger of Paradise fashion, it's hard to parse through what's happening in the footage, but we see Jack and co. cleaving their way through armored adversaries ranging from shield-holding knights to winged beasts with dazzling blades of their own. In one scene, a kingly figure sits upon a throne – is it safe to assume this is the Dragon King? – and says, \"You will die here, and I will live forever.\" We're sure Jack will make him eat his words. \nStranger of Paradise is as bizarre as Final Fantasy gets. Andrew Reiner gave the game a 7 out of 10 and concluded his review by saying, \"Stranger of Paradise is the strangest Final Fantasy game yet, bounding wildly between awful and fantastic. If you can tolerate Jack (and that's a big ask), the excellently crafted combat is worth a look. You may be coming to this game for the story and Final Fantasy experience, but it's all about combat and little else.\"\nStranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin's first DLC expansion, Trials of the Dragon King, drops on July 20 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

Join us on this fresh episode of New Gameplay Today as we check out the title's latest tank and show off the new map players can get their hands on later this year.\ncoverage here.\n\n\n\nThe Junker Queen is here, and she means business. The leader of the Junkers is more of an offensive tank than some of her other colleagues within the category. She comes strapped with a shotgun that maybe doesn't have the power of Roadhog's but has plenty of damage to dismantle the opposing team. She also comes equipped with a handy throwing knife that can cause quite the commotion. If players land a hit with an electrified weapon, enemy health drops over time. If she misses, the knife can still help as you can call it back, similar to the Leviathan Axe from God of War (2018), and actually pull enemies closer. Pair those abilities with her deadly charge up and a devastating ultimate attack, and she has a chance to really make some waves.\nOn top of a deep dive into Junker Queen and her moveset, we're also showing off the Push game type and Colleseo, a brand new map for Overwatch players to explore and dominate in. Is all this enough to get players to jump back into Overwatch? You'll just have to watch for yourself to find out!",

In fact, the series is going bigger. Much bigger!\n\n\nThe first trailer for Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher asks a crucial question, \"How would you like to raise your very own Ultra Kaiju?\" To which I responded, \"Yes, please. I'd very much like that. Give it to me now.\" Foregoing the dull, average-sized creatures you used to raise in Monster Rancher, Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher lets you take care of some colossal sweet boys. You'll raise the likes of Zettan, Gomora, and Alien Baltan – all licensed Kaiju from the Ultraman franchise. Many other existing Kaiju appear in the game, and you'll take them to help townsfolk in ways only a giant monster could. You can also participate in massive monster battles or watch the colossal beings waddle like big clumsy babies. As a fun bonus, the Kaiju can be bred, making wild combinations of their attributes appear in their children. It all seems like a lot of goofy fun.\nWe're not sure if Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher is coming to North America, but it's slated to hit Japan and Southeast Asia this year. At the very least, a version will be translated into English for those looking to import.",

In addition to dropping not one, not two, but three videos fleshing out the game's narrative, characters, and combat, we now know the JRPG launches in October. \nThe Divine Force arrives on October 27, exactly one year after it was first announced. The first trailer showcases the plot with a montage of out-of-context story clips that sets the tone for what's to come in the sci-fi action RPG. \n\n\nThe second video provides a more thorough walkthrough of Star Ocean's characters and combat. Players assume the role of one of two protagonists: Raymond Lawrence, a hot-headed merchant ship captain searching for his lost crew, and Laeticia Aucerius, a princess fighting to save her kingdom from destruction. The story unfolds differently depending on your chosen hero, and a ragtag party of allies accompanies each. The action-focused combat utilizes four party members players can swap between on the fly. You can battle in real-time or pause the action using Stop Mode to allow time to change tactics.  \n\n\nLastly, you watch the entire 8-minute opening cinematic for Raymond's campaign to see how the adventure kicks off for the young captain. \n\n\nTri-Ace promises to share more information in a future Mission Report video. Star Ocean The Divine Force will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",
