For a world with so much creativity packed into it, Game Freak regularly fails to include a provocative narrative to go along with its colorful monsters. No one – including myself – expects a Pokémon game to win a Nebula Award for Best Game Writing, but that doesn’t exempt them from producing something halfway intriguing, even if the series remains aimed at children. Fun characters, like smokeshow Professor Kukui from Pokémon Sun and Moon or fan-favorite goth girl Marnie from Pokémon Sword and Shield, certainly bring some life to each game, but for about a decade now the Pokémon tales have either been incredibly rushed or downright insulting to both children and adult fans alike.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It's been a colossal year in terms of the quantity and quality of software on all platforms. The mass layoffs we've seen across the industry in recent months are a worrying sign for anyone who cares about video games, not least for the creatives affected — all the developers and artists who crafted so many of the games we've enjoyed over the last 12 months. The breadth of experiences large and small that launched on Switch this year encapsulates not only what has made the console such a hit since 2017, but what can be accomplished when you invest in and nurture talented teams and people.\nHere at Nintendo Life, our soon-to-be-published, reader-governed Top 50 Switch Games of 2023 will showcase the finest examples on the console in a tried-and-true ranking, but as we did last year, we wanted to highlight the NL team's personal picks. Rather than tabulate the team's favourites in ranked form, NL staff submitted their five favourite Switch games of the year and we're presenting the collection below, in no particular order. We feel this gives smaller titles a chance to shine on a broader, non-ranked canvas.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "A promising new sprout.\nTwo years ago, a new developer called Singularity 6—comprised of various ex-Riot, Sony, and Blizzard staff—announced Palia, a “Massively Multiplayer Community Sim” that would aim to bring together the best parts of Stardew Valley and World of Warcraft. Since then, the title has been in early access on PC, and even though it’s still yet to arrive at its 1.0 release, a Switch version has arrived as part of the continued development. After spending some time with it, Palia shows a lot of promise, though it also notably still feels like an unfinished game.\nThe gameplay loop in Palia feels like it falls neatly between the grindiness of an MMO and the sedate pace of a farm sim. You engage in all the expected homesteading tasks, such as fishing, cooking, and tilling your field, to not just acquire gold to spend on some better furniture for your house, but also to progress an ongoing series of chained questlines from various NPCs that gradually lead you deeper into the world of Palia. You’re encouraged to take things at your own pace and engage in the activities that interest you, though fulfilling quests is usually the quickest way to secure yourself some ‘renown’ currency that can later be spent at a shrine to increase your focus meter. Focus is what you get when you eat food you cook for yourself, and this consumable resource will ensure that your labor will be rewarded with additional experience for as long as it lasts.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It was always fun to tear through the grubby guts of a Gothic industrial megacity with your chainsword, but it became repetitive and its whole loot-o-crafting mess sucked. A year on, the loot and crafting still suck, but I've really enjoyed the variety added by new levels and weapons and the polish from a year of tweaks and quality-of-life changes.

Games where any soldier can receive a horror mark, which attracts unspeakable phantoms from beyond reality to randomly attack them, and if they survive, they'll probably receive more horror marks. Games where I once deployed my entire military against an evil raven so large and powerful that I lost, leaving behind corpses that it fed on to grow even stronger. Games where a frog could, mathematically, kill god with one blow.\nDominions 6 is due out in January, bringing with it changes so esoteric that I'd be better off talking about Dominions 3 to Dominions 5 instead.

Seems far-fetched, but let's roll with it. \r\n\n\r\nAs a reminder, WOW now comes in two broad flavours: classic and modern. In modern World Of Warcraft, you can expect three more updates for the existing Dragonflight expansion before the release of World Of Warcraft: The War Within later in the year.

This makes it extremely agile for fast-paced games, and this is backed up by bulletproof Lightspeed wireless, a top optical sensor and excellent battery life too.

The Asus ROG Ally made a (mostly) successful attempt at slimming down while upping performance, and now we have the Lenovo Legion Go: an even higher-concept portable with Switch-style detachable controllers. One of which transforms into a mouse. It’s a bit mad but I’ve always loved the concept’s ambition, even as I rendered working protypes a little less... working.\nI’m happy to report that this, the Legion Go’s retail version, is far more resistant to such improprieties. Moreover, it’s basically the best Windows handheld out there right now – though some occasional fiddliness, and the looming issue of the Steam Deck OLED, mean it isn’t necessarily the finest palmable PC outright.\nRead more",

If you're unfamiliar with it, it's about a girl named Anna who must escape from a mysterious island, but the whole game is presented like you're reading a book - only one that you can click on and prod with your fingers to reveal new puzzles within that text. It's very clever, especially when it occasionally asks you to rotate your device to navigate parts of its game worlds - there's an excellent bit with stairs that I won't spoil, but seriously, if you haven't played Device 6 and you own an iOS device, go and download it now. \nOnce you've done that, you should also have a look this year's Delete After Reading, which does a very good impression of it for us folks on PC, hiding smart, tactile text puzzles inside its interactive spy thriller. \nRead more",

Announced in the dusty days of 2018 as a multiplayer mode for The Last Of Us: Part 2, it evolved into a standalone experience with new characters and a new setting, but Sony reportedly scaled the project back earlier this year. Naughty Dog have now formally called it quits, stating that supporting a live service project such as this would have “severely impacted” future single-player game projects. Sony never locked down platforms for The Last Of Us Online, but a PC release was surely on the cards, though I would have expected the game to launch first on PlayStation, as with the original Last Of Us and Uncharted 4.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It seems particularly interesting today in light of the recent resurgence of Doom-style shooters, often known as \"boomer shooters\" because of their deliberately retro style and singular focus on shootin' stuff and bein' cool, much like Doom. And then the obvious solution was to just ask the devs making these games about what they think of Doom and its impact on their work.\nI reached out to developers who've worked on Turbo Overkill, Prodeus, Forgive Me Father (and Forgive Me Father 2) and almost the whole stable working at New Blood Interactive to ask them some annoyingly specific questions about Doom in the hope of getting the sort of idiosyncratic answers you get from interesting devs - and they delivered! In fact, they delivered in such quantity and quality that I've elected to just present their answers to you, rather than try to weave them together as if we were all sitting together at dinner exchanging bon mots, both for clarity and to include as much as possible in their own words. It's a fascinating and entertaining collection of thoughts.\nRead more",

I've played just a handful - certainly, far from enough to pronounce myself any kind of expert - but I do feel like I've played one of the best in the shape of Siren, a Doom II total conversion from Dithered Output, the first episode of which can be downloaded free from Itch.io.\r\n\n\r\nThe mod's overall vibe is encapsulated, I think, by the sentient vending machine you meet a short way in, just round the corner from a rec room that contains a disembodied head on tentacles, and down the corridor from a tiered canteen full of ghouls and unsympathetic men with shotguns. You ask the machine if it has any clue what's going on. It tells you that its job is to keep its mouth shut and dispense soda. Can I have a soda, then? \"No.\"\r\n\n \nRead more",

That might seem like an odd thing to say about your own company's activities. But when you look at what Nightdive have done in the last twelve months, it's less surprising. In March, Nightdive announced they were being acquired by Atari in a deal worth $10 million. In May, they released their long-anticipated remake of System Shock, in development for eight years. July brought Rise Of The Triad: Ludicrous Edition, while August saw the release of Quake 2 Remastered, and a remaster of Turok 3 arrived at the end of November. Nightdive are currently working on an overhaul of Star Wars: Dark Forces, due out in 2024. \r\n\n\r\nIn short, it's been a busy year for the remastering maestros. In the wider context of 2023, which has been simultaneously a banner games and a deeply worrying year for the people making them, I wanted to know how Nightdive view the last twelve months, and what the audience response to these projects means for the studio's future.\r\n\n \nRead more",

As a player, you're excited by the prospect of the game to come - the sights you'll see, the challenges you'll face - and first impressions can make or break your entire perception of what a game is versus the one you had stored in your head before switching it on. For video game creators, however, a new beginning is often racked with questions. What, exactly, do you choose to show players first? How will you introduce them to something they've never seen before? And if that game is successful, how do you keep reinventing that first impression across what could be several decades? \nIn revisiting every mainline Doom game to celebrate its 30th anniversary this month, it's clear that even id's iconic shooter has wrestled with how to answer these question, and the ways it's tried to reinvent itself over the years paints a captivating portrait of a series trying to move with the times. Nowhere is this more apparent than in its opening levels. Played in close succession, crushing 30 years into not even quite three hours, what emerges isn't just the evolution of one of the all-time great PC games, but also a potted history of the FPS. So join me as we chart Doom's rise, fall and rebirth through the lens of its first stages.\nRead more",

With dread, I'm often met with the accursed exclamation, \"You've not played insert game before?\" followed by a good dose of judgment. But what do you do when you need to play through a backlog of games all while keeping up-to-date with new releases for work? With games now stretching out at 100+ hours apiece, where is the time for old classics like Doom?\nFor me, approaching Doom was cathartic. Playing a game that's older than myself was certainly an experience, but I was shocked at how well it holds up. \nRead more",

          "description": "Othercide from French developer Lightbulb Crew is one of my favourite recent tactics RPGs. It's an atmospheric and rewardingly meticulous experience that typically pits you against overwhelming numbers, where victory comes about by carefully exploiting reaction abilities, positioning your troop of weary warriors just-so, and manipulating the initiative bar. At times, for me, it's up there with Into The Breach.\nBut I do acknowledge that it's an acquired taste, not least because the narrative and extra-dimensional setting are relentlessly unpleasant - a terrible soup of mother metaphors and Penny Dreadful imagery, in which you pit clones against Silent Hill monsters, then liquefy the survivors to spawn new characters. What's the appropriate way to follow up a game like that? Ah yes, with an episodic dating sim.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Back in May when I first played Ubisoft's new Metroid-like Prince Of Persia game, The Lost Crown, ahead of its reveal at this year's Summer Game Fest, I got to sample several hours' worth of some of the early areas inside its cursed mountaintop citadel of Mount Qaf. Some of protagonist Sargon's powers had been unlocked early to give us a taste of his abilities, and on the whole, I had an exceedingly good time with it. One thing was missing though, and that was any kind of narrative framing for why Sargon was here in the first place. Sure, we'd been told ahead of time that Sargon's main mission in The Lost Crown is tracking down and saving the eponymous Prince of this game, but I didn't actually see any of this in action. Anything with the slightest whiff of story about it had been expertly excised from that initial demo build, and I was left none the wiser about how those opening hours of The Lost Crown would really play out in the final game.\nNow, I've been able to play the game from the beginning, with all the story bits slotted back in and Sargon's powers unlocked in the correct order. You may have got a glimpse of some of that stuff in the new trailer released during last week's Game Awards. In the space of two minutes, it sets the scene for Sargon's rescue mission by first introducing all of his fellow warrior mates, and then seconds later showing how they're all at each other's throats as they get increasingly turned around in Mount Qaf's labyrinth. And oh my, I can practically feel all the inevitable backstabbing from here. It's going to be delicious, I can tell, and I can't wait to slice them all six ways to Sunday when The Lost Crown comes out in January.\nRead more",

Where blocking - aka holding a button to avoid damage - is a concession to the tedious attritional undertow of many action games, parrying - aka pressing a button on cue to cancel damage and often, prep a counter - is the act of cutting through the bullshit. It passively reduces any and all visual and thematic overwhelm the game would have you experience to a question of timing. \r\n\n\r\nIn the face of a good parry mechanic, the grandest of bosses are equivalent to rank-and-file mobs. You're a monster the size of a building? You're the demonic manifestation of a protagonist's mother issues? You're capitalism incarnate? You're wielding eight chainsaws at once? Ehhh. I'm not just going to survive your onslaught. I'm going to dismiss it. All of it: your absurd DPS, your multiple elemental modifiers, your screen-blanketing special effects, your overcooked core concept, the very laws of physics - poof, gone, as though they had never been. Blocking is akin to maintaining a poker face while you're being harangued by your boss over Zoom. Parrying is politely pointing out that your boss has left his camera on, and that he should probably wear trousers when he's at work. It is \"nope\" said so quietly that it shuts everything else up. \r\n \nRead more",

This book contains scenes of graphic violence!\" These are the words that adorn the Doom comic book, which was originally released for promotional purposes during 1996's E3 by GT Interactive and Marvel Comics. \"Knee-deep in the dead!\" is the next bit of text below the logo, referencing the name of the first shareware Doom episode and beautifully describing the blood-soaked cover illustration by Tom Grindberg, who was apparently tickled enough at the thought of drawing this monstrosity to take time away from working on 2000 AD.\nThe cover is an accurate peek at the gore and demonic entrails that lie within this epic work of sequential storytelling, which required the writing skills of not one, but two gentlemen - Steve \"Body Bag\" Behling and Michael \"Splatter\" Stewart. Both Behling and Stewart have a decent body of work between them at Marvel, where they've penned more civilised fare starring the likes of Ant-Man and The Hulk. The Doom comic, in comparison, seems to have been a thing that was written in a fever dream, and DoomWorld, which lovingly hosts scans of this brisk read to this day, describes it appropriately: \"Some time in 1996 a couple of guys got together and smoked what was apparently a large amount of crack and then injected pure heroin into their eyes and then proceeded to create what is now known only as 'the Doom comic.'\"\nRead more",

          "description": "Legendary-tier monster cards on the table time: I do not like video game loot. I think that the popularity of \"looting\", an English word itself looted from Hindi during the time of the East India Company, is one of the worst aspects of the modern games industry and especially of the blockbuster live service game, which strives to keep its audience coming back by means of fresh loot injections at regular intervals.\nI distrust how the randomisation element of much video game looting flirts with actual gambling mechanics. I hate that structuring games around the acquisition of loot creates a framework and an appetite for microtransactions and arguably, NFTs. But I am kind of fascinated by the art of designing loot, and especially when it comes to action RPGs such as Diablo 4 and Path Of Exile 2, because it seems to trade on some irresolvable contradictions.\nRead more",

          "description": "There's just a couple of winners left to announce as Destructoid's GOTY awards wrap up for the year, and that includes our staff pick for the Best PC Game of 2023.\n\n\nThis year offered a healthy spread of genres, and studios big and small wound up making our cut. Some of our favorite indies that didn't wind up competing for that genre's award wound up here, as Slay the Princess, Cocoon, and BattleBit Remastered compete for a spot among PC greats.\n\n\nStarfield is competing here too  — there's no reality in which I'm playing that on consoles without mods, and it seems a lot of us are in the same boat. There's also Baldur's Gate 3, Dave the Diver, and Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty on our nominees list, but Larian's brain tadpoles ultimately win here. \n\n\n\n\n\nThat is to say, Baldur's Gate 3 is Destructoid's Best PC Game of 2023. It's one of the games that, even in a year of heavy hitters, stands out as a must-play. \n\n\nOur review, handled by senior editor Eric Van Allen, echoes many of my own sentiments about the RPG as he praises its storytelling, visual scale, and strategic combat. I've spent more than my fair share of time troubleshooting it, especially into Act 3. But that I can still enjoy it this much this speaks to the quality of both what's already there and the continued update support from Larian. Even at its ugliest, Baldur's Gate 3 is a gem. \n\n\nI'm stuck in a constant loop replaying BG3, so it'll probably wind up my pick for 2024, 2025, and so on. The romances are just too good, and when I'm not poking around in Faerun, I'm busy modding it. Either way, thanks to the folks at Larian for pulling this together. It's a special game with a development tale I'm endlessly curious about, and I'm not sure if I'll ever play another like it.\n\n\n\nDestructoid’s Best PC Games of 2023, nominees:\n\n\n\nBaldur’s Gate 3\n\n\nStarfield\n\n\nCocoon\n\n\nSlay the Princess\n\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty\n\n\nBattleBit Remastered\n\n\nDave the Diver\n\n\n\n\nThe post Destructoid’s award for Best PC Game of 2023 goes to… appeared first on Destructoid.",

It is estimated that attacks on Uber, Nvidia, and Rockstar have cost the companies up to $10 million. Per the BBC, Kurtaj expressed apparent unwillingness to stop conducting similar attacks. \n\n\nIt turns out that by the time he committed the GTA 6 hack, Kurtaj was already on bail for hacking Nvidia and BT/EE. The BBC reports: \"Despite having his laptop confiscated, Kurtaj managed to breach Rockstar, the company behind GTA, using an Amazon Firestick, his hotel TV and a mobile phone.\"\n\n\nKurtaj and another unnamed member of the Lapsus$ hacking group are the first to be convicted, while others are thought to remain at large, according to the BBC.\n\n\nIn July, Arion Kurtaj was deemed unfit to stand trial following a diagnosis of acute austism. The court then had the jury focusing not on whether Kurtaj had done it with criminal intent, but solely on whether or not he had perpetrated the alleged crimes at all.\n\n\nRegarding the mediate fate of Kurtaj, BBC reports: \"He will remain at a secure hospital for life unless doctors deem him no longer a danger.\"\n\n\nThe news arrives just a few days after news broke of a massive hack at Insomniac, leaking details about in-development games and information about the studio.\n\nThe post GTA 6 hacker indefinitely sentenced to a secure hospital appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Did you know that D4 Enterprise is releasing Japanese PC-88 games on Switch? It hasn’t been going on for long, but I just learned it now, thanks to Hydlide. D4 has added two titles to their EggConsole lineup, with 1984’s Hydlide and 1986’s Silpheed.\n\n\nThe PC-88 is a Japanese home computer, similar to the Commodore 64 or Apple II. While we never got it over here in the West, it was extremely popular in its home country. Because of this, there are very few ways for Anglophones to really experience them. The fact that someone is porting games from the platform to Switch is pretty exciting to retro explorers such as myself.\n\n\nHydlide is an interesting, but kind of dopey, game that was ported to the NES but originally released on the PC8801. It’s an action RPG that predates both Dragon Quest and The Legend of Zelda. It’s a pioneer! Though, it’s also not a great one. Still worth experiencing for the historical context and its overall importance in the genre. It's the same reason you might play the original Ultima.\n\n\nImage via Nintendo\n\n\nSilpheed, on the other hand, is a scrolling shoot-‘em-up. For 1986, it feels so ahead of its time. It uses a lot of 3D effects and has some pretty rocking music. It was ported to other microcomputers at the time, got a semi-sequel on the Sega CD, and lived on through entries on the PS2 and Xbox 360.\n\n\nBeyond these two games, you can also find Xanadu, Relics, and Thexder already available as part of the EggConsole series. Each one runs for $6.49, which strikes me as a good price. The only thing to note is that parts of these games are still in Japanese, but it appears that all of the important stuff is in English.\n\nThe post Two new EggConsole PC-8801 games hit Switch today, Silpheed and Hydlide appeared first on Destructoid.",

At first, I was just impressed with how magnificent and sprawling the sky islands were. By the time I had brute-forced puzzles with unique object manipulation mechanics and discovered the depths of the underground, I was completely enamored.\n\n\nBreath of the Wild managed to sing a similar song back in 2017, but this felt considerably different. That's worth talking about because at first, some were worried that Tears of the Kingdom would crib way too much from Breath of the Wild.

This infamy has been underlined further still with Patch 14, which features Layer 7 of Hell itself.\n\n\nUltrakill is set in a post-apocalypse where human blood is the only currency that matters anymore, as it fuels the few robots that remain. Given this premise, it's to be expected that the game's narrative and level design would take some weird turns, but the seventh layer of Hell is particularly noteworthy.

Now, after several years, not only has a new version been released, but it's caused the concurrent player count to spike to an all-time high.\n\n\nAccording to recent data from SteamDB, Geometry Dash reached a peak of 88,346 on December 20. If you look at the graph, you can see how it shot up in the space of a couple of hours, with the previous count showing just under 13,000 players.\n\n\n\n\nProgress on update 2.2 has been a long time coming. In fact, the last update from developer RobTop Games was in October, which said that the proposed November release would \"not be doable.\" Now that it's finally out, we can see just how much people have been waiting for it.\n\n\nBouncy bouncy\n\n\nFor those who haven't experienced it, Geometry Dash has you moving through levels of varying difficulties, playing as a simple shape or other object. Jumping over obstacles to get to the end, the game's genius comes from the fact that the level moves along in time to the music.\n\n\nThis necessitates well-timed presses in order to hop over spikes and gaps or wind your way through tight corridors. While I don't want to draw too big a comparison, if you liked the nature of Flappy Bird, this could be right up your alley.\n\n\nAt the time of writing, more than 59,000 people are playing, which kind of shows that the wait can sometimes be worth it in the end.\n\nThe post Years later, rhythm game Geometry Dash smashes its player peak appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "No judgements here, but if you're a little embarrassed about some of the games in your library, there's now a solution. Not long ago, it was rumored that Steam would allow you to hide titles from others, and now that reality has come to fruition.\n\n\nIn the most recent update to the Steam client, it's now possible to mark your games as private. A post on Steam says there are \"times when you might want to keep a few of the games you own\" a hidden secret from others. For whatever reason you have.\n\n\n\n\nAs such, any games you now deem it appropriate to make private can be hidden from anyone who isn't you. This includes: \"your ownership, in-game status, playtime, and activity in that game.\" There's an FAQ that tells you how to go about doing this.\n\n\nIt begins at the checkout\n\n\nThe Steam patch also brings with it some updates to the shopping cart. Two new features have been added, which are:\n\n\n\nInline gifting - just in time for the holidays, you can now purchase gifts for multiple friends (and yourself) without having to make multiple purchases. Plus, gift messaging has been simplified to speed up the checkout process.\n\n\nOne cart across all devices - items in your shopping cart will now follow you across all devices where you're signed in to Steam. Note that during the beta, the cart will only be accessible within the beta client.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it also takes into account the new game privacy settings, by allowing you to hide them at the point of purchase.\n\n\nLook, I'm not going to go into any details here. We all know why Steam would allow users to not advertise some of the things in their games list. We'll just acknowledge that this is now something many will find useful and we'll move on with our lives.\n\nThe post Steam now allows you to hide your shame by marking games as private appeared first on Destructoid.",

During that time, it’s racked up a 90% positive rating on Steam. In a world where some games seem to be perpetual Early Access titles, It may seem like a short time for a game to be in that state. However, it seems to be right on track with what the developer was aiming for, allowing them to incorporate player feedback and add new features before launch.\n\n\n\n\nBlazBlue Entropy Effect is a side-scrolling roguelite similar to Dead Cells. The emphasis is on fancy, flashy combos, with lots of customization. I’m not super familiar with BlazBlue as a fighting series, but apparently, that’s not a problem. According to the store page (and also Steam reviews), the connection is largely an aesthetic one. It doesn’t tie its story or world into the established canon. It doesn’t seem to have anything to do with the lore. Weird choice, but it sounds like it works.\n\n\nBlazBlue Entropy Effect is currently available in Early Access.

According to The Verge, Instead of appointing a new replacement, the top Activision Blizzard executives will now report to Microsoft's game content and studios president Matt Booty. Several more higher-level Activision Blizzard employees will also leave the company in the new year with departures planned through March 2024.\n\n\nA lot of changes up top\n\n\nIt looks like the ripple effects of Microsoft acquiring Activision Blizzard will really go into full effect in the new year. In an internal memo, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer highlighted some of the changes including the departure of Lulu Meservey at the end of January and Humam Sakhini at the end of December. In March, Vice Chariman of Activision Blizzard Thomas Tippl will leave the company as well as Chief Administrative Officer Brian Bulatao, Chief People Officer Julie Hodges, Chief Legal Officer Grant Dixton, and CFO Armin Zerza.\n\n\nEnd of an era\n\n\nAfter 32 years with the company, Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick's reign comes to an end. His resignation comes just two months after the acquisition of the company by Microsoft. After joining Activision in 1991, Kotick was responsible for several larger acquisitions in the industry including the Vivendi Games merger in 2008 that created Activision Blizzard and the acquisition of mobile game developer King.\n\n\nHowever, it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows with Kotick.

Takeyasu's company Crim purchased the rights a couple years after launch, and now the HD remaster finally has an April 28, 2024 date for Nintendo Switch. \n\n\nCrim announced the date for the port along with publisher Rainy Frog. El Shaddai will hit Switch both physically and digitally in Japan, including a physical deluxe edition priced at ¥8,250 (about US$57). Paying a little extra nets you the game along with a drama CD that comes with a script. Whether this is your first time ascending or you've been looking for an excuse to do so again, you can see more in the release date trailer. \n\n\n\n\nEl Shaddai made its debut in 2011 to somewhat mixed reactions. It's a uniquely stylized action game that isn't necessarily going to be for everyone, but those who vibe with it are probably still thinking about it today. It had a pretty big promotional and crossover push at the time, including one that saw Japanese clothing brand Edwin release some pricey 503 Zero jeans in both Enoch and Lucifel styles. Unfortunately, none of the Switch releases come with themed clothing, so you'll have to hit eBay for a gently used pair. \n\n\nOutside of the bonuses included with the Japanese physical editions, it doesn't seem as if there's much in the way of new content here. If good ol' reliable El Shaddai—complete with its rock, paper, scissors combat and blend of 3D and 2D sections—sounds like a solid enough hook in 2024, mark your calendars for April. \n\nThe post El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron HD Remaster makes Switch debut in April 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Whether you love it or hate it, Starfield is one of 2023's most notable releases. For all the things that it does well, there's loads of stuff that Bethesda could improve upon, too. It sounds like improvements should be coming in 2024, though, according to the company's latest announcement.\n\n\nWork on the company's latest flagship appears to continue in the background. Many of its most pressing improvements have already been outlined in the days and weeks prior, but a few more precious details have just been provided, suggesting what else might be coming.\n\n\n\n\nWhile Bethesda's already confirmed some of the stuff that's coming to Starfield in 2024, such as new travel options, city maps, and a rough update cadence, there are some curious new tidbits present here. Specifically, the following:\n\n\n\nNew ship customization options.\n\n\nNew gameplay options that allow further difficulty adjustments.\n\n\n\nBethesda's not provided any detailed information on whether the team intends to simply add new customizations and difficulty sliders, or go all-in on the concept. A survival mode such as the one featured in Fallout 4 is something that players have expressed interest in, for example.\n\n\nBethesda's plans for Starfield in 2024\n\n\nFurther, Bethesda's previously confirmed update cadence, with new patches coming in every six weeks or so, won't be kicking in before February. This suggests that there's nothing new coming to Starfield in the next two months or so.\n\n\nOf course, Starfield's first confirmed expansion pack, Shattered Space, is still on the way. No date has been set for that yet, but the post says it's part of the 2024 plan.\n\n\nBethesda's end-of-year post outlining the near future of Starfield development could, therefore, either be taken with a dose of skepticism or hype, depending on one's opinion of what's already there. Things really could go either way for Starfield's post-launch support.\n\nThe post Bethesda aims to update Starfield roughly every six weeks in 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

You have 24 hours to claim it.\n\n\nI’ve heard of DNF Duel but know next to nothing about it. There was a lot of PR stuff coming at us in the lead-up and some excitement around the launch, but I think the fighting game market is pretty jammed up with heavy hitters to the point where it maybe didn’t catch fire. It’s a tough market for newcomers. It’s a spin-off of Dungeon & Fighter, which I also don’t know a whole lot about.\n\n\n\n\nWhen I hear the acronym “DNF,” my mind first goes to “did not finish,” and then afterward goes to “Duke Nukem Forever.”\n\n\nI do know something about the Epic Games Store. It gives away a lot of free games and doesn’t make any money for Epic. I installed it for Ghostbusters Spirits Unleashed and uninstalled it once that game came to Steam.\n\n\nDNF Duel does seem like a good time, though. You certainly can’t argue with the price of free. However, you’ll have to act now-ish, since the sale is only for 24 hours.

Which makes sense! It’s an epilogue, after all, so it would be easy to spoil things about the ending. Speaking of which, here are the requirements to access the new epilogue content:\n\n\n-Complete a certain postgame event in Pokémon Scarlet or Pokémon Violet.\n\n\n-Complete the main stories of The Teal Mask and The Indigo Disk.\n\n\n\n\nThe post suggests that the epilogue takes place in Kitakami and it’s a “new adventure,” but not much besides that.\n\n\nAs I said, I didn’t play any of the DLC. Timothy “Windchime” Monbleau did just recently and sounded like he had the last vestiges of optimism forcibly sucked from his soul. I welcome him to the void. There is plenty of room. I really don’t know how else to describe his critique of the expansion. If you want to know what it looks like when the lights go out in a human heart, it's a worthwhile read.\n\n\nHowever, if you have different thoughts on The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero, you might appreciate having the story tied up in a bow. Heck, maybe Mr. Monbleau will feel better about his agonizing experience with BBQs once it’s all wrapped up. Who can say?\n\n\nWhat I do know is that the epilogue of The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero will be released on January 11, 2024. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are available on Switch.

          "description": "Developer Eyeguys and publisher Santa Ragione released the \"treacherous visual novel\" Mediterranea Inferno on PC in August 2023, and now it has a date for consoles. The latest announcement has the game hitting PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on March 5, 2024.\n\n\nMediterranea Inferno follows the act of Eyeguys' 2020 visual novel Milky Way Prince: The Vampire Star, which tackled similarly weighty themes. You can see some of its idiosyncrasies on display in the console announcement and launch date trailer below.\n\n\n\n\nThe story of Mediterranea Inferno kicks off as three young 20-something guys reconnect after a period of isolation that's all too familiar. This is a post-pandemic yarn that reflects collective trauma through the trio of Claudio, Andrea, and Mida, who are attempting to enjoy their Southern Italy retreat. \n\n\nAlong the way you'll get to choose what they do each day, from visiting the local cemetery to relaxing by the pool, soaking in an endless summer that paves the way for insight into their psyches and unlocks hidden fears, obsessions, and the reality of dashed ambitions. \n\n\nComing to grips with inner demons is an inevitable side effect of rediscovery in Mediterranea Inferno, apparently. Creator Lorenzo Redaelli produced hundreds of illustrations for the game along with handling the writing and music, so much like Milky Way Prince, there's a very personal touch behind it all. We have a little ways to go before that March console launch approaches, but in the meantime Mediterranea Inferno is available via Steam and Epic Games Store. \n\nThe post Mediterranea Inferno visual novel sets console debut for March 5, 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Over 50 million units have been sold through consumers just over three years since the console launched back in November 2020. According to Sony, the console experienced strong sales momentum this year due to the release of popular games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Achieving this PS5 sales milestone is a testament to the unwavering support of the global PlayStation community and their passion for the incredible experiences created by the talented developers from PlayStation Studios and our partners. We’re grateful for all of our players who have joined the PS5 journey so far, and we’re thrilled that this is the first holiday season since launch that we have a full supply of PS5 consoles – so anyone who wants to get one can get one.\"\n-Jim Ryan, President and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment\n\n\n\nThe milestone puts the PlayStation 5 console at the 15th best-selling gaming console of all time if you go purely by units sold. This puts it just above the SNES which sold a little over 49 million and behind the Xbox One which has sold about 58 million units since its release in 2013. For comparison, the best-selling console of all time is the PlayStation 2 which sold over 155 million units in its lifetime.\n\nThe post PlayStation 5 surpasses 50 million units sold appeared first on Destructoid.",

In StarRupture, players will build up their base on an alien planet stuck in a catastrophic cycle of destruction by a nearby star.\n\n\n\n\nBase-building meets tower defense\n\n\nPlayers take on the role of a convict exiled from Earth with a sentence of mining and expanding industrial production while researching new technology on a hospitable but hostile new planet. As players build up their base with complex machinery, they will also need to fight waves of hostile enemy monsters. StarRupture can be played solo or cooperatively with up to four players.\n\n\n\n\"We wanted to come up with a new title that more accurately described the dangerous sci-fi world we’re creating. We had to break away from the mythology-based roots of Chimera and we landed on StarRupture. Originating from the base word ‘rupture’—as in a break or a disturbance—the new name also closely ties to the name of the planet’s star which is aptly named, Ruptura.\n-Krzysztof Kwiatek, Founder and CEO of Creepy Jar\n\n\n\nThere's no release timeframe for StarRupture yet, but developer Creepy Jarp plans to continue releasing devlogs in the coming months as development progresses.\n\nThe post Green Hell developer Creepy Jar reveals new sci-fi base builder StarRupture appeared first on Destructoid.",

Certainly, it wasn’t the first social deduction game, but in the wake of its success, there was an explosion of them. Some of them are just blatant carbon copies.\n\n\nNow, these two runaway successes are colliding in Vampire Survivors: Emergency Meeting.

          "description": "After a steady stream of leaks following the game's “closed alpha tech test” in late November, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League developer Rocksteady has issued an official statement urging players to “avoid spoilers where they can.”\n\n\nRocksteady addressed the situation via their Twitter account, writing that “it is very disappointing to see details being shared” and asking players to avoid them until the game officially releases on February 2. Check out the full statement down below:\n\n\n\n\nEven though the alpha test that ran from November 30 to December 3 only featured a small part of the campaign to test online infrastructure, some plot details found their way online. Several details, including several well-known characters from the DC ensemble who’re making an appearance in the game and more, have reportedly been leaked online.\n\n\nThis isn't the first time details about Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League have surfaced on the internet against the dev's wishes. An earlier leak this year involved the game's online features and battle pass. Suffice it to say, that didn't garner a whole lot of positive reception for Rocksteady.\n\n\nWarner Bros. is issuing copyright strikes to pull the images that are circulating, but if you want to avoid spoilers absolutely, you may need to mute the social media pages related to this game, or the Suicide Squad and Justice League in general, for the time being.\n\n\nIn fact, I’d avoid reading the replies to that Rocksteady tweet too. I certainly regret not doing so now.\n\nThe post Rocksteady acknowledges Suicide Squad leaks, asks players to not post spoilers appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Sony has announced that the PlayStation 5 has hit a sales milestone of over 50 million units. It achieved this milestone just over three years into its life cycle.\nSince the console’s launch in November 2020, over 50 million consoles have been purchased as of December 9, 2023, according to a press release. In July, Sony announced the PS5 had sold over 40 million units, meaning that roughly 10 million more consoles were sold in just the last 4 to 5 months.\n\n\nThe holiday season is likely a big contributor to this bump. Additionally, the October release of the much-anticipated PS5 exclusive Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 (now the fastest-selling PS Studios game ever) undoubtedly drove players to pick up the console. \nThe milestone is a nice way to cap off a busy 2023 for Sony. It launched new hardware with PlayStation VR2, the PlayStation Portal, and a smaller redesigned PS5. It also boasted marquee third-party exclusives such as Final Fantasy XVI and, for a few months, was the sole console home of the critically acclaimed Baldur’s Gate 3. \nIt’ll be interesting to see how the console’s momentum fares going into 2024. So far, Sony’s first-party output consists of The Last of Us Part II Remastered arriving in January. Announced third-party exclusives include Final Fantasy VII Rebirth in February (GI’s latest cover story) and Team Ninja’s Rise of the Rōnin in March.

It posted images to prove the validity of its claim, demanding 50 bitcoin – roughly $2 million – from Sony within seven days or it would leak what it had discovered, as reported by CyberDaily. Sony did not comply with the demand and now the group has released more than a terabyte of hacked data pertaining to Insomniac Games. \nThe total leak comprises more than 1.3 million files, for a total of 1.67 terabytes of data, according to VideoGamesChronicle via CyberDaily. The leaked data includes information about Marvel's Spider-Man, future Insomniac Games titles, release schedules, and private employee information like tax and employment forms, internal studio messages, and more. Game Informer will not be disclosing any of the hacked information. \nCyberDaily reached out to Rhysida and learned the ransomware group specifically targeted Insomniac Games. \"Yes, we knew who we were attacking,\" a Rhysida spokesperson told the publication over email. The group also told CyberDaily its motivation for the hack was financial. \nInsomniac Games just released Marvel's Spider-Man 2, which we loved – you can read about why in Game Informer's review here. The studio revealed Marvel's Wolverine back in 2021, revealing this year that the game takes place in the same universe as Marvel's Spider-Man. \n[Source: VideoGamesChronicle via CyberDaily]",

Some big plot points have leaked online, and naturally, developer Rocksteady isn’t happy.\nApparently, the leaks stem from a closed beta test in which audio from a pivotal story cutscene plus images and a video showing yet-to-be-revealed characters got out in the wild. We won’t share the details, but they’re not hard to find, so you’re on your own if you want to know more. We just ask that you refrain from posting any spoilers in the comments out of respect for others who wish to remain in the dark.\nRocksteady has posted a statement on its X account addressing the leaks, which we've posted in full below. \nIt’s always a bummer to see leaks of this nature happen, and with Suicide Squad still two months away from launch, interested players who want to be surprised have several weeks of dodging spoilers before they can see the story for themselves. \nSuicide Squad: Kill the Justice League takes place several years after the end of Batman: Arkham Knight and stars Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Captain Boomerang, and King Shark, tasked with defending Earth from a brainwashed Justice League, courtesy of Brainiac. The cooperative open-world adventure has received a lot of vitriol from fans for its shooter-based gameplay, always-online requirement, and live service elements, such as its battle pass. \nYou can watch the game’s most recent trailer from the 2023 Game Awards here.",

This remake, which will be called The One Piece, is an anime adaptation of the manga version of the East Blue saga, meaning it will likely vary from the ongoing One Piece anime. \nBeyond this announcement video, Netflix hasn't revealed much else about The One Piece, so casting and its release remain unknown. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's One Piece Odyssey review.",

Not only is it the first proper video game adaptation of the beloved Marvel character, but it's being made by Arkane Lyon, developers of games like Deathloop and the Dishonored series. That said, the reveal trailer isn't that long, and fans are understandably hungry for more.\nLuckily for them, co-creative director/art director Sébastien Mitton revealed a few images of concept art on X today. These images were created by Sergey Kolesov and Jean-Luc Monnet, and you can see them for yourself below:\n\nConcept art is mainly made to establish a general artistic tone and vibe of a game, so it doesn't always include details present in the finished product. That said, we can infer a lot about the tone of the game based on these images. The dense city streets and subways certainly evoke Arkane's environmental design, and Blade's positions up high and in the shadows suggest stealthy problem-solving, another recurring aspect of Arkane's games.\nFor more Blade, check out our episode of the GI show where we recap the biggest announcements from the Game Awards, or just watch the reveal trailer again.",

The remasters of the series’ defining trilogy are now available on iOS, Android, and Netflix.\nLike all Netflix titles, subscribers have immediate access to the Definitive Edition, which consists of modernized remasters of GTA III, Vice City, and San Andreas. On mobile, you can pick them up in the Trilogy bundle or purchase them individually.\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition first launched for consoles and PCs in November of 2021, while the mobile version was originally planned to launch in early 2022. These improved versions of the 2000s-era classics feature high-resolution textures, advanced lighting/weather effects, and modernized controls (modeled after GTA V), among other bells and whistles. However, due to the player complaints stemming from the collection’s poor launch state, the mobile version was hit with a lengthy delay as Rockstar worked to improve the released versions. \nIn addition to the launch of The Trilogy, Grand Theft Auto VI was announced for a 2025 release.

As the release date nears, developer Bandai Namco has been releasing more and more about the latest entry in its flagship fighting series. We learned about newcomer Reina last month, and recently went hands-on with the game, too – read Game Informer's Tekken 8 preview here. Now, Bandai Namco has revealed the first gameplay trailer for its \"mechanized space ninja\" Yoshimitsu. \nIt did so with a new Tekken 8 gameplay trailer that shows Yoshimitsu ripping and slicing through various fighters in the game's roster. This ninja is no stranger to the Tekken series, having appeared in every mainline numbered Tekken game since the series' start – he's actually my favorite fighter, and for money, this is his best look yet. \nCheck him out in the Tekken 8 Yoshimitsu reveal and gameplay trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Yoshimitsu unsurprisingly relies on his ninja sword to do a lot of damage to enemy fighters. And he does so with the speed the character is known for. \nTekken 8 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on January 26, 2024. \nFor more about the game, watch the Tekken 8 fighter reveal trailers for characters like Nina Williams, Paul Phoenix, Marshall Law, Jun Kazama, and Reina.

          "description": "God of War  Ragnarök's Valhalla DLC is out now on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4, less than a week after it was revealed at The Game Awards 2023. It features a good bit of story content that acts as an epilogue to the events of Ragnarok, and it's packaged within a roguelite structure, meaning it's heavy on combat. Apparently, there's an endgame challenge in Valhalla so difficult that nobody on the dev team could complete it on the DLC's \"Show Me Mastery\" difficulty, according to Valhalla's director Mihir Sheth. \n\"I am so, so curious to see how quickly players will humble us...as they often do...but maybe this time we've beaten them?\" Sheth writes on Twitter, as first reported by Wccftech. \nThere is an endgame challenge in #GodOfWarRagnarokValhalla that no one on the dev team has completed on the hardest difficulty 'Show Me Mastery'.\nDecember 12, 2023\nGod of War  Ragnarök, the sequel to 2018's God of War reboot, hit PS5 and PS4 more than a year ago – read Game Informer's review to find out why it was one of our favorite games of 2022. While many fans expected some kind of follow-up to the ending of  Ragnarök, be it a sequel down the road or an expansion, it's safe to say nobody had roguelite DLC on their bingo cards. But a roguelite DLC called Valhalla is exactly what developer Santa Monica Studios announced last week. Now, God of War Ragnarok's Valhalla DLC is out and apparently has the hardest challenge in the entire series. \nYou can watch us tackle the first hour of  God of War Ragnarök: Valhalla in this episode of Game Informer Live. \nAre you playing God of War Ragnarok's Valhalla DLC?

Although that initial showing was very much a work in progress, today’s video offers a more polished look at what’s to come.\nThe noir game stars a private-eye rodent cleaning up his corruption-riddled city by using his trusty tommy gun to mow down scores of mouse gangsters in cartoonishly violent fashion. Additionally, we get a look at other lethal methods, such as tossing dynamite, shooting down pianos to crash on top of foes, or just knocking goons' heads off with a good punch. Between all of that, the mouse protagonist consumes spinach and tea for presumably health while engaging in other activities such as collecting baseball cards and chatting with characters.\nMouse is the debut title from developer Fumi Games, and the trailer ends with the reveal of a 2025 release window. \n\n\nMouse is slated to come to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. It joins the growing ranks of confirmed 2025 titles such as Grand Theft Auto VI, Monster Hunter: Wilds, Big Walk, Usual June, and Pony Island 2: Panda Circus.",

The last in-person E3 conference happened in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic and other complications prevented it from coming back in full form since. Despite struggles, the ESA attempted to bring E3 back in various ways. \nIt was canceled in 2020 as a result of the pandemic; the 2021 E3 was an all-digital event; the 2022 show was canceled, and this year's attempt with PAX organizer ReedPop was canned, too. \npic.twitter.com/y6dtVkBvNI\nDecember 12, 2023\n\"After more than two decades of hosting an event that has served as a central showcase for the U.S. and global video game industry, the Entertainment Software Association has decided to bring E3 to a close,\" ESA president and CEO Stanely Pierre-Louis told The Washington Post. \"We know the entire industry, players and creators alike have a lot of passion for E3. We share the passion. We know it's difficult to say goodbye to such a beloved event, but it's the right thing to do given the new opportunities our industry has to reach fans and partners.\" \nPierre-Louis told The Washington Post that E3's closure means video games and the surrounding business \"has blossomed in different ways,\" noting that any of the major game companies can create their own individual showcases. He's likely alluding to the format popularized by Nintendo with its Nintendo Directs, which other publishers like Xbox and PlayStation utilize now. \"That's exciting for our industry, and it means it's an opportunity for them to explore how to engage new audiences in different ways.\" \nFor a recap of the history of E3, read The Washington Post's full story here.

By using our affiliate links to buy your favorite games, you granted us a small commission from GOG.com – without having to spend more than the original price.\nEarlier this year, GOG.com announced the discontinuation of its old affiliate program. Instead of using a simple referral link, they are now using two external affiliation networks that contain cross-site tracking, as considered by many ad blockers. Since we have been affiliated with GOG.com since 2009, we were able to use the legacy referral links for a couple of months after they initially discontinued them.\nUnfortunately, our affiliate links were put to rest effective November 22nd, 2023.\nSince we don't feel comfortable that you would have to use external affiliation networks just to support the project, and because tracking users is against our project policies, we decided not to join the new program.\nWe still value GOG.com as an excellent source for legally purchasing games supported by ScummVM. Even though we are not affiliated with them anymore, we'll continue to support their releases, e.g. by adding and updating the game data files' signatures for the ScummVM supported games that are available for purchase from GOG.com in our detection database and providing links to their releases in our list of available games.\nThank you GOG.com and everybody who used our affiliate link for your support over the last 14 years!\n>",
