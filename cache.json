Let’s start by addressing that last complaint: the units of Battle Aces have immense personality. It just doesn’t come across well in screens.\nEach is a mix of bug and robot, with a clutch of finely observed, quirky-but-never-gratuitous animations that immediately had me choosing favourites when I played the game at Summer Game Fest. \"Our main unit design concept artist, his father was also an illustrator and nature illustrator at that, so he's already accomplished with animal designs, but he also loves mechs and robots too,\" notes Uncapped Games art director Ted Park. \"So he's kind of melded both worlds as much as he can.\"\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I'd been in Paris to see open world action-RPG Shadow Of The Erdtree early and when I got back, Edwin messaged me. He asked whether I thought it was big enough to consider the DLC a pseudo-sequel, and at the time I said something along the lines of, \"It's hefty, but I think that's probably pushing it\".\nI was wrong. The Land Of Shadow may not be as expansive as the base game's Lands Between, but it's knottier, denser, more of a twisting mass that burrows into the earth and soars into the skies. For this reason I think it produces some of Elden Ring's finest moments, as exploration leads to a truer sense of discovery reminiscent of old Souls. But I also think its sheer density exposes more chinks in its open world format, where its interconnected sprawl leads to even greater recollection paralysis.\nRead more",

Valve have helpfully shared a list of the most played Steam demos during this latest, gravest round of next festivity, and it covers a reasonable range. I mean, I wasn't that surprised to see an open world survival shooter with monsters at the top of the ladder - why else would we dedicate a bunch of Best Of features to such things? - but I am surprised that number three is a leering parody of neglect.

The truth is the pixellated hangout zone of the early 2000s never went away. It has been alive this whole time. You forgot about the Hotel.

I'd save up to buy one of the premium headliners, attempt to get my money's worth inside a week, then swap it for a respected double-A and perhaps a sub-£8 oddity with the manual missing - nesting one purchase within the other like a series of Matryoshka dolls.\nThis was my Big Short, my Moneyball. But it had a drawback: often, I was so eager to leapfrog to another game before the trade-in price changed that I skimmed RPGs that are now considered classics. The big one was Suikoden 2, which I spent only an evening with before gambling that I'd eke more FunValue out of a game with a less traditional battle system. I can't remember what I traded that for, which says it all. Another was Baten Kaitos on Gamecube, which - yes, we are finally getting to the point here - has just been rereleased on Steam in the shape of a Baten Kaitos I & II HD Remaster. I can't remember what I traded Baten Kaitos for either, which again, says it all. Please, gentle reader - be better.\r\n \nRead more",

I'm not entirely convinced it has longevity beyond its impeccably scorched and dented PS1 vibes, but I definitely think you should try the demo, now that the early access version is out.\n Read more",

It's a classic pre-disaster setup for a mostly traditional monster story, yet the game sticks expertly to the first-person horror form, and its voice actors' performances are so spot-on, that it'd feel churlish to judge this foaming fear simulator for sticking to type.

It's another indication that this will be more biffy action game than thinky party-based RPG. The upside, assuming you find that last sentence disappointing, is that exploration and combat will be more \"intimate\", and individual characters will have more screentime to bounce off each other and flourish as personalities.

Shaken, stirred and finally ignited for want of two-sentence updates about Dragon Age, the Maw emitted a full 13% of its cosmo-puissance into Mundus and took a grievous bite out of the ailing and fearful lasagne of reality itself. Hated friends, beloved enemies - I am very sad to say that the proud nation of Dimplexland is no more.\n Read more",

          "description": "Disco Samurai is a game that’s so difficult I’d have given up playing sooner if it didn’t contain so many of my absolute favourite action game things. Tense, decisive duels. Violence that’s both brutal and a little silly. Scalpel-sharp parry n' strike back-and-forths. Short stages that dole out chunky progression hits of dopamine, as quickly as they wrest those hits away from you with another humbling beatdown. Perhaps most importantly, it aims to do one thing - rhythm combat - and does it brilliantly. It's got teeth, but it's also got groove.\n \nRead more",

Deep Dip 2 is a fan-made tower of racetracks that was published as a challenge to the racing game's community last month. It is 16 floors of unfathomably difficult ramps, tunnels, ledges, pipes, and beams. A simple mistake sees drivers plummeting to the bottom, like the sad cauldron man of Getting Over It. The first three players to finish would share a prize pool of over $32,000. Over the weekend, one player has now managed it, and another has since joined him.

You do get a party, drawn from a retinue of seven, larger-than-life, romanceable companions encompassing a range of classes, abilities and go-faster hairdos, but control of that party has been streamlined, and there's a God Of Warlike emphasis on booting Fade demons into pits.

Anno 117: Pax Romana will be the earliest period for the franchise yet, travelling back to the time of a peaceful Ancient Rome. After the biggest gap between Anno games yet, we at least won’t have to wait too long for the newly revealed entry: it’s out next year.\nRead more",

I was similarly tickled by the sight of her breathing through a bamboo pipe while swimming underwater, and I emitted a gentle hum of approval, like a smartphone switching on for the very first time, when she impaled a silhouette through a paper door. Respectable shinobing, for sure. Papa Tenchu would be proud.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "One of my absolute most favouritest Steam Deck cases, besides the one you get for free with the Steam Deck OLED, is the Dbrand Project Killswitch. It’s not so much a carrying vessel as a hardened second skin, providing protection without all the bag-hogging bulk of a traditional case – while throwing in handy bonuses like a clip-on kickstand and grippy thumbstick covers. For owners of the Asus ROG Ally, the recent launch of a Project Killswitch for their own handheld PC should therefore represent glad tidings with extra gladness, even if it won’t also fit the upcoming ROG Ally X.\nThank the new device’s bigger battery, wider SSD and reworked connection layout for that particular lack of forwards compatibility, as the ROG Ally X’s thicker dimensions will make it just slightly too beefy to slip into the Killswitch’s skintight silicone. A shame, but at least it makes a quality addition to the original Ally right this second. I’ve been manhandling one for a week now, and it’s just as practical and protective as the Steam Deck version.\nRead more",

          "description": "Indiana Jones And The Great Circle, Indy’s upcoming FPS adventure game, has a new ‘Official Showcase Reveal’ trailer, officially showcasing and revealing basically nothing about the game except that it features some pretty and decently acted cutscenes, which we already knew from the previous reveal. It does have snow nazis in however, possibly the rarest flavour of Nazi after Cookies n’ Cream and Original. You’ll find the trailer below. Be careful: it’s official. Also, it’s mainly just one very long cutscene, so if you want to save that stuff for when the game’s out, maybe don’t bother.\n \nRead more",

She could also be the villain. Then again, Fable is a series in which you can be the villain. Egad, such shenanigans! \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "It wouldn't be a new Warframe update if there weren't a handful of new materials for you to collect. Duviri Paradox is the best example of a recent update that introduced a lot of materials, but each update tends to include a couple. The release of Jade Shadows is no different, and how you can use them can be a little confusing. Here's what Vestigial and Volatile Motes are in Warframe.\n\n\nHow to get and use Vestigial and Volatile Motes in Warframe\n\n\nVestigial and Volatile Motes are acquired from the new Ascension game mode, accessible through the node Brutus, Uranus. During the mission, you'll fight various enemies that will occasionally drop Vestigial or Volatile Motes, which can then be picked up. These come in at a few each run but typically give you more Vestigial Motes than Volatile.\n\n\nImage via Destructoid.\n\n\nThese need to be taken to the Larunda Relay orbiting Mercury. Once there, you want to head to Ordis, who's found in the Mission Control room on the right side of the relay. Alternatively, you can use the Fast Travel option in the Pause Menu to go straight to Ordis. Here, you're able to access several shops. The Release Vestigial Motes shop lets you access Jade's component blueprints alongside other useful items such as Arcanes. Other shops let you spend your Volatile Motes on other assorted items, including several cosmetics.\n\n\nImage via Destructoid.\n\n\nBe mindful that Volatile Motes are only available as part of the Operation: Belly of the Beast event that launched with the Jade Shadows update. Once the Operation disappears, only Vestigial Motes will be earnable.

          "description": "While not every Warframe update includes one, the updates that include new cinematic quests tend to be the most interesting ones. Between updates like The New War, Whispers in the Walls, and now Jade Shadows stick out more when you need to deal with story tidbits and cool setpieces instead of a new mission type to farm. Here's how to access the latest main story quest for Warframe, known aptly as Jade Shadows.\n\n\nHow to play the Jade Shadows main quest in Warframe\n\n\nImage via Destructoid.\n\n\nThe Jade Shadows quest becomes accessible after completing the New War main quest. This will require a lot of other quests to be completed beforehand, mostly centered around the main story. If you're only partway through, you should focus on that instead of concerning yourself with most of the new update. However, those who have completed The New War can access the quest through the kiosk on the left of the Orbiter's cockpit. Find the Jade Shadows quest in the menu, click on it, and select Begin in the bottom right.\n\n\nIf you are going to jump into the quest, there are a few things you should keep in mind. The mission is 30-40 minutes long depending on how quickly you tend to speed through content. You also won't be able to access the rest of the game until the mission is complete, so you should get anything else you want done taken care of now.\n\n\nUpon completion, you'll get a handful of nice cosmetics along with the Jade main blueprint, granting you access to her provided you have her parts already. If you don't, they can be acquired through the new Ascension game mode on the node Brutus, Uranus.\n\nThe post How to access the Jade Shadows quest in Warframe appeared first on Destructoid.",

You'll also spot several weapons, with a powerful laser gun among your many options. Here's how to get the Tri-Beam laser rifle in Fortnite.\n\n\nWhere to get the Tri-Beam Laser Rifle in Fortnite Chapter 5, Season 3\n\n\nThe main ways to get the Tri-Beam laser rifle is to find it as floor or chest loot or eliminate an enemy wielding one. While this is luck-dependent, you'll often find one if you encounter a lot of other players or frequently loot chests, as it's a relatively common drop compared to legendary and mythic-grade weapons. Similarly, if someone else got lucky and found, you can defeat the min combat and quickly pick up their laser rifle to take it for yourself.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nAlternatively, you can also talk to the T-60 Power Armor NPC between the Nitrodrome and Mount Olympus. You'll spot the character in a small shack, where they'll sell you the Tri-Beam laser rifle for 300 gold bars. If you have enough gold bars on you, you can buy the gun to use it instantly, allowing you to get started on your quests early on. Just be careful while doing this, as you might find other players also trying to get the rifle. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nOnce you get your hands on the Tri-Beam laser rifle, you can use it to complete weekly quests, progress through seasonal missions, or try something new. While the gun doesn't boast any special abilities, it has unlimited ammo and decently high damage, making it a good option throughout most of your match.\n\nThe post How to find the Tri-Beam Laser Rifle in Fortnite appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "For those viewers who were left feeling a little confused by the reveal of Sutekh in the latest episode of Doctor Who, The Legend of Ruby Sunday, there is hope in the shape of Tales of the TARDIS. \n\n\nTales of the TARDIS was originally created to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the show, and usually features previous iterations of the Doctor and their corresponding companions on board the Memory TARDIS, a TARDIS which features significant items and designs from every generation of Doctor Who. However, this week’s episode will be slightly different as the Doctor and Ruby enter the Memory TARDIS and travel back in time to 1911. \n\n\nViewers will be able to get some answers as to who Sutekh is, accompanied by the Doctor and Ruby as they take a pause in events currently happening and take some time to consider what they've been through over the last few weeks. \n\n\nImage via BBC\n\n\nAccording to the BBC, the “timeless classic” Pyramids of Mars has been turned into feature-length omnibus episode with updated visuals and a cosmic makeover. Taking multiple episodes and condensing them into the 75 minute run-time of Tales of the TARDIS is no mean feat, but it should provide some answers for those who still have questions regarding Sutekh. \n\n\nThere have previously been seven episodes of Tales of the TARDIS, looking back on everything from the Cybermen to Viking curses, though this will be the first time we’ve seen a current Doctor experiencing events of his previous regenerations. With Empire of Death being released just one day later, this might be the last chance to catch up on exactly who Sutekh is, and why he's so dangerous.\n\n\nTales of the TARDIS will air live on BBC4 in the UK on June 20 at 8 p.m. GMT, and will be available to watch on BBC iPlayer at any time after that point.  \n\nThe post Doctor Who: The Doctor and Ruby will feature in a new Tales of the TARDIS episode before Empire or Death appeared first on Destructoid.",

Originally titled Project TL, Throne and Liberty is seen by many as somewhat of a spiritual successor to NCSOFT's popular Lineage MMORPG series. The MMO has already been released in South Korea, but has been receiving some updates and changes before Amazon Games brought it to the global audience.\n\n\n\n\nThrone of Liberty features a dynamic PvP system that focuses on conquest battles and castle sieges. Winning these battles allows guilds to get valuable buffs and guild resources that increase the guilds ability to compete in PvE as well, creating a system where all facets of gameplay benefit each other.\n\n\nThe Castle Siege system is said to support thousands of players as they fight over a castle, using unique strategic resources such as Golems to join them in the fight.\n\n\n\nIn Throne and Liberty, there are numerous goals that can be achieved through guilds, including guild rankings, Conquest Battles, and Castle Sieges. Guilds are at the core of strategic competitive battles. Guild members not only work together to achieve common goals, but also benefit from a guild reward system that includes distributing raid items and sharing rewards from events among members. However, the greatest appeal of a guild is the sense of belonging it provides, ensuring that you always have companions by your side.\n- Moonseop Lee, Game Design Director at NCSOFT\n\n\n\nAmazon Games also announced an upcoming open beta taking place from July 18 to July 23 on all platforms with cross-play enabled.\n\n\nThrone and Liberty will release on September 17 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S and will feature cross-platform play across all three platforms.\n\nThe post NCSOFT MMORPG Throne and Liberty set to release September 17, open beta next month appeared first on Destructoid.",

Yet despite the amount of complaints lobbied against them, it sounds like Capcom has no plans to adjust the microtransactions.\n\n\nRecently, Kotaku got to speak with Street Fighter 6 director Takayuki Nakayama and producer Shuhei Matsumoto, and it asked them about the discontent surrounding the microtransactions. There is a lot of additional content in Street Fighter 6, such as customization items, that you can't just buy with real money. You have to first purchase the in-game Fighter Coin…",

While it may have been easy to miss last night's announcement, the collection is now available on Steam.\n\n\nThe Steam drop of the remastered set — which includes Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean and Baten Kaitos Origins — is priced at $49.99. Those who pick it up between now and July 1 will get upgraded to the Month 1 Edition, which packs the games with a digital art book. As Bandai Namco details, the art book includes \"concept art, character designs, historical documents, and the latest visuals\" for both games. All of the content within is in Japanese. \n\n\n\n\nBaten Kaitos series character designer Nakaba Higurashi whipped up a new illustration to commemorate the Steam release.\n\n\nIn addition to updated visuals, the remastered versions of the Baten Kaitos games add in some progression-focused features for those who just want to experience the story. There's the ability to turn on No Encounters so you can sail through the game without having to worry about battles. If you want to fight but don't want battles to impede progress, there's also an Instant KO setting that lets you defeat enemies in a single attack. \n\n\nImage via Bandai Namco\n\n\nBaten Kaitos I & II HD Remaster is 10 percent off on Steam for a limited time, so if you want to grab it now, you can do so for $44.99. \n\nThe post Baten Kaitos I & II HD Remaster goes live on Steam appeared first on Destructoid.",

At its core, Romancing SaGa 2 is about prospering over generations as opposed to focusing on the short term.\n\n\nThis is another one I've yet to play, primarily because it was originally released in Japan and I just never got around to playing.

The Hundred Line -Last Defense Academy- is arriving as a Nintendo Switch exclusive in early 2025.\n\n\n\n\nBoasting Danganronpa's signature art style and narrative parallels, The Hundred Line -Last Defense Academy- takes place in an apocalyptic world where mysterious, hostile creatures are invading. Playing as the protagonist, Takumi Sumino, your goal is to survive 100 days as you and your fellow classmates defend your school against these creatures. \n\n\nRight from the get-go, we see its resemblance to previous Spike Chunsoft games like those from the Danganronpa series. Some of the most notable similarities are the existence of a small animal mascot, the forced enrolment of 16 students in a questionable school, and the collapse of society as monsters destroy everything in their path. The premise is the same outside of the absence of murder mystery and case-solving, but its gameplay is vastly different.\n\n\nImage via Spike Chunsoft (Nintendo Direct)\n\n\nRather than being a primarily visual novel-based game, The Hundred Line -Last Defense Academy- features a combat grid where you'll arrange your characters and defeat waves of enemies, with things getting increasingly challenging as you progress through the 100 days. While little is known about the specifics of gameplay and combat, we at least know there's some variety here. \n\n\nThe Hundred Line -Last Defense Academy- will launch on Nintendo Switch in early 2025.

Not only does this mean the two games will be available on modern hardware, but this marks the second game's debut in the West.\n\n\nFor context, the original Ace Attorney Investigations, which sees you play as prosecutor Miles Edgeworth as he solves crimes, came out in 2010. Its sequel launched just a year later in 2011, but only in Japan, with Capcom opting not to localise it. Fans did come together to make their own translation, but many had assumed the game would never officially come to the West.\n\n\n\n\nCapcom seems eager to push Ace Attorney more nowadays, as evidenced by how all the mainline games are readily available. This includes The Great Ace Attorney duology, which was also Japan-only for many years. All in all, fans of the series are eating well.\n\n\nThis new collection will feature enhanced visuals, with more fluid and detail character animations, but there will be an option to switch to the original graphics as seen in the DS versions. Obviously, this won't be a Switch exclusive and will also launch on PC via Steam, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

Link battles off a horde of enemies to free Zelda from a crystal. However, this time around, Link gets sucked into a strange rift, and this time it's up to Zelda to step up to the plate and save Hyrule. Instead of wielding a sword, Zelda wields a mysterious staff that can duplicate items called echoes. Once the princess learns an echo of something she can re-create it however many times you like to help traverse the map and move past obstacles. \n\n\n\n\nWooden boxes, old beds, tables, and water blocks are just a few items Zelda can use. The first trailer gives players a first look at how the duplication system works. For example, Zelda duplicated multiple beds to scale a wall. Instead of traditional combat, the staff can create echoes of monsters, and each enemy has a unique set of abilities that can be used for different situations. Nintendo set out to create an experience that will be different for players, based on how they decide to use echoes. \n\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom launches on September 26, 2024.

          "description": "There was a lot of exciting news for retro gamers in the Nintendo Direct. One that got me good was the reveal of the Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection. This collection brings together such out-of-reach licensed classics as The Punisher and Marvel vs. Capcom 2.\n\n\nOkay, here’s the trailer:\n\n\n\n\nAnd here’s the list of games. Capitalization is all Capcom marketing:\n\n\n\nX-MEN CHILDREN OF THE ATOM\n\n\nMARVEL SUPER HEROES\n\n\nX-MEN VS. STREET FIGHTER\n\n\nMARVEL SUPER HEROES vs. STREET FIGHTER\n\n\nMARVEL vs. CAPCOM CLASH OF SUPER HEROES\n\n\nMARVEL vs. CAPCOM 2 New Age of Heroes\n\n\nTHE PUNISHER\n\n\n\nThis is extremely exciting to me. I’m always thrilled when old licensed games get re-released because I know it’s often a lot of hoops for the publisher to jump through. Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 is probably the top of the heap, but that doesn’t mean that the others included aren’t great on their own. \n\n\nThe more obscure entry here is The Punisher.  Rather than a fighting game,  it's a beat-’em-up where you play as the eponymous anti-hero and Nick Fury. It’s no Alien vs. Predator (hopefully, one day), but it’s appropriately violent and an excellent arcade title.\n\n\nIt comes with some bells and whistles, too. There will be Online modes with rollback netplay, and training modes for all the fighting games. There is also a spectator mode, a jukebox, and screen filters.\n\n\nMarvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics will be released later this year for Switch, PS4, and PC.\n\nThe post Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection is full of retro licensed goodness appeared first on Destructoid.",

Red Hook Studios announced the news during today's Nintendo Direct, with a release date set for July 15, 2024. Like the original Darkest Dungeon, Darkest Dungeon 2 has been optimized to make use of the Nintendo Switch with this release.\n\n\n\n\nThe Nintendo Switch release of Darkest Dungeon 2 has been optimized to run on the Switch and take advantage of the touchscreen. Alongside the base game, the Binding Blade DLC which adds two new heroes, a special questline, a wandering boss, and more is also available as part of an Darkest Dungeon 2 Oblivion Edition.\n\n\nIn Darkest Dungeon 2, players embark on a journey through five campaigns each with its own boss and mechanics as they form a party, equip their stagecoach, and engage in battle across a decaying landscape striving to avert an apocalypse.\n\n\nDarkest Dungeon 2 releases on Nintendo Switch on July 15, 2024.\n\nThe post Darkest Dungeon 2 delves into Nintendo Switch next month appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "During the newest Nintendo Direct, four fan-favourite classics were confirmed to be coming to the Nintendo Switch's online service. And best of all, they're dropping later today.\n\n\nThe first two are a pair of Game Boy Advance games: The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords and Metroid: Zero Mission for Game Boy Advance. The former is a compilation title that includes a GBA remake of the beloved SNES game A Link to the Past, and a multiplayer spin-off that sees four Links team up and explore randomised dungeons. This will allow for online co-op.\n\n\nImage via Nintendo\n\n\nAs for Metroid: Zero Mission, it's a GBA remake of the very first Metroid game, letting you experience an updated re-telling of Samus' first adventure. It may not be as fancy looking as Metroid Prime 4, but it's still worth playing.\n\n\nThe other two additions are a pair of Nintendo 64 games: Turok: Dinosaur Hunter and Rare's original Perfect Dark. Both of these are first-person shooters, with Turok being all about, well, hunting dinosaurs, while Perfect Dark is set in an alternate future where agent Joanna Dark goes on a mission to thwart an evil corporation. Perfect Dark will also feature online multiplayer. These two will be exclusive to Nintendo's new catalogue of mature rated titles.\n\nThe post Perfect Dark, Turok, and more are coming to Nintendo Switch Online today appeared first on Destructoid.",

The title arrived as an Apple Arcade exclusive in 2021 and currently holds an 80 out of 100 on reviews aggregate site Metacritic. It also won the award for Mobile game of the Year at the 25th Annual DICE Awards.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Mistwalker was founded in 2004 by Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, who produced Fantasian. The studio frequently collaborates with longtime Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu, who also worked on Fantasian as the composer. To date, Mistwalker has released multiple critically acclaimed games, including Blue Dragon, Lost Odyssey, and The Last Story.</p>\n\n<p>Fantasian uses similar turn-based design conventions as were found in many of the most classic Final Fantasy games. The title also implements several quality-of-life modernizations, such as the ability to skip random encounters with enemy types you've already defeated until they choose to fight them all at once. Despite being a mobile title, Fantasian's ties to Apple Arcade means it does not include any microtransactions or paid DLC.</p>\n\n<p>Fantasian Neo Dimension arrives on Nintendo Switch this holiday season.</p>",

However, on the surface, it has little to do with the original game created by Howard Scott Warshaw. After all, one is a 2D space shooter while another is a modernized sci-fi Metroidvania. However, with homages to Atari and gaming's past galore, all developed by a renowned studio like WayForward, this release could be one to look forward to when it arrives on its newly announced September release date.</p>\n\n<p>Taking control of a hacker named Emi (codename Yar), players must blast, hack, and sneak their way through various areas. As she progresses, she unlocks new powers that allow her to take out enemies more easily and, in true Metroidvania fashion, access new areas. Yars Rising is published by Atari and pays homage to the company's past, including bosses and minigames that borrow gameplay elements from classic Atari titles.</p>\n\n<p>Though the game is coming to a broader array of platforms, PlayStation 5 and Switch players can pick up physical editions of the game. We recently had a chance to go hands-on with Yars Rising and included our impressions in our list of the coolest things we saw at Summer Game Fest. To read that entry and see the rest of the list, head <a data-entity-substitution=\"canonical\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"876adf32-d734-4ecc-a6ff-6656f84dde7b\" href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/sgf-2024/2024/06/09/the-coolest-games-we-played-at-summer-game-fest-2024-and-more\">here</a>.

When that failed to happen, the terms of the injunction seemed to be up for negotiation, at least for a while. Having done little to convince the court that infringement wouldn't continue, DoodStream's operators and associates are now banned from running the site.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

          "description": "In a universe where bagels meet bars, the BAGEL engine has been perfectly toasted, and the ScummVM team is now ready to serve a slice of The Space Bar nostalgia. No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.\nThis is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.\nIf you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.\nNow, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)\n>",
