PogoGirl, developed by Ohsat Games (which consists of just one person, Andrej Preradovic!), follows a pogo champion whose prize pogo stick is stolen, and she must use another in order to track it down. The game launches on the eShop on 10th February, and it's giving us some serious Sega nostalgia.\nLooking like it sits between the Master System and the Mega Drive, Go! Go! PogoGirl levels are themed around the four seasons and are all designed around PogoGirl's pogo-jumping skills. Each season will have five levels each for a total of 20 levels. And, well, if you take a good look at the levels, you might spot some similarities with a certain blue hedgehog's Green Hill Zone... those flowers look awfully familiar.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Now it's suddenly dropped onto Nintendo Switch and, far from the mess we had thought it might turn out to be, it's actually a really fun little slice of multiplayer mayhem. However, it's not without its issues.\nOddballers sees players jump into colourful top-down arenas in order to hurl dodgeballs, chickens, bombs, and lots of other goofy items at one another in order to emerge victorious. The action is then made even more chaotic by a multitude of environmental dangers; lawnmowers, acid bombs, electrical charges, and so on, that keep you on your toes as you charge around looking to wipe out your friends and/or a bunch of the game's relatively capable bots.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

This is potentially the next entry in City Connection's S-Tribute series, which focuses on a number of arcade and Sega Saturn titles, enhancing them for modern audiences.\nBatsugun is a title from 1993 developed by Toplan which was later ported to the Saturn in 1996 in Japan only. Batsugun might look like your typical bullet hell shooter, but the game introduces experience points that allow you to upgrade your main gun, and after two upgrades, you use the experience for extra bomb stock. The game is also often considered to be the first 'manic shooter' with its ridiculous bullet patterns and complex enemy waves.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

In Canada, that translated to the Nintendo Switch being \"the number one selling system in Canada for the fifth consecutive year,\" Pennefather states, citing that a large part of that is the appeal to a \"broad and massive audience\", comprising around 53% of Canadians, roughly half of which are female.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The jokey dating-sim-but-everyone's-a-talking-table type vein never quite grabbed me. Unless Monster Prom counts? Hmm.\r\n\nRaptor Boyfriend is more the lighthearted comedy kind, but with through lines on social anxiety and navigating confusing coming-of-age relationships. It is also not actually about having a raptor boyfriend.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I’m 21 and my knees click, which means I must be turning into stone faster than someone having a staring contest with Medusa. So, I vowed to exercise a few times a week. Then, during my first week back at work, vid bud Liam told me to try Age Of Empires II. Never before has a New Year’s Resolution been abandoned so fast. I really wanted to stick with it. Promise.\nBut! After my first match, the following 30 hours vanished quicker than the Galaxy Caramels in a box of Celebrations. I became obsessed. I mastered AOE II's low AI difficulties and quickly used the Advanced Techniques tutorial to learn build orders. Before I knew it, I had a Google Doc filled with step-by-step plans for various playstyles, the perfect strategies for any scenario. But that Google Doc ended up ruining everything for me. If that recent Xbox release with the good gamepad controls has you tempted to revisit Age Of Empires II on PC, do not make a Google Doc. You’ve been warned.\nRead more",

          "description": "Can I tell you a secret? I'm terrible at Battle Brothers. I'm still terrible at Battle Brothers, even after playing it on and off for a few years. It's a bit like Blood Bowl, oddly, in that it's all about mitigating risks. And like Blood Bowl, despite having a decent head for tactics and planning on the fly, I am hopeless at sticking to them when I see a new idea, thus: terrible. At it.\nBut since an update last March looks likely to be its last big one, it's about time to get over myself and gave it a proper look as a complete package. It's long overdue, in fact. Although I still struggle to fully enjoy it, Battle Brothers is an unusually good tactical game, and the one to beat for the burgeoning subgenre of mercenary management sims. That's partly because it sticks so resolutely to its guns. Where Bannerlord faltered by throwing extraneous stuff unrelated to the core combat that should have defined it, and other open world games typically take a varied but shallow \"do and be everything\" approach, Battle Brothers resists dilution of that core concept.\nRead more",

We also discuss the reasons a developer might have to come out and clarify that their game is, in fact, real.

          "description": "With the world continuing to disintegrate around us in real-time, it can be tempting to cast our eyes skyward in the hope of finding a better future. If KeokeN's Deliver Us games are anything to go by, though, life in outer space isn't all that peachy either. In Deliver Us The Moon, you may remember the scientists in charge of the moon's Earth-saving energy beam tech ended up having a bit of a Rapture moment, sabotaging all their good work (and the future of Earth in the process) and buggering off to goodness knows where to start life afresh in their newly birthed utopia. In its sequel, Deliver Us Mars, you find out those rogue astronauts didn't actually go that far at all. Yep, they hopped on over to the red planet and set up shop there, and when a strange transmission comes through revealing their location, it serves as the catalyst to send yet another crew into space to go and investigate. \r\n\nThis time, though, you're right at the heart of its central conflict. By casting players as Kathy, the daughter of one of those rogue astronauts, Deliver Us Mars tells a much more fraught and personal tale of what kind of future humanity should be pursuing: should we, in fact, be turning our efforts toward a life in outer space, or should we be doing everything in our power to try and save the dire, pretty much almost dead husk of a planet we call home? \nRead more",

I might smugly write something like “it elevates the genre” while sipping wine and eating cheese, musing on how a game pushes the media forward as an art form. Other times I just want to write that a game is really bloody good, actually, and I like it lots.\nHi-Fi Rush falls into the latter category. Developer Tango Gameworks shadow-dropped the rhythm-action game out of nowhere shortly after an Xbox presentation, jettisoning The Evil Within’s murky mental hospitals and Ghostwire: Tokyo's supernatural shinanigans for something markedly different: bright pulsating neon colours and a gang of loveable anime ruffians, where every whack and dodge is underscored by a beat. \nHi-Fi Rush is an action-adventure game with a mechanical core fuelled by musical beats. Protagonist Chai has undergone a risky medical procedure and emerged from the other side with a robot arm and an iPod accidentally implanted in his chest meaning his every waking moment is punctuated by a catchy beat. We too see these rhythmic motions, as Hi-Fi Rush's soda pop-infused world moves to this steady pulse - platforms move in time with the music, lights flash in pleasing rhythmic patterns, and enemies attack to the beat of the drum. \nRead more",

To echo AliceB’s sentiments upon revisiting Portal, it’s fuckin’ Minecraft.\nIn fact, I think I could take her Portal revisited intro, replace every instance of “Portal” with “Minecraft”, and call it a day. It’s Minecraft! Of course it was game of the year. It was arguably the game of the decade, an absolute all timer. I won’t spend many words explaining why it is good, because those words would be redundant fodder, like the bloke fighting a soaring dragon by poking the ground under his feet with a sword.

          "description": "Arkane’s co-op, vampire huntin’ shooter is only a couple of months away, but there's some eyebrow-raising news in Redfall land. On top of being a vampire-filled hellscape, Redfall will also require an always-online connection, even when playing the game in single-player without buddies. This comes courtesy of a Bethesda FAQ page that states a “persistent connection is required” for co-op and single-player, and that a Bethesda.net account is also necessary to play the game. Many co-op and multiplayer games have required a persistent connection as of late, but it’s disappointing in Redfall’s case since the game is playable alone. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I loved Obsidian’s medieval mystery Pentiment when it released last November, and part of my admiration was for its incredible art style. It was like the dev team had nicked a bunch of 16th-century manuscripts, scanned the delicate pages, and then fully animated them to life.\nPentiment was clearly made by a team who had a deep love for the time period, and the same can be said for Inkulinati, a 2D turn-based strategy game that also uses illuminated medieval drawings. But Yaza Games have taken a bit of a different direction with Inkulinati's vibe by adding a whole heap of cheeky humour. You wouldn't think it would suit the stuffy nature of religious manuscripts, but actually those monks were pretty cheeky blokes, and Inkulinati's humour is done in a way that stays completely loyal to the source material, fart jokes and all.\nRead more",

This news comes after 95 employees lost their jobs, following mass layoffs across Microsoft. The layoffs affected long-time 343 devs, as well as contractors who only had a few days' notice. Halo Infinite has been trying to find its footing after a rocky first year, but this report doesn’t inspire much hope from fans, at least for the series’ short-term future. The report delves into the studio’s switch to a different engine, an upcoming battle royale game, and most importantly, the lack of any single-player content in development. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Jett: The Far Shore was, like the jagged colossi that roamed its lavender skies, an odd beast. When it emerged on the Epic Game Store in the autumn of 2021, you could see the conflict roiling in its belly - between the linear science fiction short story on the surface, and the freeroaming “Metroid snowboarding game” fighting to get out from underneath it.\n“Once the story finished, I hoped an endgame would open up and allow me to play freely in its world,” I wrote in our Jett review. “That I’d have more opportunities to watch great Ghoke, the red sun, rise in real time, and to ponder the Far Shore’s fascinating mysteries at length. Instead, I could only replay previous chapters. If only Jett had embraced a rhythm as organic as its inspired ecosystem.”\r\n\n\r\nWhen the Jett team read that review, they didn’t disagree. “You put your finger on it more accurately than anybody else, which was, ‘It really feels like this is building up to some sort of systemic-focused, open world endgame,’” says Superbrothers founder Craig Adams. “And internally we were like, ‘Yeah, it is.’” What they knew, and I didn’t, was that The Far Shore was just the first part of a two-campaign story. That journey has now been completed with the launch of Given Time, a bonus 12-hour adventure that coincides with Jett’s long-awaited Steam release. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Then there's the youngest, who's extremely likeable, in large part because she's learned what behaviours to avoid just by watching the others make mistakes; even if she's modelled herself on the eldest a bit too closely in her quest for approval, and so hasn't really forged her own identity.\nThen there's Life Is Strange 2: the awkward middle child. Still very recognisably a member of the family, but the one that stands out in all the photos because he's just a bit gawky. He's experimented a lot with his storytelling and plotline in an attempt to make himself stand out, and it's only sort-of worked. His romantic subplots are underdeveloped, his villains are one-dimensional, and his attempt at tackling a Very Serious Issue has grown in all crooked.\nRead more",

          "description": "Last Friday afternoon, 40 developers from Ubisoft Paris gathered to strike in the first labour stoppage of Ubisoft’s history. It's the capper on what has been a turbulent month for the company. Three weeks ago Ubisoft announced they were cancelling three unannounced games amid “worsening macroeconomic conditions.” In a letter to employees, CEO Yves Guillemot said that “the ball is in your court” in regard to hitting deadlines and overturning Ubisoft’s sticky financial situation. French union Solidaires Informatique said that Guillemot’s \"words mean something: overtime, managerial pressure, burnout, etc,\" and called on Ubisoft Paris employees to strike for better pay and working hours. It seems some devs heard the call.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The road to launch has been a uniquely turbulent one for The Settlers: New Allies. After an eight-year absence, the next entry in Ubisoft’s beloved city-building series was finally revealed in 2018, only to be delayed indefinitely two years later. The game then reemerged in a fresh new form in 2022, but a less than favourable reception from long-term fans to its closed beta saw the game delayed indefinitely once again.\r\n\n\r\n12 months later, The Settlers: New Allies is all the better for it. An extended delay is never an easy decision to make, yet the team at Ubisoft Düsseldorf (formerly Blue Byte) has seen this additional development time as an opportunity to reach out to those most familiar with the series. “We learned [more] than just what was needed for the game,” creative director Christian Hagerdorn tells me during a recent preview event. “One of our biggest focuses was to be absolutely transparent with the players. Not just on where we were standing, but where we were going. We've been collecting the feedback as we were developing”.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Such is the fate of Frey, who falls through a portal into Athia and finds that world in mortal peril. Although if I were here I'd be a bit disappointed. It's all very well being able to zoom around doing magic parkour everywhere, but there isn't much to do or many places to go. Not a single talking unicorn to be seen.\nForspoken is somehow both full and devoid of content. There is a huge open world, but it is mostly empty. There is an epic story of magic, other universes, and saving the world, but it only takes up a couple of days. I actually enjoyed a lot of Forspoken, but it gets more fun the more you play, and then it's over; I didn't pre-order this game for sixty odd quid, and if I had I'd be disappointed. Even the much-Tweeted about annoying dialogue doesn't happen much, and isn't contextually annoying. Forspoken is annoying, though, just not in the ways you might expect if all you've seen is people discussing out-of-context clips from cutscenes.\nRead more",

And before him, Ken Levine had laid down the cobbles of Thief’s setting, defining its noir-ish tone before heading off to work on System Shock 2. Yet Looking Glass games weren’t driven by a singular 90s auteur. In fact, the very absence of ego in the studio’s culture meant its many “bright stars” were happy to adhere to a shared vision.\r\n\n \nRead more",

As many RPS Treehouse members found out at EGX 2022, it's a game that sees you holding your keyboard vertically, and pressing buttons to (sort of) tie your tie onscreen. Now, Ludipe's back with a new co-op sequel called Back Scratching Simulator 2023 where you're once again doing terrible, but brilliant things with a vertical keyboard.\nRead more",

I want to say \"a year ago\", but that could turn out to be any time in the last three years if I actually check. It didn't quite push me over the \"Article Threshold\" back then, but having given it a proper go now it's out of early access, it's time.\nYou're a little spaceship, with a simple but intriguing backstory, who's appeared near an inhabited planet. A transmission asks you to repair their defensive shield before \"the Deadeye\" arrives to genocide them, which, uh, okay I think I know whose side I'm on here, game.\nRead more",

So I reinstalled the game I already own. Turns out, after a few vital (yet easy) tweaks and fixes, the 2008 game is still perfectly playable.

Xenotilt transports the silver sphere action from the occult cathedral surroundings of Demon’s Tilt to a floating space hulk called the Samaritan. Forget any thoughts of friendly assistance to rack up a high score though, because this game’s subtitle is Hostile Pinball Action. You can see just how hostile Xenotilt can get by watching the trailer below.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Above the Berlin Samurai Museum's gift shop and flanked by ornate helmets of fearsome warriors of a bygone era, I played a few hours of Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio's remake of historical Yakuza spin-off Like A Dragon: Ishin this week. The original was a Japanese-only release back in 2014 on the PlayStation 3, but what a fever dream it was to be dropped into Chapter 3 of the story and let loose on an Edo period Kyoto as none other than Ryoma Sakamoto (multiverse Kiryu). I almost cried, I raced chickens, I caught a big eel, and I've come away with a warm fuzzy feeling inside.\nFrom what I've played of the game's earliest portions, it's Yakuza through and through, to both its benefit and detriment. I don't expect it to convert those who dislike the series, but if you're a fan or a newcomer, it's looking like it'll both be a celebration of its cast, and a remake that feels like an old-school spin on the excellent Yakuza 0. In other words, the perfect introduction point to this mad, but beautiful action series. \nRead more",

He’s also handy around a toolbox and is more than familiar with high-risk equipment like the Plasma Cutter. Oh, and he’s remarkably good at slicing and dicing necromorphs into juicy squelchy lumps. What a resume!\nBut did you know that our favourite space engineer also has lots of secret talents too? When Dead Space originally came out in the back end of 2008, his corporate overseers at EA sent Mr. Clarke to do all sorts of odd jobs before he popped off on the believeable, but bleak USG Ishimiura. Golf caddy, professional skateboarder, even a part-time dragon slayer. Heck, he's recently been back on the second gig train with his stint in Fortnite just earlier this week. The poor dude is in desperate need of a vacation. Until then, though, come and marvel at Isaac's many talents and see what a hard worker he is.\nRead more",

They find life in the churn, and for some, it's an extremely lucrative prospect. Look no further than Fortnite, Call of Duty Warzone, or Genshin Impact for examples. Heck, even MMOs — which existed a bit prior to the prominence of live-service titles — could fall under this umbrella.

Naughty Dog is pushing the release date of The Last of Us Part I on PC back, from March 3 to March 28.\nIt's only a few weeks, but the extra time will give the Naughty Dog crew a little extra time to work on the port. The developer says it's noticed that players have been jumping back onto the story with the PS5 version of The Last of Us, and it wants to make sure the PC version puts a good foot forward.\n\"And so we want to make sure that The Last of Us Part I PC debut is in the best shape possible. These additional few weeks will allow us to ensure this version of The Last of Us lives up to your, and our, standards. We are so excited to bring The Last of Us Part I to a new platform, reaching new and returning players with Joel and Ellie's unforgettable story of survival, and we hope that you'll continue to look forward to its PC release on March 28.\"\n\nIt's not a long delay, but it does push the PC version a bit out from the finale of the HBO series. Episode 9, the last one for this season, airs on March 12. Now, rather than arriving just ahead of the finale, it'll debut a few weeks after.\nhttps://twitter.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1621539243402174470/\nWe are the last of us\nThough Last of Us fans on PC might be waiting a little longer, it at least give them a bit of time to decompress from the HBO finale. Given how emotional the series has been thus far, folks might need a minute to recuperate.\nThe Last of Us Part I now hits PC on March 28, 2023.\nThe post The Last of Us Part I PC release delayed further into March appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Okay, brain. Don’t accidentally write “First Blood.”\nVampires are pretty hot, but relationship options with them are limited. You know, because they’re fictional, which always gets in the way of good romance. However, First Bite is a visual novel that knows what we want: dates with vampires. This February 14th, we’re getting even more of that in First Bite: Bad Blood because if there’s one thing better than vampire dating, it’s more vampire dating. But there’s more than just one thing that’s better. Consider werewolf dating. Also, consider minotaur dating.\nFirst Bite: Bad Blood picks up where the base game left off, serving as a sequel that again follows Noe, a freshly-chomped vampire who is adjusting to being a cold-blooded dead person. But I’m going to have to quote the developer directly on this one, because I’m not sure I can really put it better myself: “things aren’t quite as simple as you hoped when you’re being eased into vampire life by a murder-himbo obsessed with Eurodance, a narcissist with an online shopping addiction, and a wild card with a penchant for BDSM.” Sounds magma-hot.\n[caption id=\"attachment_361381\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via First Bite Games[/caption]\nThis time around, just to make things spicier, you’re going up against the most arousing force in the universe: bureaucracy. A missed email is all it takes to put your destiny in question, as the vampire council is a bit miffed about being snubbed. Wow, I can hardly contain the lust boiling atop that overwhelmingly erotic plot summary.\nSarcasm aside, First Bite is an LGBTQ+ friendly visual novel with a dark comedy approach. I’ve been going through a bit of a dry spell when it comes to my digital romances, so I might just have to sink my teeth into this one.\nFirst Bite is available right now on Steam and itch.io, its DLC, First Bite: Bad Blood will hit Steam on February 14, 2023, and can be pre-purchased on itch.io for $4.99.\nThe post Romantic visual novel First Bite getting Valentine’s Day DLC appeared first on Destructoid.",

Why, after some successful genres reach a certain age, did the industry just collectively seem to move on? As with any art form, trends constantly emerge in the medium of video games. As is also common, we eventually circle back to the ones we fondly remember, and video games seem to be the most literal when it comes to that. It wasn’t enough for the side-scroller to reach a resurgence; the pixel-prominent visuals had to come with it.\nYet, we also live in an age where we are protective of our art.

          "description": "Running out of GAAS\nIf you’re keeping score on games going offline, you can add another tally mark. Smilegate Entertainment has announced that military shooter CrossfireX will be shutting down on May 18, 2023. This adds to a growing list of games-as-a-service titles that are being given the axe.\nWhat makes CrossfireX a bit unique in this regard, however, is that it has a single-player component developed by Remedy Entertainment. And despite that this is something that should not require an internet connection, once the servers go quiet, the campaign will be inaccessible, according to an FAQ from the developers. Note that the single-player wasn’t free, but apparently, the price paid wasn’t enough to ensure any effort would be made to divest it from the servers.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7yGkRV8Bl8\nWhenever a game is announced as “always online,” there tends to be a bit of nose-gazing where it’s suggested that it’s perfectly okay in the modern age of fridges connected to the internet. Well, where’s your God now? Maybe CrossfireX wasn’t the most whiz-bang revolutionary game, but this sort of thing could happen to any game that requires an internet connection for whatever reason. This includes some internet-dependent DRM solutions like Denuvo.\nTo add more poop to the pot, while CrossfireX is free-to-play in regards to multiplayer, it was supported by in-app purchases. Smilegate will refund all of these purchases… so long as they were made fourteen days prior to this announcement. I guess there needs to be a cutoff date, since even ephemeral experiences have a price tag, but considering this announcement comes less than a year after the CrossfireX’s release, it might be hard to swallow for some.\nSo, that’s your four-minute warning. Crossfire X is currently available on Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S, but it won’t be after May 18.\nThe post CrossfireX servers going offline May 18, including single-player appeared first on Destructoid.",

You can also design the restaurant itself, and even conjure up your own recipes to really put your eatery on the map. Dapper Penguin's release was well-received by critics on release, and is well worth a look for management sim fans or anyone who believes they're cut out for the non-stop, high-pressure world of foods and feuds.\nRecipe For Disaster will be available to download, free of charge, from Epic Games Store from February 9-16.

And because of that, it'll be leaving Back 4 Blood as it is, right now.\nIn a short update, Turtle Rock Studios confirms it's not working on any more Back 4 Blood content. Mostly, it's because the studio is working on its next game.\n\"Turtle Rock Studios is actually pretty small for a studio making AAA games. We don’t have quite enough folks to continue working on Back 4 Blood content while we spin up another game – yes, another game! Given this, it’s time for us to put our heads down, get back in the lab, and get to work on the next big thing.\"\n\nThis doesn't mean the game is shutting down, though. Back 4 Blood will stay online, and available on both Xbox Game Pass and the PlayStation Plus extra tiers. The developers also say they will continue hanging around in places the community congregates, like the subreddit and Discord, to keep interacting. The team may be \"quieter in the short term,\" but promises to be back.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piY-dwt4eCw\nDon't look Back in anger\nBack 4 Blood hit back in October 2021, as a continuation of Turtle Rock's legacy of co-op zombie FPS development. As the name suggests, it follows in the footsteps of Turtle Rock's work on Left 4 Dead. And though it didn't mark the same historic highs, I did enjoy my time with the new deckbuilding ideas and characters that Turtle Rock created for Back 4 Blood.\nThe Turtle Rock crew rolled out a pretty decent amount of expansions for Back 4 Blood, and now it gets to move on to something new. At the very least, it's a neat and clean conclusion, and it's staying online.

Grubb suggests that the team may have been pulled from all of the above projects to start working on Gears 6 — a continuation of the popular and hugely successful Xbox series.\nhttps://twitter.com/IdleSloth84_/status/1621186685873651712?s=20&t=8HHmV4uZcmpzHgcaWvhOBw\n\"This was all reflected in the layoffs that happened at Microsoft, which did hit The Coalition a little bit.

I say now, it has likely moved on to Gears 6 in full over the course of the last year, but definitely, that will be their next game.\"\nThe most recent mainline entry in the Gears series, Gears 5, launched on PC and Xbox One in 2019, and follows the story of former rebel outlier Kait Diaz, as she attempts to stem the flow of the Horde hivemind and uncover the roots of her own connection to the subterranean species. The sequel was praised for its impactful and visceral action, as well as offering another intriguing and dramatic chapter to the ongoing Gears of War narrative.\nWhile there has been no official word from The Coalition, it is common belief that the studio was expected to continue the Gears franchise at some point on Gen-9 hardware. Even if Grubb's sources are correct, it is unlikely that we'll be seeing Gears 6 rev its chainsaw bayonet anytime in the immediate future.\nThe post Rumor: The Coalition cans unannounced titles to begin work on Gears 6 appeared first on Destructoid.",

By doing so, you gain strength and extra powers that all you to help more of the island’s inhabitants. You play as Home, an “echo” possessing the corpse of a dead soldier. You’re given orders by an alien named Moon, who promises to help you reverse a curse that’s eating away at you. Or something. If none of that makes sense to you or you’re a visual learner, Happy Shabby Games has provided a trailer.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/L0FruNm42Wk[/embed]\nIt doesn’t take more than a cursory glance to see that 24 Killers takes a lot of inspiration from the games of Love-de-Lic and its offshoots.  Particularly, the 2D-from-3D art style reminds a lot of Moon: Remix RPG. Overlapping this is a quirky soundtrack, and while it’s no Hirofumi Taniguchi, it’s the right amount of weird and pleasant.\nBeing an incessant fan of Moon: Remix RPG and Chulip, it wasn’t difficult for 24 Killers to grab my attention. I’ve spent a not-insignificant gob of time with a pre-release build of it, and it’s about what I was hoping for. It nails the aesthetic and philosophy of Love-de-Lic’s joy-makers while still presenting something reflective of its creator. Love-de-Lic fans are the best people. Just look at how great I am.\n24 Killers launches on PC March 9th, 2023.\nThe post Love-de-Lic-inspired 24 Killers launches March 9 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Citing that the original message was posted \"in error\" Adams does reiterate that the listed 46 titles are being removed from sale as of February 7, but the remainder of the Xbox 360 Marketplace catalog will remain online.\nRegardless, it's a pretty intriguing error to make, given the definitiveness of the message, complete with a timeframe.

While Chimera is mostly known for its mobile games, such as Sacred Legends and Angry Birds Evolution, Songs of Silence will be a whole-fat PC game, and it’s looking rather interesting.\nSongs of Silence will feature narrative-driven, single-player campaigns on randomly generated maps. It features a fantasy world “torn between light and dark” and contains multiple sub-factions locked in an eternal war. There’s a mix of kingdom and hero management and real-time battles that sort of remind me of North and South. You don’t seem to take direct control of your forces in the midst of battle but instead play “powerful combat cards from your heroes.” There are more than a hundred different units, hundreds of cards, and six-person online multi-player.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/Zcrrvsb8P3M[/embed]\nWhile I can understand skepticism when it comes to seeing a primarily mobile developer entering the PC strategy scene, Songs of Silence looks like a real passion project. Chimera Entertainment cites Ogre Battle, Kohan, and Warlords as inspiration for this endeavor. Personally, I enjoy the kingdom management of strategy games. Even with something like the Total War series, my favorite part is the conquest rather than the individual battles.\nIf you need more to sweeten the deal, Hitoshi Sakimoto is signed on as the composer. He was responsible for the Final Fantasy XII, Final Fantasy Tactics, Valkyria Chronicles soundtracks among so many others. If nothing else, it demonstrates an earnest effort to live up to the classics.\nNo release date has been announced, but it is currently available to wishlist on Steam.\nThe post Songs of Silence is bringing its Kingdom Management to PC appeared first on Destructoid.",

While they initially looked to make an operating profit of 76.5 billion yen, they’ve slashed that forecast to 42.5 billion. That’s a rather sizeable difference, but the publisher isn’t really saying what the cause of it is.\nWhile I’m absolutely biting my tongue trying to speculate on the cause of Konami’s financial woes, people smarter than me suggest it probably has a lot to do with the disappointing performance of eFootball 2023. There is also no indication of when the multitude of recently announced entries in the Silent Hill series are going to drop. They might be planning a release outside the financial year in this report.\nHowever, I’m going to say it’s because they aren’t focusing on the Ganbare Goemon series. Clearly, a renewal of that series would shift mad loot into their coffers. At the very least, maybe less focus on trying to stand out in the mobile market. But what do I know? I’m not a financial bigwig, I’m just one of the people they’re trying to get the money out of.\nSeriously, though, this doesn’t mean Konami is financially imperiled.

We are a small team and things like this heavily impacts production.” We don’t often hear illness as a reason for delays in this industry, which is rather unfortunate, because it seems like a perfectly valid one considering our games are made by humans who have the tendency to fall ill.\nAmnesia: The Bunker is the latest game in the series that began in 2010 with Amnesia: The Dark Descent. In a big change to the formula, The Bunker includes both combat and a semi-open world map promising to present more of a sandbox horror game. Players will be stalked by an “ever-present gruesome creature,” and resources will shift in every playthrough. Sounds like another immersive sim for the growing sub-genre, and I welcome it.\n\nSet during WWI, the narrative follows French Soldier Henri Clement as he finds himself trapped in an abandoned military bunker. He then must find a way to avoid the aforementioned gruesome creature and escape. I’m not sure if returning to the frontline could really be considered an improvement, but I guess Henri can climb that razor-wire when he comes to it.\nAmnesia: The Bunker will be available on PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam, GOG, and the Epic Games Store on May 16, 2023.\nThe post Amnesia: The Bunker shaken by delay appeared first on Destructoid.",

This is expected to be due to the increased manufacture and availability of PS5 consoles in the latter half of the year, following the extended period of production downtime in the console's debut year, with both a lack of components and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic putting the brakes on the whole industry.\n\nAs a result of the increased shipment figures, Sony has raised its annual quarterly forecast for the remainder of the fiscal year. That is to say, the publisher now expects to ship a further 6.2m units worldwide in the current quarter, resulting in a grand total of 19m PS5 console shipments for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023.\nIn addition to the hardware shipment figures, Sony announced that it sold 86.5m software units (combined PS4 & PS5) during the three-month period ending December 31, 2022. This number is down around 6.2m units on the same period in the previous fiscal year (92.7m). Also continuing to decline are PlayStation Plus subscriptions, with a total of 46.4m subscribers recorded December 31, 2022, a decrease of 1.6m from the same period in the previous fiscal year (48m).\nOverall, however, PlayStation engagement is slightly up, with 112 million monthly active users on PlayStation Network, a one million user increase on the same period ending December 2021.\nThe post PS5 shipments pass the 32 million mark, quarterly forecast raised for March 31 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "You must be this Puyo to ride\nHere's a healthy dose of cuteness for your Thursday lunchtime, as Nintendo has released a colorful new trailer for the incoming release Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe, which will launch on the Switch platform later this month.\nThe trailer, titled \"Welcome to Merry Magoland\", invites us into the almost sickeningly adorable theme park, described by the enthusiastic narrator as an \"out of this world destination for general merry-making\". The theme park will provide Dream Land Deluxe players with a selection of fun mini-games, a few of which are new, while many of which have been recreated from their original appearance in some of Kirby's classic prior adventures.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJav9cmudMA&ab_channel=NintendoofAmerica\nThese multiplayer showdowns will include shooting galleries, bomb-tossing silliness, and even an amusingly stoic samurai showdown. The all-new \"Booming Blasters\" — essentially a Kirby-themed variant of the top-down carnage depicted in games such as Bomberman — looks to be a particular highlight. It's not all for naught, either, as while players enjoy games and explore the park, they will also earn stamps that can be traded in for new Copy abilities as well as various exclusive dress-up masks.\nKirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe launches exclusively on Nintendo Switch February 24.\nThe post New Kirby’s Return to Dream Land trailer spotlights ‘Merry Magoland’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

Having smashed through these numbers in just three months, Ragnarok is now officially the fastest-selling first-party PlayStation Studios title to date.\nhttps://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1620874605211848705?s=20&t=F_l2aT5A7PVSHkZAEIz7aQ\nEasily one of 2022's most anticipated releases, God of War Ragnarok is the follow-up to the dramatic and ambitious 2017 God of War \"reboot\". The sequel follows Kratos and his maturing son Atreus as the duo faces down the coming of Ragnarok — The cataclysmic event of Norse lore that is fated to bring death and destruction to the gods. Upon release, the sequel was praised by critics and fans for its suitably operatic storytelling, fantastic visuals, and compelling world of mythological Gods & Monsters.\nGod of War Ragnarok is available now on PlayStation platforms.\nThe post God of War Ragnarok smashes past 11 million global sales appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Earlier this week, we saw a new teaser trailer for The Super Mario Bros. Movie. The teaser gave us a glimpse of Cat Mario's appearance in the film, as well as Donkey Kong's reaction. Today, Universal, Illumination, and Nintendo released the official movie poster for the Super Mario Bros. Movie.\nIn this new poster, we get a cinematic glimpse of the cast of main characters that we know of so far, including Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad, Bowser, Donkey Kong, and Kamek. Additionally, we see the opposing worlds in the apparent conflict of the film, with the darkness of Bowser's Castle contrasted by the bright and joyful Mushroom Kingdom. While nobody quite matches Donkey Kong and Toad's wide-eyed and unbridled bliss, every character on the poster is at least sporting a smirk.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie features an all-star cast, including Chris Pratt as Mario, Charlie Day as Luigi, Anya Taylor-Joy as Peach, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, Jack Black as Bowser, Seth Rogen as Donkey Kong, and Fred Armisen as Cranky Kong. We also know that Mario's video game voice actor, Charles Martinet, will have a cameo in the film at some point.\nTo this point, the movie has only received character-focused posters on top of a teaser poster that preceded the initial movie trailer. If you missed out on those posters, you can see every other character and teaser poster released for The Super Mario Bros. Movie below.\n\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie arrives in theaters on April 7.

Roughly 50 people were on the team working on this game and EA will reportedly attempt to find positions for these employees elsewhere within the company. If positions cannot be found, some might be laid off with severance packages, according to Bloomberg. \n\n\nThe publication says Mohammad Alavi (Titanfall 2, Apex Legends designer) was set to direct this now-canceled game, but he left the company in 2022. \nIt's likely this canceled single-player game set in the Apex Legends and Titanfall universe was the one hinted at back in July in job postings that referred to the game as an \"Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title.\"\nWord of this cancelation comes shortly after EA announced it was shutting down Apex Legends Mobile and Battlefield Mobile, and shuttering the latter's developer, Industrial Toys, as well. Plus, in the same financial results where EA revealed it was shutting these games down, the company revealed that Respawn's upcoming single-player Star Wars game, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, had been delayed to April. \n[Source: Bloomberg]\nDo you think we'll ever get Titanfall 3?

          "description": "Sony's latest financial results covering Quarter 3 of Fiscal Year 2022, which consists of the last three months of the year, reveal the PlayStation 5 had its best quarter on the market yet. \nThe company has surpassed 32 million PS5 units shipped, sitting roughly at 32.1 million, after shipping 7.1 million during the last three months of 2022. It's important to note this isn't a sell-through number so theoretically, there could be consoles sitting on shelves still. But a company ships more units when the demand is there, so it's likely that the majority of these shipped consoles were sold. \nPlayStation did just as well on the first-party software side of things, selling 20.8 million during Q3 of Fiscal Year 2022, which is almost more than double the 11.3 million sold during the same period in 2021. Of those 20.8 million, roughly 11 million were of God of War: Ragnarok, which was the console's big holiday release. \n\n\nIncluding both first and third-party software, 86.5 million units were sold for the PS5, which is less than Q3 of Fiscal Year 2021 (92.7 million) but still an impressive number nonetheless. Sixty-two percent of the software sold this past quarter was digital. \nPlayStation Plus subscribers reached 46.4 million in Q3, which is up from Q2's 45.4 million but down from Q1's 47.3 million. The peak in the PS5's lifetime happened in Q3 of Fiscal Year 2021 at 48 million subscribers.\nIn terms of monthly active PlayStation users, Q3 reached a new peak for the current generation of PlayStation, hitting 112 million. That's up 10 million from the quarter before it and roughly 1 million more than the same quarter in 2021. \nAll told, Q3 of Fiscal Year 2022 was the PS5's best quarter yet. \nDid you pick up a PS5 this holiday season?

Sony didn't provide a reason for why it's closing the collection, but it also clarifies that other PS Plus perks, such as the monthly games, will not be affected. Here’s the full message below:\nThe PlayStation Plus Collection launched alongside the PS5 as an added bonus to those owners. In a way, it served as a mini-version of Xbox's Game Pass, albeit only featuring last-gen titles. The collection has remained largely the same since 2020, with a couple of titles joining the roster and only Persona 5 being removed from the original line-up last year. The PS Plus Collection currently consists of the following titles: \nBatman: Arkham Knight\nBattlefield 1\nBloodborne\nCall of Duty: Black Ops III: Zombie Chronicles Edition\nCrash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy\nDays Gone\nDetroit: Become Human\nFallout 4\nFinal Fantasy XV: Royal Edition\nGod of War (2018)\nInfamous: Second Son\nThe Last Guardian\nThe Last of Us Remastered\nMonster Hunter: World\nMortal Kombat X\nRatchet & Clank (2016)\nResident Evil VII: Biohazard\nUncharted 4: A Thief's End\nUntil Dawn\nLast year, Sony added two premium PlayStation Plus Subscription tiers that give those members access to a much larger (and more regularly updated) library of games across multiple generations of PlayStation. Premium members can access most, though not all, of these titles now, so perhaps Sony wants to incentivize standard PS Plus subscribers to upgrade. Regardless, be sure to nab these games now if you haven't already before the May 9 deadline sneaks up on you.",

Today, Iron Galaxy will close the in-game store and will release the final update. \nRumbleverse was first announced during the 2021 Game Awards and offered a unique spin to the battle royale with its emphasis on melee combat. After holding various beta tests throughout the first half of 2022, the game fully opened its doors in August to a generally warm reception from players and critics. You can watch us take it for a spin in this episode of New Gameplay Today Live. \nIn similar news, today Konami announced it's turning off the lights to its 2022 social deduction game, Crimesight.",

Instead of arriving on March 17, the game will now launch a little over a month later on April 28. \nIn a message posted to Twitter, Respawn states the game is content complete, and it's solely focusing on fixing bugs, ensuring stability, and polishing the experience as much as possible. The team is so committed that it’s taking another six weeks to make sure Survivor plays as smoothly as butter. Check out Respawn’s full message below (click the image to enlarge). \n\nStar Wars Jedi: Survivor takes place five years after its predecessor, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. Hero Cal Kestis, now a full-fledged Jedi, still fights to survive against the Galactic Empire alongside his allies BD-1 and Cere Junda. It will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

          "description": "Crimesight, a social deduction game released last year, got a surprising update on its steam page last night. Despite being out for less than ten months, Konami is ending support for it — and making the game unplayable.\n“Thank you for playing CRIMESIGHT,” the news post reads. “This service has continued to operate with the support of many users since its launch in April 2022, but due to various circumstances, we have decided to terminate the service on Monday, May 01, 2023 at 00:00 PDT.”\nSupport for an online game is bound to end at some point, but seeing the service cut off so quickly has many fans caught off guard. This is also the end of more than just the online modes. At the end of the post, Konami writes, “Also, the game itself won’t be able to play.” As a result, recent Steam reviews have a score of “Mostly Negative,” as players warn future buyers from purchasing a product that will soon be unplayable.\n【Important】 Service Termination Announcement\nhttps://t.co/v71WmsKCzE\nJanuary 30, 2023\nCrimesight is a multiplayer social deduction game set in a futuristic London. Moriarty's team seeks to commit a murder, and Sherlock's team tris to stop that from happening. While it was generally received positively by those that did play it, it didn't gain much traction. With only a handful of reviews on Metacritic and extremely low stats on SteamDB, a site that tracks concurrent player count, it's safe to say that one of Konami's \"various circumstances\" for canceling it is the size of its playerbase.\nIf you want to try it out, you've got until February to buy it, and until May before it stops working. If you want to try playing a different social deduction game, I've heard Among Us is good.\nDo you think Crimesight should stay on Steam? Let us know in the comments!",

However, Capcom and Crunchyroll Games are piling on with a new free-to-play mobile RPG called Street Fighter: Duel. If character collection games like Summoners War, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, and Marvel Strike Force appeal to you, Street Fighter: Duel sounds like it shares many elements with those popular mobile titles.\nStreet Fighter: Duel includes more than 40 Street Fighter characters for players to recruit with the objective of building a team from across the franchise. Each team consists of three fighters who can be leveled up and customized with new skins. These fighters, who include characters like Ryu, Akuma, Chun-Li, Cammy, and more, all feature signature abilities and can pull off various combos through real-time 2D RPG combat or auto-battle mode. In addition to taking on Shadaloo, players can also look forward to head-to-head combat against other players.\n\n\n\"Street Fighter has been an iconic game for generations, and we know anime fans love to go on exciting adventures with beloved characters,\" Crunchyroll Games general manager and Crunchyroll senior vice president of emerging business Terry Li said in a press release. \"We're excited to collaborate with Capcom to bring Street Fighter: Duel and its incredible roster of iconic fighters to anime and gaming fans alike.\nPre-registration for both mobile platforms is available now through the official website. Those who pre-register will be gifted free in-game currency when the game arrives. Street Fighter: Duel is set to launch on iOS and Android in February.",

Made up of multiple netherworlds, the underworld residents followed the bushido code of honor until a tyrannical regime took over to promote a code of destruction. A pair of unlikely allies must team up to stop this threat: a lazy samurai named Futo and a hyperactive otaku girl named Pirilika. \n\n\nDisgaea 7 boasts over 40 character classes, including four new ones: Maiko, Bandit, Zombie Maiden, and Big Eye. It also retains the 3D sprites introduced in Disgaea 6. New mechanics include Jumbofication, which turns characters into super-sized versions of themselves to inflict massive attack damage. Item Reincarnation lets you transform equipment and items into new forms, such as turning a weapon into a healing item. Auto-battles have been improved with deeper character customization. Now, your forces can stand a better chance against other players' troops in the new online ranked battles. \nUnlike Disgaea 6, a Switch exclusive at launch, Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtuless will be available on multiple platforms on day one.

Now, Dragon Ball Super is coming back, starting tomorrow. \nThe official Fortnite Twitter account posted an image of a Red Ribbon ship hovering over a portion of Fortnite's battle royale island with \"Fortnite x Dragon Ball Super\" on it this morning, alongside tomorrow's date.

It's time to prepare for a new release!\nOur lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:\nSoldier Boyz\nGLK Scott Adams Interactive Fiction games (C64 and ZX Spectrum)\nGLK Scott Adams adventures 1-12 (TI99/4A format)\nObsidian\nPink Panther: Passport to Peril\nPink Panther: Hokus Pokus Pink\nDriller/Space Station Oblivion\nHalls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II\nBesides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list. Maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long - otherwise, there are some demos of these games available on our website.\nAnd since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen notable changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.\nAs usual, we are not just adding support for new games. We are constantly working on improving the engines we already support and, in particular, we’ve seen some incredible work being done on the SCUMM engine. Yes, there are the usual bug fixes, but this time we are also adding a feature that helps playing the SCUMM games in a truly original fashion: Support for the original loading and saving dialogs within the GUI!\nSpeaking of truly original: Remember those old CRT displays we had back in the day? With ScummVM 2.7.0 you’ll be able to replicate this experience on certain platforms thanks to our new shader-based scalers. Go ahead and give it a try!\nAll testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.\nA detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.\nThank you very much for your support!
