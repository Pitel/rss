A little over a year later, the game's first DLC, 'Dimension Shellshock', is here to show that sometimes bigger is in fact better, and even more Turtle action is always a good thing.\nThis DLC comes as a rather solid package. Alongside several new character colour palettes (many of which come from a free update that launched alongside the DLC), there's also the addition of a brand new game mode, two fresh-faced fighters — Usagi Yojimbo (aka 'Miyamoto Usagi' in his original comics) and Karai (a mainstay of the 2003 animated TMNT series) — and a number of shredding original music tracks from composer Tee Lopes.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Everybody Do The Kiba-Dachi.\nDigital Eclipse, following on from Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection, is continuing its trend of going back to the past to rekindle the games that kicked ass. While the Cowabunga Collection was wrapped in comic book paraphernalia and finished with a lick of old-fashioned Konami, The Making of Karateka follows the clean and tranquil stylings of Atari 50: The Anniversary Collection, a package we commended for being so thoughtfully arranged.\nDigital Eclipse’s “interactive documentary” angle, thus far, has been somewhat pioneering, built with robust research, stuffed with original interviews, and showcasing unearthed and playable prototype materials. And, priced at a reasonable $19.99, there’s a good chance that anyone who sits down and actually sifts through everything in The Making of Karateka, from video interviews to superb audio commentaries, will probably spend more time with it than they do with most games, such is the attention span of today’s impulse buyers and the wealth of content on-board. Without even playing the games in the package, you can kick back and enjoy the story of how Karateka came to be, in alluring, personal detail.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

To make the upcoming event that bit more special, the weekend's splatting will not take place in a unique location as usual, but will instead see all eight Tricolor stages from previous Splatfests make a return.\nThe news was shared in a post on the Nintendo Japan website, before being shared to the website formally known as Twitter in a translated form by @OatmealDome. The full lineup of eight different stages even includes the special Scorch Gorge variant used for the earlier Zelda Splatfest, so this will be the perfect time to see the sights if you missed out on getting to visit the locations previously.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Another day of sun.\nBeing a Rune Factory fan has been a bit of a rollercoaster ride for the past several years. After Rune Factory 4 launched in 2013, the games went on hiatus for nearly a decade, with the fate of the series itself being pretty up in the air for most of that wait. Against all odds, and after a change in development teams and rights holders, Rune Factory 5 finally saw a release last year and… well, it had its issues. Despite the middling reaction, the developers evidently saw good enough sales numbers that they could justify greenlighting Rune Factory 6, and while we wait for them to finish that up, the team saw fit to re-release Rune Factory 3 to fill the gap. Rune Factory 3 Special shows its age here and there, but this is overall a strong entry in the long-running farm sim series—we just wish that more was done to take advantage of the opportunity to bring it to new hardware.\nRune Factory 3’s narrative opens on a rainy night with a monster falling from the sky and crashing to the earth below, alarming the residents of the town of Sharance. A girl quickly takes pity on the monster and brings it into her house, giving it a room to stay in and a bed to recover in, yet the monster is nowhere to be found the following morning and has instead been replaced by a mysterious boy (named Micah by default) who has a bad, convenient case of amnesia. Micah is given a spare home built right into the trunk of the great Sharance tree just outside town and his relaxing new life as a resident there begins while he slowly puts together the pieces of his past.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Rather, this is a game that's designed to unfurl slowly, bit by bit, over the course of several hours, and before we begin, developer Frame Break's CEO Joakim Hedström tells me they've shortened the game's opening sequence for this particular demo, just so they can get players right into the thick of things as quickly as possible. \nBut even on this whistlestop tour, there's plenty to dig into and delight in here - not least its gloriously bright and inviting colour palette (take that, Todd). I got to sample its farming, its wonderfully weighty mech exploration, and even indulge in a little bit of, well, powerwashing. Yep, PowerWash Simulator's influence was well and truly felt at this year's Gamescom, and I'm so very here for it.\nRead more",

          "description": "Sad news vis-a-vis playing Starfield on the Steam Deck: it runs like a slug, even on the lowest possible settings. And if you were planning to get it through PC Game Pass, that's another issue, as Game Pass games are locked down behind the fully Deck-incompatible Universal Windows Platform system. If the wonder of space depends on the it being a borderless infinity realm of endless possibilities, nobody told Microsoft.\nThere is a way, however, to sidestep both problems. Xbox Cloud Gaming will let you play Starfield on the Steam Deck at a steady (enough) 30fps, by streaming the game from Microsoft's cloud network direct to your screen - no Proton GE or Lutris launcher required. It still takes some setting up, but luckily, you’ve already clicked onto a step-by-step guide on how to do it.\nRead more",

          "description": "Ring the bell, everybody, it's time for another round of game developers telling players that they don't really understand what a \"game engine\" is. The spark this time is little-known science fiction adventure Starfield, which I believe we've reported on before. The game has a few obvious foibles - in my experience as a space pirate, NPCs sometimes struggle to navigate their surroundings, and then there are those stark disconnects between planetary surfaces and orbital space. Hiccups such as these have led a few players to wonder whether the game might work better using different technology, and in particular, the newer versions of Epic's ubiquitous Unreal Engine. Isn't Bethesda's proprietary Creation Engine, which the company have been updating since 2011, getting a little long in the tooth?\nYou'll find a lot of the discussion below this post from Digital Foundry boffin John Linneman on Twxter, which has attracted both gloating PlayStation fans (remember, Starfield is Xbox-only in console land) and a number of thoughtful replies from some fairly senior game developers. This conversation goes back a fair way, of course - people have been ragging on Bethesda for using \"the same engine\" for years. And there's a definite air of world-weariness to some of the developer responses.\r\n \nRead more",

By total coincidence - I promise you it's accidental, I was so pleased - I've been working on a \"land on no planets\" run of Starfield. The reasoning for this is as follows: people say that outer space is the worst part of the game, because it's just an irritating interval between the maps where the majority of quests, loot, intrigues, etc are found. It's a fast travel loading screen you can fly about in. But what if you double-down on the space stuff? \r\n\n\r\nWhat if you never descend from orbit, not even to repair, modify or upgrade your ship and offload inventory? What if, rather than buying new ships or building them, you progress exclusively by boarding other captains and making off with ship and cargo? How well does Starfield scrub up as a thoroughbred space sim that leans towards bloodthirsty piracy? Here to answer these questions is Mary Read, my custom character and budding astral freebooter. She's named for her distant ancestor, the legendary 18th century English buccaneer Mary Read. She's had a crack at life on shore, setting foot most recently on Earth's Moon, but from this point on, her fate and fortune lies amid the stars. Arrr!\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I don't have any firsthand insight to share on Void Stranger, which surprise-released on Friday, but when I read words like \"forgotten labyrinth\" and \"traps that defy reason\", I find myself reaching for my pen and inkwell, and when I encounter visuals that remind me of the nastier Zelda dungeons on Game Boy, I start vibrating gently in my chair, and when I see monochrome anime story scenes set to howling guitar and fuzzy chip tunes - well, here we are.\nVoid Stranger is the work of Finnish indie System Erasure, whose vertically scrolling shmup/mystery game ZeroRanger was one of Dominic Tarason's (RPS in peace) best games of 2018. The new title is a sokoban-style puzzle game, which is to say, it's broadly about shoving crates around, but as the name suggests, Void Stranger has bigger ambitions than helping you while away five minutes over lunch. It's a game of faith, amnesia and devilry, which reportedly portions out its secrets across multiple playthroughs. Here's a trailer.\n Read more",

          "description": "People have talked about Baldur's Gate 3 going a bit wonk in the final chapter when you reach the titular big city. It was actually my favourite act of the whole game - not that I doubt other people saw things going on the wonk a lot, but I did, thankfully, escape more or less unscathed (apart from one instance where, for some reason, Gale the smug sex wizard had a conversation with me, and then immediately repeated the exact same conversation). For me, the final act of BG3 is the act when all my nonsensing in the rest of the game paid off. The part where it turned out it did matter that I spent a painstaking hour separating and killing a bunch of guards in a mine, so I could save the gnomes trapped in a cave-in. It was also where a genie turned me into cheese.\nSpoilers, obvs, if you're that way inclined. \nRead more",

While Sayer the Space Scoundrel is having trouble getting around as they engage with the main story, I have started another character to engage in some nonsense (to the extent that there is any in Starfield) - the first of such I've detailed here.\nI've said it before, but you're my very best friend, so we're going to play Starfield together. Join me as we step, wobbly and uncertain like Bambi on ice, into Bethesda's huge and partially procedurally generated space RPG universe for the adventures of Turbo Eclipse (I used an astronaut name generator intended for a child's party), a spacefaring nerd who longs only for the thrill of science. Yes, we're going to visit every planet in Starfield. Or at least as many as possible before I lose every single one of my marbles. And hey, planets look kinda like marbles! Strap in, spacefarers.

          "description": "As someone with a general aversion to online competitive modes in games, I'm always grateful when someone, for once, especially in this age of endlessly bland multiplayer experiments, thinks of the solitary solo player. I'm especially grateful when us single player preferers get a knowing nod of acknowledgement in fighting games, too, which are so naturally geared toward pitting your skills against other human beings that anything involving playing against the AI is often either an afterthought or so threadbare that you can't help but feel like you're missing the point. \nBut that's still, for my sins, how I like to consume fighting games when I occasionally play them - which isn't often, I'll admit, for exactly the reasons described above - and so when I sat down for my Mortal Kombat 1 demo session at Gamescom this year, I was pleased to see not just a very slick story mode in attendance, but also a new single player challenge mode called Invasions that publishers Warner Bros described as \"a giant interactive board game\" that \"lent into action RPG\" territory. Its numerous node-based missions looked substantial based on what I played, and the idea of applying a seasonal service model to it, endlessly rotating in new locations and missions every so often - a whole different Invasion, so to speak - is actually something I'd be very much behind. It, that is, I was a) good at Mortal Kombat, and b) the missions I played during my demo weren't quite so… err… boring.\nRead more",

But once the credits rolled, I realised I had been fooled by its polished looks, and its core development was team was tiny (with a squad of external contributors), leaving me feeling a lot more forgiving.

So it is with Starfield, which already has a DLSS mod ready to patch in the class-leading Nvidia upscaler that Bethesda left out in favour of AMD FSR 2.\nIt’s the work of seasoned modder PureDark, previously seen hammering both DLSS and FSR into Skyrim. I’ve tried the Starfield mod and it works rather nicely, granting a visible quality boost on RTX graphics cards while equalling FSR’s ability to smooth out Starfield’s sometimes-tricky performance. Unfortunately (and largely by association), it’s also been dragged into a spot of nasty business, one involving a separate mod for DLSS 3 frame generation and PureDark’s application of DRM.\nRead more",

And, god, I hated it so much.”\nIt’s weird, in fact, that Gaider wound up working on Baldur’s Gate II at all - let alone that he became synonymous with Dragon Age and romanceable companions afterwards. At 27 years old, he ran a hotel in Edmonton, Alberta - the same city where, unbeknownst to him, Bioware was busy making its name. Once it came time to make a sequel to Baldur’s Gate, Bioware cast around for local writers, and a friend recommended Gaider, who had played D&D in the ‘80s before it fell out of fashion.\nRead more",

Well, at the risk of empirically demonstrating that romance is dead, it turns out all that might have been down to a technical problem.

Space sim fanatics were dismayed to learn that you can't actually fly down to the surface of the planets you're orbiting - instead, you hit a button to initiate a loading break and a landing cutscene, which makes outer space feel more like a glorified airlock chamber than, well, outer space. This segmented approach has prompted many unflattering comparisons with No Man's Sky, in which you can manually pilot through the atmosphere. \r\n\n\r\nPlayers and critics were similarly disappointed by the apparent inability to manually fly between planets in different orbits - instead, the game invites you to pick a destination from your star map or while using your spaceship's scanner HUD, with the journey condensed to a cutscene, again. Well, I bring news on this front. You can actually fly \"to\" and perhaps even \"between\" planets in Starfield. But there are some buts. Buts of astronomical dimensions. Onward!\r\n\n \nRead more",

Now though, DDR5 manufacturers are also producing an intermediate 24GB size, allowing for 48GB kits of two sticks each.\nThis new capacity requires a BIOS update for most motherboards, but pricing on it can be quite good - and that's what we're seeing today, with extremely rapid DDR5-6400 CL36 RAM available in a 48GB capacity for $130 after a $18 price drop.  \nRead more",

Verne Colon The Shape Of Fantasy is, at least in part, an adventure game, and weaker for it. Taken as 'pure' interactive fiction, it'd be shorter and simpler, but might allow its premise, atmosphere, and intriguing world to shine the way they ought to.\r\n\n\r\nThe premise actually takes some explaining. Jules Verne himself takes the place of Aronnax, the protagonist of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Seas, and instead of mere hermitry, his new submarine home/prison is devoted to a guerrilla war against The Nation, a Prussian-ish empire you might be able to stop using a techno-magical gubbins that allows you to edit reality.

          "description": "Earlier this week I attended a hands-off preview for Owlcat's forthcoming CRPG Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, which is shaping up nicely, inasmuch as there's anything \"nice\" about a Warhammer 40,000 game. Rogue Trader is a party-based affair in which you play a sort of Warhammer East India Company, tasked with flipping outlying worlds to the Imperium. In order to carry out this goal, you're granted a lot more individual license than most human residents of the 40K universe. You can, for instance, recruit ungodly xenos to your grimdark troupe, operate a private armada, and even colonise planets and turn them into your own personal piggybank. Just watch you don't push the whole \"heresy\" thing too far.\r\n\n\r\nI'll have more for you on the subject soonish, but here's an interesting advance snippet from my interview with Owlcat's creative director Alexander Mishulin, in which we discussed what really distinguishes a CRPG from other kinds of role-playing game. According to Mishulin, it's all about designing for choices with consequences that genuinely run the entire length of the game, without (somehow) getting lost in the narrative undergrowth.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "A quick heads-up for those of you hopping aboard the Starfield interstellar express today: there is a non-zero possibility that one of the game's elevators has a shark in it. That's according to Bethesda's head of publishing Pete Hines, who encountered the displaced piscine trouble-maker while playing the game before release. He's \"almost positive\" the shark isn't there any more - and just like that, my understanding of Starfield has been transformed. This isn't a 150 hour RPG treadmill of resource extraction, artefact investigation and base-building, wherein you give spaceship tours and put +5% on your accuracy, or what-have-you. It's an extremely slowburn horror game, with every innocent elevator potentially housing a Great White jumpscare. All of which, Hines feels, is true to how Bethesda \"embraces chaos\" in their games, though he does feel the company's popular association with jank and bugs isn't \"particularly fair\".\nRead more",

          "description": "After the Steam Deck and the Asus ROG Ally, it’s Lenovo’s turn to have a go at handheld gaming PCs with the newly-announced, Windows 11-powered Legion Go. It’s a chunky lad compared to its peers, weighing 854g and packing an 8.8in display, but promises a bigger battery and – most interestingly – a pair of Nintendo Switch-style detachable controllers.\r\n\n\r\nThese are partly intended to simply give your wrists a rest, setting the Legion Go down on its (also Switch-esque) integrated kickstand while you play with the loose controllers. The right pad, mind, also includes an optical sensor on the bottom, so you can swish it around a desk like a vertical mouse. Potentially a difference-maker for FPS games? We won’t need to wait long to find out, as the Legion Go is launching on October 31st. It’ll cost a surprisingly un-spooky £699 / $699.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I don't remember this at the time, but there were complaints about Skyrim's map when it came out, because it was just an extreme zoom out on the world. It wasn't dense with information; the map markers were often kind of an \"it's in this area\" guideline that were even less helpful if what you needed was in a barrow or otherwise underground. Starfield raises the bar by taking the bold step of having a map that is almost not a map.\nI'm referring here to the planet surface map. The starmap is, like a couple of things I've experienced since being hustled through quite an accelerated inciting incident (Starfield's equivalent of Patrick Stewart dying in a sewer after he's charged you with saving the world), reminiscent of Mass Effect. You can select different galaxies, which have one or two solar systems in them, and then can zoom down and select specific planets or moons or whatever to warp to. Once you're wombling about on the surface being a naughty little space captain - or whatever, I don't judge what you're up to - well baby, I hope you like blue voids with a bit of topography.\nRead more",

          "description": "Over the past week, dataminers have been rifling through Baldur's Gate 3's code and have discovered a dragon's hoard of alleged \"cut content\". It's hard to specify what they've unearthed without accidentally sounding the Major Spoilers trumpet and initiating Armageddon, but the supposed buried offerings include additional areas, swathes of dialogue, storylines, cutscenes, characters, romance opportunities and even deities. Given just how much Larian's gargantuan RPG gives you to play with, I am kind of thankful for a generous amount of stuff being \"left out\" - certainly, I don't need any more romanceable NPCs, I'm already fending them off with a broomhandle. But the news has gone down badly with a few players, and especially those who feel the game's overall quality takes a dive in acts 2 and 3.\r\n\n\r\nDevelopers have come to Larian's defence, amongst them David Gaider, former Baldur's Gate 2 and Dragon Age writer, who is nowadays creative director of Summerfall Games, creator of the very earwormy STRAY GODs: The Roleplaying Musical. \"Not surprised to hear of the amount of stuff apparently cut from BG3,\" Gaider wrote on Twix. \"BG2 had a mountain of stuff cut over its development, some early and some even after lots of work had gone into it... almost every game does. Every DA game did. Heck, even Stray Gods had some considerable cuts.\"\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's a part of the world we don't often get to see in games, and its stunning pixel art (and tiny cute little llamas) instantly caught my eye when I got to play an early mission from it at last week's Gamescom. Made by four developers spread across the globe, the official genres listed on its Steam page describe it as a tactical turn-based action adventure RPG where you guide four separate heroes in their fight against the ominous sounding Red Company. But just saying it's turn-based is doing Arco a disservice, I think, as it's also a little bit real-time, a little bit simultaneous turns, and all pretty brilliant, if you ask me. Here are some very early impressions of it.\nRead more",

It cast you as an ancient warrior, resurrected by a flying robot to reclaim humankind's old dominions together with their antique, storied weapons and gear. So much of its appeal for me, back in 2014, was the mystique of that reclamation process, bolstered by alternately zany, obnoxious, fragmentary or intriguing writing that expanded upon the viral mythological element in Halo. \r\n\n\r\nFast-forward nine years, and Destiny 2 has turned the destruction and loss of history wrought by the Darkness into a seasonal - or as it's shortly to become, \"episodic\" - content \"cadence\" (a term that stems from the Latin word for falling) of erosion and restoration, with areas, weapons and quests stripped periodically from the game due to a mixture of technical pressures and commercial priorities. It's sort of become the very thing you're fighting, but where the Darkness aims to engulf and extinguish the Guardians of the Light, Destiny wants to keep you engaged.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Released on Steam this week, The London Case takes young Poirot to, err, London, charged with protecting a famous painting along with a representative of the insurance firm. Naturellement, the painting is stolen from an apparently locked room under everyone's silly noses, and thus begins Poirot and Hastings' first puzzle caper together (for who else is our insurance representative?).\nTechnically, of course, they met in The Mysterious Affair At Styles, when Captain Arthur Hastings was on leave from the front during WW1, but one of the things I like about this series is how it takes what it wants and gently buffs away the rest. If you're going to adapt, then adapt! Like The First Cases, which came out in 2021, the game itself is largely a process of pointing and clicking through crime scenes to find clues, and then joining them in a big mind map akin to what you'd find in a Frogwares Sherlock Holmes game. But having Hastings along does make it a bit more fun, because his role is to be a bit of an idiot.\nRead more",

Immortal, which launched last year as a free-to-play MMO game, left quite a bad taste in our mouths when it launched on PC, especially when it came to the prohibitively high cost of its various microtransactions. Despite this, though, the game's continued to enjoy great success over on mobile, but even Blizzard weren't sure whether its popularity would last once Diablo 4 arrived.\n\"One of the things that we were kind of nervous about initially was that when Diablo 4 landed it would sort of cannibalise Immortal, and that everyone was just going to be, 'Oh we're just playing Immortal until Diablo 4 comes out',\" Fergusson told me at Gamescom. As it turns out, they needn't have been so apprehensive. \"In fact, it was the opposite,\" he says.\nRead more",

          "description": "When The Lord of the Rings: Gollum was announced a few years back, the general response was \"who on Middle-earth would want to play as Gollum\". I'm wondering if Atari and Graphite Lab's \"creative sequel\" to Pong will face a similar reception. Released in the 70s, the original Pong was videogame tennis. In this reinvention - which, confusingly, is also a sequel to Stuffed Wombat's Qomp, with the Pong branding sort of ladled on top - the homely pixel ball has shattered one player's paddle and escaped into an Axiom Verge-esque labyrinth of spikes, energy beams and floating T-Rex heads. Filing this premise somewhere on the \"what if\" spectrum between the Edge line about talking to the monsters in DOOM and people demanding to land on gas giants in Starfield. Find a trailer through the jump.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "You may have noticed a mounting squabble between Starfield fans and detractors concerning the game's planetary maps, triggered by some leaks or fake leaks over the past week. Said skirmish has now escalated to \"-gate\" status, with \"Tilegate\" doing the rounds on forums and even creeping into search results, presumably much to the alarm of innocent, unaligned ceramics company Tilegate Trading Llc in Florida. The nub of the dispute seems to be thus: some people claim the procedurally generated tiles that comprise many Starfield environments actually glue together into complete globes, so that you can see and walk from one to the other and, indeed, all around the equator, while others claim they're discrete maps with invisible walls, similar to those of the astonishing \"dreamable\" space sim Noctis. \r\n\n\r\nWho knows, we might have an under-embargo Starfield review in the works that will lay matters to rest. In the short term, the uncertainty about whether Starfield's planets are actually planets puts me in mind of comparable celestial angst in Bethesda's Elder Scrolls games, where planets are more properly described as planes of existence, conjured by immortal beings, which sort of orbit the mortal world of Tamriel. I've been revisiting how Bethesda's mainstay fantasy games thought about outer space in the run-up to Starfield, and while I'm intrigued by the new game's portrayals of celestial mechanics (latest discovery: the Starfield starmap represents stellar and planetary gravity as dimples on a kind of galactic tarpaulin, as in old Stephen Hawking documentaries), I'll be very surprised if it offers anything quite as wonderfully bizarre.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Nepromarněte proto příležitost vysondovat předem kdo na LinuxDays přijede a přijďte na Virtuální Bastlírnu prozradit téma Vašeho příspěvku! Samozřejmě, pokud si chcete nechat svoje téma až na LinuxDays jako překvapení, připravili si strahováci i zásobu novinek a zpráviček, o kterých si lze popovídat. Slyšeli jste třeba už o novém samozhášivém filamentu, MMU3, nové továrně TSMC v Evropě, Chameleonu Ultra, novém foťáku se SPAD senzorem nebo nových levných 12bitových osciloskopech?\r\n\r\nZe světa HW je tady bezdrátové kontaktní pole (ano, nejde o protimluv), nástroj pro montáž zápustných matek do plastu, USB-C tester, nové pokyny pro výrobu ENIG na plošných spojích či ukázka, jak vypadá výrobna flex plošných spojů.\r\n\r\nJako obvykle mají také bastlíři připravena témata nevážná. Vykopnout tuto rubriku lze postupem pro optimalizaci nadzvukového katapultu, ale mají i předražené chytré zámky od Applu, které otevře i batole, úsměvné varování před Flipper Zero (a jak se lidé baví tím, že RFID zařízení se považuje za více nebezpečné než samopal), sebevraždy tiskáren od Bambu Labs nebo Python v Excelu. Jako třešničku strahováci ukáží, jak došlo k \"teroristickému\" útoku na vlaky v Polsku (rychlokurz \"jak nedělat zabezpečovací zařízení\").\r\n\r\nPříští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve středu 6. září od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

It's always fun talking about the high-end server platforms, but at the opposite end AMD and their platform partners have been rolling out an equally interesting assortment of AMD Ryzen 7000 series based server products. With the Ryzen 9 7950X/7950X3D providing up to 16-cores / 32-threads, a growing number of Ryzen server motherboards supporting DDR5 ECC UDIMM, and a number of innovative Ryzen server platforms coming to market, it's an interesting time to be after a budget-friendly server platform or other robust rackmount systems where looking for power efficient 16 cores or less configurations.",

Several publishers and developers have already confirmed that they'll be making an appearance, including Capcom and Square Enix, to name a few. Sega and Atlus will also be teaming up to make a splash.\nTo watch the stream, tune in on September 21 at 19:00 (UTC+8). Their line-up is a jam-packed one, making it worthwhile to keep an eye out for them during the event. From Sega, you can expect the following games:\nSonic Superstars \nLike a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name\nENDLESS Dungeon\nAtlus will show off the following Persona games:\nPersona 5 Tactica \nPersona 3 Reload\n[caption id=\"attachment_402179\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Atlus.[/caption]\nTokyo Game Show 2023 has plenty planned\nSonic fans have had their eyes on Sonic Superstars for a while. It seeks to emulate the success of Sonic Mania, though it has adopted a little more modern art style while staying true to the gameplay of the classic titles. Persona 3 Reload's appearance at the show is also bound to raise some hype, as the upcoming game is a remake of the critically acclaimed Persona 3.\nAs you'd expect, Altus and Sega won't be the only ones at the show. Capcom has also confirmed that it'll be there, and we'll get to see more of Resident Evil 4 Remake's upcoming VR mode. Square Enix has a big line-up that includes oddballs like Power Wash Simulator and highly anticipated games like Dragon Quest Monsters 3: The Dark Prince.\nAlthough the AAA headliners will naturally grab the most attention, indies haven't been neglected, and Sony will be showing off indie titles at the event.

And then there are the weird updates that add a mix of obscure titles that seem to exist as curiosities at best. This month's update maybe veers closer to that second camp, but it’s such a crazy mix of games that I mostly feel confusion over any kind of disappointment.\nAcross the Game Boy, NES, and SNES apps, Switch Online owners can now access three Japan-exclusive titles and, weirdest of all, an obscure licensed game.

And the trial of Chrono Trigger did not disappoint.\nIt's not an overstatement to say Chrono Trigger has had a profound effect on the general gaming landscape.

          "description": "Atari has announced that the next game getting a physical Atari XP release is 1978’s Outlaw. This game is one of the first created by legendary video game pioneer and Activision co-founder, David Crane. The Limited Edition of Outlaw is coming to the Atari 2600 platform just in time for the release of the Atari 2600+.\nOutlaw is technically based on the 1976 arcade game of the same name, but it’s completely different. Some say the Atari 2600 version is a port, but I don’t see it. The arcade game involves drawing a gun when the onscreen character does and firing quicker than it. The Atari 2600 version is Combat with cowpokes.\nHowever, Outlaw was a pretty early staple for competitive console owners. Unlike in the arcade, the 2600 version was two-player, and that was the best way to play it. It kind of sucked to play it on your own.\nDavid Crane would leave Atari with some other developers, as they didn’t like Atari’s policy at the time when it came to crediting their developers (they didn’t). They founded Activision, where Crane created some classic titles, including Pitfall. Crane then left Activision near the end of the ‘80s because of a disagreement with the new CEO. He then moved around to different developers to create titles like A Boy and His Blob for the NES and assist with games like Night Trap.\nThe Outlaw Limited Edition is coming to the Atari 2600, and is available for preorder now for anyone in the US for $49.99.\nThe post The next 2600 game from Atari XP is David Crane’s Outlaw appeared first on Destructoid.",

Publisher Annapurna Interactive's own Annapurna Animation is working on an animated adaptation of the material. The feature is in development, and it won't be the last from the studio's library to receive such treatment.\nAnnapurna shared an update on its creative leadership, including the addition of Nimona co-director Nick Bruno and producer Julie Zackary. The only other project listed for development is Foo from Oscar-winning director Chris Wedge (Bunny, Ice Age). \nThere isn't much in the way of further info on the adaptation of Stray. Beyond mentioning it as part of the slate, the press release says there are plans to \"adapt more titles from their extensive Annapurna Interactive library.\"\n[caption id=\"attachment_401984\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot via Annapurna Interactive[/caption]\nThe cat's pajamas\nConsidering Stray's relatively brief length, it seems like a solid fit for a film adaptation. BlueTwelve's futuristic feline fantasy launched on PlayStation consoles and PC in July 2022 before heading to Xbox platforms in August 2023. It garnered a lot of positive attention along the way. The story follows a stray cat as it prowls the streets of a walled city and attempts to unravel its mystery with the help of trusty drone B-12. How well the film will capture exploring a decaying cybercity through the eyes of a cat remains to be seen. \nAnnapurna announced the launch of its animation division in December 2022, with former Disney Animation execs Robert Baird and Andrew Millstein on board. While we wait for more on Stray, you can catch the studio's adaptation of ND Stevenson's Nimona on Netflix. \nThe post Stray has animated adaptation in the works at Annapurna Animation appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A remake of 1994 arcade game Snow Bros. 2: With New Elves has been spotted as part of the Tokyo Game Show lineup as Snow Bros. 2: Special. New details have started to creep out since then.\nWe don’t know much. However, the Tokyo Game Show site lists the game as being for Switch and Steam. Also, if you zoom in on the promo image there, you can see that the remake is being developed by CRT Games, which isn’t surprising since they also handled 2022’s Snow Bros. Nick & Tom Special, a remake of the first game. Even though I reviewed it, my mind is such a blur, even though it came out last year.\nAccording to CRT Games’ website, Snow Bros. 2: Special will add four-player co-op, new levels, and a “Monster Mode” to remix things. On top of that, the art style has been tweaked. It’s similar to the style used for Snow Bros. Nick & Tom Special, which I wasn’t particularly a fan of. It’s not bad, just not very imaginative, either. I doubt they’ll bring back the horrifying toddler pictures from the character select screen, but we can hope.\nA Snow Bros. 2 remaster is definitely welcome, though. The title never reached North American arcades, nor has it been ported to console before, so I’ve never had the chance to play it. Both games were developed by Toaplan originally and are single-screen arcade titles similar to Bubble Bobble. Snow Bros. Nick & Tom Special was a competent remaster, but the game was just mostly okay to begin with.\nSnow Bros. 2: Special is currently only slated for Switch and PC. No release date has been mentioned, but CRT Games does state that it will be coming worldwide.\nThe post Information has begun to creep out on a Snow Bros. 2 remaster for Switch and PC appeared first on Destructoid.",

Star Ocean: Second Evolution for the PSP already added one that probably would have worked just fine here. However, Square Enix seems to be pulling out all the stops for this remake.

I'm also amazed that, nearly four years after the Switch version's October 2019 release, the publisher is still patching the game intermittently. This newest hotfix involves ambient audio issues, which should now be cleared up.\nThe hotfix addresses ambient audio issues\nHere's the full statement from CD Projekt Red, via the Witcher game franchise's Twitter account:\n\"We have just released a hotfix for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt on Nintendo Switch! It fixes the issue of ambient audio being absent for some players and resolves any regional restriction that was incorrectly applied on the Korean version of the game 🇰🇷 Be aware the game version won't change so if you are unsure if it has applied please check the date of the last update.\"\n\nIt's a small fix, but it's appreciated regardless! This port was a miracle in any context,\nOther recent Witcher news mostly involves collector's items\nBeyond that patch, there isn't much to report on The Witcher front, other than that it might be a while until we see any more games from CD Projekt Red.\nA Geralt bust figure is up for pre-order now, as well as a Ciri collectible.

The PC version received its share of optimization and bug fixes, as well. Among the performance boosts on consoles is a solid 60 FPS in Performance Mode thanks to GPU and CPU optimization and disabling Ray Tracing. Those who prefer to play in Quality Mode should notice positive changes like reduced FPS fluctuation. \nThe Jedi Survivor update also adds some other console-specific improvements, like Variable Refresh Rate support for PS5. On PC, support is in place for DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) image rendering tech along with \"additional performance & optimization improvements.\" \n[caption id=\"attachment_401926\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot via EA[/caption]\nCorruption like yours must be eradicated\nBeyond the visual and performance tweaks, Patch 7 addresses some notable bugs. This includes tweaks to the save system aiming to prevent the corruption of game saves. Issues that previously left players unable to retrieve XP after dying under \"certain circumstances\" have also been fixed. Some of the other bugs and improvements addressed cover cloth, lighting, and UI fixes across all platforms. \nThis update comes relatively hot on the heels of Patch 6.5, which arrived on July 18, 2023. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is currently available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. Even in its initially buggy state, Respawn's latest has garnered plenty of acclaim since its April 28 launch.

As if to help get you in the spacefaring spirit, Microsoft has made a Starfield “dynamic” background available for Xbox Series S and Series X users, and … it’s effectively a JPEG. \nIt should be said that the dynamic background looks cool — it’s the cover art of Starfield — but “dynamic” isn’t the first word that comes to mind. It’s wholly unlike the dynamic background available through syncing the official Starfield Xbox controller. That background features galactic lines moving ever-so-slightly across the screen. \nIf, despite this, you’d like to acquire this new background for yourself, start by jumping into your console’s settings. Then head over to the personalization menu, and navigate to your collected backgrounds / dynamic backgrounds. It’s here you should see the new “dynamic” Xbox theme. \nAll things considered, the new “dynamic” background might be one of the only things in Starfield considered static. Destructoid’s Steven Mills awarded Bethesda’s latest with an elusive 10-out-of-10, saying, “Starfield is an epic sandbox open-world RPG with a beautifully immersive universe, a captivating story, and fun and compelling gameplay the whole way.”\nWhen does Starfield Launch?\nStarfield is out now via Xbox Game Pass for players with the premium edition upgrade. For those without, the game formally launches on September 5.  If you want to jump in immediately, Starfield launches at 8:00 p.m. EST / 7:00 p.m. CST / 5:00 p.m. PST. So, begin the countdown … and take off into parts unknown. \nThe post Starfield “dynamic” backgrounds now live on Xbox appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "EON, the makers of the GCHD and Super 64 HDMI adapters, are primed to release the next one in their lineup, this one for Microsoft’s original Xbox. The XBHD will be released October 10, 2023.\nIt’s something of an obscure fact that the original Xbox supported HD resolutions like 720p and 1080i, making it one of the first consoles to do so. However, getting these resolutions required an “HD Pack” box or a third-party component cable. Since then, fancy-pants homebrew people have been able to get the signal through HDMI via various adapters and cables. However, the quality of all the above (aside from the official HD Pack) is generally shaky. Some are really good, but the majority of them leave a lot to be desired, and it can be hard to distinguish the two.\nEON was one of the first to create a viable HDMI adapter for the GameCube, which uses proprietary technology for its digital output. Their adapters are a little expensive, but they’re also some of the best quality available. The XBHD supports all the original Xbox’s native resolutions, has two output ports (useful for capture and streaming), and also three ethernet ports to connect with other Xbox consoles in a LAN configuration without needing a router. Nice.\nThe downside is that this unit is going to cost $189.99 USD. That’s pretty steep, especially for a unit that doesn’t seem to have any upscaling or line-doubling features for lower-resolution games. On the other hand, I’m planning on buying a Retrotink 4K when it launches, so I might be set for all my upscaling needs. But still, that’s going to be around $250 in Canadian Loonies. Woof.\nIn any case, if you have the spare dosh, the XBHD will be available from various retailers on Oct. 10, 2023.\nThe post EON set to release XBHD HDMI adapter for original Xbox on October 10 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Outlast would eventually launch on September 4, 2013, which makes it ten years old. Doesn't time fly?\nhttps://twitter.com/TheRedBarrels/status/1698757826599166217\nAs for the pitch trailer, it sells what this horrifying experience would eventually encapsulate, and evidently, it worked.\nBack when we were so young\nNow that we're three games in (four, if you count standalone DLC Whistleblower), it'll be interesting to see where Red Barrels takes things next. The series is known for its terrifying night-vision aesthetic, disturbing themes, and enough gore to make Tarantino faint. While it follows in the footsteps of Amnesia: The Dark Descent, Outlast released at a time when horror was going through something of an identity crisis.\nNow, the genre is fit to burst with plenty of indie and mainstream titles to choose from. The early access release of Outlast Trials is doing well on Steam, although it does lean into co-operative play.\nMany of you will no doubt recall your first time creeping around the asylum in the first installment.

Assassin's Creed Mirage, Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Ghostrunner 2, and Lords of the Fallen are just a few on the calendar. It's a busy month for any game, much less a legacy horror title looking to grab a firm foothold. \nIt remains to be seen just how alone THQ Nordic and developer Pieces Interactive will remain. There's still time for more big titles to slot in January 2024 plans, after all. In the meantime, you can see more footage of Alone in the Dark in the recent teaser. The latest take on the survival horror series that's been around since 1992 will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. \nThe post Alone in the Dark reboot delayed to avoid competing with October rush of games  appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Aside from being a critically acclaimed series with praiseworthy writing, The Last of Us is also one of the best TV shows adapted from a video game. As such, more than a few people have hoped for a third entry in Naughty Dog's harrowing, post-apocalyptic franchise. But it appears we shouldn't expect to hear anything about it anytime soon.\nIn a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly, game director Neil Druckmann makes it clear that he's not in a position to divulge information about a third game right now. When asked, he simply smiles and says that he's unable to \"say anything\" at this point.\n\"My comms director over there will slaughter me,\" Druckmann explains.\n[caption id=\"attachment_401794\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"] Image via Naughty Dog/Steam.[/caption]\nIt doesn't really get much clearer than that. While Druckmann did write an outline for a new The Last of Us story, Naughty Dog appears to remain quiet about whether it's in development or not.\nSeason 2 is almost ready to go\nAlongside this, Druckmann and the team working on the HBO adaptation are preparing for the next season. He says they've \"outlined all of season 2\" and are ready to film when the ongoing Hollywood strikes end.\nWith the recent TV show, the remake, and the upcoming Halloween Horror Night haunted walkthrough at Universal Studios Orlando, The Last of Us is very much keeping itself in the limelight.\nIt seems like it would be a missed opportunity if Naughty Dog decided not to do a third entry. While Druckmann's words suggest something is in the pipeline. It's just too early to say anything about it right now.\nThe post The Last of Us director remains tight-lipped about a third entry appeared first on Destructoid.",

Publisher Selecta Play announced plans to launch the action game on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam. You can see some of its 2D art style in action in the announcement trailer.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1h-w1ImzLk\nBack in the day, it was mostly game advertisements that told players they sucked. In Morkull Ragast's Rage, however, the hero of the story is a villain who is well aware they're in a video game. That means Morkull is also aware of you and the devs that brought him to life. The trailer doesn't show much of the fourth wall destruction that serves as one of the key hooks, but we know the God of Death and Darkness loves quips and pop culture references.\n[caption id=\"attachment_401691\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot via Selecta Play[/caption]\nBad 'tudes \nIt sounds like Morkull's communication with players may go beyond a sprinkling of bad jokes here and there. Selecta Play mentions \"a touch of exploration\" in addition to platforming and action, so maybe he'll keep us all from getting lost along the way. As someone who gets turned around easily in games, I can only dream. \nFrom sketches to inks and animation, the art in Morkull Ragast's Rage is completely hand-drawn, with \"traditional animated films and other two-dimensional video games\" providing the inspiration. It's currently available to wishlist on Steam with more info on the date to be announced later.

Following its announcement in June 2022, the sequel is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and Steam. The digital launch is still penciled in for sometime in 2024. \nIn addition to the brawling of the first game, Best of Both Worlds is gearing up for a roguelite twist. Complete with light RPG mechanics, this one lets you beat 'em all up on your own or online with up to four players. Developer Hero Concept is aiming for eight playable characters, duking it out against over 40 different enemies. \n[caption id=\"attachment_401682\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot via Hero Concept[/caption]\nTime after time\nFor those of you who come to brawlers for the story, this one is a real time-bender. The dual narratives are set 20 years apart, one following Stronghold agent Stellar and the other following She Wolf. As the parallel worlds unfold, the time-splitting teams will dig into one Mayhem City's darkest secrets. Look, when you call your city \"Mayhem City,\" you should expect a self-fulfilling prophecy or two.\nWith roguelite elements in place, Hero Concept promises new experiences for each playthrough. The devs are also hoping to boost replayability with \"rich endgame content,\" with player choices shaping the outcome. Whatever those choices may be, they'll play out through hand-drawn art and animation with inspiration (and a '90s vibe) from comics.  \nWe can't leap through time like the leads of Mayhem Brawler II: Best of Both Worlds, so we'll have to wait for further details on launch specifics. \nThe post Beat ’em up roguelite hybrid Mayhem Brawler II reveals platforms appeared first on Destructoid.",

Much of this longevity can be attested to the modding community, and there's one that will definitely appeal to you roguelike fans.\nRecently, a trailer for Doom Infinite was uploaded to YouTube. The footage, complete with a metal-ized version of E1M1, shows what you can expect in this mod by difficultoldstuff.\nhttps://youtu.be/kEIDEsTIowA\nFeaturing an \"endless cycle of death and rebirth,\" you're asked with plunging into a \"twisted spiral of never-ending death and bloodlust.\" Not only does it have roguelike elements, it also implements new powerups, weapons mods, and possibly more.\nAs if Doom wasn't fast-paced already\nMore details about Doom Infinite can be found over on ModDB. It's not fully out yet, but you can download the demo/early access version for now. The trailer alone really sells the insane action and violence, and the OG game is already pretty insane and violent. Just a note to say that it's for GZDoom specifically, so you'll need to make sure you have that installed.\nAfter nearly 30 years, it's hard to imagine that Doom is still very much in the gaming limelight. Mods are constantly being made for both the first and second installments of the legendary series.\nBasically, when it comes to Doom Infinite, if you like classic shooters mixed with Binding of Isaac-style roguelike elements, then this one should be right up your alley. And if it's not, well, there's three decades' worth of custom mods to sift through.\nThe post This Doom 2 mod turns the iconic FPS into a high-octane roguelike appeared first on Destructoid.",

Instead of inviting players back to Derceto on October 25, the survival horror adventure will now arrive on January 16.\nIn a press release, developer Pieces Interactive offers a candid explanation for the move: it doesn’t want the game to compete with October’s heavy hitters like Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and another big horror game, Alan Wake 2. \n“Our intention is to avoid competing with the wake of Alan's epic release and to evade the dazzling skyline of cities adorned by the graceful swings of Spider-Man,\" Pieces writes. \"We aim to truly remain as Alone in the Dark as possible. To honor this, the spine-chilling horror game has been rescheduled to unveil its horrors on January 16th, 2024. This extension will serve a dual purpose: not only will it permit us to meticulously perfect the gaming experience, but it will also grant us the opportunity to fully immerse ourselves in the remarkable releases of October.”\nThe studio also released a new trailer starring David Harbour’s Edward Carnby, one of the game’s protagonists, showing off his performance and impressive facial capture. \n\n\nAlone in the Dark is a modernized revamp of the 1992 survival horror classic that stars actors Jodie Comer and David Harbour as protagonists Emily Hartwood and detective Edward Carnby, respectively. Players control one character to explore the haunted Derceto hospital to solve a sinister mystery, with both scenarios offering different story threads and moments.

I saw, noticed, and felt things I hadn’t in any other, and it’s given me a new appreciation for Yu Suzuki and Sega’s AM2 development team.\nMore than anything else, Shenmue is a video game about how a real person in a real world inhabited by other real people experiences the death of a loved one and the loneliness that follows.\nIn the fall of 2020, my wife and I lost a baby…",

I’d spent the first few minutes referring to it as a sequel, but he clarifies, \"It’s not Hyper Light Drifter 2. It’s a follow-up, meaning that it’s an installment in the franchise of Hyper Light. So it’s a different game, different protagonists, different gameplay.\" After getting the chance to learn more about the game and see it in action, this distinction makes a lot of sense. For me to call it a sequel was misleading, given how different the games look and play.\nBreaker is a 3D rogue-lite with a strong emphasis on multiplayer.

It also highlights that parts of the game are playable as an isometric, third-person shooter like last year’s Signalis and as an over-the-shoulder third-person shooter like in Capcom’s recent Resident Evil remakes. \nCheck out the Holstin gameplay reveal trailer for yourself below: \n\n\n“A psychological survival horror game set in an eerie, isolated 90’s Polish town consumed by an ominous presence,” the Holstin Steam page reads. “You’ve come looking for answers, but everyone seems possessed by something foul. Explore the festering town, interrogate locals, and fight ungodly manifestations to get to the truth.” \nThere’s no release date in sight for Holstin, but you can try the game for yourself today through a demo available on Steam right now. \nHolstin is set to release one day on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.\nFor more scary games, read Game Informer’s list of the top 10 horror games to play right now, and then read our list of the top 25 horror games of all time after that.",

It’s the second action title from Gato Roboto developer Donksoft and we now know it’s coming on September 13. \nA new trailer provides a new look at Gunbrella’s explosive, retro-inspired action. Players control a woodsman seeking revenge for the death of his wife, with players using their weaponized umbrella to blast apart foes or as a platforming tool. For example, you can use the umbrella to glide, swing, or slide around levels, among other uses.\n\n\nWe went hands-on with Gunbrella’s Steam demo and walked away impressed. You can watch us give it a spin in this episode of New Gameplay Today. \nGunbrella will be available on Switch and PC.",

I’m roughly 23 hours in, so I still have many galaxies ahead of me, but read Game Informer’s Starfield review for in-depth thoughts on the overall package. With years of build-up and anticipation, I, like many Bethesda Game Studios fans, let my imagination run wild with what this new open world RPG could be. Now that I’ve played a decent chunk of it, it’s quite different from the studios’ Elder Scrolls and Fallout series in some ways. Those two franchises are significantly more open world than Starfield. In fact, Starfield feels more like a great sci-fi theme park with exciting points of interests rather than an open world adventure. But players looking for a replica space-based Fallout or Elder Scrolls adventure might …",

Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign. Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. \nAfter 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.\nJoin editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up. \nPart 1 - Surpr-iced! \nPart 2 - Bringing The Smoke\nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

It also revealed that each subscription tier of PlayStation Plus is getting a significant price bump.\nThe PlayStation Blog reveals that September’s free games will be 2022’s Saints Row, Black Desert - Traveler Edition, and Generation Zero. They’ll become available on September 5 and can be downloaded until October 2.\nOn September 6, 12-month subscriptions for PlayStation Plus Essential, Extra, and Premium will be raised to the following prices:\nEssential - $79.99 (from $59.99)\nExtra - $134.99 (from $99.99)\nPremium - $159.99 (from $119.99)\nYou can read this article for a refresher on the benefits of each subscription tier, which will not be changing. Current 12-month subscribers will not see these prices take effect until their next renewal date occurring on or after November 6. Changing your membership (such as buying more time or upgrading/downgrading tiers) on or after September 6 means paying the new prices, though. Sony also states that the new prices remain at a discounted rate compared to the single or three-month options. Sony has not revealed the new monthly/quarterly rates.\nIn the blog post, Sony explains the changes by stating, “This price adjustment will enable us to continue bringing high-quality games and value-added benefits to your PlayStation Plus subscription service.” It’s worth noting that, for now, Sony has not announced any new, additional benefits following the pricing updates.\nThe move comes at a time when several streaming and subscription services have raised their fees, so it’s not entirely surprising.

Front Mission 1st: Remake hit last November, and now, nearly a year later, we finally know when Front Mission 2 will arrive.\nThat date is October 5, following a delay from it's previously announced June 12 launch. Front Mission 2’s revival is significant because it has never been released outside of Japan, originally hitting shelves in 1997. Set 12 years after Front Mission 1st, it stars Ash, an O.C.U. soldier who tries to escape the nation of Alordesh after its overrun by a revolutionary group, only to discover a broader conspiracy. Check out its story trailer below. \n\n\nThe remake’s features include improved loading times (addressing a big criticism of the original version), free camera movement, a revamped soundtrack, new coloring/camouflage options, and additional language support. \nFront Mission 2: Remake will be available for $34.99. To keep up with every major upcoming remake, be sure to visit our complete list of them here.",

Bethesda announced the new IP way back in 2018 and after more than five years of waiting, it’s set to launch on Xbox Series X/S and PC next week, on September 6. Based on what Bethesda’s revealed about the sci-fi RPG, it looks set to be the developer Bethesda Game Studios’ biggest game yet. Hitting up its hundreds of planets while fighting space pirates, marines, and more will also require a decent PC build. \n\n\nHere are the PC specifications for Starfield: \nMinimum: \nOS: Windows 10 version 21H1 (10.0.19043)\nProcessor: AMD Ryzen 5 2600X, Intel Core i7-6800K\nMemory: 16 GB RAM\nGraphics: AMD Radeon RX 5700, NVIDIA GeForce 1070 Ti\nDirectX: Version 12\nStorage: 125 GB available space\nAdditional Notes: SSD Required\nRecommended: \nOS: Windows 10/11 with updates\nProcessor: AMD Ryzen 5 3600X, Intel i5-10600K\nMemory: 16 GB RAM\nGraphics: AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080\nDirectX: Version 12\nNetwork: Broadband Internet connection\nStorage: 125 GB available space\nAdditional Notes: SSD Required\nAs you can see, not only is Starfield a large game, needing 125 GB of free space, but it will also require that much space on an SSD. And you’ll want a pretty powerful graphics card and processor to run it at its best, too. \nStarfield hits Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Game Pass on September 6. However, if you preorder the Digital Premium Edition, the Premium Edition Upgrade (which you can purchase if you plan on playing the game through Game Pass), or the Constellation Edition, you can hop into the game up to five days early, starting August 31. \nWhile waiting for the game to launch, check out the Starfield Direct from earlier this summer for more than 40 minutes of footage and check out this special edition Starfield Xbox Series X console wrap afterward. \nAre you picking up Starfield early or jumping in on September 6?

Who is Breaker? He’s a sheriff, but that’s all we know for now. However, the fact that he shares a name and occupation with Bright Falls sheriff Sarah Breaker from the first Alan Wake seems more than coincidental. In a video message posted to Twitter by Alan Wake 2 creative director Sam Lake, Ashmore expressed his excitement to work with Remedy again and to play the sequel as an Alan Wake fan himself. \nThe brilliant actor and our good friend, the legendary @ShawnRAshmore plays Tim Breaker in ALAN WAKE 2.

On the first day of the new season this month, around 100 pirate service 'violations' were reportedly identified, but none were blocked. According to an inside source, Italy's \"insane\" blocking system isn't quite ready, but will \"solve digital piracy\" early October latest.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

These versions were produced by Tetraedge and are built on a completely different engine than the original Windows versions; basically, they are reimplementations, not ports. Now, thanks to the folks from ZOOM-Platform, you can easily obtain these game variants.\n>",
