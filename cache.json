From offering a unique world in the first game to adding co-op in the second, it has always tried to shake things up for the action-RPG genre. Cat Quest III feels like another switch-up for the series, taking what felt great about previous games and seeking to tell a charming pirate adventure that keeps you surprised. After sinking 15 hours into The Gentlebros' latest adventure, it is safe to say everything about Cat Quest III is fantastic.\nThe adventure began with us choosing our feline Purrivateer and arriving in the Purribean, an archipelago filled with Pi-rats to defeat who are on the hunt for the North Star Treasure. With our spirit companion, who is also searching for the North Star Treasure, we piloted our ship and ventured across land and sea to find the mythical treasure, defeating Pirate Lords in a variety of dungeons and uncovering a myriad of secrets along the way.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

In fact, this is probably one of the more well-known codenames in console history, aside from maybe the 'Revolution' for the Wii and the 'NX' for the Switch.\nA prototype of the GameCube had been known to exist, but the only photo of the fabled device was so blurry it could have potentially passed as a UFO or Bigfoot sighting.

Somehow, this title got a sequel in 2023 called Everybody 1-2-Switch and while it dropped out of sight pretty quickly, it has now made a surprising comeback.\nAs highlighted by Vooks.net, more than a year after its release, the sequel has returned to the top spot in Australia as the best-selling video game.

Now the time has finally arrived. Thanks to a partnership between developer Crazy Viking Studios and retro specialist Digital Eclipse, we can step back into the boots of Volgarr as he embarks on a quest that will prove more deadly than any he’s faced. The result is a game that, frankly, feels improved in just about every conceivable way, making Volgarr the Viking II not only one of the best 2D action platformers on Switch, but one of the best of all time.\nLet’s start with the obvious: Volgarr II is brutal. There have been several adjustments made to make the game more approachable to newcomers, which we’ll get into in more detail later, but you should know that this isn’t for the faint of heart. You will die in Volgarr II, and you will die a lot. Like the original, getting through each stage is an exercise in learning the layout, anticipating every enemy position, and observing their attack patterns and weaknesses. When entering each new area for the first time, attempting to storm through as quickly as you can is simply not an option; you can be sure that there will be something lying in wait to bring your journey to a swift and bloody end.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Show them something popular like Elden Ring and, despite its grandeur, it might prove too much in all facets. But Vampire Survivors? It's an easy sell: simple, digestible, ridiculous value.\nAll of this is to say, One BTN Bosses is from the same school of the easy sell. You can fight bosses with one hand in a packet of pickled onion Space Raiders, after all.\nRead more",

You get your bearings, and you soon meet up with another, only slightly irritating, small child. His name is Kimothy, which sounds like something you’d only say as a joke to annoy friends named Kim, and then only once because it would be stupid to say it again. It’s fine! Leaves flutter, rays of sun cavort through trees, and the music is utterly gorgeous. The game opens on twinkly piano and mournful strings, infused with a good dose of stirring JRPG whimsy, and soon transforms into whatever the genre of music is called that makes you want to immediately go on a massive adventure. Potion-punk. Slime-swing. Limit breakcore etc.\nRead more",

I dunno about that, though between the Asus ROG Ally X and the Steam Deck OLED, those who stayed their hand on their earlier handheld gaming PC counterparts do have a couple of quality second-genners to choose from. Valve’s effort manages to wring multiple performance, design, and battery life improvements out of its new display, while the ROG Ally X makes similar upgrades with a bigger-yet-better take on the original ROG Ally.\nThe only thing to do, clearly, is make them fight. It’s probably in the Irish Code Duello or something: \"Should one portable games box impugn another’s honour by releasing shortly after it, satisfaction must be claimed through a comparison article.\" My hands are bound here, folks, though if you yourself have been playing the waiting game on a handheld purchase, perhaps this little head-to-head can help you pick the right one.\nRead more",

          "description": "Cinematic platformer Bionic Bay opens on a scene of a very large egg doing very bad things - easily my third favourite genre of speculative fiction. You awake to a world of tree trunks that twist like viscera and corroded contraptions powered by luminous goop that’s stored in the balls, uh, big glass orbs. A beam of light soon fills your character with newfound vigour, which is a nice moment of triumph in what otherwise feels like a deeply oppressive rust pit, all unsteady platforms and jagged pipes.\nIt doesn’t take long before you start spotting examples of the reason Bionic Bay went viral earlier this week. Above your head hangs a painstakingly detailed mass of vents and cables, looming lifelike with dust and shadow and history. I stood and stared because I’d seen how the sausage was made, but I like to think I would have lingered longer than usual anyway. It really is just that impressive.\nRead more",

So if there's only one person in your village who knows how to brew tastier beer, and they die after being freakishly savaged by a passing wolf (it happens), suddenly your village will have no artisanal lager master. The results may be devastating. Luckily, you can share knowledge in a number of ways - by copying books, or having \"wise conversations\". The exception to this is child characters, whose pea-sized brains can't learn specialist knowledge, only soaking up basic attributes like \"manners\" from the teachers you assign to them. Well, until now. The developers for the Rimworld-meets-Crusader Kings catastrophe simulator have made kids a little smarter.

          "description": "It's a hell of a thing to showcase a remake weeks after kiboshing the developers of the original game. In early July, Gothic creators Piranha Bytes were reportedly shuttered as part of Embracer Group's mad race to trim costs, following their decade-long acquisition binge. Watching THQ Nordic's new Gothic Remake trailer, below, feels a little like watching a vivisectionist parade about in somebody else's skin. Still, the remake's developers Alkimia Interactive aren't to blame for Embracer's fuck-ups, and I am selfishly happy to see Gothic return as an Unreal Engine 5 production - even if I didn't play the original back in 2001.\r\n\n\r\nSin did play the original game, and in her 2016 retrospective, she paints an absorbing picture of a dark fantasy \"microsociety\" in which every community \"has a reason to exist, a means of providing for itself, a social order, and a long term goal\". It's a setup that reminds me of my beloved Roadwarden, even as the sight of grumpy lizards slinking through undergrowth has me silently mouthing \"fus roh dah\".\r\n \nRead more",

No colons, no bespoke jargon, no tortuous subtitles like \"Gaia's B.O.U.N.T.Y.\" or \"Hyperion's Wild Rumpus\" - just the steadying prospect of a titanic quest that, who knows, may involve actual titans. The action-RPG beneath the moniker appears similarly straightforward: it's about following a plot thread through a mythological world in top-down view, smashing Ancient Greek giga-crabs and the like to obtain shinier, pointier varieties of gear. I'm sure I don't need to tell you that there's an endgame in which you farm monsters for crafting materials.\r\n\n\r\nLike Pandora opening her box, but without the accompanying tidal wave of sickness, curses and death, THQ Nordic have released a new trailer that talks you though all of this in detail.

Every level would introduce a new goo type or a twist on the basic bridge-building puzzle that challenged you to get a gaggle of gurgling balls to the nearest pipe. World Of Goo 2 pursues that sense of novelty with just as much twitchy eagerness as its predecessor, throwing new toys and goos at the player in an effort to keep you on your sludge-coated toes. That pursuit doesn't always result in pleasing new levels, though. There is a \"hit and miss\" feeling to things this time around. But those hits are hits. For anyone who has spent the last 16 years yearning for more sticky structure-building: I hope you like comically unpredictable fluids.\nRead more",

          "description": "British comedy is too often defined by its relationship to America: either as merely irony and sarcasm, which we're told Americans don't understand, or as a sprightly ideas factory for works such as The Office, which Americans can bless by re-making at scale.\r\n\nPeel back the curtains of American cultural hegemony however and you may find the true pulsing core of British comedy that lies beneath: innuendo. No American network is in a bidding war to import Vic and Bob or remake Bottom, and Carry On and Benny Hill are assumed to be anachronisms in our modern times, but Thank Goodness You're Here! enters the conversation with a nudge and a wink. It's a cheeky 2-3 hour adventure through a small northern town, and it's here to educate the entire world of our nation's obsession with sausages and bare bottoms.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Whew, that's a lot. Potentially too much. But hey, I am here for something ambitious and interesting, of which it ticks both boxes.\nRead more",

A Roomba capable of tunnelling through miles of procedurally generated, monster-infested crust so as to reorganise the Earth's core and bring about its ultimate objective - a sparkling living room. I enjoy the militant reductiveness of this character motivation. There are sprawling underground ecosystems to discover, yes, weird plants to harvest, fractious clumps of tentacles to appraise, avoid or slaughter.

It's possible, however, that Overwatch 2 will swing back in the other direction, as Blizzard are now \"exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results\", with a view to restoring some of the joyful chaos that saw entire teams of Reinhardts charging the objective in formation.\n Read more",

It's out now. \nFallout: London, the massive fan-made Fallout 4 mod set in Poundland Prime (No Elephants, Some Castles, Canary Wharfare) has finally got a release date. Happy days, it’s actually today, Thursday 25th July. The news comes from Inverse, who’ve sent their dear alsatian companions sniffing around the mod’s Discord. Yesterday, Team FOLON lead Dean Carter shared the song I Just Can't Wait (For Tomorrow) then, when sniffed at harder, confirmed that the 'Tomorrow' part meant tomorrow (as in, today), \"Unless nuclear war happens.\"\nRead more",

And for some, it'll deliver what's needed: a fairly good time. A time marked by a loop that does hack 'n slash, management, and a dash of base repairs to an average degree. For me, though, and possibly many others, I simply don't think this mix ever truly captures what makes even the simplest of tower defence games so captivating.\nRead more",

Also, everyone is just so gosh darn likeable, with their foppish hats plopped atop stretched bodies, and dialogue that remains resolute, chirpy, and eager, even when you’re click-marching these poor folk straight to their deaths.\nStill, none of this will stop me will sacrificing every last man, woman, and child of these beleaguered warriors if it means preserving a single one of my immaculately crafted staircases.\nRead more",

          "description": "Horka polevila, ale žár nadšení Strahováků z techniky nepolevuje! Za poslední měsíc se stalo několik událostí doslova kosmického charakteru. Došlo k úspěšnému startu a vypuštění sond z rakety Ariane 6, Boeing vyslal Starliner na oběžnou dráhu, kde nyní jeho pasažéři neplánovaně už druhý měsíc setrvávají. KiCAD má novou verzi a blíží se konference k jeho dalšímu vývoji. Objevil se nový čip kombinující RP2040 s ethernetem a povedlo se na čipu vytvořit pulzní safírové lasery. Jsou vám tyto novinky málo? Pak jsou na Virtuální Bastlírnu připravená i obecnější hardwarová témata!\r\n\r\nZa HW lze probrat zajímavé nově objevené parazitní jevy v SiC MOSFETech, jak se dá operační zesilovač \"zaseknout\" nebo k čemu jsou dobré ztrátové koaxiální kabely a kde je sehnat. Samozřejmě bastlíři narazili i na kuriozity, například doutnavkovou logiku nebo plošňák, jehož součástí je ohýbačka na THT součástky.\r\n\r\nSoftware ani tentokrát nezůstane stranou - kromě již zmíněné nové verze KiCADu se dá podívat na stavbu linuxového managovaného switche, NanoKVM, převod videa z DisplayPortu na eink nebo emulátor NESu na Picopadu.\r\n\r\nJak je zvykem, s postupem večera se jistě přejde i k lehce bizarním tématům - kupříkladu, co provedl CrowdStrike, jak zprovoznit Doom na erotických hračkách pro pány, jak vypadá nestandardní 12V USB nebo jak se ztrácí některé části audio záznamů z CD, protože je většina SW neumí správně přečíst.\r\n\r\nPříští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve středu 7. srpna od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

We're also continuing to see the rise of expansions for some of the most famous games out there, from World of Warcraft: The War Within to Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail. \n\n\nWith all that said, it's easy to get overwhelmed by the sheer number of game releases as the months go on, especially if you're partway through a playthrough and learn that more games are launching the same week.

          "description": "Fortnite's Fall Guys collaboration event has officially arrived, and with it comes multiple obstacle courses in Creative Islands and Battle Royale mode. However, to access the course in BR mode, you'll need to find special statues known as Bean Idols, which only appear in a certain area. Hfere's how to find Bean Idols during the Fortnite X Fall Guys event.\n\n\nBean Idol locations in Fortnite X Fall Guys event\n\n\nBean Idols are golden statues that spawn exclusively in Classy Courts. As you exit the Battle Bus and glide toward this landmark, you'll spot the obstacle course in the sky, with light beams surrounding it. Each light shows the location of a Bean Idol.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nIf you're already on the ground in another region, you can run over toward the obstacle course and Fall Guys character icon on your map near Classy Courts. As you approach the area, you'll spot the lights in the sky, allowing you to find the statues and participate in the obstacle course.\n\n\nWhat do Bean Idols do in the Fortnite X Fall Guys event?\n\n\nBean Idols are the key to participating in the Battle Royale version of the Fall Guys obstacle course. Once you interact with the statue, your character will turn into a Fall Guys bean. A timer will begin immediately after, giving you a limited time to complete the obstacle course to maximize your rewards. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nAlthough other players won't directly hurt you during it, they can sabotage your efforts and slow you down. You can also get caught in the Storm if you're unlucky with circle spawns, so keep an eye on your map and the Storm timer as you're running the course.\n\n\nYour rewards after completing the Fall Guys obstacle course depend on your time. Earning gold will reward you with valuable, rare weapons and consumables, while lower tiers will give you more common items. Nonetheless, they're great prizes to claim as long as you don't get eliminated shortly after.\n\nThe post How to find Bean Idols in Fortnite X Fall Guys event appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, the Prestige Level is still not high enough to attract the biggest talents right away. In fact, schools at this level represent what I call an \"average pick.\" You can have a lot of fun with these schools, and there are some decent choices worth considering in Dynasty mode.\n\n\n10 best 2-star schools to consider in Football 25 Dynasty Mode\n\n\nIn case you aren't aware, the star rating of a school in College Football 25 isn't a grade of its squads. Instead, it's a composite average of all your program's grades. This opens up some unique challenges - a few squads have good ratings but relatively poor program ratings, while it's the exact opposite for some.\n\n\nSchool\nPrestige Level\nOVR\nOFF\nDEF\n\n\nArmy Black Knights\n2.5\n74\n76\n74\n\n\nBoise State Broncos\n2.5\n81\n81\n82\n\n\nMemphis Tigers\n2\n82\n82\n84\n\n\nTulsa Golden Hurricane\n2\n77\n77\n77\n\n\nVanderbilt Commodores\n2.5\n81\n81\n81\n\n\nWyoming Cowboys\n2\n77\n77\n77\n\n\nTroy Trojans\n2\n76\n76\n77\n\n\nMarshall Thundering Herd\n2\n77\n76\n79\n\n\nDuke Blue Devils\n2\n81\n81\n81\n\n\nIndiana Hoosiers\n2.5\n82\n81\n84\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're up for a challenge, the Army Black Knights could be an exciting save. While the school has the weakest starting squad on this list, it enjoys a better program rating than most of the other names mentioned here. On the other hand, the Memphis Tigers have a relatively poor Prestige Level rating compared to the quality of their squad.\n\n\nDo understand that picking a school with a 2-star Prestige Level can be a substantial challenge and could require many hours to set up a strong foundation.\n\nThe post Top 10 2-star schools for College Football 25 Dynasty Mode appeared first on Destructoid.",

It will be out in September for PC, PS5, and Switch. The exact day hasn’t been announced.\n\n\nBased on the name, if you asked me what Caravan SandWitch was, I would have guessed that it was a whimsical food truck game. Not so, as it’s actually a sci-fi, post-apocalyptic exploration game set on the planet Cigalo. It’s post-apocalyptic in the sense that humans ruined the environment, as we’re wont to do. There wasn’t an actual apocalypse there in the cosmic or religious sense.\n\n\n\n\nCaravan SandWitch is billed as a “semi-open” world. It’s a journey, and along the way, you meet folks and help them with their problems. You drive across a “Provence-like” world in a van. There is no combat, no death, no timer. The art style and aesthetic execution look top-notch based on the trailers.\n\n\nIt’s been in development for a while, starting off as a small indie project that was described as an anti-Mad Max. There was also a demo released a while back. From what I hear, it did a good job highlighting the graphics and movement system, but ended abruptly before you got to any real meat. Hopefully, the meat is good.\n\n\nWe’ll find out next month when Caravan SandWitch launches on PC, PS5, and Switch.\n\nThe post Cozy post-apocalyptic exploration game Caravan SandWitch isn’t as delicious as it sounds, out in September appeared first on Destructoid.",

Players can now build new bus stations in their worlds, and use them to fast travel anywhere within their world.\n\n\nBus Stations will already be established in your existing worlds with this new update, but players can build their own by destroying the current Bus Station. This will give them Rift Shards, which is required for the Station. Players can get on to a Battle Bus from the station and travel to another Station of their choice.\n\n\n\nImage via Epic Games\n\n\n\nThis LEGO Fortnite update has also made it possible for players to edit the settings of their existing worlds. This means players no longer have to create a new world just to try out a world with different settings.\n\n\nLEGO Fortnite players can now change all settings of a world but there are some restrictions still there. Fortnite players cannot change the world mode, and Player Elimination settings cannot be changed as well. Moreover, locked settings from Expert mode cannot be changed.\n\n\nLEGO Fortnite also offers a new Pirate Lifestyle Bundle that players can purchase from the Item Shop. Update v30.40 has also added five new styles for existing Outfits in LEGO Fortnite including an Indiana Jones outfit, and outfits for Abyss, Antheia, The Cube Queen, and Ember.\n\nThe post LEGO Fortnite introduces fast travel via Battle Bus appeared first on Destructoid.",

There's definitely no shortage of things for you to do, but first and foremost, the bridge needs to be fixed. \n\n\nAfter Balor guides you over the broken bridge and into town as you first arrive, you'll have a few days to settle into your new farm home before the residents of Mistria arrive with their first big request. They need to repair the bridge in order to enable travel in and out of Mistria, and as a perk of this, the Saturday Market can begin being held again. \n\n\nHow to get a Pickaxe and repair the bridge in Fields of Mistria\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nAt some point in the first week of your new life in Mistria, you'll receive a letter in the mail from Adeline, asking you to aid in repairing the bridge. After receiving this letter, head east to the bridge in order to trigger a cutscene. \n\n\nAfter this cutscene, a donation box will appear next to the bridge, and you'll need to donate the following resources: \n\n\n\n60 Wood\n\n\n60 Stone\n\n\n\nYou should already have an Axe to gather the needed Wood, thanks to an early morning meeting with Eiland, when you discovered the statue of Caldarus behind a tree on your farm. He'll give you the Worn Axe as a reward, and you can then use it to gather the 60 required Wood.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo get a Pickaxe, you'll need to pick up a quest from the Request Board in town. The quest you need is called ‘Do a Bro a Favor’, and simply requires you to head to the Blacksmiths and talk to Olric. When you speak to him, he’ll give you an Worn Pickaxe which you can then use to mine any small rock and get between one and two Stone. \n\n\nOnce you've got 60 wood and 60 Stone, you can head back to the bridge and place the resources into the box. Then all that's left to do is head back to Adeline to hand in the quest, triggering another cutscene and successfully repairing the bridge. \n\nThe post How to repair the bridge in Fields of Mistria appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "With Valorant being in open beta now, console players can get in on the fun that PC players have been experiencing for years. That being said, is Valorant crossplay compatible between PC and PS5? Here’s what we know.\n\n\nIs Valorant crossplay compatible between PC and PS5?\n\n\nUnfortunately, Valorant does not support crossplay between PC and PS5, nor does PC have that option with Xbox consoles. Due to the nature of the game, PC players do have a massive advantage over console players. This isn’t a game like Overwatch or recent Call of Duty games where the TTK (Time to Kill) is high enough so that those playing on a controller can have a fair gunfight. \n\n\nThe good news is that if you have a friend who plays on PC and you wish to play with them, cross-progression is an option. Whether you want to bring your console account to PC or they bring their PC account to an Xbox Series X/S or PS5, it’s possible.\n\n\nIs Valorant crossplay between PS5 and Xbox?\n\n\nLuckily, PS5 and Xbox players can match up and squad up together on Valorant. Since players on both consoles are on the same playing field, there are no advantages or disadvantages over the other. \n\n\nJust make sure you actually have the feature enabled so you can broaden your search pool when matchmaking.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHow to enable crossplay on Valorant (PS5 and Xbox only)\n\n\nBy default, you should have crossplay enabled on Valorant if you’re playing the open beta on PS5 or Xbox. However, just to double-check that it’s on, press your menu or options button on your controller to bring up the Options menu.\n\n\nFrom here, select Settings. In the General tab, find the Privacy section and see that “Allow Crossplay” is set to on. You can also set other important options like limiting friend requests and hiding names.\n\n\nSo, unfortunately, you can’t match or link with PC players if you’re on PS5 or Xbox, but you can with other console players.\n\nThe post Is Valorant crossplay compatible between PC and PS5?

We've put together this Mecha BREAK Tier List to order the raw power potential of each of the Mechs available in the Beta Playtest.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nMecha BREAK Mech Tier List\n\n\nWhile every Mech in Mecha Break has its uses, some are certainly overall more stronger than others. However, as this is an early Beta Playtest, it's very likely that the mechs will continue to receive balancing tuning ahead of release. As such, this Mech Tier List for Mecha Break is based purely off of the state of the beta playtest. \n\n\nAll mechs in the S Tier category are very strong and versatile, and always a solid option for any battle on any map in any mode in Mecha Break. Those in the A Tier are overall strong as well and should be able to hold up in every scenario, but may be weaker than an S Tier counterpart. The mechs in the B Tier have specific uses that make them advantageous in certain scenarios, but overall not as versatile as those in the S or A Tier. Finally, the lone mech in the C Tier, Falcon, is a bit under tuned at the moment and needs a little bit of lover to be considered a competitive option compared to the other mechs.\n\n\nUsing this Tier List, you can choose which Mechs you want to focus on farming currency for in order to unlock them. Of course, be sure to pick a mech that fits with your playstyle so make sure you're having fun! Here is our Mech Tier List:\n\n\nS Tier\n\n\n\nAquila\n\n\nHurricane\n\n\nPanther\n\n\nStego\n\n\n\nA Tier\n\n\n\nLuminae\n\n\nPinaka\n\n\nSkyraider\n\n\nWelkin\n\n\n\nB Tier\n\n\n\nAlysnes\n\n\nInferno\n\n\nNarukami\n\n\nTricera\n\n\n\nC Tier\n\n\n\nFalcon\n\n\nThe post Mecha BREAK Tier List for all Mechs in Beta Playtest appeared first on Destructoid.",

Thus far, Eyeo GmbH, the company behind Adblock Plus, has come out on top. However, with Axel Springer's reformulated claims now rooted firmly in copyright law, the stakes are high at Germany's highest court. A long-running lawsuit involving Sony and a cheat device may yet hold the answers.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",
