The titular arena is a large room in which you, a large man, bash a large amount of enemies. You have to punch a gong between waves to trigger the next, and this struck me as a nice pre-emptive nudge that every problem you face in Kiborg can be solved by rapidly moving your fist towards offending objects, which turned out not to be too far off the mark.\n \nRead more",

According to Obsidian's studio head Feargus Urquhart, the project is rubbing along nicely.

Multiplayer shooty Helldivers 2 is still sitting around 35,000 concurrent players, which is perfectly respectable, if only around 10% of its peak back in April. Still, a clutch of disgruntled ‘divers have recently found a novel way to protest an increasingly unpopular series of nerfs: laying down their guns and letting the bots take the damn planet.\n“If Super Earth wanted to remain safe, they would stop nerfing our guns,\" reads one comment on the subreddit, in response to a post titled “Let the bots advance. Let the Super Earth burn.” It seems to have picked up some steam inside the actual game, too. As of earlier this week, there’s only around a thousand players actively trying to stop the bots advancing perilously close to the home planet, via Gamesradar.\nWhether this is all massively overblown for the sake of a dramatic yarn or not, Arrowhead themselves have taken note of player concerns over nerfs. Yesterday, game director Mikael Eriksson unveiled a plan for the next 60 days, directly addressing player feedback over the controversial ‘Escalation of Freedom’ update.\n \nRead more",

It expresses this by way of its scoring system, where you earn \"Prestige points\" for snapping pictures that fit one of five categories: \"Brutal\" scenes of characters being slain; moments of \"Horror\", such as the spectacle of an approaching horde; comical \"Outtakes\", like characters caught in bizarre poses; moments of \"Drama\", such as people reacting to discoveries; and \"Erotic\" photos of women alive or undead, which range from snaps of exposed underwear to close-ups of cleavage.\nThe Erotica tag has, however, been chopped from the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, in what Capcom gingerly suggest isn't \"a response to a changing cultural climate\", but expressive of the view that earning points from such photos is not \"an appropriate reward for survival and not a skill required of a journalist trying to stay alive\".\n Read more",

The Deck’s compatibility issues aren’t nearly as issue-some as they were at launch, but between its Linux-based SteamOS and its relatively mild processing power, but it is true that beefier Windows handhelds will more likely cater to your entire cross-launcher library.\nUnless, that is, you get something else to run them for you. Streaming games on the Steam Deck has emerged as a nifty workaround for the portable PC’s lingering compatibility woes, making even officially unsupported games playable. Usually with much better performance, too, as the actual rendering work is done remotely – what you see on the Deck’s screen is basically a video feed of that remote device’s display output, with your control input beamed the other way via a low-latency connection. And because you’re not using SteamOS or the internal hardware to actually run the game, it’s not bound by their limits.\nRead more",

Doing this requires you to stand upright in full view, with your back turned upon an entire space station's worth of shiny domed technology and guttural industrial noises. Delightful!\nAmongst the players harrowed and compelled by this fixture is Fede Álvarez, director of the 2013 Evil Dead remake, 2016's Don't Breathe and, most recently Alien: Romulus - the seventh and avowedly \"back to basics\" Alien movie. Isolation is the Alien experience that convinced Álvarez the Alien could still be scary, after decades of milking the creature's dugs for spin-off movies and making it share a screen with the Predator, the Pepsi Max to Alien's Dom Pérignon 1921. In possibly self-defeating homage to Creative Assembly's work, he's filled the movie with Emergency Telephones, turning them into a straightforward-sounding form of foreshadowing.\n Read more",

          "description": "Last week, Bethesda released a remastered edition of Doom and Doom II on Steam, with lots of extra episodes and improvements. One of these new features is a built-in browser for mods, and support for many existing mods that previously required a different version of the game. Basically, lots of good fan-made mods are now playable on the Steam version of ye olde Doom. That's neat! Ah, but there is some demon excrement on the health pack, so to speak. The mod browser lacks moderation and lets people upload the work of others with their own name pinned as the author. That's prompted one level designer to call it \"a massive breach of trust and violation of norms the Doom community has done its best to hold to for those 30 years.\" \nRead more",

I first visited the burnt-out ruins of this zombie-infested world a decade ago and I returned to it this week to find a tree-puncher that, despite bearing the pockmarks of early access, retains much of what made it enjoyable back when the survival genre was still wearing its baby onesie. Instead of a review, I figured I'd scribble together a mini starter guide for new (or returning) players. Partly because the game is a proper time sink and it was taking me so long to get through everything. But mostly because I wanted to use that numberful headline.

          "description": "I was partial to a scrappy little strategy game even before idiot billionaires doomed the planet, and the UK to brain-steaming heat just when you thought we'd escape it this year. Khaligrad is plenty scrappy. Its edges are rough and you have to figure it out yourself, but it's more intuitive than it appears, and easy to operate once you discern some basics. It's scrappy too in that it's, well. It's Stalingrad. Not really: its world is so fictional it's their 15th century. But the invaders are explicitly fascists and the defenders communists embroiled in a long and brutal semi-guerrilla city war with World War 2 technology. Thankfully, it's stripped of any actual fashy or genocidal play-acting beyond each side doing \"hail the empire/union\" bits as a sign off.\nI think that's why, despite its brutal and difficult setting, it's this year's entry in the long tradition of Low-Intensity Strategy Games For When Hot Why Hot Please Stop You Cannot See My Begging Tears For They Evaporate.\nRead more",

The new game - currently untitled and without a release date - is a first-person sci-fi RPG set in an alternate-1900s North America, which ostensibly combines the ingenuity and gadgetry of Dishonored and Prey with a \"real RPG\" experience redolent of Skyrim and modern-day Fallout.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's got a default jump range of 17.55 light years and two big prongs sticking out of its face like a sci-fi forklift. Cool. The catch is that this ship can only be bought with real money for now, say the developers. This is part of Frontier's new strategy of having paid-for ships in the game. I don't really play Elite Dangerous anymore, so I don't have strong feelings about that. But I do have strong feelings about the space trucker advertisement the developer has put together for the new ship. Come watch it with me.\nRead more",

The supermarket chain – third biggest in the UK by turnover and purveyors of ill-fitting clothes and surprisingly good doughnuts alike – has added light-up gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets to its mountain of own-brand wares.\nAsda being what it is (Americans, if you’re unfamiliar, think Walmart with less gun violence), it’s all dirt cheap as well. £17 for a full-size keyboard. £16 for an FPS mouse. Overwhelmed with curiosity, I ended up taking home a complete starter set (keeb, different mouse, headset, and mousemat) for £45, or about a third of the price of the Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL that I’d shortly kick off my desk. Could this be a new frontier in affordable PC hardware, bringing tech to the masses in a way no specialist retailer ever could, or should supermarkets stick to cereal and meal deals?

As of the game’s latest hotfix blog, we’ve now got a better idea when we’ll start seeing some of these “smaller bits and pieces.” Bits and pieces? In this economy? Yes, and this month in fact. “Late August” to be precise by quoting a vague statement precisely.\nRead more",

I'm pretty sure not having eight gigs of RAM is heretical, but never fear, you can probably compensate by taking a leaf from the God-Emperor's book and arrange for a host of dying psykers to pour their brain energy into your motherboard.\nAll of which is to say that Focus Home have released the system requirements for huge-shouldered action game Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2.

We had Deviator last week - now, it's time for a bumper helping of the heebie-jeebies in the shape of Perennial Order. The title makes it sound like an eBay delivery of potted geraniums. The game festering beneath is actually a \"plant horror\" boss rusher with twin stick melee controls, unlockable \"Instinct\" abilities and one-hit deaths.\nIn a gift to headline writers everywhere, the developers, four-person Gardenfiend Games, are calling it \"Hollow Knight meets Titan Souls\", and who am I to deny them? It's got one of those \"painterly\" art styles, too, though other words come to mind, such as \"rotted\" and \"unhallowed\" and \"manky\". It's out on 6th September.

It's called \"landless adventurers\" and it'll let you play as disgraced dirtbag travelling the world in a sort of medieval gig economy.

Leaves flutter, rays of sun cavort through trees, and the music is utterly gorgeous. The game opens on twinkly piano and mournful strings, infused with a good dose of stirring JRPG whimsy, and soon transforms into whatever the genre of music is called that makes you want to immediately go on a massive adventure.

I dunno about that, though between the Asus ROG Ally X and the Steam Deck OLED, those who stayed their hand on their earlier handheld gaming PC counterparts do have a couple of quality second-genners to choose from. Valve’s effort manages to wring multiple performance, design, and battery life improvements out of its new display, while the ROG Ally X makes similar upgrades with a bigger-yet-better take on the original ROG Ally.\nThe only thing to do, clearly, is make them fight. It’s probably in the Irish Code Duello or something: \"Should one portable games box impugn another’s honour by releasing shortly after it, satisfaction must be claimed through a comparison article.\" My hands are bound here, folks, though if you yourself have been playing the waiting game on a handheld purchase, perhaps this little head-to-head can help you pick the right one.\nRead more",

You awake to a world of tree trunks that twist like viscera and corroded contraptions powered by luminous goop that’s stored in the balls, uh, big glass orbs. A beam of light soon fills your character with newfound vigour, which is a nice moment of triumph in what otherwise feels like a deeply oppressive rust pit, all unsteady platforms and jagged pipes.\nIt doesn’t take long before you start spotting examples of the reason Bionic Bay went viral earlier this week. Above your head hangs a painstakingly detailed mass of vents and cables, looming lifelike with dust and shadow and history. I stood and stared because I’d seen how the sausage was made, but I like to think I would have lingered longer than usual anyway. It really is just that impressive.\nRead more",

So if there's only one person in your village who knows how to brew tastier beer, and they die after being freakishly savaged by a passing wolf (it happens), suddenly your village will have no artisanal lager master. The results may be devastating. Luckily, you can share knowledge in a number of ways - by copying books, or having \"wise conversations\". The exception to this is child characters, whose pea-sized brains can't learn specialist knowledge, only soaking up basic attributes like \"manners\" from the teachers you assign to them. Well, until now. The developers for the Rimworld-meets-Crusader Kings catastrophe simulator have made kids a little smarter.

It seems just yesterday I was getting very jealous at Matthew Castle (RPS in peace) for getting to preview the sequel to my beloved Shadows Of Amn. Fast forward several turns, Larian’s RPG banger is officially one year old since release, and there’s now a much higher chance that strangers at pubs will understand why my failed romance with Jaheira as a youth was such a deeply heartbreaking experience. Baldur’s Gate 3 itself looks to be done and dusted following the upcoming patch, but Larian now seem to be gearing up for their next charm offensive with a new “community focused” YouTube channel, as well as further teasing their two games currently in development.\nRead more",

In early July, Gothic creators Piranha Bytes were reportedly shuttered as part of Embracer Group's mad race to trim costs, following their decade-long acquisition binge. Watching THQ Nordic's new Gothic Remake trailer, below, feels a little like watching a vivisectionist parade about in somebody else's skin. Still, the remake's developers Alkimia Interactive aren't to blame for Embracer's fuck-ups, and I am selfishly happy to see Gothic return as an Unreal Engine 5 production - even if I didn't play the original back in 2001.\r\n\n\r\nSin did play the original game, and in her 2016 retrospective, she paints an absorbing picture of a dark fantasy \"microsociety\" in which every community \"has a reason to exist, a means of providing for itself, a social order, and a long term goal\".

World Of Goo 2 pursues that sense of novelty with just as much twitchy eagerness as its predecessor, throwing new toys and goos at the player in an effort to keep you on your sludge-coated toes. That pursuit doesn't always result in pleasing new levels, though. There is a \"hit and miss\" feeling to things this time around. But those hits are hits.

I caught a brief presentation earlier in the week and yeah, this seems promising. On the one hand, it reminds me of cheery 16-bit hop 'n' boppers like, say, the Mega Drive adaptation of Disney's Aladdin. On the other, it makes me think of side-scrolling Soulslikes (Scroulslikes?) such as Blasphemous and the frantic worldbuilding of Rick & Morty.\r\n \nRead more",

Activision have released it as a 4GB open-source project that can be explored in a 3D model-viewing tool. That's cool.

          "description": "When a new update happens in a live service game, things often break or have some kind of exploit. In the recent patches for Diablo 4 Season 5, trading has been disabled, leaving many players wondering why that’s the case or if the system itself is broken. \n\n\nThanks to one such hiccup, Diablo 4 has disabled trading in Season 5. If you're looking for news on why the decision was made or when trading should come back, we've outlined Blizzard's response below. \n\n\nWhy is trading disabled in Diablo 4?\n\n\nTrading is currently disabled in Diablo 4 due to a trading exploit. Players were able to duplicate items very easily, making it very useful for farming up endgame items like Stygian Stones and Resplendent Sparks.\n\n\nWhile news of this was very fresh on how to do it, Blizzard took swift action to disable all sorts of trading, even if you drop items for other players. \n\n\nWhen is trading coming back?\n\n\nRight now, there isn’t any update on what time or date the feature will come back. So, if you’re looking to make a few million extra gold from lucky farming, you’ll have to wait. It should only take a week at most, or whenever the next hotfix is, so it'll be sooner since this is a shorter season too.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nCan you get banned for the trading exploit?\n\n\nThere’s a fairly decent chance that you can get banned for participating in these types of dupe or trading exploits in Diablo 4. Just to be safe, you shouldn’t try to perform any sort of glitches that can get you in trouble or give you a huge boost in the game’s progression.\n\n\nUnless it was a very specific glitch like the recently discovered (and now patched) one regarding a player who used the Rogue class and the Umbra Crux Unique dagger, you can’t get banned. \n\n\nTrying to replicate or find other ways to get aggressively ahead and skip all the grind in the game can get you banned, though. Just play the game normally and grind away.\n\nThe post Why is trading disabled in Diablo 4? appeared first on Destructoid.",

While the servers are taken down, matchmaking will be unavailable. The official X handle has shared some vital information that will help you plan.\n\n\nWhen will Madden NFL 25 server maintenance begin\n\n\nThe first server maintenance will start at 6 a.m. ET/3 a.m. PT/5 a.m. CT. This is the same schedule that EA Sports has been following for all server maintenance of College Football 25. Solo battles will be gated 30 minutes prior to the beginning of the maintenance.\n\n\nUnfortunately, EA Sports hasn't announced when the maintenance will be over. Since this is the first maintenance of Madden NFL 25, it's best to expect at least a few hours of downtime. This server downtime could be extensive, depending on the type of work that the developers will do.\n\n\n\n\nWhich Madden NFL 25 game modes will be unavailable during server maintenance\n\n\nAll game modes that have online matchmaking will be affected. You won't be able to log in to Ultimate Team mode. Even if you manage to log in, trying to matchmake will show you an error code. Any kind of online friendlies will be unavailable as well.\n\n\nYou can play the Franchise mode (as long as it's the single-player version) when the servers are down. You can also try out the Superstar mode.

They're still made with a ton of quality and care, sporting some great music, cool setpieces, and the same great art you expect. \n\n\nOne such mission that rotates has you assaulting a Cabal base, though you may be wondering what you can get from it. Here's which exotic weapon is available from the Vox Obscura mission in Destiny 2.\n\n\nWhat exotic can you earn from Vox Obscura in Destiny 2?\n\n\nImage via Destructoid.\n\n\nThe Dead Messenger exotic grenade launcher is available from the Vox Obscura mission. It's available as an end-mission reward after defeating the final boss. This grenade launcher comes with the Intrinsic Trait Trinary Vision, which makes the grenade launcher a Wave Frame archetype with three separate waves splitting out from where it lands. \n\n\nIt also comes with the perk The Fundamentals, which lets you hold the reload button to change the weapon element between Solar, Arc, and Void. Each provides a small stat bonus when it's the current element.\n\n\nThis weapon can be further improved through crafting, thanks to unlockable trait upgrades for the Trinary Vision trait. These are unlocked through completing the Vox Obscura mission several times on Master difficulty, with each completion granting a new level.\n\n\nIs the Dead Messenger worth using?\n\n\nGiven its perks and strengths, the Dead Messenger is well worth using as an ad clear exotic in PvE. The ability to send out three waves can utterly wreck a crowd of ads with just one shot, especially since you can swap to meet any shields you might find and want to break. As for PvP, there's likely a niche use case though it's going to be far less effective.\n\nThe post What exotic is available from the Vox Obscura mission in Destiny 2? appeared first on Destructoid.",

But there can be some situations where a QB can go on a solo run, and being fast on such occasions definitely helps a lot. In case you're wondering, there are some surprising names in the list of the ten fastest QBs in the game at launch.\n\n\nTop 10 QBs in Madden NFL 25 with highest speed\n\n\nThe best attribute to determine a QB's speed in Madden NFL 25 is the SPD attribute. You'll find the mention of a few other attributes as well (some of them are key to a quarterback's performance). However, the ranking is solely based on their speed attribute alone.\n\n\nName\nSPD\nOVR\nAGI\nACC\nAWR\n\n\nLamar Jackson\n95\n98\n95\n95\n98\n\n\nJustin Fields\n93\n75\n93\n96\n61\n\n\nKyler Murray\n92\n77\n90\n93\n66\n\n\nAnthony Richardson\n91\n74\n88\n92\n71\n\n\nMalik Willis\n90\n63\n92\n93\n34\n\n\nJayden Daniels\n90\n74\n91\n91\n70\n\n\nJalen Hurts\n89\n86\n91\n91\n80\n\n\nJoshua Dobbs\n89\n69\n85\n87\n63\n\n\nGeno Smith\n89\n78\n80\n84\n79\n\n\nJosh Allen\n88\n92\n85\n92\n87\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLamar Jackson is the outright king among the QBs when it comes to being fast.

The film's domestic opening for the August 9 weekend brought in only $8.6 million, taking fourth place behind Deadpool & Wolverine, It Ends With Us, and Twisters for its debut. \n\n\nOverall, Borderlands made a worldwide box office gross of $16.9 million (via The Numbers), which is tiny compared to its reported $115 million budget (via IGN). Assuming the typical marketing spend outside of its production budget, D+ Cinemascore, and negative fan sentiment, Borderlands doesn't look like it'll make that money back.\n\n\n\n\nBox office YouTuber and analyst Dan Murrell says that Borderlands will be one of the biggest box office bombs of the year, if not the largest. What doesn't help are the awful reviews for Borderlands, with our sister site WGTC calling the film \"bottom of the barrel.\"\n\n\nSurprisingly, some big names are part of the eclectic Borderlands cast, including Jack Black (School of Rock) as Claptrap, Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween) as Tannis, Cate Blanchett (Thor: Ragnarok) as Lilith, and Kevin Hart plays Roland. Despite so many household names, series developer Gearbox may want to forget this entry ever happened, and remain focused on its new game in development. \n\n\nIt's not all bad news for the Borderlands series, however. The third game has seen a 14.5% player boost on Steam over the past 30 days (via Steam Charts), likely due to the publicity of the movie (or viewers of the film who want to forget about it). \n\nThe post Borderlands movie is a complete disaster at the box office appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The new Agent, Jane Doe, has made her grand entrance to the ZZZ world, tying into the Undercover R&B episode. But if you look at the current banners, you'll notice that she's nowhere to be found despite her appearing in Version 1.1's patch notes. We're here to explain when Jane Doe comes out in Zenless Zone Zero and provide more insight into her robust abilities.\n\n\nZenless Zone Zero Jane Doe release date\n\n\nBased on the banner schedule and the Version 1.1 Special Program, the S-Rank Jane Doe will be released on Sept. 4, 2024. The program confirms her debut for the latter half of the update as Qingyi takes the stage for launch. The A-Rank Seth Lowell will also be a part of the upcoming Zenless Zone Zero banner, which will likely have better chances at pulls.\n\n\nImage via miHoYo \n\n\nAs a Physical Anomaly Agent, Jane packs a punch with her Passion State, a form that launches multiple rapid attacks with considerable damage. She looks to be a pretty speedy fighter, just like the other Physical Agents, Billy Kid and Nekomata. Plus, Jane introduces a new faction, the Mountain Lion Gang, a crime syndicate known to stir up trouble.\n\n\nEven though Jane Doe has yet to arrive in ZZZ as a banner, you can play as her during the Undercover R&B Special Episode. Moreover, she'll be the first character to roam freely around New Eridu, a feat that could only done with Proxies in its previous version. Expect more Agents to have this exploration feature in the upcoming updates.\n\n\nIf you want to understand Jane Doe's combat abilities, progress further in the current main storyline to unlock the Special Episode. You'll also get a glimpse of Seth Lowell's unique dynamics as he goes toe-to-toe with Jane in battle.\n\nThe post When will Jane Doe release in Zenless Zone Zero? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Clear River Games and Bitwave Games have announced that the sequel to the 1992 NES/Famicom game Gimmick (also known as Mr. Gimmick) is releasing soon. Gimmick 2 launches September 5, 2024 for Switch and PC. PlayStation and Xbox versions will release later.\n\n\nI’m rather surprised because we just got the first actual gameplay trailer last month, and the announcement of the game itself was a month before that. Not that I think a 2D revival of an NES game would have the most protracted development cycle, but I would think the PR run-up would be a lot longer.\n\n\nInitially released in Europe and Japan in 1992, Gimmick gained a reputation for its deep, inventive, and extremely challenging gameplay. It also helped that the title also carries a tremendous price tag on the collector’s market. Despite its reputation, it remains a rather obscure title. However, its profile was lifted somewhat by the game’s re-release on modern platforms, Gimmick: Special Edition.\n\n\n\n\nYou play as Yokai Yumetaro, a diminutive green thing who can conjure and throw stars. The unique hook of the original title was the physics that control these stars, as you would not only use them to defeat enemies but also ride them over gaps. As I mentioned, it was a rather difficult game.\n\n\nGimmick 2 brings new visuals and a soundtrack by David Wise. It looks to follow the formula of the original title, but (and this is based off the trailer) it seems to focus more on puzzles and combat than it does on careful platforming.\n\n\nGimmick 2 arrives for PC and Switch on September 5, 2024. The date for PlayStation and Xbox versions will be announced later.\n\nThe post NES revival Gimmick 2 is out in September appeared first on Destructoid.",

Having someone like Patrick Mahomes or Christian McCaffrey in your lineup will make it easier to reach the endzone. But running bad plays in attack with the best of talents will make little sense as your attackers will be brought down. Let's take a look at some of the best offensive playbooks you could utilize.\n\n\nBest Madden NFL 25 offensive playbooks\n\n\nIn my experience, picking the best offensive playbook in Madden NFL 25 is almost impossible. When it comes to defensive playbooks, the options are a lot more narrower. The available options widen a lot when it comes to the offensive side of things. Here are some of the fun playbooks to try out if you're looking at trying out something else apart from the default.\n\n\nPlaybook\nBenefits\n\n\nSan Francisco 49ers\nExtremely flexible playbooks ideal for different situations.\nExceptional against wrong cover plays\n\n\nNew England Patriots\nPlaybooks are extremely suitable with the game's meta\nWell-balanced playbooks that are suitable for beginners\n\n\nGreen Bay Packers\nWell-balanced playbooks\nYou can try the playbooks in online matches\n\n\nMiami Dolphins\nThe motion plays are brilliant at confusing the opponents\nIdeal for those who rely on Shotgun and Tight formations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile you can't go wrong with the offensive playbooks of the four teams mentioned here, it's critical to observe the strengths of your team. For example, you won't want to make plays based around riskier passes if your QB and WRs aren't good enough.\n\n\nMadden NFL 25 also allows you to create custom playbooks from the Creation Center. You can select one of the offensive playbooks mentioned here and tune it to suit your team. I haven't experimented much with this feature so far, but this can help you make your offense even more effective.\n\nThe post Best Madden NFL 25 offensive playbooks appeared first on Destructoid.",

The upcoming trailer, releasing on August 15 at 9:00  a.m. PT, will finally let fans know when Dragon Age: The Veilguard will be arriving.\n\n\n\n\nBioWare says that they will also be revealing gameplay in the coming weeks which will showcase “high-level warrior combat” featured in DragonAge: The Veilguard. There will also be a Companion Week which is expected to give us more information about the Companions who will be part of a player’s journey in the game.\n\n\nDragon Age: The Veilguard first went into development all the way back in 2015, so this release date trailer has been largely anticipated. The game was originally announced as Dragon Age: Dreadwolf in 2022 before it was renamed in June this year.\n\n\nNot much is known about Dragon Age: The Veilguard but we do know that Solas is set to be one of the antagonists, if not the main antagonist in the game. Solas is also known as the Dreadwolf and the game’s rename at the last minute does suggest that there might be another villain in store.\n\n\nBioWare general manager Gary McKay told IGN that sticking with Dreadwolf was a “safer choice” but explained that the team wanted to go with a title that was “authentic to the companions that are the heart of this adventure” and he added that BioWare has “worked throughout development to create really incredible backstories for each companion”.\n\n\nDuring Companion Week, players should be able to learn more about the Companions for Dragon Age: The Veilguard.\n\nThe post Dragon Age: The Veilguard release date will finally be revealed tomorrow appeared first on Destructoid.",
