          "description": "Bloody. Good. Game.\nWe'd be lying like filthy, filthy little devils if we claimed that there was any shortage of Castlevania-alikes on the Switch. The likes of Odallus, Aggelos and most prominently the Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon duology are all right there on the eShop to cater for starved fans of Konami's apparently-defunct series - not to mention the Castlevania Anniversary Collection and Castlevania Advance Collection for those thirsting to revisit. It was with some familiarity, then, that we dove headlong into Infernax for review. It all looked very much familiar, you see — medieval style world, NES throwback visuals and a Metroidvania map. But we were, gratefully, mistaken. See, this isn't really a Castlevania-like at all, it's closer to Tecmo's Ninja Gaiden in both difficulty and game feel. And that's certainly no bad thing.\nComing from Berzerk Studio (developer of the sublime Just Shapes & Beats), Infernax is an interesting halfway house between accessibility and raw challenge. Putting it that way makes it sound like the game is uneven in its difficulty, but that isn't the case. It's more that you have options. If you're struggling to make progress, you're never too far from a save point and you can always go elsewhere and fight monsters for XP and/or money, which is then spent on health potions, extra lives, upgrades to your weapon and armour, spells and even more besides. You can also take up sidequests that reward you with more gold and experience, the latter of which is used to upgrade your core strength, health and mana. You're always just within spitting distance of your next improvement, too, which kept us playing when frustration could have set in from its challenges.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "With a rather expensive accessory, of course.\nBack in 2004, the idea of making a video call with your mobile phone felt like the future. 3G was just taking off and several phones were sold on this feature alone – even though the image quality was often terrible and it was impossible to get a signal strong enough to use it often. Although it wouldn't be until much later than 'Face Time' calls became the norm, one company tried to make video calling on the GBA a reality in 2004 – with mixed results.\nJapanese firm Digital Act released the Campho Advance in 2004, a bolt-on camera that allowed you to make video calls using your Nintendo handheld. With a 1.1 megapixel camera and 5fps performance, it wasn't exactly a smooth experience – and that's before you factor in that you have to be connected to a power supply and telephone while using it. Hardly what you'd call elegant. And the price? 19,000 yen was, back in 2004, the equivalent of around £164 / $222, so it wasn't cheap, either.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "\"Coming soon\".\nArguably the standout game on the Nintendo Switch last year was Metroid Dread. It won awards, and is currently on the cusp of becoming the best-selling entry in the Metroid series, having already sold 2.74 million units.\nWith all this success, now is a great time to give Samus a new action figure - and that's exactly what Good Smile is planning to do. During the online exhibition 'WonHobby35', it announced a Samus Aran figma based on her Metroid Dread design.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

As I got turned to mulch by a mechanical chariot, split in two by an ulcerated lizard, and bullied by a beast man, I simply... gave up. I said to myself, \"I'll come back to this later. Yeah\", with that final \"yeah\" escaping from my lips like a wisp of steam from a kettle.\nThe game boiled me alive, but its open world accommodated these feverish outbursts far better than previous Souls games. There were vast swathes of map to help bring my temperature back down from simmer to sparkling. One thing troubled me, though, and that was the rate at which I'd zip between bosses in-between distractions. It felt like I lacked the focus needed to keep up with Elden Ring's open world.\nRead more",

You're the decision maker of an energy company, tasked solely with providing electricity to towns you have no control over. Do a good job and you'll make enough money to scale up alongside the village/town/city. For such a simple premise it's surprisingly good at engaging the part of your brain that covers strategy and puzzles.

          "description": "Whenever a game like Lost Ark comes out, it shows the public is still hungry for something that looks and sounds and plays even a tiny bit like Diablo. Lost Ark does provide what is the crudest part of the appeal of something like Diablo - i.e. a thousand chittering enemies flying at you at once as you vaporise them with minimal clicking - but I wouldn't say it's a lovingly crafted version of it. Like the difference between the Wicked Witch in Snow White and a Halloween costume in a plastic bag labelled Legally Distinct Evil Magic Stepmother. But there are also things I appreciate about Lost Ark in general, and its version of [flaps hands] whatever this is.\nIn the spirit of Lost Ark's slightly older (one might even say dated?) sensibilities, I'm going to break it down like I'm reviewing the game in a 90s game mag, separating the game into its constituent parts - just as one can remove the egg from a cake after baking it. Although I should make it clear I'm not doing our proper Lost Ark review. That honour falls to Ed, who is more plugged in to modern MMORPGs than I am. I'm just here to talk about how Lost Ark does and does not compare to Diablo - specifically Diablo II, because that's the best one.\nRead more",

It’s as if bass were a grounded concept you’d momentarily left behind - an earthy comfort for mortals. Then the tumble begins, and you’d better have already picked out a nice, safe spot to land. This is the irresistible dichotomy of the parkour game, as first defined by Mirror’s Edge in 2008 - an invitation to soar, with the understanding that true freedom doesn’t come for free. Height is earned, momentum is managed, and mistakes are punished with a 30 foot plunge.\nPerhaps you’ve seen footage of Dying Light 2’s rooftop running and wondered, “How much of that is me?” In a medium where climbing systems are typically automated rather than simulated, and first-person control tends to end at the waist, it’s natural to suspect that what you’re seeing is a fancy set of animations, triggered by pointing your character in a given direction and holding down the parkour key. I’m here to tell you that Dying Light 2 is not that game: it’s the real deal. It is, among many other things, Mirror’s Edge.\nRead more",

We discuss some of our favourite examples of the plote device in question to be found in video games, which of course leads to some interesting discussions about what even is a MacGuffin. Can a MacGuffin be intangible? No, probably not.\nWe discuss whether any MacGuffin is improved by replacing it with an egg (yes), why a lot of games have souls as MacGuffins, and what our own personal MacGuffins would be. Plus! Impressions of Henry \"Vitamin H\" Cavill, and sensational new character Sir Terence Plunder. Will Sir T become a podcast regular? Only time will tell. There is no Cavern Of Lies this week, but in a shocking turn of events it's because Nate forgot, not because I forgot. Hooray!\nRead more",

And now it can, for Dying Light 2’s 1.04 update is live, and sharpens Nvidia’s upscaling tech to close that gap between the rendering and native resolutions. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Specifically work at, rather than participate in. They serve drinks and clean wipe-down sofas for minimum wage, and they don't particularly want to be wearing a latex catsuit, but here we are. \nFor example, I'm pretty sure my gunslinger character works at a steampunk cowboy themed erotique parlour. I actually quite enjoy her attack style, a sort of hyper-aggressive DPS that allows her to switch between three different gun stances (pistols, shotgun and rifle). The dual pistols in particular come with a load of crowd-control AOE attacks like explosions and spinning  bullets firing smaller bullets, or something. And while there is some kind of story involving demons and a war and bits of stone (something something destiny), my gunslinger's quest is, currently, the single-minded pursuit of a pair of trousers.\nRead more",

Rather than have you traipsing around the map in search of trouble to make, there is a refreshing focus on defence – offence’s nerdy younger sister –  with victory determined not by how well you’ve conquered the surrounding land, but how capable you are of taking a beating and coming out on top. \r\n\n \nRead more",

The poor thing was clutching a Vox Stave, and so removing his arm removed the use of his scariest abilities - although in this case the dismemberment proved academic, because it also left him exposed to immediate melee execution. That left our Interceptor free to shoot a nearby statue down on top of a cultist before stabbing him and his friend to death, which in turn gave our Apothecary enough space to chuck a grenade at a bridge and send three Poxwalkers plummeting to their doom. \nI’m no Warhammermun. Those proper nouns are all cosmic Greek to me, but I’m relieved to report they didn't obscure the promise within the 30 minutes of Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters I was shown last week. This is fast-paced XCOM in space, with extensively destructible terrain, an intriguing dual focus on ranged and melee combat, and not a miss chance in sight.

(In fact, I ended up downloading the game because it streamed fine at like 10am but at peak times it went all pixely, like someone had huffed on my glasses.)\nReader, I bloody love Death's Door. Like Katharine said, it's kind of a more gentle Soulslike, with a Studio Ghibli-esque flair to the character design and world.

If she's not throwing her arms out like an aeroplane when she's running up and down the yellowing hills of this sleepy little island village, she's doing a jolly little skip that is probably the most delightful thing I've ever seen in a video game. In fairness, the whole game is just pure joy distilled into a chill wildlife photography adventure, but man alive, the skipping is something else. More of this please, developers.\nRead more",

For eight years they've focused on adding new content to the MMO-y GTA Online mode, which seems a licence to print money by selling in-game cash for real cash. This has made some fans ornery, wondering if they'll just keep on plugging away at GTAO forever, especially with GTAV coming to next-gen consoles this year. But no, really, Rockstar say they really have been making a new one.\nRead more",

          "description": "Ghostwire: Tokyo is an upcoming action-adventure game from Tango Gameworks (aka the folks behind The Evil Within), which means it has ghosts and ghost-adjacent monsters in it. Last night Bethesda showed off a bit more of the game with a streamed showcase, with a ten minute breakdown of the game in action. I, however, was privy to a hands-off presentation that comprised a whole half an hour of Ghostwire Tokyo being played. What luxury!\nIt reminded me much less of The Evil Within than I expected. It has a lot of horror elements, don't get me wrong, but Ghostwire: Tokyo is much more of an action game using the language of horror to convey its themes than the other way around. Rather than spending most of your time on the back foot, creeping around in the hope you can get past a lumbering ball of dead lady limbs with most of your health intact, time in Ghostwire: Tokyo is more likely spent one-shotting headless demon schoolgirls with a bow and arrow. The general vibe, if not the specifics, reminded me a lot of classic, thundering 90s and 00s action films like Blade. So, in other words, Ghostwire: Tokyo looks rad as hell. Even better, it's also unashamedly strange.\nRead more",

Their mod, the Resident Evil 4 HD Project, is out now, and I think it's the most impressive remaster mod ever made. In replacing the game's textures and models with high-def versions, they've tried hard to replicate both the form and the style, and even tracked down locations and objects Capcom had photographed to work into textures.

For every character that I found charming, there was some voiceover that was jarring. For every area that was absolutely gorgeous there was a part of the script that made me extremely grateful for having editors on all my writing.

Fortunately, thanks to kernel improvements since Linux 5.16, that is largely no longer the case. Here is a fresh look at the i9-12900K performance under Ubuntu 22.04 daily with Linux 5.16 and 5.17-rc3 kernels tested as well and Clear Linux for Intel's very own reference Linux platform.",

          "description": "The first Pokémon Trading Card Game expansion of 2022 is finally ready to launch, and as such, we're here to crack open a ton of booster packs for the Sword & Shield – Brilliant Stars expansion. The expansion includes more 170 cards, including 4 Pokémon VStar cards, 20 Pokémon V, and 3 Pokémon VMax cards. In addition, Brilliant Stars features 30 Trainer Gallery cards with special art, more than 20 Trainer cards, and a new Special Energy card.\nWe were sent a ton of booster packs for the Sword & Shield – Brilliant Stars expansion. When I opened up all the packs and sorted through my pulls, I was pleased with the generational spread. While Kanto and Galar Pokémon continue to be well-represented, I noticed more Sinnoh monsters this time around. With Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl hitting just last year, and Legends: Arceus launching last month, this feels like a smart move.\nMy favorite cards this time around happen to fall into the Gen I category. While it's true I hold Gen I in the highest regard (thanks mostly to nostalgia), I like to think that these cards are my favorites not because of that nostalgia, but instead due to the classic-facing designs of these full-art cards. The clean art of the Pikachu V and Raichu V cards immediately caught my eye, and I always consider it a great day when I can pull a Charizard. Of course, having just put a ton of hours into Pokémon Legends: Arceus, it was cool to also pull the titular Pocket Monster from these packs. I also really like some of the Trainer cards included in this expansion, which is not something I can say about every set.\nYou can see the more than 20 cards I deemed my favorites in the gallery below.\nClick here to view embedded media\n \n\nThe Pokémon Trading Card Game: Sword & Shield – Brilliant Stars launches on February 25.

          "description": "Click here to watch embedded media\nSince retro games became, well, retro, many studios making games today have attempted to emulate the music, art, style, and feel of classics like Castlevania, Super Metroid, and others. Nostalgia for games like that helps them a lot in many cases, but that only gets you so far – at the end of the day, you do actually need to create a great game when attempting to dig back into the treasure chest that is 8-bit and 16-bit action-adventure gameplay. I'm happy to report that Berzerk Studio's Infernax, which hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on February 14, has been a blast so far. \nWhile I've not completed the game just yet, there's plenty within that I want to keep a secret for yourself to view in the full game. However, if you've not heard of Infernax or are looking for more information about it, we have you covered with the first 15 minutes of the game (and if you're anything like me, these first 15 minutes will sell you on the game quite well). \nIn this New Gameplay Today, your hosts Wesley LeBlanc, Ben Reeves, and Marcus Stewart talk and walk you through the first 15 minutes of Infernax. Is it hitting the highs of the games it's inspired by? Find out in this special preview video. Thanks for watching and be sure to let us know what you think of Infernax.",

In response, Head of Xbox Phil Spencer confirmed that popular titles like Call of Duty would remain multiplatform. However, at the end of that same statement, Spencer briefly voiced Microsoft's interest \"in taking similar steps to support Nintendo's successful platform.\" While this leaves room for interpretation, a recent CNBC interview doubles down on Spencer's final remarks meaning Microsoft might bring Call of Duty to Switch. \nIt is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard at this time regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over-reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the suit focuses on \"violations of the state's civil rights and equal pay laws,\" specifically regarding the treatment of women and other marginalized groups. To learn more about the proceedings thus far, including details listed in the lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, please check out our previous coverage here.\n\nAccording to a Eurogamer report, Microsoft's President Brad Smith told CNBC, \"We'd like to bring [Call of Duty] to Nintendo devices. We'd like to bring the other popular titles that Activision Blizzard has, and ensure that they continue to be available on PlayStation, [and] that they become available on Nintendo.\" Of course, this doesn't necessarily mean that future or current Call of Duty games will be developed with the Switch in mind. Still, Spencer and Smith's words might indicate a future where Call of Duty is readily available on every platform. \nClick here to watch embedded media\nWould you dive right in if Call of Duty was ported to Switch?

So, it’s no surprise that fans are still taking to the high-speed tracks of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe almost five years after its initial launch. Luckily, more content/support is coming that will make the eighth entry feel like a brand new chapter in the Kart-racing franchise. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe – Booster Course Pass is on the way and promises a whopping 48 extra courses by 2023.\nClick here to watch embedded media\nThese courses will release in six total waves, with the first wave dropping on March 18. Wave 1 includes an exciting mixture of classic and recent maps like Paris Promenade, Toad Circuit, Choco Mountain, Coconut Mall, Tokyo Blur, Shroom Ridge, Sky Garden, and Ninja Hideaway. If you already have a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion membership, you’ll get instant access to the Booster Course Pass when the first wave is available in a few months. You can also pre-order it for $25.\nWe loved Mario Kart 8 Deluxe as much as its dedicated fandom. Brian Shea concluded his review by saying: \n“Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is primarily a re-release of an acclaimed game from three years ago, but by adding new content and addressing the biggest complaint of the original, this version is unquestionably the best way to experience Nintendo's great racer. Battle mode is back to its original glory, and when combined with the rest of the robust Mario Kart 8 package, it creates a great addition to the fledgling Switch library.”\n\n\nWhat tracks are you hoping to see throughout the year?

That compilation disc included five rudimentary sports titles and showed players the capabilities of the Wii's then-groundbreaking motion controls. It was an immediate smash hit, attracting demographics that extended far beyond Nintendo's typical gaming audience. However, while the Nintendo Switch has now outsold the wildly popular Wii and it has its fair share of wide-reaching smash hits like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Animal Crossing: New Horizons, the console/handheld hybrid hasn't had another transcendent game experience like the original Wii Sports. Now, with the aptly named Nintendo Switch Sports, fans of Wii Sports can relive past glories.\nNintendo Switch Sports gathers six sports and lets you control them using the motion controls of the Switch Joy-Cons. Tennis, bowling, and chambara (swordplay) all return to the Sports series, while this iteration adds soccer, volleyball, and badminton. If you buy the physical version of Nintendo Switch Sports, you also receive a Leg Strap accessory that allows your Joy-Con to track your leg, which can be used in soccer's Shootout Mode.\nYou can play in-person with family and friends like the original Wii Sports or play online in ranked matchmaking or against friends on your Nintendo Switch Online list. Two free updates were also announced for Nintendo Switch Sports. The first one, coming this summer, adds the ability to use the Leg Strap peripheral for the main game of soccer. This fall, another free update will add golf to the collection of sports you can play.\nNintendo Switch Sports arrives on Switch on April 29. If you'd like to check it out before then, Nintendo is hosting a special online play test from February 18 to 20, where Nintendo Switch Online subscribers can play bowling, chambara, and tennis.",

Nintendo announced the SNES classic Earthbound is finally making its way to Switch, and its NES prequel dubbed Earthbound Beginnings will be joining it.\nEarthbound will be available as part of the Nintendo Switch Online SNES collection, being added to the service for no additional cost. Likewise, Earthbound Beginnings will become a new part of the Switch's NES collection. \nFor those unfamiliar with Earthbound, it's a 1994 JRPG that follows a small-town boy named Ness who is tasked by a time-traveling bee to save the world from an alien invasion. Along his travels across the globe, he meets plenty of strange characters and forms a party with three other very capable children. In Japan, it's known as Mother 2, although it's the first of the series that made its way stateside.\nEarthbound Beginnings is the original Mother title that didn't see release outside of Japan for 16 years. The 1989 JRPG was localized and released on Wii U in 2015. Like Earthbound, you play as a seemingly normal kid named Ninten with psychic powers who goes on a strange adventure. This is the second time Earthbound Beginnings has been made available, skipping release on 3DS and the NES Classic.\nHopefully, the release of these absolute classics will open the door for Mother 3 to see the light of day outside of Japan in some way.

In Car Mode, Kirby can race around the level, ramming through any enemies in his way. \nClick here to watch embedded media\nThe trailer revealed many other mouth forms like Vending Mouth, which sees Kirby suck up a vending machine that allows him to shoot juice cans at enemies, Cone Mouth, which lets him spike down on something after sucking up a cone, and more.

Announced at today's Nintendo Direct, a remake of Front Mission 2 has also been announced to come to Switch at a later point in the future. Check out the entire announcement trailer below!\nClick here to watch embedded media\nFront Mission is an interesting choice to resurrect into relevancy in 2022. If you ever wanted to dive into tactical RPG mech combat, Front Mission might be the place to do it. Position and move your troops around the battlefield and strategically target the opponent's various Wanzer points to gain the edge in combat. Blast off arms, legs, and other smart targets to take your enemies out quickly – or deny them access to their dangerous weapons. For all the love the series has, many Front Mission titles are not released outside of Japan. Perhaps this remake will bring some more attention to the mechanized warfare franchise!",

It's back in Three Hopes, which will bring Byleth, Edelgard, Dimitri, Claude, and all of your favorite students and teachers from Three Houses back for the fight. Despite having the \"Fire Emblem Warriors\" name, this is not DLC – it's a brand-new game. It will be released on June 24 on the Nintendo Switch, so you won't have to wait too much longer now. \nClick here to watch embedded media\nAs for what to expect, Three Hopes sees the characters of the mainline Fire Emblem: Three Houses game return in a Musou format. If you're not familiar with that genre, you control a character who essentially wrecks through dozens of enemies at a time. It won't feature Fire Emblem's rock-paper-scissors combat as a result and will be much more action-focused. \nAs you'd expect with the name, in this Warriors game, you'll be fighting enemies at the Monastery, on familiar battlefields, and more. It's unclear when in the timeline of Three Houses this game takes place. Those familiar with the original game can probably suss out when this game takes place, considering some of the events of that narrative. Only time will tell. \nWhile waiting for its June 24 release, read Game Informer's Fire Emblem Warriors review and check out Game Informer's Fire Emblem: Three Houses review. \nAre you excited for Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Houses?

          "description": "When Microsoft announced its plans to purchase Activision Blizzard, one of the first questions was whether Call of Duty and the publisher's other existing titles would eventually become Xbox exclusives. Head of Xbox Phil Spencer quickly stated that Microsoft plans to honor existing contractual agreements between Sony and Activision regarding Call of Duty specifically and vaguely expressed a desire to keep the series on PlayStation. \nThough pretty definitive, the second bit of Phil's statement left room for interpretation. A new blog post by Microsoft further clarifies its commitment to keeping Activision Blizzard titles multiplatform. The post, which discusses a new set of Microsoft Store principles in preparation for the Activision acquisition approval process, says the following:\nIn short, Microsoft will continue to allow future Call of Duty entries and other titles to remain multiplatform even after they're not legally required to. You can still interpret this message to refer to existing franchises with established fanbases. New IPs could be a different story. But for now, those who want to continue playing Overwatch, Diablo, or Crash Bandicoot on multiple consoles seemingly have nothing to worry about in the long term. \nAs a reminder, assuming Microsoft's acquisition passes the lengthy government approval process, the deal isn't expected to close until around the summer of 2023. Activision Blizzard continues to operate as an independent entity until that time. If/when that happens, it's good to know that whatever dead Activision franchises Microsoft chooses to resurrect have a strong chance of appearing on non-Xbox platforms.",

We know Kirby and the Forgotten Land and Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp fit within that timeframe, so it would make sense to get new looks at the exciting new Switch titles. \nNintendo has also been steadily dropping new N64 games for Switch Online. A Direct would be a good time to continue that trend (here's hoping for Pokémon Stadium and Pokémon Snap to celebrate the upcoming Pokémon Day on February 27). Will any of the games I listed in the first paragraph make an appearance? Probably not, or maybe yes?
