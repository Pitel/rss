          "description": "\"A unicorn is worth more than riches\".\nIn 2009, in the run-up to Christmas, I remember poring over a recent issue of Official Nintendo Magazine looking for games I might want for the holiday season. Flicking through the pages and taking in every single word, one review in particular jumped out at me. The art style was something I’d never seen in a video game before. I was obsessed with Japanese folklore at the time. And, even though the gameplay sounded like nothing new, it scratched my 2D action-platformer itch.\nThat review was for Muramasa: The Demon Blade, and this was my first brush with Vanillaware. My love of the Osaka-based developer, and this game in particular, is documented, but it was established at the very moment I saw Muramasa on the TV screen, with Edo Japan rendered in beautiful watercolour visuals. Vanillaware has always been known as the studio that makes pretty games with pretty food – and, sometimes, the studio that gives us, um, very exaggerated art – but over the past four years, I’ve seen a real shift in appreciation that I’ve been hoping for.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

My weakest skeletons, sensing their death coming, explode into fire and shards. My strongest skeletons fight so hard and with such alacrity that upon dying, they drag their spirits together and keep fighting as ghosts for a while. Foul little bone scorpions skitter around on fans of legs made from human hands. Somewhere in the middle, almost invisible among the noise, is the character I am actually playing: Path of Exile 2’s mean-spirited, callous, and gleefully enjoyable Witch.\nThis is a review in progress. It has to be. Even in its incomplete early access period, Path of Exile 2 is a great sprawling mass of a game. Three meaty acts of a planned six act campaign are followed by a trickier return tour through them, before the absurd endgame kicks into gear and the real work begins. If I came to you having played everything on offer I would be wild-haired, bloodshot-eyed and possessing perfect, incomprehensible knowledge. Let’s compromise: I have toured the dark caverns and the antediluvian crypts. I have been killed by various accumulated nasties. I’ve had a great time.\nRead more",

          "description": "The announcement of The Witcher 4 with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's Ciri as protagonist has attracted a bit of discussion. Some of the reaction is online toddlers waxing wroth about a video game having a (somewhat older!!!) woman as lead character, and especially, shock, a video game in a series that has hitherto starred a man. And some of it is people commenting more thoughtfully on whether Ciri genuinely makes for a suitable Witcher protagonist, given that she isn't the product of the typical Witcher genetic modification regime (which is heavily tailored towards men), and given that, without spoiling too much, she has gifts that make crumbly old Geralt's sword-and-sorcery skillset look rather paltry. \r\n\n\nSpeaking to Eurogamer this week, game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber responded to a few of these comments, and also shared a little about Ciri's situation at the start of the game.\r\n \nRead more",

Later, I examined the senator's personal history more thoroughly and discovered he was \"hated by bears for cooking them a rancid meal.\" I suppose every politician has their enemies. \nThat Caves Of Qud creates fun anecdotes out of simple encounters shouldn't be a surprise. It has had 15 years of early access to establish itself as a small-but-mighty story generating roguelike of repute (there's a reason it sits deservedly side-by-side with Dwarf Fortress in the same publishing house). After creating many characters, and dying and dying and dying again, I understand why it grips the brain with such fierce glee. It is a machine of grand imagination and adventuresome comedy. A deceptively powerful RPG that isn't half as obtuse to newcomers as the screenshots make it out to be. Qud's low-res bark is just a complement to its bite.\nRead more",

Sony and Kadokawa were reported to be in talks last month, fomenting all sorts of speculation about, say, the PC version of Bloodborne being ritually sacrificed to consecrate the PS6-exclusivity of Dark Souls 4. Now, the pair have emerged from the Cave of Haggling and announced... \"a strategic capital and business alliance agreement\". What does this mean? Is it safe to scream yet?\r\n \nRead more",

With one of their electronic tracking collars in hand and absolutely no preexisting knowledge of their location, I set out to find this kindred spirit, only for the Zone to once again slam a door in my face.\nA cold, steel, very literal door to boot. It turns out that the scientist’s laboratory is locked up tight, and will remain so until I delve about twenty hours deeper into the faction war that’s bubbled up while I’ve been running around throwing irradiated rats at people in tracksuits.

It's now going to include new moves, stages, costumes, and a chaotic-looking 2v2 multiplayer tag team mode. All good news for biff 'em up sickos, as the mod is due to release on Friday. \nRead more",

          "description": "A master thief creeps over cobbles in an early modern metropolis that splits the difference between Edinburgh, Glasgow and Liverpool. Lit by gaslamps that can’t quite dispel the industrial haze, they pass for a civilian - a rough one, admittedly, but not shady enough to cause an itch in the swordarm of any passing guard.\nUntil, that is, they take to the thieves’ highway - following the trajectory of their grappling hook upward to the rooftops, from which they can see the shape of the city, and the moon beyond. Up here, it’s a parallel world - the trees on street level answered by chimney stacks, and the distant hills echoed by the rise and fall of steep gables. “We’re super proud of these rooftops,” says Greg LoPiccolo. “It’s an amazing landscape that we put a lot of thought and effort into, and it’s a lot of fun to traverse.”\nBack in 1998, LoPiccolo was the game director who saw Thief: The Dark Project to completion. Today - after an 18 year detour to Harmonix to lead projects like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, among other adventures - he’s the game director of Thick as Thieves. “It really is an opportunity to do something unique and cool and new, on the shoulders of this stuff that is now well-respected,” he says. “Thief has some legs, right? People still talk about it to some degree.”\nRead more",

Fights are like if you took a MOBA and forced both teams to bash heads constantly. Success lies in picking off Spider-Man or Squirrel Girl or Marcus Fenix so as they wait to respawn, you hop on the big area that needs capturing. Or you push the cart while tanky Hulk absorbs bullets with his biceps and John Marvel snipes from afar.\nThe more I played Rivals, though, the more it hit me that it's specifically a messier, more complex Overwatch. A hero shooter with a surprising amount of polish and charm, sure, but also one that slides off my brain like water off Birdman's back. I understand why it's supremely popular at the moment and yet, I really don't.\nRead more",

          "description": "In more ways than one, today’s Total War: Warhammer 3 expansion marks a milestone for game director Rich Aldridge and his team at Creative Assembly. Omens Of Destruction’s three headline legendary lords each bring new campaigns and units for their respective factions, but it’s the fourth lord - a Khorne champion free to all players - that I imagine Aldridge will end up remembering the most fondly.\nWhen Total War: Warhammer released back in 2016, it shipped with eight legendary lords - famous characters from Games Workshop’s fantasy setting that here act as faction leaders. The number grew steadily and, in terms of announcement order at least, today’s addition of Arbaal The Undefeated marks the series’ 100th. That's a hundred campaigns, a hundred joint efforts of game design, animation, art, writing and voice work.\nAldridge has never been shy about the team’s ambition for the series to eventually offer up each unit from every Fantasy Battle 6th edition army book (\"The goal is to do everything, right?\"). But ambition is one thing, and considering the fraught conditions at Creative Assembly and parent company Sega over the past few years, it’s not just the addition of the 100th lord that feels like something to celebrate. It’s taken time, effort, and a siesmic shift in update frequency, but Total War: Warhammer III is in the best place it's ever been.\nRead more",

It's currently fourth on the Steam daily most played, right between Path Of Exile 2 and the evergreen Grand Theft Auto 5. I think there are three reasons for this enthusiasm: 1) it's free-to-play with the usual comet's tail of microtransactables 2) it's third-person Overwatch with Marvel characters, a straightforwardly enticing licensing sandwich, and 3) people want to have sex with a larger-than-usual proportion of the cast and especially awful tongue-monster Venom, who has a good butt in this one. No, I'm not going to share pictures. You'll have to google that filth yourself.\r\n\n\r\nBut perhaps you are a sophisticated soul who has no time for such salacious nonsense. You're more interested in hearing how they're patching the thing. Enough with the butts already, dang it - this is a new multiplayer game so there must, of course, be patches!

It's like offering somebody a cake that is actually a cunningly painted hunk of torpedo fuselage. It's like offering to shake hands while wearing one of those comedy hand buzzers - except that the hand buzzer is an intricate simulation of zero-G physics, missile behaviours and comms jamming, featuring spacecraft with proper internal layouts that require you to think hard about attitude control if you don't want, say, your engines to become Swiss cheese about 90 seconds before you need to retreat from combat. \r\n\n\r\nBeing a \"true\" 3D real-time space strategy game, Nebulous looks and sounds a lot like Homeworld on the surface, but it's nothing like as straightforward. It is systems within systems. It is a game in which you can, theoretically, plot the path of a single guided munition through an asteroid field, so as to catch an enemy cruiser in the back. I barely understand how to make a ship fire on another ship, using plain old armour-piercing shells, and now they're threatening to add carriers, fighters and bombers. Customisable ones!

It is a dusty brown, a damp brown, a hot and earthy brown that hums with the stinging malodour of disturbed ancient moss where once old forests stood. Descending into Gatwick’s cloying brown from 33,000 feet is like flying under and up Gandalf’s wretched cloak and landing in one of the several horrible little magic pouches he keeps by his balls.\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator 2024 captures Gatwick’s brown perfectly. Next to the stupefying natural beauty of Yosemite, the imposing imperial skyscrapers of the Manhattan skyline and the surging majesty of the Alpine peaks, this local rot-tinged patch of West Sussex is the most impressively realistic depiction of a place I have seen in a game.\nRead more",

          "description": "It's not just because he's a Nazi. It's because he's a smartass Nazi. As the main antagonist in Indiana Jones And The Great Circle, Emmerich Voss vacates the archetypal armchair usually reserved for secondary fascist goons, so that he can goosestep straight into the big boy seat himself. He smiles with all the sleaze of right-hand-man Major Toht, the grubby gestapo who gets that right hand burned in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Yet he also engages in the pseudo-intellectual trash talk of the main archaeological rivals to Jones, like Rene Belloq or Walter Donovan. He is a hideous grab bag of all the things that make an instantly detestable villain in the series. But there's something else. Voss is so immediately and gutturally hateable because he resembles a type of racist encountered not in the 1930s, but one you've probably met today: the asshole you meet on the internet.\nWarning: Here be spoilers.\nRead more",

          "description": "The only sound that greets you upon booting up Eclipsium is a loudly throbbing heart. As one must when encountering horror media, the game and I immediately enter a spiritual staring contest, each of us knowing the real game here was it trying to freak me out. \"It’s fine\", I decided. \"It’s just a heart! I’ve got a heart. It’s actually very useful. Nothing to be scared of\". Thing is, Eclipsium’s menu heart is actually massive and sits, like The Eye Of Sauron, atop a giant obelisk. “Ah. That’s definitely a horror thing, that” I was forced to admit. \"If my heart was on a giant obelisk, I’d be proper shaken up, I reckon.\"\nSo starts Eclipsium’s very first bit of aggressive disorientation, and it basically just escalates from there. I obviously can’t describe the vibes without slightly spoiling the vibes, so do pop over to Steam for a demo if you’re curious and, oh, there’s a potted plant, the sound of its rustling mixed in such a way that it sort of sounds like it’s shrieking at me. Well.\nRead more",

          "description": "“Hang on a sec. Haven’t I seen this exact genre of little guy before?” was my reaction upon encountering the yellow-eyed, hat-shrouded mage of isometric adventure Oolo. Some quick internet sleuthing turned up this lovely bit of art featuring Final Fantasy 9’s Vivi, Journey’s Traveller, and He-Man’s Orko. It’s a great feeling to begin your week identifying an archetype of diminutive magician, and I hope it becomes a regular occurrence. Another pleasant  discovery was Oolo itself, which you can discover yourself through the shrouded magic of this link to it’s free demo.\n(Do I need to keep writing ‘free demo’, by the way? I tend to alternate. It’s obviously redundant but I feel writing ‘free’ gives it a certain gravitas. Free tax rebate. Free sunrise. Free oxygen. It makes things sound better.)\nRead more",

Dále tvrdil, že WP Engine porušuje ochranné známky WordPressu, které jsou v držení nadace WordPress Foundation, ale výhradní licenci na ně má společnost Automattic. Požadoval, aby společnost WP Engine platila licenční poplatky ve výši 8 % svých ročních příjmů ve výši 400 milionů dolarů, tedy přibližně 32 milionů dolarů ročně.",

These coolers worked well with 400 Watt EPYC processors and especially the XE360-SP5 all-in-one liquid cooling was very performant and practical with today's server CPU TDPs ever increasing. After that SilverStone mentioned to me they had a new heatsink that could run up to 13 degrees cooler than the XE04-SP5 4U air cooler... Talk about intriguing. Meet the new SilverStone XED120S-WS for high-end air cooling for up to 450 Watt processors while working with multiple Intel and AMD CPU sockets.",

The Intel Arc B580 graphics showed some nice generational uplift under Linux for most workloads but there were some anomalies where clearly the Intel Linux graphics driver had room to better optimize the new Xe2/Battlemage graphics support. Windows benchmarks of the Intel Arc B580 also showed it performing more competitively to the likes of the GeForce RTX 4060 compared to what I was seeing under Linux. Thus I spent the past few days working on some Windows 11 vs. Ubuntu Linux graphics benchmarks for both Intel Arc Graphics of Alchemist and Battlemage GPUs to see how the performance compares.",

          "description": "Looking back at the past few years, 2024's choices for the best PC games are full of solid options. Some have entertaining combat mechanics, while others tug at your heartstrings and make you contemplate life. Nonetheless, several shone through as superb this year, with Destructoid's choice for the best PC game of 2024 being none other than Metaphor: ReFantazio.\n\n\n\n\nThe inspiration from ATLUS' Shin Megami Tensei and Persona series is almost immediately apparent, but there's enough present to help Metaphor stand out from the ground. You still have SMT and Persona-like combat mechanics, with Archetypes taking center stage and allowing for more customization than usual. Nonetheless, the overall vibe has shifted from chill high school adventures to a medieval-themed world where a young protago…",

          "description": "By now, we've all grown accustomed to apps and websites giving us a brief overview of how we've been using their services across the year, and Steam is no different. Just like how Spotify Wrapped gives you a breakdown of how many mushy Phil Collins songs you've listened to throughout the year (just me?), Steam Replay 2024 tells you your gaming habits over the past 12 months.\n\n\nWhen you next log in, you'll get to access your summary, which – as described in a recent post – is \"fun-filled, fact-filled, friend-filled.\" In no way does it make me judge myself. Nope. Not a bit.\n\n\n\n\nYou probably don't need me to go over exactly what you can expect to find in Replay, but these end-of-year digests can provide an interesting insight into what kind of games you play and/or what kind of gamer Steam sees you as. Your mileage will vary, obviously.\n\n\nHow many games did you play in 2024?\n\n\nI was in two minds about whether or not to share mine with you all. There's nothing really embarrassing about it. And now that I've said that, I feel I've inadvertently implicated myself and the only way to clear my name is to link to my Steam Replay.\n\n\nActually, no. Still not doing it. However, what I did find interesting about my summary is how Supermarket Simulator is wedged right between Phasmophobia and 7 Days to Die. The first two are not surprising, but I didn't think I'd played the latter that much this year. Clearly, Steam says otherwise.\n\n\nScreenshot via Destructoid.\n\n\nI'm also not surprised to see that horror dominates my playing habits. This has been typical with me over the three years Steam Replay has been running. I also see that survival, classic, and FPS form a big part of my preferences. Yep, yep. These all check out, too. But as you can see, absolutely nothing there that would make someone raise their eyebrows at me. Just good old violence and horror.\n\nThe post Steam Replay 2024 recaps your year in gaming – how does yours look? appeared first on Destructoid.",

Festivities center around Florawish, with multiple new NPCs to talk to. \n\n\nOne of the event quests involves Emabul, who can be found close to the Mayor’s Residence Warp Spire in Florawish, outside of Ray and Wing’s. If you can’t quite find her, I’ve marked the location on the map below:\n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nEmabul wants this her first Companion Day with Jumpy to be perfect, and talking to her will spark a limited-time Kindled Inspiration quest called “Friendship Glow”, and as with all Kindled Inspiration quests, you’ll need to equip a certain item to complete the quest. \n\n\nHow to complete Kindled Inspiration: Friendship Glow in Infinity Nikki\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe item that you need to equip to complete this quest is called “Twinkling Refractions”, and can be found in the Hair Accessories section of the wardrobe. It’s a golden bunny shaped hairclip that will position itself in the front of Nikki’s head when equipped, and it does bear an uncanny resemblance to a Bunny.\n\n\nWhile a lot of Kindled Inspiration quests require you to go out of your way to get the item needed, the Twinkling Refractions accessory is actually remarkably easy to get, especially if you’ve been playing for any length of time. \n\n\nHow to get Twinkling Refractions in Infinity Nikki\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe Twinkling Refractions hair accessory is unlocked by default as part of the Bubbly Voyage Ability Outfit, which allows Nikki to glide through the air and is the first Ability Outfit that is unlocked as soon as you arrive in Miraland. \n\n\nIf you’ve made it as far as Florawish, then you’ve definitely unlocked this outfit. All you need to do is equip it as part of your basic outfit and you’ll be able to complete this Companion Day event quest. \n\nThe post How to complete Kindled Inspiration: Friendship Glow in Infinity Nikki appeared first on Destructoid.",

Rockstar's epic Western world takes on a distinctive winter feel, with snowy landscapes, frozen lakes, and custom weather cycles making for a brand-new experience. \n\n\nThe world's temperature has been affected, too, so you'll need to make sure Arthur Morgan is wrapped up, or else he'll receive negative status effects that will make your playthrough even harder.\n\n\n\nImage via RichardHertz/Nexus Mods\n\n\nImage via RichardHertz/Nexus Mods\n\n\nImage via RichardHertz/Nexus Mods\n\n\nImage via RichardHertz/Nexus Mods\n\n\n\nBy far the most significant change is what RichardHertz has done to Saint Denis. Beyond just the snow, the large industrial city has also been given plenty of festive decor, making it truly feel like Christmas has come to Red Dead Redemption 2. It has been designed with existing weather mods in mind, so you can use this without worrying about compatibility issues, too.\n\n\nI've been using this mod at the start of a new playthrough and can personally vouch for this one. The only issue is that NPCs won't use their winter outfits, which can be slightly immersion-breaking. If you can look past that, Snow - The Definitive Singleplayer Snow Mod is the best of its ilk. It even considers isolated areas where story missions take place, \"ensuring the full game can be played seamlessly in winter mode.\"\n\nThe post New Red Dead Redemption 2 mod turns the Wild West into a winter wonderland appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Companion's Day in Infinity Nikki has added a few new quests, and the Photo Investigation: The Floof Triplets is arguably one of the cutest additions you can find.\n\n\nLike other investigative quests, you'll have to find certain items and take their snaps to complete the mission. In this case, however, you're not clicking any inanimate object. Instead, you will be taking snaps of three cute kittens and deciphering the correct one from three identical triplets. Naturally, it's not as easy as you first think, and here's how you can complete this specific quest.\n\n\nPhoto Investigation: The Floof Triplets quest location in Infinity Nikki\n\n\nYou can begin this quest at Florawish, right across the Stylist Guild. You can find the spot near the Whimscotch playing field, where you'll find Fresnay sitting in front of the kiosks (marked in the blue box). \n\n\nImage via Destructoid\n\n\nThis specific quest doesn't have any prerequisite at all, and anyone can complete it. Whether you're someone who has started playing recently or spent the last couple of weeks grinding out the content, this quest is the perfect addition. That said, the Companion's Day quests are going to be a time-limited affair, and they will be available till the end of the event on December 30, 2024. Hence, try to complete this and all the other Comapnion's Day quests as soon as possible.\n\n\nHow to complete the Photo Investigation: The Floof Triplets in Infinity Nikki\n\n\nThe main objective is to take a snap of the pup who is called Ace. The other two, Deuce and Trey, can also be found in the same spot, but they aren't part of the quest. The only clue you have about Ace is the fact that he loves to hide. Hence, he's the one sitting near the purple flowers.\n\n\nOnce you take a snap of Ace, the quest is complete, and you'll get 100 Thread of Purity and 30 Diamonds as part of the total quest rewards.\n\nThe post How to find Photo Investigation: The Floof Triplets in Infinity Nikki appeared first on Destructoid.",

What you might not expect if you didn’t read the headline is that this mode features a crossover with Early Access FPS darling Ultrakill.\n\n\nThat’s the whole of it. So, did you play Mullet MadJack? If not, why not? It’s one of my favorite releases of this year and was a nominee for Destructoid’s Best Indie Game of 2024. It didn’t win (it went to Animal Well), but the competition was fierce. Being among the best game released in a year where small independent studios released some of their best work is no small feat.\n\n\n\n\nPlus, it’s a game that satirizes the current world of endorphins distilled through mindless consumerism and vapid social media. Your goal as moderator is to take out a bunch of rich soulless robots (robillionaires) and save an influencer princess. All this within the never-stop-killing framework of Post Void. It’s stellar. Play it now.\n\n\nI wouldn’t say that Boss Rush is necessary, though. It’s more of a “nice to have.” The bosses in Mullet MadJack weren’t spectacular, but they weren’t bad either. I got a peak at the Boss Rush mode here, and it’s pretty standard. The one weird thing is that there’s no variation. You’re provided the same weapon each time to fight the bosses with. For a roguelite, that’s a bit strange, but, again, it’s a “nice to have.” \n\n\nI’ll be honest: I didn’t make it to Mr. Ultrakill, but I only tried once and lost on the main game’s end, baddie. I haven’t gotten around to playing Ultrakill, while we’re on the subject. I hear it’s spectacular. It just hasn’t yet landed on my list of priorities. Maybe when it hits version 1.0.\n\n\nMullet MadJack is available now on PC.

If you didn't get a chance to find these fish last year, you have another chance to in 2024. \n\n\nAll Festive fish locations in Disney Dreamlight Valley\n\n\nDisney Dreamlight Valley's 2024 Winter event features five festive fish. You'll catch each fish by visiting their biomes and looking for red and green circles in the water. The regular white, orange, and blue colors will give you normal fish instead.\n\n\nBelow is every festive fish and their locations:\n\n\nFish\nLocation\n\n\n\n\nFestive Bass\nPeaceful Meadow\n\n\nFestive Fugu\nDazzle Beach (Raining)\n\n\nFestive Squid\nGlade of Trust\n\n\nFestive Salmon\nSunlit Plateau\n\n\nFestive Anglerfish\nForgotten Lands\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRather than fishing in white, blue, or orange circles like usual, you'll need to look out for sparkling red and green spots in the water. Aside from the changed color palette, the appearance and minigame that follows is the exact same. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nNonetheless, you're not guaranteed to find a fishing spot every time you check one of these biomes. They're not as rare as the Here and There fish, but they're still tough to encounter sometimes. If you're having trouble finding each fish, catch some from other circles and wait for more to respawn before repeating the process. Eventually, one of the circles will be red and green, signaling you're about to get your first festive fish.\n\n\nIf you've yet to complete the Even Fish Are Festive Dreamlight Village task, you'll progress through it with each festive fish you catch. Otherwise, obtaining more won't let you repeat the task, but you'll restore a ton of energy by eating them. Alternatively, you can use them in crafting recipes or cooking like you would with their regular counterparts.\n\nThe post All Festive fish locations in Disney Dreamlight Valley appeared first on Destructoid.",

(with multiplayer support)\nBackyard Basketball.\nUnrest.\nRise of the Dragon.\nCastle Master.\nWait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare. (Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца)\nMask Show. (Маски-шоу)\nMarvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat. (Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы)\nThe Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik.

K písničkám z alba vyšly animované videoklipy, které produkoval Leidži Macumoto, což byl kultovní japonský výtvarník (zemřel loni), který měl na svém kontě mnoho animovaných seriálů, především ze 70. - 80. let (nejslavnější z nich byl asi \"Space Battleship Yamato\").
