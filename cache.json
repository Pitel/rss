It popped up on PC in the last months of 1994, then found its way to PlayStation and other platforms. It didn’t shift millions, but it gained cult status for its unique atmosphere, inventive controls, and memorable story of a despot, a rebellion, and a chosen one. Understanding Twinsen’s Quest really means understanding its origins, so it’s worth a recap.\nLittle Big Adventure was the first game from French studio Adeline Software, followed a few years later by a sequel. Developer  has brought back some of the original team for this remake — including composer Philippe Vachey, revisiting a memorable theme tune — as well as new creatives drawn from the LBA fan community. Designer Didier Chanfray has said that the Little Big Adventure series was always intended to be a trilogy: now the goal is to remake both of the original games in a modern style, before finally completing the set. Exciting stuff for long-time fans.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Time to rewrite history.\nRunning a budding kingdom is hard, but it is made even more difficult by being surrounded on all sides by a host of potential enemies, all vying for land, resources, and power. Few video games have managed to recreate that pressure as well as Koei Tecmo’s Romance of the Three Kingdoms series, with Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 Remake becoming the most balanced version of one of the best games in that franchise. Somehow, they’ve made the tedium of bureaucracy feel fun and addictive.\nLike the rest of the series and the novel that inspired it, Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 Remake — which originally launched in Japan on PC in 2001 before arriving in the West a couple of years later on PS2 — follows a heavily romanticised version of Chinese history. The period from around 220 to 280 AD was a time of huge upheaval for the region, with multiple figures competing for control. That conflict gave birth to figures such as Lu Bu, Dong Zhuo, and Cao Cao, all of whom have become immortalised in novels, films, and, most relevant for us, video games.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Although many (this writer included) were sceptical of Retro Studios’ abilities to move Metroid into the 3D, first-person realm, the team not only managed to put its own spin on an established Nintendo franchise successfully, but it also created one of the greatest games of all time.\nHow the heck are you supposed to top that? Well, Metroid Prime 2: Echoes doesn’t quite reach the same heights as its predecessor, and it’s often regarded as the lesser entry in an eventual trilogy (though to be honest, even the worst Prime game is better than the majority of games out there).

          "description": "I've been trying to work out if I'm keen on Soulframe only because I feel guilty about missing the boat with Warframe. I reviewed Digital Extremes' hit free-to-play shooter in 2013, back when people were still calling it a spiritual successor to the developer's boomerang-throwing action game Dark Sector. I didn't like Warframe much at the time. Think I gave it a 6/10. Warp forward a decade, and that 6/10 game has become a thriving live service phenomenon - fifteenth on the Steam Most Played charts at the time of writing, and profitable enough to spawn its own annual TennoCon expo. It's also become an intoxicating, confusing morass of dynastic sci-fantasy politicking and genre-shifting expansions, ranging from capital ship mechanics to questions of time travel, wrapped in layers of cosmetics that make Destiny look about as colourful as Gears Of War. \r\n\n\r\nI definitely didn't see all that coming. I doubt Digital Extremes saw it coming either. Warframe today feels like a lab experiment run amok. I love its appetite for novelty, but there's a lot for a returning player to catch up on and, frankly, it feels like homework. As such, I had a couple of broad motivations for playing Soulframe's pre-alpha \"prelude\": I'm keen to see what Digital Extremes can do when they aren't encumbered by 10 years of world-building, and I want to get in on the ground floor before they absolutely swamp this thing in updates.\r\n \nRead more",

That is, coming up with a set of game inputs that can win billions of possible permutations of the game, as determined by its RNG, when played simultaneously. It's an impressive feat, but the video itself is great too, patiently breaking down the process with motion graphics and video editing flair. Delightful.\r\n\n \nRead more",

There I was, just starting to get to grips with the card-house-careful balance between each of its units when, bam, makers Game River dropped a Jenga block on top of it. It’s a stealth block, too. Didn’t even see it coming.\nUpdate 1.1’s new unit is the Phantom Ray, which Game River describe as \"a medium-sized aircraft with high HP that excels at striking enemies at close range with high-damage missiles\". It’s a mid-tier flier, costing 50 to unlock and 200 to field, and for that you get three of them per unit. As for default tech, you’ve got some range and fire rate unlocks, alongside an oil drop. The headliner here is the stealth buff, which cloaks the Phantom Ray by default until it attacks. When it does, it all gets a nice 40% bonus to damage.\nRead more",

I wanted to know why I was targeted by such carnal eroticism. I wanted to know more about my character's own relationships. How angels fit into the picture. And why lots of the demons seem quite chill, really.\nBut when it came to the actual survival -  the bit I thought I'd enjoy the most -  I came away a bit disappointed. Exploration is fine, it's just the combat is often too frequent and too frequently irritating. I came to dread the action more than the atmosphere, in the end.\nRead more",

Introduced on Razer’s Huntsman V3 Pro series and quickly followed by Wooting’s (functionally distinct but effectively identical) Rappy Snappy, Snap Tap is now wearing multiple names as it takes over the world of RGB peripherals, from SteelSeries’ Rapid Tap to Corsair’s FlashTap and Keychron’s... Last Keystroke Prioritisation. Which doesn’t sound as sexy, but still.\nHowever, Snap Tap is also drawing a level of ire that exceeds the usual baseline scepticism of hardware marketing. Because it enables a form of input automation – where you can quickly move in two directions by rapidly tapping one key, while holding down another – it’s considered by some as tantamount to cheating, allowing players to cross the line that divides unfair play from the accepted comforts that come with simply using a responsive Hall Effect keyboard or high-refresh-rate monitor. It’s even become a bannable offence in certain games, most notably in Counter-Strike 2.\nNeither side is backing down; in an astonishingly worded tweet, Wooting went as far as to concede Snap Tap \"should be considered cheating. But if it’s allowed, you need it.\" But do you?\nRead more",

          "description": "Theme park management sim Planet Coaster was all about making roller coasters that would push your park guests to the edge of puking up their overpriced burgers while making sure the excitement levels of your twisting rides remained high. Planet Coaster 2 wants to do that again, but this time adds water parks into the mix, with slides to design, pools to plop down, and raft rides that you can click together to form ambitiously speedy spirals. You can feel some creative pride when you look down on the watery wonderland you've made with these tools. But you may also wonder if it was worth the effort. As a newcomer to Planet management games, I've found this slippy sequel fiddly, cumbersome, and poorly explained.\nRead more",

He’s got ill designs on the world. Your Dad tried to stop him, and he died. He fell into a volcano. We absolutely can’t be having that.\nThis is, more than anything else, a game about Going On An Adventure. Well walked ground, of course, but it’s rare to see it embarked upon with such barefaced delight, or such a wholehearted commitment to going the distance. It is a very big and a very simple RPG that is as wide as an ocean and as deep as a pond; a game to curl up with and play lazily and—with some sour caveats—enjoyably, for an entire winter.\nRead more",

Tequila Works had their funding from Tencent pulled at some point, according to Eurogamer Spain, leaving the company without an important flow of cash.

Young’uns these days just don’t appreciate how revolutionary it was to be able to hit a cop with a thing after he’d already fallen over. Suffice it to say I’ve got good memories of the open world series’ nascent forays into 3D, though never enough to tempt me into revisiting them, especially given the poor reception to Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition. I can sympathise. I’m annoyed just having to type a colon and a dash in the same game name.\nIf you’re in a similarly non-fussed position (I will never not be annoyed that ‘nonplussed’ doesn’t mean what it sounds like it should mean) I can’t imagine a lighting update that’s been available on the mobile versions for a while is enough to tempt you back. But what is a reporter's job if not pathetically treading water between chunklets of Grand Theft Auto news, upon the publishing of which Graham presses the button to release the nutritious pellets on which we all wholly subsist?

Created by a trio of developers including Hidden Folks designer Adriaan de Jongh, it's a world of spacey, sun-carved mountains, forests and monoliths.

There has never been a better time than right this second – averaged out, and despite repeated attempts to the contrary, humanity has never been healthier, freer, or more enlightened by knowledge. It’s true of games too. For every by-committee platter of passionless map markers, there are thousands of more personal, more creative, more interesting works, all adding to the decades' worth of great stuff we can still play today.\nWhat isn’t bollocks is the emotional pull that nostalgia, for all its lack of cold, hard reason, still manages to wield inside our warm, squishy brains. Hence, the centrepiece of Apex Legends’ Season 23 update is a mode that recreates the battle royale FPS as it was back in 2019, defaulting back to the original map and weapon arsenal while cutting the 26-strong legend roster to the earliest ten. It’s a Fortnite-style rolling back of the clock, and a passably enjoyable one, but also a reminder that the good old days weren’t always that good.\nRead more",

All this, plus various daft psychological war gambits of my own devising.

What’s interesting about this one is that vlog mainstay director Rich Alridge has brought along some new faces: battle designer Josh King and audio director Chris Goldsmith. And, yes, so no-one can accuse me of burying the lede: that audio design involved the enthusiastic, deeply disgusting slurping of porridge and yoghurt, and the jangling of real bones.

Nic clued me in on this reddit thread earlier, which cites unnamed Chinese players who've allegedly data-mined the beta's monster models, and learned that they are extremely large, encompassing hundreds of thousands of polygons.\nIf every monster in Monster Hunter Wilds were that fancy all of the time, your computer would become a volcano. As such, the game resorts to loading-on-demand systems to ensure that you only see those gorgeous details when the monsters are close by and, as the case may be, angrily sitting on you. When they're further afield, the flourishes fall away to free up memory and processing power. The popular Redditor explanation for the presence of monsters that look like Henry Moore sculpture is basically that the LOD systems are being forgetful, and neglecting to load the additional polygons at proximity.\n  \nRead more",

This latest campaign in Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 reminds me more of the forgettable Netflix shootfests that thumbnail their way across your TV screen as you try to find some gritty nothing to aid you in zoning out of life. Still, there is an anecdotal contingent of casual sofa sitters for whom Call Of Duty is the game. A balls-to-the-wall shooter to return to every winter and rinse through in a weekend. Ed has already gestured at its multiplayer, announcing: \"yup, it's COD\", like a deeply tired Captain Birdseye inspecting the day's catch, wondering when his life will change. But never mind that.

          "description": "Minor spoilers for the first few hours of Veilguard and heavy spoilers for Baldur’s Gate 3\nFor all the things I ended up enjoying about Dragon Age: The Veilguard, it isn’t much of an RPG. What little roleplaying it does offer revolves around what flavour of supportive hero you prefer, and you can count the number of impactful dialogue decisions on a three-fingered hand. This might sound utterly damning in the wake of Baldur's Gate 3’s incredible reactivity, and if I approached games as some sort of tedious comparative intellectual exercise rather than just, y’know, seeing how I felt about them, then I suppose it would be. Weirdly, though, the recent memory of Baldur’s Gate 3 didn’t diminish my time with Veilguard at all. It was actually the opposite: it freed Dragon Age from having to carry the torch for a certain period in Bioware’s history, and let me enjoy Veilguard for what it was.\nRead more",

          "description": "Twitch have introduced a new \"Politics and Sensitive Social Issues\" label for streams that \"focus\" on topics like \"elections, civic integrity, and war or military conflict\". As with the streaming giant's existing labels for M-rated material, sexual themes or depictions of gambling, the idea is that viewers can filter out such streams in advance by altering their settings.\nAdvertisers, similarly, can \"make better choices about the content they want to advertise next to\" - in other words, pull their ads from a whole swathe of material if they don't want to be associated with anything controversial. Twitch's hope is that \"the labels will allow advertisers to have more context to inform which types of streams they show their ads alongside, which we expect to increase brands’ confidence in running ads on Twitch, and could bring new advertisers to our service.\"\n  \nRead more",

          "description": "The mystery surrounding Deadlock, Valve’s work-in-progress MOBA shooter, has largely evaporated. Its freely extendable invite system is about as effective at controlling player headcount as a disinterested football steward, meaning pretty much anyone with a clued-in Steam friend can get in and start poking around its secrets. And yet, being a lane-pushing wizard fighter in the Dota 2 vein, it’s already a vast tangle of interplaying abilities, items, strats, and often unspoken rules, of the kind that even experienced gankists will take hundreds of hours to learn. It’s been too much for poor Brendy, at any rate.\nStill, Brendy is but one man. What if we had but four men, working in tandem to crush lanes and flatten Patrons just as Gabe intended? To find out if Deadlock is indeed more comprehensible as a team sport, Graham, Ed, Ollie, and James joined forces, promptly getting fucked up yet emerging from the warlock hospital with a deeper understanding of its workings. Or, at least, if anyone would keep playing.\nRead more",

See, you need to keep your headquarters stocked with water, as it gets steadily used by your settlement's inhabitants. The catch being that this water diminishes even while you're not playing the game. If it runs out completely, then everything you've collected gets wiped. The developers have listened to complaints about this most Farmville of mechanics, and they've answered in an interesting way. Water thieves!

It's no doubt built a compelling universe filled with brain-sucking aliens that masquerade as humans, and it attempts plenty else besides: bouncing between bodies as you stealth around dingy apartment blocks, fighting with blood katanas, and gorging on pools of red plasma to refuel skills, many of which require more body-flitting.

Cultural osmosis has once again allowed me to form an uneducated take, however, and I’m getting the sense there’s been some mixed reactions re: bonk quality.

          "description": "Fans of One-Punch Man have been eagerly waiting for the next installation of its anime adaptation. While the third season of the anime is yet to receive an official release date, fans can indulge in ONE's creativity through Bug Ego. It's ONE's latest manga, and it's officially coming to Shonen Jump.\n\n\nHowever, ONE is not working on the manga alone. While ONE handles the narrative, the artwork is brought to life by Kiyoto Shitara, the creator of Shinobuna! Chiyo-chan. Shonen Jump announced the series' arrival on X (formerly Twitter).\n\n\n\n\nBug Ego first had its magazine debut in Weekly Young Jump in April 2023 before transitioning to a monthly serialization in Ultra Jump in October. Both VIZ Media's Shonen Jump app and MANGA Plus are publishing the manga digitally, and four chapters are already available to read.\n\n\nMANGA Plus described the story:\n\n\n\"Kindhearted high school transfer student Hitsujiya offers to help his lonely classmate Kokudo with a few social techniques and life hacks. However, Kokudo seems to know some true hacks that can alter the very fabric of reality. But is it real? What if there’s a 1% chance that it is real? Would you try these hacks?\"\n\n\nImage via Bandai Namco\n\n\nAbout ONE\n\n\nONE is a celebrated webcomic artist best known for creating One-Punch Man. Interestingly, the version of One-Punch Man published by VIZ Media's Shonen Jump isn’t the original webcomic. Instead, it’s a polished rendition illustrated by Yusuke Murata, the artist behind Eyeshield 21. This collaboration has led to immense success, including two seasons of anime adaptations, with a third currently in production.\n\n\nONE's legacy doesn't end there. ONE is also the brilliant mind behind Mob Psycho 100, which is another critically-acclaimed series. It has received a three-season anime adaptation and even a live-action series.\n\nThe post One-Punch Man’s ONE’s new manga debuts in Shonen Jump appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you are eagerly waiting for STALKER 2 Heart of Chernobyl's release on November 20, you can now have more clarity about when you'll be able to play the game.\n\n\nAfter all, different developers follow different launch schedules, and that can also differ with the platform in question. Usually, some games tend to have separate schedules for PC and consoles. For STALKER 2 Heart of Chernobyl, there won't be any such case. The game is going to be available on all applicable platforms at the same time.\n\n\nSTALKER 2 Heart of Chernobyl release timings\n\n\nHere are the release timings of STALKER 2 Heart of Chernobyl in different regions of the world. Note that the release date in some regions will be November 21 (mentioned by a * besides the applicable timings).\n\n\n\nAuckland: 5 a.m. NZDT*\n\n\nSydney: 3 a.m. AEDT*\n\n\nTokyo: 1 a.m. JST*\n\n\nBeijing: 12 a.m. CST*\n\n\nNew Delhi: 9:30 p.m. IST\n\n\nKyiv: 6 p.m. EET\n\n\nLondon: 4 p.m. GMT\n\n\nPrague: 5 p.m. CET\n\n\nNew York: 11 a.m. EST\n\n\nSeattle: 8 a.m. PST\n\n\nSao Paulo: 1 p.m. BRT\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayers located in any region not mentioned here can automatically find the applicable timings for their region by determining the time difference between their clock and any that are mentioned here.\n\n\nDo note that while STALKER 2 Heart of Chernobyl is available in different editions, there's no early access. In simpler words, getting a Premium version won't allow you to play earlier than the rest. It will get you some excellent in-game benefits, however, which will be incredibly beneficial for your in-game journey.\n\n\nAdditionally, there won't be any New Zealand method as well, which often allows you to play a game earlier than its release in a specific region. That method works with games that are released at midnight in a given region. That privilege won't be there for Xbox users this time around, so they're in the same boat as PC users.\n\nThe post STALKER 2 Heart of Chernobyl release time across all regions revealed appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "There are always a few issues present in Call of Duty Black Ops 6, and the Dragon's Breath attachment seems to be having certain problems with the players.\n\n\nThe attachment, meant to be used with the Marine SP shotgun, has an evident bug that makes it really confusing for players to unlock it in the first place. In fact, the unlock condition seen on the item is completely wrong, but you'll be able to access it once you have made fair progression into Season 1 content.\n\n\nHow to get Dragon's Breath in Black Ops 6\n\n\nThe main bug associated with this attachment is related to its unlock condition, which can sometimes show up as \"Unlock at None Level 1\". You won't need to bother with this, as the attachment can be unlocked from page 7 of the battle pass. That's how the Dragon's Breath is supposed to be unlocked in the first place.\n\n\nIt's unclear when the bug, which looks like a visual one as of now, will be fixed. It's certainly not something that the players themselves can change, and Treyarch is planning an update to fix the use of legacy XP tokens. That update could also potentially fix this confusion and make it easier for everyone who has yet to get their hands on the unique attachment.\n\n\n\n\nIncidentally, there were at least a couple of reported instances where players reported that the attachment apparently doesn't do anything in Zombies. This might be due to a second bug, which could be triggered in some cases, or it might be due to incorrect use.\n\n\nIn my case, the \"Unlock at None Level 1\" bug was there from the start but became redundant upon reaching the required page on the battle pass. The attachment seems to be tailor-made for the Zombies mode and does a lot of damage. In my brief experience, it's best not to be used in the multiplayer mode, where it doesn't do much.\n\nThe post How to fix the Dragon’s Breath bug in Black Ops 6 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Enshrouded is a survival action RPG developed by Keen Games. As the genre suggests, you have to basically do all the necessary activities to survive in the game. One of the most important elements in this game is armor, which you can build with Dried Fur. \n\n\nHowever, finding this item might be a bit of a hassle, so to help you get that, here is a comprehensive guide on how to get the Dried Fur in Enshrouded.\n\n\nHow to get Dried Fur in Enshrouded\n\n\nImage via Enshrouded\n\n\nBasically, Dried Fur is a material that is used in making items like Fur Rug or some sets like Explorer Set and Adventurer Set. Despite being a material, you also need some materials to craft Dried Fur. Here are the required items needed to craft it:\n\n\n\nDrying Rack\n\n\nAnimal Fur\n\n\nSalt\n\n\n\nFirst things first, you have to craft Drying Rack which will require you to have 10 Wood Logs and 6 Strings. You can also craft Drying Rack by talking to the Hunter. You can obtain Wood Logs by chopping down the trees and Strings by crafting them via Plant Fibers.\n\n\nSecondly, you need one Animal Fur and three Salts. To get the Animal Fur, you simply have to kill animals and loot them to get their fur. Remember that not all animals will provide you with the Animal Fur. But compared to Salt, it is very much getable. \n\n\nSalt is basically a mineable resource that you can use not only to craft Dried Fur but also to add seasoning to the Farmer’s recipe. To get that item, simply wander off in the Enshrouded Valleys. The best salt mine that you can go for is in the north-east direction from the first base location. Once you have found both the items, you can use these items to craft the Dried Fur. \n\nThe post How to get Dried Fur in Enshrouded appeared first on Destructoid.",

Each personality type has different strengths and weaknesses, so leaving it down to chance can cause a lot of issues further down the line. \n\n\nSome personality types are definitely preferable to others in DQ3, with the Vamp personality giving the most evenly balanced stats. However, the Vamp personality type is restricted to female Heroes. \n\n\nOn the plus side, it is possible to fix your stats using Stat Seeds that are collected as you play, so even if you get a personality type that doesn’t suit your preferred gameplay style, it’s not the end of the world. And if you’re truly unhappy with your given personality, you can also change it using items or accessories. \n\n\nAll personality t…",

          "description": "Castle Master, the haunting conclusion to the Freescape engine saga, is now ready for public testing!\nPrepare yourself for a perilous adventure as you lower the drawbridge to enter the Castle Master’s domain. Released in 1990 by Incentive Software, Castle Master became popular for its technical innovation and challenging gameplay. The game inspired countless 3D adventure titles, and the Freescape engine itself marked a technological milestone, enabling groundbreaking object interaction and spatial puzzles.\nNotably, Castle Master was one of the first games to let you choose to play as either a prince or a princess, offering a different experience depending on your choice.\nYour mission: rescue your twin, imprisoned within the eerie depths of Castle Eternity by the evil Magister. This sprawling, foreboding castle is filled with traps, monsters, and puzzles blocking your path. Gather items, unlock doors, and solve complex riddles as you navigate the labyrinthine halls and confront the dark forces within.\nThis modern reimplementation showcases enhanced graphics using OpenGL, with initial support for the DOS and ZX Spectrum releases. If you’re eager to embark on this dark journey, a playable demo is available to test your tenacity.\nTo participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.\nWill you brave the creepy corridors of Castle Eternity and free your sibling, or will you fall victim to the Magister’s curse and join his army of enslaved spirits? The adventure awaits!\n>",

The engine supports 14 games, five of which we are announcing support for. Most of these games were released in Russian; however, there were Lithuanian, Czech, and Polish releases. The support is announced for:\nWait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare, (Russian: Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца, Lithuanian: Na, palauk!

Also, we are looking for the Lithuanian version of Little Longnose and Polish releases of Little Mice games and Wait for it! game. If you happen to have a copy, please contact sev.\nWe continue the active development so that support for other games will follow shortly.

          "description": "We are excited to announce that Rise of the Dragon  is now ready for public testing. This is the first of a small number of games built using the DGDS (Dynamix Game Development System) engine.\nThe Dynamix name may be familiar – bought by Sierra in 1990, the Dynamix brand continued and became well known for action and puzzle games like The Incredible Machine, A10 Tank Killer, and Red Baron.  They also made a few adventures using the custom DGDS engine.\nRise of the Dragon is set in Los Angeles in a dark version of the future, circa 2053.  You play as Blade Hunter, a private investigator and retired police officer.  After a designer drug kills the mayor's rebellious daughter, Chandra, Hunter is hired to find the people responsible for releasing the drug on the streets. What Blade ultimately finds is much more than he expected.  Rise of the Dragon combines classic point-and-click adventure style with platforming arcade sequences, giving a unique gameplay combination.\nYou’ll need the latest daily build of ScummVM and files from the DOS version of the game, which you can buy at GOG (check our wiki for the required data files).  Please file any issues you notice on our bug tracker.\n>",

          "description": "Mylně jsem se domníval, že jdu na film o problematice eutanázie. Ale místo toho Toltékové, astrální cestování, život po životě, reinkarnace a Jaroslav Dušek.
