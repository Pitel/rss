This afternoon, Ubisoft's dedicated showcase, a separate 15-minute stream from Nintendo's Direct Mini, has revealed various elements of the upcoming game, including new gameplay details (no grids!), characters (Bowser, Rabbit Rosalina, and the ever-mysterious green and purple Rabbid, Edge), and more information on the evil force trying to absorb the galaxy's energy, including that of the titular Sparks.\n\nWatch: Mario + Rabbids Sparks Of Hope Showcase - Live!\n\nTough as it might be to believe, it's been nearly five years since Ubisoft and Nintendo released a crossover that seemed unlikely and — dare we say it — unnatural at the time. Multiverse crossovers are ten-a-penny these days, but rumours that Mario's Mushroom Kingdom crew would be collaborating with Ubisoft's love-'em-or-hate-'em Rabbids (anarchic bunnies which spawned from the Rayman series into a pre-Minions world) seemed crazy enough, but coming together in an XCOM-style turn-based strategy game that outfitted the cast with blasters? Surely not.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "I loved Monster Hunter: Rise when I first played it on Switch last year, but I’ll admit that I sort of sleep-walked through its entirety, dreamily kicking the tails off a couple of raptors before making them into a fashionable pair of hot pants. This wasn’t a bad thing, mind. Far from it. I found Rise to be a substantially better-paced MonHunt entry compared to its predecessors, the series’ steep barrier to entry readjusted to a gentle incline that was more palatable for newcomers like me. Monster Hunter’s particular flavour of RPG design has always felt like trying to find a fork in a friend’s kitchen while they’re in another room. Nothing is where you expect it to be and there are a lot of things here you just don’t understand. Admittedly Rise wasn’t much better, stuffed as it was with endless text-based tutorials, but at the very least it pointed out the right drawer this time around. \r\n\n \nRead more",

It's also a sort of sequel to Dungeon Of The Endless, a turn-based game from 2014 that laid a lot of the groundwork for Endless Dungeon's core loop of dungeon runs and wave survival. I got to sample one of its earliest levels with three different heroes in a recent hour long preview session, but came away with mixed feelings. If you can get a foothold in a run it's fantastic, but getting that foothold can be frustrating in its current state.\nRead more",

Whenever it starts, I tend to drop whatever I'm doing - work, dishes, significant other - and I'll be out frolicking in the downpour before they've hit the floor.\nBecause I love rain so much, I hold games to an almost unfair standard when it comes to the simulation of precipitation. How in the world can a videogame come close to emulating that wonderful, transcendental feeling of being outside in the middle of a thunderstorm? The answer is, it can't. Games have to rely on other things, like textures, sounds, and clever little animations to really sell the idea of being out amongst the H₂s and the Os.\nThe time has come, fellow pluviophiles. It's time to grade the very best rain that PC gaming has to offer. Below you'll find our eight worthy contenders. Each has been chosen for their spectacular rendition of one of nature's greatest phenomena. Each one shall be marked according to my patented and cutting-edge WIPERS grading system for digital rain.

The Enhanced Edition is out today and I've been flicking back and forth between the two versions, tutting. The Enhanced Edition still looks like a 25-year-old game, only now it looks 25 years old, blurry, and unlike itself.\nRead more",

          "description": "I still don't know whether to describe The Heroic Legend Of Eagarlnia as \"complicated\" or \"simple\". Before starting a game, it gives an impression of being a complex grand strategy that's something like a fantasy Total War with a D&D alignment system and a distinctly East Asian focus on characters and dialogue.\nIt's far simpler than that. There was a period of disappointment, even, when it seemed like there wasn't much to it at all. That's partly because it's easy to play it too passively, or get stuck in attritional stand offs, and partly because of the need for a bit too much repetition. But over time its subtler details become more apparent, and your choices start to feel more multifaceted.\nAnd yet, it remains at heart the same throughout. On your first ten turns you're doing the same actions as in your 200th, and its battles in particular are largely hands off. So maybe it's complicated, but simple to actually play? Hmm.\nRead more",

Oxenfree was good, and Oxenfree II looks to be doing those same things that made Oxenfree good. A 2D, side-on supernatural thriller with radios. Good thing remains good! In a world where sequels to beloved media seem to only get progressively worse, I'll happily take it (especially since this one is a Netflix-published project now). And although it's directly related to the first game, the characters and happenings in Oxenfree II are distinct enough that it's going to be accessible if you're new to the series. And even if you did play the first game, it's possible that Oxenfree II will be more thrilling and unsettling to you now, five years later.\nRead more",

Short version: pretty well! It can make do with older and lower-end hardware at 1080p, and scales nicely all the way up to 4K and ultrawide resolutions, taking full advantage of the best graphics cards or the best gaming monitors with high refresh rates. If your rig is only just scraping past the system requirements, there are also some chunky performance improvements available via the right graphics settings tweaks. \r\n\n \nRead more",

This would involve, as they always do, a bunch of benchmark tests: repeatable runs through a specific area or sequence that would give an accurate indication of how different settings and hardware affect performance. In most games these are either quick and easy or time-consuming and easy, but not The Cycle: Frontier. Oh no.\r\n\n\r\nSee, without a dedicated benchmarking tool, running these kinds of tests requires a certain controllable environment, where variables are known and parameters can be reset in a click. This is not the case for The Cycle: Frontier, whose environment is usually trying to fucking kill you, particularly though the unavoidable presence of other players. I’ve never sat down to record some average FPS values only to spend half my time cowering behind a tree, fearful of being shot, robbed and – worst of all – forced to start work over again.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Wacky battle royale Fall Guys is going free to play from today, so you no longer have any excuses not to try it other than an inability to decide on an outfit for your bean to wear. I’m partial to the giant foam hand costume myself. However, Fall Guys has also been removed from sale on Steam so it can become an Epic Games Store exclusive. Don’t worry if you already own the game on Steam though, because you’ll still have access through Valve’s launcher. Here’s some bouncy Free For All update gameplay in the trailer below.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Last week Intel published a “quick start guide” for their upcoming Arc A-series graphics cards, including a “Supported Hardware Configurations” section that only specifically namechecked their own 10th, 11th and 12th Gen Core CPUs. Cue a heady mix of confusion and perturbation – surely Intel weren’t suggesting that Arc GPUs would only function when paired with an Intel CPU, and a relatively new one at that?\r\n\n\r\nNo, they weren’t, though the guide’s vague wording isn’t doing it – and worse, potential Arc users – any favours. Parts of the guide appear to conflate support for Resizable BAR with support for the Arc A-series in general, which further muddies things as Resizable BAR works on AMD Ryzen chips as well as those three Core CPU generations. I asked Intel directly for clarification and essentially, Arc GPUs won’t have such super specific CPU requirements just to run - though they’ll apparently perform better in systems that do support Resizable BAR.\r\n\n \nRead more",

There were some demos I was meant to play for, like, actual work, and then I ran into a puzzle wall or a bug or something so I just fired up Necrosmith again.\nNecrosmith is a 2D necromance 'em up that is also sort of a tower defence game. In the middle of the map is your evil lair, the Hall Of Bones, a sort of legally distinct Sauron's tower that gets more flying buttresses the more you upgrade it. If enemies (which can be packs of wolves or flying bugs or all manner of things) do enough damage to destroy it, you lose - so that's your defense bit. For the towers bit, you have to imagine that the towers can move on their own, and also that they're shambling undead monsters made from a jigsaw of different limbs you find, like an army of very unhygenic Mr Potato Heads.\nRead more",

That's partially why it's getting a whole GoldenEye 64 documentary!\nDirected by documentarian Drew Roller, it'll bring us through the journey of the game \"developer in a farmhouse in Warwickshire by a small ragtag team of university graduates, most of whom had never worked on a game before.\" Based on the trailer, the doc will take a look at how GoldenEye 64 (among several other games), changed the way shooters were perceived on consoles. There's interviews with past developers afoot, as well as tons of classic late '90s footage sprinkled in to take some of us back: or give younger folks a frame of reference for the \"Xtreme/Attitude\" period of the industry.\nIf you're interested, you can find the site for the production team here, which is where it'll debut in digital format on June 27. Although the digital platforms differ by region, it's currently being sold on iTunes [Apple TV] for roughly $9.99 USD, and the film clocks in at one hour and 39 minutes.\nIt's starting to get to the point where a lot of these retro games are \"ancient history,\" and can be looked at in the same way that old relics of the past (like Pong) were just 20 years ago. I've come to accept it!\n[Update: The documentary is out now. The digital platform options now include Prime Video, Sky, and Google Play in addition to Apple TV.]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJ4JUWvIxAI\nThe post There’s a GoldenEye 64 documentary coming out really soon (Update) appeared first on Destructoid.",

Among other options, it's possible to set your Switch icon as the revolting (and amusingly censored) Dubious Food.\nLink, Zelda, Urbosa, Revali, Tera, and a riled-up Bokoblin — the gang's all here. If you want to be prim and proper, the choice is yours. My eyes immediately darted elsewhere.\n[caption id=\"attachment_332306\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1920\"] Zelda: Breath of the Wild player icons are up for grabs until July 4 at 5:59 p.m. Pacific.[/caption]\nIf you're feeling bold, you'll drop 10 points on the Dubious Food and swap it in as your (permanent?) new Nintendo Switch player icon. Well, at least until the joke wears thin.\nYou can find the current selection from your Switch home screen — click on the red Switch Online icon, then scroll down to Missions & Rewards to see what's available.\nThis whole \"weekly avatars\" scheme is still pretty fresh, with tons of games and imagery to pull from, so I think it's amusing that Nintendo is willing to include some off-kilter imagery this early into the proceedings. If anything, the trick is just getting people to pay attention — I would've totally missed the Dubious Food if not for a Reddit shout-out.\nAfter appearing in Breath of the Wild and Age of Calamity, I'll be bummed if this so-called food doesn't return for the sequel. I hope it's even more of a wildcard next time around.\nThe post Zelda: Breath of the Wild’s Dubious Food is now a Switch player icon appeared first on Destructoid.",

Feeling lonely in his new home, he dives into his imagination as the superhero Captain Velvet Meteor.\nAlong the way, he imagines a roster of his favorite Jump+ characters filling his adventures.

Shooters, platformers, narrative adventures, fighting games — iconic genres that have almost forty years of precedence to make them what they are today. Various developers and studios have given us some truly amazing entries in all of these genres and many more, but sometimes, I find myself wondering if there's anything new out there that will shake up the industry. Of course, this is always a silly thought, because people are endlessly creative, especially when it comes to game design.

Another sequel is long overdue, and thankfully the developers behind the project, Terrible Toybox, just released a new trailer to satiate us as we wait for the game to drop later this year. The trailer was also posted by Monkey Island's beloved designer and creator Ron Gilbert, who shared the news with the exact type of humor we'd expect from him.\nThe new trailer shows off Return to Monkey Island's revamped art style, which captures the quirkiness of the characters and world perfectly. Although we didn't get to see all that much of it, the gameplay itself looks like the classic Monkey Island experience we know and love. Story-wise, our plucky protagonist Guybrush Threepwood promises we're in for an adventure with \"ships, fights, love, treasure, betrayal, and root beer.\" As an avid lover of all things pirate-related myself, I don't think there's much more I could really ask for.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3mxq44HhnU\nI can be pretty hesitant about sequels this far out from the originals, especially when a series' legacy is on the line, but I have to say that I've been blown away by everything I've seen of Return to Monkey Island so far. It also says a lot that they have some of the original creators involved. At this point, I'm optimistic that the game will bring a thrilling adventure from a classic series to a brand new audience.\nReturn to Monkey Island takes to the high seas sometime in 2022 for PC and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Return to Monkey Island gets a swashbuckling new trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

But it seems that we all had a lot of growing up to do, as Microids has channeled that bemusement into sadistic determination.\nFollowing up the fall 2021 release of platform adventure The Smurfs: Mission Vileaf, the French publisher has now moved on to that second video game genre detailed in the Big Book of IP Licensing: Kart Racing. Smurfs Kart will see the little blue buggers taking to the rural raceway in a selection of rickety-looking wooden karts, loaded for bear with special items and unique abilities.\nPlayers can choose from The Main One, The One With The Chef's Hat, The Old One, Smurfette, or The Others.

Customers should think fast, however, as they only have three days to confirm and pay for their chosen model, which will lock in their order and see their lil' black box begin the journey to their front door. Those still waiting on their email can check the status of their order at the Steam Deck store.\nValve's Steam Deck has proven to be yet another victim of electronic component shortages. Ever since the global COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted international production and shipment industries, manufacturers have struggled to meet their initial targets for hardware rollout. The delays that currently affect the Steam Deck platform have also affected the production and distribution of consoles such as Sony's PS5, Xbox's Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch, as well as graphics cards for PCs and tech markets outside of the gaming sphere.\nThe Steam Deck officially launched in March 2022, and currently supports well over 2000 titles.\nhttps://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1541459263444332544?s=20&t=WKqS4hxl2_9h8NdDWxkkag\nThe post Valve looking to double Steam Deck production and distribution appeared first on Destructoid.",

The huge fan-made expansion is set to arrive next year, in 2023.\nThe trailer, which premiered over the weekend, showcases the sights and sounds of London in the post-nuclear apocalypse of Fallout. Though there's ruins and destruction abound, you can still make out plenty of landmarks and vistas you'd expect to see.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzGG-eImQ_Q\nFallout London is billed as a continuation of base Fallout 4. The setting is a pretty drastic jump as Fallout has never really ventured outside the U.S. for its locales. The team says tackling the London setting allows them to explore cultures that have not homogenized with the American wasteland, as well as explore the effects of the Resource Wars on pre-war Britain.\nA new wasteland\nWe've seen some gameplay of this massive mod before, but it looks like the dev team has at least a decent inkling of when Fallout London will see the light of day. And even though Fallout and other Bethesda RPGs have a history of massive mods, this one has some particularly intriguing elements.\nThe boat and canals look really interesting. The obvious London theming feels like a good, healthy departure and exciting environment to explore. And at one point, at the very end of the trailer, I swear I saw a battle elephant. An honest-to-goodness, Lord of the Rings-style war elephant. Seems like London gets wild in the nuclear future.\nSince it seems like it will be a very, very long time before Bethesda ever circles back around to the Fallout franchise, Fallout London seems like a decent hope for those looking for a fresh take. The massive Fallout 4 mod is planned to arrive sometime in 2023.\nThe post Fallout London, a fan-made DLC-sized mod for Fallout 4, will launch in 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Square Enix's Harvestella is the company's take on the farming life sim RPG, arriving November 4 for PC (via Steam) and Nintendo Switch.\nShown today during the Nintendo Direct Mini: Partner Showcase, Harvestella is a new RPG from Square Enix that mixes farming, socializing, and RPG action into one big pot.\nIt immediately gives off some Rune Factory vibes, as it seems to have a similar mix of combat and farming. But it's also got some interesting twists on the formula.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Yd3tzhN99E\nWhile there are four seasons—spring, summer, fall, and winter—there's also a season of death called Quietus. During this time, crops wither and lethal dust keeps the denizens of the world indoors.\nPlanning harvests will have to accommodate for this bizarre mystery, and it looks like a major drive will be figuring out why the Quietus is happening.\nA bountiful harvest\nOf course, there's both crop harvesting and livestock raising. Harvestella has many of the familiar farming trappings. It also has combat and an overworld to explore, though, which is where the Rune Factory comparison starts to feel more apt.\nThe Square Enix blog dives into more detail, noting a job system that will let the player character specialize in certain combat forms. Be a Fighter and dive right into the fray. Or play a Mage, and launch magic from afar. The overworld has new characters to meet, dungeons to explore, and even a submarine.\n\nMore and more companies have been trying their hand at a farming life sim. (A Disney-themed one was even in this showcase, too.) What Square Enix has with Harvestella seems pretty darn interesting. A game with all the expected features like farming, fighting, and socializing plus some RPG goodness in the mysteries of the world?

          "description": "Rise of the Robots\nA stone-cold classic of dystopian gaming is headed to Switch this year — as revealed during this morning's Nintendo Direct, Square Enix's apocalyptic and dramatic action adventure NieR: Automata will bring its wistful storytelling and dark, indelible worlds to the Switch platform this fall.\nNieR: Automata: The End of YorHa Edition will see the award-winning 2017 release faithfully recreated for the Switch platform, bundled alongside all previously released content including DLC expansions, additional modes, and a fully-stocked wardrobe of snazzy duds for automated heroes 2B, 9S, and, A2. In addition, the Switch port will feature its own range of console exclusive skins, so you can ensure 2B is rocking all of her fineries as she picks her way through our miserable, dilapidated planet.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGAmLykQsck\nOriginally developed by PlatinumGames, Nier: Automata sees an Earth lying in devastation, with mankind locked in a brutal proxy war against a seemingly insurmountable army of alien-created machines. In response, humanity builds its own automated protection in the form of sentient androids, who do battle with the machines in a never-ending war of attrition for control of the planet. NieR: Automata tells the story of three such androids and their dramatic, emotive, and often heart-breaking existence as pawns in a galactic battle for world domination.\nNieR: Automata: End of YorHa Edition launches October 6 on Nintendo Switch. Pre-orders for the physical release are now live at the official Square Enix store and include a pretty rad-looking shirt.\nThe post NieR: Automata is coming to Nintendo Switch this fall appeared first on Destructoid.",

Even better news, the irreverent, brain-teasing title will land on the eShop today!\nhttps://youtu.be/wMQASUA_1Do\nPortal Companion Collection compiles 2007 hit Portal along with its 2011 follow-up — the two classics are freshly repackaged for their release on Nintendo's hybrid console. Return to the terrifying Aperture Science Enrichment Center and utilize the power of physics, gravity, and portals to guide our hero out of her cell, out of the system, and out of the hazardous clutches of the scarily sentient overseer, GLaDOS.\nCombining dark humor, genuine pathos, and some fantastic lateral thinking shenanigans, the Portal games became instant classics upon release and have only welcomed more disciples into their twisted coven in the ensuing 15 years. Already available on practically every platform under the sun, this new compilation of two of gaming's finest and most beloved puzzlers will allow Switch players to set their heads fizzing and spinning whilst in bed, on a commute, or simply out and about. Just watch your step.\nPortal: Companion Collection launches on the Nintendo eShop today for $19.99.\nThe post Break out the cake: Portal Companion Collection hits Switch today appeared first on Destructoid.",

A \"complete\" edition with everything sort of solves that problem in the modern era.\nNintendo says that there will actually be two volumes (Volume 1, and Volume 2, which are \"each sold separately\") to contain all those games, and that the release is coming in 2023. The Mega Man Battle Network collection on Switch will also sport a gallery \"with over 1000 illustrations,\" and \"over 150 songs from across the series.\" Capcom has confirmed that the re-releases \"feature optional high-resolution filters that allow players to enjoy smoother, less pixelated visuals,\" and \"players can turn the filters off/on at any time if they would prefer to enjoy the original visuals of the Battle Network games.\"\nYou can find Volume 1 on the Nintendo Store here, and Volume 2 here. Of note, Rockman EXE 4.5 Real Operation and Mega Man Battle Network 5: Double Team DS do not seem to be part of this collection.\nMega Man Battle Network Switch Volume 1 game list:\nMega Man Battle Network\nMega Man Battle Network 2\nMega Man Battle Network 3 Blue\nMega Man Battle Network 3 White\nMega Man Battle Network Switch Volume 2 game list:\nMega Man Battle Network 4 Red Sun\nMega Man Battle Network 4 Blue Moon\nMega Man Battle Network 5 Team ProtoMan\nMega Man Battle Network 5 Team Colonel\nMega Man Battle Network 6 Cybeast Gregar\nMega Man Battle Network 6 Cybeast Falzar\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5anP8oC-ePY\nThe post A whopping 10 Mega Man Battle Network games are coming to Switch appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Persona 5 is coming to Switch this year on October 21, 2022\nThe Persona Switch dream is a reality.\nToday during the Nintendo Direct Mini, which was aimed at third-party partner announcements, Nintendo showcased the release of Persona 3 Portable, Persona 4 Golden, and Persona 5 Royal on Switch. The former two are slated as a nebulous \"coming soon\" release, while Persona 5 is fully dated for October 21, 2022.\nThis news directly follows the recent announcement of the trio for the PC, PS5, and Xbox platforms two weeks ago. And really, it's not even something that needed to be leaked, rather than assumed! Nintendo isn't shy about collaborating with Atlus, and given that they aren't exclusive to any one platform, the company likely wants to see the trio out on as many platforms as possible: including one of the best-selling consoles of the modern era.\nIn any case, a Persona Switch announcement is great news. All of these games need to proliferate as far and wide as possible, and all of them have their own unique spins and cast members to differentiate themselves. I like all three of them for very different reasons, though Persona 5 has become the golden goose in recent years, and the favorite in many circles.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgbQIcjzq_4\nThe post Nintendo reveals that Persona 3, 4, 5 are coming to Switch appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's not the full Nintendo Direct that was predicted by some on June 29 — rather, it's a Nintendo Direct Mini on June 28. That's at 9AM ET, actually, and the publisher says it'll be happening here when the time comes.\nAgain, it's important to note that this isn't a first-party Direct, and to set your expectations accordingly. Here is the full descriptive rundown of the Nintendo Direct Mini that we got directly from Nintendo:\n\"Watch on-demand via our YouTube channel starting at 6 a.m. PT / 9 a.m. ET on June 28 for roughly 25 minutes of info on upcoming third-party Nintendo Switch games.\"\n\nSo on paper, we're not getting updates on Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2 or Metroid Prime 4...yet. Or an update on when Advance Wars might come out on Switch for that matter.\n25 minutes is a fairly meaty timeframe, in any case, so we should see at least one big third-party announcement. I assume a lot of you will be doing avid amounts of research as to what a Nintendo Direct Mini actually entails, and we did a lot of the legwork already! You can check this out to get an idea of what a Direct Mini could look like.\nThe company was smart to move this away from the Summer of Gaming/to-E3-or-not-to-E3 week and have it be its own thing. Even if it doesn't include first-party updates, all it takes is one megaton announcement (something exclusive akin to Shin Megami Tensei V) to make waves.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKB3WXRWTCM\nThe post A Nintendo Direct Mini is coming on June 28 appeared first on Destructoid.",

It seems as if the sequel is due in October, thanks to a listing for October 20 on an international arm of Ubisoft's own site. The date was subsequently taken down, but it was discovered by several folks on Twitter (including Wario64) and screencapped/archived.\nIn all likelihood, Ubisoft and Nintendo want to save the Sparks of Hope release announcement for the Nintendo Direct Mini this morning, so we only have roughly an hour and change to go until we get full confirmation. Now, this has happened before. The announcement for the game itself was actually fully leaked by the Nintendo storefront around this time in 2021.\nAs a reminder, Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope was revealed last year, and serves as a sequel to the 2017 original, Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle. Ubisoft promises more open-ended levels to tackle, as well as an enhanced combat system.\nIt feels like we're in a weird little \"post-E3\" era this summer, with all these Nintendo announcements either leaking errantly or on the way. Hopefully we get some good third party confirmations for 2022!

In addition to dropping not one, not two, but three videos fleshing out the game's narrative, characters, and combat, we now know the JRPG launches in October. \nThe Divine Force arrives on October 27, exactly one year after it was first announced. The first trailer showcases the plot with a montage of out-of-context story clips that sets the tone for what's to come in the sci-fi action RPG. \n\n\nThe second video provides a more thorough walkthrough of Star Ocean's characters and combat. Players assume the role of one of two protagonists: Raymond Lawrence, a hot-headed merchant ship captain searching for his lost crew, and Laeticia Aucerius, a princess fighting to save her kingdom from destruction. The story unfolds differently depending on your chosen hero, and a ragtag party of allies accompanies each. The action-focused combat utilizes four party members players can swap between on the fly. You can battle in real-time or pause the action using Stop Mode to allow time to change tactics.  \n\n\nLastly, you watch the entire 8-minute opening cinematic for Raymond's campaign to see how the adventure kicks off for the young captain. \n\n\nTri-Ace promises to share more information in a future Mission Report video. Star Ocean The Divine Force will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

If you aren’t familiar with Fallen Angel, you can get a look at what awaits you in it in the special Switch announcement trailer below: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, there are a lot of hellacious things going on, which makes sense considering you control Lucifer as he attempts to ascend from hell to get revenge on those who banished him from heaven. \n“With no god in place, heaven is up for grabs, and it’s up to Lucifer to reclaim his birthright and battle fearsome archangel…",

          "description": "Yesterday, Spellbreak developer Proletariat released a blog post detailing the future of its spell-based battle royale that launched years ago. In it, the studio revealed that the servers for Spellbreak will shut down in early 2023, effectively ending the run of this battle royale. \nThis shutdown likely had to do with the game’s low player count. Still, there might be more to it than that: Blizzard Entertainment, the studio behind franchises like Overwatch and Warcraft, is acquiring Proletariat and using its force of roughly 100 employees to staff up its World of Warcraft team, according to a new report from GamesBeat. \n“We are putting players at the forefront of everything we do, and we are working hard to both meet and exceed their expectations,” Blizzard president Mike Ybarra told the publication in a statement. “A big part of caring for our teams is making sure we have the resources to produce experiences our communities will love while giving our teams space to explore even more creative opportunities within their projects. Proletariat is a perfect fit for supporting Blizzard’s mission in bringing high-quality content to our players more often.” \nThis news comes just months before the launch of the newest World of Warcraft expansion, Dragonflight, which you can read more about here. As noted by GamesBeat, this acquisition is one of the largest in recent memory for Blizzard. This purchase means that the Proletariat team will be under the Microsoft-Xbox umbrella soon following the completion of Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard.\nAccording to the GamesBeat report, the purpose of this acquisition is to beef up World of Warcraft staff numbers so “that it can hit quality and timing goals for expansions.” Neither of the involved parties has publicly released a price for this transaction.\n[Source: GamesBeat]",

This classic compilation of games stretches beyond the standard game-collection bundles we've seen in the past, with aspirations of serving as a virtual, interactive museum to paint a picture of just how influential and important Atari was, particularly through the nascent years of the video game industry.

          "description": "You’ve probably heard of or played Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, the character-collecting adventure set in a galaxy far, far away. The mobile game launched in 2015 and, in the years that followed, amassed a substantial fanbase that continues to get support from sizeable roster updates. The creators behind Galaxy of Heroes recently formed Azra Games. And the studios’ debut title will appropriately be a collectible and combat RPG called Legions & Legends. \nAzra Games CEO and co-founder Mark Otero excitedly spoke about the announcement of the new game:\n“This will be my ninth collectible and combat RPG, one that builds upon and perfects the genre I’ve spent my entire career developing. I truly believe that we’ve cracked the code for a captivating gameplay experience built around the joys of collecting toys and taking them to battle against each other, just as we used to do when we were kids. At Azra, we’re looking to bring back that excitement of the toy box and playing with friends – remastered for a new generation of players.”\nAzra Games is a blockchain games company. Legions & Legends launches this summer (an exact date wasn’t specified) with the release of the “Genesis Collection” NFTs which generate in-game resources through Ethereum. But what exactly is Legions & Legends? A press release/blog post penned by Otero gives us a brief look into the Legions & Legends’ “uncharted galaxy where magic and technology collide.” \nCivilizations unknown to humankind are at war, and players will be at the forefront of the bloody conflict to claim the galaxy. Three character types can be deployed on the battlefield – Legionnaires, best used in large numbers, Commanders, known for special attacks/buffs, and Behemoths, slow and tanky creatures with devastating power. The aforementioned NFT collection introduces Genesis Explorers, which players can send on Exploration Missions for craftable parts. \nAs Otero put it, “Your journey deep into the Corvus Galaxy awaits.”",

Crystal Dynamics released a pair of videos showcasing her thunder-based abilities, giving fans a look at how she compares to her original male counterpart.\nJane arrives as a free character in all versions of Marvel’s Avengers. The narrative explains that Jane was torn from an alternate reality in which she is the one and only Thor. Odinson renounced Mjolnir following A-Day, and though Jane developed cancer, her transformation into the Goddess of Thunder halted the disease as she battled to protect Inhumans from persecution. One day, a Tachyon Strom caused by AIM opened a portal that dropped Jane into the game’s universe. She joins up with the Avengers to uncover the cause of the rifts and figure out how to return home. \nThe Mighty Thor wields Mjolnir with more precision than Odinson and sports new abilities that highlight her increased finesse. You can watch the War Table video below for a complete breakdown of her skills or watch the video below for a non-commentary gameplay demonstration.\n\n\n\n\nJane’s addition brings the game’s total roster of heroes to 10 on most platforms and 11 on PlayStation, thanks to Spider-Man’s exclusivity.

But the cycle is interrupted due to an abnormal event that creates a “season of death” called the Quietus, which causes crops to wither and threatens all life.\nHarvestella’s gameplay splits time between action-focused dungeon crawling and laid-back farm management. Players globetrot to areas representing the four seasons to battle monsters and explore dungeons. You can even hop in a submarine to traverse the oceans. Combat involves executing team maneuvers with party members, and each character can be outfitted with different jobs that grant unique characteristics, skills, and combat styles. \n\n\nWhen you’re not fighting for the world’s survival, you’ll return to your village to tend to your farm. Raising crops and livestock lets you harvest ingredients for crafting. When the work is done, socializing with townsfolk is another key diversion. Along the way, you’ll meet a cast of characters such as a time traveler from the future, and completing tasks for them grants rewards and improves your bonds with them. \nHarvestella looks intriguing and we can’t wait to see more of it. It’s also not terribly far away, launching November 4 for Switch and PC via Steam.",

Apparently, he's unleashing his full potential and hacking advanced superhero bases to level up his vigilanteism.\n\n\nIn a new character trailer, Robin shows off how he disposes of Gotham's thugs. His standard melee combat is centered around quick attacks and the use of his quarterstaff for leverage and mid-range beatdowns. Robin also has a stealthy element, enabling active camouflage to mask his presence and sneak up on unsuspecting suspects. The most surprising reveal in the trailer is that the Boy Wonder has tapped into the Justice League satellite to enable short-range teleportation to zip around Gotham to get the drop on enemies or make impossible leaps a reality. He's also using holograms to deploy decoys to deceive dummies in combat.\nGotham Knights is looking great after the last couple of trailers, and I'm looking forward to seeing this team take on the Court of Owls when it releases on October 25.",

This throwback to the 1999 PlayStation 1 title features revamped graphics and more, and is scheduled to release this August.\n\n\nPac-Man World puts you in the shoes of Pac-Man as he platforms through six worlds on Ghost Island to rescue his friends. Each world consists of five levels, with each world's final level featuring a boss battle. In the game, Pac-Man can use a variety of skills, including the ability to Rev Roll, Butt Bounce, and turn into Giant Pac-Man. When the original title was first released on PS1, Game Informer liked the title, scoring it an 8 out of 10 in 1999.\nThis is the second remake the original 1999 title has received, the first of which was in 2004 for the Game Boy Advance. The game also appeared on PlayStation Network beginning in 2013 under the PSOne Classics branding. However, the original PS1 version is not among the classic titles currently included in the PlayStation Plus Premium tier's classic catalog.\nPac-Man World: Re-Pac launches on August 26 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",

Sure enough, there was, as Mega Man Legacy Collection 2, Mega Man X Legacy Collection, Mega Man X Legacy Collection 2, and Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection followed in subsequent years. However, one pain point among the fan base is the lack of a modern way to enjoy the myriad Mega Man Battle Network titles.\n\n\nToday, Capcom finally gave that segment of the fan base what it's been clamoring for with the Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection. Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection gathers 10 games from the series, along with over 1,000 illustrations and a music mode featuring more than 150 songs. The collection includes:\nMega Man Battle Network\nMega Man Battle Network 2\nMega Man Battle Network 3 White\nMega Man Battle Network 3 Blue\nMega Man Battle Network 4 Red Sun\nMega Man Battle Network 4 Blue Moon\nMega Man Battle Network 5 Team Protoman\nMega Man Battle Network 5 Team Colonel\nMega Man Battle Network 6 Cybeast Gregar\nMega Man Battle Network 6 Cybeast Falzar\nMega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection is slated for PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC and launches in 2023.",

          "description": "Konami announced Super Bomberman R 2, a successor to the Switch launch title Super Bomberman R. In addition to announcing the game, we also got our first look at a promising new way to play called Castle Mode and a release window.\n\n\nIn the asymmetric multiplayer Castle Mode, a team of 15 players must blast their way to treasure chests scattered across the battlefield. Meanwhile, a solo player tries their best to hold them off. On top of what sounds like a wild mess of action, players can create and share their own battle stages for the mode, adding a ton to the replayability potential of this new form of play.\nWhen the first Super Bomberman R launched in 2017, I heavily criticized it for poor network performance, frustrating level design, and an overall lack of content. However, in the years since, the developers have improved the title through various updates and expanded the Switch-exclusive game to also appear on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. Hopefully, the development team learned from its mistakes with Super Bomberman R 2 and delivers a stronger product at launch. The aforementioned Castle Mode looks like a good time, so I'm hopeful. Super Bomberman R 2 arrives in 2023. It will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles as well as Switch and PC.",

The expansion, available this week, delivers a hearty amount of content by adding new biomes to explore and creatures to track down/battle.

That update also adds rare species monsters, special species monsters, and a new locale in the Forlorn Arena. Later this fall, a second free title update adds more rare species monsters, subspecies monsters, and powered-up monsters. A third free title update is scheduled for this winter, promising several special species monsters and powered-up monsters.

Today, the team released another video spanning almost five minutes that highlights some of the well-worn and lesser-known locales of London that players can visit when the mod is released. \nAnd speaking of release, today’s trailer revealed that Fallout: London will be released in 2023, as reported by IGN. The release window comes after a stunning four minutes of in-game footage. Had I not known Fallout: London was a mod, I probably would have assumed it was a brand-new chapter in the franchise – that’s how good this looks! Check it out for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer, players can expect to see Tower Bridge, Big Ben, and more. Plus, the trailer hints that players won’t win every battle with bullets – they might be going medieval in some quests, donning a knight’s armor and taking down enemies with a sword. Everything about this trailer is exciting. Fortunately, Fallout: London is releasing sometime next year. \nHere’s some more information about the mod straight from the team: \nFor more, check out the Fallout: London reveal trailer from last year and then read Game Informer’s Fallout 4 review.\n[Source: IGN]\nAre you excited about Fallout: London?

The latter party apparently included Legend of Zelda creator Shigeru Miyamoto. \nAccording to a translation of an old issue of Nintendo Dream Magazine by DidYouKnowGaming, Wind Waker director Eiji Aonuma said Miyamoto “literally cringed” when he first saw the game’s visual style, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. \n\n\n“If I had gone and talked to him from the very beginning, I think he would’ve said ‘How is that Zelda?'.\" Aonuma said in the magazine. “Miyamoto had trouble letting go of the realistic Link art style until the very end.\n“At some point, he had to give a presentation against his will. That’s when he said something to me like, ‘You know, it’s not too late to change course and make a realistic Zelda.'” \nMiyamoto is a legend, obviously, but it might’ve been a good thing that Aonuma trusted he and his team’s instinct and continued forward with Wind Waker’s art style – the game’s all the more memorable for it. \nFor more about Miyamoto, read how he wants to make the world a better place and then check out this story about how the latest Zelda, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2 (or whatever its sequel ends up being titled) has been delayed out of 2022 and into spring of 2023.  \n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]\nWhat are your thoughts on Wind Waker?

Our solar system’s largest planet may play host to a seemingly eternal storm, but something far fiercer is brewing on Callisto. It’s here that the creator of the Dead Space series, Glen Schofield, stages perhaps his most horrifying project yet.\nSet 300 years in the future, The Callisto Protocol unmistakably carries Schofield’s creative DNA, but through innovative technology, an uncompromised vision, and lessons learned from decades of development experience, Striking Distance Studios feels it has something more than a spiritual successor on its hands. The Callisto Protocol challenges players to face their fears as they descend into the depths of a lunar prison overrun by monstrous, infected humans and uncover what happened to one of our great hopes for life beyond Earth. We witnessed never-before-seen gameplay and spent hours picking the brains of Striking Distance Studios’ veteran developers to learn how this team is creating one of the scariest, most intense games of 2022.\nIn 2019, Schofield took a trip out to the desert to get away from the hustle and bustle of the game industry. Just months prior, he had left Activision, a publisher with whom he had worked for nearly a decade. While there, he helped lead a studio he cofounded, Sledgehammer Games, as it worked on three mainline Call of Duty titles: Modern Warfare 3, Advanced Warfare, and WWII. Schofield eventually transitioned to an executive role within Activision before leaving the company less than a year later. He decided to take some time off and plot his next move.\nRead more...",

In one answer, the folks from Blizz confirm an interesting detail about OW2 when it hits Early Access in the first week of October: it’ll replace the original Overwatch entirely.\nWhen OW2 launches on Oct 4th it will be a replacement for the current Live Service.\n\nRather than being a separate app on your console of choice or the Blizzard launcher, Overwatch 2 won’t be built up bit by bit on its own but will take the place of the original game and build off of that instead.\nWhile Overwatch 1 and 2 have always been planned to be tied together into a single client and overall roadmap, this is the first time Blizzard has announced publically that Overwatch 1 will cease to exist entirely when the sequel launches. Get your 6v6 games in now because they won’t be playable as of the OW2 Early Access launch.\nAlso of note from this quote is the timeframe of PvE content coming to OW2. Its initial Early Access content this year will provide a revamp to the PvP experience with new heroes, maps, modes, etc., but the long-touted narrative content for the sequel will be coming sometime in 2023 instead of with the rest of the package.\nOverwatch 2 will be free-to-play starting on October 4 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",

          "description": "Illumination’s upcoming animated Mario movie was recently delayed to next spring. Perhaps the biggest downside to that news is the fact that we have to go even longer before hearing what Chris Pratt’s Mario voice sounds like. Today, Variety caught up with Pratt to ask about the film, with the actor describing his take on Mario as “unlike anything you’ve heard in the Mario world before.”\nFor those unaware, Pratt portrays Mario in the film and much the biggest buzz around the film has centered on his voice. Some have expressed concern about a non-Italian playing an Italian character and the voice potentially being offensive while the film’s co-producer described Pratt’s performance as “phenomenal.” \nSpeaking to Variety, Pratt discusses how he experimented with the voice and worked closely with directors to find a unique take on Mario that he felt proud of, saying in part “It’s an animated voiceover narrative. It’s not a live-action movie. I’m not gonna be wearing a plumber suit running all over. I’m providing a voice for an animated character, and it is updated and unlike anything you’ve heard in the Mario world before.”\nRegardless of what Pratt sounds like, Nintendo is reportedly happy with the film, which was said to be mostly finished last November, so Illumination must be doing something right. The Mario movie is slated to premiere in U.S. theaters on April 7. In addition to Chris Pratt’s Mario, the cast includes Charlie Day (Luigi), Anya Taylor-Joy (Peach), Jack Black (Bowser), Keegan-Michael Key (Toad), and Seth Rogen (Donkey Kong).  \n[Source: Variety]",

          "description": "Despite being heavily criticized for his role in Activision Blizzard’s ongoing employee sexual abuse scandal, CEO Bobby Kotick will remain on the company’s board of directors for another year.\nThe publisher held its annual meeting of stockholders, who voted on five proposals, such as its list of ten directors, including Kotick, to serve one-year terms. The document detailing the results shows that an overwhelming 533,703,580 investors voted in Kotick’s favor against 62,597,199 who voted against him. 2,162,178 shareholders abstained from voting.\nThe result means that Kotick retains his spot until Activision’s 2023 stockholder meeting next June. The development comes after Kotick spent the last year under fire for reportedly hiding details of the company’s abuse problems from shareholders, which caused some employees and investors to call for his resignation. Kotick has responded by reducing his salary until “transformational gender goals” were met. Activision has since hired new chief diversity, equity, and inclusion officer. \nAlthough Kotick remains on Activision’s board, his future as CEO once Microsoft’s acquisition of the company is complete remains unknown. The deal isn’t expected to go through until sometime next summer, possibly around the time of the next stockholder meeting.",

Jane will become available as part of the 2.5 update, which arrives just a day later on June 28. That should whet fans' appetite for the character's Norse-powered return in the upcoming Thor: Love & Thunder, which hits theaters on July 8. \nIt'll be interesting to see how Crystal Dynamics differentiates Jane's moveset from Thor's. In the comics, Jane possessed all of the abilities of Thor during her time as the Goddess of Thunder. The only notable difference was her ability to manipulate Mjolnir with greater control and creativity (especially when throwing it) than her predecessors, so that's something the studio can certainly hone in and expand upon. \nFor more on Marvel's Avengers, check out our evolving list of every playable hero in the game.",

It first established its headquarters in Sunnyvale, California, neighbor to a host of now-famous tech startups. The new logo, a callback to the retro design of the old location, features the company’s classic branding alongside a semi-transparent “50.” Atari is calling the limited-time celebration logo “Borregas” after the street where you could find the headquarters. According to the company, this design will join with the previously revealed “Sunnyvale” anniversary logo in gracing the many upcoming corporate announcements, game reveals, partnerships, and merchandising collaborations.\n “Design innovation was a fundamental driver and differentiator for Atari during the golden age of video games,” said Wade Rosen, CEO of Atari. “Every artist, designer, and engineer challenged themselves to reach creative excellence; it is a hallmark of Atari that persists to this day.”\nIn the midst of the logo’s reveal, it also looks like an Atari classic is getting a revival. According to Gamerbraves, a follow-up to Yar’s Revenge is in the works. The information comes straight from Howard Scott Warshaw, who worked at Atari in the ‘80s and created the title for the Atari 2600. The interview contained few concrete details on the project, just that it seems the sequel has been greenlit. Hopefully, we will hear more about the game as development continues.",

The title is described as a multiplayer, multi-team heist experience set in space with a punky comic book aesthetic. What this means practically is players can jump into five teams of three to battle each other over a prize and \"engage, evade, exploit, and steal their way to victory.\" The game's debut trailer shows off some fast-pasted action, but to see everything for yourself, you can check out the trailer below.\n\n\nThe story envisions a world in which the billionaires have finally made it to mars, destroying Earth in the process. However, the rich get nostalgic for their former planet's culture. So, they send out ships to collect plunder from the remnants of Earth's poor survivors. Not content to take this sitting down, the Hyenas are fighting back.\nThe game is still in early development, so the creators have not revealed the release date, but we do know the game is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Though it's still a ways off, you can sign up for Hyenas' alpha today, and you can learn much more about the title in IGN's Summer of Gaming interview-filled stream.",
