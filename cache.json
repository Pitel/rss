This one is seemingly a little different from the usual ones. Instead of another stock-standard renewal, it actually seems to have been updated to mention \"downloadable programs for portable and electronic consoles\".\nIt's already ignited speculation that something video game-related could be on the way to the Nintendo Switch. In saying this, it should probably be treated as nothing more than a simple update potentially just future-proofing the Donkey Kong series.

The beginning of the game consists of simple platforming challenges revolving around this mechanic.

Regardless, Amazon’s Prime Day landing page is already a gateway into some decent discounts on peripherals, SSDs, gaming monitors and the like, so take a look if you’re of a more urgent mind. Unlike the bulk of actual Prime Day deals, the ones you’ll find listed here don’t even need an Amazon Prime account to access.\nPrevious Prime Days have driven competing retailers to knock down some of their own prices, and this year looks to be no different, so I’ve included some good sales from non-Amazon retailers as well. For the 12th and 13th we’ll also post a full anti-Prime Day deals guide (like last year's), so you can still make some savings even if you’re avoiding Amazon specifically.\nRead more",

Announced earlier this week as part of the game's 10.0.2 patch notes, enabling DLSS does bring some welcome frame rate improvements to proceedings, but it also, err... has the rather unexpected side effect of shaving off everyone's hair / fur.

After one of the busiest starts to the gaming calendar in recent memory (looking at you, Elden Ring), my backlog is barely keeping it together right now. I've started so many things on as many different services that just keeping track of what I've played when is fast becoming a second job. If you, too, have been feeling overwhelmed by the sheer number of new and exciting releases coming out, then why not have a gander at this freshly compiled list of all our favourite games from the year so far? Maybe you'll find something that will similarly catch your eye, just as it's done ours. I'll warn you now, though. It's a big list. \nRead more",

All them lambs being sacrificed in the Old Testament, shepherds, flocks, the lion and the lamb. In Cult Of The Lamb, which is sort of a dungeon-crawling roguelite with a colony sim bolted on, you are a literal rather than metaphorical lamb. Although possibly also a metaphorical lamb. Point is, the game makes great hay from the juxtaposition of cute fluffy animals and a violent cult.\nRead more",

I found Rise to be a substantially better-paced MonHunt entry compared to its predecessors, the series’ steep barrier to entry readjusted to a gentle incline that was more palatable for newcomers like me. Monster Hunter’s particular flavour of RPG design has always felt like trying to find a fork in a friend’s kitchen while they’re in another room. Nothing is where you expect it to be and there are a lot of things here you just don’t understand. Admittedly Rise wasn’t much better, stuffed as it was with endless text-based tutorials, but at the very least it pointed out the right drawer this time around. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Lots of things with no end, basically. It's also a sort of sequel to Dungeon Of The Endless, a turn-based game from 2014 that laid a lot of the groundwork for Endless Dungeon's core loop of dungeon runs and wave survival. I got to sample one of its earliest levels with three different heroes in a recent hour long preview session, but came away with mixed feelings. If you can get a foothold in a run it's fantastic, but getting that foothold can be frustrating in its current state.\nRead more",

Whenever it starts, I tend to drop whatever I'm doing - work, dishes, significant other - and I'll be out frolicking in the downpour before they've hit the floor.\nBecause I love rain so much, I hold games to an almost unfair standard when it comes to the simulation of precipitation. How in the world can a videogame come close to emulating that wonderful, transcendental feeling of being outside in the middle of a thunderstorm? The answer is, it can't. Games have to rely on other things, like textures, sounds, and clever little animations to really sell the idea of being out amongst the H₂s and the Os.\nThe time has come, fellow pluviophiles. It's time to grade the very best rain that PC gaming has to offer. Below you'll find our eight worthy contenders. Each has been chosen for their spectacular rendition of one of nature's greatest phenomena. Each one shall be marked according to my patented and cutting-edge WIPERS grading system for digital rain.

          "description": "I still don't know whether to describe The Heroic Legend Of Eagarlnia as \"complicated\" or \"simple\". Before starting a game, it gives an impression of being a complex grand strategy that's something like a fantasy Total War with a D&D alignment system and a distinctly East Asian focus on characters and dialogue.\nIt's far simpler than that. There was a period of disappointment, even, when it seemed like there wasn't much to it at all. That's partly because it's easy to play it too passively, or get stuck in attritional stand offs, and partly because of the need for a bit too much repetition. But over time its subtler details become more apparent, and your choices start to feel more multifaceted.\nAnd yet, it remains at heart the same throughout. On your first ten turns you're doing the same actions as in your 200th, and its battles in particular are largely hands off. So maybe it's complicated, but simple to actually play? Hmm.\nRead more",

Oxenfree was good, and Oxenfree II looks to be doing those same things that made Oxenfree good. A 2D, side-on supernatural thriller with radios. Good thing remains good! In a world where sequels to beloved media seem to only get progressively worse, I'll happily take it (especially since this one is a Netflix-published project now). And although it's directly related to the first game, the characters and happenings in Oxenfree II are distinct enough that it's going to be accessible if you're new to the series. And even if you did play the first game, it's possible that Oxenfree II will be more thrilling and unsettling to you now, five years later.\nRead more",

Developed and released by Namco as something as an answer to smash hit Space Harrier, the game features the fast-paced, into-the-screen shmup action as the Sega classic, complete with dazzling colors and incredibly fast-paced galactic gameplay. Check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber SidRetron.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv4nRyFUNJA\nAt the time, Thunder Ceptor was by far Namco's most technically advanced and resource-heavy release yet, and is also the first-ever video game to feature a 360-degree yoke controller. Like Space Harrier, Namco's offering also boasted an impressive sit-in arcade cabinet. Not content with this all this extravagance, Namco would offer up revamp-cum-sequel 3D Thunder Ceptor II later that same year, which added stereoscopic 3D visuals to allow for further immersion and/or headaches.\nSurprisingly, however, Thunder Ceptor has not seen the same level of celebration as many of Namco's other releases, having been frequently left off of multiple retro compilations, leaving the 3D shmup to fall between the cracks of the company's long-term history. While not as slick or as polished as its inspiration, the pretender still brought a few cool tricks to the arcade dance hall, and its resurrection through the Arcade Archives range has been a long time coming.\nThunder Ceptor is available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch now.\nThe post Lost Namco release Thunder Ceptor hits the Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

A new Panel From Hell is on the way, unveiling the also-incoming Patch 8 for Baldur's Gate 3.\nThe next Panel From Hell, Larian's regular showcase for new Baldur's Gate 3 content, will air on July 7 at 10 a.m. PT / 1 p.m. ET. You can follow the countdown and site here, or keep an eye on Larian's Twitch channel. The company rented out a theatre in Ghent for the occasion, so expect at least a little bit of pageantry.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uqvdsgzO8U\nPanels From Hell usually coincide with new patches for Baldur's Gate 3, and this one seems no different. Larian posted a PSA today for the upcoming Patch 8, confirming that this update will indeed render old saves incompatible. The team is keeping beta branches up so players can keep running their old files if they'd like, though with this new update, Larian will only keep the two most recent patches active. This means Patch 6 and 7, alongside the incoming Patch 8. You can find easy-to-follow instructions on opting into beta branches here.\nA hefty update\nPrevious patches have added everything from new story content and areas to explore to new classes, though there's not much of a hint what'll happen in Patch 8.\nWhat we do know is that it will be a fairly hefty update, file size-wise. Larian's post says this update will be roughly 40 GB, bringing the total file size of Baldur's Gate 3 up to 104 GB of storage space.\nWhatever is on the way, I'm down for more. Larian has been up-front in saying that 2023 is its target for leaving Early Access, and I'm eager to see what it's building up to for the full game.\nThe post A new Baldur’s Gate 3 patch and panel are on the way appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The team started building Fire Emblem Warriors 2, then pivoted\nAccording to a new interview via Nintendo Dream magazine (translated by Nintendo Everything), the Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes team had a different idea in mind for the follow-up to the original.\nThis notion is straight from the production team (including producers Yosuke Hayashi and Hideo Suzuki), who stated that they had helped work on Three Houses with Nintendo and Intelligent Systems, right after Fire Emblem Warriors development ended. After that lengthy and fruitful partnership between the three entities, they proposed a direct sequel for FE Warriors.\nHayashi recalls that it was originally titled \"Fire Emblem Warriors 2,\" but everything pivoted when the concept of slotting the game into the Three Houses universe came to light. The decision was a no-brainer because of the \"good reception and the setting,\" which made it an obvious choice for a sequel. The collective says it was \"what the audience would want the most,\" and I think they nailed it!\nSuzuki also muses a bit on how it all came to pass, and the decision to downplay other parts of Fire Emblem history was made to focus entirely on Three Houses:\n\"It ended up as the phantom proposal (laughs). The direction may have changed, but we’re fans of Fire Emblem: Three Houses, so we were more glad than anything to have the opportunity to create a Warriors title in that setting.\"\n\nTo put it bluntly: good! The first Fire Emblem Warriors didn't really have the same oomph, as it attempted to juggle a lot. The storyline wasn't nearly as cohesive as it could have been, and the idea to tackle a parallel universe with Three Hopes was a smart plan. It helps differentiate the original Switch strategy game completely, while providing a new take on the world.\nThe post Originally, Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes wasn’t going to have a Three Houses focus appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "NieR: Automata Switch is 720p in portable mode\nWe have confirmation of NieR: Automata Switch specs and things are looking good!\nAnnounced very plainly on Twitter thanks to the NieR Japan account, Square Enix states that the resolution for docked/TV mode is 1920x1080p, with concessions for 1280x720p in tabletop/portable mode. They also clearly state the framerate: 30FPS. Well, that's pretty cut and dried!\nThis is important to note, as the account is tweeting out new details in regards to the Switch port of the game, following the reveal in the Nintendo Direct Mini. Some folks were noting that the Square Enix site stated a \"60 FPS\" framerate, but that figure seems to be copied and pasted from the Yorha Edition specs on other platforms. We've reached out for clarification on the matter, but until then we're confident that 30 FPS is the target for Switch.\nAs a reminder, NieR Automata is out on October 6 on the Switch platform. Thankfully, it will not be a cloud-based nonsense release! Take that Kingdom Hearts. While the jury is out on how stable the game actually is in the end, it looks like Square Enix is perfectly capable of putting out non-cloud ports. Hopefully this is a sign of things to come for the Switch and not an outlier.\nNieR: Automata Switch specs confirmation:\nhttps://twitter.com/NieR_JPN/status/1541793467428311042\nThe post Square Enix confirms NieR: Automata Switch is 1080p docked, 30 FPS appeared first on Destructoid.",

While these types of changes are fairly common, it doesn't make it any less funny. Over on Twitter, user whisperwolf brought it to my attention, spotting the differences that I'm sure a lot of folks had already seen.\nThen the comparisons started coming in, calling it a \"Kirby moment,\" a classic example of a character that gets more lighthearted or serious depending on the region:\nhttps://twitter.com/whisperwoIf/status/1542173257415147522\nAnother person reminds us of another Sonic 2 angry Tails makeover.

Tails, by nature, is a free spirit. You can see this trait in pretty much everything he's in, from Sonic 2 to the Sonic Boom TV show. Every so often Tails can get down to it and save the day (especially when he needs to step up after a Sonic absence), but his kind heart is what sets him apart from the otherwise stoic and wisecracking cast of friends.\nBet you didn't expect a Tails character breakdown this weekend eh?

I love recommending it to anyone who will listen, but something I forget is just how text-heavy that game is. I'm an avid reader, but for others, the game's script, which clocks in at over a million words, can be pretty intimidating. The good news is, though, that the developers at ZA/UM are well aware of this fact, and have made a bunch of great changes since the game has come out to help make the game accessible to as wide of an audience as possible. Disco Elysium: The Final Cut introduced a fully-voiced experience, but the newest addition is yesterday's free update that added dyslexia-friendly fonts.\nThe font used for most languages is called OpenDyslexic, which was designed to mitigate common reading mistakes that those with dyslexia can make. The great thing is that the font's creators made it open source, so that anyone can use it if needed.\nIn Disco Elysium specifically, OpenDyslexic is used for the English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese-Brazilian, and Polish versions of the game. Other languages have also been accounted for — the Korean version uses a font called Nanum Square Round, while the Russian version uses Adys.\nZA/UM also stated that they're still investigating options for both traditional and simplified Chinese.\n\nThe devs shared their thoughts in Steam blog post that announced the update: \"It’s important, especially for a game with over a million words, that we continue to make improvements to ensure everyone can have the best user experience during their time in Revachol.\"\nIt's great to see yet another studio taking down as many barriers to entry as they can -- it feels like the games space is only becoming a more thoughtful and considerate space (for the most part).\nThe dyslexia-friendly font update is available to download now, wherever you can play Disco Elysium.\nThe post Disco Elysium gets a free update with new dyslexia-friendly fonts appeared first on Destructoid.",

A little stressful, I might add, because it all dropped at once with a giant VOD, but once we all got through it together and figured out what was actually new, it was fine.

And being that it's currently focusing on one project, the studio says it's not working on any other one of its properties.\n\"As our games continue to grow in scale and complexity, they require the full attention of our studio. With our focus on our current project, we have no plans to revisit inFAMOUS or Sly Cooper right now, and no other studio is currently working on projects related to those franchises either.

The Cole's Legacy DLC for inFAMOUS Second Son will also be put up on the PlayStation Store in all territories soon.\nIt's a bit of a strange announcement, though there have been rumors in the past of a return to Sly Cooper revival and the like.

Airplanes.\nLong-time publisher Bandai Namco has announced that it has partnered with Japanese studio Ilca to form a brand new development division, monikered Bandai Namco Aces.\n\"With the recent remarkable growth of the global game market, the demand for more high-end games is increasing,\" wrote Bandai Namco Aces on its new website. \"On this basis, in order to deliver high-end games that exceed the expectations of fans around the world, we have decided to establish a new company to strengthen our capacities to develop games with hyper-photorealistic expression.\"\n\"Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc. has cultivated its expertise in game production through its production of the Tekken series and the Ace Combat series. Ilca has the technical capabilities to produce high-quality content using state-of-the-art technology. Going forward, while leveraging the strengths and know-how of both companies, we will continue to deliver high-quality contents that can be played in-depth and for a long time to fans around the world.\"\nThe Ilca team will lead development in the new division, assisted by its new vice president, Kazutoki Kono. Kono is a veteran producer and director of the popular flight adventure series Ace Combat. And given the \"Aces\" branding of Bandai Namco's new division, one would assume that it is set to be preliminarily focused on the dogfighting series, which is now in its 27th year.\nThe most recent title in the series, Ace Combat 7, came out in 2019 on PS4, PC, and Xbox One. The acclaimed release recently received new content in the form of a Top Gun: Maverick DLC drop.\nThe post Bandai Namco partners with studio Ilca to form Bandai Namco Aces division appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It kicks off on July 11\nThe Pokemon Sword and Shield wild area is getting a change-up in a little over a week, as The Pokemon Company has announced a new event is on the horizon.\nStarting on July 11 at 8:59 JST, Poliwag, Marill, and Spheal will appear in greater number, particularly when it comes to the Wild Area nests: including shiny encounters. The Pokemon Company says it's a way to enjoy the \"hot summer.\" As a note, a lot of folks have been hunting for that shiny Marill, and the green-colored creature is fully confirmed to appear at a 2% rate in five-star raids.\nAs a reminder, the Sword and Shield Wild Area is periodically changed to suit different events and rotates around a selection of Pokemon. For getting a full 'Dex, it was a really fun experience to dive in and check out different weather patterns and locales for creatures — and helped extend my playthrough of the pair of games quite a bit.\nIt's interesting, because the Sword and Shield Wild Area both feels malleable and static at the same time. If Scarlet and Violet (and future games, really) want to go the route of \"everything is the wild area\" in the future, it opens up a bit more — but the team likely isn't going to completely rework the entire game for little micro-events like this.\nWhile the Wild Area was an experiment of sorts, it ended up becoming one of my favorite elements of any modern Pokemon game.\nThe post The Pokemon Sword and Shield wild area is getting a water-based makeover event appeared first on Destructoid.",

I mean, it only makes sense with Nomura connected to both!\nCrafted by ColossalCake (great name, I could use a colossal cake this weekend) and housed on NexusMods, the Kingdom Hearts Cloud mod is simple and breezy, and swaps the core character model of Cloud for the one featured in Kingdom Hearts. That includes his memorable little infernal wing and red scarf, as well as the extremely Nomura-heavy bandaged sword. As the creator puts it:\n\"Cloud as redesigned in Kingdom Hearts. I chose to remove his cape however, as there wasn't any clean way for it to be supported by the armature. His sword is also mostly the original FFVII:R mesh, with the bandages adapted on top.\"\n\nApparently most of the texture legwork was done by Dissidia Final Fantasy NT, with adjustments done by the modder. At this point, the Final Fantasy VII Remake modding scene has multiple pipelines and paths to success, with mesh importers and modding tools available to help ease the process. It's great!

The humble puzzle Shovel Knight spin-off is already packed with playable characters and other ways to change up the experience, but the unrelenting teams at Vine and Yacht Club Games won't be satisfied until everyone on Earth understands that this game is a blast, and the only way to do that is to coax the global population into trying it. And what better way to do that than with free DLC?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujvmJ5fA6l8\nStarting today on Steam (and coming soon to consoles), the Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon Puzzler's Pack DLC is open for business, offering up new playable characters like Mona the alchemist and Puzzle Knight the nogoodnik.\nMona can chain potion explosions for massive combos, and the Puzzle Knight can turn enemies around clockwise to change their overall effect on the battlefield. These unique strategy options are compounded by two new relics, two areas to explore, and new challenges. And this Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon DLC is just the start. Mod support — and the option to refract and enhance your character's abilities — are all coming soon.\nThe team at Yacht Club truly wants Pocket Dungeon to be a game of the people. That's why they are opening their discord channel to all comers to discuss what they do and don't want in the game. The plan is to keep updating this Puzzle Pack for as long as possible. Remember folks, the original Shovel Knight received massive free updates over the course of five years, so who knows how far they'll go. If you want to learn more about them and why they are so unrelentingly giving, check out the 8,000-plus-word interview I did with them in Lock-On 004.

          "description": "This feels like a marketing move from 2010\nRemember roughly 10 years ago, when companies were trying to brainwash people into hating single-player games? It was kind of an awful time for gaming, full of \"Project 10 Dollar\" chicanery (when publishers would put $10 passes in their games to launch content, to avoid used game sales), copious on-disc DLC, and forced multiplayer that sometimes shut down mere months after launch. Well, this EA single-player games tweet brings me back to all that:\nhttps://twitter.com/EA/status/1542652454159798272\nBad idea to tweet this in 2022, right? Not to mention the entire vibe of the tweet (which is taken from a TikTok trend) feels like a joke from a decade ago? So like, I kinda get someone making the call (whether it was higher up or not) to make an out-of-touch tweet like that: at another studio, if that. But EA literally has had a bad history with dunking on single-player games, and is actively making some now, like the Jedi: Fallen Order sequel. This was exacerbated by Vince Zampella (who helps run the studio that makes the Fallen Order series) tweeting out a \"man facepalming\" emoji in direct response.\nThings got a lot tenser, too, as Zach Mumbach, a former EA/Visceral Games employee (the studio of Dead Space fame, among many other games like Dante's Inferno), stated that \"this is the company that shut down my studio and laid off ~100 great developers because we were making a single-player game.\" They were likely referring to Visceral's Star Wars game. Someone else tweeted out a list of games and IP that went to EA to essentially die.\nEventually, EA admitted defeat:\nhttps://twitter.com/EA/status/1542706383694565378\nBut the damage was already done. Users reminisced about the publisher's various deeds, and former and current employees mused on how volatile it can be to work for EA. It just goes to show you: not every meme trend is worth chasing, especially if you're a brand.\nThe post EA completely roasted over bad single-player games tweet appeared first on Destructoid.",

In the preview, we meet inventor Remi De La Rosa, hunter extraordinaire Devinder Crousley, the trigger-happy Jacob Boyer, and the telepath Layla Ellison, all of whom sound as if they were named by NXT development.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwY9IncC6XI&t\nBlending seamless single and multiplayer options, Redfall will allow players to choose and customize their character as best fits the battle, making adjustments for loadouts, skills, and special abilities. By forming strong, synergized builds with your fellow teammates, the four heroes will offer a threat to the huge number of bad beasties that wait within the parks, buildings, restaurants, and tourist traps of this once quaint community.\nWith large open-world areas, a dazzling array of makeshift weaponry, and oodles of style and charisma, Redfall hopes to capture the co-op horror market on release, offering an alternate to some of the team-shooter titles currently available in the genre. While the development team was unfortunately forced to delay the title to allow for extra polish to the \"ambitious\" release, Redfall is now expected to launch in early 2023 on PC and Xbox Series X.\nThe post Redfall trailer introduces you to its vampire-filled city streets appeared first on Destructoid.",

Sadly, matters only escalated, encouraging Barlog to return to social media asking for — of all basic necessities — \"human decency.\" Vidya Gamez.\nBarlog's comments came after a fresh surge of fan outrage when June 30 did not result in the (purely rumored) release date reveal for the highly anticipated sequel. Among a litany of complaints, tantrums, and outright threats, one of Ragnarok's developers actually received explicit images in their inbox, along with yet another demand for the title's release date.\nBarlog, who I only yesterday described as someone who tends to deal with such scenario…",

          "description": "Starting a cult isn’t easy work, but somebody’s got to do it in Massive Monster’s Cult of the Lamb, which hits consoles and PC next month. Fortunately, the team behind the devilishly cute game has released a new trailer with tips and tricks to start, and maintain, the best cult.\nThe first step is simple: grow your flock. All you need to do is fight through hordes of demon monsters to save innocent woodland creatures that will make for perfect initiates. Of course, you rename each addition and select other facets of their new life to dictate what kind of cult member (and worker) they’ll be for you.\nCheck it out in action: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, growing your flock is just the first step. You also need to satisfy the faithful. To do this, you must tend to your congregation by leading and feeding them and ultimately keeping them happy. You can give them gifts, invite them to feasts, and much more. The final step is to cleanse the non-believers, naturally. \nUnhappy cult members might lose faith in you, but this is fixable. You can opt to re-educate them in the ways of your cult, which will hopefully stop them from persuading other members to rise against you, or, if you just can’t see a solution, you can always sacrifice them to the gods. \nAnd there you have it – you’re ready to start a cult. For more, watch Game Informer’s exclusive Cult of the Lamb New Gameplay Today, which features never-before-seen gameplay, and then watch this new gameplay trailer that recently debuted during Summer Game Fest, which is where we learned Cult of the Lamb will come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on Aug. 11. \nAre you excited for Cult of the Lamb?

That means the console looks like a big, cracked slab of dwarven-crafted uru that still channels electricity and may or may not be liftable depending on if you’re worthy. It's hard to tell if that handle is real or simply edited into the photo for full effect, but you should probably assume the worst (best?) when considering making space for this thing. \nThe contest begins today and concludes on July 21.

The idea of getting a demo this year is certainly enticing too, as Sea of Stars has looked phenomenal every time it’s made an appearance. \nThe game was first revealed in 2020 after a successful Kickstarter campaign and evokes JRPGs like Chrono Trigger, Illusion of Gaia, and Breath of Fire. It even features music contributions by Chrono Trigger composer Yasunori Mitsuda. Despite being a role-playing title, it serves as a prequel to 2018’s The Messenger, a Ninja Gaiden-inspired action game that was well-recieved (here’s our review). Sea of Stars centers on two heroes who wield the power of the moon and the sun to battle an evil alchemist. You can watch the original reveal trailer below.",

In Pow Wow Entertainment's newly announced racer, Stuntfest: World Tour, I'm hoping the unique ejector-seat functionality is so jaw-droppingly incredible that it becomes the next craze. In the game's first trailer, we see drivers rocketing out of their cars to bounce off pads or ignite a jetpack's thrusters.\nStuntfest: World Tour is in development for PC with publishing duties handled by THQ Nordic sometime in 2022. We don't have many details yet, but a press release states that the player can assume the identity of a \"punker granny\" or a \"famous streamer\" with the hope of winning elimination-style stunt shows featuring 18 drivers. The competitions range from destruction derbies to glider racers. When the player hits the ejector button and their driver launches hundreds of meters into the air, they can be freely controlled and gadgets can be used to gain an edge. When descending, the next car you see can be yours to drive. Progress in the world tour rewards you with vehicle upgrades.\nStuntfest: World Tour has a hell of a hook, but it's difficult to figure out how these races will unfold. I can't wait to get my hands on this game to see if this unique gimmick (and the high levels of destruction) add up to something special.",

As EA notes, you cannot share your videos or screenshots from your play sessions.\nIf you are curious what Skate currently looks like or what you can expect from the gameplay, EA has released a trailer with the appropriate title \"Still working on it.\" The first few clips focus on bails, which must have been captured early in development given how rough the animations are. As the trailer moves on, the animations smooth out and the series' skating realism returns and is on display in a handful of awesome sequences. Full Circle also looks to be upping the scale of the challenges through some wild clips featuring impossible grind opportunities and huge ramps. Most of these clips are lack any kind of texturing or lighting and truly give us a look at how games are made.\nRegardless of where it is at in development, this trailer gives a fun look at a series that never should have left us.

Check out the short trailer below; it's as deliciously chaotic as you'd expect. \nThere was once a group of warriors who attempted to defeat the darkness.\n@FinalFantasy Origin's first expansion Trials of the Dragon King launches July 20th. pic.twitter.com/YvGEwGh1ux\nJune 30, 2022\nIn Stranger of Paradise fashion, it's hard to parse through what's happening in the footage, but we see Jack and co. cleaving their way through armored adversaries ranging from shield-holding knights to winged beasts with dazzling blades of their own. In one scene, a kingly figure sits upon a throne – is it safe to assume this is the Dragon King? – and says, \"You will die here, and I will live forever.\" We're sure Jack will make him eat his words. \nStranger of Paradise is as bizarre as Final Fantasy gets. Andrew Reiner gave the game a 7 out of 10 and concluded his review by saying, \"Stranger of Paradise is the strangest Final Fantasy game yet, bounding wildly between awful and fantastic. If you can tolerate Jack (and that's a big ask), the excellently crafted combat is worth a look. You may be coming to this game for the story and Final Fantasy experience, but it's all about combat and little else.\"\nStranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin's first DLC expansion, Trials of the Dragon King, drops on July 20 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

Join us on this fresh episode of New Gameplay Today as we check out the title's latest tank and show off the new map players can get their hands on later this year.\ncoverage here.\n\n\n\nThe Junker Queen is here, and she means business. The leader of the Junkers is more of an offensive tank than some of her other colleagues within the category. She comes strapped with a shotgun that maybe doesn't have the power of Roadhog's but has plenty of damage to dismantle the opposing team. She also comes equipped with a handy throwing knife that can cause quite the commotion. If players land a hit with an electrified weapon, enemy health drops over time. If she misses, the knife can still help as you can call it back, similar to the Leviathan Axe from God of War (2018), and actually pull enemies closer. Pair those abilities with her deadly charge up and a devastating ultimate attack, and she has a chance to really make some waves.\nOn top of a deep dive into Junker Queen and her moveset, we're also showing off the Push game type and Colleseo, a brand new map for Overwatch players to explore and dominate in. Is all this enough to get players to jump back into Overwatch? You'll just have to watch for yourself to find out!",

In fact, the series is going bigger. Much bigger!\n\n\nThe first trailer for Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher asks a crucial question, \"How would you like to raise your very own Ultra Kaiju?\" To which I responded, \"Yes, please. I'd very much like that. Give it to me now.\" Foregoing the dull, average-sized creatures you used to raise in Monster Rancher, Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher lets you take care of some colossal sweet boys. You'll raise the likes of Zettan, Gomora, and Alien Baltan – all licensed Kaiju from the Ultraman franchise. Many other existing Kaiju appear in the game, and you'll take them to help townsfolk in ways only a giant monster could. You can also participate in massive monster battles or watch the colossal beings waddle like big clumsy babies. As a fun bonus, the Kaiju can be bred, making wild combinations of their attributes appear in their children. It all seems like a lot of goofy fun.\nWe're not sure if Ultra Kaiju Monster Rancher is coming to North America, but it's slated to hit Japan and Southeast Asia this year. At the very least, a version will be translated into English for those looking to import.",

In addition to dropping not one, not two, but three videos fleshing out the game's narrative, characters, and combat, we now know the JRPG launches in October. \nThe Divine Force arrives on October 27, exactly one year after it was first announced. The first trailer showcases the plot with a montage of out-of-context story clips that sets the tone for what's to come in the sci-fi action RPG. \n\n\nThe second video provides a more thorough walkthrough of Star Ocean's characters and combat. Players assume the role of one of two protagonists: Raymond Lawrence, a hot-headed merchant ship captain searching for his lost crew, and Laeticia Aucerius, a princess fighting to save her kingdom from destruction. The story unfolds differently depending on your chosen hero, and a ragtag party of allies accompanies each. The action-focused combat utilizes four party members players can swap between on the fly. You can battle in real-time or pause the action using Stop Mode to allow time to change tactics.  \n\n\nLastly, you watch the entire 8-minute opening cinematic for Raymond's campaign to see how the adventure kicks off for the young captain. \n\n\nTri-Ace promises to share more information in a future Mission Report video. Star Ocean The Divine Force will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

In it, the studio revealed that the servers for Spellbreak will shut down in early 2023, effectively ending the run of this battle royale. \nThis shutdown likely had to do with the game’s low player count. Still, there might be more to it than that: Blizzard Entertainment, the studio behind franchises like Overwatch and Warcraft, is acquiring Proletariat and using its force of roughly 100 employees to staff up its World of Warcraft team, according to a new report from GamesBeat. \n“We are putting players at the forefront of everything we do, and we are working hard to both meet and exceed their expectations,” Blizzard president Mike Ybarra told the publication in a statement. “A big part of caring for our teams is making sure we have the resources to produce experiences our communities will love while giving our teams space to explore even more creative opportunities within their projects. Proletariat is a perfect fit for supporting Blizzard’s mission in bringing high-quality content to our players more often.” \nThis news comes just months before the launch of the newest World of Warcraft expansion, Dragonflight, which you can read more about here. As noted by GamesBeat, this acquisition is one of the largest in recent memory for Blizzard. This purchase means that the Proletariat team will be under the Microsoft-Xbox umbrella soon following the completion of Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard.\nAccording to the GamesBeat report, the purpose of this acquisition is to beef up World of Warcraft staff numbers so “that it can hit quality and timing goals for expansions.” Neither of the involved parties has publicly released a price for this transaction.\n[Source: GamesBeat]",

The mobile game launched in 2015 and, in the years that followed, amassed a substantial fanbase that continues to get support from sizeable roster updates. The creators behind Galaxy of Heroes recently formed Azra Games. And the studios’ debut title will appropriately be a collectible and combat RPG called Legions & Legends. \nAzra Games CEO and co-founder Mark Otero excitedly spoke about the announcement of the new game:\n“This will be my ninth collectible and combat RPG, one that builds upon and perfects the genre I’ve spent my entire career developing. I truly believe that we’ve cracked the code for a captivating gameplay experience built around the joys of collecting toys and taking them to battle against each other, just as we used to do when we were kids. At Azra, we’re looking to bring back that excitement of the toy box and playing with friends – remastered for a new generation of players.”\nAzra Games is a blockchain games company. Legions & Legends launches this summer (an exact date wasn’t specified) with the release of the “Genesis Collection” NFTs which generate in-game resources through Ethereum. But what exactly is Legions & Legends? A press release/blog post penned by Otero gives us a brief look into the Legions & Legends’ “uncharted galaxy where magic and technology collide.” \nCivilizations unknown to humankind are at war, and players will be at the forefront of the bloody conflict to claim the galaxy. Three character types can be deployed on the battlefield – Legionnaires, best used in large numbers, Commanders, known for special attacks/buffs, and Behemoths, slow and tanky creatures with devastating power. The aforementioned NFT collection introduces Genesis Explorers, which players can send on Exploration Missions for craftable parts. \nAs Otero put it, “Your journey deep into the Corvus Galaxy awaits.”",

Crystal Dynamics released a pair of videos showcasing her thunder-based abilities, giving fans a look at how she compares to her original male counterpart.\nJane arrives as a free character in all versions of Marvel’s Avengers. The narrative explains that Jane was torn from an alternate reality in which she is the one and only Thor. Odinson renounced Mjolnir following A-Day, and though Jane developed cancer, her transformation into the Goddess of Thunder halted the disease as she battled to protect Inhumans from persecution. One day, a Tachyon Strom caused by AIM opened a portal that dropped Jane into the game’s universe. She joins up with the Avengers to uncover the cause of the rifts and figure out how to return home. \nThe Mighty Thor wields Mjolnir with more precision than Odinson and sports new abilities that highlight her increased finesse. You can watch the War Table video below for a complete breakdown of her skills or watch the video below for a non-commentary gameplay demonstration.\n\n\n\n\nJane’s addition brings the game’s total roster of heroes to 10 on most platforms and 11 on PlayStation, thanks to Spider-Man’s exclusivity.

Combat involves executing team maneuvers with party members, and each character can be outfitted with different jobs that grant unique characteristics, skills, and combat styles. \n\n\nWhen you’re not fighting for the world’s survival, you’ll return to your village to tend to your farm. Raising crops and livestock lets you harvest ingredients for crafting. When the work is done, socializing with townsfolk is another key diversion. Along the way, you’ll meet a cast of characters such as a time traveler from the future, and completing tasks for them grants rewards and improves your bonds with them. \nHarvestella looks intriguing and we can’t wait to see more of it. It’s also not terribly far away, launching November 4 for Switch and PC via Steam.",

Apparently, he's unleashing his full potential and hacking advanced superhero bases to level up his vigilanteism.\n\n\nIn a new character trailer, Robin shows off how he disposes of Gotham's thugs. His standard melee combat is centered around quick attacks and the use of his quarterstaff for leverage and mid-range beatdowns. Robin also has a stealthy element, enabling active camouflage to mask his presence and sneak up on unsuspecting suspects. The most surprising reveal in the trailer is that the Boy Wonder has tapped into the Justice League satellite to enable short-range teleportation to zip around Gotham to get the drop on enemies or make impossible leaps a reality. He's also using holograms to deploy decoys to deceive dummies in combat.\nGotham Knights is looking great after the last couple of trailers, and I'm looking forward to seeing this team take on the Court of Owls when it releases on October 25.",

Initially considered a unique side dish to the main courses that populated the rest of the bundle, Portal quickly gained popularity for its clever design, mind-bending puzzles, and dark humor. In 2011, Valve released a full-fledged sequel, Portal 2.

In addition to announcing the game, we also got our first look at a promising new way to play called Castle Mode and a release window.\n\n\nIn the asymmetric multiplayer Castle Mode, a team of 15 players must blast their way to treasure chests scattered across the battlefield. Meanwhile, a solo player tries their best to hold them off. On top of what sounds like a wild mess of action, players can create and share their own battle stages for the mode, adding a ton to the replayability potential of this new form of play.\nWhen the first Super Bomberman R launched in 2017, I heavily criticized it for poor network performance, frustrating level design, and an overall lack of content. However, in the years since, the developers have improved the title through various updates and expanded the Switch-exclusive game to also appear on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. Hopefully, the development team learned from its mistakes with Super Bomberman R 2 and delivers a stronger product at launch. The aforementioned Castle Mode looks like a good time, so I'm hopeful.

Today, the team released another video spanning almost five minutes that highlights some of the well-worn and lesser-known locales of London that players can visit when the mod is released. \nAnd speaking of release, today’s trailer revealed that Fallout: London will be released in 2023, as reported by IGN. The release window comes after a stunning four minutes of in-game footage. Had I not known Fallout: London was a mod, I probably would have assumed it was a brand-new chapter in the franchise – that’s how good this looks! Check it out for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer, players can expect to see Tower Bridge, Big Ben, and more. Plus, the trailer hints that players won’t win every battle with bullets – they might be going medieval in some quests, donning a knight’s armor and taking down enemies with a sword. Everything about this trailer is exciting. Fortunately, Fallout: London is releasing sometime next year. \nHere’s some more information about the mod straight from the team: \nFor more, check out the Fallout: London reveal trailer from last year and then read Game Informer’s Fallout 4 review.\n[Source: IGN]\nAre you excited about Fallout: London?

Now there's a soiree full of suspects and locations to investigate to find out who did the dirty deed in Murder at Castle Nathria.\n\n\nMurder at Castle Nathria has three key aspects to the set, including a couple of new mechanics to the digital card game. First are ten Legendary Suspects, new legendary minions with one representing each Hearthstone class. These legends include fishy detective Murloc Holmes which allows you to copy cards from your opponent's deck by guessing three questions about cards in their hand or deck correctly and Decima…",

Code: To Jin Yong is an adaptation of a series of wuxia (a genre of fantasy martial arts) novels by acclaimed author Jin Yong, whose works have been extremely popular in China since the 1950s. The game features heroes from Yong’s novels and leverages Unreal 5’s power, such as photogrammetry technology, to create dazzling martial arts combat and physics that fans of wuxia films should appreciate. Check out the gameplay demo below to see it in action. \n\n\nCode: To Jin Yong has no release date or confirmed platforms, but Tencent’s press release states it will be available globally “in the near future.” What do you think of this first look at the title?

Although several big publishers have already pulled out of what’s arguably the biggest convention in gaming, Ubisoft has confirmed it will have a presence at the show.\nSee you at @gamescom!\npic.twitter.com/lPQDovmc1e\nJune 27, 2022\nUbisoft’s attendance is noteworthy because other heavy-hitters such as Nintendo, Sony, Take-Two, and Activision are skipping the show this year. Although there’s no confirmed list of attendees, THQ Nordic will also attend and plans to reveal four unannounced games. \nAs for what Ubisoft has in store, we know that it plans to discuss the future of Assassin’s Creed during its own special event in September, so we probably won’t learn anything substantial about the next mainline entry at Gamescom. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake recently shifted development teams, so it also seems unlikely to reappear. Do we see Skull & Bones, the development of which Ubisoft described as proceeding “well” earlier this year? Splinter Cell Remake? Beyond Good & Evil 2? We’ll have to tune in to find out. \nGamescom takes place from August 24 to 28 in Cologne, Germany, at the Koelnmesse Convention Centre. The event kicks off on August 23 with Opening Night Live, the big showcase of game trailers, reveals, and announcements hosted by Geoff Keighley.",

The devices will also be manufactured at an increased pace, so those who thought they might have to wait a while longer to pick one up may be in luck.\nValve tweeted today from its Steam Deck account that those who preordered the Steam Deck and have an expected Q3 2022 fulfillment date should check their email inboxes starting on June 30. The announcement of the latest group of preorder shipments comes paired with the reveal that Valve is increasing production of the handheld, essentially doubling the previous quarter’s output. \n“Hello! Some great news on the production front. We just sent the last batch of Q2 emails, and we’ll start sending Q3 reservation emails on the 30th,” says the @OnDeck tweet. “Production has picked up, and after today we’ll be shipping more than double the number of Steam Decks every week!”\nHello!

I just got the go-ahead to purchase my Deck last week and can’t wait to get my hands on it to play all the hottest JRPGs from the ’90s and early 2000s instead of new releases like Elden Ring or DNF Duel. Who am I kidding? I’ll be playing those as well. \nIf you’re curious about what the Steam Deck is all about, check out our official review of the device here and this test of 23 games on the device to see what it’s capable of playing. If you’re interested in preordering one for yourself, you can do that by slapping $5 down through the Steam client or website.",

Some were completely on board, ready for this new take on the franchise, while others weren’t too happy about the visual style of the game. The latter party apparently included Legend of Zelda creator Shigeru Miyamoto. \nAccording to a translation of an old issue of Nintendo Dream Magazine by DidYouKnowGaming, Wind Waker director Eiji Aonuma said Miyamoto “literally cringed” when he first saw the game’s visual style, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. \n\n\n“If I had gone and talked to him from the very beginning, I think he would’ve said ‘How is that Zelda?'.\" Aonuma said in the magazine. “Miyamoto had trouble letting go of the realistic Link art style until the very end.\n“At some point, he had to give a presentation against his will. That’s when he said something to me like, ‘You know, it’s not too late to change course and make a realistic Zelda.'” \nMiyamoto is a legend, obviously, but it might’ve been a good thing that Aonuma trusted he and his team’s instinct and continued forward with Wind Waker’s art style – the game’s all the more memorable for it. \nFor more about Miyamoto, read how he wants to make the world a better place and then check out this story about how the latest Zelda, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2 (or whatever its sequel ends up being titled) has been delayed out of 2022 and into spring of 2023.  \n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]\nWhat are your thoughts on Wind Waker?
