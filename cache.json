Still, this doesn't necessarily mean the days of competition are over.\nIn a new Sega interview (translated by Noisypixel's Ryuji), Sega's executive director and self-confessed \"Sonic lover\" Osamu Ohashi mentioned how he personally wants to see Sonic \"catch\" Mario and surpass him in terms of popularity. He didn't hold back, either - noting how he wants the blue blur's games and movies to be \"bigger\" than Mario, and for him to eventually have a USJ theme park attraction.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Not exactly the cream of the crop.\nFans of the farm sim genre have been eating well in recent times, thanks to a boom in enjoyable new releases and remakes. Heck, even Natsume's newest Harvest Moon is kind of good! Yet it was only a few years ago when Switch owners didn’t have anywhere near as many options, and it was in this period that My Time at Portia released. Offering up a jankier take on the Rune Factory approach of farm sims, it offered up a passable experience that nonetheless helped to fill an important gap in the broader library. Since that release, developer Pathea has been spending its time working on a sequel, My Time at Sandrock, which many were hoping would meaningfully improve on the flaws of the original. Unfortunately, it doesn’t really do so. My Time at Sandrock still offers up a reasonably enjoyable take on the farm sim formula, but its poor graphical presentation, litany of technical issues, and general lack of a distinct identity really drag it down.\nGameplay follows the expected trappings of a farm sim, wherein you slowly build up an impressive property via tending to crops and livestock, all while building relationships with various locals and participating in the occasional festival or gathering. Even in the desert, seasons change and you have to plan out how you time your planting and take care of your animals, even as new seasonal alternatives become available. It’s well-worn gameplay by this point, but it’s still fun to engage in. There’s something remarkably satisfying about diligently tending to your tasks every day and watching your equipment quality increase as your property gradually expands.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Good Form.\nAs much as we loved 2021's WarioWare: Get It Together!, it's definitely an entry in this barmy franchise that's ended up dividing opinion over time. With little in the way of truly engaging multiplayer options, no real core gimmick, or any significant attempt to utilise the Switch's unique control opportunities, some folks (not us, mind) felt that it didn't do enough to really make its mark. It's also been suggested that the game's large roster of characters, each with their own mechanics, ruined the simplicity at the heart of the fun, making for one too many decisions to be made before you got to the main meat of the microgames.\nNow, after waiting ages for Get It Together! to come along, just two years down the line we've got another brand new WarioWare adventure to dig into. WarioWare: Move It! makes some big shake-ups to its predecessor, wisely bringing back the motion-controlled madness of Smooth Moves and giving us more ways to engage with other players. This feels like the classic Wii experience reinvigorated, and a more fully fleshed-out entry than 2021's effort overall with regards to cooperative and multiplayer options.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Like when Sir Alex Ferguson oversaw his final game at Old Trafford, there’s a complicated atmosphere surrounding this year’s Football Manager. Football Manager 2024 is the last iterative game in the series before Project Dragonfly arrives next year, through which Sports Interactive plan the most radical overhaul of the game since the introduction of the 3D match engine in FM 09. This includes a complete rebuild of Football Manager in Unity, implementing brand new animation technology, and the inclusion of women’s football. But there is a reason why the studio has stuck with this tried and tested formula for so long. Big changes come with big risks, and as any Man Utd fan will know, those changes don’t always pay off.\r\n\n\r\nBut such concerns are for the future. FM24 is with us right now, and while it may be swapping the dugout for the stands ninety minutes from now, this isn’t some ceremonial exhibition match. It’s business as usual, and in mostly good ways. Sports Interactive have made meaningful changes to the management game both on and off the pitch, all built on top of fundamentals that remain as complex and compulsive as they have for years. That said, FM24 also demonstrates why a change is welcome, as in its current form it can struggle to strike the balance between authenticity and fun.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "While Rishi Sunak bundles nerds into Bletchley Park, we at the Electronic Wireless Show podcast are investigating the real danger of AI: somewhat rubbish text-to-speech voicelines making The Finals less fun. We discuss the arrival of AI voices in big-name games, the disappointingly businessy thinking behind it, and whether we can think up some uses for AI-generated material that we can actually get behind. All sparked by voice actor Gianni Matragrano’s video compilation of the lines in question, which you should probably watch before listening to this episode, or there’ll be a bit where Nate appears to bellow \"THE KING FISH\" for no reason. Well, maybe not no reason. It’s still Nate.\r\n\n\r\nPlus! We talk about what we’ve been playing this week, which coincidentally for me was The Finals, while Nate’s been digging deeper into the Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor demo. I also recount the teeth-based controversy surrounding Cities: Skyline 2, in turn begging the question: what are they going to do with all those teeth? \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I played a demo of Scene Investigators over the most recent Steam Next Fest, and was interested enough that I wanted to have a go with the full release. It's billed as a detective game for true crime fans, but it reminds me of those puzzle books you used to get, where you are shown an illustration of a crime scene and, if you stare at it long enough, can figure out the assigned solution. Scene Investigators is like that but the scene is a big 3D one you can walk around. A crime has happened and you need to figure out what, mostly by peering at the dates in a diary to cross reference them with the time and day a phone message was left. This is why I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. It's quite hard. But! Some people will really like it. \nRead more",

I hold its metal head in my hands, tilting it this way and that as I stare into its cold red eye. It offers no resistance to my pushes and pulls, as though I was a hairdresser directing a patron’s head. Based on Stanisław Lem’s 1964 novel of the same name, The Invincible’s Firewatch-like first-person adventure is intent on exploring how machines will come to shape humanity’s future. Over the course of its ten-hour story, where you step into the Soviet-styled space boots of biologist Yasna, you will take on her desperate search for the missing crew of her research ship, The Dragonfly, lost somewhere on the rocky, sandstorm-whipped world of Regis III.\nUsing a logbook filled with hand-drawn maps and scrawled notes, I’ve tracked Yasna’s crew to a makeshift game to the east of where they originally landed. Instead of humans, I find the lifeless robot. I want the android to give me answers, to tell me where my crew mates are, to explain what happened on Regis III, and why I can’t remember anything before I woke up in the desert with my possessions scattered around me.\nRead more",

          "description": "What kind of game does the label “survival horror” denote? Since its inconspicuous first appearance in the original Resident Evil’s loading screen (functioning first and foremost, lest we forget, as a handy marketing catchphrase), the term has been so enthusiastically embraced and haphazardly applied as to be rendered almost meaningless in 2023. Horror gaming has witnessed multiple seismic shifts since 1996, most notably the turn to action-oriented design with the likes of The Suffering and Resident Evil 4 in the mid-2000s, as well as the rise of spooky almost-walking-simulators like SOMA in the mid-2010s. \r\n\nYet the term survival horror has expanded to such a degree that it now seems to stand in, albeit rather awkwardly, for the entirety of video game horror. Even with the caveat that borders for these kinds of labels are notoriously hard to define, survival horror remains an unusually amorphous realm, one that (as a quick search of the relevant tag on Steam will reveal) lays claim as much to first-person bloodbaths like Zombie Army Trilogy as it does moody, combat-free adventures like Visage. Still, old distinctions linger, and a clutch of recent indie survival horrors qualify their work with the word “classic”. I interviewed some of the developers to find out why - and, more importantly, what classic survival horror means. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "It is perhaps ironic that in attempting to crystalise my thoughts about Alan Wake 2 - a game about a novelist with such crippling writer's block that they end up spawning an entire evil doppelganger of themselves to sabotage their own work - I, too, have been hopelessly staring at a blank screen for the better part of 24 hours. I have not, thank goodness, reached the stage where my psyche's split in two (yet), but this spiral of self-doubt has now got to the point where I simply have put words, any words, in front of one another to write my way out of this hellish pit of despair. \nAlan himself goes through a similar ordeal of writing to escape as he tries to find a way out of the prison-like dimension known as The Dark Place, where he's been trapped since the events of the first game - and I take heart from the fact that it's clearly well-worn territory for the folks at Remedy as well, such is the forensic precision in the way it's portrayed onscreen: a chaotic, supernatural tornado that not only threatens to unravel Alan's own identity, but also the wider world as we know it. It's imposter syndrome writ large, and honestly, Remedy are pretty on the money with this one. Horace is not a pretty taskmaster when the words stop coming.\nRead more",

          "description": "Thirsty Suitors is a dazzling new entry in a genre that is always badly in need of bolstering: turn-based RPGs without anime aesthetics and a story about something other than killing God. The game sees you play as Jala, who returns to her dilapidated hometown after getting dumped by the older woman for whom she abandoned college and her high school sweetheart. Waiting for her is a disappointed mother, a soon-to-be-wed sister who refuses to even speak to her, and a shadowy cabal formed of her spurned exes from the time in her life when rampant, unrelenting teen horniness nearly ripped the town apart. Jala’s journey to redemption and genuine adulthood will take her to the psychic plane to do cathartic (if overly simplistic) battle with her wronged exes, to the local skatepark to pull off some janky grinds, and to grounded emotional revelations that are rarely written this well in videogames.\nRead more",

It's a luminous, blue-green fluid that can be used as an energy source, a chemical catalyst and a supernatural healing agent. Each Amnesia game is broadly a story about the production of vitae, with some levels consisting of huge distillation and refining apparata, and major plot developments tied to what you do with it. In the original Amnesia: The Dark Descent, you'll brew potions using vitae in order to keep a decapitated head alive. In 2020's Amnesia: Rebirth, you'll use ornate metal cannisters of the stuff like batteries to power otherworldly machines. Vitae is the blood and breath of Amnesia, the grease upon the narrative axels, the fuel in its boiler, the miracle McGuffin that sustains its nastier flights of fantasy. But what is vitae, exactly?

I love HZD's Aloy, but does she ever just stream-of-consciousness her way through life.\nIn contrast, the nameless protagonist in Don't Nod's new climbing puzzle adventure (what even are genres?) is also silent. There are no other NPCs. You are climbing up through the ruins of an old civilisation. As such, Jusant relies on the devs having crafted an understandable world that you can barely interact with, aside from painstakingly climbing across it like a spidery archaeologist. You've got to have faith in your environmental storytelling if you're making a game like that. And Don't Nod have nailed it.\nRead more",

I know a little about the Yakuza series, having reviewed the 1980s-set Yakuza Zero for this very parish in 2018, and tried a bit of 2019's turn-based battler Yakuza: Like A Dragon. Fast-forward to 2023, and all Yakuza games are now Like A Dragon games, including the forthcoming Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, which is an... Animal Crossing game, actually? With skateboarding? I'm still getting my head around the existence of a zombie spin-off, Dead Souls, to say nothing of the samurai-era Like A Dragon: Ishin. And then there's the inter-quel Like a Dragon Gaiden, due this November, which seems like a relatively straight-laced delve into the past of original protagonist Kazuma Kiryu. Phew, it's just as well Ed Thorn wrote that guide to the order you should play the Yakuza games in.\r\n\n\r\nIt sounds like the developers at Ryu ga Gotoku Studio have a hard time keeping track themselves, especially given the rate at which Sega publish Like A Dragon games. According to studio director Masayoshi Yokoyama, Like A Dragon's creators feel a lot of pressure to get the games done quickly, not just with a view to making money but because as projects that riff so copiously on pop culture, Like A Dragon stories go out of date fast.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Lunacid sort of applies the perspective and medieval fantasy combat of that series to a story reminiscent of Demon's Souls - the From-alike that spurred the Japanese studio to international fame - with a world that has been flooded with toxic mist by a \"sleeping old one below\". Your job, as some unfortunate outcast chucked into a pit, is to journey downward and confront this mysterious creature, using any and all combinations of rapiers, clubs and fireballs.

          "description": "Back in June, when our Ed got a 30-minute hands-off glimpse of Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora, he had suspicions that Ubisoft's next big open world-athon was hiding some dark, terrible secret beneath the surface. It was almost too good, and too lovely-looking to be completely true, he proposed, and the brief tour of this rather enormous-looking game wasn't quite long enough to really dig beneath the surface to see if Ubisoft's lofty promises would hold up to closer scrutiny. \nNow, just over a month from release, I've finally been able to put it under a proper microscope, playing two hours of the thing from around the 25% mark of its campaign. And it really is as visually impressive as Ed suggested all those months ago. At long last, this is a game that looks and feels like an actual \"next-gen\" blockbuster (or as much as a game can, at least, when we're already several years into the current generation cycle). But Ed was also right to feel a wee bit suspicious of Frontiers Of Pandora. Perhaps not in the way he expected, but enough that I heard the same thing being muttered over and over again by almost everyone at the end of my preview session at Ubisoft's UK offices: \"I can't work out where the heck I'm meant to be going, or what I'm supposed to do.\" \nRead more",

I, of the RPS Treehouse, do truly love Starfield, and have only been quiet about it because admitting you enjoy The Grey Bethesda Game but couldn’t get into Baldur's Gate 3 or Elden Ring feels a bit like going to the Savoy Grill and only ordering chips. No one will ask you to leave, but they’ll probably start questioning your judgement.\nBut dammit, I like chips, and I like Starfield! I like its roving space captain fantasy, I like its utilitarian aesthetic, and I like how its click-clacking guns sound like extremely violent mechanical keyboards. Especially if I get to fire them at floating pirates, while I’m also floating, and said firing punts me upwards into a ceiling.\nRead more",

I'm not sure I'd be able to tell you. For whatever reason, the 3D character platformer has become an increasingly rare breed, it would seem, which makes them even more heartening to see when they do occasionally poke their head above the parapet and leap onto our screens. Song Of Nunu: A League Of Legends Story is one of them, channelling the joyous, boundless enthusiasm of its late 90s and early 00s predecessors to create a simple, but straightforward adventure that you could just as easily enjoy alone as an adult, or with a child in tow. It did not, alas, quite make me cry as developers Tequila Works intended (that honour still belongs to Rime and Rime alone out of their back catalogue), but there's much to admire here while having your heartstrings lightly plucked at the same time. And you don't need to know a jot about League Of Legends to enjoy it.\nRead more",

Released out of early access today, this is a top-down fantasy action-RPG set in a swirling, post-apocalyptic world in which you build up a town and sail between island dungeons in a sandship.\nThe sandship, or rather, \"grainwake\" sailing sees you bouncing merrily from dunes as vast, ominous structures loom out of the haze. The combat takes some inspiration from the Souls games, but the top-down perspective makes it feel like a classic arcade action title. Boss battles involve dodging or parrying colourful streaks, waves and clusters of projectiles. The developers, 12-person Chashu Entertainment, say it's a difficult experience. It looks it.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Alas, Remedy's horror-fuelled detective 'em up keeps its problem-solving a little too much at arm's length for my tastes. Every piece of evidence you collect has its own set place on the board, for example, and heck, even the thrill of joining the dots with a set of pins and string is taken away from you, as its deduction work is all swept up in a wave of automation. \nHappily, other developers are stepping in to fill that string-based gap, and chief among them is the French-made Chronique Des Silencieux, whose Steam demo I played over lunch today. You play as a rookie detective in this charming point and click game, and your entire raison d'etre is to point out contradictions Phoenix Wright-style between testimonies you gather and the evidence you accumulate. Only instead of shouting, \"Objection!\" you do it by manually sticking pins and red string between the offending bits of information. It's delightful, and well worth a nose if old Alan leaves you wanting this weekend. \nRead more",

Alan Wake 2 is much more enjoyable than Punch and Judy. And, like Remedyverse predecessor Control, there is something impressive about just how much visual tech you can choose to put on show: ray tracing, path tracing, Nvidia Ray Reconstruction, frame generation via DLSS 3, the lot.

What's the Golden Age of Piracy equivalent for \"vapourware\"? I'm picturing a spectral vessel like the Flying Dutchman, crewed by glum-faced producers and with a big grimacing statue of company CEO Yves Guillemot affixed to the prow.\r\n\n\r\nThe troubled naval combat sim isn't the only Ubisoft project experiencing misadventures. As revealed in their latest earnings report, the publisher have also pushed back a mysterious \"large game\", originally due to launch before the end of their current fiscal year, to the next fiscal year, which means at some point after 31st March 2024. Speculation runs rife that the anonymous blockbuster is Ubisoft Massive's Star Wars Outlaws.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "OK, so there's plenty in Worldless that won't remind you of Silksong or its predecessor, Hollow Knight. Rather than a medieval bug exploring a labyrinth of bioluminescent rot and lore, you're a vaguely humanoid cloud of shards and points, roaming an abstract landscape of soft curves and shafts of light. You're Rayman but fancy, basically, and the world is no world but an uncreated expanse of elemental forces, though you'll find you can run and jump on it much as you can the ledges of Hallownest. The combat is a different beast, too. Rather than Souls-inflected 2D hack-and-slash, it's turn-based battling with a twist - each turn gives you a countdown in which to perform real-time combos, mixing melee and magical attacks. \r\n\n\r\nSo why does Worldless make me think of Team Cherry's work? Partly it's the underlying touch of metroidvania, a word the press materials seem oddly hesitant to use. The map extends in all directions and you'll need to acquire new abilities to reach certain areas. Partly, it's the shared enchanted grotto atmosphere, with all sorts of tiny animate details festering for attention as you explore. And partly, it's the dash move you unlock early on, and the process of chaining it with a platform-conjuring ability to unlock routes while traversing them, which puts me strongly in mind of those horizontal gauntlet runs from the Silksong trailer. All told, if you're beginning to crisp up for lack of Hollow Knight news, you might want to give the demo a whirl ahead of Worldless's release on (drum roll) 21st November 2023.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Review code only came in late Sunday night, and for a game so heavily reliant on the thrust and resolution of its story, it's imperative I get to the end of it before I deliver my final verdict. Alas, the business of running a website does not play nicely with tight review deadlines like this, but what I can tell you after 15-odd hours of play is that it's really sunk its claws into me good and proper. \nAlan Wake 2 is a much creepier, more unnerving kind of horror game than its predecessor, doubling down on its fiction-meets-reality schtick while also piling on the scares and interlacing it with unsettling imagery of teeth-gnashing, inkblot-stained doppelgangers to ratchet up the tension. In many ways, this is a game that owes as much to Resident Evil 7 as it does its own lineage in the genre, and the dual narratives of its two protagonists, FBI agent Saga Anderson and Alan himself, arguably make this Remedy's most sophisticated tale yet. \nRead more",

          "description": "At EGX earlier this month, climate change protestors cosplaying as the Ghostbusters interrupted a Tekken 7 tournament, spraying player screens with orange paint and attempting to make a speech before being hauled off by security. The three protestors, who were later arrested, are members of Just Stop Oil, a British activist group officially founded in February 2022 who carry out acts of nonviolent obstruction and vandalism in the hope of rallying support against the UK government granting new fossil fuel licenses and production agreements. In the case of EGX, which is run by Rock Paper Shotgun's parent company Reedpop, Just Stop Oil were protesting against the sponsorship of one EGX stage by Barclays Bank, who have financed billions of dollars of fossil fuel investments (Barclays have provided some official comment down the page). They were also trying to call attention to oil giant Shell's sponsorship deal with Fortnite, which includes a special themed map \"powered by Shell V-Power(r) NiTRO+ Premium Gasoline\".\nI've written a bit here and there about the overlap between games, video games and protest movements. I've also been on a JSO protest march myself - albeit, slightly by accident (no, I didn't glue myself to anything). I was curious to hear more about the EGX protest, and specifically, whether the group's tactical use of cosplay for both dramatic effect and subterfuge represents any broader understanding of games as a form of protest art. JSO put me in touch with Oliver Clegg, a 20-year-old student who joined the group early on and has participated in some of their better-known direct actions. The below is a transcript of that conversation which has been edited down for length and clarity.\nRead more",

          "description": "It's hard to imagine blockblustery first-person shooting today without Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare's online progression systems, which - inasmuch as you can assign this much clout to a single game or developer - transformed the genre back in 2007 by reinventing multiplayer as a kind of RPG. Shooters without COD-style gear levelling ladders do exist, not least Counter-Strike 2, but most of the juggernauts depend on such fixtures, especially now that free-to-play service models have become the norm. So it's jarring to hear from Mackey McCandlish, one of Modern Warfare's original developers, that the old Infinity Ward team were split over the act of using XP to unlock guns, with some worrying it would be \"unfair\".\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "“Not everyone is Nintendo,” Hilmar Veigar Pétursson says. “Corporate entities, historically, are not very long-living. By being 30 years old, CCP is old by company standards.” As we talk, his fixation on persistence and artefact becomes clear. Though, he’s never hidden it. In 2014, Pétursson’s company, CCP, unveiled a five-metre-tall sculpture with the names of every active player in their MMO, EVE Online, etched into its surface; this year, they expanded the monument to add the names of players who have subscribed in the decade since. “I've been obsessed about doing things like printed books, magazines, models of EVE Online...,” Pétursson tells me, “like there's this need to leave a footprint.” \r\n\n\r\n\r\nPétursson has discovered a company that uses cow stem cells to 3D print calfskin. For the studio’s 30th anniversary, he plans to commission a poetry chapter inspired by Iceland’s epic history book, the Prose Edda, write it on the artificial skin, and put it in a Reykjavik museum. It would sit alongside an ancient calfskin copy of the Icelandic sagas. “It was written 1000 years ago, but as an Icelandic person, I can still read and understand what it says,” Pétursson explains. He tells me that it’s an effective way of storing data because if you sent a USB stick 1,000 years into the future, where would you even find a computer with a drive to read it? This appreciation for artefacts and need for legacy has led to his current project, a new game from CCP using blockchain technology, currently known as Project Awakening.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "There are quite a few here at Destructoid that are big into anime, so this is for them as well. For a limited time only, Twitch is offering viewers a free trial of Crunchyroll, the hit animation streaming service, for your viewing pleasure. \n\n\nAs outlined in a recent Twitch blog post, the Amazon-owned platform is providing a 60-day trial of Crunchyroll Mega Fan Premium membership. This means you'll get to watch all your favorite anime and manga shows without ads.\n\n\nImage via Twitch.\n\n\nOf course, it's not as simple as just holding out your hand and waiting for the trial to drop into it. There are a few provisos before you can qualify. Because of course there are.\n\n\n*Sigh* Okay, what do I have to do?\n\n\nFor starters, the campaign is only being run for this month, so you have until November 30 to get your free trial. In exchange for the Crunchyroll membership, you'll need to purchase \"two new Twitch subs and/or gift subs.\"\n\n\nThe type of Twitch subscriptions and gifted subs that are eligible include:\n\n\n\nNew monthly subs (any tier)\n\n\nMulti-month subs (3-month, 6-month)\n\n\nGift subs (any tier for any number of months)\n\n\n\nPrime subs, existing sub renewals, bits, turbos, and a bunch of others don't qualify.\n\n\nIt's also worth noting that it's only available on \"participating channels streaming in the Just Chatting, Art, and One Punch Man: World categories.\" You also can't qualify for the offer if you live in any of the following countries:\n\n\n\nRussia\n\n\nUkraine\n\n\nCuba\n\n\nChina\n\n\nIran\n\n\nJapan\n\n\nNorth Korea\n\n\nSyria\n\n\nSouth Sudan\n\n\nSudan\n\n\n\nWhat else? Oh, yeah: \"existing or past Crunchyroll members or users who have previously claimed a Crunchyroll free trial in the past year are not eligible.\"\n\n\nI think that covers everything. As is typical with these types of deals, there are plenty of Ts & Cs before you qualify. If you do quality, happy days. If not... Young Sheldon, I guess.\n\nThe post Twitch is giving out Crunchyroll trials, in exchange for some subs appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Amidst all the remakes that are crowding the current gaming market, Skyblivion is definitely one to look out for. While there's still some time until we can expect a proper release date, the team behind the ambitious Oblivion remake has released a hair-raising video update.\n\n\nOver on YouTube, the unofficial fan remake of TES4 lets its cape down to bring a more sinister vibe in promoting Skyblivion. The video showcases some of the darker and scarier elements of this Oblivion reimagining.\n\n\n\n\nAmong other things, we get a glimpse of some areas that have been given a new spit shine in Skyrim's engine, including Hackdirt and Arkved’s Tower. We also get a look at some new monsters that have been made specifically for this project. There's even a quest walkthrough, as well.\n\n\nWhen is it coming out?\n\n\nAt the moment, there's no definite release window for Skyblivion yet, outside a likely 2025 launch. It is, after all, quite the undertaking, completely reimagining Oblivion in Skyrim's engine. Volunteers are always welcome as well, if you do want to lend a hand.\n\n\nWe've seen in the past that the remake is coming along nicely, and with each update we get, we move closer to the project becoming available.\n\n\nHaving started back in 2012, the fan remake has been in development for over 13 years at this point. However, it's looking more and more like it's going to be worth it in the end. You'll also be pleased to know that it'll be completely free, providing you have legitimate copies of Oblivion and Skyrim (natch).\n\nThe post Oblivion fan remake Skyblivion shows off new, spooky footage appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Larian Studios has pushed through a massive Patch 4 to Baldur’s Gate 3, applying over 1000 fixes, tweaks and changes. Accessibility is a major focus of this patch, in addition to other fixes applied to the hirelings system, combat, and UI.\n\n\nTo start, the team has implemented a setting that allows color-blind players to choose between protanopia, deuteranopia, or tritanopia, which applies to character outlines, circles, character map markers, frame portraits in turn order, and party portraits. For those unfamiliar, protanopia and deuteranopia corresponds to red-green color vision deficiency, while tritanopia is blue-yellow.\n\n\nIn addition, the appearance of hirelings can now be customized when recruiting them. Also, dead avatars can be sent to Withers’ Wardrobe of Wayward Friends, and the enigmatic skeleton will explain how the feature works for those who are unfamiliar.\n\n\nIn terms of gameplay, several autosaves have been added to the Shadowlands, Wyrm’s Crossing, and the Lower City, including at the Steel Watch Foundry, the Iron Throne, and Rivington. There is now an option to make the ‘end turn’ button need to be held rather than tapped, for those of us who needed that.\n\n\nI think one of the fixes I’m the least happy about is in the fight with a certain boss in Act 3. It’d seem you can no longer push him into a chasm, because apparently logic kicks in and he remembers he has a natural defense to sudden gravitational shifts.\n\n\nAlso, one of the most important things in Act 3 has been corrected — Yenna now returns to camp after the avatar of Bhaal kidnaps one of your friends instead of inexplicably disappearing. I always wondered about where she went, but it made such a minimal impact on my campaign that I just shrugged it off.\n\n\nTo read up on every single change made in Baldur’s Gate 3’s Patch 4, click here. \n\nThe post Baldur’s Gate 3 Patch 4 is live, with accessibility and hireling updates appeared first on Destructoid.",

Surprisingly, this came out before an anticipated fan translation of the original PS1 game.\n\n\nPreviously, Boku no Natsuyasumi 2 was only released in Japan on PS2 (later ported to PSP). For that matter, the entire series never really left Japan. Part of the sudden rush is due to more Western awareness of the titles, especially in the wake of Action Button’s six-hour review on the title. It’s really hard to write that out without adding an expletive. Let’s just say I don’t have the attention span to watch it.\n\n\nI also often joke that, because Boku no Natsuyasumi is popular, I probably wouldn’t like it.

Although the sign isn’t super flashy or extravagant, it still looks crisp and welcoming for future fans to admire while paying a visit to the historical site.\n\n\nDuring a Direct in September, the gaming giant teased fans with the museum. In the Instagram post that Nintendo Japan posted on October 26, the sign and logo can be seen from a number of different perspectives, showing off the sign from different times of the day.\n\n\nCurrently, the museum is under construction in Uji City, Kyoto Prefecture, near Kyoto, Japan. The renovations and construction work are set to be completed in March 2024. The sole purpose of the long-awaited project is to provide fans with a glimpse of the company’s legacy, history, and highlights through a well-laid-out collection of its past.\n\n\nHistory of the Nintendo Museum Site\n\n\nImage via Nintendo\n\n\nBack in 2021, Nintendo announced the renovation of one of their old facilities, its Uji Ogura Plant. First built in 1969, the plant’s original purpose was to produce playing cards and Hanafuda cards. Later on, the plant became a customer service hub, for the company’s products to be repaired. \n\n\nThe renovations announced include both the plant and the land surrounding it. Originally, this project was planned to be called the Nintendo Gallery with a similar concept and approach to its current museum idea.\n\n\nWe'll hopefully see more than just a sign in the months to come, leading up to the Nintendo Museum's opening.\n\nThe post The Nintendo Museum’s sign and logo have been revealed appeared first on Destructoid.",

Fantastic Pixel Castle appears to be a first-party studio that is being fully-funded by NetEase, who has been ramping up their investment in MMO  companies recently. According to Street, Fantastic Pixel Castle is already working on an epic AAA MMORPG codenamed Ghost.\n\n\n\n\nA studio full of veterans\n\n\nLooking over the \"Our Team\" section on the Fantastic Pixel Castle website, it looks like the studio already has a ton of talent. Studio Head and Game Director Greg Street himself has worked on World of Warcraft, Age of Empires, League of Legends, and the highly anticipated Riot Games MMO.\n\n\nAnother World of Warcraft is Brian Holinka who served as Lead Combat Designer on WoW for over a decade.\n\n\nOther industry veterans listed include Bart Tiongson, Candace Thomas, David Kubalak, Ed Altorfer, Graham Berger, and more. Overall it looks like a very talented team at Fantastic Pixel Castle, so I'm excited to see what they are working on.\n\n\nCodename Ghost\n\n\nDetails on the in-development MMO codenamed Ghost are sparse, but Street and the team have a stream planned for November 8 at 2 p.m. ET to reveal more details on the project. According to Street the MMO is very early in development, so fans should not expect any sort of gameplay footage, but rather more details about systems and design philosophy.\n\n\nIn Ghost, players will travel to world shards to power up their characters, bring back resources, and build their own civilization. In turn, the city will grow and evolve based on choices and actions of the players across seasons.\n\n\nBased on a section on the website, Ghost will originally launch on PC, with the goal to ship on consoles at a later date. The team also plans to ship their game globally and localize it into many languages.\n\nThe post Greg “Ghostcrawler” Street announces new games studio and MMORPG appeared first on Destructoid.",

But wait, it gets stranger.\n\n\nGoing back to the beginning, Dandy was developed by John Howard Palevich. It’s a dungeon crawler inspired by Dungeons & Dragons. In fact, the name is based on the abbreviation D&D. Dandy plays like a prototype of the popular arcade Gauntlet, and that’s because it basically is.

For those who wish to download it, you'll have until November 6.

Yet despite only featuring a few small tweaks to the original game, what I played was remarkably fresh, even by modern standards.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nJust the way you remember\n\n\nFrom the first moments of the game, I felt an overwhelming wave of nostalgia wash over me.

          "description": "Years into development, there's still no sign of when Skywind will see the light of day. However, the team behind the fan remake of Morrowind has shared what was technically a Halloween teaser.\n\n\nShowing the spookier side of this unofficial project, we get another glimpse of Skywind in its current state (thanks, DSO Gaming). Here we have a small taste of some of the more unsettling creatures that will await us, as and when it comes out.\n\n\n\n\nAs for a release date, we still don't have one. We've been treated to gameplay footage in the past, but there's no sign of the \"total conversion mod\" being made available just yet. For now, enjoy the spooks in the teaser. Admittedly two days after Halloween, but that's my bad for not spotting it sooner.\n\n\nA quick reminder of what the project is\n\n\nSkywind is a complete reimagining of The Elder Scrolls 3 which is being built in Bethesda's Creation Engine. In this sense, it's actually more of a Skyrim mod than a Morrowind remake, but the end result is pretty much the same thing.\n\n\nThe team has been working on it for quite some time. In fact, it's difficult to even pinpoint when the project officially began, but the FAQ says it's about as old as TES5.\n\n\nIt's probably best to also point out that while this sounds very much like Skyblivion – the unofficial remake of Oblivion done in Skyrim – the two are being helmed by different teams. If you're interested in helping out the Skyrind crew, they're always on the lookout for volunteers.\n\nThe post Skywind, the unofficial remake of Morrowind, releases new teaser appeared first on Destructoid.",

The company stated on X (Twitter), \"This update will feature Nvidia DLSS support with frame generation, display and HDR controls for supported systems, and other optimizations and improvements.\"\n\n\nSince the update is going into Steam Beta, it means while publicly available, it's not officially out yet. Bethesda even calls for users to leave feedback so it can be polished before the full release.\n\n\nPlayers have had access to DLSS via mods since launch, but it's nice the RPG will have official implementation. Bethesda has been progressively implementing player-requested features like a FOV slider and better Intel ARC support. DLSS just so happens to be the latest one receiving official support. \n\n\nThe beta doesn't have a specific date, but its release next week means testers won't have long to wait. Hopefully, Bethesda will share more specific details about this update when it does roll out. \n\n\nFor fans who would rather not use Steam Beta or have Starfield on the Microsoft store, Nukem's DLSS mod seamlessly integrated it into the RPG. \n\nThe post Starfield Nvidia DLSS support goes into Steam Beta next week appeared first on Destructoid.",

According to Soso, most missions are boring fetch quests and there's no variation in how you can approach problems.

Devil Jin’s appearance matches his name, and his fighting skills are beyond human capabilities.\n\n\nThe “Mystic Stargazer” Zafina brings back her unique fight style rooted in her warrior heritage and her spiritual abilities as a mystical astrologist. Her methods are as old as her lineage, using Ancient Assassination Arts in her attacks.\n\n\nLee Chaolan fights with Martial Arts, but his true power comes from the Violet Suit, a one-of-a-kind battle suit that uses sophisticated technology and unleashes attacks that reflect his “Silver haired-Demon” persona.\n\n\nAlisa Bosconovitch is the “Destroying Automaton” developed by the brilliant scientist Dr. Bosconovitch.

Later this month, Obsidian Entertainment will introduce the Playgrounds mode — a creation toolset that enables players to create within the world of Grounded.\n\n\nThe new Playgrounds mode was introduced via the Xbox Wire today. It's a creation suite that can be compared to Halo's Forge mode or Forza Horizon 5's EventLab. \n\n\n\n\nGame director Adam Brennecke said that \"this feature has been on the backlog for a very long time.\" The idea for Grounded's Playgrounds stems from the ingenuity of the modding community. The Grounded development team at Obsidian is relatively small, so instead of directing resources towards new content, Brennecke and the team decide to craft the Make It and Break It set of building tools that enables the game community's imagination to run wild. \n\n\nBrennecke says that the Make It and Break It is impressively malleable. Essentially everything in the game is at your disposal creatively. \"We’re going to provide the tools, and someone’s going to make something magical,\" he said.\n\n\nPlayers can build buildings, place furniture, create obstacles, implement creatures, and of course, larger bosses. You'll even have the ability to install specific sounds and music into specific locations and scenarios. The vast majority of Grounded's campaign assets can be utilized for creativity. It's extremely customizable, \"down to individual blades of grass.\"\n\n\nThe new Make It and Break It free update will roll out for Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on November 13. In addition to Playgrounds, the update will also consist of new challenges for Burgle quests, fresh base-building assets, and combat adjustments.\n\n\nGrounded is available via Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass. See what other big titles are headed to the subscription service soon right here.\n\nThe post Grounded gets its own Forge with Make It and Break It update this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

According to the press release, the delay was put in place to \"allow for additional fine-tuning.\" Cygames apologized to fans who were looking forward to diving in at the tail end of November.

In addition to cross-platform multiplayer, the open beta will offer up access to the Grand Bruise Legends! party mode.

Specifically, it mentions \"mods that are not officially supported by the game.\"\n\n\nDoesn't necessarily say Capcom will be cracking down on them\n\n\nThe video goes on to say that unofficial content is \"impossible to distinguish from cheat tools,\" though it concedes that the majority of mods \"can have a positive impact on the game.\"\n\n\nHowever, Capcom outlines some concerns about modding, such as \"reputational damage\" or mods that are \"offensive to public order and morals.\" On top of this, there's the potential for games to become corrupt or damaged which can add to workload for customer support teams.\n\n\nWhat this means going forward isn't clear. The presentation strongly implies that Capcom's R&D department is not 100% in favor of unofficial content for games. While there's no indication the developer is looking to clamp down on mods, it seems clear that the video is concerned about how cheats (or mods) may harm a company's reputation.\n\nThe post Capcom wary of ‘reputational damage’ from mods, equating them to cheats appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Things are heating up in the mobile gaming world. While the Steam Deck has inevitably kicked things off in this market, there have been a number of rivals already. And now Lenovo has just launched its Legion Go device, which could blow Valve's efforts out the water.\n\n\nWe knew the Lenovo handheld was coming on Halloween, but boy did those weeks fly by! Promising PC gaming on the move, with a QHD+ display screen, detachable controllers, all working through Windows 11, the Legion Go may make the Deck poop itself.\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, you can see a side-by-side comparison of the specs over on Videocardz. The Legion device is powered by AMD Zen4 and RDNA tech, while the Valve machine is using Zen2 and RDNA 2, so the latter is already starting to trail behind.\n\n\nThe Steam Deck may want to up its game\n\n\nWhile there's nothing wrong with the Steam Deck, we can already see the advances that have been made in mobile gaming in less than two years. The fact that Legion Go has a 1TB variant and a slightly better battery life will probably be appealing to some.\n\n\nHowever, with that extra juice comes the price tag. Over on the Lenovo website itself, the 512GB model is currently selling for $699.99, while more storage will set you back an extra $50.\n\n\nGiven that we might not see a new Steam Deck for a couple more years, there may be a bit of danger for Gabe Newell and his team. No doubt Valve will have something up its sleeve, but in quite a short amount of time, we've seen a number of gaming handhelds try to muscle in on the Deck's territory.\n\nThe post Steam Deck rival Lenovo Legion Go is out now appeared first on Destructoid.",

Announced via X (Twitter) and YouTube, SEGA and Hardlight's Sonic Dream Team will launch exclusively on Apple Arcade on December 5th.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to a post via Apple, Sonic Dream Team is a new 3D action platformer that follows Sonic and the gang as they stop Doctor Eggman. This time, he has discovered a dream manifestation device called The Reverie. As Sonic or a host of playable friends, folks will navigate insane dreamscapes, rescue allies, and avoid Eggman's goal of world domination. \n\n\nDream Weaver\n\n\nScreenshot via Sonic the Hedgehog YouTube\n\n\nDespite the title being exclusive to Apple Arcade, Sonic Dream Team looks to be pretty fleshed out. We have our usual Tails, Amy, and Knuckles, but we also get Rouge the Bat and Cream the Rabbit (alongside Cheese the Chao). This will be Cream's first playable appearance in a main game since 2019's Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020. \n\n\nAs for gameplay, it looks pretty similar to Sonic Lost World, with players being able to navigate stages freely in 3D. However, it also looks to be open world to a degree, though how vast the world may be has yet to be seen. Boss battles are also present, as we see Sonic fight a giant enemy crab (not that one) and Tails battle a laser-shooting robot. Regardless, the worlds look vibrant and fun, which is typical for a series such as Sonic the Hedgehog.\n\n\nA new animation is also shown in the trailer, sporting some impressive visuals. The studio that created the animation is Powerhouse Animation Studios. They have previously animated for the Sonic Frontiers Prologue: Divergence short and the cinematics for Sonic Origins. Outside of Sonic, Powerhouse is responsible for the Castlevania animated shows, most recently Castlevania: Nocturne. \n\n\nSonic Dream Team launches on Apple Arcade on December 5.\n\nThe post Sonic Dream Team, a new 3D Sonic, announced for Apple Arcade appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Get ready for a deep dive into the unknown, because the 1992 NEC PC-9801 visual novel, Dead of the Brain has received a fan translation.\n\n\nSo, backing up, the PC-98 is the last of a line of NEC computers released through the ‘80s and into the ‘90s in Japan. I could get more technical about it, but basically, these computers provided dedicated ecosystems to games, and they largely remained in Japan, where they were popular. This means that there’s an entire beloved subset of games that most Westerners were locked out of. Even among the more informed retro gamers, the games remained obscure, but awareness of them has been growing. Within the indie market, games like Stonks 9800 and World of Horror have even coopted their aesthetic (PC-98 and PC-88, respectively).\n\n\nImage via Romhacking\n\n\nAnyway, Dead of the Brain was the first in the “Nightmare Collection” which wound up consisting of three games. It’s a point-and-click adventure game mixed with heavy visual novel elements. What makes it stand apart is its extremely gory presentation. In fact, I don’t even know what else to say about it, other than the fact that it’s very gory as well as some potential nudity – but not the fun kind.\n\n\nDead of the Brain was also released on the PC-Engine (TurboGrafx-16), MSX, FM Towns, and Sharp X68000.\n\n\nNonetheless, with the growing popularity of NEC’s PC lineup in the West, it’s the perfect time to get a fan translation. The crew behind it state that this translation was made from the ground up and is not related to the PC-Engine or Retronomicon PC-98 translations.\n\n\nIf you’re interested, you can obtain the Dead of the Brain fan translation patch over here.\n\nThe post Gory PC-98 adventure game Dead of the Brain gets a new fan translation appeared first on Destructoid.",

Sometimes Yoshi showed up in The Legend of Zelda, and Kirby was whatever color he felt like at the moment, be it gray or pink. In 1996, that laissez-faire attitude was in full effect for the release of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars for the Super Nintendo.

It will be released as a hardcover graphic novel on April 30, 2024, in retail stores and online, for $19.99 (and it hits comic book stores on May 1, 2024). Mathieu Gabella is the author, with art from Paolo Traisci. \nThe Hidden Codex follows Edward, a scribe and reluctant monk after he escapes from a kidnapping performed by a clan of Vikings. After securing his freedom, Edward finds his brother missing and strange documents \"blackened by a language he innately understands.\" \n\"No one knows where these occult-looking symbols came from, but Edward has seen such writings before: in the workshop of an enigmatic wise man among the Vikings who is part of a secret order: Those Unseen,\" a press release reads. \"An order that could offer answers to Edward, and guarantee his aspirations of freedom and knowledge. But with that knowledge, can he find and rescue his own brother before it's too late?\"\nUbisoft senior transmedia content manager Etienne Bouvier says the company is lucky to work with Gabella and Traisci as they are two long-standing fans of the Assassin's Creed franchise who infused their love of it, and knowledge of its lore, into this book. \nAssassin's Creed Valhalla: The Hidden Codex hits bookshelves and online retailers on April 30, 2024, before it hits comic book stores on May 1.

Set in a Canadian ski resort, it comes in three variants: long track, short track, and tri-oval. New Master License events are coming and the update also adds quality-of-life features, such as a dashboard that tracks player progression.\nOf course, new vehicles are always exciting, and here are the seven joining the roster:\nDodge Charger R/T 426 Hemi '68\nDodge Challenger SRT Demon '18\nLexus LFA '10\nMercedes-Benz 190 E 2.5-16 Evolution II '91\nNISMO 400R '95\nPorsche 911 GT3 RS (992) '22\nTesla Model 3 Performance '23\nSpec II adds a host of smaller additions, such as new Cafe menus and new photo mode options, and you can read a complete breakdown by reading the blog post on the Gran Turismo website.

As for why, IGN's sources report that during an employee meeting after the layoffs, Bungie CEO Pete Parsons told staff that the layoffs were due to the underperformance of Destiny 2 over the last year as well as \"lower-than-expected preorders\" for the upcoming expansion, The Final Shape. \nEmployees were reportedly told that Destiny 2 player sentiment had reached an all-time-low and IGN's sources say employees at the studio have attempted to discuss this with Bungie leadership, asking to make the necessary changes, presumably to get player sentiment back up. \nBloomberg reports that roughly 8…",

Now, Square Enix has released a new teaser trailer for Missing-Link alongside the reveal it will launch sometime next year. \nIn the teaser trailer, we see someone who is presumably the game's protagonist in Scala ad Caelum, a special metropolis that those who have completed Kingdom Hearts III will recognize. The teaser showcases the RPG's combat as well, which seems like a mix between some of the mechanics in Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories and standard mobile action RPG gameplay. We also see some of the Disney characters in the game, including Ariel from The Little Mermaid, Simba from The Lion King, and Baymax from Big Hero 6, to name a few. \nCheck out the Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link teaser trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nSquare Enix says it is now recruiting testers from the U.K. and Australia for a closed Missing-Link beta test, and if eligible, you can apply here.\nKingdom Hearts Missing-Link is due out on iOS and Android in 2024. \nFor more, watch the original Missing-Link reveal trailer and then watch the Kingdom Hearts IV reveal trailer.

In an interview with Kinda Funny, Spider-Man 2 director Bryan Intihar confirmed the answer is yes\nWhen host Greg Miller asked if it had been previously confirmed or denied whether or not their spin on Wolverine shared the same Earth as its Spider-Men, Intihar replied by saying, “They’re all 1048. I think I got that right, but yeah.” Inthiar is referring to Earth-1048, which is the designation for the Marvel universe Insonmiac’s superhero games occupy.\nYou can watch the clip beginning at the 1:10:44 mark (thanks IGN). \n\n\nWhether or not that means we’ll see any Spider-Man references in Wolverine, which does not have a release window, remains to be seen, but that’s exciting news regardless. Marvel’s Spider-Man’s New York City is chock full of references to other heroes, such as Avengers Tower, the Sanctum Sanctorum, and the Wakandan Embassy, so it made more sense to imagine Logan doing his thing somewhere out there.\nBeyond this update, we know little about Wolverine other than that it will be a mature-rated title exclusive to the PlayStation 5.

Like the previous games, this third outing looks every bit as moody and unsettling. \nThis pre-alpha footage shows playable characters, Low and Alone, exploring The Necropolis, a desert-like zone, working together to overcome its many obstacles. For example, when attacked by flying beetles, one shoots them down with a bow while the other smashes the downed targets with a wrench. The kids’ biggest threat, at least in this slice, comes in the form of a giant, rampaging doll aptly known as \"Monster Baby\". It’s supremely creepy, and you can see for yourself below.\n\n\nUnlike the first two games, which were developed by Tarsier Studios, Little Nightmares III is being made by Supermassive Games, makers of Until Dawn and The Dark Pictures Anthology.

But since the long-awaited sequel has been tossed around for over a decade, it's fair to assume not everyone has a clear memory of the events of the first game, and some people likely never got around to playing it at all. If that sounds like you, you're in the right place; here's everything you need to know about the first Alan Wake to prepare for the sequel.\nArriving at Bright Falls\nThe game takes place in the town of Bright Falls, Washington, where the titular protagonist Alan Wake is going on vacation with his wife, Alice. Wake is an author known for his Alex Casey novels, but he hasn't written anything new in three years.

While we loved the game – read Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 here – once players got their hands on the game, some encountered a few bugs and issues, like one where their character model became a small white cube that looks like tofu. Plus, players discovered a Cuban flag was displayed inside and outside the Morales household rather than the expected Puerto Rican flag. A new update for Marvel's Spider-Man 2 out today fixes both of these issues and more. \n\n\nVersion 1.001.003 is now live in-game, and it brings a few fixes to the game, including the aforementioned flag issue and white cube issue. It also addresses an issue where The Amazing 2 Suit's spider logo appeared too bright in-game, and improves the game's stability. Here's the full update breakdown: \nAddressed an issue where an incorrect flag was displayed\nAddressed an issue where models would not load properly after long play sessions\nAddressed an issue where The Amazing 2 Suit's Spider logo appeared too bright\nImproved stability\nDeveloper Insomniac Games has also released a statement alongside the above patch notes specifically addressing the flag issue. \n\"Today's patch corrects an error where the Cuban flag was incorrectly displayed instead of the Puerto Rican flag,\" it reads. \"We understand that accurate representation matters, and greatly regret this error. We sincerely apologize and will do better in the future.\" \n\n\nMarvel's Spider-Man 2 hit PlayStation 5 exclusively on October 20. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 review and then read about how Insomniac updated New York City for the sequel.

Arenas, which are based on recognizable real-world locations, are fully destructible and can be altered by players.\nThe open beta adds the new Skyway Stadium to the map rotation. The beta also introduces a new game mode called Bank-It, in which four teams of three fight to gather coins, with the winner either hitting a max limit first or having the most cash banked at the end of the round. \n\n\nPlayers will have access to 20 weapons, 26 gadgets, and 9 abilities used to reduce targets into showers of gold coins. Item progression will feature 5 Mastery Levels per weapon as well. \nThe open beta is cross-platform, so players on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam can jump in. It will run until November 5. The beta includes a free battle pass with 16 exclusive, permanent rewards that carry over to the game’s eventual full launch.",

          "description": "Today's Xbox Partner Preview brought us a new look at Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, the remake announced earlier this year. In the trailer, we get a first look at the game's use of Unreal Engine 5 alongside some quick snippets of tactical espionage action.\nWhile what's shown is definitely gameplay, it doesn't appear to be final as the trailer calls it the \"first in-engine look.\" Plus, the gameplay is watermarked with a \"pre-alpha footage\" tag.\nCheck out the Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, we see Big Boss sneaking through jungles, over wooden bridges, through World War 2-esque trenches, and more. There's nothing pointing toward the game's story in this trailer but it does make one thing clear: this remake is going to be beautiful if today's showing is any indication. And the gameplay looks solid and intact – exactly what you'd imagine a 2023 remake of this 2004 classic would look like. \nRevealed back in May, coincidentally during a PlayStation Showcase, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a from-the-ground-up remake of the third Metal Gear Solid game originally released in 2004. Like the original, this remake is a 1960s-era prequel to the Metal Gear series that tells the origin story of Big Boss. As such, it serves as a foundational narrative to the wider Metal Gear universe. \nHere are a few screenshots from today's showing: \n\nFor more Metal Gear, check out Game Informer's Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1 PlayStation 5 New Gameplay Today. \nAre you excited for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater?

A strange, alien-like tentacled form reaches up from beneath the roiling ocean waters – seemingly the source of the oil rig’s trouble. As the protagonist navigates the catwalks and beams of the rig, we hear distant and troubling screams. After traversing several tunnels, the first-person lead drops through a hatch into the very water that seems to be the source of the strange tendrils.\nThe Chinese Room is clearly interested in building atmosphere and tension in this trailer and, presumably, doing the same in the broader game. There’s clearly some awful threat at play aboard the rig, but its nature and what is happening to the others on board the rig remain a mystery.\nNonetheless, the first-person visuals and tense exploration are looking great, leaving us excited for the game’s launch on Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass) in early 2024.",
