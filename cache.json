It sounds too much like Rita from down the chip shop, who might ask if you want salt and vinegar with that; or Rita from round the corner, who may or may not be a juvenile delinquent wearing altogether too much makeup. That said, Rita, the witch-like antagonist of the Power Rangers team, definitely doesn’t work in the chip shop. Too much makeup on the other hand…\nPower Rangers: Rita’s Rewind is a brand new belt-scrolling beat 'em up from Digital Eclipse, a developer better known for their retro remasters and collections in the form of Atari 50 and the recent Tetris Forever. Based on the original '90s incarnation of the show — a Japanese-American co-production that mish-mashed Japan’s Super Sentai action scenes with US-filmed actors — Power Rangers is a logical candidate to join the 2D scrolling beat-'em-up renaissance.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Lit by gaslamps that can’t quite dispel the industrial haze, they pass for a civilian - a rough one, admittedly, but not shady enough to cause an itch in the swordarm of any passing guard.\nUntil, that is, they take to the thieves’ highway - following the trajectory of their grappling hook upward to the rooftops, from which they can see the shape of the city, and the moon beyond. Up here, it’s a parallel world - the trees on street level answered by chimney stacks, and the distant hills echoed by the rise and fall of steep gables. “We’re super proud of these rooftops,” says Greg LoPiccolo. “It’s an amazing landscape that we put a lot of thought and effort into, and it’s a lot of fun to traverse.”\nBack in 1998, LoPiccolo was the game director who saw Thief: The Dark Project to completion. Today - after an 18 year detour to Harmonix to lead projects like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, among other adventures - he’s the game director of Thick as Thieves. “It really is an opportunity to do something unique and cool and new, on the shoulders of this stuff that is now well-respected,” he says. “Thief has some legs, right? People still talk about it to some degree.”\nRead more",

Success lies in picking off Spider-Man or Squirrel Girl or Marcus Fenix so as they wait to respawn, you hop on the big area that needs capturing. Or you push the cart while tanky Hulk absorbs bullets with his biceps and John Marvel snipes from afar.\nThe more I played Rivals, though, the more it hit me that it's specifically a messier, more complex Overwatch. A hero shooter with a surprising amount of polish and charm, sure, but also one that slides off my brain like water off Birdman's back. I understand why it's supremely popular at the moment and yet, I really don't.\nRead more",

I’ve engineered a Bloodsucker attack that wiped out the worst of villains – someone who was mean to me – and I’ve progressed far enough to really open up the map, and with it, access to more of the Zone’s fiercest fleshwarps.\nAlso, rats. Buoyed by the successful Bloodsucker siccing, I’m back on the trail of some mysterious anomaly scanners, and word is I might find a lead inside a local maze of wrecked cars. It’s heavily guarded by some gangster types, but for once, I won’t have to dash off in search of some far-off muties and coax them back here using my neck as bait. Mercifully, a gaggle of overgrown rodents are already hopping around right outside the labyrinth’s entrance. I beckon them in like a bouncer on his last day, then sprint past the stunned gunmen, who can barely shoulder their rifles before being set upon by a pack of giant carnivorous hamsters.\nRead more",

          "description": "In more ways than one, today’s Total War: Warhammer 3 expansion marks a milestone for game director Rich Aldridge and his team at Creative Assembly. Omens Of Destruction’s three headline legendary lords each bring new campaigns and units for their respective factions, but it’s the fourth lord - a Khorne champion free to all players - that I imagine Aldridge will end up remembering the most fondly.\nWhen Total War: Warhammer released back in 2016, it shipped with eight legendary lords - famous characters from Games Workshop’s fantasy setting that here act as faction leaders. The number grew steadily and, in terms of announcement order at least, today’s addition of Arbaal The Undefeated marks the series’ 100th. That's a hundred campaigns, a hundred joint efforts of game design, animation, art, writing and voice work.\nAldridge has never been shy about the team’s ambition for the series to eventually offer up each unit from every Fantasy Battle 6th edition army book (\"The goal is to do everything, right?\"). But ambition is one thing, and considering the fraught conditions at Creative Assembly and parent company Sega over the past few years, it’s not just the addition of the 100th lord that feels like something to celebrate. It’s taken time, effort, and a siesmic shift in update frequency, but Total War: Warhammer III is in the best place it's ever been.\nRead more",

It seems to play a bit like XCOM, with an oppressive world map that is slowly encroached upon as you travel around recruiting soldiers, interacting with settlements, and picking real-time fights with hellfiends \"inspired by biblical descriptions and European folklore\".

Update 2.2 went live yesterday, bringing with it a host of fixes, as well as some deeper customisation options for both your character and vehicles. The base game is also 55% off on Steam until the 18th of December, with the Phantom Liberty expansion at 20% off, or both in a 48% off bundle.

All those other games, with their decisive action, systemic consequence, and neck-snapping: I was playing those to relax, too. Why else would I have snapped all those necks? Being shorn of base pleasures does not make Naiad a restorative oasis amid a desert of stressful video games, and it doesn't make it more relaxing than its peers.

I think there are three reasons for this enthusiasm: 1) it's free-to-play with the usual comet's tail of microtransactables 2) it's third-person Overwatch with Marvel characters, a straightforwardly enticing licensing sandwich, and 3) people want to have sex with a larger-than-usual proportion of the cast and especially awful tongue-monster Venom, who has a good butt in this one. No, I'm not going to share pictures. You'll have to google that filth yourself.\r\n\n\r\nBut perhaps you are a sophisticated soul who has no time for such salacious nonsense. You're more interested in hearing how they're patching the thing. Enough with the butts already, dang it - this is a new multiplayer game so there must, of course, be patches!

It's like offering to shake hands while wearing one of those comedy hand buzzers - except that the hand buzzer is an intricate simulation of zero-G physics, missile behaviours and comms jamming, featuring spacecraft with proper internal layouts that require you to think hard about attitude control if you don't want, say, your engines to become Swiss cheese about 90 seconds before you need to retreat from combat. \r\n\n\r\nBeing a \"true\" 3D real-time space strategy game, Nebulous looks and sounds a lot like Homeworld on the surface, but it's nothing like as straightforward. It is systems within systems. It is a game in which you can, theoretically, plot the path of a single guided munition through an asteroid field, so as to catch an enemy cruiser in the back. I barely understand how to make a ship fire on another ship, using plain old armour-piercing shells, and now they're threatening to add carriers, fighters and bombers. Customisable ones!

          "description": "If we follow Marshall McLuhan’s ideas about technology being an extension of the body, then the copy and paste keyboard shortcuts are my equivalent of a trip to one of Cyberpunk 2077’s ripperdocs. In the writing of this single article, I will use them for links, HTML code, and other ephemera. I even copied McLuhan’s name across from a different tab, which I’m sure he’d appreciate/be horrified by. I love those shortcuts. I need them. They are the wind beneath my wings, and the crud buildup beneath the bottom left of my keyboard.\nI cannot say how the first tailor to gaze upon a sewing machine felt, nor the first egg-abacus attendant to behold the sorcerous ticking of the automated egg timer. But I think now that when they saw those things, they were afraid. As I am afraid now.\nRead more",

          "description": "I’m quite smitten by the Nintendo DS stylings and traditional roguelike charms of Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon Of Serpentcoil Island, but I’m having real trouble summoning up the motivation to repeatedly grind through its opening levels to get to the interesting stuff. Early stages soon lose any real sense of surprise, and later ones can feel low on real agency. I want a new roguelike run to feel vital and verdant; heady with grand plans and plan-shattering twists. But by having randomness influence each run so significantly, Mystery Dungeon feels fickle instead of emergent - less than the sum of some incredibly novel and creative parts.\nRead more",

As the main antagonist in Indiana Jones And The Great Circle, Emmerich Voss vacates the archetypal armchair usually reserved for secondary fascist goons, so that he can goosestep straight into the big boy seat himself. He smiles with all the sleaze of right-hand-man Major Toht, the grubby gestapo who gets that right hand burned in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Yet he also engages in the pseudo-intellectual trash talk of the main archaeological rivals to Jones, like Rene Belloq or Walter Donovan. He is a hideous grab bag of all the things that make an instantly detestable villain in the series. But there's something else. Voss is so immediately and gutturally hateable because he resembles a type of racist encountered not in the 1930s, but one you've probably met today: the asshole you meet on the internet.\nWarning: Here be spoilers.\nRead more",

As one must when encountering horror media, the game and I immediately enter a spiritual staring contest, each of us knowing the real game here was it trying to freak me out. \"It’s fine\", I decided. \"It’s just a heart! I’ve got a heart. It’s actually very useful. Nothing to be scared of\". Thing is, Eclipsium’s menu heart is actually massive and sits, like The Eye Of Sauron, atop a giant obelisk. “Ah. That’s definitely a horror thing, that” I was forced to admit. \"If my heart was on a giant obelisk, I’d be proper shaken up, I reckon.\"\nSo starts Eclipsium’s very first bit of aggressive disorientation, and it basically just escalates from there. I obviously can’t describe the vibes without slightly spoiling the vibes, so do pop over to Steam for a demo if you’re curious and, oh, there’s a potted plant, the sound of its rustling mixed in such a way that it sort of sounds like it’s shrieking at me.

It’s a great feeling to begin your week identifying an archetype of diminutive magician, and I hope it becomes a regular occurrence. Another pleasant  discovery was Oolo itself, which you can discover yourself through the shrouded magic of this link to it’s free demo.\n(Do I need to keep writing ‘free demo’, by the way?

          "description": "The protagonists of two of my all time favourite RPGs share something in common. Both (the best Final Fantasy game) Final Fantasy 8’s Squall and The Witcher 3’s Geralt simply cannot get enough of leaving their friends and the entire world in mortal peril while they sneak in a quick round of cards, and I love them for it. Way back when the Wild Hunt released, there was a special edition kicking about that gave you a few decks for Gwent - the fleshed-out, playable card distraction that ended up being responsible for some of the game’s best moments. I pined for those decks, but I never acquired them. Now, Hatchette Board Games is putting out a full physical edition of Gwent next year.\nThe set contains \"over 400 cards and a playmat\" for £44/$39.99. I’m still recovering from various Fantasy Flight LCGs, so my value sense for this stuff might be a bit skewed, but that strikes me as incredibly reasonable. A good Gwent deck consists of only about 25 cards. They’re not bad cards, either! I’ve got a real pet hate for tabletop versions of videogames that just use in-engine screenshots for the cards, but these ones look to have the proper artwork from the game on them:\nRead more",

Why, I remember it like it was March, and not actually Summer, when the delightful free game about a mucky pomeranian was unleashed into the world. Yep, yep. It was definitely March. Roughly translating to ‘covered in mud doggy’, the game set you the task of racking up tangible financial damage to your owner’s house by getting mud everywhere - first by normal dog means, and then with giant mud cannons. You can grab it for free on Steam here.\nIt stole our hearts, it did. And talking of stealing things and having a good time doing it, it’s also releasing on the Nintendo Switch soon, which means the Steam version of Doronko Wanko is getting some free DLC to celebrate. It isn’t arriving until next Spring, but it’s bringing three new mystery dog breeds with it when it does.\nRead more",

The Hitlerites and blackshirts of Indiana Jones And The Great Circle sneeze and cough as they patrol the dig sites of Gizeh, or the marble corridors of the Vatican. Although this is the Machine Games' clever way of letting you know where your enemies are at all times, it is also mildly funny, as if all the Nazis have been secretly kissing each other, spreading the same rhinovirus from Italy to Egypt to Nepal and beyond. More than that, it's a stubborn reminder that, despite the many hours of perfectly motion-captured cinematics that accompany all this, you are still playing a video game. A snotty tissue that separates the Indy of taut two-hour cinema and the Indy of a sweeping first-person punch 'em up that will take days to complete.

At best. I’d successfully lured some bandits into the deadly lair of a bucket-tossing Poltergeist, but several attempts at more actively siccing mutated pigs on the Zone’s human baddies had all failed, even when I’d seemed to actually tame one.\nNow, my only friend lay dead at my feet, and I’m in dire need of some new beasts to master. And some cash. It turns out that a fighting style that involves letting shopping trolley-sized swine creatures chew on my heels is bad for the ol’ HP, and having recently blown my savings on half a sausage, I’m forced to shift focus from my current debt collection mission towards a means to fill my own coffers.\nRead more",

Still, it’s not often we see psychological horror combined with ultraviolence, and anything that gives off even a whiff of Condemned: Criminal Origins has my attention.\nTotal Chaos started life as a popular Doom 2 mod, and while I dare the say the limitations of that game sell the atmosphere a little better than this much sleeker update, I certainly trust Trigger Happy enough to make the most of the new engine. The game is set in New Oasis, a “once bustling haven for coal miners” that is now most definitely not bustling, nor haven-like.\nRead more",

History actually remembers Computer Artworks’s 2002 shooty horror game for how incredibly ambitious and conceptually inventive its proto-sus social squad system was. In homage to the body-snatching alien paranoia of Carpenter’s 1982 horror classic, The Thing tasks you with not just assembling and directing a squad, but keeping them from breaking down or turning on you - in fear you might be hosting the titular molecular stowaway.\nRead more",

          "description": "“So, you’ve fallen off a mountain,” strikes me as a brilliant book to write and then stock in every mountainside gift shop across the land, purely for the image of a falling climber rapidly scanning the pages as they tumble comically to their doom, searching for the one piece of sage advice that might alleviate their predicament. If you, personally, are reading RPS while falling off a mountain at this very moment, I’m afraid I can’t help you. Luckily, if you bonk your head on Steam on the way down, you’ll find a demo for stylish open world climbing game Cairn, which should hopefully distract you from your imminent pancaking.\nCairn is from The Game Bakers, of Furi and Haven fame. We first saw it at the Day Of The Devs this year. I was fresh off the lovely Jusant at the time. “Ah, another relaxing and whimsical French game about mountain climbing!” I thought. I was a fool. It’s far more intense, this one, although there are dashes of Breath Of The Wild and Death Stranding to add some whimsy and wonder to your Sisyphean struggle. Plus, it's very pretty. Here’s some new footage, or possibly some old footage depending on badly the embargo has messed up my schedule.\nRead more",

          "description": "One of my favourite anime shows is Sakura Quest. It's the story of an unemployed lady from Tokyo who accidentally gets herself appointed \"Queen\" of a struggling backwater village by the regional tourist board. From that case of mistaken identity proceeds 25 whole-ass episodes of Machiavellian haggling with crusty bigwigs over things like organising a concert. It's playfully dull, heartily mundane entertainment. No supernatural flourishes here - just the magic of paperwork and the thrill of bureaucracy.\r\n\n\r\nI'm reminded of Sakura Quest by Danchi Days, a forthcoming cosy adventure with irresponsibly enticing Game Boy Advance-style visuals. It casts you as Hoshino, a teenage girl who's just moved to an old \"danchi\" housing complex and is trying to revive the yearly tradition of a summer festival. How will she do this? By means of haggling - haggling, and a bit of CSI. \r\n \nRead more",

Geopolitics are fractious and unnerving, environmental catastrophe seems more likely each day, and rampant digitally-disseminated disinformation further erodes our trust in one another. But I'll let lesser reporters tell you about that stuff. I'm here to report that Capcom have made the big bonk feel good again. They’ve heard player feedback on the missing weapon oomph caused by the lack of hitstop in the Monster Hunter Wilds beta, and they’re bringing back the bonk.\nHere’s a handy breakdown of the issue by X user Blue Stigma, but briefly: hitstop is the brief pause in an attack animation the moment the weapon connects with an enemy, giving you a real sense of bonkitude and making say, a hammer feel different from a dagger. As the video showed, the hitstop was greatly reduced in Wilds compared to previous Monster Hunters, and many players reported the combat just feeling a bit off as a result.\nRead more",

In those respects, I was correct.\nI'd just missed the really big part - the fact it's a pacifistic Genshin Impact wearing a pretty dress. And as that realisation sunk in for the first time, my heart also sank with it. I really tried, I mean really tried to get into Nikki's gacha offerings; to delight in its menagerie of menus and cash in countless currencies for fun socks or glitzy tiaras.

          "description": "Geoff Keighley got really emotional for some reason before using an orchestra to reveal that an Okami sequel is on its way. (Hopefully) tentatively titled Okami Sequel, it will be helmed by Hideki Kamiya. That's all we know.\n\n\nIt's still an interesting announcement, since Kamiya left Capcom in 2006 with the closure of Clover Studios. In fact, Keighley did mention Clover, so I don't know what that means.\n\n\n\n\nWe last saw Okami with 2010's Okamiden, which released on DS after the closure of Clover. The original game is rather celebrated and continues to see re-releases, so it getting a sequel is a little less surprising than Kamiya working with Capcom again. Regardless, we don't know anything about it. It's barely a teaser. We didn't even get a name, and showing it as \"Okami Sequel\" is super awkward. But there you have it.\n\n\nOkami Sequel has announced targeted platforms or release date.\n\nThe post Hideki Kamiya is returning to work on ‘Okami Sequel’ and that’s all we know appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Borderlands 4 showcased a new trailer at The Game Awards 2024, and there are plenty of reasons for the fans to be excited.\n\n\nOf course, a lot of important information is yet to be revealed, including the final release date. But there were some important moments in the trailer, including what could be a new movement mechanic. Fans can wishlist the game as of writing, and it could be the start of a new chapter altogether for the franchise.\n\n\nBorderlands 4 could be a direct sequel to Borderlands 3\n\n\nFor all things better and worse, Borderlands 3 has largely been a mixed affair for the fans. With Borderlands 4, Gearbox has chosen to make the most ambitious project of all time. The official first-look title might not have given us a launch date, but it looks like the good old Pandora that we know.\n\n\nPlayers are likely going to have the option to choose between different characters, just like in Borderlands 3. There was a specific scene in the trailer that highlighted the presence of guns of different rarities, which has always been a strong point of the franchise.\n\n\n\n\nOutside that, fans will have to wait till there's an official release date. The game is going to be available for PC and consoles, and it appears (based on now) that old-gen will not be getting the new game. We also know that the release will happen in 2025, and an exact date is likely going to be announced soon by Gearbox. \n\nThe post Borderlands 4 gets maiden trailer with more guns to ‘break free’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

I know what you're thinking, but it looks pretty distinct from the Yakuza/Like a Dragon series, even if it seems to be in the same genre.\n\n\nThere's not a whole lot to go on in the trailer. It takes place in 1915 in what looks like Tokyo. However, it's heavily industrialized and seems to have a lot more Western influence, implying an alternate history. The plot isn't really outlined, but you seem to play as a thug (typical Ryu ga Gotoku). Combat seems a bit faster, more chaotic, and more violent than your typical Like a Dragon, which was already pretty brutal.\n\n\n\n\nNot much else to go on aside from that. However, what has been shown has piqued my interest.\n\n\nRyu ga Gotoku hasn't announced target platforms or a release date, and it's unlikely that Project Century will be the final name.

Even though there's not even a title yet, the brief teaser trailer certainly gives the classic world-building vibes the creators are known for.\n\n\n\n\nThe game will be published by Epic Games Publishing, and will be available on the Epic Games Store, PlayStation, and Xbox. The Tokyo-based team is led by game director Fumito Ueda.\n\n\nNot much was revealed about the game, but in the teaser, we see a character climbing up a mech as a countdown voice commands to evacuate all areas within a 25km radius of ground zero, followed by a 60-second countdown. As the player reaches the cockpit of the mech, an apocalyptic wave of destruction rumbles in the distance headed toward the player who evacuates the mech from a pod in its head at the last second.\n\n\nEven though it was brief, the world already has me interested. And it's hard to argue, the climbing up the mech certainly gave me nostalgia for climbing up the colossal beasts of Shadow of the Colossus.

Like every good gacha, there's a tier list of all the characters currently available inside the game. This tier list will help you to sort out your early team, and invest the resources efficiently. \n\n\nGran Saga tier list\n\n\nI have kept three tiers to classify the characters. In Gran Saga, you can potentially use any character currently available to build your team. \n\n\n\nS-tier: Strong characters who should be future-proof for the power curve. \n\n\nA-tier: Decent characters who can be as good as S-tier in certain situations. \n\n\nB-tier: Good characters who will need a lot of time and investment to reach the late-game stages. \n\n\n\nIn Gran Saga, characters also have their own elemental type, and it's important to make a squad well-balanced in general to cover the strengths and weaknesses. \n\n\nGran Saga S-tier list\n\n\n\nQuyi\n\n\nSeriade\n\n\nFuxiao\n\n\nHilda\n\n\nOrta\n\n\nJun\n\n\n\nGran Saga A-tier list\n\n\n\nLas\n\n\nChristina\n\n\nYuna\n\n\nMikokoro\n\n\nIvan\n\n\nKaito\n\n\nElio\n\n\nWyin\n\n\nLeon\n\n\nKarte\n\n\n\nGran Saga B-tier list\n\n\n\nKarcion\n\n\nIgnox\n\n\nNamarie\n\n\nLuin\n\n\n\nWhile it's still early days, I would prefer to build a team with a single type of damage. In simpler words, it's better to go for either a full-magic team, or a full-physical. It's not easy as you won't have the top-tier names from both types immediately after starting the game. That said, the pulls have so far been pretty generous, so making a top team won't be a difficult ask at all. \n\nThe post Gran Saga tier list of best characters (December 2025) appeared first on Destructoid.",

While it will be a new saga entirely, the game is going to be called The Witcher 4. From the looks of the trailer itself, it will be a direct sequel to the main of the first trilogy, and players will be able to play as none other than Ciri.\n\n\nCiri officially takes over from Geralt in The Witcher 4\n\n\nThere has been plenty of speculation about what to expect from the new Witcher game. The Game Awards 2024 show has shed the first light, and Ciri will be the main character in the new title. Of course, she has followed in the footsteps of Geralt, and she's now a Witcher herself.\n\n\nThe render, which wasn't gameplay footage in a direct sense, gave the audience a glimpse at some of the potential dangers that Ciri will be facing. The opening footage had her facing a fierce monster to save a village girl from being slaughtered. \n\n\n\n\nIt's the first glimpse of the lore that's going to be present in the upcoming project. So far, Ciri remains the only familiar face on the reveal, but it's safe to expect for known faces from The Witcher universe.

For more, fans will have to wait, and a release date is yet to be announced.\n\n\nIt will be interesting to find out more details about the story and if it will be a direct continuation of the events that took place in The Witcher 3. \n\nThe post The Witcher 4 premiers at The Game Awards 2024 with a familiar face appeared first on Destructoid.",

One such fish is the Helicoprion, a prehistoric shark famous for its spiral-shaped jaw with razor-sharp teeth. This great beast can be tough to get a hold of, so if you’re struggling, we’re here to help you out.\n\n\nWhere to find Helicoprion in Fisch\n\n\nThe Helicoprion shark can only be found at the Ancient Isle, far east. This island is full of prehistoric fish, including other famous sea creatures like the Mosasaurus and the Megalodon.\n\n\nIt’s no cakewalk to get to, either, as whirlpools and other hazards surround the island. Take it slow. Once you’ve reached it, I recommend heading to the waterfall for the best chance to catch a Helicoprion, casting your bait nearby.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHow to get the Helicoprion in Fisch\n\n\nThe Helicoprion prefers Squid for bait, which you can get from Bait Crates, Common Crates, and Quality Bait Crates. While you can catch this prehistoric shark during any season and any time of day, they do prefer clear weather.\n\n\nOnce you’ve caught one on your lure, a pink exclamation point will appear about your avatar’s head. The Helicoprion shark will move around very erratically, so you’ll need to pay close attention to the fishing bar. You’ll also be hit with a significant progress speed decrease of 70%.\n\n\nHowever, so long as you pay attention to the bar, you’ll be able to catch the Helicoprion without too much trouble. The biggest challenge comes from actually hooking one, it being a Mythical fish and all that. However, once you do catch it, you’ll get a sweet 2,500 XP as a reward. Not too shabby. Plus, it’s a great fish to show off to your friends to make them jealous. \n\nThe post How to catch a Helicoprion in Fisch appeared first on Destructoid.",

You can easily hop on any boat and make your way over to begin fishing in the area. You can see it directly from the docks on the back of the island. I’d recommend standing on the corner of the island facing the main part of Moosewood as this area has the highest spawn rate for the Whisker Bill.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHow to get the Whisker Bill in Fisch\n\n\nYou’ll want a Truffle Worm to lure the Whisker Bill in, which you can find inside Coral Geodes, Volcanic Geodes, or Treasure Chests. Coral Geodes only cost 600 C$ from the shop, so I’d recommend these. If you complete 50 or more Angler quests, you’ll also get a Truffle Worm for your trouble. \n\n\nOnce you’ve got the bait and are at the right spot, cast your lure into the water. The Whisker Bill doesn’t have any preference for time of day, season, or weather, but it is a Mythical-class rarity fish, so it won't be easy to find. When you’ve got one on your lure, a pink exclamation point will pop up, indicating that you’re luring a Mythical fish.\n\n\nThe Whisker Bill moves around the fishing bar a lot, and you’ll take a 20% progress speed decrease when trying to catch it. This won’t be too noticeable unless you have a very fast rod, but you can still tell.\n\n\nWhether you’re looking to complete your Bestiary or just want to show off to your friends, the Whisker Bill is a great fish and gives you a nice 150 XP when you catch it.\n\nThe post How to catch the Whisker Bill in Fisch appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "When it comes to huge multiplayer releases like Marvel Rivals, the question is whether the game is cross-play or cross-platform. In many cases, it does, but in instances like this, the answer will vary.\n\n\nDoes Marvel Rivals have cross-progression?\n\n\nUnfortunately, Marvel Rivals does not have or support cross-progression. If you were hoping to play on PC and switch over to consoles like Xbox or PS5, you wouldn’t be able to carry progression over, including skins and unlocks. \n\n\nThis does mean that all purchases will have to be made again if you play between platforms. All earned currencies like Units, Lattice, and Chrono Tokens will have to be earned or purchased again too.\n\n\nDoes Marvel Rivals have crossplay?\n\n\nLuckily, if you want to at least play with friends on other matchmaking pools, you can do that. There are some restrictions, though.\n\n\nIf you have a group that wants to play together, then Quick Play, Conquest, Custom Games, and Practice modes will be the only things you can play. Ranked and Competitive modes will be restricted.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nWhat to do if you have multiple platforms to play on\n\n\nIf you want to partake in activities like ranked, especially with friends, you will have to all coordinate playing on the same matchmaking realm.\n\n\nFor example, PC players can only play with PC, and console players can only play between Xbox and PlayStation. Due to mechanics like aim assist on consoles and PC players being able to turn quicker, these two matchmaking pools have to be separate. \n\n\nThe last hurdle in matching together on the same Competitive matchmaking pool is that you need to ensure you’re level 10 to play in these playlists. Otherwise, you’ll only have Quickplay. \n\n\nAnd if quickplay is the case, you’re better off sticking to your primary platform for the foreseeable future so you won’t miss out on account and Battle Pass progression.\n\nThe post Does Marvel Rivals have cross-progression?

          "description": "As a resident of Brick Life, you must do your part by keeping the city clean. This requires you to take out the trash every once in a while, whether for tasks or to simply make it nice and tidy. Here's how to clean trash in LEGO Fortnite Brick Life.\n\n\nHow to clean trash or throw something out in Brick Life\n\n\nYou may have trouble finding litter when you begin the 'Clean Trash or Throw Something Out' task in Brick Life. I ran into this issue initially, especially since waste will be pretty hidden. The main thing you need to look for is trash cans that have a bag on top of it. Or, you can pick up litter from Watch-O-Plex. Trash can locations will be randomized, but I've had the most luck finding them near Durr Burger. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe Durr Burger Line Cook job features a trash-based mission, which is likely why the litter frequently appears there. You can try other locations to see if waste pops up. However, remember that trash cans without bags have already been cleaned, so there's no need to interact with them. Another superb area to check out is Watch-O-Plex, where the theater room always has trash on the ground. \n\n\nIf you haven't found a suitable trash can, you can choose the second option: throwing something out. Grab anything you don't need, like a piece of paper or a ticket. You can collect plenty of items around town, making this objective much more manageable. Then, approach any trash area to throw it out.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nUpon successfully completing the Clean Trash task in Brick Life, you'll be rewarded with 500 cash in your pocket. This is just one of the many ways to earn money in the game, besides the ATM and job objectives. Use your hard-earned cash to upgrade your home lots or get a Hoverboard.\n\nThe post How to clean trash in LEGO Fortnite Brick Life appeared first on Destructoid.",

I think I've just played the game so much that I've gradually become numb to any visual allure. But with the power of modding, I can learn to truly appreciate TES5 once more.\n\n\nThanks to Nexus Mods user shadowman2777, I can now sleep with a cow. No, no. Not like that. Please try to focus here. I mean, \"Sleep With Any Cow Shout\" is a way of chilling with a fellow bovine creature while out and about in Skyrim.\n\n\nImage via shadowman2777 / Nexus Mods.\n\n\nIf you just want to kick back with a furry wild beast (again, drag your mind out of the gutter), you can employ this custom Shout, which will allow you to cuddle up to any cow you target. Why would you want to do this? Why are you being so judgmental, is my rebuttal.\n\n\nFus-Cow-Dah!\n\n\nSeriously, look how chilled out the guy in the image above looks, craning his neck to feel rested against the animal's stomach. Ignore the well-endowed woman in the neon pink cocktail dress who's standing nearby. I'm sure she's not related to the mod.\n\n\nOh, there is one thing I should probably say. While, yes, there are cows in Skyrim, they don't appear like the ones in the images shared by shadowman2777 on Nexus. This is because – according to the description – this mod seems to require another download: \"FNIS Creatures.\" I'm not sure if this is for the animations or these particular types of cows. In any case, if you need it, you can download if from here.\n\n\nBy now, you should all have enough Skyrim mods installed to make the aging RPG look like a different game entirely. No, but seriously, if Bethesda doesn't let us mod The Elder Scrolls 6 by improving the visuals, adding custom quests, or changing the names of the Frost Trolls to Tim Allen for some reason, what even is the point?\n\nThe post Time to cuddle cows with this Skyrim mod appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Čekal jsem od Hugha Granta v roli chlípného starce hodně, a i přesto jsem byl příjemně překvapen. Je skvělý. Scénář není hloupý a nabízí pár námětů k zamyšlení nad tím, jak funguje víra. Bohužel, ke konci se film trochu neuspořádaně rozutíká do různých směrů, jako by se tvůrci neuměli rozhodnout, o čem to vlastně celé bylo. (Ilča 65 %)",

          "description": "Mladá studentka Jindřiška přichází domů a zjišťuje, že jejich luxusní dům je v dražbě, všechen majetek v exekuci a její otec se kdesi skrývá a není k zastižení, zatímco matka netuší, co se vlastně stalo a jak otec ty dluhy nadělal, nebo o tom aspoň nechce mluvit. Debutující scenárista a režisér Vojtěch Strakatý nám přináší drama děvčete, které netuší, co si počít.\n\n\nExistuje vícero českých filmů, které surfují na oblíbené vlně \"zakažte exekutory, zrušte dluhy, je to nelidské!\" (například Tancuj Matyldo). After Party takovým filmem není. Exekutoři se v něm chovají korektně a slušně a vinu na situaci celé rodiny nese naprosto jednoznačně otec, který neopatrně investoval, i když nevíme jak. A \"nevíme jak\" je téma, prolínající se celým tímto filmem. Takže nevíme, co vlastně otec komu naslibova…",
