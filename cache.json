First up, Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Hinokami Chronicles retains the top spot this week with 20,964 units sold, but Nintendo Switch Sports and Mario Strikers: Battle League have swapped positions, slightly altering the top three. Mario Strikers' sales fell off considerably from the previous week, marking a 147% drop in total sales.\nMeanwhile, in a rather curious turn of events, Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl have re-entered the top ten charts with 5,043 units sold, bringing the total sales since the games' launch to a respectable 2,560,536 units.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Steve Jackson will remember that.\nWay back in the day, long before video games were any good, the cool new narrative mechanic was Choose Your Own Adventure books. Wildly popular back in the '70s, '80s, and '90s, the CYOA genre died off sharpish with the invention of point-and-click games, text adventures, and video games with vast, sprawling branching stories, which allowed players to have all the fun of meaningful choices without all the tedium of having to turn to page 32 only to find out that you've died, again. Well, you still died a lot. But the computer did the page-turning bit for you, at least.\nThe CYOA genre came back around full circle in 2013, with Inkle's fearless adaptation of the Sorcery! books by the founder of Games Workshop and Lionhead Studios, Steve Jackson. Inkle is a studio known for its mastery of word-wrangling; the very thought of attempting to map out the intricacies of the stories the team writes is enough to send just about any writer screaming for the sweet release of death. It was Sorcery! that catapulted Inkle into the spotlight — and now, with its four-part series ported to the Nintendo Switch, hopefully more people can see why.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

There's just something timeless about it, right? Not to mention there was a distinct lack of discourse around the graphics back in the day (okay, perhaps a slight resentment from fans at the slow evolution of the series' visuals, but that's about it).\nPokémon's visuals, in this writer's opinion, really peaked around Gen 5, which consisted of Pokémon Black and White, plus their immediate sequels. Now don't get us wrong, we're loving the look of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet so far, but we can't help but wonder what such games would look like with the older pixelated visual style in place of the more modern 3D graphics.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "I still don't know whether to describe The Heroic Legend Of Eagarlnia as \"complicated\" or \"simple\". Before starting a game, it gives an impression of being a complex grand strategy that's something like a fantasy Total War with a D&D alignment system and a distinctly East Asian focus on characters and dialogue.\nIt's far simpler than that. There was a period of disappointment, even, when it seemed like there wasn't much to it at all. That's partly because it's easy to play it too passively, or get stuck in attritional stand offs, and partly because of the need for a bit too much repetition. But over time its subtler details become more apparent, and your choices start to feel more multifaceted.\nAnd yet, it remains at heart the same throughout. On your first ten turns you're doing the same actions as in your 200th, and its battles in particular are largely hands off. So maybe it's complicated, but simple to actually play? Hmm.\nRead more",

Oxenfree was good, and Oxenfree II looks to be doing those same things that made Oxenfree good. A 2D, side-on supernatural thriller with radios. Good thing remains good! In a world where sequels to beloved media seem to only get progressively worse, I'll happily take it (especially since this one is a Netflix-published project now). And although it's directly related to the first game, the characters and happenings in Oxenfree II are distinct enough that it's going to be accessible if you're new to the series. And even if you did play the first game, it's possible that Oxenfree II will be more thrilling and unsettling to you now, five years later.\nRead more",

This would involve, as they always do, a bunch of benchmark tests: repeatable runs through a specific area or sequence that would give an accurate indication of how different settings and hardware affect performance. In most games these are either quick and easy or time-consuming and easy, but not The Cycle: Frontier. Oh no.\r\n\n\r\nSee, without a dedicated benchmarking tool, running these kinds of tests requires a certain controllable environment, where variables are known and parameters can be reset in a click. This is not the case for The Cycle: Frontier, whose environment is usually trying to fucking kill you, particularly though the unavoidable presence of other players. I’ve never sat down to record some average FPS values only to spend half my time cowering behind a tree, fearful of being shot, robbed and – worst of all – forced to start work over again.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Dear reader, Neon White kicks ass.\nThe game opens with an extremely anime narrative sequence and we’re introduced to the lovable (and less so) doofuses we’ll be shooting up paradise with. This is where most folks will stop and squee at the fact that player character Neon White is voiced by the incomparable Steve Blum, perhaps known best for his role as sonorous space cowboy Spike Spiegel in Cowboy Bebop.

Cue a heady mix of confusion and perturbation – surely Intel weren’t suggesting that Arc GPUs would only function when paired with an Intel CPU, and a relatively new one at that?\r\n\n\r\nNo, they weren’t, though the guide’s vague wording isn’t doing it – and worse, potential Arc users – any favours. Parts of the guide appear to conflate support for Resizable BAR with support for the Arc A-series in general, which further muddies things as Resizable BAR works on AMD Ryzen chips as well as those three Core CPU generations. I asked Intel directly for clarification and essentially, Arc GPUs won’t have such super specific CPU requirements just to run - though they’ll apparently perform better in systems that do support Resizable BAR.\r\n\n \nRead more",

There were some demos I was meant to play for, like, actual work, and then I ran into a puzzle wall or a bug or something so I just fired up Necrosmith again.\nNecrosmith is a 2D necromance 'em up that is also sort of a tower defence game. In the middle of the map is your evil lair, the Hall Of Bones, a sort of legally distinct Sauron's tower that gets more flying buttresses the more you upgrade it. If enemies (which can be packs of wolves or flying bugs or all manner of things) do enough damage to destroy it, you lose - so that's your defense bit. For the towers bit, you have to imagine that the towers can move on their own, and also that they're shambling undead monsters made from a jigsaw of different limbs you find, like an army of very unhygenic Mr Potato Heads.\nRead more",

I'd seen it in a hands-off capacity and thought it looked like it could be in line for the Soulslike throne, but with Action-RPGs it's all about hand feel: does it feel rough or smooth under the thumbsticks? As luck would have it, I managed to get hands-on with the game to confirm whether its substance does, in fact, match its style. Here are my findings.\nRead more",

The RTS potential for an interplanetary ground war against overwhelming swarms of giant not-insects is obvious enough. But the dual spirit of most Paul Verhoeven films is a major reason that The Extraordinary Lust Of Dizzy (working title: Starship Troopers) still holds up 25 years on.\n\r\n\r\nTerran Command understands that. Certainly it nods to the satire here and there, but mostly it focuses on the shooting and desperate defences and evacuations instead. This was the right decision. Though it's a little short on narrative flavour, unless you're really into exploring the setting, it's got enough tactical heft to make up for it.\r\n\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Farthest Frontier, which arrives on Steam Early Access on August 9th, sounds as much of a statement of intent as it does the name of a city-building game. It’s a combination of town management and survival sim, putting you in the presumably cheap clogs of a band of settlers trying to make a go of it in the wilderness. A story trailer for Farthest Frontier was shown at last weekend’s PC Gaming Show, which you can watch below.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Lasting about three hours, Shredder’s Revenge won’t become your new time sink, but it’s an undemanding arcadey jaunt that you can enjoy while munching on pizza with pals.

Now, though, the update has graduated to the main, stable Proton branch, so you don’t have to risk the potential wonkiness of a work-in-progress.

          "description": "A few days ago I sat in on a presentation for Lightyear Frontier, a 3D farming and crafting game set on a remote planet at the edge of the galaxy. In fact in the presentation the game was referred to as a \"farmadventure\", which isn't a portmanteau and you only have to go another centimetere along to get farmventure, which is just about a portmanteau and, furthermore, is fun to say. \nDevelopers Frame Break are keen to emphasise how chilled out Lightyear Frontier is: it's very peaceful, and there's no death (a \"survival game without survival\"). It's all about ecology and being one with nature. This does, at times, feel slightly at odds with the other eye-catching thing about Lightyear Frontier, which is a bloody massive tractor mech stomping about everywhere. \nRead more",

          "description": "A classic adventure remastered by Nightdive\nOne of Westwood's classics is enhanced and available again, this time for modern hardware. Blade Runner: Enhanced Edition is finally out today for PC and consoles.\nNightdive Studios put together this remastered version of the 1997 adventure classic. It's available digitally on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox consoles, and on the Nintendo Switch. The Enhanced Edition is also getting a Limited Run physical version, too.\nWhile Westwood may be known for its history in the real-time strategy genre, Blade Runner was its surprise adventure hit. It runs alongside the Ridley Scott film, weaving through the events of the movie. It has branching paths though, and has been well-remembered for both its style and impressive design.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDxS2jh76Kg\nRemastered dreams of electric sheep\nNightdive, the studio which has tackled other remasters like System Shock: Enhanced Edition, has put a few modern touches on Blade Runner. Since it's coming to consoles, gamepad support is an obvious one.\nThe original Westwood videos have been upscaled to 4K resolution and 60 frames per second. There is also an HD display, and a new clue interface. Plus, international fans can use the original foreign-language translations in Spanish, German, French, Italian, and Chinese subtitles.\nAs for reception? Well, it currently seems iffy. Users on Steam are voting it into the Mostly Negative tier on launch day. Rock Paper Shotgun also had some words about this Enhanced Edition compared to other options, and provided some good comparison screenshots.\nThere is another version of the original Blade Runner just for PC, on GOG. So if your impressions of the Enhanced Edition are similarly tepid, you can at least pick that one up instead.\nThe post Blade Runner: Enhanced Edition is out now for PC and consoles appeared first on Destructoid.",

Well, it looks like we finally have our confirmation, thanks to a Reddit AMA response from Overwatch 2's director Aaron Keller. Yesterday, when a player asked Keller if the first Overwatch will be shut down after the sequel leaves early access, he responded that \"When OW2 launches on Oct 4th it will be a replacement for the current Live Service.\"\nIf Twitter is any indication, players are still pretty confused about what's supposed to happen to the first Overwatch game after OW2 is officially out.\nBack when Overwatch 2 was announced, former game director Jeff Kaplan had promised th…",

Over 6,000 accounts co-streamed the broadcast, while \"Twitter Conversation\" was up 100% on last year's stream, with the usage of \"#thegameawards\" hashtag up by 69%.

Before then, we can expect to see Keighley do his stage show thang thing at Gamescom's Opening Night Live stream on August 24, and, of course, at The Game Awards 2023, which is scheduled to take place this winter.\nYou can check out our full coverage of Summer Game Fest 2022 right here.\nThe post Summer Game Fest live stream hit a peak of 3.5 million viewers appeared first on Destructoid.",

That same account has confirmed that the distribution event will run from June 22, 2022 through June 1, 2023 at 5AM PT. So if you're putting this off for nearly a year, just remember that you need to wake up early that day.\nThe actual prize is called the \"Shiny Baneful Fox Mask,\" which is \"inspired by the Hisuian Snow animation.\" Hey, that's still kind of fresh! The third (and final) episode literally just debuted on the official Pokemon YouTube channel this week, featuring a young boy named Alec living in the Pokemon Legends timeline.\nThere's a lot of potential to deliver more innovative mystery gifts like this, and masks in Legends is a decent start. But there's so much more the team can do with the system, especially when you consider the last two years leading to a bigger rise in online gaming.

It seems, however, that there was a third piece of KoF news that day... Though you might not find it for looking.\nOn Tuesday, eagle-eyed fans spotted a new Twitter account advertising something plainly called \"The King of Fighters Crypto\" (or \"CryptoKOF\"). This endeavor — not developed by but allegedly \"authorized by\" SNK — appears to be a blockchain/NFT project based upon the crossover fighting series. According to the Twitter page, The King of Fighters Crypto would see \"The return of the king, to fight again in the metaverse arena.\"\nYou already know what happened next. Like so many similar announcements before it, CryptoKOF was immediately hit with insults and comments of disdain from the King of Fighters community, leading the Twitter page to go private within mere hours of its initial discovery. While this is not SNK's first dabble in the NFT market (the company already has a deal with online market OnBuff to sell NFTs based on SNK properties), it is yet another example of the gaming community turning toward the blockchain market and telling it — quite succinctly — that it is not welcome here.\nAnd the horse you rode in on, fellas.\nFor more reading on NFTs/blockchain technology and gaming, check out Jonathon Holmes' report.\nThe post The King of Fighters Crypto appears, gets insulted, vanishes appeared first on Destructoid.",

The sequel was praised for its comical script and likable characters, but criticized for its length and relatively rote narrative.\nSonic the Hedgehog 2 is currently number eight in the Top Ten Highest Grossing Movies of 2022, with the sequel still yet to hit the financially lucrative box office markets of Hong Kong and Japan, which will likely add further coffers to the Paramount Pictures vault. Of course, the incredible success of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is a consistent reminder of how things could have been so different for the cinematic adaptation. Still, it's good to know that the \"original\" movie Sonic still eventually found his way into cinema history.\nSonic the Hedgehog 2 is available now on streaming services, with a Blu-ray and DVD release planned for August. Sonic Origins launches today on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Sonic the Hedgehog 2 smashes past $400 million box office appeared first on Destructoid.",

The only catch is that you need to try the Sunbreak demo.\nIn case you weren't aware, Capcom announced the demo roughly a week ago during their \"E3\" showcase stream, and it went live on June 14. It features a selection of missions, including an ultra hard Malzeno showdown.\nHere's the list of Monster Hunter Rise bonus items for playing the Sunbreak demo:\n60 Mega Potions\n15 Pitfall Traps\n30 Energy Drinks\n15 Mega Demondrugs\n15 Mega Armorskins\nCapcom also points out that you can get the demo directly here on Steam, or here on Switch. Seems easy enough!\nWhile veterans will likely balk at the items you'll get here, newcomers will probably want to take them up on the offer if possible. Having a ton of free items at the start saves you a lot of time, as you can get by most of the early story content through Mega Potions alone; not having to craft them is a huge plus. And you'll have that surplus by the time you actually work your way up to the Sunbreak expansion.\nhttps://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1539692222932713480\nThe post Monster Hunter Rise has a bonus item pack for Sunbreak demo users appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Saving Moonbury one potion at a time\nThe day I'll be tired of life simulators will be the day that I die, which is why I'm so excited to see another great game in the genre finally get a release date. Potion Permit is an adorable little life sim, and if you haven't seen it yet, you're in for a treat (you can also play the PC demo right now, by the way). The game is set in the small town of Moonbury, where an illness has spread. As the Medical Association's most skilled potion maker, the player is tasked with helping create the cure for the ailing townsfolk.\nLet's be honest, all of these games have a super cute art style, but I have to say Potion Permit has one of my favorite looks from a game like this in a long time. Plus, everything looks super polished, which is a huge plus going in. From the trailer, I can already get the sense too that we won't be in want of activities to pad out our playtimes.\nhttps://twitter.com/PQubeGames/status/1539579544805548032\nThere's a ton to do in Moonbury — aside from diagnosing patients, finding ingredients for potions, and of course healing them, players can get to know over thirty of the town's inhabitants, fight off fearsome creatures, and upgrade the town and the surrounding areas. There are some RPG elements too, but we haven't gotten a good look at what those might be just yet.\nOf everything Potion Permit has to offer, I think I'm probably most excited for all of the NPCs in the game. That's just around the number of NPCs you can give gifts to in Stardew Valley, and I don't want to play the comparison game too much here, but that always felt around just the right amount to me. Having a whole new cast of characters to befriend (and romance) in games like these is always a highlight for me, and I already have an NPC or two that I have my eyes on.\nPotion Permit will be available on PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and Steam on September 22, 2022.\nThe post Life sim Potion Permit brews up a fall release date appeared first on Destructoid.",

The kings of the black-and-green brand spoke about its hardware troubles in a recent statement to gaming outlet VGC, who had noticed a lack of stock online and in the high street.\n\"We know it may be hard finding Xbox Wireless Controllers right now due to supply disruptions,\" a Microsoft spokesperson told VGC. \"We’re working as fast as possible with our manufacturing and retail partners to improve this. Please check with your local retailer for availability.\"\nThe shortages appear to be most apparent in the UK and Europe, though North American territories are likely to follow suit if Microsoft is unable to ramp up production. According to ResetEra users, stores in Australia and The Netherlands are also struggling to keep their stock cupboards plentiful. Both standard controllers and Xbox's cool custom \"Design Lab\" models are affected.\nHardware and accessory shortages have continued to trouble the industry since the COVID-19 pandemic affected production and distribution cycles worldwide.

XSEED and Marvelous confirm today that Rune Factory 5 is getting a PC port on July 13.\nThe latest entry in the Rune Factory series launched earlier this year as a Nintendo Switch exclusive. The Steam version looks to be a similar offering. It's $59.99 for the standard edition (though it's currently on a pre-launch 15% discount) or $69.99 for the Digital Deluxe, which includes the Rune Factory 4 marriage candidates outfit set. Any pre-order also nets two cosmetic outfits and a New Ranger Care Package of items in-game.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Edy6Bx_G8\nFarming up a storm\nIf you're new to Rune Factory, it runs in a similar vein to Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley. The key difference is that Rune Factory puts a bit more of a focus on combat and exploring dungeons than the actual farming.\nDepending on what you're looking for, that can be a positive or negative. In our review of the Switch launch, Rune Factory 5 seemed to be playing the hits, while not necessarily winning over new hearts thanks to falling into some familiar pitfalls. Things can get repetitive and basic at times too.\nWhat a PC port might offer is a performance boost, which some might welcome. All-in-all, I was a big fan of Rune Factory 4 but stayed away from the next entry after hearing some early impressions of it. I'm hopeful the Steam version gives it enough of a boost to put it back on my radar.\nRune Factory 5 launches for PC via Steam on July 13, 2022.\nThe post Rune Factory 5 is coming to PC on July 13 appeared first on Destructoid.",

A third-person action-adventure, DreadOut 2 tells the tale of hardy schoolgirl \"Linda Meillinda,\" (holy shit), who must use her psychic ghost-whispering powers to uncover and banish an army of spooky spirits that are haunting her town. Much like the popular Fatal Frame series, Linda is aided in her efforts by her camera... though the Camera Obscura here is replaced by... a smartphone.\nExplore Ms. Mellinda's hometown, speak to members of both the living and the dead, take on an array of side-quests, venture into dark, desolate, and disquieting corners, or just take a literal hammer to the bonce of the undead. Keep your proton pack, Spengler. DreadOut 2 expands upon the original game with a tighter focus on both exploration and combat, but is still jam-packed with terrifying monstrosities and more than a fistful of jump scares. While it's no Resident Evil, it will certainly fit the bill for those looking for a few ghoulish scenarios on a tired evening.\nDreadOut 2 launches July 15 on Xbox platforms, with PlayStation to follow on July 20, priced at around $20. It is available to purchase right now for PC via Steam.\nThe post Cult horror sequel DreadOut 2 coming to PlayStation and Xbox in July appeared first on Destructoid.",

Turns out that Nexon is still not done revealing characters for its upcoming fighter DNF Duel, which is literally less than six days away from launch. Today's DNF Duel trailer introduces us to the Lost Warrior, who carries with him the undeniable presence and physical aura of a potential boss character.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqaHE0JwIJ8\nThe Lost Warrior, as you can see in the video above, carries himself with the visual appearance of primordial times, but with a fighting style and mastery of magic beyond his years, suggesting that he may be capable of visiting multiple worlds and eras. Lost Warrior commands the battleground with devastating large strikes, reminiscent of King of Fighters' Rugal. The silver fox is also capable of switching positions with his opponent and rounds off the battle by repeatedly slamming his foe into handy nearby mountains. Ouch.\nLost Warrior is, officially, the final character to join the DNF Duel launch roster, which now totals 16 distinct and unique fighters. I'm still pretty much at a loss for who I'm gonna be digging into, but Enchantress and Inquisitor are both pretty solid calls for me. I hope to share my findings on Nexon's underdog fighter with you all soon. In the meantime, maybe check out the previous trailers for Berserker, Grappler, Hitman, Inquisitor, Striker, Ranger, Dragon Knight, Vanguard, Kunoichi, Crusader, Ghostblade, Launcher, Troubleshooter, Swift Master, and Enchantress.\nDNF Duel launches on PlayStation and PC platforms June 28.\nThe post DNF Duel is STILL revealing new characters, here is the Lost Warrior appeared first on Destructoid.",

Old pop culture collectibles have become priceless artifacts in this world, so the goal is to plunder more memorabilia than the other crews and get them out.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0694XcFmI7M\nIt looks like Hyenas is really leaning into the pop culture and \"irreverent\" tone, as creative director Charlie Bewsher describes in a post-premiere interview. Zero-G movement and combat also look to play a factor. Each playable Hyena also has unique abilities, to cater to whatever playstyle you'd want.\nScraps of nostalgia\nHyenas really looks to be another entry in the Tarkov-influenced extraction shooter genre. We've seen plenty of these, from Rainbow Six Extraction to Battlefield 2042's Hazard Zone.\nWhat seems to be setting Hyenas apart is the tone itself. It's taking a bright and brazen approach that feels right in line with the likes of Borderlands. That, plus hoards full of nostalgic loot and references, like the Nixon mask and a Rubik's Cube.\nCreative Assembly has made some stellar games, including Alien: Isolation and the Total War games, but I can't really say I'm sold on Hyenas just yet. It will have a chance to prove itself ahead of its 2023 launch though. Sign-ups for the Alpha Test are live right now over on the game's website.\nOtherwise, Hyenas is aiming to launch in 2023 for PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, and PS5.\nThe post Hyenas is Sega’s new pop culture-infused sci-fi FPS appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Losing Faith\nStudio DICE has stated that it intends to entirely focus its efforts on the beleaguered Battlefield franchise going forward, eschewing new IPs and alternate franchises such as the studio's cult series Mirror's Edge while it ensures Battlefield 2042 becomes the team's core release.\nSpeaking in her first interview since taking the role, DICE's new General Manager Rebecka Coutaz told GamesIndustry.biz that the Battlefield franchise was the now core focus of the studio. In particular, Coutaz notes that DICE is committed to its long-term plans for blah shooter Battlefield 2042, with support expected to roll out for another three years at the very least. Asked about whether this meant Mirror's Edge or any other projects were off-the-table, Coutaz was very clear about DICE's directio…",

Speaking to Game Informer, he tackled the subject of Final Fantasy characters appearing in the series (or a lack thereof). Here's what Nomura had to say on the Kingdom Hearts Final Fantasy crossover situation.\nBasically, the reason the first game had a chunk of Final Fantasy characters in it is because Nomura and his team wanted to ease people into the world. He describes the Final Fantasy cast as \"lending a hand\" to get to know the Kingdom Hearts original creations. But once that whole universe got off the ground, they essentially served their purpose:\n\"Now, there are so ma…",

In the comics, Jane possessed all of the abilities of Thor during her time&nbsp;as the Goddess of Thunder. The only notable difference was her ability to manipulate Mjolnir with greater control and creativity (especially when throwing it) than her predecessors, so that's something the studio can certainly hone in and expand upon.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For more on Marvel's Avengers, check out our evolving list of <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/04/20/every-playable-character-in-marvels-avengers\" target=\"_blank\">every playable hero in the game</a>.</p>",

He's also flanked by two stormtroopers. He uses the Force in a variety of ways to mess with you and can block your shots. Your best bet is to attack him from afar with a sniper rifle or approach in a group.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>His lightsaber is a game-changer. You too can block shots with it, and it can also be thrown a decent distance to inflict big damage. Of course, you can swing it widely for melee strikes. We don't know how long Vader will be around or how he is influencing the story, but it's awesome to see him on the island dishing out punishment.
