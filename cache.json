          "description": "To be clear, I still think the best graphics card deal of Black Friday week is that RTX 4070 Super offer and oh no wait that one’s gone now. But even if hadn’t been ecommerced to death, there’d still be a way to get the upgraded ray tracing and DLSS 3 frame gen tools of the RTX 40 series for less cash still: plucky 1080p contender, the RTX 4060, whose deals are still very much available and kicking.\nIn the UK, the best available prices are for the MSI GeForce RTX Ventus 2X Black edition, which is the partner card I happen to own myself – and has become the effective go-to GPU for RPS game performance tests. Over in the US, meanwhile, the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4060 Gaming OC is the most affordable of all; it’s a chunkier design than that of the compact Ventus 2X, though that’s mainly just the tradeoff for having an extra fan. These cards were already on the cheaper end of the RTX 4060 spectrum, and now they’re £30 / $35 off in the sales. Bargain.\nRead more",

          "description": "As far as Black Friday deals go, the Logitech G502 Hero isn’t so much low-hanging fruit as it is a root vegetable. Every year, this damned multi-buttoned mouse goes on sale, and every year, I’m powerless to avoid writing about it. Can’t even be bothered to take a different header image photo. It’s partly your fault, you know. You like it too much.\nThis time it’s down from £80 to £26 in the UK (£27 outside the Bezos Empire), which isn’t quite an all-time low, but is pretty close – and a silly-good price for such a capable mouse in any case. Its US discount price of $35 ain’t half bad either, though I notice Amazon US is shouting louder about knocking the newer G502 X down from $80 for $45. That’s mostly a fine mouse as well, though I find its redesigned scroll wheel a bit too much on scratchy side. Of the two, I’d stick with the classic.\nRead more",

The first-person shooter, which is replete with satisfying explosions, gunfire, bullet ricochets, smashing glass, sparks, goo, blood spatters, dust, ice particles, smoke, flecks of plaster, and bad guys yelling at one another about how she's over there, may be described as noisy, both in the aural and visual sense of the word. Which is how we like it, you understand. This latest update to the early access shooter leans into that by layering on even more juicy shootFX.

Which stands for 'Action RPG'. But Zelda games are 'Action RPGs', which is a totally different genre that you could, if you felt like it, also shorten to 'ARPG'. So, to summarise: ARPGs and ARPGs are two different things, and both are Action RPGs. Got it? Great.\nIt’s because of this kerfuffle that I’m not exactly mad at Diablo boss Rod Fergusson recently suggesting that we just call games that are similar to Diablo 'Diablo-likes'. I just find it very funny that he’s the one saying it, in a bold faced act of admittedly very inconsequential linguistic colonialism that carries the unspoken connotation that something is \"like the game I make, but a bit crap\".\nRead more",

I'm sure for some this is riveting, but for me, it's something I tire of within seconds.\nAnd so it's with a heavy heart I say that Towers Of Aghasba suffers from the same starting gamut of sticks and stones.

          "description": "I've gone on record as not being a huge fan of the artstyle choices used in the new Warcraft I & II remasters. It's crisp and readable, sure, but I'm never exactly thrilled to see all the roughness of older sprites completely done away with, especially when I always felt some of that ruggedness was the point. The tendency of remasters to treat every characterful oddity as a blemish is a wider topic than the scope of this article, but one day, Bluepoint will remaster Bloodborne, and the world will feel my pain. \nAnyway. Nowadays, I'd say Blizzard - or, World Of Warcraft, at least - is pretty much synomous with a softer, more colorful approach to fantasy worlds. While I don't pine for a return to the more boobily ridiculous elements of Frank Frazetta's style, I do often wish that some of the more expressive, pained, and physically grounded elements of classic Sword And Sorcery art was a bit more common. I'm no art scholar, and there's undoubtedly a bit of tunnel vision of my part to this assertion, but as far as as pop culture goes: I see the Blizzard version of fantasy more than I see the Frazetta version, and I don't exactly love it. Same goes for the older, punkier, less uniform sci-fi art from things like 2000 AD and Warhammer 40,000. Edwin touched on some of this in his excellent Space Marine piece. \nAnyway, a valued RPS community member on the Discord shared an older bit of art by Blizzard's Chris Metzen, from the original Starcraft manual. I figured a few of you might enjoy seeing these older pieces, considering how much the overall look of their games has changed over the years. \nRead more",

If the likes of chairs, glasses, and chewing gum can be painted stealth-bomber black and prefixed with the G word, why not something that can actually get off its harshly angled bum and help pipe the games themselves into your head?\nThen again, maybe gaming earbuds were just waiting for their moment. Obviously the Nintendo Switch is the Nintendo Switch, but the rise of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally has driven desires for more portable (yet games-friendly) noise-deliverers 'round these PC parts as well. Thus, for another edition of Should You Bother With – the RPS column where a diaphragm of testing vibrates advice directly into the cochlea of understanding – let’s have a listen of these wireless buds and find out whether they’re a worthy replacement for your current go-to headphones.\nRead more",

I recently moved out from a London flat I'd rented for over a decade, for instance, and this has properly done a number on me. Being given my notice transformed the place from a transient pile of cadaverous lino and spasmodic plumbing into something mythical and unnerving – a whole chapter of my life completed and reduced to a piece of masonry in the rearview mirror, a relic I had been living in for years without quite realising.\nA few video game developers have investigated emotions like these by recreating their current and prior homes as virtual environments: places of mingled memory and invention, expressive of both nostalgia and surprise. At this year's Game Developer Conference in San Francisco, I interviewed a couple of teams who are coming at this premise with very different objectives, and somehow, meeting in the middle. One of the games in question is a work of daydreaming fondness, the other of comical anger.

          "description": "\"James, please don’t just make half your Black Friday deal posts about Steam Deck stuff again\", warns a steely-eyed Graham. \"I won’t\", I reply in sing-song while quietly adding pictures of the JSAUX ModCase to the CMS. That’s right, Amazon and a bunch of other retails have launched their BF sales a week early, which is annoying, unless you’re in the market for a Steam Deck case upgrade. If so, consider the compact, multifunctional ModCase, which is down to just £24 / $24. That makes for savings of 33% and 20% respectively, on what was already a nicely affordable alternative to the luxury of Dbrand’s similar Project Killswitch.\nRead more",

          "description": "The enemies of survival shooter Stalker 2 have a funny habit of showing up right behind you, like a panto villain with an AK-47. Far from being a premeditated ambush by intelligent AI-controlled soldiers, this is just a result of the game's janky spawns. Those botched encounters are unlike previous games, where roaming bands of factional murderfolk would patrol the radioactive wastes, seemingly according to their own whims. Back in the day, this wandering baddies feature was dubbed \"A-life\" by developers GSC Game World - basically a jargon word for the simulation of enemies that would lead to \"emergent\" moments of violence and conflict. It was promised as a feature in Stalker 2 but many players have noticed it seems to be absent. Over the weekend, GSC insisted the simulation is technically present in the sequel. It's just broken.\nRead more",

Even if it’s you’re first time hearing his name, you’ll be familiar with his fingerprints on some of the setting’s most defining artwork. He’s responsible for that iconic imagine of the emprah - the one the best shows off the dark irony of a such a wretched figure becoming an idol of worship. While the term ‘grimdark’ originates from 40k’s \"in the grim darkness of the far future…\" tagline, grimdark as an aesthetic is one Blanche pioneered. There’s even a style of miniature painting - Blanchitsu - named after him.\nBasically, even games that don’t use the 40k license owe an incredible amount to Blanche’s work. That’s not to mention his influence on the fantasy setting of the Total War: Warhammer series either. His piece Harry The Hammer was the cover for the first edition of Fantasy Battle - recently added to the strategy game as chaos hero Harold Hammerstorm. I could go on, and I might do so in a bit, but here’s the news: Trademark Films are making a documentary on Blanche’s work, starring Napoleon Dynamite actor Jon Heder. It’s called The Grim And The Dark: The Search For John Blanche, and it’s out next Spring. Here’s a trailer:\nRead more",

Speaking at the G-STAR Conference in Busan earlier this month, recently appointed chief executive officer Shams Jorjani confirmed that Arrowhead are looking into such collaborations, giving the example of refitting your dropship to look like one of Halo's Pelicans, or introducing the Zerg from Blizzard's Starcraft as an enemy faction. \nJorjani cautioned listeners, however, that these injections of third-party DNA need to look and feel appropriate to the setting. After all, if you start fecklessly chucking the Zerg, Chaos Space Marines or Fifth Element's, er, flying taxis into Helldivers 2, it might spoil the meticulous coherency of a game in which saluting protects you against lethal falls and some guy called Joel is running the universe. The funny part is that according to Jorjani, Arrowhead once envisaged a system that would get round the problem of inconsistency by essentially making third-party cosmetics, including whole map skins, visible only to players who have them enabled. To put that another way, Arrowhead once envisaged a system in which individual Helldivers would hallucinate other licenses.\n  \nRead more",

The game in question, Boktai: The Sun Is In Your Hand, is a Game Boy Advance title from 2003, in which you play a vampire-slaying gunslinger. The gun you're slinging is a \"solar-powered\" pistol, which you could charge up using a cartridge-mounted photometric sensor by physically standing in sunshine. This was 13 years before the launch of Pokemon Go. Sadly, Boktai's debut didn't result in city parks or rooftops being flooded by crowds of GBA-wielding undead killers. But it was a fun gimmick and the game itself is good enough to carry it - an isometric dungeon-crawler in which you have to find a vamp's coffin and drag it to the surface for purgation.\n Read more",

Or a lost episode of Ed Edd and Eddy, where a fourth older sibling (Eddie) acts on his murderous intent and engages in some slick FPSing. Either way, there's a demo out on Steam and despite being very short and limited, I am excited for its future.\nRead more",

Some try to sound badass, some might as well have been chosen by the owner panickedly looking around the room for something to name himself after, and all of them sound like they should be on the actor's wall in Toast of London.\nBecause your life partly depends on relieving slain foes of their belongings, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 encourages you to get up close and looty with these blokes, meaning you end up spending a lot of time reading goofy nicknames.

It was of many cats lying in the sun together outside a little church. I hadn't seen that volume of cats in my life, nor that volume together in one spot, all hanging out. Now, you too can live this magic: there's a demo of this upcoming sidescroller called Neko Odyssey on Steam, and it consists of you taking photos of cats for internet clout. It's nice!\nRead more",

Do you consider its brain-jacking of rando cityfolk for monster-hunting purposes a sad waste of potential? Perhaps you'll prefer RAM: Random Access Mayhem, out now in Steam early access, in which you're a fugitive AI hopping between warlike robot bodies in top-down view.\nYes, the subtitle involves both a colon and a dad joke, but the demo is entertaining - Nuclear Throne meets Ctrl Alt Ego, in short. The one major criticism I have after 20 minutes or so is that the flat pixelart perspective makes walls and walkable surfaces look interchangeable, and this feels more like a question of acclimatisation than a real complaint.\n Read more",

Mouthwashing begins with the same premise, albeit in a sci-fi setting. You're piloting a spaceship with a crew of five, clicking on its various controls to override the safety and turn the ship towards a nearby heap of space rock. You mean to crash.

Postup s aktualizací jádra sudo rpi-update je možné vynechat. Je ale možná potřeba ručně aktualizovat samotný bootloader (což dělá také rpi-update) pomocí sudo rpi-eeprom-update -a. Po restartu by se mělo objevit více NUMA uzlů a výkon by měl být vyšší.",

The benefit of hunting down and killing a Predator in your system is that you'll prevent it from not only attacking you but the other animals within it.

          "description": "In Bitlife, becoming a Hollywood Star is one of the most exciting career paths you can take. It’s all about fame, fortune, and living the glamorous life, but it’s not as easy as just getting discovered. To help you understand it more, here is everything you need to know about the Hollywood Star in Bitlife.\n\n\nWhat does the Hollywood Star do in Bitlife and how much does it cost?\n\n\nImage via Candywriter LLC\n\n\nThe basic idea for getting fame is working hard on the job, but with the Hollywood Star, you can instantly gain it. With this, you can earn a lot of money by doing a job that requires celebrity status. \n\n\nThe best part is that it's a one-time purchase, and you can get it for $10. However, the developers offer discounts of up to 50% on these items occasionally. You can toggle the Hollywood Star's power on or off through the Items Menu, under Collectibles. However, it only works for certain jobs. Here is the list of all of them:\n\n\n\nActor\n\n\nApp Developer\n\n\nWriter\n\n\nChef\n\n\nDJ\n\n\nMagician\n\n\nReporter\n\n\nModel\n\n\nSinger\n\n\nPolitician (starting at Governor)\n\n\nMusician\n\n\nAthlete\n\n\nCEO\n\n\n\nShould you buy Hollywood Star in Bitlife?\n\n\nSee, the idea of getting the Hollywood Star is to get instant fame, but you will still have to do the tasks on the job. Likewise, when applying for the job, you still need to meet its requirements – and only the selected ones can enjoy the perks of the Hollywood Star.\n\n\nSome of those, like Politician, Actor, and Singer will provide more fame in the job, so you won’t necessarily need Hollywood Star, as you can achieve the same fame with grind. Ultimately, if you don’t want to work and are willing to spend money, then go for the Hollywood Star. Otherwise, you can also achieve the same result by completing tasks in the game. \n\nThe post What does the Hollywood Star do in Bitlife appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Getting better in CS2 not only requires skills and talent but also a good internet connection. If you think you have a bad internet connection, then you must have come across the packet loss issue.\n\n\nIt’s one of those issues that can ruin your game, causing lag, stuttering, or even disconnects in the middle of a match. The good news is there are a few things you can do to fix it. To help you with that, here are all the possible fixes that you can do to tackle the packet loss issue in CS2.\n\n\nHow to fix packet loss in CS2\n\n\nImage via Valve\n\n\nInternet connection\n\n\nThe biggest culprit of packet loss is your internet connection. If you are using Wi-Fi, maybe try switching to the wired connection with an Ethernet cable, as it tends to be more stable. \n\n\nBut if you have to use Wi-Fi, try moving closer to your router for a stronger connection. If nothing works, try restarting your router.\n\n\nBandwidth\n\n\nAnother thing that can cause packet loss in CS2 is bandwidth hogging. Usually, if you or anyone who is using the same internet connection is streaming videos, downloading files, or using the internet heavily, it can cause packet loss. So, make sure to stop or pause those before queueing for a match.\n\n\nUpdate your network drivers\n\n\nAnother thing that can help you tackle packet loss is updating your network drivers. Usually, outdated or corrupted network drivers can cause connection issues. \n\n\nTo check for drivers, head to your device manager, find your network adapter and check if there are any driver updates available. Also, you can download the latest drivers directly from the manufacturer’s website.\n\n\nContact your ISP\n\n\nIf nothing else works, you should contact your Internet Service Provider (ISP). Some ISPs have routing problems that can cause packet loss. \n\nThe post How to fix packet loss in CS2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

By the way, if you plant many Pumpkins, they are a great way of making money as there's a lot of profit in selling these to Goofy. \n\n\nGinger can also be found in the Forgotten Lands. This time, it doesn't require your wallet. Look to the ground, and you'll find the ingredient planted in the ground. Look for a long green stalk poking out of the ground.

For the vegetable, you can use another Pumpkin or grow a crop that grows quickly like a Carrot from Goofy's Stall in the Peaceful Meadow. \n\n\nOnce you have all four ingredients, go to a cooking station like your house or Chez Remy. Throw all of them into the pot, and you'll have a lovely Pumpkin Soup in your possession. You can sell it for around 1,461 Star Coins (depending on the vegetable you choose) and eat the dish for 1,591 Energy.

Thankfully, you won't need any of the DLC like The Storybook Vale. \n\n\nScreenshots by Destructoid\n\n\nRun around the Forest of Valor (you can also find Emeralds here) and look for a blue flower growing from the grass. You don't want the bell-shaped flowers; the Blue Star Lilies have normal petals. \n\n\nYou'll be able to find around three or four of the flowers at one time. One respawns every 30 minutes, so it will take some time to craft the items you need, unfortunately. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nWhat can you craft with this flower?\n\n\nOne cute item you can make with the Blue Star Lily is a Blue Retro Portable Radio. You'll get the instructions on how to create it after picking up a Blue Star Lily. Collect the following materials and then head to a crafting table at your home or at Scrooge's shop. \n\n\n\n1 Blue Lily\n\n\n5 Softwood\n\n\n1 Iron Ingot\n\n\n\nYou can also craft Iron Ingot by collecting five Iron Ores and one Coal Ore, which you can get from mining nearby rocks. Once you have the Blue Retro Portable Radio made, you can place it as furniture inside your home. It will put on some familiar music if you interact with it.\n\nThe post Where to find Blue Star Lily in Disney Dreamlight Valley appeared first on Destructoid.",

The survey, conducted by Ipsos, highlights that the high cost of streaming services is a key driver behind this attitude.  Links between piracy and organized crime or malware, appear to be of less concern. \nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

          "description": "Castle Master, the haunting conclusion to the Freescape engine saga, is now ready for public testing!\nPrepare yourself for a perilous adventure as you lower the drawbridge to enter the Castle Master’s domain. Released in 1990 by Incentive Software, Castle Master became popular for its technical innovation and challenging gameplay. The game inspired countless 3D adventure titles, and the Freescape engine itself marked a technological milestone, enabling groundbreaking object interaction and spatial puzzles.\nNotably, Castle Master was one of the first games to let you choose to play as either a prince or a princess, offering a different experience depending on your choice.\nYour mission: rescue your twin, imprisoned within the eerie depths of Castle Eternity by the evil Magister. This sprawling, foreboding castle is filled with traps, monsters, and puzzles blocking your path. Gather items, unlock doors, and solve complex riddles as you navigate the labyrinthine halls and confront the dark forces within.\nThis modern reimplementation showcases enhanced graphics using OpenGL, with initial support for the DOS and ZX Spectrum releases. If you’re eager to embark on this dark journey, a playable demo is available to test your tenacity.\nTo participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.\nWill you brave the creepy corridors of Castle Eternity and free your sibling, or will you fall victim to the Magister’s curse and join his army of enslaved spirits? The adventure awaits!\n>",

          "description": "After seven months of intense work, we are ready to announce support for a few games based on qdEngine, developed by K-D Labs.\nThe work is based on the original sources published now under GPL, although the work started a bit earlier than that. The engine supports 14 games, five of which we are announcing support for. Most of these games were released in Russian; however, there were Lithuanian, Czech, and Polish releases. The support is announced for:\nWait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare, (Russian: Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца, Lithuanian: Na, palauk! Zuikio dainos, Czech: Jen počkej a Píseň pro zajíce)\nMask Show (Russian: Маски-шоу)\nMarvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки.

День рождения морской крысы, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Urodzinowe Śledztwo)\nOther games do work; however, we haven’t playtested them. You may find more information on our Wiki. Also, we are looking for the Lithuanian version of Little Longnose and Polish releases of Little Mice games and Wait for it! game. If you happen to have a copy, please contact sev.\nWe continue the active development so that support for other games will follow shortly. The primary constraint is playtesting.\nTo run these games, you need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any hiccups during your quests, please file them on our issue tracker.\n>",
