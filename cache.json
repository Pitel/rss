          "description": "Turn the Paige.\nThough plenty of Paper Mario fans are eagerly awaiting the return of one of the greatest games in the series at the time of writing, there’s another new game set in a papery world that we’d suggest you pay attention to. Newfangled Games’ Paper Trail is the debut release of the boutique London-based studio, and its smart mixture of creative puzzle design with gorgeous storybook visuals makes for a compelling puzzle experience. Paper Trail is a pretty simple game at heart, but it’s so fresh in its ideas and execution that it’ll stick around in your mind long after you’ve finished it.\nPaper Trail places you in the role of Paige, an intelligent girl living with her family in a quiet seaside village who has aspirations of going to school to become an astrophysicist. Her parents oppose her choice to go to college, however, leading to Paige running away from her family and home towards her goals. Along the way, she uses her ability to change reality to help strangers she encounters, who in turn provide her with companionship as she gets farther away from home. It’s a pretty simple premise, but it’s helped greatly by the voiced ‘journal entries’ as you travel between worlds, which also help flesh out Paige’s tragic backstory and motivations for choosing her vocation. It’s not exactly a ‘deep’ narrative, but it draws you in and lulls you into a sense of ease with its soft magical realism.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Nintendo's coffers have been spilling over throughout the Switch's cycle and it could have easily gone on an Embracer-style spending spree during the COVID boom years, but that's not its style. With Embracer Group now restructuring, the Swedish company's loss is Nintendo's gain.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Paper, un-jammed.\nPaper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door has been held as the standard for Mario RPGs for 20 years. It, alongside its N64 predecessor, captured what fans wanted from their turn-based, plumber-starring adventures – silly humour, epic adventures, fantastic combat, and charm. Purists often view the GameCube original as the end of the 'true' Paper Mario style – a little bit unfair, perhaps, when Super Paper Mario and The Origami King are both great, if undeniably different from that original formula.\nIt should be no surprise that the Switch remake of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door was celebrated upon its announcement. Even if you like other Paper Mario titles, it’s hard to argue that Thousand-Year Door wasn't a high point for the plumber, not just in the RPG space but in Mario’s wider canon. Two decades later, that still holds true, and now the best Mario RPG is finally more accessible.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The first Prison Architect allowed you to finesse every detail of a secure correctional facility, down to each cell and dog kennel.

A big man kills another big man with a gun but then - then! - a third big man kills that first big man with a rope. It's dramatic stuff. Well, a data-diving enthusiast of the CoDwars has discovered a cut ending from the original trilogy's closing chapter. It's a more downbeat and mysterious finale, featuring a shadowy figure whose identity is never revealed. Also, Captain Price, the hero of the franchise and aforementioned big man number three, drops his cigar with possibly mortal implications.\nRead more",

Dualshockers credit “a reliable source” with the information that “three new Total War games are currently in development,” and that “one of the three new projects is expected to be a Star Wars-themed Total War game.” There’s currently no further information beyond that, I’m afraid, although I’ve reached out to Creative Assembly for comment.\n \nRead more",

Well, scratch that August release, as now it's been shifted back to September instead! But hey, there's a demo coming out real soon that'll hopefully give us a better sense of what the game's like. I imagine it'll involve a lot of fighting spindly monsters, dying, and resurrecting at whatever object they've decided will be the equivalent of Dark Souls' bonfires. Likely something Leonardo da Vinci made or drew or invented. That man's stats were specced high.\nRead more",

          "description": "I've clocked up nearly 400 hours playing BioWare's big fantasy RPG Dragon Age: Inquisition, which is not a stat I'm particularly proud of. I'm not ashamed either, partly because, as has been identified by artist Corey Brickley, via the Maw, there's a lot of filler. Brickley has collated a list of suggested mods to slim down Dragon Age: Inquisition from a potentially 80 hours-long epic to a trim 40 hour story-focused romp, which means you might be able to play through it again in time for the launch of Dragon Age: Dreadwolf - which is a direct sequel to Inquisition.\nI find this list of mods interesting! It's a way to change the game quite substantially without exactly transforming it, and it's very in-keeping with my campaign to make games 60% smaller. Still, there's at least one item on there I'd push back on, but also this isn't really a new problem for Dragon Age as a series.\nRead more",

But given my aversion to their babification by the internet, it may be surprising that my chief complaint about Little Kitty, Big City is that the hats in it are largely not cute enough.

          "description": "Nic reckons Homeworld 3, the long-awaited spacefaring RTS, is mostly pretty good. Qualified hoorays for that, as well as for the fact that it doesn’t make especially mad demands of your hardware: besides netting a Steam Deck Playable badge from Valve, its minimum PC specs only list the likes of the Intel Core i5-6600 and Nvidia’s GTX 1060. Easily doable, for most aspiring galactic admirals.\nOnce a battle gets underway, however, Homeworld 3’s performance can start tanking, turning an initially smooth engagement into a more stutter-prone light show. The good news? You can more than double your framerates with a relatively small handful of graphics setting changes, even if some these (including the DLSS and FSR 2 upscalers) can be a tad inconsistent in their own right.\nRead more",

The interests of the game's creators have not so much leaked into this fictional world as they have been generously pumped in with an industrial hose. Even the visual novel's loading screens take the form of those two-second intermission panels that flash up to signal an anime's commercial break, complete with random characters announcing the game's name (\"Neurodiver!\"). In moments like that, the passion is endearing. But in other places, it is overwhelming. Neurodiver is obsessed with media in a way that often distracted me from the bright-eyed cyberpunk story it wants to tell.\nRead more",

He doesn't know me - of course he doesn't - and I don't know him. But for ten years I'd watch him at every opportunity and see him grow into one of the all-time greats. For me, his retirement wasn't only devastating in the sense he was a great ambassador for the sport: a positive soul, a good speaker, a hard worker. No, it also spelled the end of us being able to witness something impossible to replicate, a 'game' of badminton uniquely his.

          "description": "My evolving relationship with Vampire Therapist continues apace - much how protagonist Sam's acumen as an unlicensed therapist for the unsettled undead develops at speed. He's a vampire doing therapy for other vampires, while also undergoing therapy, as a vampire, from another therapist (who is a vampire). Vampire Therapist! I've been able to get to grips with a playable preview - I'd say I got my teeth into it, but I'm not that much of a hack fraud - which means I got to see some of the things that creative director Cyrus Nemati told me about in our interview in action. I remain optimistic that, on it's release on June 18th, Vampire Therapist can walk the tricky line it's drawn for itself.  \r\n\nIt's balancing on a knife point of humour, the supernatural, and sincerity about mental health, the latter using real cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT; the comments the first time I wrote about Vampire Therapist revealed a lot about our readership) concepts in consultation with licensed therapists. The preview only covered Sam's first meeting with his mentor, Andromachos, and the first client Sam treats himself - a doctor called Drayne, simultaneously self-loathing and self-aggrandising - but it gave a flavour of how the game plays. Rather than a sort of janky template on how to self-therapise, as I'd feared, when you're playing Vampire Therapist it operates more as a sort of language puzzle against different types of theatre kids.\nRead more",

But I've sampled enough to know that adding a \"Misery Mode\" to the game is sort of like upending a bucket of water over a drowning person. More misery in The Long Dark? Oh thank god, that's just what this notoriously easygoing wilderness adventure has been missing. And what's this, developers Hinterland are introducing a new predator, the Cougar, which will move into any area you're fond of and compete over territory. Finally, a bit of friction for what has previously been a stroll in the woods.\r\n\n\r\nIt's not all misery. In a first for The Long Dark, which has hitherto been a permadeath game that wipes your save between runs, the devs are working on an optional Cheat Death system. It's not as cheaty as it sounds, however. You can only return from the grave four times, and each time, you'll have to make unspecified trade-offs. The idea is to stop people backing up their saves and make failure more of an adventure or if you prefer, an agonisingly slow decline, rather than letting players avoid the consequences of their actions.\r\n \nRead more",

I think this has gotten worse (if that's the word?) with the increasingly popularity of BookTok, the book-centric community on TikTok. It's really mobilised young people towards reading (which is good) but in some cases drives a consumption for consumption's sake approach, where one must have read new books to talk about, one must take no breaths between reading, and one must read an astonishing number of books in the smallest amount of time possible (which I think is bad).\nRead more",

Helldivers 2, meanwhile, is a game in which people are as expendable as bullets, and the storytelling is deliberately brittle because it consists largely of clownish propaganda. Put the two sets of inspirations together, and what do you get? You get a headline, that's what. Beyond that, we can only dream.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Over the past several years we have seen AMD Ryzen processors being used for low-cost servers, budget web hosting platforms, game servers, and more. Since the Ryzen 5000 series we have seen the likes of ASRock Rack and Supermicro putting out interesting budget-friendly Ryzen servers and that has ramped up even more with AMD Ryzen 7000 series server performance being stellar thanks to AVX-512 and other improvements making it more practical for such workloads. AMD has now solidified its positioning for entry-level servers with the introduction of the EPYC 4004 series processors. The EPYC 4004 series is derived from the Ryzen 7000 series offerings to facilitate cost conscious server options and putting the Intel Xeon E-2400 series in the crosshairs. In this review is a look at the EPYC 4004 series along with benchmarks of nearly the entire EPYC 4004 product stack compared to Intel's current top-end Xeon E-2400 series processor, the Intel Xeon E-2488 Raptor Lake.",

However, as you do this, your verifying file integrity bar might freeze for some time, with no indicator of when it'll start again. \n\n\nHow to fix Wuthering Waves Verifying File Integrity bug\n\n\nContrary to how it seems, the main way to resolve Wuthering Waves' verifying file integrity bug is to wait for it to finish. Sometimes, this can take up to 30 minutes, especially on older devices. However, it will eventually complete the file verification process in most cases.\n\n\nMore often than not, when your verifying file integrity bar freezes, a visual error occurs rather than a verification issue. Despite the bar and percentage not moving, it's still completing the request in the background, and usually, it'll skyrocket after a few minutes. In the best situations, this only takes a minute or two, but it can take longer in some situations. Restarting your game or launcher resets your progress, which can make the issue repeat.\n\n\nThere are some exceptions to this. Occasionally, your game or launcher may be frozen, which causes your game to eventually crash. Although this situation is uncommon, it's not impossible. If this happens, you may have to restart the game, your PC, or your phone. Generally speaking, though, it's a visual error that just takes some patience to fix.\n\n\nIt's currently unknown whether Kuro Game Studio, the developers of Wuthering Waves, will implement hotfixes to resolve the verifying file integrity visual bug. For now, the main solution is to wait a few minutes for the issue to fix itself.\n\nThe post How to fix stuck Verifying File Integrity error in Wuthering Waves appeared first on Destructoid.",

This happens when you are using specific resolutions or monitor sizes that can cut off part of the launcher. Here is a Wuthering Waves Launcher too big fix so that you can click the download and install button.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHox to fix Wuthering Waves launcher too big\n\n\nThankfully this is pretty easy to remedy. You can fix the Wuthering Waves Launcher being too big by changing the DPI Scaling of the launcher so that it fits on your screen. Here is how to fix the big Wuthering Waves launcher:\n\n\n\nClose out of the launcher completely.\n\n\nRight-click on the Wuthering Waves Launcher icon on your desktop.\n\n\nClick on Properties.\n\n\nClick the Compatibility tab.\n\n\nSelect 'Change High DPI Settings'.\n\n\nCheck the box labeled High DPI Scaling override.\n\n\nSwitch to System and the launcher should automatically adjust to your screen size.\n\n\nClick Ok and your launcher size should no longer be too big!\n\n\n\nFor those playing on a different platform than the native PC Global Launcher, you can try switching the orientation on your device from landscape to portrait. This will allow you to see the Download button, and then you can switch back to landscape.\n\n\nIf you are playing on the Epic Games Store or Google Play Beta and have this issue, you can always consider switching to the native PC Global Launcher and trying the above fix which will work.\n\n\n\nThe post Wuthering Waves Launcher too big fix appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Popular online multiplayer games often have small blips and errors when they first launch, and in Wuthering Waves' case, one of the most prominent is the gateway connection timed-out bug. You'll go to log into the game, only to find a system notice message asking you to try again later. Here's how you can handle this particular error.\n\n\nHow to fix the Wuthering Waves Gateway Connection Timed Out bug\n\n\nBelow are some quick tips you can use when tackling Wuthering Waves' gateway connection timed-out error:\n\n\n\nRestart and relog from Wuthering Waves before reconnecting.\n\n\nVerify your game's installation files.\n\n\nWait until Wuthering Waves' servers settle down following its initial launch.\n\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nSometimes, a quick game restart can solve most of your problems, especially if it's a one-time error. However, in other cases, you may have to verify your game's files to make sure they are installed correctly, especially if you're encountering other errors like the Fatal Error bug along the way. If nothing else works, it may be a waiting game until the developers publicly address the issue.\n\n\nMore often than not, these issues are caused by Wuthering Waves' servers becoming overloaded, especially during its initial launch and major events. In these cases, you'll have to wait for them to relax before re-attempting to log into the server. \n\n\nIt can also be an unexpected server-side error that persists after the game's launch that the development team has to address. While they gave a few warnings for certain platforms, other errors can appear unexpectedly for the team to fix. If it continues well after the game's launch with no public updates, you can use places like the Wuthering Waves Twitter account and Discord server or contact their support email.\n\nThe post How to fix the Gateway Connection Timed Out error in Wuthering Waves appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Semi-automatic weapons often get overlooked by their fully automatic counterparts, yet the M16A4 deserves plenty of attention. \n\n\nThe M16A4 requires an abundance of skill and patience to perfect. Instead of firing and forgetting like other assault rifles, the M16A4's three-round-burst firing type eliminates any margin for error and forces players to be accurate with their shots. When perfected, it will become second nature to take down enemies in two bursts, but in the beginning, there will be plenty of instances where you get punished for missing a shot by fully automatic weapons. That persistence will eventually payoff, as the M16A4 is arguably one of the best weapons in XDefiant.\n\n\nBest M16A4 loadout in XDefiant \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\n\nBarrel: Rapid Fire \n\n\nFront Rail: Superlight Grip \n\n\nOptic: Reflex Sight \n\n\nRear Grip: Grip Tape \n\n\nStock: Padded Stock \n\n\n\nEvery second matters while using a burst weapon. The quicker you can aim down sight with the M16A4, the more effective it will be. With that in mind, our loadout focuses on improving ADS speed, rate of fire, sprint speed, and recoil recovery. This set of attachments slightly hinders vertical and horizontal recoil, but not enough to be worth worrying about.\n\n\nBest XDefiant faction for the M16A4\n\n\nChoosing a faction comes down to personal preference. Still, the Cleaners provide the best set of abilities to make the M16A4 flourish.  To start, the Incendiary Rounds kill enemies faster in short to medium-range engagements, which is perfect for the burst rifle, and the Firebomb ability is perfect for trying to clear off an objective on offense, or weaken an enemy to make them killable with one burst.\n\nThe post Best M16A4 loadout in XDefiant appeared first on Destructoid.",

Three of the more common XDefiant error codes are Bravo, Delta, and Foxtrot.

Each of these three error codes seem to occur with a number 01-10 following them, though the number doesn't seem to hold relevance.\n\n\n…",

          "description": "Battle royales dominate the first-person shooter genre, so some fans expect XDefiant to bite the bullet and follow the rest of the herd. \n\n\nIn 2017, H1Z1 sparked what would become a meteoric rise in battle royale popularity. Fortnite eventually took over that mantle, and then other studios entered the fray and put their unique spin on the genre to varying degrees of success. Seven years later, there is still a demand for more innovations to the tried-and-true formula, including calls for XDefiant to join in.  \n\n\nWill XDefiant have a battle royale mode?\n\n\nImage via Ubisoft \n\n\nIn a tweet on February 2, 2023, the XDefiant executive producer Mark Rubin seemed opposed the idea of adding a battle royale game mode to the title. \n\n\n\"We are solely focused on making a great and fun arena shooter. No BR. And we're not moving on to a new game after this. We are going to keep making this game better and better! That is all.\" \n\n\nUbisoft has a troubled history with battle royale projects. In August 2020, the publisher launched its first free-to-play battle royale title Hyper Scape. Ultimately, the title fell short of expectations and shut down in April 2022. That didn't stop Ubisoft from returning to the well, as there were allegedly at least a dozen battle royale games at various points of development at some point. It's unclear what happened to any of those projects, and it remains to be seen if Ubisoft has any plans to create another battle royale. \n\n\nYet when the new 6v6 arcade shooter XDefiant emerged, fans inevitably asked if this was Ubisoft potentially dipping its toe back into the battle royale genre. Albeit with the help of several supporting studios, Call of Duty proved that it's possible to create a 6v6 and battle royale experience under the same umbrella. The framework is there for Ubisoft to replicate, but for now, we currently just have XDefiant.\n\nThe post Will XDefiant have a battle royale mode? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "With two versions of Wuthering Wave's main character, the Rover, up for grabs at the start of the game, you might be wondering which one you should pick. \n\n\nMany gacha games will put players in this position as they will provide a male and female version of the character, and people will always want to know if there is any advantage between one or the other. In this guide, we will break it all down for you.\n\n\nIs there a difference between the male and female Rover?\n\n\nThere isn't any important difference between the male and female Rover. Their abilities and strengths are the same; they will use the same weapon and upgrade materials, and they will go through the story the same way. The Intimacy system that dictates your relationships with other characters will also remain the same, no matter what character you pick.\n\n\nThe difference between the male and female characters really boils down to things that can be determined by personal preference. Which character model do you prefer? Do you think the male or female voice actor is better? Do you typically just play as one or the other gender in your games? It honestly doesn't matter. \n\n\n\n\nThe only real difference between the two characters is their attack animations. I've embedded a comparison video above so you can have a good look at both characters as they move through their attacks. Personally, I prefer the female animations. There is just something very cool about the behind-the-back sword work that she does after some combos. \n\n\nIf you are curious about the other characters and how they stack up when compared to each other, be sure to check out our Tier List to find out who is worth chasing down and investing in for your party and who is better off for simple story missions.\n\nThe post Should you pick the male or female Rover in Wuthering Waves? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Netflix YouTube channel just released a teaser that finally reveals Liam Hemsworth in the role of Geralt of Rivia for the upcoming fourth season of The Witcher TV series.\n\n\n\n\nThe teaser only show's Geralt's back, his wolf school medallion, and then his bright face and yellowed eyes. Nothing about his appearance is a departure from the previous look, except for Liam's leaner physique. Some fans might take issue with it, but the costume crew certainly won't, as it will result in fewer costumes ripped apart by a Witcher that's just too buff for them to handle.\n\n\nYou could perhaps say that Liam Hemsworth's Geralt looks more apprehensive than confident — unlike Henry Cavill's take on the character. That might be his choice for the role, or a look imbued by reality as he knows he has big shoes to fill after Henry Cavill's unexpected firing from the show.\n\n\nMy take? Well, he pulls off the Geralt look, and certainly looks much better than Henry Cavill did in that cheap-ass wig from Netflix's make-up test that somehow ended up as the character's big reveal. Yes, we will never forget.\n\n\n\n\nThe big question, I'm afraid, is not whether Hemsworth will look and act the part, but whether he'll go for a new take on the character, or try to copy Cavill's outing. Sadly, I believe fans might not be too keen on either. Still, I believe Liam Hemsworth is deserving of a chance, simply for having had the guts to take on the role.\n\n\nThe Witcher's fourth season still doesn't have a release date, but you can play The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and on PC.\n\nThe post Here’s a look at Liam Hemsworth’s Geralt in The Witcher Season 4 appeared first on Destructoid.",

You should be packing some excellent gear and be at or above level 100 to take on Echo of Andariel. But before you can even attempt it, you’re going to need how to get where she can be summoned: Hanged Man’s Hall.\n\n\nGetting right into the meat of what you need to know, the Hanged Man’s Hall lair is found East of Tarsarak in Kehjistan. It’s not all that far. Here’s a picture:\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nWorking backwards, in order to summon the Echo of Andariel, you’re going to need two Pincushioned Dolls and two Sandscorched Shackles. Pincushioned Dolls are gained from The Beast in the Ice and Sandscorched Shackles are dropped by Lord Zir. These are endgame bosses if that isn’t already clear. You need to fight them in World Tier 4.\n\n\nYou’ve probably learned this, but the Pincushioned Dolls and Sanscorched Shackles you use in the summon will be consumed.\n\n\nAndariel is pretty analogous to her brother Duriel. That’s in terms of power level, but also in the loot that gets dropped.\n\n\nAlso note that you can now fight Tormented versions of the bosses, if you feel prepared. These are level 200 versions that have better chances at rare loot. In order to summon the tormented version, you need Stygian Stones, as well as six Sandsorched Shackles and six Pincushioned Dolls.

          "description": "We’ve known since October 2022 that Season 3 of Netflix’s The Witcher would be actor Henry Cavill’s last as Geralt of Rivia and that Liam Hemsworth would don the silvery mane going forward. Today, Netflix released the first teaser trailer for Season 4 giving fans their first look at Hemsworth in the role.\n\n\nUnfortunately, Hemsworth doesn’t speak in the brief clip, so we still don’t know how his Geralt voice compares to Cavill’s (or the games, for that matter). But he definitely doesn’t look out of place as the White Wolf and, hopefully, won’t be too much of a distraction in this new season.\nSeason 4 is currently in production in the UK and will be filmed back-to-back with Season 5, which will also be the show's finale. It has no release date but is speculated to premiere in 2025. These last two seasons will cover the three remaining Witcher books: Baptism of Fire, The Tower of the Swallow, and Lady of the Lake. The returning cast includes Anya Chalotra (Yennifer) and Freya Allan (Ciri). \nFor more on The Witcher games, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt got its official PC mod tools this week.

          "description": "Crytek has announced the release date for Hunt: Showdown’s new-gen update, which will also conclude support for the current console versions. This update was first announced last September and will essentially force last-gen players to migrate to current consoles to continue playing the popular shooter. \nIn a developer update, general manager David Fifield announced that the CryEngine 5.11 Update will go live on August 15. This update is treated as a “significant relaunch” that brings native PS5/Xbox Series X/S support along with a host of technical improvements. However, it also means the PS4 and Xbox One versions will become unplayable.\nThat means these players must upgrade to current hardware to continue playing their copies of the game. Crytek assures these players that if they decide to upgrade, player accounts, entitlements, and all owned DLC will transfer to the new-gen version for no extra cost. \n\n\nIn addition to technical improvements, the 5.11 Update also introduces a new map and biome. In the months leading to 5.11’s launch, Crytek plans to address community and survey feedback. That includes improved reporting systems to address cheating and toxic player behavior, design reworks tackling hunter revival, health chunks, restorations, burning down hunters, and reducing stalemates. The game is also getting a new user interface, and Crytek will continue evolving the game's recruitment and prestige progression requirements. \nHunt: Showdown first launched for Xbox and PC in 2019, with the PS4 version arriving in 2020. The PvPvE first-person shooter is set in 1865 Louisiana as players, either alone or with two or three friends, hunt supernatural bounties in the bayou while fending off other player-controlled bounty hunters. \nFor more on Crytek, you can read about the studio's next big project, Crysis 4.",

          "description": "Five Nights At Freddy’s 2, the sequel to the 2023 film adaptation of the popular horror game, has a premiere date. Freddy Fazbear and friends will return to the big screen on December 5, 2025.\nAs reported by Variety, Blumhouse Productions announced the date alongside a slate of other upcoming films, including M3GAN 2.0 and The Black Phone 2. It's not surprising to see Five Nights At Freddy’s getting a follow-up. It simultaneously premiered in theaters and on Peacock on October 27, 2023, and still managed to be a massive box office success. Grossing $297 million globally, it became the year's highest-grossing horror film, Blumhouse’s highest-grossing film ever, and the most-watched movie on Peacock for five straight days. \nThe tagline for Five Nights At Freddy's 2 reads, \"Anyone can survive five nights. This time, there will be no second chances.\" The sequel’s cast has not been announced, but the original starred Josh Hutchinson and included Matthew Lillard, Elizabeth Lail, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Piper Rubio. Director Emma Tammi is returning to direct the sequel, with FNAF creator Scott Cawthorn and Blumhouse founder Jason Blum once again assuming producer roles. \nFNAF 2 won't be the only video game film arriving in 2025. Mortal Kombat 2, the sequel to the 2021 reboot film, was recently confirmed to release in October of that year.",

Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days.

But it seems like the fallout from this recent boom in popularity hasn't died down quite yet. Thanks to a teaser shared on Fortnite's official social media pages, we know that Fallout will be coming to Fortnite pretty soon\npic.twitter.com/AKjFXVnHST\nMay 17, 2024\nThe teaser image shows power armor in a cloud of orange dust, accompanied by what appears to be some sort of industrial building. Other than that, there's not much to go on, but we can make educated guesses. For one, Fortnite's current season will end on May 24, so this is the perfect time to tease the skins that might be coming in the next battle pass. And if it's anything like the recent Avatar: The Last Airbender and Star Wars crossovers, we might see Fallout-themed mechanics or areas appear on the battle royale map itself.\nIt will almost certainly involve some sort of cosmetic pack as well, which could include characters from the games, the Amazon Prime show, or both. Thanks to the teaser, we know power armor will be making an appearance, but it's unclear whether it will be an item to equip in-game or a skin that can be unlocked or purchased.\nFor more Fortnite news, read about its recent crossover with Billie Eilish, its decision to allow players to block certain emotes, and its huge and mysterious collaboration with Disney.\nWhat are you hoping to see included in this crossover?

          "description": "Microsoft is reportedly planning to launch this year's Call of Duty on its Xbox Game Pass subscription service, according to The Wall Stree Journal. This follows reports in previous weeks indicating Microsoft and Xbox were mulling over whether or not to launch the next iteration in the franchise on Game Pass, out of fear it might hurt sales. \nAfter acquiring Activision Blizzard for a colossal $69 billion last year, fans and analysts have speculated about how Microsoft will handle the Call of Duty franchise moving forward. It will obviously be a big draw for Xbox Game Pass, pulling in new subscribers, but most every year, the new Call of Duty is the best-selling game of the year – save for last year, where Hogwarts Legacy took that crown – and a Game Pass launch could affect those sales numbers. \n\n\nHowever, this new report from The Wall Street Journal seemingly clears the air around that topic. \n\"Microsoft plans a major shake up of its video game sales strategy by releasing the coming installment of Call of Duty to its subscription service instead of the longtime, lucrative approach of only selling it a la carte,\" the story reads. \nOf course, things could change so we'll see what happens. It's likely we'll be learning what the next Call of Duty game is next month as part of the gaming showcase summer that includes Summer Game Fest, Ubisoft Forward, and an Xbox Games Showcase followed by a secret direct that is probably focused on Call of Duty.\n[Source: The Wall Street Journal]\nWhat setting do you hope the next Call of Duty takes place in?

          "description": "2K will reveal the next iteration of one of its biggest franchises at Summer Game Fest. Fans online are already speculating what it could be, considering some of 2K's biggest franchises are prime for a new game. \nAs for when to expect this new game, the official SGF X (formerly Twitter) account says it will be announced on June 7, during the Summer Game Fest livestream that begins at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET. That's less than a month away so we don't have to speculate too long on what this mystery iteration could be. \n2K plans to reveal the next iteration in one of 2K's biggest and most beloved franchises at @SummerGameFest on Friday, June 7. pic.twitter.com/1vyFXE2N4z\nMay 16, 2024\nWhile there are plenty of 2K franchises that fit the bill, our eyes are on three franchises: Borderlands, Mafia, and BioShock. \nThe last mainline Borderlands entry – Borderlands 3 – hit PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in 2019, and with the live-action Borderlands movie hitting theaters this August, a new game would make sense. However, we did just get New Tales From The Borderlands in 2022, if you're looking for something to play through in that universe. \nOn the Mafia front, the last mainline entry was Mafia III in 2016, although 2K released Mafia: Definitive Edition – a remake – in 2020. And we know the next Mafia game is in development, too, so it might be time for an announcement. \nBioShock has been dormant since BioShock Infinite in 2013, unless you count the 2016 remasters, and we know 2K created Cloud Chamber in 2019 to work on the next entry in the franchise. It's been almost five years since then, so SGF seems like a great moment to announce the next BioShock. Speaking of, here's what we want in a BioShock 4. \nSGF returns to Los Angeles next month, with the live showcase happening on June 7.

While the launch seemed more in reach now that we’re nearly midway through 2024, it appears we’ll have to wait another full year before playing it.\nPublisher Take-Two released its 2024 year-end financial report today (thanks, PC Gamer), in which it states that Rockstar is targeting a Fall 2025 release window for GTA VI. This timing is reiterated in a calendar of the publisher’s upcoming releases, posted below.\nRegarding GTA VI, Take-Two states, “We are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase.” The game is slated to release for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. A PC version has yet to be mentioned. \nGrand Theft Auto VI takes players to a modern-day Vice City (the franchise's parody of Miami, FL) and stars two protagonists, a female inmate named Lucia and her still-unnamed criminal male partner. To say anticipation is high would be an understatement; the premiere trailer garnered over 100 million views in only 24 hours, breaking a YouTube record. \nAs we continue the long wait for Grand Theft Auto VI’s launch, check out our video of Game Informer’s two resident Florida Men reacting to the debut trailer.

It's a fantastic game that should be welcomed with open arms as it makes its way to a new platform, but we were specifically curious about how it performs on Steam Deck. The game is not Steam Deck verified primarily because certain features are not supported on Valve's handheld, or other comparable mobile PC game platforms. However, the offline content (the single-player campaign and the expansion) has been specifically adjusted to play well on Steam Deck. You can read port studio Nixxes Software explanation here. And spending a little time with the game shows that the single-player campaign does, in fact, play well on Steam Deck. It's not without its shortcomings – a high-end PC or a PlayStation 5 are still the best ways to play the game – but Steam Deck appears to be a great way to play the game if that's your only option or you want a portable version.\nYou can check out some gameplay with commentary from myself and Wesley LeBlanc below.\n\n\nHead to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

          "description": "Activision, the developer-publisher Microsoft and Xbox purchased for $69 billion last year, has formed a new studio called Elsewhere Entertainment, and it is developing a new \"narrative-based and genre-defining AAA franchise.\" The studio is based in Warsaw, Poland, and, according to a report from IGN, it is not working on a Call of Duty-related project. \nThis studio, which has been formed behind-the-scenes before today's public unveiling, arrives roughly one week after Xbox closed four Bethesda studios, including Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks and Redfall team Arkane Austin. While the company has yet to publicly address the closures directly, Xbox president Sarah Bond said in an interview that the closures were about keeping the business healthy in the long-term. It's why news of this new studio might be surprising, given one week ago, the parent company of Activision was closing studios to cut costs. \n\n\n\"Built from the ground up, Elsewhere Entertainment is a premier and standalone studio dedicated to establishing an environment that inspires bold and diverse ideas,\" a blog post reads. \"The team's underlying mission encourages everyone to explore and collaborate creatively to craft a franchise with an enduring legacy that resonates far beyond games. [The] new studio has full access to Activision's resources and tools as it continues to increase production and development. \n\"Elsewhere is opening its search for best-in-class talent from across the industry and around the world to help create a state-of-the-art and next generation gaming experience.\" \nElsewhere is currently made up of developers with experience working on franchises like The Last of Us, Uncharted, The Witcher, Cyberpunk 2077, Destiny, Tom Clancy's The Division, and Far Cry. \nWhat kind of game do you hope Elsewhere makes?

The game has only been available in PC Early Access since April 26, meaning it achieved this milestone in only three weeks.\nPublisher Hooded Horse announced the sales account for Steam, Epic, GOG, and the Microsoft Store (where Manor Lords is also playable through PC Game Pass). The game quickly caught fire, selling 1 million copies a day after launch. Since then, Manor Lords has enjoyed a consistently high concurrent player count, peaking at 173,000 on Steam in its first weekend.  \n\n\nManor Lords is being developed by Slavic Games and puts players in the shoes of a medieval lord tasked with building and growing a city. Players manage their city’s community, infrastructure, economy, and defense/expansion, the latter of which unfold as large-scale tactical battles. The intricate social and production systems combined with an ever-changing world (complete with seasonal and weather changes) result in an organic metropolis that players have taken to in a big way. \nManor Lords joins Early Access hits this year, such as Palworld and Hades II. The game’s 1.0 launch is currently up in the air as the game continues to change and improve based on player feedback. It’s off to a great start, though, and we’re curious to see how it evolves throughout its EA period.",

The company did so after word online spread that Shadows requires a mandatory online connection to play the game. \nFollowing the reveal of Shadows yesterday, which showcased the dual samurai and shinobi protagonists we'll be controlling in 16th-century feudal Japan, people noticed wording in preorder listings and elsewhere that seemingly pointed to the game requiring an always-online connection. This frustrated fans of the series, especially given Shadows, like its recent predecessors, is a single-player game. However, that's not the case and Ubisoft released a statement today to clear the air. \n\n\n\"Hey everyone, we wanted to share some of the early information on the upcoming launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows, following some questions we've noticed in the community,\" the statement reads. \"Assassin's Creed Shadows will not require a mandatory connection at all times. An online connection will be needed to install the game, but you will be able to play the entire journey offline, and explore Japan without any online connection. \n\n\"We are super excited to bring Assassin's Creed to Feudal Japan on November 15 when the game releases, and we cannot wait to show you more along the way.\" \n\nAs you can see, it's clear Shadows is a game you can play offline, but only after connecting to the internet once to actually install the RPG. \nAssassin's Creed Shadows hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Amazon Luna, PC (via the Ubisoft Store and Epic Games Store), and Mac (with Apple silicon via the Mac App Store) on November 15.\nFor more, check out what we learned yesterday during the Shadows reveal, and then read Game Informer's ranking of the entire Assassin's Creed series.\nHow do you feel about needing internet to install Assassin's Creed Shadows?

          "description": "Ubisoft has canceled The Division Heartland. First announced in 2021, the game was a free-to-play spin-off of The Division franchise developed by Red Storm Studio.\nUbisoft revealed the cancelation in an earnings report, stating,\n“As part of Ubisoft’s efforts to streamline its operations and adapt to evolving market trends, there have been further reorganizations within the Global Publishing teams, both at the APAC region, that is not organized into three engagement hubs, and at the central level. Additionally, in line with the increased selectivity of its investments, Ubisoft has decided to stop development on The Division Heartland and has redeployed resources to bigger opportunities such as XDefiant and Rainbow Six.”\n\n\nThe Division Heartland had been quiet for some time after its reveal, including being delayed. It eventually resurfaced with closed beta tests, but scarce updates on its existence caused doubt and confusion among fans. The game was billed as a PvEvP survival action experience with players controlling a Division agent tasked with protecting a small town from enemy factions and chemical contamination. \nDespite the cancellation, we know it doesn't mean the end of the franchise. Ubisoft announced The Division 3 last September, with series creator Massive Entertainment back at the helm. That game currently has no release window. \nHeartland joins an expanding graveyard of canceled Ubisoft projects over the past few years. In January 2023, the publisher canceled its upcoming team-based arena battler Project Q and three other games in development. In 2022, the battle royale Ghost Recon Frontline, Splinter Cell VR, and two unannounced games were also axed. An unannounced sequel to Immortals Fenix Rising was also reportedly scrapped last July.",

In this rare interview, we ask Logan how he entered the world of voice acting, how he joined Supergiant Games, and which characters are his favorites to play (and which he'd want to redo). \nGame Informer: When did you first discover that you were good at creating or imitating voices?\nLogan Cunningham: I don't think there was ever a moment that I discovered that. I always did that. From when I was a kid, my brother and I, we would record stupid little...…",

          "description": "Amazon has ordered a new Tomb Raider TV series to production, and it will be written and produced by Fleabag star and writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who also starred in last year's Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. Like Amazon's Fallout series, this Tomb Raider show will premiere exclusively on Prime Video to more than 240 countries and territories around the world. \nThis series order arrives as part of a larger deal between Amazon MGM Studios and Tomb Raider reboot developer Crystal Dynamics, which is currently working on a new Tomb Raider game in Unreal Engine 5. In December of 2022, we learned Amazon Games will publish that in-development Tomb Raider game, which Amazon describes as a \"single-player, narrative-driven adventure that will add a new chapter to Lara Croft's story in the Tomb Raider series.\" \n\"With great IP, the possibilities are endless,\" Amazon Games vice president Christoph Hartmann writes in a press release. \"The richness and depth of the fiction allows the Tomb Raider series from Prime Video and the video game from Amazon Games to tell separate stories about Lara Croft's adventures. We're honored that Crystal Dynamics has entrusted Amazon with this iconic franchise, and we're looking forward to seeing where this collaboration takes us.\" \nThis is the second upcoming TV adaptation to star the iconic treasure hunter. Netflix's animated series Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft, starring Haley Atwell, is set to premiere sometime this year. That particular show is set within the continuity of Crystal Dynamic's reboot trilogy, taking place after the events of Shadow of the Tomb Raider. \nIf you're curious about Crystal Dynamics' recent Tomb Raider reboot, you can pick up Tomb Raider: Game of the Year Edition on PC via GOG for free if you're an Amazon Prime member throughout May.

Backwards-compatible with the entirety of the 5th edition of the game, the new books are nonetheless a big new step forward for the game, reflecting a decade of iteration and evolution as the game has exploded in popularity.\nThe books aren’t far off.

          "description": "Sony Interactive Entertainment has revealed in its latest financial earnings report it sold 20.8 million PlayStation 5 units in the fiscal year that ended on March 31. In doing so, Sony sold more than any fiscal year since the console's launch in November 2020. However, despite that achievement, Sony still fell short of its original PS5 sales target for this year, missing it by more than 4 million units. \nOriginally targeting 25 million units for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, Sony sold 20.8 million, bringing the grand total up to 59 million, despite the 4 million units miss. As noted by VideoGamesChronicle, however, Sony revised that 25 million unit target in February to just 21 million; it still didn't hit that target, though, just narrowly missing the mark. \n\n\nAt 59 million units, the PS5 is just behind the PlayStation 4's 60 million units at the same point in its life cycle. However, Tokyo-based video game analyst Serkan Toto told VGC that 20.8 million units sold is likely going to remain the peak for the PS5, and that this number would have been much lower if not for the release of Helldivers 2 in February, which is PlayStation's fastest-selling game ever after selling 12 million copies in 12 weeks. \nOn the earnings call, Sony told investors to expect gaming sales to decrease in the fiscal year that just began (and ends March of next year) due to an expected decrease in console sales. There are also no major games from existing franchises releasing between now and then, according to the company. However, Sony says it still plans to release Concord, the new multiplayer online shooter IP from Firewalk Studios coming to PS5 and PC, this year. \nFor more about PlayStation, read about how Hermen Hulst and Hideaki Nishino have been named dual CEOs of the company, and then read Game Informer's Stellar Blade review.

They’re joined by executive producer Grant Rodiek, an 18-year veteran of Maxis Studios and former producer/director on several entries of The Sims. In addition to them, the small team currently consists of six other designers.\n\n\nThe company’s debut game will be a next-gen life sim that, according to the press release, “emphasizes player-driven narratives, allowing communities to share memorable moments that grow out of the creativity of players themselves.” \n“The best stories in games are written by the players,” said Solomon in the press release. “At Midsummer we’re making a life sim focused on the drama of modern life, where our players will write meaningful stories just by playing, and then share those stories with the world.”\nMidsummer has secured a $6 million investment with several partners and is focused on growing a sustainable studio that values the health and happiness of its employees.",

It achieved this title after crossing 12 million copies sold in 12 weeks, beating out the record previously held by God of War Ragnarök, which sold 11 million copies in 10 weeks, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. \nDeveloper Arrowhead Game Studios' live-service multiplayer shooter sequel hit PlayStation 5 on February 8, with a simultaneous PC launch that same day, which is new for PlayStation. Its usual PC strategy sees PlayStation games launching on PC years after the game's console release – Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut is only just now coming to PC this month, for example. It seems launching on PC day-and-date with PS5 was the right call, though, as Helldivers 2 is now a bonafide hit for PlayStation. \n\n\nArrowhead Game Studios CEO Johan Pilestedt celebrated the news, noting there are more Helldivers 2 players than Swedes (the studio is based in Stockholm, Sweden) while thanking players for helping the team and PlayStation reach this achievement. \nAs announced in the Sony earnings call, we have sold over 12M units!\n@Helldivers2. A massive thank you to the community for your support,…\nMay 14, 2024\nNotably, Arrowhead Game Studios is independent – PlayStation published Helldivers 2 as a PS5 console exclusive, in a way previously referred to as second-party. However, given acquisitions are happening more and more this generation, it wouldn't be surprising if PlayStation attempted to bring Arrowhead Game Studios under the first-party umbrella. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Helldivers 2 review, and then read about how PlayStation recently walked back its Helldivers 2 PlayStation Network changes. \n[Source: VideoGamesChronicle]\nAre you one of the 12 million Helldivers 2 players?
