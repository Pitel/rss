It's a risky manoeuvre, adding a completely new mechanic like this to such a well-loved and heavily scrutinised franchise but, we're pleased to report, the Spanish developer has handed in a phenomenal new entry in the series that we just cannot stop playing. Metroid Dread is fantastic.\nOf course, one of the most exciting things in the build up to this brand new outing for Samus Aran has been that it's the first game we're getting a chance to play on Nintendo's fancy new OLED Switch, and we really can't think of a better title with which to introduce that amazing screen. This is a properly gorgeous adventure, with each of the various biomes of the planet ZDR that you puzzle and blast your way through coming with its own with unique and wonderfully detailed enemy types, flora and fauna, some truly stunning lighting effects and other fancy graphical bells and whistles.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

But on the surface it's a totally different story.\nEA and Dice made a big deal of the game's weather and I was like, \"Yeah, it rains all the time here too, heh\", but you know what? The way these battlefields chop and change when storms roll in really do make a huge difference when you're there with your boots on the ground.\nRead more",

          "description": "Where can you find Saltpeter in New World? In New World, Saltpeter is used to craft gunpowder, which in turn is a key component in crafting musket cartridges. Depending on your chosen character build and the weapons you favour, this could be an absolutely essential resource for you. But exploring Aeternum in search of a specific resource can be an intimidating prospect due to the sheer size of the island, so we've put together this guide to help you find the best Saltpeter spawn locations.\nFortunately, it's easy to predict where Saltpeter is going to spawn in New World. Unlike some other resources, Saltpeter isn't native to any particular region of the map. Instead, Saltpeter Ore nodes spawn in caves across Aeternum. Caves in New World tend to cluster around the coast, as you might expect, but you can find them inland as well, particularly at higher elevations.\nThe only real drawback to finding Saltpeter once you're inside the caves is that it looks quite a bit like any other rock. Saltpeter Ore is often slightly darker in color than its surroundings, and protrudes from the floor a bit more, but it's not hugely obvious. However, the good news is that within the confines of a cave, you should see the interaction text identifying Saltpeter appear on-screen if there's any nearby.\n Read more",

It can be overwhelming looking for resources on Aeternum, simply because there's just so much flora and fauna knocking about (and so many other players looking for the same things). Read on for everything you need to know about where Fronded Petalcaps spawn so that you can narrow your search.\nFronded Petalcaps have a few things going for them in the noticeability department. They are quite large, are a more luminous shade of green than most of the other plants around them, and overall look quite pleasingly like giant artichokes.\nThe Petalcap is native to the Windsward region of Aeternum, which is a conveniently central location from the very early stages of the game, since it's right in the middle of all four starting zones. Within Windsward, Fronded Petalcaps are fairly common, sprouting up in any area that could be described as remotely verdant, whether it's an open field or a more enclosed forested area. Basically, unless you're in a dry or coastal part of the region, there's likely to be some Fronded Petalcaps relatively close by.\n Read more",

If I start the round by protecting my engineer with Karl’s shield, then he won’t be blown to pieces by Deathblow’s rocket at the six second mark.

Then I can wrap around, finish off the Deathblow before he turns his rocket spam on the second objective, place a second shield on MY flanking zippy boy just in case he runs into trouble next loop, then finally fire some lasers at the first objective to counterbalance any extra enemy damage it might take in either the future or the past.

Tor, the conical peak that sits among the waves of a rambunctious ocean, broadcasts a clear signal across the stars, like the DJ of a mystical pirate radio station. Miraculously - or inevitably, depending on your attitude to prophecy - somebody answers. A species not entirely unlike humanity leaves behind a failing orb not entirely unlike Earth, and makes an impossible journey out of faith and desperation to the source of the Hymnwave. Jett: The Far Shore’s protagonist, Mei, is one of the first scouts to step onto the shore: “A mystic among them,” as predicted by a soothsayer long ago.\nOnce there, the newcomers find confirmation of their wyldest dreams, but the planet soon turns against them. Equipment is damaged or taken by local fauna, and the weather pins the would-be explorers in place. Tor seems to at once welcome its guests and push them away, as if at odds with itself. Though the Hymnwave has hummed through the ether for many years, it’s clear the planet is not yet of one mind.\nRead more",

In hindsight, it seems obvious that these two worlds would eventually collide in Remedy's newly established Wake-iverse - such is their shared love of shadowy, flying objects - but back in the dark days of 2010, little did we know that Remedy's tortured horror writer would be making such a big comeback eleven years later. \nWell, at least he is over on consoles. While the original Alan Wake had a brief, year-long holiday from Steam in 2017 due to the expiration of its music licences, PC folks have been able to play Remedy's cult classic shooter more or less uninterrupted since its release in 2012. Alan Wake Remastered, however, marks the first time it's ever come to PlayStation (it having been an Xbox console exclusive all these years), and its spruced up character models, higher frame rates and 4K texture packs feel very much intended to get PS4 and PS5 players up to speed on this old-but-new figure in Jesse's life than us on PC. Indeed, when there's still a perfectly good version of Alan Wake sitting right there on Steam for less than half the cost of this new remaster, you're probably better off playing the original than stumping up the cash for this latest nip and polygon tuck.\nRead more",

At 20GB-odd, The Market Of Light is a hefty download for its 15-20 run-time, but this freeform exploration game is absolutely worth a look if your PC meets its surprisingly reasonable tech requirements - especially if you're a fan of games that feature cooking.

          "description": "Square Enix today announced a release date of March 18th, 2022 for Stranger Of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin, the curious action-RPG spin-off made by the studio behind Nioh, Team Ninja. A new trailer is here too and I have to say it looks more Final Fantasy-y and less less ha-ha-hilariously edgy than June's announcement trailer. It still looks plenty edgy, mind: watch out for the poor wee cactrot which gets... turned into a blood crystal and exploded?\nRead more",

So it's grand to hear from Bungie's new accessibility initiative that yep, they're planning to add some sort of accessibility option enabling automatic fire. In some way.\nRead more",

Genshin Impact’s Serenitea Pot system grants you the ability to decorate your own realm with characters, furniture, plants, rocks, and even pets. Some players have carefully crafted gardens with elegantly decorated houses. Other players have simply used their teapots to trap Venti in an empty room filled with animals — whatever you want to do with your house, we can’t judge.\nWhether you haven’t unlocked the housing system yet or you’re looking for ways to improve your Serenitea Pot, this guide will show you everything you need, including unlocking housing, placing characters, choosing a layout, getting furniture, and increasing your Trust Rank and Adeptal Energy. \nRead more",

Also, Nate has a great Cavern Of Lies that is Star Wars themed, and does indeed give us a terrible fright.\nDigressions this week are a big discussion on Matthew's tooth situation, and a semi-argument about what planetary circumstances would be enough for me to agree to go into space (e.g. planet covered in really nice soup).

V roce 2022 bude totiž konference poprvé v hybridním formátu: tedy fyzicky na FIT VUT a zároveň v online prostředí. Díky tomu si mohou přednášející sami zvolit formát své přednášky a prezentovat prakticky odkudkoliv. Kromě nového formátu nabídne DevConf také novou podobu tématických okruhů, které se více zaměří na aktuální trendy v IT průmyslu. Pokud chcete přispět do programu svou vlastní přednáškou nebo workshopem, čas na přihlášení máte do 24. října prostřednictvím online formuláře. Nevíte s čím se přihlásit? Nechte se inspirovat loňským programem a nahrávkami.\r\nO konferenci\r\nDevConf.CZ začal jako interní konference společnosti Red Hat za účelem sdílení zkušeností a osvědčených postupů mezi kolegy, avšak po několika interních ročnících si Red Haťáci uvědomili, že všechny tyto diskuse mohou být otevřené veřejnosti a prospěšné pro open source komunitu. DevConf.CZ se tedy stal každoroční bezplatnou komunitní konferenci pro vývojáře, administrátory, inženýry DevOps, testery, autory dokumentace a další přispěvatele do open source technologií. Konference probíhá v angličtině a v roce 2022 bude poprvé v hybridním formátu: tedy fyzicky na univerzitě, ale i v online prostředí.",
