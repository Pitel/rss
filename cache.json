Fortunately, this is set to change in the next update, with developer Christian Whitehead confirming the upcoming console update will unlock the Switch frame rate.\nThis will allow players to choose between 30FPS and a 60FPS option. It will be similar to Bomb Rush Cyberfunk (which could mean this frame rate may not necessarily maintain silky-smooth performance), but it will at least be an option.

Truth be told, it’s a niche that the studio completely owns at this point, and though we’re surprised other major players in the video game industry have yet to dive into it themselves, we can’t imagine anybody tackling the form without sneaking a few cheeky glances at Digital Eclipse’s work.\nFollowing on from Karateka, Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story is the second in the Gold Master Series and takes a deep dive into the career and mind of Jeff Minter (sometimes referred to as ‘Yak’), an English video game designer and programmer who founded Llamasoft. Though well-known within the industry and by veteran players, you could be forgiven for not knowing a great deal about Minter beyond some of his more famous works, including Tempest 2000, Gridrunner, Akka Arrh, and Attack of the Mutant Camels.

          "description": "\"Suyu currently exists in a legal gray area\".\nEarlier this month, the Switch emulator Yuzu was shut down in response to a legal push from Nintendo. It wasn't all that surprising given the Big-N's historic protection of its properties and disapproval of unsanctioned emulation, and equally unsurprising is that a new Switch emulator is already stepping up to take Yuzu's place — one that, reportedly, is doing everything in its power to avoid a similar legal fate (thanks, Ars Technica).\nSuyu (pronounced 'sue-you' *wink, wink* according to the emulator's GitLab page) is built from the Yuzu source code and its aim is to continue the work of \"the world's most popular, open-source Nintendo Switch emulator, Yuzu.\" It is not ready for use just yet, though the development team seems hopeful that it will get off the ground.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It’s a goodbye to a Moomin, so perhaps you’d think it’s not an important goodbye – just a Moomin, after all. But it sets up the main arc of a well-paced and imaginative musical adventure.\nFor the uninitiated – and we’re not exactly experts ourselves here – a Moomin looks like a cross between a snowman and a hippo. They walk upright and talk, and appear to have the ability to cultivate crops and build quite sophisticated houses. The human-like Snufkin has seemingly been accepted into their society and is called upon to assist with their various problems. These problems range from a dry garden to a lost manuscript and everything in between. “What could lie in between a dry garden and a lost manuscript?”, you might ask. Answer: a giant crab to whom Snufkin must play a flute at level 4 inspiration. But more on all that later…\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Who is Jeff Minter? Unless you’re a long-term fan of his work, you might have asked that upon hearing about Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story, the latest interactive documentary from Digital Eclipse (following on from The Making Of Karateka and Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration). You might have heard Minter’s name in connection with the remake of the unreleased Atari arcade game Akka Arrh in 2023. Maybe you played his mind-warping shooter Polybius in VR. You might remember as far back as the Atari Jaguar and Minter’s phenomenal Tempest 2000, the unexpected highlight of the console’s library. Or perhaps you recall his work from the 8-bit glory days. You could just know him from the daily videos of him feeding his sheep on YouTube.\r\n\n\r\nThe point is that Jeff Minter has been making games for a phenomenally long time – more than 40 years, in fact. And in all that time, he has stayed true to what he believes in. “One of the things we say in the game itself is the idea of him being the last indie developer,” says Chris Kohler, editorial director at Digital Eclipse in California. “The last of the people from the early 80s who very consciously never sold out, never took the money, never looked to expand or do anything other than [be] just Jeff at his computer, making the sorts of video games that he wants to make.”\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's just designed in an \"agnostic\", systems-first way and this in itself makes stealth a possibility. It's also a quiet attempt to capture something of the intricacy of a full-blown military simulator, while still being a very \"arcadey\" game at heart, which owes a little to Arrowhead's own collective time in the military.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The return will come almost a year after they closed its open beta, which ran for a striking 11 months. The platform fighting game sees Batman, Bugs Bunny, Arya Stark, Steven Universe, and other characters from across different WB shows and movies coming together for a Smash Bros.-style square go.\nRead more",

I don't know how White Wolf's RPG is viewed in the land of table tops these days, but here in computerville it has delivered exactly one good video game in the last 25 years (and don't come gibbering to me about 2022's Swansong, it wasn't fit to polish Bloodlines' fangs). Sure, Bloodlines 2 might prove a winner, but given years of delays and a developer change, I'll believe it when I see it.\nWhich brings us to Vampire: The Masquerade - Justice, the beleaguered series' first prowl through the rain-slick streets of VR. In theory, this should be exactly my cup of haemoglobin; a gothic, linear stealth game where you use your vampire powers to sneak across the rooftops of Venice. In its mechanics and design, Justice aspires to be a cut down version of Dishonored. Unfortunately, it's in the cutting down where most of its problems arise. It's too cramped, too basic, and too fuzzy around the edges, and the whole experience ends up being a bit mid.\nRead more",

Is Dune appropriative? Is the appropriation the point? Whatever the case, Funcom want you to know that their upcoming survival game Dune: Awakening has nothing to do with any of that, posting a short Xeet from the official Awakening account that's the written equivalent of sticking your arms straight out, waving your hands, and going \"Woahwoahwoah, hang on a minute.\"\n\"We agree that religion is an integral part of the Dune universe. This is why in Dune: Awakening you will meet and interact with people of different religions along your journey. However, as opposed to the story presented in the books, the player is not a messiah and will not play a major role in any of them. Leading people on a holy war is not why you arrive on Arrakis,\" reads the post in full. Personally, I approve of this effort to keep games apolitical. Politics? In my Dune. No thank you.

I don't have anything specific against The Saboteur, but I do think it's very funny that the list goes, like, \"beloved game from the 90s, beloved game from the 90s, 7/10 action game from 2009, beloved game from the 90s\". Also, I can take the opportunity to make fun of Graham and James, the tallest wrongest boys at RPS, who apparently both liked it.\nRead more",

          "description": "Dragon's Dogma series director Hideaki Itsuno has announced that the meat you can cook over campfires in Dragon's Dogma 2 is, in fact, \"real meat\". There's been a certain amount of PlayStation-instigated speculation about whether the meat is CGI-generated, following the last round of Dragon's Dogma 2 previews. Speaking to Japanese site 4Gamer, as translated by Automaton, Itsuno revealed that the game's scenes of sizzling flesh are derived from live action film of steaks being grilled - partly for the sake of authenticity, and partly to save money versus creating computer models of meat products. You can cook several types of meat in Dragon's Dogma, each of which has its own cutscene, and a number of Dragon's Dogmatists are already performatively salivating at the prospect on social media.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Towards the conclusion, one NPC is selected as \"Beloved\" and promptly abducted by a dragon for you to quest forth and rescue. There are a few characters who are positioned more obviously as romanceables, but the brilliance of the system is that you can raise your Affinity with pretty much anybody. If you want to finish the game staring passionately into the eyes of the court jester or that hearty bloke who runs the armour shop, it's within your power.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Zoria: Age Of Shattering speedruns its fantasy RPG origin story in a quick cutscene montage at the start, so we might as well get that out of the way first, too. Low fantasy world, two warring kingdoms, one uses necromancy (this is cast as bad and cheating rather than practical, for some reason) to comprehensively gain the upper hand, and everything is named like a bunch of Scrabble letters were thrown randomly on the table. You play Elion war hero Captain Witherel - gender and class TBD by the player - in a small group making a final stand at the fortress Daeg Marastir, which is being overrun by the nefarious Izirian army. We start in media bellum, as it were.\nThis first stage, where you escape the fortress, gives you a whistle-stop tour of the main systems in the game. You control a squad of four, the combat is turn-based, you can pitch camp at any time to rest and heal up, and there are crafting systems for potions, food and gear. Zoria isn't really remaking the wheel as much as it is taking spokes from a bunch of other fantasy RPGs you like, and the result is the terrier of RPGs. Small, clearly has a lot of different DNA knocking around in there, and punches above its weight, but it's a bit scrappy and sometimes it's knees dislocate and it falls over. This terrier was made by three people, so that is sort of to be expected.\nRead more",

          "description": "Since the summer of 2020, Unknown 9: Awakening has only existed as a 90-second cinematic teaser trailer. In it, a young girl called Haroona is chased through the narrow streets of Calcutta by a rabble of boys armed with sticks. It's not clear why she's attracted their ire, but as one moves to strike her, a shockwave pulses out from her small body, the world turns grey, and time slows down. As she deftly moves out of harm's way, she turns back to look at her stunned onlookers, a confident smirk rising on her face.\nIt was a striking, if utterly ambiguous debut, and with talk of accompanying podcasts, books, comics and a web series also on the way to help build out this new world even further, it felt like developers Reflector Entertainment were really setting out to make a bold and ambitious first impression. But it's now been four years since that trailer. The books, podcasts and comics have all come and gone, seemingly making little impression, and Awakening, the game aiming to pull this big, expanded universe together, has arguably slipped from both time and memory. Perhaps this will change with its newly-dated summer 2024 release window on the horizon, but having seen a small, hands-off slice of an early mission in the game at publisher Bandai Namco's offices a couple of weeks ago, Awakening's certainly got its work cut out for it.\nRead more",

          "description": "Before I sat down to play three hours of Dragon's Dogma 2 at a Capcom event last month, I gave myself two broad objectives. The first was to discover if there's anything genuinely different about this undeniably enchanting but very familiar sequel to one of the happiest, barmiest action-RPGs of the past 20 years. The second was to royally screw myself by fielding a party consisting exclusively of magic-users. \r\n\n\r\nIn Dragon’s Dogma 2 as in Dragon’s Dogma 1, you lead a gang of up to three AI-controlled \"pawn\" characters – one permanent main sidekick who levels up alongside you, plus two auxiliary pawns created by other players, who are either summoned at Rift stones or spawned into the open world as hired help. As in most RPGs, the ideal party setup is a mix of pure melee, ranged and magical DPS or support classes, but given the whimsicality of Dragon’s Dogma’s sorcery, with its levitation spells and lightning whips, I’ve always wanted to try a whole playthrough as a posse of unescorted occultists.\nRead more",

          "description": "As someone who finds games about cars wot go fast only intermittently interesting, I'd expect a game about cars wot go slow to be positively soporific. Speed is, ultimately, the modus operandi of a car. It gets you where you need to go faster than a horse, and doesn't do annoying things like pooing on your patio or dying (also, potentially, on your patio). Surely, then, playing a game about cars moving at the speed of a dead patio horse defeats the point, like playing a first-person shooter where all the guns fire backwards.\r\n\n\nExpeditions: A Mudrunner Game demonstrates this not to be the case. This bouncy, slimy off-roading simulator is the most fun I've had with an imaginary car since 2018's Jalopy. This is partly because it is as much a physics puzzler filled with limitless conundrums as it is a game about driving, but also because, like Jalopy, it envisions the car as something more than a way to boost egos by doing a big circle.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "When we first meet The Thaumaturge's hero Wiktor Szulski, we're told he's a man cursed by the vice of pride. It's a trait that sits at the heart of his personality, and in this particular alt-history telling of Polish turmoil in Warsaw at the turn of the twentieth century, such 'Flaws' can also attract the attention of otherworldly beings called Salutors - vicious creatures of myth and folklore who follow their quarry around like dark and gloomy shadows, amplifying their worst qualities and, in many cases, driving them to emotional, and often violent, extremes. It's these outbursts that Wiktor will be investigating over the course of this curious detective RPG from the makers of Seven: The Days Long Gone and the upcoming The Witcher 1 Remake, as fortunately for him, Wiktor comes from a long line of storied Salutor tamers, his thaumaturgic know-how allowing him to see these monsters made flesh, exorcise them from their human host, and use them for his own gains.\nHe's a man that's ultimately made peace with his own arrogance, then, but considering everything he goes through during The Thaumaturge's 25 hour-odd run-time, I reckon his pride is pretty justified. Not only is he able to brush off multiple stab and gunshot wounds and clubs to the face when he gets in a fight, but he also achieves several feats of thaumaturgy that we're repeatedly told are thought to be nigh on impossible. Indeed, at the start of this game, his connection with his original Salutor Upyr is hanging by a thread, his worst instincts having got the best of him in a recent attempt to tame and capture a second beast from the ether. By the end, however, I had six Salutors at my beck and call, out of a total of eight. Wiktor is very much a force to be reckoned with, and he makes for a highly compelling lead as you navigate the branching storylines in Warsaw's political hotbed.\nRead more",

There's a meteor scheduled to slamdunk the planet in 30 days, and in that time, you and your fellow players must progress from raising log cabins in the woods to building the means to develop technologies that might somehow avert the apocalypse. The trouble is, pioneering said apocalypse-averting technologies might itself bring about disaster in a gameworld that simulates things like habitat death, species extinction, air pollution and catastrophic flooding. \r\n\n\r\nPlayers must thus walk a careful line between resource exploitation and self-inflicted calamity by monitoring their impact on the overall simulation, founding the right kind of government, and passing laws or devising economies (including player-created currencies) that don't flip the ecosystem upside down. The Steam reviews teem with anecdotes about people waking up to find their oil wells underwater, and it sounds like things will only get knottier when Eco releases out of early access around the end of this year.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I haven't tracked down the original source for Mogilevich's latest statement, and in any case, anything you read from a self-described \"professional fraudster\" should probably be treated with caution.

One of the prominent changes with the NVIDIA R550 Linux driver is bringing the GeForce and workstation GPU support up to \"CERTIFIED\" quality when using NVIDIA's open kernel modules that are distributed as part of their driver package. Previously the open-source (out-of-tree) kernel modules were just certified for their data center GPUs while now they are basically acknowledging that they are in good shape too for GeForce and workstation products.

Well, it turns out there's more where that came from, as the developer says they're going to post something similar every day until the new update arrives.\n\n\nOver on Twitter/X, Barone has uploaded another screenshot from the patch notes, this time in reference to a \"fixed bug where it was faster to harvest left-to-right than right-to-left,\" which has apparently been a small glitch in the game this whole time. The post on X ensures us that lines from the changelog will be \"non-spoilery.\"\n\n\n\n\nAs for when update 1.6 will actually be released, it's scheduled to begin rolling out on March 19, so next Tuesday, all being well. Fans in the Stardew Valley have been eagerly awaiting this next iteration of the game, which is said to be bringing even more content.\n\n\nPlease sir, I want some more!\n\n\nReleased in 2016 – we just passed its eighth birthday – Stardew Valley quickly became a global sensation. Many consider it to be one of the greatest indie games of all time, combining SNES-style visuals in a colorful world with relaxing farm-based gameplay mechanics.\n\n\nSo popular is Barone's title that an orchestral tour went global, which featured a live performance of the game's chill soundtrack. That alone was such a hit, that additional dates had to be added.\n\n\nWhat's next for the developer, then? Well, once update 1.6 is out, many will be anticipating further details on the new project Haunted Chocolatier. We know very little about this game, but what we've seen currently does make it look like it may not steer too far from the Stardew aesthetic.\n\nThe post Stardew Valley dev is posting patch note lines every day until 1.6 arrives appeared first on Destructoid.",

In the first DevLog, he described the game as “Papers Please -lite, with no border checkpoint, no desk, no paperwork, on Mars”. More recently, Pope revealed that the gameplay would involve planning each day, including what's on offer for the Martians and which free refreshments will be on offer.\n\n\nImage via Lucas Pope\n\n\nWhat we do know is that the crank on the side of the Playdate will be used to open a shutter window in order to see who is knocking on the other side, while the d-pad will be used to move the field of vision in the first person viewpoint of the game. \nMars After Midnight will be available at some point today, purchased through the Playdate catalog.

          "description": "Nightdive Studios has announced that their 2023 remake of classic FPS System Shock will be released on PlayStation and Xbox consoles on May 21, 2024. That’s just short of a year after the PC release.\n\n\nI reviewed System Shock back during its PC release, and I thought it was fantastic. Nightdive approached the 1994 classic with obvious reverence, as they left much of it intact, including all the rough bits that usually get sanded down by modern design. It was one of my favorite titles released in 2023.\n\n\nHowever, the console versions lagged behind for some reason, which is unfortunate for some gamers who mainly dwell in front of a TV. Anecdotally, whenever I would bring up the remake, I’d often hear, “I wish they’d release the console version.” Now, here it is! Soon!\n\n\n\n\nThey’re also choosing this time to provide the game with a sizeable content update, including a revamped ending and the ability to pick a female hacker. This was a stretch goal from the game’s Kickstarter. Considering you don’t often see the Hacker (unless you get game over a lot), this didn’t bother me. However, I appreciate the option.\n\n\nNo word on System Shock 2: Enhanced Edition, which is supposed to be free for anyone who pre-ordered the System Shock remake. While we’re on the subject, I’m also still waiting for SiN Reloaded, which was placed on the back burner.\n\n\nThe System Shock remake is available on PC right now. It arrives on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S on May 21, 204.\n\nThe post Nightdive’s System Shock remake is finally coming to consoles in May appeared first on Destructoid.",

Offering PC-like performance on the go, it's proved to be a rare instance for the company: a hardware project that's actually successful. Now, just over two years later, we're still seeing the results of this success.\n\n\nAccording to figures from SteamDB, (as noted by Gaming on Linux), the Steam Deck now sports a total of 14,058 (at the time of writing) titles that are compatible with the system.\n\n\nImage via @OnDeck/Twitter.\n\n\nOf those, 9,444 are labeled as \"Playable,\" while 4,614 are down as \"Verified.\" The former means games should play but may be missing certain things or not be as well optimized. The latter means they should run absolutely tip-top and no mistake.\n\n\nSo, SO many games\n\n\nIf you take the filters out of the search, it shows that 165,119 games reside on Steam currently. That's...a lot of games, so the Deck still has some way to go. The database also shows that, of those, 3.958 are \"Unsupported\" when it comes to the device.\n\n\nThis doesn't necessarily mean they won't run per se, but you'll likely encounter issues when playing. In any case, it shows there's still potential for a lot more games to become compatible.\n\n\nBut as the months and years go by, the Steam Deck sees more competition muscling in on its territory. We've already seen ASUS, Lenovo, and MSI offer up their own handheld PC alternatives. At this rate, we could be seeing a saturated market before we know it.\n\nThe post Steam Deck now has over 14,000 compatible games appeared first on Destructoid.",

Yellow Taxi Goes Vroom bills itself as a platformer with no jump button. Instead, you simply put the pedal down and defy gravity as best you can. Beyond simply filling your trunk with assorted junk, you’re also trying to “unravel the grand conspiracy happening on Grandma’s Island”\n\n\nWhile Yellow Taxi Goes Vroom describes itself as N64-inspired, it has a manic quality that you wouldn’t typically find on the console. Or in the rather sluggish early 3D era in general, really. Well, aside from Mad Panic Coaster.\n\n\nI think it looks pretty cool. Not crazy about the name, but the N64 is one of my favorite consoles, even if it does occupy a really uncomfortable time period of video game history. The collectathon platformer blossomed and died really quickly, and it’s been nice to see a small resurgence in the indie and small-budget areas of development. Thankfully, there’s a demo to try out right now, which I will probably do tonight after work.\n\n\nYellow Taxi Goes Vroom is out on April 9th for PC.\n\nThe post N64-inspired collectathon Yellow Taxi Goes Vroom releases next month appeared first on Destructoid.",

In this case, I've found a mod for Doom 2 that scratches that nostalgic itch with its implementation of a classic Mortal Kombat voice line. \n\n\nIn \"Toasty! for Doom,\" ModDB user MilHouse.wad has brought the iconic announcement to id Software's legendary shooter. While playing the game, it's possible to have sound programmer Dan Forden announce his famous \"Toasty!\" line while battling hell demons. Certainly a fitting combination. \n\n\nImage via MilHouse.wad/ModDB.\n\n\nThis is an obvious nod to the original Mortal Kombat game released in 1992, in which Forden's avatar would appear in the corner of the screen at certain points during a bout. It was glorious.\n\n\n\"Excellent!\"\n\n\nAccording to MilHouse.wad, in order to get him to utter his famous \"Toasty!\" line, you'll need to gib an enemy. So basically, just run around with a rocket launcher or the Berserk power up. Will the novelty wear off? Only time will tell.\n\n\nWe're unlikely to see the end of Doom and Doom 2 modding any time soon. And why would we want that? If people stopped tinkering with these FPS classics, we'd never get to see all the beautiful things people can do with the formula, such as make the game run on a toothbrush.\n\n\nThe original games remain an absolute triumph, paving the way for the first-person shooter genre.

The game has been in a great place since its first patch, with players quickly storming any battlefields assaulted by Terminids or Automatons. This patch doesn't impact the game anywhere near as much as the last, but there are still a few noteworthy points — particularly regarding Chargers.  \n\n\nHelldivers 2 Patch 1.000.102 notes, explained\n\n\nImage via Arrowhead Game Studios\n\n\nBelow, we've broken down the Helldivers 2 Patch 1.000.102 in terms that make more sense to us as players.

          "description": "There's something strange going on in the Destiny 2 neighborhood. Bungie announced on Twitter that an in-game Ghostbusters collab heads to Destiny 2 next week. It certainly isn't the first time Guardians have seen worlds collide in-game, and it seems that the practice is steadily picking up pace.\n\n\nDestiny 2 has seen plenty of crossover content in the last couple of years. Collaborations kicked off in earnest during 2022, with crossover cosmetic gear from Fortnite and Assassin's Creed. The following year, partnerships intensified, with a PlayStation crossover bringing in Ghost of Tsushima, God of War, Horizon, and The Last of Us cosmetics. Before the end of 2023, players would also see a crossover with The Witcher. Only a few months into 2024, we already saw Mass Effect cosmetics in Destin…",

          "description": "Once a huge embarrassment for CD Projekt Red, Cyberpunk 2077 has managed to turn the tides to become a pretty big hit in the first-person, sci-fi, dystopian, Keanu Reeves-heavy, RPG genre (so niche). However, as we move forward, the studio is almost ready to say goodbye to the game.\n\n\nIn a recent interview with Game File, Gabe Amatangelo – Cyberpunk 2077's director – revisited the dark days of December 2020, when CDPR's new RPG was finally released. With the launch of last year's Phantom Liberty DLC, the game is thankfully now in much better standing than it was several years ago.\n\n\nTowards the end of the interview, it becomes apparent that the developer is ready to leave 2077 behind for good, saying, \"we're done.\" However, it's possible there will be a few more bits and pieces \"here or there,\" though the team is now fully moving onto new projects.\n\n\n\n\nShoulder-to-shoulder with the greats\n\n\nDespite patch 2.12 releasing recently, Amatangelo's words suggest CD Projekt Red is truly moving on from Cyberpunk 2077. Along with the sequel and a new Witcher saga, the studio is hopefully taking some lessons from what it has learned about that disastrous 2020 launch.\n\n\nAnd learned it it apparently has as well, as Cyberpunk has been nominated in the People's Choice category at this year's BAFTA Games Awards. It joins such high-profile titles as Baldur's Gate 3, Tears of the Kingdom, Marvel's Spider-Man 2, and Lethal Company.\n\n\nIf you want to vote for your favorite out of the options, you can go to the website here. The winner will be announced at the BAFTA ceremony, which is taking place on April 11.\n\nThe post Cyberpunk 2077 is done, but may still get the odd update ‘here or there’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

At the moment, no matter what quality a fruit tree is, cutting it down will result in only wood and the loss of the tree. To get a new tree, players have to pay a visit to Pierre's shop in order to purchase a new sapling. \n\n\nWell, after 1.6, Pierre’s profits are set to drop because cutting down fruit trees will provide players with a sapling, which can be planted to provide the same fruit. Players are understandably overjoyed at the tidbit of information, with commenters celebrating this as a ‘game changer’, especially at end-game when it comes to redesigning the farm. \n\n\nThere is one caveat to this update, as ConcernedApe details within the comments of his post; saplings that have been obtained through chopping down a tree will grow faster, but the fruit will not be of the same quality immediately, increasing in quality as it always has. \n\n\nPatch 1.6 will go live on March 19, the first day of spring, so we’re not likely to see any more small updates like this before then, but we will of course share the patch notes once they’re available, so watch this space.\n\nThe post ConcernedApe shares a random line from upcoming Stardew Valley 1.6 patch notes, getting players excited for fruit trees appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you ask any Final Fantasy fan what their top five favorite songs in the franchise are, there's a 99 percent chance one of them is \"To Zanarkand\" from Final Fantasy X. However, it turns out, it wasn't originally intended for the game. \nThis news comes from Audrey (aitaikimochi on X, formerly Twitter), a mega Final Fantasy fan, Twitch streamer, and CEO of Aitai Japan Inc., who translated a recent interview between Weekly Ochiai and Final Fantasy X composer Nobuo Uematsu, whose credits also include One-Winged Angel and Aerith's Theme from Final Fantasy VII and so much more. In that interview, Uematsu revealed \"To Zanarkand\" originally began as a piece for a French flute player, meant to be played during a recital. \n\n\n\"'To Zanarkand' was actually not meant to be the theme for Final Fantasy X,\" Uematsu tells Weekly Ochiai, as translated by Audrey on X. \"There was a flute player from France who originally asked me to write a song for them to play during a recital. When I wrote the piece, I thought perhaps this sounded a bit too sad for a recital. So I set it aside for the time being. \n\"Sometime after, when I was making the score of Final Fantasy X, I was falling behind all the while the producers were hounding me. So since that flute piece was unused, I just kind of meekly handed it to them. They listened to it and said, 'Yes! This is brilliant!'\" \nIn retrospect, it's wild \"To Zanarkand\" wasn't originally composed by Uematsu for Final Fantasy X because it fits the game's themes so well, nailing the somber and sad tone present throughout Tidus and Yuna's journey in Spira. \nFor more about Final Fantasy music, read Game Informer's exclusive four-part series on composer Masayoshi Soken's score for last year's Final Fantasy XVI:\nPart 1: Creating The Prelude\nPart 2: The Victory Fanfare\nPart 3: Finding A Main Theme\nPart 4: The Sound\nAfter that, read Game Informer's review of Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster. \nWhat's your favorite Final Fantasy theme song?

This news comes from a recent notice to investors that explains board member Juergen Goeldner is taking over as interim CEO in the meantime, as reported by GameDeveloper. \nWhile Starbreeze's messaging around Sjögren's leave isn't super clear – the team simply says it is bidding farewell to the former CEO – today's news arrives after Payday 3 failed to meet expectations, according to GameDeveloper. \n\n\n\"On behalf of the board of directors, I would like to thank Tobias Sjögren for his achievements during the past three years,\" board chairman Torgny Hellström writes in the notice to investors. \"Tobias took over the helm of Starbreeze in a challenging phase of its journey and we wish him well in his future endeavors.\"\nGoeldner, the new interim CEO, adds, \"Starbreeze has a strong history of developing and publishing games globally. After launching Payday 3, the company is well-positioned to leverage the strengths of the organization to monetize and develop the IP portfolio. I am looking forward to assuming an operative position and, together with the management, ensure the execution of this strategy.\"\nGoeldner has 40 years of experience in the games industry, including several executive positions, according to the notice. His last executive position was as CEO of Focus Home Interactive. He has been a member of Starbreeze's board of directors since last year. Starbreeze has initiated a recruitment process for a permanent CEO. \n\n\nPayday 3 hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on September 21.

Set to go live today on PlayStation 5 and PC, Patch 1.000.102 follows a patch from last week that introduced fire tornadoes, meteor showers, weapon buffs, and more to the shooter. \n\"Good day citizens of Super Earth,\" the patch notes read. \"A new patch to aid you in your efforts is coming in.

          "description": "No matter the industry – sports, television, movies, or games – the debate of \"the greatest of all time\" inevitably comes up. These debates are often full of superfluous apples-to-oranges comparisons and, as a result, are unlikely to come up with a definitive answer everyone will be happy with. But that's what makes them so fun. In that spirit, we're taking the month of March to hold our own bracket-style tournament, voted on by readers, to determine the greatest video game of all time.\nThough we here at Game Informer assembled the bracket, even that was heavily influenced by our Reader Vote we held in 2018 to coincide with our 300th issue. Using the results of our 2018 Reader Vote combined with some input from staff, general sentiment in various online communities, and critical reception for more recent games, we assembled a starting bracket of 64 games. From here, we'll hold two rounds of voting per week until we whittle this field down to one ultimate winner.\nWill this result in a definitive selection of the best game ever released? Or will it reveal a coordinated effort from a particular gaming community committed to seeing their favorite game rise through the ranks? Only time will tell. \nWhile this is meant to be a fun experiment to see how the results shake out within the Game Informer readership and community, we hope you'll come back to root for your favorites every Monday and Thursday until we are able to crown our champion in the 2024 Game Gauntlet.

          "description": "MultiVersus, the Warner Bros. free-to-play crossover platform fighter, makes its big comeback on May 28. The game has been rebuilt and returns almost a year after its open beta was taken offline.\nPlayer First Games game director Tony Huynh explains in a developer diary that MultiVersus has been remade from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5, meaning it sports improved visuals and lighting. It also has a totally revamped netcode to provide what Huynh promises will be consistent online performance regardless of platform.\nEvery existing fighter sports new attacks and combat mechanics, and Huynh promises that new fighters are on the way. Additionally, new stages were teased with concept art depicting arenas based on The Powerpuff Girls’ Townsville and Dexter’s Laboratory.\nLastly, Huynh reveals a brand-new PvE mode is coming to the game. He doesn’t go into detail, only teasing it will offer “additional ways of playing with unique rewards.” \n\n\nMultiVersus was first launched in open beta last May and pits characters across Warner Bros. stable of IPs, such as DC, Looney Tunes, and even Game of Thrones, in a tag-team-focused twist of Super Smash Bros. inspired combat. The game was initially quite popular and generally well-liked. Writer Bryan Vore gave the game’s beta incarnation an 8 out of 10 in our review, writing that “Living games have the potential to go in frustrating directions, but MultiVersus has a strong foundation. If it can meaningfully roll out content and smooth out its rough edges, this could become a new crossover obsession for years to come.” \nUnfortunately, months of infrequent updates and lack of communication following the game’s second season saw engagement decline. Player First Games pulled MultiVersus from stores to address these criticisms. When the game returns, it will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.\nAre you looking forward to jumping back into the new and improved MultiVersus?

Movie, Nintendo and Illumination have announced that work has begun on a second movie set in the world of Super Mario Bros. The announcement, made by Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto and Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri, states that this film will arrive in theaters in the United States on April 3, 2026.\nWhile the announcement stops short of calling this \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" or even referring to it as a sequel, Miyamoto confirms that Nintendo and Illumination are working together on this one, and the director duo of the first film, Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, are returning. \"As for the details of the new movie, as I often say, we'll let you know once we're at the stage where we're ready to share more,\" Miyamoto said in the announcement video posted on Nintendo of America's YouTube channel. \"This time, we're thinking about broadening Mario's world further and it'll have a bright and fun story. We hope you'll look forward to it!\"\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie stars Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Day, Jack Black, Keegan-Michael Key, and Seth Rogen. Nintendo and Illumination have yet to confirm any of the cast of this new film set in the Super Mario Bros. world. The Super Mario Bros. Movie arrived in theaters on April 5, 2023 to positive fan and critic reception, and earned a place among the highest-grossing films of all time. The new film set in this same world is set to arrive almost exactly three years later on April 3, 2026.\nWhat do you want to see from a new Super Mario Bros. animated movie? Do you think it'll be another wide cast film? Or will it zero in on a specific subset of characters, like a Luigi's Mansion or Donkey Kong Country movie?",

Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.\nJoin Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

However, a few months after the game's June release during The Game Awards 2023, Square Enix revealed FFXVI would be getting two DLCs. \nThe first – Echoes of the Fallen – was a combat-centric DLC released that same night. The second – The Rising Tide – is a more expansive, story-focused DLC about the Leviathan Eikon curiously missing from the main game. While we still don't know when to expect The Rising Tide other than this spring, I spoke to Yoshida and DLC director Takeo Kujiraoka about what players can expect and more, and you can read about that in my preview here. \n\n\nI also asked the d…",

He was 68.\nThe news was broken early this morning in a public letter by Toriyama's manga studio, Bird Studio. Bird revealed in a letter posted on the official Dragon Ball X account that Toriyama died on March 1 of acute subdural hematoma. A private funeral service was held, and the studio has asked fans to respect the privacy of Toriyama's family. You can read the full letter below.\nInformation ; Dear Friends and Partnershttps://t.co/85dXseckzJ pic.twitter.com/aHlx8CGA2M\nMarch 8, 2024\nAkira Toriyama was born in 1955 and became a manga artist at 23. Primarily known for his works in Weekly Shōnen Jump for works such as Dr. Slump, his biggest claim to fame would be Dragon Ball. First published in 1983, Dragon Ball would explode into a cultural phenomenon, spawning a massively popular multimedia franchise with multiple manga volumes, a successful long-running anime, several films, and a litany of merchandise. Dragon Ball has become one of the most influential mangas of all time and would also become a massive fixture in video games, with dozens of titles across a variety of platforms. \nUpcoming games based on Toryiama’s work include Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero, the next entry in the Budakai Tenkaichi series, and Sand Land, an action RPG launching on April 26 based on his 2000 manga. \nToryiama would also lend his distinct art style to video games such as the Dragon Quest series, Chrono Trigger, and Blue Dragon. Six years ago, Game Informer editors current and former got together to talk about Toriyama's influence on the game industry. You can watch that video here.\nGame Informer extends its condolences to Toriyama’s family and loved ones.",

This new Warbond is packed with \"high-voltage vibes,\" giving players access to new loadout potential with ultra-futuristic armor, guns that spit lightning, stylish capes, emotes, and more. \nWarbond – Cutting Edge goes live next week on March 14 and brings with it a new \"Acquisitions\" battle pass of things to unlock. However, don't fret if you're still working through the first free and premium Warbonds in Helldivers 2 – Warbonds don't expire. \nCheck out the Helldivers 2 Warbond – Cutting Edge trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nWithin this new Warbond, players will find multiple EX Series armor prototypes. The EX-03 Prototype 3 includes a rubber underlayer for insulation with \"wires that operate at a shocking 400,000 volts.\" The EX-16 Prototype 16 has an electric arc that generates a strong magnetic field. The EX-00 Prototype X is the \"end result of several billion Super Credits and 12 years of research into creating 'the Soldier of Tomorrow.'\"\nIn terms of new weapons, expect electricity. The LAS-16 is a laser rifle that fires in short bursts, and it doesn't need reloading either (just watch for overheating). The SG-8P Punisher Plasma is a modified Punisher shotgun that uses plasma rounds, and the ARC-12 Blitzer projects an arc of close-range lightning. Or, you can charge it up to fire powerful bolts good for taking out multiple targets. \nYou can also unlock the new G-23 Stun grenade and the LAS-7 Dagger pistol, too. \n\nElsewhere in this Warbond, Helldivers will find matching player cards for each cape and three new emotes. \nCutting Edge rolls out to Destroyer Acquisition panels on March 14. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Helldivers 2 review, and then read about the latest patch that added meteor showers and fire tornadoes to the war. \nAre you excited for Warbond – Cutting Edge in Helldivers 2?

After a quick but seemingly successful open beta period on the platform, the company has revealed Final Fantasy XIV will fully launch on Xbox Series X/S on March 21. \nThis news was revealed during the Xbox Partner Preview, with a reminder that players can partake in the open beta right now. Square Enix also revealed that the starter edition of the game, which includes the base campaign A Realm Reborn and the Heavensward and Stormblood expansions, will be available through Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. However, you must claim it as a perk between March 21 and April 19. \n\n\nThe timing of the Xbox Series X/S launch for Final Fantasy XIV comes at a great time as the game's next expansion, Dawntrail, is set to launch this summer. Here's a breakdown of everything you need to know about Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail. \nBefore Dawntrail, though, you'll need to play up through the latest expansion, Endwalker, to be fully caught up on the entire story.

First revealed last October, the game stars a man named Jan shipwrecked on a desolate planet with no one to rely on but himself. And by \"himself,\" I mean multiple versions of himself.\nJan is a miner who crashlands on a hostile planet closely orbiting a star, resulting in deadly hot sunrises. His only method of survival is a high-tech mobile base that requires multiple people with various skills to operate. Thankfully, he harnesses a resource called Rapidium that allows him to create several copies of himself, each their own sentient being with independent specialties and personalities reflecting the \"what if\" scenarios of Jan's life. These copies, or Alters, also have their own ambitions and fears, which will lead to conflicts as you try to work together to survive and, hopefully, escape. \n\n\nThe Alters is launching sometime this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

Intel XeSS upscaling is also supported and if your hardware has headroom to spare, you can use NVIDIA DLAA or FSR 3 Native AA to further boost image quality.” \nGhost of Tsushima on PC also features ultra-wide monitor support, including 21:9 and 32:9 resolutions, as well as 48:9 resolutions for triple monitor setups. \nGhost of Tsushima first launched for PlayStation 4 in 2020.

          "description": "In August 2023, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem arrived in theaters, and, much to the delight of both longtime and newer fans, it was a terrific and fun watch. Just over a month after its theatrical debut, Paramount and Nickelodeon announced that publisher Outright Games and developer A Heartful of Games would be releasing a follow-up video game set in the Mutant Mayhem universe. While it hasn't had a name to this point, Game Informer can now exclusively confirm that the title is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed.\nWarning: This article contains spoilers for the 2023 film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem.\n\nThe 3D brawler/platformer picks up after the events of Mutant Mayhem; the Turtles have been accepted by society following their heroics against Superfly and his band of mutants. Unfortunately, their dream of attending high school as average, everyday students is suddenly interrupted by a new wave of mutants invading New York City. Featuring an all-original storyline, Mutants Unleashed aims to have the same brand of humor as the 2023 film.\nPlayers take control of the four hero turtles, each with a unique playstyle, as they fight their way through the sewers and streets of New York. Outright Games touts how immersive both the world above and below ground is, as well as the cast of familiar faces for the brothers to meet and fight. As co-op is a massive piece of the history of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles video games, players can enjoy two-player local co-op in Mutants Unleashed. \nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed is set to arrive near the end of this year for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. For more info on the other big TMNT video game in development, The Last Ronin, head here for our exclusive interview with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles co-creator Kevin Eastman.",

While Eastman and Laird never got around to creating that storyline in the original run of their comics under their company Mirage Studios, the idea stuck with Eastman through the years, and decades later, as part of the franchise's new life with IDW Publishing, he worked with his longtime collaborator Tom Waltz to bring the idea to the pages of a five-issue miniseries that ran from 2020 to 2022.\nThe story is bleak and gritty, establishing a universe where the four beloved brothers have been taken out one by one.

          "description": "For the 17th time, ScummVM has again been accepted for the Google Summer of Code program this summer.\nThe program intends to bring new contributors into open source projects. In the most recent two years this has included both students and non-students as eligible candidates for participation.\nLike last year, participants can apply for working on either short tasks (about 175 hours of work), or large tasks (about 350 hours of work). The coding period typically runs from start of June through August, but there is some flexibility which allows participants to have longer time frames if they are unable to work full time through the summer.\nScummVM is looking for people interested in participating in GSoC with us. A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we are also open to your own ideas as well. Please provide the required information in your application before submitting.\nWe also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server, in the #scummvm-gsoc channel. This allows you to engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, to get advice about how to get involved with the project, as well as writing your application.\nBased on our previous 16 years of experience with GSoC, we have put together a Google Summer of Code miniportal to help you get started.\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\n>",

In this post, you’ll get a peek behind the quite transparent curtain and learn more on how OpenTTD is developed.",

          "description": "If you don’t know me, I’m Owen Rudge, and have been involved in the online Transport Tycoon community for almost 25 years. Exactly 21 years ago, I received an ICQ message (look it up, kids) out of the blue from a guy named Ludvig Strigeus (nicknamed Ludde). “Hello, you probably don’t know me, but I’ve been working on a project to clone TTD for a while.” he said, more or less. He didn’t want to release this to the public yet, and wasn’t entirely sure what he was going to do with it. (He’d been working on it since 30th June 2002, so I guess that is technically the birthday of what would become OpenTTD…) Ludde sent me a copy of what he’d been working on, and it was very exciting indeed. It was a fully functional version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, written in C. Admittedly incomplete at that time, it was still quite remarkable.",
