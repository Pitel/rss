          "description": "Ooh, shiny.\nEncountering and catching a shiny Pokémon is undoubtedly one of the most satisfying moments of any Pokémon game. The feature returns with Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, of course, but it appears that an exploit has been discovered that, upon discovering a shiny Pokémon under specific conditions, will let you catch it over and over again.\nAs spotted by the folks over at VGC, the exploit comes via YouTube channel Austin John Plays, who goes over the very specific conditions that must be met in order to carry out the exploit. In a nutshell, you'll need to be able to hightail it to a nearby open town (by \"open\", this means one that doesn't contain a loading door) after you've caught the shiny. Keep in mind that a closed town or an open Pokémon Centre won't yield the same results.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "When Nick Popovich was a kid, his parents ran the Sprague Road Tavern in North Royalton, Ohio. \"Everything was a dive bar,\" Popovich, now co-founder and CEO of Monomi Park, says of the drinking scene in the Cleveland suburb. \"It was all working-class, like dive-bar kinda thing. Which is basically what this place was.\" His mum and dad wanted to do up the joint, make it into something resembling what today would be called a sports bar. As part of this plan, Popovich's father added a game room to the building, filled with pool tables, shuffleboard (\"As a result I'm hugely into shuffleboard\", Popovich notes) and most importantly of all, a rotating stock of arcade machines.\nBack in the day, explains Popovich, the cabinet was the expensive thing. So his dad would find a cheap cabinet, they'd put in a cheap second-hand board and monitor, and paint the outside to make it look like the official version of the game. To the regulars drinking and shooting pool, it didn't matter that the arcade cabinet looked like a bootleg – that Donkey Kong was just a picture of a monkey that Popovich Senior had stencilled onto the side of the cabinet. What mattered was that the cabinet did what it needed to do, and that the game inside was legit. This line of thinking, of making something only as good as it needs to be, was an essential component in the development of Slime Rancher, Monomi Park's massively successful sci-fi farming simulator. \"The original Slime Rancher cheated. A very small group of people made it, and it looks like many more people than that made it,\" Popovich says.\nRead more",

          "description": "RPS supporters, who are very generous and probably smell fantastic, might recall a post last week in which I gushed about an Electriq eiQ-32M4K144FS that I’d bought secondhand. What this 4K gaming monitor lacks in brand recognition, it makes up for in smooth performance, despite being absolutely dirt cheap – and you can pick one up for yourself, brand new, in the early Black Friday sales.\r\n\n\r\nThis is a UK-only deal, as I can’t find as the eiQ-32M4K144FS on sale at all from a US retailer. But I can’t stress enough what good value this monitor is for £380: that’s 1440p money, usually, but the eiQ-32M4K144FS is a full 3840x2160 display with a generous 32in of screen space. Between the 144Hz refresh rate and AMD FreeSync/Nvidia G-Sync support, it’s also remarkably stacked for gaming features; I’ve seen for myself how well G-Sync, for instance, eliminates screen tearing on the IPS panel. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Gripping the man around the neck, Ezio holds him steady so that a nearby thief - hired at a fixed rate of 150 florins for an indefinite period of rooftop troublemaking - can take a free swing at his exposed abdomen. The sword connects, though not with its intended target. Instead it catches Ezio in the shoulder, knocking the assassin off-balance. He teeters backward across the tiles and over the lip of the building, falling three floors into the packed street below. The farce of it all is worth every one of the twelve hitpoints he loses in the process.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The courses are oversized and fantastical, and because everyone’s balls are in play at the same time, you get all the light-hearted competition of a real putting contest without waiting for the person in front to take their turn. All fine and dandy. Turn ball collision on, however, and it becomes outright pandemonium. \r\n\n \nRead more",

What's remarkable about Valve's team shooter is how little its fundamentals have changed over those twenty years. The AWP and M4A1? Still pretty much how they were when I was first mishandling them in the Half-Life mod. \r\n\nWhich makes yesterday's Counter-Strike: Global Offensive update pretty remarkable. The AWP's magazine size has been cut in half and the M4A1-S now does less damage at long range.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Games mostly don't do it justice at all, either making \"piracy\" shorthand for \"mindless omnicide for no reason\" or slapping a parroty theme onto a generic action game.\nBuccaneers! isn't primarily a piracy game, but they're one of its four factions. It doesn’t try to be more than a naval combat and light action RPG either, let alone the “real” pirate game I dearly want, but I can’t hold that against it either.  If I was being reductive, I'd call it a budget hybrid of Sea Of Thieves and Sid Meier's Pirates By Sid Meier Aged 33 And 3/4. It's probably unfair to set such high expectations, but the core design is compelling and enjoyable enough to merit it.\nRead more",

I'm saying this to emphasise that I loathe singiing the praises of anything even tangentially related to Marvel, without also revealing that I have stashed a steel chair and bag of thumbtacks under the ring as a surprise attack against Kevin Feige.\nSpider-Man is about as Marvel-related as you can get. I said back when the remaster of Insomniac's first Spider-Man game came to PC that the reason to not buy it was that Miles Morales was coming to PC in a few months. A few months has become now. And I must own that Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a good game. It's a big, bold action adventure full of heroics and quips, and it's still the better Spider-Man game. I think a large part of that is because it's shorter.\nRead more",

          "description": "Hot on the heels of their Solium Infernum announcement at the end of September, the studio behind strategy RPG Armello have announced another new game they're working on during tonight's PC Gaming Show Preview stream. It's called Jumplight Odyssey (or \"J-Lo\" for short, as League Of Geeks studio director and co-founder Trent Kusters affectionately referred to it during an early preview presentation I attended last week), and it's a starship roguelite colony sim that has big 70s anime vibes. Specifically, Star Blazers, the English adaptation of Leiji Matsumoto's seminal Space Battleship Yamato, with which Jumplight shares a lot of its core visual DNA. \nIn it, you play as Princess Euphora, who's on a mission to save her people from the space conquering Zutopans, jumping from planet to planet in search of their Forever Star. It's not due to arrive in early access until sometime next year, but I've seen a sneak peek of it running in an early alpha build, and lemme tell ya. FTL, Rimworld and Two Point Hospital likers (bear with me on that last one) are going to want to take note of this.\nRead more",

Now, imagine that, but also someone asks you to pop your phone in a lockbox, you know, for safekeeping. Also, they say something like “You won’t need it where we’re going” and then do a murder wink at an imaginary camera. Something quite similar to this happens to our ill-fated documentary crew early in The Devil In Me. 'Aha!' I thought. Supermassive are being knowingly, playfully tropey again. Great. These games are best when they lean into the cheese like a drunk buffet guest, and I was pumped to watch it stumble around a schlocky murder party and get baked brie all over the elbows of its best tux.\nFor those yet to stick their snout into Supermassive’s truffle-trove of horror offerings, the basic premise of these narrative adventure games can best be summarised: What if shouting at the screen to try and stop idiot characters performing horror film no-nos actually worked? The formula was both invented and, miraculously, perfected in 2015’s Until Dawn. Since then, the studio have released three ‘episodic’ (although narratively independent) Dark Pictures titles, and The Quarry, all of which can best be summarised: Like Until Dawn, but not as good.\nRead more",

We are amidst the busiest few weeks in PC gaming hardware for at least four years, with major product launches all round (from its rival Radeon RX 7900 XT to Intel’s 13th Gen CPUs) and a neverending stream of other components and peripherals that still need appraising. Also, I get the impression that if I don’t do more Black Friday stuff, senior ReedPop figures will show up at my flat and start taking my fingers with chisels.\r\n\n\r\nStill, there will no doubt be potential graphics card upgrade-makers looking at the RTX 4080 to see if it’s more of a palatable purchase than the RTX 4090. That vanguard of Nvidia’s next-gen Ada Lovelace architecture is by far the most powerful GPU I’ve ever tested, and introduced a very cool new feature in DLSS 3, but with prices starting £1679 / $1599 it’s just not a sensible option. And since I did have an RTX 4080 show up at the last minute – Asus’ customised ROG Strix GeForce RTX 4080 OC Edition – I can at least provide some quick benchmarks and initial thoughts as to whether it’s a better deal.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It is cold, so I have a pink blanket that is my work chair blanket, which I have had for at least five years and I cannot remember washing. I store things using a cunning system of my own devising i.e. the cellotape has been behind the left monitor on my desk for months, so by the transitive property that is now Where The Cellotape Goes. If I put the cellotape somewhere more logical, like in a drawer for keeping things like cellotape, then I would forget where the cellotape is. \nThe area in and around my desk is a nonsensical melange of things, a place that would probably deal you +12 psychological damage if you approached without the necessary preparation.

Drinking too much wine and playing the piano badly and getting chased out of a hotel lobby is easy — most of us could do it — but it takes a degree of talent to sound entertainingly rubbish.\nLikewise, Goat Simulator 3 is an expertly janky game about being a silly little goat and running around causing mischief. It’s a dumb, open-world simulator in which bugs have been promoted to features. Your goat is a horrible little kooky guy who mostly interacts with the environment through the medium of headbutts and licking. They’ll occasionally be catapulted into the sky by a spasmodic police car, or have their head irreversibly enlarged by a special machine, or bleat so hard at a beanstalk that it vanishes into thin air, but even during the most chaotic moments things feel entirely under control.

          "description": "Like so many games buried deep within my Steam library, I am unsure when I bought Painkiller: Black Edition or my exact reasons for doing so. I expect it was cheap in some kind of daily sale. Perhaps I was hungover, and hoped a small treat would ease my aching head. I vaguely recall booting it up once, perhaps a decade ago, and getting no further than its main menu. Painkiller was destined to rot in a digital purgatory of my own design forever, an unassuming icon that I would scroll past on my way to reinstall Destiny 2 for the 12th time without giving it a single thought. That is, until Valve finally sent me my Steam Deck.\r\n\n \nRead more",

There’s also a new Big Head Mode for the game’s recently added Silly Queue, and an in-game store that brings all MultiVersus’ skins and characters into one place for the first time. Weirdly, but appropriately, the game now keeps score of baskets on the Space Jam map and tracks how far away you shoot from too, so have some fun netting three-pointers with that.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It’s an odd pairing on paper - a detective thriller about a string of grisly murders set in the quaint countryside of 16th-century Bavaria - but, surprisingly, this coupling is a match made in heaven. \nIts captivating story of conspiracy and murder is as rich and dense as its setting, and it's clearly made by a passionate team who have a deep love for the period. Playing Pentiment feels like riffling through the painterly pages of a medieval manuscript, but instead of finding the written gospel of saints and sinners, there are tales of angry farmers, greedy landowners, church scandals, religious turmoil, and murder. Fundamentally though, it's a historical tale about faith and truth, and the lengths that people are willing to go to preserve them.\nRead more",

Mickey's entire storyline of being a sad wife guy and seeing ghosts around town was a spin I did not expect, and made me like the character a lot more than just a normal Mickey storyline would have.\nVenture into the valley\nDisney Dreamlight Valley launched into an early access version this year, and it seems to have had a warm reception. It's a little bit of Animal Crossing meets famous Disney characters, but the appeal makes a ton of sense. Slowly building up a town full of Disney mainstays and seeing them interact, as well as completing some chill quests for them, is an interesting premise that seems to have worked out.\nWe'll see what kind of energy Buzz and Woody bring to the neighborhood when they arrive in the valley on December 6.\nThe post Disney Dreamlight Valley gets its Toy Story realm in December appeared first on Destructoid.",

The original Let Us Cling Together has hit a number of devices, from the SNES to the PlayStaiton, on to the PSP and finally, with Tactics Ogre: Reborn, our current crop of modern consoles and PC.\nReborn is a remaster of a remake, bringing forward the PSP strategy classic to somewhere it’s more readily playable and fine-tuning it in the process.

          "description": "PC Engine Memories\nJapanese studio Edia has announced that it is currently developing retro compilation Telenet Shooting Collection for Nintendo Switch. The compendium features a small handful of shmups that jetted out of developer Telenet Japan in the early '90s, finding an audience on Sega Mega Drive and PC Engine.\nThe new collection is the spearhead of a project by Edia to archive the works of Telenet Japan, a developer/publisher that produced a huge library of games for the console era's formative years. From arcade adventures to platformers, beat-'em-ups to shmups, Telenet Japan would develop and/or publish titles for a wide variety of platforms including Sega Mega Drive, MSX, PC Engine, Game Boy, and the Sharp X68000.\n\nThe Telenet Shooting Collection will feature four titles in total: Sega Mega Drive releases Granada (1990) and Gaiares (1990), and PC Engine titles Avenger (1990) and Psychic Storm (1992). No details have been released in regards to any new modes or additional content, nor has a western localization been announced. The collection is set to launch in Japan on Nintendo Switch in the latter half of 2023.\nAdditionally, Edia has launched a crowdfunding campaign on Makuake to help fund the development and marketing of the title. With an achievable goal of around three million yen (around $22,000 USD), Edia hopes that the money can be put toward additional features, as well as marketing materials for the title's official release. With the archiving of gaming's earliest eras now more important than ever, this project is increasingly important and could bring some long M.I.A. releases to new audiences.\nIn related news, Cosmic Fantasy Collection will launch in Japan, December 15, on Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Telenet Shooting Collection compiles some forgotten ’90s shmups appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Cha cha real smooth\nAh, the \"Cha Cha Slide.\" A simple, groovy party song that somehow wormed its way into every elementary school gym class in America. There's truly nothing better than a choreographed song that just yells out the moves to you, because even someone with two left feet can make that work. The song is truly a staple of organized events, but thanks to a Call of Duty streamer with a sense of humor, the \"Cha Cha Slide\" has made its way into Warzone 2.0 in the most wholesome, hilarious way.\nI had almost completely forgotten the \"Cha Cha Slide\" even existed until I saw a video of @JhbTeam playing the song over his microphone in the Warzone proximity chat. As any reasonable person would do, a crowd of enemy players formed in front of him to participate in the greatest line dance known to man. It's surprising how well the \"Cha Cha Slide\" translates to Call of Duty, although I am a bit disappointed no one actually slid when the song instructs them to slide.\nhttps://twitter.com/JhbTeam/status/1594785851242090496\nAccording to JhbTeam, it took them a bunch of tries to get enemy players to stop shooting long enough to get in on the joke. I can absolutely say that whether or not someone is willing to do the \"Cha Cha Slide\" in Warzone is a litmus test for whether or not they would be my friend. All of these players passed the vibe check. You can even see that JhbTeam is receiving friend requests from the other players while conducting the group in the classic dance, so here's hoping that this will be the start of some beautiful friendships.\nAs much as I love CoD, I sometimes find that the series, and some of the people who play it, take themselves a bit too seriously sometimes. Seeing something like this is a great reminder that we're all out here to have fun, and getting a win is often less important than getting into the spirit of the game and sharing in a cool moment with others.\nThe post This Warzone player used proximity chat to do the “Cha Cha Slide” appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Give us a Ring\nNintendo Japan has released a new trailer for its upcoming fantasy epic Fire Emblem Engage, which launches on Nintendo Switch in January of the new year. The new trailer focuses on the strategic gameplay of the RPG sequel — specifically the magical mechanic known as \"Emblem Rings\".\nThe Emblem Ring mechanic allows the protagonist to infuse their skills and abilities with the spirit of other Fire Emblem heroes, whose powers are harnessed within literal rings. Once activated, the Emblem Ring expands upon, boosts, or otherwise enhances certain abilities, as the protagonist takes on the skills and combat arts of their chosen Emblem Ring. In a fashion, it is similar to the Persona mechanic in the series of the same name — except instead of Pixie or Nekomata, you have Celica or Byleth.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIWPFmnu4Vk\nAs they grow alongside their chosen Fire Emblem rings, the protagonist will inherit weapons, skills, and spells from this roster of classic characters, while building up overdrive abilities and all-new ultimate attacks, defined by the classic characters you have chosen to grow alongside. Six rings are featured in this trailer (Sigurd, Celica, Corrin, Lyn, Byleth, and, of course, Marth.

EA Sports confirms it's aiming for a summer 2024 revival of its college football series.\nSpeaking to ESPN, EA Sports VP and general manager Daryl Holt said the timing is due to how much of an undertaking this will be.\n\"That's the best date for us to bring the game that we think is going to meet or exceed our player expectations,\" Holt told ESPN. \"And cover the breadth and scale of what we want in the game. We're trying to build a very immersive college football experience.\"\nPart of this involves use real college football players in the game. Before, using players' likeness in a new EA Sports college football seemed like a non-starter. But as Holt describes it, \"the road's open now, but it's still under construction.\"\nThis echoes some comments from July 2021 about the possibility of using real players in the virtual experience.

The almost mythic puzzler will launch in the near future courtesy of, of all people, Hamster's Arcade Archives range.\nDeveloped by Arika, and originally released in Japanese arcades in 1998, Tetris: The Grand Master follows the typical ruleset of Alexey Pajitnov genre-defining classic, but offers up a staggering 999 levels of play and introduces the \"20G\" mechanic beloved by dedicated players. Essentially, this mechanic sees blocks appear directly on top of the wall, offering the player a split-second to effectively move them into place.\nCheck out the wild action in the classic run below, courtesy of YouTuber Sega-16.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEzvyMI4I9I\nTetris: The Grand Master is recognized by the Tetris community's expert players and speedrunners — those who you see performing almost reality-breaking feats of organization at events such as Awesome Games Done Quick, (or alternately, my friend Jonster, whose own Tetris skills leave me utterly flabbergasted. Look how happy he is in this tweet!). While TGM would receive several readily available sequels, this Arcade Archives release will represent the original's first-ever home release outside of Japan, and as such is a major reckoning for Tetris players.\nNo date has been revealed for the title's launch but, as regular readers will be aware, we cover each and every Arcade Archives release right here on Destructoid, and have done so for many, many years.

The lead title will be Viking adventure Assassin's Creed Valhalla, which will arrive on the Steam platform December 6.\n\"We're constantly evaluating how to bring our games to different audiences wherever they are, while providing a consistent player ecosystem through Ubisoft Connect,\" said Ubisoft in a statement to Eurogamer. \"Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Anno 1800, and Roller Champions are among the Ubisoft titles that will be releasing on Steam.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eCw20F0zmA\nUbisoft had been regularly releasing its games on Steam since the platform's advent back in 2003, but chose to separate from the storefront in 2019 to publish its wares through its in-house Uplay service — and then later via Epic Games Store. Ubisoft's return to Steam was heralded by several database leaks spotted by known Ubisoft leaker YoobieRE, before the publisher finally confirmed its storefront comeback yesterday.\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla, originally launched in 2020, is getting set to receive its final DLC update — titled The Last Chapter. As such, this is a smart time for the game to make its Steam debut, allowing new players to pick up the epic adventure alongside all previously released DLC content. The next Assassin's Creed title, Mirage, is currently in development at Ubisoft.\nThe post Assassin’s Creed Valhalla leads the charge as Ubisoft officially returns to Steam appeared first on Destructoid.",

Marvin is available to purchase today on all platforms for 3000 Gold or 700 Gleamium.\nDebuting in the 1948 Bugs Bunny cartoon Haredevil Hare, Marvin the Martian is a diminutive intergalactic warrior with a bad attitude and an amusingly bureaucratic voice. Marvin would appear in several shorts with Bugs, but is perhaps best known for his ongoing, decades-long feud with Daffy Duck's space-age alter-ego, Duck Dodgers.\nAs a foil to both Bugs Bunny and Duck Dodgers, Marvin is recognized by his fast-moving legs and his tendency to get \"verrrrry angry indeed\" when things are not going h…",

This should come as no surprise, given Pokemon is the largest media franchise in the world and has over 25 years of history. Still, if you haven’t followed the series since its first generation, deciphering it can be overwhelming.\nThe mainline Pokemon series is classified by “generations.\" This is because many Pokemon games are virtually identical, save for a handful of differences or a few enhancements. For example, Pokemon Scarlet & Violet are similar enough that only hardcore fans will play both. This can get especially confusing once you include remakes and rereleases of past Pokemon games. There are over ten games that could be considered “Generation 1,” and you only need to play one of them!\nTo date,…",

Sin Kiske is the next fighter to join the Guilty Gear Strive roster as part of its Season 2 pass, arriving on November 24.\nSin, the son of Guilty Gear mainstay Ky Kiske and Dizzy, shows up here as the \"ever-growing wild boy.\" He's still wielding his flag weapon. And yes, he can still pull out a hunk of meat to chow down on, mid-match.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQoNLBJ0xSc\nThe younger Kiske also makes mention of his mom, lending more fuel to the fire that we might see Dizzy alongside Sin Kiske in Guilty Gear Strive. As for gameplay, IGN had a special presentation revealing the new trailer, as well as some gameplay demonstration of Sin Kiske and how he's changed for Strive.\nHe's got a special bar, a stamina bar, rather than his hunger meter. He seems to have some interesting potential in his follow-ups using this gauge, as well as a buff he can pick up from chowing down on some grub mid-fight.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMfsw4BwiNI\nThe fight continues\nAt the end of the Sin trailer, we also get confirmation that two more fighters are due out in 2023 as part of Season 2. It looks like the content roadmap shown off earlier this year is holding up.\nCrossplay is also hopefully getting officially integrated soon, as its held some beta tests already. Considering an Xbox release is set for next spring, that will be of interest to the new platform's players.\nAs for the last remaining fighters? Well, Slayer seems to be a much-requested addition, and Dizzy getting mentioned in the trailer plants some speculation. I've really liked the original characters so far too, though, so I hope there's at least one more newcomer in the pipeline for Strive.\nThe post Sin Kiske enters the Guilty Gear Strive arena in just a few days appeared first on Destructoid.",

As is the case for all Nendoroids, Shantae stands around four inches in height and features dynamically poseable limbs, so you can have our gal cutting a rug in any way you choose.\nIn terms of accessories, Shantae comes complete with a stand and three separate faceplates, offering her a cute smile, a cheeky wink, or as much of an \"angry face\" as she can muster... Somebody gon' get a hair-whuppin'. Shantae also has alternate arms posed for dancing, pointing, and fireball flinging, as well as a replacement ponytail in freeform whip action. As the cherry on the cake, Shantae is accompanied by a teeny figurine, reflecting her Monkey form from the smash hit series. Adorbs.\n\nIf you fancy inviting the Shantae Nendo into your home, then she is available to pre-order from the Good Smile Co. website and other dedicated merch retailers, priced at ¥8,900, (roughly $57), not including shipping or any potential customs charges.

As she battles her way through the underworld, our young maiden will mastery the ancient art of the samurai, defeating ungodly creatures on her journey to return to her own time.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZOnAzJOXvI&t\nDespite the overall cheesiness of the characters and setup, I have to admit that I think Samurai Maiden looks pretty sharp (pun fully intended).

Superliminal's \"kick\" lies in the concept of optical illusions, and tasks the player with escaping a series of chambers utilizing elements of forced perspective, object scaling, and the manipulation of the third dimension in order to craft a path to the exit.\nBetter demonstrated than explained, you can check out the action in the trailer below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KY87ldajFY\nThe new PS5/Xbox Series X port of Superliminal supports 4K resolution with a framerate of 60 frames per second.

As part of Yasuda's presentation, a slide was shown that featured logos and images from action RPG franchise Ninja Gaiden, and 3D scrapper series Dead or Alive, complete with a header of \"Reboots of popular series\". A translation from Ruliweb suggests that Yasuda said news of these projects would arrive \"as soon as possible\".\nThe last mainline Ninja Gaiden release was 2012's Ninja Gaiden 3, …",

          "description": "A notebook and a highlighter set\nAnother first part Nintendo release: another My Nintendo reward. This time Pokemon Scarlet and Violet is getting an expected physical item release, and it actually entails two things.\nHere's all we know at the moment:\n\"Two new rewards - Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet partner pokemon mini-notebook and Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet violet highlighter with case are coming. Stay tuned for more info.\"\n\nThe notebook is adorned with iconography of the new generational starters, and the highlighter set is themed after the two legendaries (and the coloring of Scarlet and Violet itself). It's hard to say what point value these could clock in at when they hit the system, but count on at least 500 Platinum Points per item.\nAlso, it's very important to note that nearly all Pokemon items (even the crossover keychain with Splatoon 3) \"sell out\" of My Nintendo stock shortly after they launch. Make sure you have the points for the one(s) you want!\nAs a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.\nThe post My Nintendo is getting physical Pokemon Scarlet and Violet rewards soon appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Legendary Sonic designer and Balan Wonderworld director Yuji Naka has been arrested in Tokyo in connection to an insider trading investigation involving the reveal of a Dragon Quest game. \nAccording to the Japanese news outlet FNN, the last 24 hours saw ex-Square Enix employee Taisuke Sazaki and his friend Fumiaki Suzuki arrested on suspicion for insider trading. In 2020, developer Aiming had been set to announce its mobile game Dragon Quest Tact, and Sazaki and Suzuki are alleged to have known details about the game before it was publicly revealed. The pair reportedly purchased a combined 162,000 shares of Aiming for roughly 47.2 million yen (or over $335,000) in advance with the intent of profiting on a potentially higher stock price stemming from Tact’s announcement. \nYuji Naka is now suspected of being involved in this scandal as well. He is accused of purchasing 10,000 shares worth 2.8 million yen (roughly $20,000) in Aiming for the same purpose of profiting from Tact’s reveal. Naka was apprehended by Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, and the investigation is ongoing. It’s currently unknown if the suspects still own their shares or if they already sold them.  \nThis is the second major controversy Naka has found himself involved with this year. In April, Naka publicly blasted Square Enix on Twitter over his removal as director from Balan Wonderworld prior to its release, blaming Square for the game’s critical failure. This outburst came after the conclusion of a lawsuit he’d previously filed against the publisher. Naka is best known as the lead programmer behind the original Sonic the Hedgehog games for Sega Genesis and Nights into Dreams. \n[Source: FNN]",

The video revealed some details on the project’s status as well as some early images. \n\n\nThe Splinter Cell remake was first announced last December, but we’ve known very little about it other than it’s being rebuilt from scratch in Snowdrop Engine (used to make The Division, Mario + Rabbids games). In the video, the team states the experience will be identical to the 2002 title but it wants to implement improvements and features introduced in later Splinter Cell titles as well as smooth some rough edges. For example, the team wants to give players more opportunities to de-escalate situations when things go awry instead of getting an instant Game Over. \nThe dev team also shares that the project is still in the early prototyping phase. As such, the studio will be going dark “for a while” to focus on making the game, so it will likely be a good while before we hear anything substantial about the remake again. In the meantime, you can take a look at the gallery of new concept images shared during the presentation below. \n\nSplinter Cell doesn’t have a release window or announced platforms. This remake is only one of many on the horizon, and you can keep up with all of them by checking our big list of upcoming video game remakes.",

And now, due to Saints Row failing to meet the full expectations of Embracer Group, developer Volition will become part of Gearbox Entertainment. \nThis news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reports that Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors discussed this transition in a statement released alongside the company's second-quarter earning results. \n\n\n\"The reception of Saints Row did not meet the full expectations and left the fanbase partially polarized,\" Wingefores said in the statement. \"The game development studio, Volition, has been working hard to improve the player experience. Financially, Saints Row has performed in line with management expectations in the quarter. Going forward, Volition will transition to become part of Gearbox which has all the tools, including an experienced management team in the US, to create future success at Volition.\"\nWingefors notes that this is the first time the company has performed an \"internal group transfer where we transfer a major studio between operative groups,\" but says that \"it is not necessarily the last.\" \nSaints Row currently sits at 61 on Metacritic (for the PlayStation 5 version), with a user score of 2.1. Game Informer gave the game an 8.5 out of 10 in its review and you can read what we liked about Saints Row here. \n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]\nDid you play Saints Row?

This news was revealed through a title card teased at the end of the Fortnite Champion Series, which took place over the weekend, as reported by Eurogamer.

As for what's in store for Chapter 4 or what this finale event might play like, that remains unknown. Fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer, though, because the event begins in just a few weeks. \nIf it's anything like previous Fortnite chapter finales, then expect huge PvE battles across the island, plenty of spectacle, an exciting conclusion, and of course, some downtime as the game prepares to launch the next chapter. \n[Source: Eurogamer]\nAre you tuning into the finale event for Fortnite Chapter 3?

Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the embedded episode below. \nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. \n\n\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, and Blake Hester as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure.

The news also provided insight into the sequel's development status. \nAccording to a press release, Control 2 (once known as Codename Heron) is currently in the concept phase, being built in Remedy’s proprietary Northlight engine. The game will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Remedy will publish the PC version while 505 will handle the game’s console releases. Control 2 has no release window, but Remedy did release a piece of concept art, posted below. \nThe press release also states that Control 2’s development budget initially sat at 50 million euros. Remedy and 505 will equally split marketing and development costs, as well as revenue generated by its release. Remedy retains full ownership of the Control IP, however. The press release also reveals that the first Control has sold over 3 million copies since launching in 2019. \n“We are excited to deepen our cooperation with Remedy and continue the success story of Control together,” say Rami and Raffi Galante, co-CEOs of Digital Bros Group/505 Games. “... Control is the biggest investment 505 Games has ever made, so it has a special place in our hearts. We are grateful to the whole player community that has made Control such a long-lasting and loved game, and are even more excited to bring out Control 2.”\nThis announcement was first teased last June, when Remedy and 505 revealed plans for new triple-A Control experiences. That same update revealed an upcoming multiplayer spin-off title known as Project Condor. Earlier this year, Remedy also struck a deal with Rockstar to develop remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2.",

          "description": "Dragon Age: Absolution is coming to Netflix on December 9. A new trailer provides a deeper look into the adult animated series' premise and new heroes. \nThe story centers on Miriam, an elven mercenary and former slave tasked with stealing a powerful and dangerous artifact. When the heist goes awry, the situation escalates into a larger fight for survival for Miriam and her friends. Set in Tevinter, the show features an original cast of heroes and, potentially, some old favorites (the characters at 0:45 look a lot like Cassandra and Leliana). Check out the trailer below. \n\n\nFirst announced during Netflix Geeked Week in June, Dragon Age: Absolution’s cast includes Kimberly Brooks (Miriam), Matthew Mercer (Fairbanks), Ashly Burch (Qwydion), Phil Lamarr (Roland), and Josh Keaton (Rezaren). The series consists of six 30-minute episodes. \nThough steeped in Dragon Age lore, it remains to be seen if the show has any connection to the upcoming Dragon Age: Dreadwolf. Absolution is far from the only video game adaptation Netflix has in the works. The CG-animated Sonic Prime also premieres in December. The streaming giant also announced a live-action Gears of War movie and its own animated series.",

Awaceb’s founders grew up in a small French territory east of Australia called New Caledonia, and this debut game from the studio is inspired by their childhood there. I visited New Caledonia in September, and joined the team from Awaceb to learn more about the culture, peoples, and geography that make it such a memorable place.  \nCheck out the new issue to discover more about the trip and the game.\nOur video below features a small part of the lovely Tchia soundtrack alongside glimpses of video taken during the trip, as well as gameplay footage of Tchia.  \n\n\nTchia is set to release in early 2023 on PS5, PS4, and PC. \nPurchase",

While we were in the city, Game Informer video editor Alex Van Aken and I thought it would be a great idea to take advantage of our proximity to Universal Studios Japan to visit Super Nintendo World. Like you, we saw the tour provided by the legendary Shigeru Miyamoto, but we needed to see it for ourselves. And to be quite frank, we are so glad that we did.\nIt's impossible to fully convey how cool most of our time at Super Nintendo World was. From the moment we exited the giant warp pipe at the entrance, we felt transported into an actual Mario game.

The process started yesterday, and Google has posted an FAQ breaking down how it works. \nAs previously announced, Google is refunding all software purchases through the Stadia Store (such as games, DLC, in-game currency, and current pre-orders) and hardware purchases made through the Google Store; physical store purchases cannot be refunded. Eligible hardware includes:\nStadia Controller\nFounder's Edition\nPremiere Edition\nPlay and Watch with Google TV packages\nStadia Pro subscriptions will not be refunded, but members can play their Pro titles until the shutdown. However, those who purchased a subscription on or after September 29, 2022, and were charged for it will have that money returned. \nRefunds will be issued to the form of payment used to make the purchase. If that account is no longer available, Google will send an email with instructions for setting up an alternative method of receiving the refund.\nUsers may have already received an email notifying them of their refund status. Although payments are now being issued, that doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll get yours today or this week. This will be a gradual rollout that will continue up until January 18. There's no way of knowing when you'll receive your refund, so eligible users should keep an eye on their inbox and bank account over the coming days or weeks.",
