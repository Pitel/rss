The opening cinematic details a world where a kingdom has been under the thumb of an evil monarch for hundreds of years until a hero finally arrives to stop him.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

While we were all thinking about additions to the current game, however, some eagle-eyed viewers of The Super Mario Bros. Movie on Reddit have spotted what they believe to be a teaser for a whole new entry in the Mario Kart series.\nAs noted by AutomaticSir411 on the r/mariokart Reddit forum, the pipes on the top of the Super Mario Bros. Plumbing van have several codes on them, one of which reads \"221203MK10500N\". To some (AKA, us) this looked like nothing more than a series of numbers and letters, but AutomaticSir411 speculates that the concluding \"MK10500N\" might, in fact, signify that there is a 'Mario Kart 10' coming 'soon'.

Well, Geoff and his freshly pressed Summer Game Fest trainers have only gone and done it for them, and wouldn't you know it, it's a new Prince Of Persia game called The Lost Crown. Sorry, Sands Of Time Remake, you're old news now.\nBut even before Geoff got his pristine reveal mitts on it (probably), I went to see and play this new Prince Of Persia game over at Ubisoft Montpellier - and if the reveal trailer hasn't already convinced you this is something special, take it from me: this is rad as heck, and you can read more of my thoughts about it after its full reveal at Ubisoft Forward next Monday. Until then, though, here's everything else I can share about it right now, so ready yourselves for some cold, hard factoids. Here we go.\nRead more",

But in actuality, I simply don't know, because after ten-plus hours and multiple playthroughs, that all-important question remains unanswered. It’s not something unique to my dashing, tentacled suitor, either. Many of my romantic pursuits in the Neath totally fizzled out. It's giving Berocca when I wanted Coke and Mentos.\nMask Of The Rose is Failbetter’s visual novel dating sim set in the Fallen London universe, an already established alt-history Victorian London that the studio has been building over a decade as a quite excellent browser game. In this alternative history,  London has been dragged through the Earth’s crust by bats and now resides in a vast underground cavern called the Neath. With the economy literally in the pits and Queen Vicky refusing to leave her cushy palace, London has become somewhat unruly, turning into a lasciviously gothic underworld home to a whole parade of monsters, devils, living statues, cloaked beings with red eyes... basically the entire cast of the Goosebumps books.\nRead more",

It's well-rated by reviewers and suitable for mid-range systems, and thanks to this limited time deal it's way cheaper than anything else similar on the market! \nRead more",

ThroughLine Games should give that a go, because here they are announcing a new game in the same world as 2019's platforming adventure Forgotton Anne. It's a parallel universe where forgotten items, known as forgotlings come to life and endeavour to be remembered again. This new game, due out in 2024, is actually called Forgotlings, and you play as one called Fig in a similarly actiony platformy adventure in a 2D \"semi open-world Metroidvania\". Fig is, by the way, an artist's wooden posing doll, and even though he has a head his face is in his torso. I find this greatly distressing and will not stand for it.\nRead more",

Largely because this was my first experience of it with gamepad controls, and using thumbsticks and face buttons to move and toss out spells just feels more... I don't know, direct? Like I’m actually controlling my Necromancer and her boney bodyguards, not just clicking a unit and watching their animations.\nIt helps that Diablo IV’s Steam Deck performance is surprisingly spry, with fast 45-60fps framerates within reach even when leaving the majority of graphics settings on Ultra quality. Unlike all of the other best Steam Deck games, there’s no native support for its Battle.net launcher, but with some resourcefulness, that needs only be a temporary barrier.\nRead more",

          "description": "Some games adapt to VR more naturally than others. Games that take place primarily in a cockpit, like Elite Dangerous or Euro Truck Simulator 2, need relatively little adjustment to make them enjoyable in VR. They don't require the player to move around much, and their whole shtick about providing an authentic, immersive experience. \r\n\n\r\nGames that require a lot of fast movement, or require the player to keep track of a lot of different objects, are generally harder to make work through VR Goggles. Hence why Amid Evil VR caught my attention. Shooters are common VR fodder, but they're typically built as VR experiences from the ground up. Amid Evil, on the other hand, is a flatscreen retro shooter designed to be reactive, surreal, and above all, fast. It's a game where you zip around arcane dimensions like a magic missile, splattering weird little armoured guys with enchanted swords and a staff that fires planets. It's a brilliant game, one of the best old-skool shooters to emerge from the genre's revival. But on paper, it's about as VR friendly as Morpheus.\r\n\n \nRead more",

But it's set very thoroughly in Taiwan towards the end of World War II, and though the focus is a young girl's relationship with her family and friends, that context is critical to why I've enjoyed it so much.\nTaxonomy aside, then, the important thing is that it's enjoyable. It hasn't hit the emotional highs of the kind of interactive fiction I favour, but for a story with such heavy themes, it provides a relaxing drip feed of mystery reveals and plot thickenings in between low-pressure minigames. It's a good time, without undermining its obvious respect for the people who had to live through this.\nRead more",

He’d come to the tech expo with Condor, a studio he’d co-founded only a few months prior, to show off Justice League: Task Force. A humble fighting game in the vein of Street Fighter, it was given a small demo booth and placed next to another game that featured a cast of superheroes, a strikingly similar visual style and, much to Brevik’s surprise, the very same name.\r\n\n\r\nWithout their knowing, Condor were one of two studios hired to develop the DC Comics tie-in: their Sega Mega Drive/Genesis version set to release alongside a SNES title made by another recently formed team, Silicon & Synapse. “We'd never talked to them,” Brevik says. “We'd never interacted with them. We didn't know there was even another version, and then we show up at the booth and they're side by side, and we're like, this is really weird.” They didn't know it yet, but these Justice League sort-of clones were the first paving stones on the road to the Diablo series. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "When RPS awarded Kentucky Route Zero the title of Game Of The Year in 2013, only two episodes out of an eventual five had been released. If this sounds like a bland statement of fact, just think about it for a second. I can't recall any other time an episodic adventure game has received GOTY-level praise before it was even concluded, let alone only 40% done.\nEpisodes three through five arrived sporadically: in spring 2014, summer 2016, and — after what must have been an agonising hiatus — the start of 2020. Having bypassed this wait to play the game for the first time only recently, I feel wistfully as though I'll never share quite the same fond feelings for it as contemporary fans (like our own reviews ranger Rachel, who recently named KRZ one of her all-time favourite indie games). But I'm also quite relieved that I didn't have to exercise that kind of patience. I mean, I'm very good at neglecting to carry on with games for years at a time despite thoroughly enjoying what I've played so far. But I like doing it on my terms, you know?\nI initially attempted to do something a bit clever with this retrospective. I wanted to play the first two episodes that earned KRZ our GOTY nod in 2013, and write up on them as a discrete entity as far as possible. Only then did I plan to carry on the game and add some follow-up impressions, perhaps assessing whether I thought RPS would still award the big chocolate medal to the full game as it finally came to be in 2020. But, after sitting with my feelings about Episodes 1-2 for a couple of weeks, any intelligent observations I might have made were drowned out by an increasingly loud, insistent voice in the back of my head howling: \"I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS.\" Actually, that might be a good impression to just let stand on its own merits.\n Read more",

All proceeds are split between the participating developers, and there’s some very cool stuff included. \r\n\n\r\n“Purchasing the Queer Games Bundle is a direct action that you can take right now to support queer people in a life-changing way,” reads the bundle's description, “and in exchange, you get over 450 amazing, heartfelt, fun, and radical games and artworks.”\r\n\n \nRead more",

Personally I know, sure as eggs is eggs, that I would absolutely go to pieces. I'm not hitting the end credits of The Tartarus Key in real life, but fortunately, it's a nails thriller puzzle game that fuses PS1-style retro graphics with Saw-esque murder traps. Plus, you know, it's only about six hours end to end, which isn't bad for a semi-magical kidnap plot.\nIn this situation I am not me, of course, but Alex Young, and Alex upon escaping a locked study (an easy warm-up puzzle involving postcards) she finds and frees Torres, an ex-cop turned private detective, who sets up a base of operations around the mysterious mansions main fireplace. From there game's rhythm is clearing the different wings of the house by completing increasingly difficult puzzle rooms, each eventually culminating in finding a new person to save from a new death trap - concocting the antidote for poison or following the instructions to get through an electrocuted floor maze.\nIt's an odd group, but if you rescue everyone you start to see the edges of a wider story. There's a nice layering of paranoia, because most of the puzzles have an element of, for want of a better word, magic to them. One of the very first sees you tasked with getting an academic out of a living flesh-blob, and failure results in it and him vanishing into nowhere. You also find an underground lab with notes on scientific experiments, and a holding cell slash testing chamber - but given that next door is a giant meat freezer sokoban, is it not the case that the lab is just another puzzle room set? The low-poly, low-draw distance style of everything really adds to this, and you keep suspecting that some new puzzle or trap or maybe a weird murderer is going to suddenly loom out of the darkness in front of you. It's the kind of head melting I haven't had since playing Old Gods Rising.\n Read more",

It’s so uncomfortable - and don’t even get me started on that monster Morph.\nEver since I first spotted the creepy Twitter gifs of claymation game Elation For The Wonder Box 6000, I’ve felt that same discomfort in the pit of my stomach. It’s not out yet, or even has a confirmed release date, but I just need people to witness this game. Like, just clicking through the screenshots make the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end.

          "description": "One of my absolute favourite elements of Citizen Sleeper is how you essentially play as a nobody. When we first meet the Sleeper they've had their memories completely erased; the last thing they remember is stuffing themselves into a cargo container and shooting off into the depths of space - a last resort in wanting to escape the clutches of a scary corporation. They now find themselves on a dishevelled space station called Erlin's Eye, desperate and alone. They're essentially an empty shell, and one which you can etch your own story onto.\nBut it’s not their lack of personal identity that makes the Sleeper a nobody (after all, you essentially forge an identity for them as you make decisions throughout the game). It’s the realisation that, in this vast universe that developer Gareth Damian Martin has written, you’re no one. A single grain of sand in a vast desert. No one knows who you are, no one cares about you, and you’re stuck on a lawless space station, helpless, scared, and dying.\nRead more",

Do you want to make a sequel?”\r\n\n\r\nIt’s a question you could imagine being posed to Ken Levine, or Warren Spector, or several other notable designers who could reasonably lay claim to the legacy of Looking Glass and Irrational’s legendary immersive sims. Instead, it was asked of Stephen Kick - at the time, a recently unemployed videogame artist holidaying in a Guatemalan hostel. Up until that point, Kick had dedicated his life to creative pursuits. He had no business background, and none of the acumen required to understand contracts or negotiate licensing fees. More to the point, he had no more than $5,000 to his name. Hardly the foundation for a follow-up to two of the most acclaimed PC games of all time.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Nonetheless, Nightdive Studio’s System Shock remake stays resolutely faithful to the Looking Glass original even when giving it a modern 3D makeover, with a retro flourish in its intentionally pixellated textures.\nAs a snappy little After Eight to the main course of Jeremy Peel’s review and OG System Shock oral history (both great, do go read those first), here’s a look at how the 2023 remake’s visuals compare to the trailblazing immsim’s previous iterations. In other words, the 2015 System Shock: Enhanced Edition, also by Nightdive, and the original. Well, System Shock Classic, which is basically the original except it runs on my PC.\nRead more",

          "description": "That's a lot of armor\nAs part of Summer Game Fest, Nexon has shown off a slice of their upcoming smashy medieval-fantasy multi-player game, Warhaven. They have also revealed that it will be free to try out as part of Steam Next Fest.\nThe trailer sure is a lot. A guy gets clobbered and dies. Then he’s revived. Then things get all explodey, and a bunch of dudes get knocked around. Oh, man. It sure looks like a thing.\nhttps://youtu.be/hiJjooA4Vlc\nI had to actually turn to its now-live Steam page to really figure out what I was supposed to be seeing. Warhaven touts 36-player battles and gives emphasis to its tactical side. It looks like a MOBA, and sure enough, in the steam tags, it says MOBA. Its art style reminds me of a less grim Souls game.\nWarhaven will be free-to-play, and you’ll have a chance to try it out as part of Steam Next Fest (coming next week). The full release is planned for Fall.\nThe post Warhaven will be playable as part of Steam Next Fest appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Yep, it still looks great\nLive at Summer Game Fest 2023, Remedy Entertainment game director Sam Lake took the stage to give us the elevator pitch for Alan Wake 2: one of the least necessary pitches of the modern gaming landscape. Alan Wake 2 looks fantastic so far, but at the very least, we got an actual look at gameplay today. On stage, Keighty reminds Lake that the game was teased at The Game Awards in 2021 for a \"2023\" release. Well, it's 2023, and it already has a date: now we know what it actually looks like.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOr5gh2Kkqw\nThis is \"early on\" in the game, Lake confirms (in case you were worried about spoilers!), and Keighley calls it \"raw unedited\" footage. Saga (who has a pistol with a capacity of 12 rounds in the trailer sequence) is the core focus, as they walk up and enter an extremely creepy house, fighting off enemies in the process. There will be a \"50/50 split\" between the two main characters (Alan Wake and Saga Anderson), Lake says, and you can swap between them at \"given points\" in the story.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hm0AmdB9AM\nAlan Wake 2 is still due out on October 17, 2023 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.\nThe post Alan Wake 2 footage debuts at Summer Game Fest appeared first on Destructoid.",

Instead of just asking players to buy Diablo IV, she's asking them to die — in the game.\nShe begins the video by saying \"If there's one thing I love, it's the sight of blood. And in Diablo IV, there are rivers of it\". This alludes to Blizzard's new campaign where Fox herself will be eulogizing the deaths of some players who use the hashtag #DiabloDeaths. The idea might sound cool, but remember that she also states that it might not be a good eulogy. It's Megan and Blizzard who will ultimately decide whether players died as heroes — or total chumps. Only time will tell!\nhttps://twitter.com/Diablo/status/1666166527953977345?s=20\nThe reading of the deaths will take place on June 8\nDiablo IV has been collecting critical and fan appraisal, as well as selling like hotcakes despite its high price point. Diablo IV has proven such a remarkable comeback for Blizzard that I'm unsure if this was a necessary move.

          "description": "The magnetism of a giant lady in a big ol' hat\nTwo years on from its initial release, (yep, two years), Capcom's gothic-horror title Resident Evil Village is still selling copies and scaring players worldwide — This morning, the publisher announced that the latest, (well, chronologically latest), entry in the survival horror series has surpassed eight million sales.\nResident Evil Village sees returning protagonist Ethan Winters journey into a grim European village, searching for answers following a violent attack on his home and family. There, he will encounter creatures and citizens beyond his darkest nightmare, coming face-to-face with a menagerie of monsters and demons, as well as the four lords of the land — namely Karl Heisenberg, Salvatore Moreau, Donna Beneviento & Angie, and the iconic Lady Dimitrescu, whose impact on the title's marketing, and therefore sales, cannot be overstated.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKocYiRHYlI\nFollowing the game's initial release in May 2021, an expansion pack, Winters' Expansion, was released in October of last year, which added new features and an additional campaign, Shadows of Rose. While the switch from \"classic\" Resi to the modern, first-person Resi has not been to everybody's taste, it cannot be denied that the evolution of the series has been incredibly impressive, borne out in both the critical and praise heaped upon the titles, as well as the titles' respective sales figures — A VR edition of Resident Evil Village was also developed to launch alongside the PlayStation VR2 hardware.\nResident Evil Village is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch (via cloud)\nThe post Resident Evil Village hits 8 million sales milestone appeared first on Destructoid.",

Utilizing a distinct visual style reminiscent of early Mac adventure titles, World of Horror tasks players with guide a party of characters through over 10 nightmarish mysteries, inspired by the works of authors H.P. Lovecraft and Junji Ito.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R1kw_VGigY\nSince its arrival on Early Access, World of Horror has been praised by fans for its utterly unnerving atmosphere, simplistic but bizarrely frightening aesthetic, and moody chiptune soundtrack. Like many horror titles of the home computer age, World of Horror feels particularly unholy, with a sense of evil that permeates through the screen with effectiveness not even afford franchises such as Resident Evil.

          "description": "Prep your Evoker\nThe hopes of the Persona fan community continued to rise as ongoing evidence suggests Atlus is prepping a remake of the much-loved 206 release, Persona 3. While there have already been whispers that said remake was in the works, a new domain purchase by the publisher adds fresh fuel to the fire.\nAtlus has recently updated the domain name \"P3RE\", which has led fans to believe that an announcement pertaining to a Persona 3 Remake or Persona 3 Reloaded is imminent. The \"Reloaded\" suffix would reference the controversial \"Evoker\" guns used by the characters in-game to travel to Tartarus, the mysterious, demon0filled world that exists within The Dark Hour.\nGiven the launch of Summer Game Fest today, there are several key presentations that could see Atlus make the grand reveal, including tonight's kick-off show, hosted by Geoff Keighley, and Sunday's Xbox Games Showcase. Of course, it should be iterated that the Persona 3 remake remains nothing more but speculation at this point. But given the overwhelming success of a simple PC port of Persona 4 Golden, it's easy to assess that a returning P3: FES — offered modern visuals and mechanics — would essentially be a license to print money.\nWhether \"P3R\" shows up or otherwise, the Summer Game Fest stream kicks off today at 12:00 PT / 15:00 ET / 20:00 BST.

Capcom's reimagining of one of the best games in the series has sold millions of copies to date. It's pretty much become one of the most successful releases of 2023 so far.\nHowever, if you haven't yet had a chance to give it a go, and you're in the market for a new graphics cards, you may be interested in an offer AMD is doing. The tech giant is currently giving away copies of the Resident Evil 4 remake. The catch, though, is you do have to purchase a Radeon RX GPU. The website gives a full list of the products that are included in the giveaway. Basically, it looks as though most things in the 6000 and 7000 series will net you a copy of the game.\n[caption id=\"attachment_385035\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1200\"] Screenshot by Destructoid.[/caption]\nThe offer is on until July 1, and it doesn't end there, either. AMD says it's also offering up copies of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. Again, there's a slight catch. It's only free if you buy a Ryzen 7000 series CPU. As always with these types of giveaways, there are terms that need to be met. Check the footnotes on the AMD website to see what the full conditions are before you dive on in.\nArguably the most anticipated game of the year, Resident Evil 4 smashed Steam player records within moments of being released. Where Capcom is going to take its iconic survival horror series from here remains to be seen, but you can take part in a survey to let the studio know your thoughts.\nThe post Resident Evil 4 remake is free, but it requires an AMD GPU purchase appeared first on Destructoid.",

Twice Different is bringing us Winnie’s Hole, a game about mutating Winnie-the-Pooh with a horrific disease, to PC.\nYeah, that’s what I said. In Winnie’s Hole, you play as a virus within the silly bear, and your goal is to burrow through his body and capture cells to mutate. You need to “Refine his primitive form, adapt for survival, and do not let his friends contain you.” It’s grotesque.\nhttps://youtu.be/DuD8G9GzOFw\nUgh. My goodness. Winnie’s Hole is the result of Winnie-the-Pooh slipping into the public domain. Predictably, this has led to a lot of people twisting the character in dark ways, such as the slasher flick Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey. It’s like Alice in Wonderland, it’s almost trite at this point.\nAt the same time, it’s effective, which might be why it’s so common. Twice Different could have created their own characters, but by applying the concept to something more beloved and well-known, you get something more disturbing.\nThere’s no way I’m playing Winnie’s Hole. It does some weird stuff to my empathy glands that just makes me uncomfortable. However, I do appreciate the unique concept, and I know multiple people in the Destructoid community who will be way into this.

          "description": "An impressive sight\nA Street Fighter 6 treadmill streamer has impressed fighting game enthusiasts worldwide on social media. Twitter user @thatMarcWithaC uploaded video Monday of the streamer, known as TalesofMrE, playing SF6 online while walking on a treadmill with his fight stick.\nThe British streamer has straps around his shoulders to keep it in place as he walks forward. What makes this even more impressive is that TalesofMrE achieved a Perfect K.O. while playing Zangief in this setup.\n[caption id=\"attachment_384792\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1200\"] Screenshot via TalesofMrE's Twitch channel[/caption]\nPlaying with a Street Fighter 6 treadmill setup\nWith almost 1,000 followers on Twitch, TalesOfMrE took his treadmill setup online in pursuit of the prestigious Diamond rank. He said he \"almost tripped\" during his June 5 stream but the streamer still managed to defeat his opponent, accompanied by an evil laugh. While the wire of his fight stick looks hazardously close, TalesofMrE notes that \"the perspective of the camera makes it look a lot closer to [his] legs than in reality.\"\nhttps://twitter.com/thatMarcWithaC/status/1665807673093242881\nTalesofMrE eventually achieved Diamond rank, one of the highest ranks you can get in Street Fighter 6, sitting just under Master. Getting a decent workout and playing a superb Street Fighter experience sounds like a lot of fun. Still, succeeding in fighting games at that level requires plenty of concentration and precision, making this feat even more impressive.\nWhen not fighting it out online with bizarre control setups, TalesofMrE also works in the FGC as a community manager at Square Enix!\nThe post Street Fighter 6 streamer defeats opponents while on a treadmill appeared first on Destructoid.",

Previous campaigns have seen cans branded by artists Mashmello, Rosalia, and Ava Max — none of whom I'm aware of because I'm way, way too old.\n\n\"This collaboration with Riot Games allows us to continue elevating the Coca-Cola Creations platform with a brand new flavour that reinforces our shared mission to put fans and players at the forefront of everything we do,\" said Oana Vlad, Senior Director of Global Strategy. \"Coca-Cola Ultimate, our seventh Coca-Cola Creation, carries an astonishing design, unlocks the taste of +XP for players on their journey and enhances their gameplay experience.\"\nSo, the big question... What does XP taste like?\n\"We’re never really going to answer that question in a 'straightforward' way,\" added Vlad, \"They’re mystery flavors. The flavor profile is always, we say, 85 to 90% Coke. And then that 10 to 15% twist of something unexpected.\"\nI'm guessing that the \"taste of XP\" is surprisingly similar to the taste of Acesulphame Potassium.\nOver the coming weeks, LoL players should look out for specially themed Coca-Cola missions in-game, that can be completed in order to unlock exclusive \"Ultimate\" emotes.

          "description": "It's like a black hole but portable and with a cooler name\nHello Games has announced the next free continuation of No Man’s Sky, and it’s called Singularity. It should be dropping for all platforms sometime today.\nThis is a pretty small one, I suppose. Compared to the Interceptor update, I mean. You can now play as a robot, which is pretty cool, and this is heavily featured in the trailer. I’d rather play as a fox. Like, a fox-person. Some sort of fox that travels the stars. A star fox, if you will.\nThe main feature of this update is that it continues the story started in the previous Interceptor update. Allegedly, this is part two of four in the narrative.\nhttps://twitter.com/NoMansSky/status/1666429824817065984?s=20\nFurthermore, there’s the usual tweaks and cosmetic updates in Singularity. However, they're nothing that really makes me want to jump back into its universe.\nFor that matter, I picked up No Man’s Sky again after the Interceptor update and bounced off it yet again. I think the biggest reason for this is a bit of a personal one. Its universe just feels too artificial. These planets are just kind of floating there in a way that’s not natural. It’s hard to explain, but it just kind of ruins the fun of exploration for me.\nI do appreciate that it’s getting constant support, even if, at this point, I have to concede that it’s just not for me.\nThat doesn’t mean it’s not for you, and you can find No Man’s Sky on Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.\nThe post Singularity is the next free update for No Man’s Sky appeared first on Destructoid.",

The game lets you play as Alan and newcomer FBI agent Saga, who each sport separate but connected campaigns. Players can switch between the two at any time, with Saga exploring the pacific northwest while Alan tries to escape the Dark Realm. Since players can change characters freely, this opens up a plethora of storytelling differences; you can even play the full game as one character if you choose. \nThe sequel’s shift to pure survival horror is shown off with the game’s heavy Resident Evil vibes as Saga riddles a terrifying killer with bullets while dodging his attacks. The trailer ends with some investigative gameplay, but we don’t get a long look at this part of the experience.\n\n\nAlan Wake 2 launches on October 17 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via The Epic Game Store.",

If it does, the story will follow a former general named Sheriff Rao as he tries to overcome a corrupt king with the help of the demon prince Beelzebub and his friend Thief.

          "description": "Sega and Sonic Team have announced Sonic Superstars, a new 2D adventure starring the company's Blue Blur. Though Sonic is the star, as the name implies, there are plenty of supporting cast members. In this reveal trailer, we also see Tails, Knuckles, and Amy appear as playable characters, each with their own unique abilities.\nFor the first time since Sonic Adventure, original Sonic the Hedgehog designer and artist Naoto Ohshima returns to the franchise. As the original designer of the Sonic the Hedgehog and Dr. Eggman characters, he will bring an all-new character to the franchise through Sonic Superstars. \nSonic Superstars also introduces seven different Emerald Powers. In the trailer, we see Sonic create clones of himself and climb waterfalls, but the press release also teases \"powering up.\" \nTaking place on the North Star Islands, Sonic Superstars purports to deliver never-before-seen environments, hinting that, despite the compilation-style name, we will be speeding through all new levels instead of the usual suspects like Green Hill and Chemical Plant. The press release teases enormous creatures and evil plans from Dr. Eggman, while Fang the Sniper (AKA Nack the Weasel) from Sonic Triple Trouble, Sonic the Fighters, and other games seems to appear as a secondary enemy.\nIn the trailer, we also see what look to be Special Stages that borrow from the rotating Special Stages from Sonic 1, plus a 3D Special Stage. The modernized HD graphics look great in motion, but the proof will be in how it plays, particularly following how disappointed many in the community were by Sonic the Hedgehog 4. If Sonic Team is able to nail the physics, momentum, and overall feel, Sonic Superstars could do for the 2D Sonic series what New Super Mario Bros. did for the 2D Mario series.\nSonic Superstars releases both digitally and physically for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC this fall, and will start at $60.",

You can watch the full reveal trailer below.\n\n\nThe ending of Mortal Kombat 11 allowed NetherRealm to rework the series a little bit, so this newest entry serves as a reboot of sorts. Classic characters have been put into new scenarios and have new relationships. For example, long-time rivals Scorpion and Sub-Zero are brothers now, and Liu Kang is a god of fire. Additionally, Johnny Cage is now being played by Jean-Claude Van Damme, an actor that inspired the creation of the original Mortal Kombat games.\nKameo fighters put an additional spin on the series' canon, with classic versions of characters like Kano, Sonia, and Jax jumping in to fight by your side. The new mechanic acts as an additional way to customize your characters, with a second roster available to choose as a Kameo after selecting your main fighter. While some fighters will likely be exclusive to the Kameo selection, Ed Boon has clarified that there will be some overlap – Sub-Zero can serve as both a Kameo and a normal fighter.\nMortal Kombat 1 will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC on September 19.",

The remake of Prince of Persia: Sands of Time is still in development, but Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is a wholly new title that feels a bit closer to Prince's original 2D roots.\n\n\nThe gameplay showed an impressive mix of flashy combat and high-speed platforming – much faster then the methodical platforming that inspired it. The protagonist, who has historically always just been called the Prince, looks a bit like his Sands of Time iteration, but otherwise appears to be a totally new character names Sargon. Regarding the story a press release for the game reads, \"In this brand-new adventure, players will embody Sargon, a young, gifted warrior, member of an elite group called The Immortals. As they are sent to rescue Prince Ghassan, they will explore Mount Qaf, a once wondrous place, now cursed and hostile. Sargon and his brothers-in-arms will soon discover that time itself will be a treacherous foe and that the world balance must be restored.\" The press release also says the game is inspired by \"the Metroidvania structure\".\nPrince of Persia: The Lost Crown releases January 16 on Switch, PlayStation 5 and 4, Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One, Amazon Luna and PC through the Epic Games Store and the Ubisoft Store.

In 2021, EA Sports announced the return of its college football franchise, but this time, leaving the NCAA name behind. In a somewhat humorous moment during the interview, when I mentioned \"the return of the NCAA Football franchise,\" Mahar is quick to correct me that it's \"College Football.\" \nWe also dove into what it's like to develop an annualized title, along with the decisions that come with that.

From its humble 1987 Final Fantasy I beginnings to this year’s upcoming tentpole release, Final Fantasy XVI, the series has, in some way, shape, or form, remained prominent for decades. Part of its success likely comes from how easy it is to get into any new mainline game, which is to say every new entry stands alone (save for the few direct sequels). Final Fantasy II isn’t a direct sequel to Final Fantasy I, just like Final Fantasy VII isn’t one to Final Fantasy VI. \nTerms, mechanics, and sometimes even names might be familiar – there are mainstays like chocobos, magic, Cids, and more – but each new entry features its own cast of characters, world, story, and lore.

On day one, we learned Rebirth is \"progressing smoothly.\" Day 2 and Day 3 were less exciting, teasing that players will have a \"high degree of freedom, experiencing a myriad of different stories\" and that players \"will witness a chain of narrative events that lie at the very heart of the Final Fantasy VII story.\" \nFor Day 4, the question is: Do I need to play Final Fantasy VII Remake to enjoy Final Fantasy VII Rebirth? And here's Toriyama's answer: \"No – we have made preparations so that players who did not get a chance to play the first game can fully enjoy Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.\" \nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth\n#FF7R pic.twitter.com/vsmJZvDljw\nJune 5, 2023\nIf I had to guess, Rebirth will feature an introductory cutscene or minimovie that summarizes the events of the first game but only time will tell.\nRebirth is slated to release this winter, although an official release date has not yet been revealed. Considering it's Final Fantasy \"7,\" many are speculating that Square Enix's daily QA will end on Day 7, which would be this Thursday, June 8. That's also the same day Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest presentation will air so perhaps we'll be seeing some footage of Rebirth during that, or at least maybe learning when we can play this game.\nFor more, check out Game Informer's June Summer Game Fest 2023 schedule, and then read our Final Fantasy VII Remake review to find out why you probably should play it before Rebirth. Check out our thoughts on Final Fantasy VII Remake's Episode Intermission DLC after that. \nAre you excited for Final Fantasy VII Rebirth? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "Microsoft announced last month that it would be holding an Xbox Games Showcase this month, immediately followed by a Starfield Direct focused exclusively on Bethesda Game Studios' upcoming sci-fi RPG. According to the vice president of Xbox games marketing at Microsoft Aaron Greenberg, during the showcase, none of the company's first-party games will be \"full CG trailers,\" as reported by GamesRadar. \nHe goes on to explain this means every first-party trailer will be \"either in-game footage, in-engine footage, or in-game footage with some cinematic\" and each trailer will be labeled appropriately so it's clear what we're looking at. Greenberg tweeted this in response to someone poking fun at showcase tendencies to rely heavily on CGI trailers. \nNone of our first party games in the show are full CG trailers. Everything is either in-game footage, in-engine footage, or in-game footage with some cinematics. Each of our trailers will be labeled so it is hopefully clear for our fans.\nJune 4, 2023\nThis all started with Greenberg quote-tweeting an Xbox tweet that highlights that the Xbox Games Showcase is live in seven days (well, six days now) on June 11. He quote-tweeted this Xbox tweet to reveal that the showcase is \"roughly two hours of non stop games, games, games, games, and Starfield.\" \n[Source: GamesRadar]\nWhich game do you hope to see appear during the Xbox Games Showcase?

          "description": "Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the second chapter of the planned Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy of games, received a brief but welcomed progress report from producer Yoshinori Kitase. Though we haven’t heard a peep about the game since its reveal last June, we could be getting a release date soon. \nIn a tweet, Kitase answered the question of how Rebirth is progressing by simply stating, “Development is progressing smoothly and according to plan. We are currently working on nailing down a release date for the game.” \nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth\npic.twitter.com/O4KdGlh4gy\nJune 2, 2023\nWhile not much, the update is an exciting one if things are going as well as Kitase claims. As for when we could hear about a launch date, Summer Game Fest is around the corner, and Square Enix is one of the confirmed partners for the event, so there's a small chance Rebirth will make an appearance. \nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth is currently slated to release this winter for PlayStation 5 and picks up after the events of Final Fantasy VII Remake and its Intermission story expansion. Though it follows Cloud and Co.’s journey beyond Midgar, the cinematic reveal trailer makes it tough to know what to expect given Remake's events (other than Cloud and Sephiroth taking a lot of strolls together), so hopefully, we'll be getting another glimpse of the project sooner than later. \nFor more, be sure to read our reviews of Final Fantasy VII Remake and the Intermission expansion in the Intergrade version. Square Enix is also gearing up to launch Final Fantasy XVI on June 22, which graces Game Informer's cover this month.

The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it?

Nintendo's description of the game says players can split into teams \"and see which group can win a certain number of games first,\" while also noting that many of the games have several variations that change the rules or add extra challenge. \nEverybody 1-2-Switch hits Switch on June 30. Both the physical and digital edition will cost $29.99. \nWhile this is a surprise official announcement from Nintendo, this isn't the first time we've heard of Everybody 1-2-Switch. Former Game Informer and Fanbyte editor Imran Khan wrote a report while at Fanbyte about this sequel. In that report, Khan spoke to several sources who said the game was complete but unannounced because of how badly it was testing. Nintendo didn't know what to do with the game, with many fearing releasing it in its current state could harm the company's reputation for releasing great games. \nIt's unclear what's changed between that report and now – perhaps nothing has changed and Nintendo is using the excitement around The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom to quietly release Everybody 1-2-Switch. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don't have to wait long because Everybody 1-2-Switch hits Switch on June 30. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's review of 1-2-Switch. \nAre you picking up Everybody 1-2-Switch?

          "description": "With the airing of The Meta Quest Gaming Showcase, you could argue that we are officially in the season formerly known as E3. This morning, ahead of its stream, Meta shared details about its upcoming Meta Quest 3 headset, which included a few teases for games that would be revealed during its stream, which you can find the details for below.\nThe showcase ended with the reveal of Asgard's Wrath 2. The original Asgard's Wrath is one of VR's biggest, most ambitious (and well-reviewed) games. The sequel picks up where the story of the first game left off while adding all kinds of new mechanics. You can find more on Asgard's Wrath 2 in the upcoming issue of Game Informer's magazine, where we spoke with the game's director. The other exciting element of the sequel is it will be coming to Quest 2…",

This tattoo connects more widely to the world of FFXVI, Valisthea, and magic’s place in it. \nDuring my cover story trip to Tokyo, Japan, to speak to developer Creative Business Unit III, I learned a lot about magic in FFXVI and how it affects Clive’s life and everyone in this world. The special tattoo on Clive’s face is the mark of a Bearer, which indicates he can use magic. This might seem like a great ability, but the nations of Valisthea view Bearers as something other than human. These nations brand their Bearers to show they are enslaved, and nations trade Bearers across borders based on who needs their magical abilities. When Clive receives this branding, h…",

Xbox head Phil Spencer said on Kinda Funny Games' Xcast that he was disappointed with the Redfall launch. \"I'm upset with myself,\" he told the Xcast.\nDespite hopes for a new approach to the game following that 2020 acquisition, Microsoft remained hands-off and allowed development on the title to continue as normal, save for canceling a PlayStation 5 version of Redfall. \nBloomberg reports that Arkane began development on Redfall i…",

Prosecutors also demanded that Naka pay a fine of 2.5 million yen (roughly $17,900) as well as a supplementary penalty of 170 million yen (roughly $1.2 million). Naka's defense asked that this fine and prison sentence be reduced, but a final decision on the matter isn't expected until July 7, VGC reports. \nNaka, who also directed Balan Wonderworld, was arrested in November in connection to an insider trading investigation involving the reveal of a new Dragon Quest game. Naka was accused of purchasing 10,000 shares worth 2.8 million yen (roughly $20,000) in Aiming, the company behind the new mobile Dragon Quest game. \nThen, less than a month later, Naka was re-arrested on a second charge of insider trading, this time involving the now-defunct mobile battle royale, Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier. Naka reportedly purchased 120,000 shares in Ateam, the developer behind the game, for approximately 144.7 million yen (more than $1 million). \nNow, Naka has been charged and could face more than two and a half years in prison alongside more than $1 million in fines. A final decision on his charges is expected next month. \n[Source: Abema Times via VGC]",

The presumption might be that developer Creative Business Unit III wanted this game to have more violence to accompany its new action-heavy combat, but that’s not the case. The team put little thought into the rating – it just came naturally, according to various members of CBUIII I spoke to for our FFXVI cover story. \n“We actually get this question kind of a lot – people ask us if the rating went up because [we] wanted to make a more violent game, and the answer to that is no,” producer Naoki Yoshida says. “On the outside, it doesn’t appear [the rating system] has changed.

What starts as a revenge story will grow into one of war, its effects on people, and ultimately, Valisthea’s place in a fight between Eikons, Dominants, and more over crystals. \nIt also means we’ll be seeing a lot of Clive’s life. During my cover story trip, I played a few of FFXVI’s opening hours, much of which took place in the past, when Clive is just 15 and his younger brother Joshua even younger.

          "description": "For a licensed racing game, 2021’s Hot Wheels Unleashed was a fun and respectable debut, and now we’ll get to see how developer Milestone builds on that foundation with an upcoming sequel. \nHot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged arrives on October 19 and retains the fun “little toy car in a big world” presentation with new additions under the hood. Players can now get behind the wheel of motorcycles and ATVs, and the game has over 130 vehicles total at launch.\nPlayers race across five diverse environments using new skills: double jumping and lateral dashing. The double jump can be performed at any time to leap over rivals and obstacles, while dashing is great for sideswiping nearby opponents or dodging hazards. Milestone touts increased interactivity between vehicles and objects on and off the track, and playstyles can be customized using perks earned by earning skill points. \n\n\nModes include a revamped story-driven campaign starring four original characters, complete with animated cutscenes. Other challenges include events designed to test players’ skills such as drifting and evading crashes. For online multiplayer, the game supports cross-play (except on Switch), and players can now create friend parties. Local two-player splitscreen also makes a return. \nThe popular creation suite from the first game now features a refined Track Editor with expanded features and a Livery Editor update introducing the Sticker Editor to create and save custom patterns and shapes. Best of all, all user-generated content will be sharable cross-platform at launch, though it's unclear if any player-made content from the original can be imported into this game. \nHot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. Check out some of the sequel's cars in the screenshot gallery below.",

It seems one might be on the way. \nAccording to a new report on Sudbury.com, a news organization that covers the Greater Sudbury area in Canada, which is where Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City was filmed, Sudbury is receiving an $11 million injection from the provincial government, as reported by PCGamesN. This government is funding 20 local projects through the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund Corporation and while a sequel to Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City hasn't officially been named as one of those 20 projects, there is one called \"Umbrella Chronicles,\" and it's receiving $2 million. \nIf you're familiar with the Resident Evil series, you know \"Umbrella Chronicles\" is likely a nod to The Umbrella Chronicles spinoff game. Add in that the film company behind \"Umbrella Chronicles\" is Raccoon HG Film Productions, the same company behind Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City, and the picture gets a little clearer: we might be getting a sequel. \nIt's important to note this isn't an official confirmation of a sequel. Perhaps Raccoon HG Film Productions is making a different Resident Evil movie unattached to Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City. Only time will tell. \nIn the meantime, watch our interview with two of the 2021 film's stars and then check out this featurette from Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City with some behind-the-scenes details. \n[Source: Sudbury.com via PCGamesN]\nDo you want a sequel to Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City?

But all is not what it seems in the world of Varn...\nThe ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for the PC version of the first game of the Might and Magic series: Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Two modes are supported:\nThe original look and feel of the game (sound, which in the original consisted of merely the occasional beep, is not supported)\nA ScummVM-exclusive enhanced mode, which uses the interface of the later Xeen games, including niceties such as better character screens, automapping, and sound effects. It also integrates the impressive \"Might and Magic 1 Graphics Overhaul Mod\", which provides better in-game map and monster graphics. The xeen.cc file is required from Might and Magic: IV or Might and Magic: World of Xeen.\nBoth modes allow saving your game anywhere outside of combat via the ScummVM Global Main Menu (unlike the original game that only saved a single roster when checking into an inn). So make sure you save regularly, just in case you encounter problems.\nHelp us test both game modes by grabbing a daily build and adding mm.dat to the same folder as your game files. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way.\nNow, go forth, and discover the true secrets of the game that started the long running epic fantasy series!\n>",
