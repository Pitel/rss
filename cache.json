          "description": "Nikhil Murthy's Syphilisation is a \"postcolonial 4X game\", which might sound like a contradiction in terms. While approaches to 4X and grand strategy vary hugely between games, factions and players, the genre as a whole is firmly wedded to imperial conquest, both structurally and at the level of narrative aspects and set-dressing. Many 4X games are triumphal re-enactments of specific periods of colonial settlement and expansion. All of which is to say that Syphilisation is fascinating. It's a reworking of the genre which dismantles and reconstructs concepts such as diplomacy, research and production. It's also just left early access - find more details and a playthrough video below.\n Read more",

While it wasn't outstanding in the grander landscape of gaming, enough Warhammer 40K fans seem to have cherished the escapades of bulky blue boltgunner Demetrian Titus for the action game to merit a sequel a decade later. It left its story on something of a cliffhanger, with said hero being dragged away to face untold tortures by the Inquisition, the most zealous sect of this preternaturally paranoid sci-fi universe. Today, Titus is free again. Free to stomp towards hordes of alien foes, blast them with a plasma incinerator, and shred the stragglers with a chainsaw sword. Space Marine 2 is an often-satisfying scrapper that has me  convinced of 40K's merit as a crafting ground for excellent-looking environments and creatures, even if I'm not particularly moved by the bland character of Titus and his fellow Ultramarines.\nRead more",

The DLC is reportedly so bug-ridden that it’s taken many of the base game’s core systems down with it.\nGearbox - who acquired Risk Of Rain from Hopoo Games in 2022 - have since put out a blog with a list of known issues they’re targeting, and encourage players to keep submitting bug reports.

          "description": "In the first post for my series on \"saving\" open world design, I complained that many of today's open worlds feel like checklists of formulaic tasks and rewards, their geography a vaporous staging ground for itemisable, cycling content-gathering opportunities, which flies in the face of the sense of freedom and wonder they're supposed to inspire. My interviewees, Elder Scrolls veterans Matt Firor and Nate Purkeypile, argued that this reflects the expense and scale of today's open world productions, which constrains experimental design both at a practical level and in terms of overall direction.\nCD Projekt open world designer Jakub Tomczak doesn't, as far as I know, have an answer to the issue of production bloat, but he does have a disarmingly obvious solution to the 'checklist problem', based on his time creating missions for Cyberpunk 2077 and its Phantom Liberty expansion: get better at hiding the checklist. Weave it into the landscape and setting more artfully, with an elegant balance of randomisation and responsiveness to the player's behaviour which keeps everything fresh. \r\n\n \nRead more",

If you missed its announcement in May, The Forever Winter is a co-op extraction shooter set in a grim future where you struggle to survive amid an unending hyperindustrial war. Since that reveal developers Fun Dog Studios have mostly been sending out small \"burst transmissions\" - essentially footage from the hellfront - like this patriotic beheading and some panicked gunfights. But today they've made a longer video revealing an early access release date. And - oh! - it's quite soon.\nRead more",

          "description": "I won an awful board game from Nickelodeon once. I say “won”. Actually, I got disconnected phoning into a competition line after I’d gotten through, got upset loudly, my mum called them to complain, they fast tracked me to the next competition thing, I got the quiz answer wrong, and the presenter pretended he’d heard the right answer and pulled a prize out of the big prize bucket. It was a copy of The Game of Life, possibly the least exciting board game a child can win.\nThe game was dog water, and there’s probably a lesson in there somewhere about how cool and good it is to whine until you get free things, but we don’t have time for that. Instead, I’d like to draw your attention to Floops Big House Adventure. It’s a grungy, slimy, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters meets Ren and Stimpy Saturday morning shooter. Some of you will already hate it from the header screenshot, I imagine. Personally, the art drew me right in.\nRead more",

The game was a bright spot in a bad time, which might seem peculiar given that Sluggish Morss often looks like a whale's upset stomach, but it's such a feverishly inventive creation. It blew the dust from my synapses.\nThe same appears true of King-Spooner's upcoming Judero, on which he is collaborating with Soul Searching developer Talha Kaya. It casts you as a \"pagan seer\" armed with a big stick, who is searching the mythical Scottish borderlands for evil creatures to clobber. It looks cheerier and airier than Sluggish Morss, with a more overt emphasis on mechanics such as combat, but it has the same pickled 3am energy to it. It's also now got a release date - 16th September - and a new trailer below.\r\n \nRead more",

It also contains the words “bloody” and “arse” in quick succession, though thankfully not next to each other. The only piles are the logs Sid’s crouched behind as he prepares to sneak up to a cable car guarded by Nazis. That is the only haemorrhoids allusion I will ever make on this website. Until the next time I have to write about Andrew Wilson.\n“Oil just use my trusty knoife” mutters Sid as I take down my first guard. Straight away, the animation and noise indicators evoke the same Shadow Tactics or Desperados III goodness you’re probably expecting. Fine with me - that’s exactly what I’m here for. Mimimi’s closing was a real gutpunch, and while I don’t expect anyone to match their exceptional work any time soon, it’s at least reassuring to see Warsaw studio Artificer picking up the torch.\nRead more",

The false and even defamatory accusations made by\r\nthe STJV in no way reflect the reality of the day-to-day working life of the company's\r\nemployees and are an attack on the reputation of the studio, whose teams are fully\r\nmobilized to produce quality games and enthusiastically ensure the Early Access\r\nrelease of GreedFall 2.\r\n\nSpiders' management is committed to open and constructive social dialogue. After\r\nunsuccessful attempts over the last few days to meet with a delegation of employees,\r\nthey have proposed a meeting again by the end of the week.\r\n\nSpiders' employees are the heart of the studio, and we are determined to maintain an\r\ninclusive and stimulating working environment in which every talent can flourish and of\r\nwhich we can all be proud.\n\nThe email was signed by Consulting Director Caroline Richard and Associate Director Laurence Tovi.\nOriginal article continues below:\nRead more",

While it would be a monumentally silly heel turn to go back on their promise of only charging Space Marine 2 players extra for cosmetics a mere week and change before the shooter’s September 9 release date,  the new year one roadmap does at least look piously forthright.\nChatting to James at Gamescom recently (possibly from his cathedral ship made out of graphics cards), Saber boss Tim Willits dragged out an armoured horse and proceeded to flog it mercilessly, saying that players don’t want to be sold the equivalent of Oblivion's infamous deadbeat daddy of DLCs. As several of you identified, this seemed like an odd comparison when Spice Maureen 2 specifically plans to charge for comparable cosmetics, although I imagine Willits was referencing the “packs” that his space game’s baubles come in. “Our fans never thought we ripped them off in World War Z,” he said, comparing Space Marine 2’s optional spendables to that game.\nWhether you see the cosmetic's pricing as egregious or not, yesterday’s roadmap does look to make good on Saber’s promise to keep wearables and playables separate.

          "description": "Almost a decade after his acrimonious departure from Konami, the shadow of Hideo Kojima still looms over Metal Gear Solid. He's there, barely camouflaged, in the undergrowth of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - a remake of the fifth Metal Gear game, originally released in 2004, which tells the tale of a lone US special operator hunting superweapons and old mentors in the jungles of the southern Soviet Union. \r\n\n\r\nI say \"remake\" but this feels more like a re-release, in spirit. True, it now runs on Unreal Engine, with the option of a manual, third-person perspective and cover-shooter controls in addition to the old top-down viewpoints. Yes, it boasts new flourishes, such as wounds now leaving scars, and clothes picking up stray leaves. Yes, there's a new interface with floating in-world menus, which makes shuffling between the layers a bit less awkward. It's the product of much labour, with development split between Konami and external support partner Virtuos. But where Konami's other big restoration project, Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake, is a creative dialogue with the original game, Delta seems consumed by faithfulness to Kojima's original design.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's also a free-to-play game, and I have the usual unanswered questions about currencies and gacha, but I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt for the minute, because I have not spent nearly enough of my life considering the tactical applications of ballgowns.

(It came out in 1997, and as such, I think the statute of limitations on spoilers has passed, but if you still intend to play, stop reading now.) The mission completes the long arc of foreshadowing begun by the intro's mention that capital-class spacecraft have been outlawed, following a ruinous war. It turns out that one particular evil corpo has been sneakily building one of these megaships - not only that, but you get to fly inside it, cannons ablazing. It was while doing so that teenage me realised the true exceptionality of the Video Game Artform. You can't fly inside capital ships in, like, symbolist poems or baroque symphonies, can you? You can't fly in poems or symphonies at all, unless you do so metaphorically - \"metaphor\" being a kind of poor man's graphics card.\nThe technology of flight simming has advanced mightily since G-Police's day. For instance: in Everspace 2's just-announced Titans DLC, you get to fly inside not just regular old spaceships, but massive space kaiju with procedurally generated digestive systems. Here's the trailer.\nRead more",

You can, quite literally, go on tours curated by historians around each of the game's respective maps. Instead of diving off a Sphinx and plunging your hidden blade into someone's spinal column, you can look up at the Sphinx and read a paragraph on its significance. Maybe view an actual, real life bit of ancient Egypt from an actual real life museum collection in-game. Perhaps embody an Anglo-Saxon lad in Valhalla, instead, and like, cook up some nettle soup having just got a fresh \"Friar Tuck\" at the local hair choppers (no guarantees on this last bit).\nThis is all to say that Black Myth: Wukong deserves such a mode, too. There were so many times throughout my review time where I stopped and stared and wondered as to something's meaning. Not only in the architecture, but in the characters, too. So here I am with a proposition: how about instead of thwacking things with my staff, I can use it as a walking stick and point it at things I want to learn about.\nRead more",

          "description": "I shouldn’t be too surprised really. If a park sim based on Tim Burton’s 1996 B-Movie homage Mars Attacks wasn’t on my bingo card, it’s because I’ve recently binned it and replaced it with a bobble head that simply nods in amused acceptance at whatever videogames decide to do next. And conceptually, Jurassic World Evolution with captive humans instead of dinos isn’t not a potential winner, is it? Still, I was mildly bemused to learn that Mars Attracts, coming sometime next year, is the film’s first licensed game. But then I realised that I’d never thought to check before, which might go some way to explaining the lack of them. Do you reckon they did the pun then worked backwards from there? Respectable, honestly.\nRead more",

Cowboys? Sure. Wizards? Why not. It barely matters, as long as it results in some good puns. As a studio, Thunderful have a reputation for hopping from one style of game to the next, boiling entire genres down to their essence, and reconstituting them with competence and style to exist within a now-familiar steampunk world of colourful pals and Saturday morning cartoon jokes. The studio is a perpetual notion machine. Yes, with SteamWorld Heist 2, they're revisiting the sci-fi bullet-bouncing of their 2016 tactics game SteamWorld Heist, but they're also introducing significant changes to create a compulsive XCOM-like full of sea-faring submariners that may be their best work yet, even against a back catalogue of blinders. \nRead more",

Mind you, I tend to play games with my nose about 10 centimetres from the screen. Forget being flanked - it's the prospect of snipers up ahead I'm worried about.\nIf you're among the people who fret excessively about flankers, I've got great news from Uncle BioWare. Forthcoming RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard will support 21:9 ultrawide monitors. The ultrawide functionality extends to cinematics - you can disable \"cinematic aspect ratios\" to switch off the black bars that otherwise hem in the view.

Still, it does sound like he’s managing to have some fun there, mainly by hitting up Saber Interactive COO and former id Software co-owner Tim Willits for some top tips on how to avenge Edwin’s thieving ways.\nTips about kill-stealing aside, James found time to ask Willits about Space Marine 2's microtransactions, and whether there was any nervousness returning to a cult hit series… especially one a lot of people had almost given up on ever seeing again. “Even the “push forward” combat of the original was part of [id’s] inspiration when we created Doom 2016,” answered Willits. “So for me personally, it’s this huge circle. It’s always intimidating working on a franchise that people love.” But, with the right team, technology, and vision he says, “it just comes together.”\nRead more",

          "description": "Arc Raiders was announced back in 2021 as a free-to-play co-op third-person shooter, and has been delayed several times since. That's partly because Embark Studios' other in-development game, The Finals, progressed faster than planned and stole its momentum. It's also because it was re-tooled at some point as a PvPvE extraction shooter.\r\n\nNow it's back again, aiming for release next year, and it's been re-tooled a little more: it's no longer free-to-play.\r\n\n \nRead more",

You know, something to really convey the flow of the game, rather than the admittedly impressive but nonetheless very fragmented snippets we’ve gotten so far. Now to sit back and…oh, wait. Hang on. It’s just actor Troy Baker telling me about all the great acting he’ll be doing. It is great, by the way. He’s doing a fantastic job. Maybe just, you know, a crumb of acknowledgement or elucidation over the whole ‘interactivity’ part?\nAnyway, don’t mind me. I’m just an old fool who likes to press buttons. And, to be fair, it's not like Machinegames don't have a great track record. Anyway, here’s some good news: The game releases December 9th this year. Have a release date trailer.\nRead more",

          "description": "Little Nightmares DNA runs strong in Tarsier Studios’ new game. So much so, in fact, that I’d assumed the trailer I watched during an online preview event last week was for a new entry in the horror cinematic-platformer series, right up until the name Reanimal appeared on the screen - shortly followed by a snippet of voiced dialogue.\nIt’s not just the horror setting, but the Grimm’s fairytale threat, the distorted adults-made-monsters through the trauma-tinged lens of a child’s imagination. A long-limbed man riding a bicycle in a threadbare suit chases children down an alley. A gangly, bowler-hatted pursuer scuttles down a long table like a spider. It's familiar enough territory, at least at first glance. But when Tarsier have a body of work subconsciously scarred by phantasms this vivid, recurring nightmares are just as potent.\nRead more",

          "description": "Ač to podle počasí nevypadá, prázdniny skončily. Nesmutněte však, neboť již tento čtvrtek bude Virtuální Bastlírna - setkání elektroniků, bastlířů, ajťáků a všech milovníků techniky! Jaké novinky a témata tam čekají? Nový procesor na trhu zpravidla vzruší jen uživatele PC, největší novinka tohoto měsíce se týká spíše bastlířů. Raspberry vydalo nový procesor RP2350, který je výrazným vylepšením původního RP2040. Kromě Arm Cortex M33 jader skrývá také RISC-V jádra a značné množství zajímavých digitálních periferií. Ač oficiální desky ještě nejsou dostupné, samozřejmě se strahovákům procesor i tak dostal do rukou a možná i do hledáčku elektronových mikroskopů. A poví si i proč má nový Bus Pirate s tímto procesorem lehké trable a jaké zajímavosti se nachází v erratě procesoru.\r\n\r\nTím samozřejmě novinky nekončí - ještě se bastlíři zmíní o novém nativním konfiguračním nástroji pro síťové prvky od Mikrotiku a o podpoře jednovrstvých plošných spojů v Altiu. Protože jsou ale bastlíři, nezapomenou i na čistě hardwarová témata.\r\n\r\nZe světa hardwaru ukáží nejen novinky nebo praktické poznatky ohledně minimalistických sad nářadí, které se dají vždy nosit s sebou, ale i pár lehce \"retro\" projektů. Vznikla například replika klávesnice k počítači Ondra a ke starým osciloskopům se dá v současnosti koupit emulátor disketové mechaniky, který používá standardní USB flash disky.\r\n\r\nA jak je zvykem, mají strahováci nachystaná i obskurní až bizarní témata, kupříkladu simulátor 555 na Attiny, čínské klony karet MIFARE Classic s nedokumentovaným backdoorem nebo velice osobité útržky z legendární knihy Rozeberte si PC.\r\n\r\nPříští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve čtvrtek 5. září od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

Here are all the details we know about about Lethal Company Version 64 and the Patch Notes for the update titled The Bag Patch.\n\n\n\n\n\nLethal Company Update 64 Patch Notes\n\n\nCompared to previous updates, Version 64 for Lethal Company is a rather small update. However, as Zeekerss mentioned, it does have some pretty important additions such as a new item, a new rare weather event, and a ton of bug fixes. According to Zeekerss, he's been spending a lot of time working on another project, titled Welcome to the Dark Place, with hopes of finishing it soon.\n\n\nThe last two versions were mostly bug fixes, and so is Version 64, but with at least two new pieces of content, it's a great update for Lethal Company fans to get back into it. Here are the full Lethal Company Version 64 Patch Notes, for the update titled The Bag Patch:\n\n\n\nNew Tactical Belt Bag - The tactical belt bag can now be bought from the terminal. It holds 15 non-scrap items and can be accessed by other players while it's around your waist. Use \"INFO\" to learn more about it.\n\n\nRare Weather Event - A new, rare 0.6% chance weather event can now occur on any day at a random time.\n\n\nBug Fixes - A few bug fixes.\n\n\n\nWhile Zeekerss didn't go into detail about the bug fixes, it's typically changes that overall improve the quality of the game by fixing the rare bug or issue that may occur when playing Lethal Company. The Version 64 update is live now on PC via Steam.\n\nThe post Lethal Company Version 64 Patch Notes – The Bag Patch appeared first on Destructoid.",

They cost a certain amount and earning this currency is not as easy as earning Gold and Moonstones.\n\n\nFortunately, there are a handful of ways to earn Winged Keys, and here's how you can do that.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHow to earn Winged Keys Quidditch Champions\n\n\nThere are two ways of earning Winged Keys:\n\n\n\nComplete Daily and Weekly Challenges\n\n\nReach different milestones in Seasonal events\n\n\n\nCompleting Daily challenges such as playing five PvP matches, winning a game, completing assists, or more can fetch you 2 to 3 Winged Keys. Weekly challenges on the other hand take longer to complete and reward you with 7 to 10 Winged Keys.\n\n\nThe current Season has several milestones and reaching at least level 50 will get you 100 Winged Keys in total. You can continue leveling up; each level beyond 50 will give you 10 of this currency.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHow to use Winged Keys in Quidditch Champions\n\n\nOnce you have enough Winged Keys stacked up, you can head to The Vault under Market to spend them on characters such as Draco Malfoy, Cedric Diggory, Ginny Weasley, and Cho Chang. They are known as the Heroes of Hogwarts and each of their bundles cost 250x Winged Keys.\n\n\nThese characters have their dedicated bundles in the store which also offer other items such as styled wands, house-wise goal celebrations, and colored broom trails.\n\n\nWinged Keys are the enchanted Flying Keys you've read in Harry Potter: Philosopher's Stone. Just like the series, Winged Keys are equally rare to get in Quidditch Champions, and have many uses we've mentioned above.\n\nThe post How to get Winged Keys in Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions appeared first on Destructoid.",

A Sentinel Capital Ship is the last sentinel force sent against the player when they’re fighting sentinels in space. A Sentinel Capital Ship arrives at a level 5 wanted level.

Getting one of the better sets in the game will be important. \n\n\nHere’s what you need to know about the item and how to get it.\n\n\nHow to get the Bull King Iron Horn in Black Myth: Wukong\n\n\nTo get the Bull King Iron Horn in Black Myth: Wukong, you have to beat the boss, Bishui Golden-Eyed Beast, in the secret area of Chapter 5. This area can be accessed in this chapter while doing the Pale-Axe Stalwart’s quest.\n\n\nOnce you can start crafting Mythical level gear, you’ll see that this item will be necessary for crafting the Bull King’s set, which grants you the Unyielding Resolve set bonus.\n\n\nIt should be noted that you can only obtain four units of this resource per story playthrough. If you want to craft the whole set, you need to go into New Game Plus and defeat the Bishui Golden-Eyed Beast again. \n\n\nAt most, you can only craft three of the four pieces of the set in one run. However, there are incentives to run the game again as you’ll unlock additional gear to use in the second playthrough.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nAdditional uses for the Bull King Iron Horn\n\n\nNot only will you be able to get an additional four units of this crafting item, but you’ll also unlock the Dark Iron Staff. This Mythical weapon comes from the Cloud-Patterned Stone Staff upgrade tree and will also require the Bull King Iron Horn. \n\n\nWhile not directly part of the set, its unique effect coincides with the armor’s stats. It’ll “considerably” increase your damage based on how much defense you have. So, with the high defense stat the Bull King set has, this weapon is the perfect match for it. \n\n\nNow with a full set and potentially the staff to go with it, you can take on the next level of New Game Plus and see how strong this setup can get.\n\nThe post How to get the Bull King Iron Horn in Black Myth: Wukong appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Normally, as you're playing Fortnite, you want to avoid taking damage and eliminate others to get a victory royale. However, finishing quests occasionally requires inflicting and taking damage from specific sources. Let's find out where you can find some fire.\n\n\nWhere to find fire in Fortnite\n\n\nThe easiest way to create a fire is by visiting any gas station and blowing up the gas pumps. While you'd typically use gas pumps to refuel your car, letting them explode causes fire on the ground, allowing you to step in it and take damage for your quests.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nYou'll find gas stations all around Fortnite, particularly surrounding major POIs. My go-to is one directly southwest of Doomstadt, but it'll mostly depend on personal preference and the circumstances of your current match.\n\n\nJust be careful while doing this, as the explosion will cause a significant amount of damage to your character. Gather some shields beforehand and keep your health high to make sure you don't eliminate yourself during this process. You can damage gas pumps using guns to maintain a safe distance from the blast or use a pickaxe and quickly run away if you have no other options.\n\n\nA fire will appear on the ground once you cause a gas pump to explode. Stepping in this will damage you, completing any quests related to it. Like before, you'll want to make sure you have high health and shields so the fire doesn't kill you instantly. It doesn't do a ton of damage, but it can still give you a disadvantage against any incoming players.\n\nThe post How to take and survive fire damage in Fortnite Chapter 5, Season 4 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Ahead of the game's fifth anniversary and the release of the Rosetta set, the creators wanted to share the most updated banned and restricted card lists so that everything else can be enjoyed to the fullest. \n\n\nBans and restrictions aren't put in place in Flesh & Blood to bring the game's meta back to what it was. They're used to help keep the game fair and remove damaging combos that might compromise the game's integrity or just not be fun to play with or against. It's important to continuously change the game because the player base can find those making the game can't because they see it through a different lens.

          "description": "Some recent Destiny rumors have been corroborated by reputable industry sources that allege a mobile entry for the franchise, reportedly called Destiny Rising, is currently being worked on by Chinese developer NetEase. While details on the project remain scarce, prominent insiders like Jeff Grubb have commented on its existence and seemingly confirmed that it's still being worked on.\n\n\nThis news comes in the wake of some turmoil at Bungie. At the end of July, the company had its second round of layoffs within a year, with additional employees getting integrated into Sony. Since then, conversations about the studio's mismanagement have coalesced alongside high-ranking departures and scandals.\n\n\nPrevious reporting from Bloomberg and Forbes indicated that a Destiny mobile game may have been among the projects canceled alongside project Payback. However, more recently, The Game Post reported that notable insider Kurakasis posted on X, formerly Twitter, saying, \"Destiny Rising is the title of an unannounced Destiny mobile game being developed by NetEase and Bungie[.] It has not been canceled.\"\n\n\nThe info was seemingly backed up by another insider, Jeff Grubb, who made a comment about the post on Threads. Grubb wrote, \"Yeah, this is real. Not a lot of people from Bungie working on it. It could get announced soon.\" When pressed for further details in the comments, Grubb talked about gameplay, saying, \"It's going to be Destiny on mobile, but with a lot of changes. Hero characters instead of building your own character, for example.\"\n\n\nWhile this new information comes from reputable sources in the industry, it should be taken with a grain of salt. Bungie has not announced Destiny Rising or any Destiny mobile project in any official capacity, and plans can always change.\n\nThe post A NetEase-made Destiny mobile game is allegedly in development appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Thundering Fury is a powerful item in Type Soul (in Roblox) that can imbue your character with electricity and enable some powerful attacks. Its use is pretty simple, but how to get it is less straightforward.\n\n\nWhere to get Thundering Fury in Type Soul\n\n\nTo get Thundering Fury in Type Soul you’re going to need to go to AFK World. I have heard at least one other person say they got it as a Clan Wars review, but the only place I know of from my experience is AFK World.\n\n\nHowever, to get to AFK World you need to get a World Ticket. That is totally something you can get from Clan Wars. World Tickets can also be bought, redeemed from a code, or won in ranked matches. Once you use a World Ticket the AFK World option will unlock on the main menu, and you can enter.\n\n\nAFK World rewards you for… being AFK. Away-from-keyboard, that is. As you wait, every so often (every hour, it seems), it will drop a random item for you. You can increase this by winning PVP battles, which increases your Soulian Streak. The higher your Soulian Streak, the higher the drop rate. However, anyone can attack you once you enter the PVP arena, so if you want to maintain it you need to either hide or protect yourself, which kind of defeats the purpose of AFK World, but I digress.\n\n\nWait around long enough, and you may come into possession of Thundering Fury. It’s a very rare drop, so you may have to leave your game running for quite a long time.\n\n\nHow to use Thundering Fury in Type Soul\n\n\nUsing Thundering Fury in Type Soul is pretty straightforward. You set it to one of your quick key slots, then activate it. Your character will erupt into an aura of lightning, signifying it’s active. The item isn’t used up upon activation.\n\nThe post How to get and use Thundering Fury in Type Soul appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, it's actually used as part of another quest, and ultimately part of the Lost and Found achievement. Here is where to find and turn in the Wooden Figure in WoW The War Within.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHow to get the Wooden Figure\n\n\nYou will receive the Wooden Figure item as a quest reward for completing the Time Borrowed quest from Maera Ashyld in Hallowfall. In fact, she will give you three items: a Calcified Journal, a Wooden Figure, and a Sturdy Locket. All of these items pertain to various local quests that will earn you the Lost and Found achievement.\n\n\nIn order to pick up the Time Borrowed quest, you will need to complete the Memories of the Sky quest chain with Maera Ashyld, which is unfortunately locked behind two weekly reset timegates. This means the first time you can actually pick up and do the Time Borrowed quest is on September 3, 2024, as long as you have been completing all the previous quests each week you can.\n\n\nNext, you need to get 6 Mementos for Maera by farming the mobs around the area. Once you've gotten all 6, turn them into Marea who lets you keep three, including the Wooden Figure.\n\n\nWhere to turn in the Wooden Figure in The War Within\n\n\nNow that you've got your hands on the Wooden Figure, you can use it to get the quest properly titled, well, Wooden Figure. You must then take the Wooden Figure to the NPC Barahl Lynflayme, located in the area called Dunelle's Kindness in Hallowfall.\n\n\nHanding it over to Barahl will complete the quest and earn you progress toward the Lost and Found achievement. If this was the last step of the achievement for you, you will also receive the Sandy Quotidian Wear cosmetic ensemble appearance for completing the achievement.\n\nThe post Where to find and turn in the Wooden Figure in WoW The War Within appeared first on Destructoid.",
