          "description": "Get Hyper.\nCave, a shoot-'em-up developer assembled from the ashes of Toaplan, was preparing to fold in 2001. The arcade scene was moving in new directions, relying on increasingly ostentatious Taikan cabinets to compete with the emerging technology of home consoles. For Cave, the 2D shoot 'em up, no matter how unerringly creative, was struggling to make the bottom line sing, and it was in large part thanks to Taiwanese company IGS that they survived another decade. Cave was so impressed with IGS's PolyGame Master arcade hardware and the bastard Donpachi entry they had created for it, that they licensed the tech to have one last charge - events that would deliver DoDonpachi DaiOuJou, its suffix loosely translating as “blissful death”.\nTsuneki Ikeda, lead programmer, video game auteur, and then the company’s public face, lamented that he could never make anything as impressive as Ikaruga. He was wrong. Over time, DaiOuJou stands not only superior to Treasure’s polarising genre hybrid, but is considered by enthusiasts to be one of the greatest games ever coded. It’s the shoot-'em-up equivalent to Capcom’s Super Street Fighter II Turbo or SNK’s King of Fighters ’98: a signifying work that does not date, and compels people decades on to play for fresh achievements. In 2015, at Shanghai’s Lie Huo arcade, the expert DaiOuJou players casually ripped through its two loops like tin foil, cigarettes dangling idly from their mouths. When questioned, all were unanimous in citing it as the apex of the bullet-hell sub-genre. And they were right. Although its difficulty is a high bar, learning to play it is also to understand its genius.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Now, the obvious caveat here is that we're talking about several games rather than just one, with the series comprised of the original Persona 5, its comprehensive Royal sibling, Persona 5 Strikers, Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight, and Persona 5 Tactica.\nStill, 10 million is nevertheless a commendable feat and just goes to show the sharp increase in the franchise's popularity. Switch owners had been clamouring for Persona 5 for years before it was finally confirmed to launch on October 21st, 2022. Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden followed in January 2023 before Persona 5 Tactica launched across all platforms on November 17th, 2023.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It’s questions like this that have driven humankind to explore the planet, the cosmos, and ourselves. And the kitchen. This irresistible drive of curiosity and the addictive high of discovery are what Outer Wilds captures so well, letting this indie game put big-name space exploration titles to shame.\nMobius Digital’s mesmerising cosmic adventure that is Outer Wilds first landed on PC and Xbox in 2019 to serious critical acclaim. Receiving plaudits around the internet and a Best Game BAFTA to boot, it’s no surprise that it topped stacks of game-of-the-year lists. It’s been a long wait for Switch gamers hoping for a port, but it’s mostly good news: the indie masterpiece has kept its magic in the jump to Nintendo’s portable – albeit with a bit of a technical struggle.

Since the NES days, he's starred in some absolute classics of the run-and-gun genre, although for every incredible game or spin-off experience Capcom has delivered, there have arguably been one or two titles that either didn't quite hit the mark or — more often — felt a little too familiar.

Even before these systems became du jour, however, shooters often required you to be good at them before you unlocked their real pleasures, whether by perfecting your rocket timing in Quake or memorising level layouts in Counter-Strike.\r\n\nThe Finals' real master stroke, I think, is that it has found a design that lets it be generous with power - even while containing an unlock system, a battle pass, and a not insignificant skill floor. Those things aren’t an obstacle between you and the childish joy of smashing the world to bits.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Hell's bells, now I feel old. If you're unfamiliar with it, it's about a girl named Anna who must escape from a mysterious island, but the whole game is presented like you're reading a book - only one that you can click on and prod with your fingers to reveal new puzzles within that text. It's very clever, especially when it occasionally asks you to rotate your device to navigate parts of its game worlds - there's an excellent bit with stairs that I won't spoil, but seriously, if you haven't played Device 6 and you own an iOS device, go and download it now. \nOnce you've done that, you should also have a look this year's Delete After Reading, which does a very good impression of it for us folks on PC, hiding smart, tactile text puzzles inside its interactive spy thriller. \nRead more",

          "description": "Naughty Dog have officially stopped development of The Last Of Us Online, a multiplayer game based on their celebrated McCarthyite (no, not that McCarthy - I mean the novelist) post-apocalyptic action-adventure. Announced in the dusty days of 2018 as a multiplayer mode for The Last Of Us: Part 2, it evolved into a standalone experience with new characters and a new setting, but Sony reportedly scaled the project back earlier this year. Naughty Dog have now formally called it quits, stating that supporting a live service project such as this would have “severely impacted” future single-player game projects. Sony never locked down platforms for The Last Of Us Online, but a PC release was surely on the cards, though I would have expected the game to launch first on PlayStation, as with the original Last Of Us and Uncharted 4.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "To celebrate Doom's 30th birthday we had a discussion about the (understandably) vaunted FPS's influence, and what games would look like without it. It seems particularly interesting today in light of the recent resurgence of Doom-style shooters, often known as \"boomer shooters\" because of their deliberately retro style and singular focus on shootin' stuff and bein' cool, much like Doom. And then the obvious solution was to just ask the devs making these games about what they think of Doom and its impact on their work.\nI reached out to developers who've worked on Turbo Overkill, Prodeus, Forgive Me Father (and Forgive Me Father 2) and almost the whole stable working at New Blood Interactive to ask them some annoyingly specific questions about Doom in the hope of getting the sort of idiosyncratic answers you get from interesting devs - and they delivered! In fact, they delivered in such quantity and quality that I've elected to just present their answers to you, rather than try to weave them together as if we were all sitting together at dinner exchanging bon mots, both for clarity and to include as much as possible in their own words. It's a fascinating and entertaining collection of thoughts.\nRead more",

I've played just a handful - certainly, far from enough to pronounce myself any kind of expert - but I do feel like I've played one of the best in the shape of Siren, a Doom II total conversion from Dithered Output, the first episode of which can be downloaded free from Itch.io.\r\n\n\r\nThe mod's overall vibe is encapsulated, I think, by the sentient vending machine you meet a short way in, just round the corner from a rec room that contains a disembodied head on tentacles, and down the corridor from a tiered canteen full of ghouls and unsympathetic men with shotguns. You ask the machine if it has any clue what's going on. It tells you that its job is to keep its mouth shut and dispense soda. Can I have a soda, then? \"No.\"\r\n\n \nRead more",

In March, Nightdive announced they were being acquired by Atari in a deal worth $10 million. In May, they released their long-anticipated remake of System Shock, in development for eight years. July brought Rise Of The Triad: Ludicrous Edition, while August saw the release of Quake 2 Remastered, and a remaster of Turok 3 arrived at the end of November. Nightdive are currently working on an overhaul of Star Wars: Dark Forces, due out in 2024. \r\n\n\r\nIn short, it's been a busy year for the remastering maestros.

As a player, you're excited by the prospect of the game to come - the sights you'll see, the challenges you'll face - and first impressions can make or break your entire perception of what a game is versus the one you had stored in your head before switching it on. For video game creators, however, a new beginning is often racked with questions. What, exactly, do you choose to show players first? How will you introduce them to something they've never seen before? And if that game is successful, how do you keep reinventing that first impression across what could be several decades? \nIn revisiting every mainline Doom game to celebrate its 30th anniversary this month, it's clear that even id's iconic shooter has wrestled with how to answer these question, and the ways it's tried to reinvent itself over the years paints a captivating portrait of a series trying to move with the times. Nowhere is this more apparent than in its opening levels. Played in close succession, crushing 30 years into not even quite three hours, what emerges isn't just the evolution of one of the all-time great PC games, but also a potted history of the FPS. So join me as we chart Doom's rise, fall and rebirth through the lens of its first stages.\nRead more",

          "description": "Confession time, readers. Before a couple of weeks ago, I had never played the original Doom. As a child, my family didn't have much money and I didn't get my first laptop until I was 16. Thus, I missed out on a lot of what are now considered PC staples. With dread, I'm often met with the accursed exclamation, \"You've not played insert game before?\" followed by a good dose of judgment. But what do you do when you need to play through a backlog of games all while keeping up-to-date with new releases for work? With games now stretching out at 100+ hours apiece, where is the time for old classics like Doom?\nFor me, approaching Doom was cathartic. Playing a game that's older than myself was certainly an experience, but I was shocked at how well it holds up. \nRead more",

It's an atmospheric and rewardingly meticulous experience that typically pits you against overwhelming numbers, where victory comes about by carefully exploiting reaction abilities, positioning your troop of weary warriors just-so, and manipulating the initiative bar. At times, for me, it's up there with Into The Breach.\nBut I do acknowledge that it's an acquired taste, not least because the narrative and extra-dimensional setting are relentlessly unpleasant - a terrible soup of mother metaphors and Penny Dreadful imagery, in which you pit clones against Silent Hill monsters, then liquefy the survivors to spawn new characters. What's the appropriate way to follow up a game like that? Ah yes, with an episodic dating sim.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Back in May when I first played Ubisoft's new Metroid-like Prince Of Persia game, The Lost Crown, ahead of its reveal at this year's Summer Game Fest, I got to sample several hours' worth of some of the early areas inside its cursed mountaintop citadel of Mount Qaf. Some of protagonist Sargon's powers had been unlocked early to give us a taste of his abilities, and on the whole, I had an exceedingly good time with it. One thing was missing though, and that was any kind of narrative framing for why Sargon was here in the first place. Sure, we'd been told ahead of time that Sargon's main mission in The Lost Crown is tracking down and saving the eponymous Prince of this game, but I didn't actually see any of this in action. Anything with the slightest whiff of story about it had been expertly excised from that initial demo build, and I was left none the wiser about how those opening hours of The Lost Crown would really play out in the final game.\nNow, I've been able to play the game from the beginning, with all the story bits slotted back in and Sargon's powers unlocked in the correct order. You may have got a glimpse of some of that stuff in the new trailer released during last week's Game Awards. In the space of two minutes, it sets the scene for Sargon's rescue mission by first introducing all of his fellow warrior mates, and then seconds later showing how they're all at each other's throats as they get increasingly turned around in Mount Qaf's labyrinth. And oh my, I can practically feel all the inevitable backstabbing from here. It's going to be delicious, I can tell, and I can't wait to slice them all six ways to Sunday when The Lost Crown comes out in January.\nRead more",

Where blocking - aka holding a button to avoid damage - is a concession to the tedious attritional undertow of many action games, parrying - aka pressing a button on cue to cancel damage and often, prep a counter - is the act of cutting through the bullshit. It passively reduces any and all visual and thematic overwhelm the game would have you experience to a question of timing. \r\n\n\r\nIn the face of a good parry mechanic, the grandest of bosses are equivalent to rank-and-file mobs. You're a monster the size of a building? You're the demonic manifestation of a protagonist's mother issues? You're capitalism incarnate? You're wielding eight chainsaws at once? Ehhh. I'm not just going to survive your onslaught. I'm going to dismiss it. All of it: your absurd DPS, your multiple elemental modifiers, your screen-blanketing special effects, your overcooked core concept, the very laws of physics - poof, gone, as though they had never been. Blocking is akin to maintaining a poker face while you're being harangued by your boss over Zoom. Parrying is politely pointing out that your boss has left his camera on, and that he should probably wear trousers when he's at work. It is \"nope\" said so quietly that it shuts everything else up. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "\"Consider yourself warned! This book contains scenes of graphic violence!\" These are the words that adorn the Doom comic book, which was originally released for promotional purposes during 1996's E3 by GT Interactive and Marvel Comics. \"Knee-deep in the dead!\" is the next bit of text below the logo, referencing the name of the first shareware Doom episode and beautifully describing the blood-soaked cover illustration by Tom Grindberg, who was apparently tickled enough at the thought of drawing this monstrosity to take time away from working on 2000 AD.\nThe cover is an accurate peek at the gore and demonic entrails that lie within this epic work of sequential storytelling, which required the writing skills of not one, but two gentlemen - Steve \"Body Bag\" Behling and Michael \"Splatter\" Stewart. Both Behling and Stewart have a decent body of work between them at Marvel, where they've penned more civilised fare starring the likes of Ant-Man and The Hulk. The Doom comic, in comparison, seems to have been a thing that was written in a fever dream, and DoomWorld, which lovingly hosts scans of this brisk read to this day, describes it appropriately: \"Some time in 1996 a couple of guys got together and smoked what was apparently a large amount of crack and then injected pure heroin into their eyes and then proceeded to create what is now known only as 'the Doom comic.'\"\nRead more",

          "description": "Legendary-tier monster cards on the table time: I do not like video game loot. I think that the popularity of \"looting\", an English word itself looted from Hindi during the time of the East India Company, is one of the worst aspects of the modern games industry and especially of the blockbuster live service game, which strives to keep its audience coming back by means of fresh loot injections at regular intervals.\nI distrust how the randomisation element of much video game looting flirts with actual gambling mechanics. I hate that structuring games around the acquisition of loot creates a framework and an appetite for microtransactions and arguably, NFTs. But I am kind of fascinated by the art of designing loot, and especially when it comes to action RPGs such as Diablo 4 and Path Of Exile 2, because it seems to trade on some irresolvable contradictions.\nRead more",

It shows a couple of players scavenging a post-pandemic American city slick with detailed lighting effects and reactive zombie hordes. There's crafting, cracked glass, and even a horror tease as a player peers around a corridor with a torch. It was an MMO that promised a mixture of The Last Of Us and The Division, and it quickly became the most wishlisted game on Steam.\nNow, days after releasing into early access, developers Fntastic have shut down and you can't purchase the game anymore. Does it come as a surprise? Not really, considering the final product wasn't what they promised - not even close. Instead of an MMO, it was barely an extraction shooter. Consider my words below a record of a rancid time had across its short-lived early access release, then. A time when I would've rather handed a stinging nettle £40 to line my socks than spend another minute in this empty husk.\nRead more",

          "description": "Banishers: Ghosts Of New Eden is a game of twos. It has two protagonists and two broad ways of playing, leading to two broad narrative outcomes, and is created by a company who, as Don’t Nod’s lead narrative designer Elise Galmard explained to me at a preview event, feel like they make games for two different audiences - fans of noodly narrative intrigues on the one hand, and of fantasy combat games on the other. Among the game's challenges, of course, is to blend these halves convincingly.\nA spiritual (hah) follow-up of sorts to 2018’s fairly well-received Vampyr, it takes place in the alt-historical realm of New Eden, which is kind of 17th century colonial North America through the lens of Dragon Age: Inquisition with a pinch of Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice. The titular Banishers are a ghost-hunting couple, the Scotsman Red MacRaith and the Cuban Antea Duarte. Antea is killed at the very beginning of the game, during a battle with an especially noxious spook, but she soon returns as a spirit, and your overall story objective is to either resurrect her body or help her \"Ascend\" to the afterlife.\nRead more",

          "description": "In just over a month's time, the entire mainline Ace Attorney series will finally be playable on PC with the arrival of the Apollo Justice Trilogy. Launching on January 25th 2024, this collection bundles together the fourth, fifth and sixth games in Capcom's excellent lawyer 'em up - Apollo Justice, Dual Destinies and Spirit Of Justice - which originally launched on the Nintendo DS and 3DS across a ten year period between 2007 and 2016. It's been funny revisiting the earlier cases of these games after so much time has passed. Apollo's name may be the one on the box, but the series' original cover star Phoenix Wright is never far from the front lines - not only does he get tangled up on the wrong side of the law in Apollo's own debut outing, but he's back as a full-time defence attorney on the (w)right side of the legal bench in the other two. \nAt the time, poor old Apollo always felt like he got the short end of the stick as Capcom tried to figure out what to do with the series, and to some extent, he still does - for he never quite gets out from under Phoenix's shadow to completely hold court on his own two feet. But now, after 2021's excellent Great Ace Attorney Chronicles proved that neither time, setting or its lead defence need to be set in stone for the series to carry on, the pressure does feel ever so slightly less intense on a second visit. There's no denying Apollo still has a bit of an uphill climb on his hands, but if, like me, you've been waiting for these games to be freed from their Nintendo-bound prison, this is arguably the best glow-up Capcom's done to the series to date. \nRead more",

The cottage isn't just mobile - you can expand it with second-floor extensions and decorate the interior with jaunty wooden furniture. Sadly, there doesn't appear to be an option to employ gingerbread during construction, nor can you currently fly about on broomstick, but perhaps all that'll be added on the road to 1.0.

That became apparent when Romero’s new autobiography, ‘Doom Guy: Life In First Person’, showed up on shelves with a glowing back cover quote from Carmack. The latter praised Romero’s “remarkable memory”, and waxed wistfully about their shared impact on the gaming medium. “For years, I thought that I had been born too late and missed out on participating in the heroic eras of computing,” Carmack wrote. “Only much later did I realise that Romero and I were at the nexus of a new era - the 3D game hackers.”\nRead more",

There has been some negative feedback, however, from players upset that player movement is now slower than it was during the beta.\r\n\nExcept, it's not slower, say the developers - there have been no changes to the movement system at all. Instead they're investigating why it apparently feels slower, and say they've found the culprits.\r\n\n \nRead more",

This build includes a 12th-gen Core i5 processor, 16GB of DDR4 memory, a 1TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD and a 750W power supply, all for £500 off its listed price. \nRead more",

To by dávalo smysl, kdyby se pro elektronické spisové služby cena atestace dle nového standardu nezvýšila téměř sedmkrát. Atestace stávajících systémů na trhu tak bude stát z původních 75 tisíc Kč přesně 489 tisíc Kč. Proč? Protože je náročné prověřit nové (vylepšené) XML standardy pro elektronické spisové služby. Chyby i nejasnosti se řeší v GitHubu. Kdo to zaplatí? Zákazník. Jak to bude fungovat? No musí.",

One is great for an explorative and relaxing experience that's typically a one-and-done. The other, meanwhile, provides an adrenaline boost that gets many repeat playthroughs in vain attempts to scratch the skill ceiling.\n\n\nFrom this perspective, examining CreSpirit and GemaYue's latest collaboration TEVI seems contradictory but not unwelcome. It advertises itself as a Metroidvania/bullet hell mash-up, and it's a concept I adore, despite my mindset on both genres. The cute anime art style and developer's existing pedigree with Rabi-Ribi only served as the icing on the cake. TEVI is even sold as Rabi-Ribi's successor due to having the same genre mash-up and GemaYue's return.\n\n\nWhile I never played Rabi-…",

Last year Games Workshop and Amazon Studios announced they were working on an agreement, and a year later it is now a done deal. Warhammer fan and actor Henry Cavill had been linked to the project after it was revealed he would no longer be playing Geralt of Rivia in The Witcher. It now looks like he will in fact be part of the process as an Executive Producer.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the community post, everything is still in the early stages but is now officially underway. Creative details are the focus now as the first script is being written and pushed into production. The post goes on to claim that an elite band of screenwriters with their own passions for Warhammer have been assembled to bring the various stories of Warhammer 40,000 to TV and movies. All led by Henry Cavill as Executive Producer who will be \"bringing his pen, sword and/or spear to the project.\"\n\n\nWhile it's clear anything tangible is still a way out, this is awesome news. Warhammer 40,000 is an insanely lore-rich IP and I'm honestly surprised it has taken this long. I assume one of the first things we'll see is the Eisenhorn series as it would make for a perfect television saga. What Warhammer 40,000 series do you want to see made into film?\n\nThe post Games Workshop and Amazon officially bringing Warhammer to the big screen appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It's always the ones you don't expect, right? In a year full of AAA powerhouses competing for the top spot, I'm actually not too surprised that Lethal Company managed to sneak in and steal hearts. Thousands of them, even.\n\n\nIt was actually a narrow competition this year for our newly founded indie game category. Intended as a way to get more independent games involved in the conversations we have at the end of every year, we wound up with an intriguing mix of games.\n\n\nChained Echoes was a holdover from last December, but still retained more staying power than most early-year launches. And World of Horror's full launch finally arrived, leaving a mark on us. But Lethal Company's recent surge seems to be the note we're ending 2023 on.\n\n\n\n\nThe co-op horror might, at first, seem familiar. It re…",

          "description": "Entourage star Kevin Dillon has given us some sad news today. James McCaffrey, known for his role as the voice of the titular character from the Max Payne series has died at 65. TMZ reports that McCaffrey passed away as a result of a battle with multiple myeloma.\n\n\nMcCaffrey first made his debut as a video game voice actor in 2001’s Max Payne. While he stayed close with Remedy, voicing roles in the Alan Wake games and Control, he also acted as Edward Carnby in 2006’s Alone in the Dark reboot. Beyond that, he starred in a number of TV and film roles going back 35 years.\n\n\nRemedy has also given their condolences, stating, “We are deeply saddened to hear about the passing of our beloved friend and collaborator James McCaffrey, the iconic voice of Max Payne and Alex Casey. His remarkable talent not only gave life to our characters but also left an enduring impact on our community. Our hearts go out to his family in this time of loss.”\n\n\n\n\nWhile his list of roles in video game voice acting is somewhat short, his impact was massive. As Max, McCaffrey gave life to the character’s melancholic, neo-noir brooding, even providing motion capture animation in Max Payne 3. In the same way I have trouble hearing Batman without the voice of Kevin Conroy, I can’t imagine Max without McCaffrey behind the vocals. This has been a sad year when it comes to who we’ve lost in the industry, both in terms of their contributions to beloved characters and those behind the scenes who make it happen. \n\n\nSam Lake, who provided the face for Max in the first game, perhaps said it best on Twitter: “He was a key part of the Remedy family. He was a brilliant actor. No one could do what he did better than him.”\n\n\nLead image via Remedy.\n\nThe post Max Payne voice actor James McCaffrey dies at 65 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Chris Avellone, the former chief creative officer and co-founder of Fallout: New Vegas developer Obsidian Entertainment, has revealed that the company tried to make an Elder Scrolls game in a similar vein. In a thread confirming an old tweet uncovered by 80 Level, Avellone discussed details about the proposal.\n\n\n\n\nHe also compared the idea to the way Infinity Ward and Treyarch handled alternate Call of Duty games during that generation, with Bethesda developing a main game and Obsidian working on something that would offer more Elder Scrolls adventures, like Fallout: New Vegas did for that series. \n\n\nAccording to Avellone, the idea didn't gain traction with Bethesda, and he suggests that the Starfield studio wasn't happy with the reception that Fallout: New Vegas received, \"good and bad.\"\n\n\nAlthough Fallout: New Vegas has become highly regarded over the years since its release, there was initially some backlash toward the game due to bugs and game breaking issues. \n\n\nAfter years of patches and updates, Fallout: New Vegas has gotten the recognition that it deserves. It's disappointing to think of what we could have had if this had ultimately panned out. It has been over a decade since The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim was released, and it doesn't look like we'll get to play The Elder Scrolls VI anytime soon. \n\n\nIf only we had an Obsidian-developed Elder Scrolls game to fill the decade plus gap between releases. It seems like Bethesda missed a trick with that one. Maybe Obsidian's (remarkably Elder Scrolls looking) fantasy RPG, Avowed, can fill that hole in my heart.\n\nThe post Fallout New Vegas dev says studio once pitched an Elder Scrolls spin-off appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Lethal Company has enjoyed enormous success since it launched just a couple of months ago. From smashing its player record not long after releasing to being the top-selling game on Steam (where it still sits), it's been quite the journey for indie developer Zeekerss. Now, the title could walk away with one of gaming's greatest honors.\n\n\nThe Steam Awards recently revealed the player-voted nominations for this year. With categories such as Labor of Love, Best Game on Steam Deck, Most Innovative Gameplay, and more, there's a lot of competition about. However, it's seeing Lethal Company up for Game of the Year that's most intriguing.\n\n\n\n\nObviously, we're aware of just how successful the release has been, but it says something that it's able to go up against the likes of Baldur's Gate 3 and Resident Evil 4. Those are some elbows Zeekerss' game is rubbing against, and it'll be interesting to see whether it can come out on top against such names.\n\n\nSomething of an underdog story\n\n\nIn a world of AAA flexing and classic releases being given a new lease on life in the form of remakes and remasters, it's tough for independent games to stand out. Whether Lethal Company takes the Game of the Year award away or not doesn't detract from the fact that it was nominated in the first place.\n\n\nAt the time of writing, it's still going strong, and I have – rather ashamedly – still not got round to playing it.\n\n\nIf you want to vote on your favorite in each of the Steam Awards categories, you can do so from December 21 (when the Steam Winter sale begins). Voting will close at 10am PT on January 2, so you've got the holiday period to make your choices.\n\nThe post Lethal Company is up for Game of the Year at The Steam Awards appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Last week, we witnessed another series of layoffs as Free Radical Design closed its doors. With that reported bombshell coming to fruition, we likely lost the potential for a new TimeSplitters game. However, images appearing to show what-could-have-been have been leaked.\n\n\nAccording to a number of posts on Twitter (as spotted by Eurogamer), concept art and early screenshots from the elusive TimeSplitters revival have made an appearance. User @ithedestrxyer shows some character models, while an account called TimeSplitters News & Archives has uploaded general art work.\n\n\n\n\nThese have been credited to the now-defunct Free Radical Design, which was the studio that's been behind the series since day one. More have been curated on the fandom page, each of which has been given attributes for their respective artists.\n\n\nDare to dream\n\n\nWe can't say for sure whether these are legitimate images from the game, but if they are, then they certainly act as a tease. With the developer shutting down entirely, the future of TimeSplitters remains uncertain.\n\n\nThe former studio was under the Embracer Group umbrella, so the parent company will likely have to make a decision about whether to revive the dormant franchise going forward.\n\n\nOf course, with Free Radical now out of the picture, any hope of a brand-new entry will come with the caveat that it won't be made by the original creators. Still, a lot of people would love to see TimeSplitters make a comeback and these recent images (if they do belong to the game) could encourage Embracer to continue the project, or maybe even sell it to another company.\n\nThe post TimeSplitters art work appears to be doing the rounds post-Free Radical closure appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Movies and games have always had an ambivalent relationship. Gaming's the new kid on the block, and it seems pathologically obsessed with clinging onto Hollywoodesque tropes and presentation styles. Nevertheless, with its flourishing popularity, the gaming industry does occasionally show deep-seated desires to forge an independent identity.\n\n\n\nFMV games complicate the situation further. They're not quite movies, as you're invited to interact with the story. On the other hand, when you have live-action scenes in your game, it's understandable to feel like you're engaging with the work of folks who'd much rather be on film sets. \n\n\n\n\nStubbornly resistant to concrete categories, FMVs exist in a liminal space populated with both potential and pitfalls.

          "description": "In sad news for anyone who enjoys fan games and remakes of retro titles, Nintendo has shut down a fan-made The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening PC port. \n\n\nEurogamer reported on this disappointing turn of events for the Zelda fangame community, and reiterating its features only makes its loss sting. The Link's Awakening PC port included some lovely features, including supporting up to 120 frames per second, widescreen, and zooming options that could let you see virtually the entire world map at once. That still doesn't change how ardently protective Nintendo is over its properties, so it called for the game be pulled from Itch's pages.\n\n\nAccording to the Nintendo representative who sent the notice of infringement, \"It has come to our attention that the following game, https://linksawakeningdxhd.itch.io/links-awakening-dx-hd, offered on Itch.io infringes and makes unauthorized use of Nintendo’s copyrights in The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening video game.\"\n\n\nAny downloads for the Link's Awakening port are no longer available on its Itch.io page. Its takedown is a shame, but not a surprise.\n\n\n\n\nNintendo is infamous for its ironclad control over its IPs, with well-documented fights with other fan projects. There are plenty of cases in the past of projects like this gradually picking up internet infamy, then receiving a cease-and-desist.\n\n\nWhile Nintendo's within its legal rights to go after these projects, it's sad to see interesting projects like these go. Link's Awakening is still available on Switch, either through the remake or Switch Online's Game Boy collection.\n\nThe post Fan-made Link’s Awakening PC port has been taken down by Nintendo appeared first on Destructoid.",

Upfront, it's a big meaty game. So I think that should be able to exist as it is. This is what allows us to continue making other games.\"\n\n\nWith the average Baldur's Gate 3 playthrough running for at least 50 hours (according to player data aggregated by HowLongToBeat) Vincke definitely has a point there. My own run took me 107 hours, and I  ignored a whole bunch of side quests and points of interest in Act 3.\n\n\nLarian doesn't seem inclined to give up Xbox's market potential for a Game Pass deal with Microsoft, and given the game's overwhelming success, it's no wonder.\n\n\n\n\nStill, Xbox fans might find it disappointing that the studio is dismissing the possibility altogether. Vincke, who recently released his full Game of the Year acceptance speech, certainly isn't mincing words when he talks about knowing what their game is really worth. \n\n\nWhile Baldur's Gate 3 took home multiple trophies at The Game Awards and has received a lot of acclaim, it's easy to see how some might still be wary of spending $70 if they're not not an initiate of the CRPG genre or Dungeons & Dragons itself. \n\n\nA Game Pass demo might have gone a long way toward alleviating those fears.

It seems evident that we should never forget the classics. And that's exactly what this one modder is doing with the original RE2.\n\n\nPerhaps in an attempt to blend modern Resident Evil with the retro installments, Itch.io user PerroAutonomo has been remaking the second game in the series. Only, they aren't updating the visuals or the cheesy dialogue. No. They're sticking with how the original 1998 release looked, but have made it into a first-person shooter.\n\n\n\n\nThe above video from the YouTube channel Residence of Evil does a half hour playthrough of the demo. As for when the full thing will be released, PerroAutonomo's page says they may not finish it, and the current build \"has many errors\" (translated by Google).\n\n\nComplete with fully remade cut scenes\n\n\nThe footage shows how authentic this unofficial remake is. It endeavors to keep the visual style of Resident Evil 2 but chooses a different perspective. We get to see a lot of the game from new angles never seen before, and even though it's a fan project, it's still impressive to see.\n\n\nAs Capcom marches forward with its iconic survival horror series, we welcome whatever's on the horizon. With more Resident Evil remakes being confirmed, everyone's going to be wondering which one's going to get the remake treatment next.\n\n\nWe may well get to see a fresh take on one of the spin-offs, such as Code Veronica or Umbrella Chronicles. Or maybe RE5 will get another crack at not being a disappointment. Time will tell on that front. \n\nThe post This Resident Evil 2 fan remake turns the classic into an FPS appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s coming to Switch, PS4, PS5, Steam, iOS, and Android.\n\n\nWhile a new SaGa entry was talked about as far back as 2021, SaGa: Emerald Beyond was only officially announced in the September 2023 Nintendo Direct. It’s the latest from the long-running series, dating back to 1989 with Makai Toushi SaGa or The Final Fantasy Legend. You don’t have to have been following the series since then, as this one is supposedly standalone.\n\n\n\n\nSaGa: Emerald Beyond is an RPG where you take control of six protagonists and explore 17 interconnected worlds. It features a branching storyline based on the choices you make. The combat is turn-based, with a great deal of emphasis put on the timeline, which tracks turn order. From the look of it, it’s similar to Fuga: Melodies of Steel, where your success is determined partially by how you can maximize your speed while delaying the enemy.\n\n\nI’ve never gotten into the SaGa series, mainly because I don’t really know where to start. I’ve played The Final Fantasy Legend, but dropped off partway through. I’m not sure sequentially is the right move here. However, SaGa: Emerald Beyond looks rad as heck, with some great character design and imaginative worlds.\n\n\nSaGa: Emerald Beyond releases on April 25, 2024 on Switch, PS4, PS5, Steam, iOS, and Android.\n\nThe post Square Enix announces that SaGa: Emerald Beyond will release April 25 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Some big plot points have leaked online, and naturally, developer Rocksteady isn’t happy.\nApparently, the leaks stem from a closed beta test in which audio from a pivotal story cutscene plus images and a video showing yet-to-be-revealed characters got out in the wild. We won’t share the details, but they’re not hard to find, so you’re on your own if you want to know more. We just ask that you refrain from posting any spoilers in the comments out of respect for others who wish to remain in the dark.\nRocksteady has posted a statement on its X account addressing the leaks, which we've posted in full below. \nIt’s always a bummer to see leaks of this nature happen, and with Suicide Squad still two months away from launch, interested players who want to be surprised have several weeks of dodging spoilers before they can see the story for themselves. \nSuicide Squad: Kill the Justice League takes place several years after the end of Batman: Arkham Knight and stars Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Captain Boomerang, and King Shark, tasked with defending Earth from a brainwashed Justice League, courtesy of Brainiac. The cooperative open-world adventure has received a lot of vitriol from fans for its shooter-based gameplay, always-online requirement, and live service elements, such as its battle pass. \nYou can watch the game’s most recent trailer from the 2023 Game Awards here.",

This remake, which will be called The One Piece, is an anime adaptation of the manga version of the East Blue saga, meaning it will likely vary from the ongoing One Piece anime. \nBeyond this announcement video, Netflix hasn't revealed much else about The One Piece, so casting and its release remain unknown. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's One Piece Odyssey review.",

          "description": "Marvel's Blade was one of the most exciting reveals from the Game Awards. Not only is it the first proper video game adaptation of the beloved Marvel character, but it's being made by Arkane Lyon, developers of games like Deathloop and the Dishonored series. That said, the reveal trailer isn't that long, and fans are understandably hungry for more.\nLuckily for them, co-creative director/art director Sébastien Mitton revealed a few images of concept art on X today. These images were created by Sergey Kolesov and Jean-Luc Monnet, and you can see them for yourself below:\n\nConcept art is mainly made to establish a general artistic tone and vibe of a game, so it doesn't always include details present in the finished product. That said, we can infer a lot about the tone of the game based on these images. The dense city streets and subways certainly evoke Arkane's environmental design, and Blade's positions up high and in the shadows suggest stealthy problem-solving, another recurring aspect of Arkane's games.\nFor more Blade, check out our episode of the GI show where we recap the biggest announcements from the Game Awards, or just watch the reveal trailer again.",

The remasters of the series’ defining trilogy are now available on iOS, Android, and Netflix.\nLike all Netflix titles, subscribers have immediate access to the Definitive Edition, which consists of modernized remasters of GTA III, Vice City, and San Andreas. On mobile, you can pick them up in the Trilogy bundle or purchase them individually.\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition first launched for consoles and PCs in November of 2021, while the mobile version was originally planned to launch in early 2022. These improved versions of the 2000s-era classics feature high-resolution textures, advanced lighting/weather effects, and modernized controls (modeled after GTA V), among other bells and whistles. However, due to the player complaints stemming from the collection’s poor launch state, the mobile version was hit with a lengthy delay as Rockstar worked to improve the released versions. \nIn addition to the launch of The Trilogy, Grand Theft Auto VI was announced for a 2025 release. You can watch the game’s debut trailer here.",

It features a good bit of story content that acts as an epilogue to the events of Ragnarok, and it's packaged within a roguelite structure, meaning it's heavy on combat. Apparently, there's an endgame challenge in Valhalla so difficult that nobody on the dev team could complete it on the DLC's \"Show Me Mastery\" difficulty, according to Valhalla's director Mihir Sheth. \n\"I am so, so curious to see how quickly players will humble us...as they often do...but maybe this time we've beaten them?\" Sheth writes on Twitter, as first reported by Wccftech. \nThere is an endgame challenge in #GodOfWarRagnarokValhalla that no one on the dev team has completed on the hardest difficulty 'Show Me Mastery'.\nDecember 12, 2023\nGod of War  Ragnarök, the sequel to 2018's God of War reboot, hit PS5 and PS4 more than a year ago – read Game Informer's review to find out why it was one of our favorite games of 2022. While many fans expected some kind of follow-up to the ending of  Ragnarök, be it a sequel down the road or an expansion, it's safe to say nobody had roguelite DLC on their bingo cards. But a roguelite DLC called Valhalla is exactly what developer Santa Monica Studios announced last week. Now, God of War Ragnarok's Valhalla DLC is out and apparently has the hardest challenge in the entire series. \nYou can watch us tackle the first hour of  God of War Ragnarök: Valhalla in this episode of Game Informer Live. \nAre you playing God of War Ragnarok's Valhalla DLC?

          "description": "Mouse, an upcoming classic first-person shooter sporting a vintage rubber hose animation style, turned heads in May with its first look at gameplay. Although that initial showing was very much a work in progress, today’s video offers a more polished look at what’s to come.\nThe noir game stars a private-eye rodent cleaning up his corruption-riddled city by using his trusty tommy gun to mow down scores of mouse gangsters in cartoonishly violent fashion. Additionally, we get a look at other lethal methods, such as tossing dynamite, shooting down pianos to crash on top of foes, or just knocking goons' heads off with a good punch. Between all of that, the mouse protagonist consumes spinach and tea for presumably health while engaging in other activities such as collecting baseball cards and chatting with characters.\nMouse is the debut title from developer Fumi Games, and the trailer ends with the reveal of a 2025 release window. \n\n\nMouse is slated to come to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. It joins the growing ranks of confirmed 2025 titles such as Grand Theft Auto VI, Monster Hunter: Wilds, Big Walk, Usual June, and Pony Island 2: Panda Circus.",

The last in-person E3 conference happened in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic and other complications prevented it from coming back in full form since. Despite struggles, the ESA attempted to bring E3 back in various ways. \nIt was canceled in 2020 as a result of the pandemic; the 2021 E3 was an all-digital event; the 2022 show was canceled, and this year's attempt with PAX organizer ReedPop was canned, too. \npic.twitter.com/y6dtVkBvNI\nDecember 12, 2023\n\"After more than two decades of hosting an event that has served as a central showcase for the U.S. and global video game industry, the Entertainment Software Association has decided to bring E3 to a close,\" ESA president and CEO Stanely Pierre-Louis told The Washington Post. \"We know the entire industry, players and creators alike have a lot of passion for E3. We share the passion. We know it's difficult to say goodbye to such a beloved event, but it's the right thing to do given the new opportunities our industry has to reach fans and partners.\" \nPierre-Louis told The Washington Post that E3's closure means video games and the surrounding business \"has blossomed in different ways,\" noting that any of the major game companies can create their own individual showcases. He's likely alluding to the format popularized by Nintendo with its Nintendo Directs, which other publishers like Xbox and PlayStation utilize now. \"That's exciting for our industry, and it means it's an opportunity for them to explore how to engage new audiences in different ways.\" \nFor a recap of the history of E3, read The Washington Post's full story here.

More specifically, it will hit the Nintendo console on December 18, as revealed in a new trailer you can watch below. \nWhile many simulation games task you with creating a new metropolis or saving a colony of humans from post-apocalyptic conditions, Terra Nil instead tasks you with saving nature from climate change and the effects of humans. Instead of building roadways and buildings, you build windmills, calcifiers, and more. \n\n\nAs you can see, Terra Nil is not only a unique spin on the simulation genre, but a pretty one. It's sure to pop on Nintendo Switch OLED models, too, if you have one. \nIf you're unsure whether or not the game is for you, read Game Informer's Terra Nil review to learn what we thought about it.

Nonetheless, it was the subject of many top trending searches on Google. \nAs for what that means, Google describes it like so: \"This data shows the top trending searches in the U.S., which means the 'trending' inquiries are the searches that had such a high spike in traffic over a sustained period in 2023 as compared to 2022.\" \nWith that in mind, here's the top 10 trending searches in the U.S. for games on Google in 2023: \nHogwarts Legacy – Our Review\nConnections (if you, like me, didn't know what this was, it's a New York Times word grouping puzzle game) \nBaldur's Gate 3 – Our Review\nStarfield – Our Review\nDiablo IV – Our Review\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – Our Review\nAtomic Heart – Our Review\nDead Island 2 – Our Review\nSons of the Forest\nMortal Kombat 1 – Our Review\nAnd here are the top 10 trending searches in the world for games on Google in 2023: \nHogwarts Legacy\nThe Last of Us\nConnections\nBattlegrounds Mobile India\nStarfield\nBaldur's Gate 3\nスイカ ゲーム (a Japanese puzzle game known as Suika Game or Watermelon Game)\nDiablo IV\nAtomic Heart\nSons of the Forest\nDo any of these surprise you?

          "description": "The Game Awards are packed with eager looks at highly anticipated games, but the ceremony is full of plenty of surprises too. One of them is a flashy Metroidvania called Tales of Kenzera: Zau, the debut game from Surgent Studios.\nZau is a boy on a quest to bring his father back from the dead. Guided by Kalunga, the God of Death, he uses his ability as a warrior shaman to defeat the ancestral spirits that roam the land of Kenzera. His main tools are a pair of magical masks; with the Moon mask he can manipulate time and crystalize enemies, and the Sun mask allows him to launch fiery spears. Studio founder Abubakar Salim says that the two masks are reminiscent of the Devil May Cry series with the way they allow the player to flip between ranged and melee modes.\n\nThe world is inspired by Bantu lore and imagery, with bright colors and mythical beasts. Additionally, the game will be scored by Nainita Desai, a British composer who made the music for Half Mermaid's Telling Lies and Immortality.\nSalim founded Surgent in 2019, but most gamers would currently recognize him as the voice of Bayek from Assassin's Creed Origins. According to him, the passing of his father motivated him to create a new project – he wanted to tell a story of grief in the form of a video game. With assistance from the Ridley Scott Creative Group and Critical Role, five years later, Tales of Kenzera: Zau tells that story.\nThe trailer ended with the news that Tales of Kenzera: Zau will be coming to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on April 23, 2024.",

By using our affiliate links to buy your favorite games, you granted us a small commission from GOG.com – without having to spend more than the original price.\nEarlier this year, GOG.com announced the discontinuation of its old affiliate program. Instead of using a simple referral link, they are now using two external affiliation networks that contain cross-site tracking, as considered by many ad blockers. Since we have been affiliated with GOG.com since 2009, we were able to use the legacy referral links for a couple of months after they initially discontinued them.\nUnfortunately, our affiliate links were put to rest effective November 22nd, 2023.\nSince we don't feel comfortable that you would have to use external affiliation networks just to support the project, and because tracking users is against our project policies, we decided not to join the new program.\nWe still value GOG.com as an excellent source for legally purchasing games supported by ScummVM. Even though we are not affiliated with them anymore, we'll continue to support their releases, e.g. by adding and updating the game data files' signatures for the ScummVM supported games that are available for purchase from GOG.com in our detection database and providing links to their releases in our list of available games.\nThank you GOG.com and everybody who used our affiliate link for your support over the last 14 years!\n>",
