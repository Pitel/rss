Tears of the Kingdom aside, there has mostly been only a handful of months between the initial announcement and the release of many of the company's major software titles.\nThe same, however, cannot be said for Metroid Prime 4. Initially announced on June 13th, 2017 (nearly 7 years ago), the game's development was rebooted exactly 5 years ago, with an announcement posted on Nintendo's YouTube channel on January 25th, 2019 from Nintendo EPD's Shinya Takahashi (thanks, Stealth).\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

We'd be pretty confident assuming that a crossover isn't coming our way anytime soon, but if the last few years have proven one thing, it's that you can never rule out the hacking community.\n'Resident Evil Kart' is a new ROM hack from SNES hacker MrL314 which brings the two series together in the most challenging way possible. No, this isn't Jill Valentine speeding around Moo Moo Meadows (as much as we'd love to see that), instead, it takes Resident Evil's classic perspective shots — the fixed camera angles — and adds them to Super Mario Kart.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Well, long-time Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma has been spotted alongside Shigeru Miyamoto wearing construction gear. Gasp!

Nabbing a 9/10 score in our review, it quickly became one of those very special games that we just straight-up refuse to ever delete off our SD cards. Still easily one of the console's best fighters, it's a slick and addictive work of indie art that only missed out on a perfect score due to some very disappointing online issues. And hey, now it's got a sequel!\nYep, UNDER NIGHT IN-BIRTH II Sys:Celes (herein referred to as 'UNI2' because we're down with the kids) sees you return to a world where humans ravaged by the 'Hollow Night' (scary void monsters) become In-Births. In-Births gain the ability to control a power known as EXS, and that's how...well, that's how they fight so good. We don't understand much more of the story in all honesty, beyond this and the fact there's a 500-year-old girl named Linne knocking about, we're just happy that we understand what the franchise's crazy name is all about now.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Lament of the Pal gamer.\nLess than a week out from its launch in Early Access on Steam and Xbox, Palworld has proved itself to be a massive commercial success for developer Pocketpair and has dominated gaming discourse online since the weekend. Switch gamers can't access it on Nintendo's console, of course, but with its aesthetic parallels to Pokémon, it's been the main talking point for many of us as we await the first Nintendo Direct of the year and the inevitable Pokémon Presents showcase at the end of February.\nPalworld's well-worn 'Pokémon-with-guns' descriptor, coupled with a very successful marketing campaign — seriously, it feels like this was Promoted in our feeds for the last decade — has led to downloads in the millions and fiery debate online, with legions of fans coming to its defence from allegations of plagiarism and asset theft. These accusations suggest that Pocketpair — who has form when it comes to making games which look an awful lot like other games — may have taken its search for inspiration too far in this case, with certain Pal models that appear too close to certain Pokémon counterparts to be coincidence.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

In fact, many consider Blood Money to be the progenitor of World of Assassination; a game that thrives on freedom of choice, offering up a total of 14 excellent sandboxes, from a Chilean vineyard to the White House.\nThis re-release on Switch, dubbed Hitman: Blood Money - Reprisal, is a straightforward port of the original, retaining the same controls and visuals with slight tweaks to the user interface. What Feral Interactive has done, however, is take a few cues from IO’s more modern Hitman titles and introduce a few quality-of-life updates for players who might not have joined Agent 47 back in 2006.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Far from forgotten, there have been in the past two re-releases/remasters of the game on console, one on Game Boy Advance back in 2005 and 3DS in 2014. Is this third HD revisit — based on the 2018 PC release — worth its price in coal or is it just a load of hot air? Strap in to find out.\nThe action takes place in a familiar yet bizarre post-industrial revolution civilisation during a great war waged between the nations of the Republic of Silverhead and the Motorhead Empire (no smirking in the back, now). In this alternate 19th century, the steam engine has become the world’s greatest invention causing military machine design to evolve into gigantic monsters of steel and fire that rule the land, the sea. and the skies. You take the role of a nameless Silverhead republican pilot onboard the aircraft carrier Rheinhalt. Despite being greatly outnumbered, the technology of Silverhead is more advanced than their opponent, evident through your choice of aircraft and the mighty 'Imamio Thunder' bomb devices that can cause devastating damage to the steel-dependent Motorhead military units.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

As per the roguelike element, it's a game about being on the run. \r\n\n\r\nIn Roots, you take charge of a band of warriors fleeing an expanding purple smog, the Ginnungagap, in a flying longship. To escape its coils, you must land on floating islands, play cards to raise settlements, and harvest energy for your vessel from the titular roots of the World Tree. Succumb to the advancing mists, and you'll time-rewind back to your Holt to unlock new mechanics and upgrades. There are also various big-league mythological celebrities to meet and recruit, and a variety of randomised encounters and events to shake up each run. Here's the launch trailer.\r\n\n Read more",

Great building, a sense of scale, a beautiful atmosphere, and the ability to die in extremely stupid ways. In Minecraft, it's digging straight down into lava. In Valheim, it's getting crushed by the very tree you'd just chopped down. And after dying for the third time by trying to climb a slightly-too-steep hill, slipping down and building enough momentum to send me careening off the cliff to my death, I realised that Enshrouded, too, ticks all the boxes for maybe one day being listed among the titans of the genre.\nOne paragraph in, and I've already compared Enshrouded to Valheim. You'll see that quite a bit throughout this review, and for good reason. Enshrouded has come the closest for me to recapturing that feeling of when the world collectively discovered Valheim for the first time. But that's both an accolade and a reservation. Because it's not quite there... yet.\n Read more",

          "description": "Basically the only sort of strategy games I like are city builders, so I was interested in the playtest for El Dorado: The Golden City Builder, which casts you as the leader of an ancient Mayan-ish city. The playtest is only the prologue, but the eventual goal is to take over the Yucatán peninsula, and if nothing else it's refreshing to see a city-builder that doesn't feel overwhelmingly European. It also has a complicated system of religion. Whereas in a similarly polytheistic game like Zeus, the gods would turn up to stomp on buildings and/or bless them, at fairly large intervals, in El Dorado I was getting a home immolated every few days. Building shrines that have an area of effect, and that require resources to run and protect your town, is its own supply chain in El Dorado. This is a very interesting idea that I liked.\nBut. The aforementioned deities are figures from Maya mythology, and the Yucatán peninsula is the bit where the Mayans lived, so I just find it a bit sus the word \"Mayan\" does not appear anywhere on the Steam page or in the press release materials. Sometimes said materials say \"the Yucatán peninsula\", and sometimes \"the mystical land of Jukatan\", which could well be an innocent translation mistake, but doesn't make me less sus. I've hedged my bets by saying \"Mayan-ish\" - just as an uncharitable person could say the devs are doing...\nRead more",

Nope, this one was even more sinister, and I absolutely refuse to unlock it. \nRead more",

          "description": "For a series that's defined by its trials and elaborate murder cases, the greatest crime in Ace Attorney history is arguably one we never get to see or take part in. Okay, maybe crime is too strong a word. Miscarriage of justice is perhaps more appropriate, and specifically that of Apollo Justice, the cover star of this latest trilogy in Capcom's beloved lawyer 'em up. Except poor old Apollo isn't really what holds this collection of Ace Attorneys 4, 5 and 6 together at all. Sure, he features in all of them, but at the end of the day, it's still the series' original bluffer supreme Phoenix Wright who heads up most of the casework here, relegating his new protegee back to bench-warming duties almost as soon as Apollo's debut game rolls its credits. What's more, he quickly has to share that space with Athena Cykes, another new hotshot lawyer that enters the firm in Dual Destinies and continues the scrappy defence trifecta in Spirit Of Justice.\nThe result is a set of games that feel considerably wobblier than Capcom's first and more robust Ace Attorney trilogy, and quite a bit more unfocused than the more recent Victorian-era spin-off, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles. But despite a slightly unsure start, there are still plenty of career highs to be found here for Wright, Cykes and Justice, and Spirit Of Justice in particular remains one of the series' best entries to date. Those new to Ace Attorney should absolutely begin their journey elsewhere, but for series completionists, the Apollo Justice Trilogy is quite the welcome development.\nRead more",

          "description": "When I innocently went on holiday on Thursday evening, Palworld was that flagrant cash-in survival game where you can make Pokemon - sorry, Pals - shoot guns and work on an assembly line. As of this morning, it's among the most-played games in the world, one of just six to exceed one million concurrent players on Steam. Right now, it's doing almost twice the numbers of Steam's usual chart-topper Counter-Strike 2. We have entered the Pal Age, it seems - but how long will the feeding frenzy last? How much is owing to it releasing during the quiet time of year with a meme-ish premise, while capitalising on pent-up demand for a proper PC version of Nintendo's monster-catching series? Much will depend, I think, on how quickly developers Pocketpair can update it and stay ahead of the usual early access game avalanche of community requests and complaints.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "For a game that's been repeatedly described as \"Pokémon with machineguns\", the first thing that strikes me about Palworld is just how un-Pokémon-like it actually is. To its credit, it does do quite a good Pokémon Legends: Arceus impression when you first step out on its big, Breath Of The Wild-style hilltop and take in the open world vista of its monster-stuffed starting continent. But if the opening moments of washing up on the island in nothing but your very scantily clad undies hadn't already given it away (seriously, why do shipwrecks always destroy the clothes you had on, but not your smalls underneath?), then the ream of tutorial prompts about punching trees to get more wood, building bases, putting pals to work on said bases, and the endless parade of crafting technologies you'll need to unlock to actually do anything on this godforsaken rock will quickly pull the wool clear away from your hopeful little face. \nFor underneath the cute round eyes of its cover stars, Palworld is really a survival game wearing the dead skin suits of Game Freak's catch 'em all monster friends. In a lot of cases, those skin suits are quite literal, such are the blatant palette swaps and so-close-to-copyright-infringement-I-can't-believe-Nintendo's-lawyers-haven't-shut-this-down-years-ago rip-off creatures on display here. For that reason alone, Palworld can feel about as soulless and cynical as it comes. But that's not the worst of it. Even aside from all the survival gubbins, base building and sweatshop automation practices shoved down your throat, Palworld is just an awful example of monster-catching games in general. If it's a Pokémon game on PC you're after, go and play Cassette Beasts. Go and play Coromon, TemTem, or Monster Sanctuary. Anything but this. \nRead more",

The first to come out (albeit only on Netflix at the moment) was the turn-based strategy game Highwater (also a bit of a dud, based on the early Steam demo I played last year), but it's the second game, The Cub (out today on Steam) that has prompted this current moment of teeth-sucking sadness. \nI've been playing a bit of it over the last week, and oh man, it's trying so, so hard to be like Limbo and Inside, but just... doing quite a terrible job of it all.

An earlier version of this review would have been a very negative on, filled mostly with complaints and annoyances about opaque and frustrating systems, most of which I've since got over as the intent behind its design has become more clear.\nIt could definitely explain some things better, and its inscrutably tiny graphics remain a minor nuisance. But it's grown on me a lot, and though it may not be quite the kind of turn-based RPG I get on with best, it's an enjoyable one with a refreshing lack of bloat and timewasting, and with a class and combat system that will be pure catnip to a particular kind of player.\nRead more",

Not that any of them could decide how to actually pronounce WASD when it came to talking about them on last night's Developer Update stream, though, as there were competing cries of \"was-dee\", \"wased\" and \"double-you-ey-es-dee\" all over the shop as they debated this clearly very \"controversial topic\" live on air.

          "description": "Back in the depths of 2023's February Steam Next Fest, Roots Of Yggdrasil was one of a handful of games that really caught my attention. Not because it was another beautiful-looking deckbuilder (though that does seem to be a steadily growing niche of mine these days), or because its colourful, inkwash visuals had the air of a Norse-flavoured Okami about them (though it did also help). Rather, it was the way its roguelike foundations meshed with its freeform, but still very goal-driven turn-based building systems, giving you drive and purpose in your construction choices, while also being light and chill, with just the right amount of existential threat nipping at your heels.\nIt struck me that if, say, my best puzzle strategy bud Dorfromantik was ever turned into a roguelike, this is probably a good approximation of what it would look and feel like, which is, frankly, yep, I'd like that game right now, please. Happily, with Roots Of Yggdrasil now approaching its early access launch on January 24th, I'm very happy to report that it's come on leaps and bounds since that Next Fest demo. This is already a very moreish and polished building game, and I've been struggling to tear myself away from it as I guide my longboat of magic Vikings away from their impending Ragnarok.\nRead more",

          "description": "Four months after the troubled launch of Payday 3, developers Starbreeze have announced they've formed a \"strike team of veteran developers\" with the goal of bringing it \"up to where it will meet your expectations\". The cooperative heist FPS got off to a right bumpy start when the ever-unpopular decision to only be playable if you're online collided with server issues that saw Starbreeze take the game down for a while. Since then, it has failed to rise above 'Mixed' review rating on Steam, not helped by Starbreeze releasing a £15 DLC pack when many players were unhappy with the game they'd just bought for £35.\nRead more",

Still, there are plenty of new buildings to help you harness the power of the stanky water and errr, exercise halls for beavers to get their sweat on.

And also he tears up any paperwork handed to him. Turnip Boy Robs A Bank follows directly on from his Tax Evasion, and it's not quite as funny or as focused, but it's also an entirely different genre of game, and I have a huge amount respect for that.\nRead more",

I keep turning this fact over in my head as I watch Lazy Bear Games' associate producer Vlada Redko play a portion of Bandle Tale over Discord for me, with creative director Nikita Kulaga and Riot Forge's creative director Rowan Parker telling me about what's happening onscreen in front of me. As Redko explores the whimsical, knitting-themed city of Bandle as one of League Of Legends' tiny fluffy Yordle creatures, it is, to put it lightly, quite the tonal shift from their previous work. But don't let its cute looks fool you.\nThis is a crafting RPG with a ferociously long set of skill trees to master, with 40-60 hours' worth of new abilities to learn, objects to construct, errands to run, friends to enlist and - crucially - parties to throw. For in the Bandle woods of Runeterra, life's problems are solved by having a good old fashioned boogie, including the rather urgent issue of fixing the world's portal network, which has collapsed in a mysterious accident. It may have a softer, fluffier-looking surface than Graveyard Keeper, but underneath it looks as though there's just as much to dig into here, so here's what I've learned so far ahead of its release on February 21st.\nRead more",

In an email provided to Kotaku, it was announced that over 30 people will be affected. This information was confirmed with the publication. As other companies have promised during their layoffs, PCF claims that it will aid its ex-employees during the transition. \n\n\n\nIn the email, developer director Adam Alker states that the layoffs are due to a shrinking budget and smaller scope on an unannounced game codenamed Project Gemini which is set to be published by Square Enix. 20 people will be taken off the project but will still get to work for the company. \n\n\n\n\nThe layoffs come after the PCF-published Bulletstorm VR which has attracted notoriety due to its catastrophic launch. People Can Fly has released a joint statement with developers promising to fix the issues players have complained about. \n\n\nThis is far from the first case of layoffs in 2024. Riot has been the most notable thus far, with over 500 employees affected. \n\n\nThe post Outriders developer People Can Fly confirms layoffs appeared first on Destructoid.",

The latest side-scrolling action game from Inti Creates (Azure Striker Gunvolt, Blaster Master Zero) is set to launch on consoles and PC on May 30, 2024.\n\n\nSpecifically, Umbraclaw is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC. A demo is on the way to the February 2024 edition of Steam Next Fest, and you can see how much ass this little cat kicks in the release date trailer below. \n\n\n\n\nUmbraclaw follows a house cat named Kuon, who awakens in the Soulplane after dying in our world. In order to return home, she'll have to brave this realm of the dead, which has a really cool art style to it. While cats do have nine lives, those lives come and go rather easily. Whenever Kuon takes a hit she dies; simple as that. Thankfully, she has an \"Anima Revive\" power that can bring her back to life with a new skill each time, paving the way for different play styles and leading her toward multiple possible endings. \n\n\nSome of those skills are animal transformation skills like the Crow, Tyrannosaurus, and Elephant (take that, Mario). Kuon can also change into a humanoid form for \"full fighting action,\" switching the focus from enemy avoidance to direct combat. Blaster Master Zero director Satoru Nishizawa is at the helm for this one, and hopefully, it's as fun to play as it is to watch. We'll see how the sampler pans out next month ahead of the May launch. We'll also find out more about the other mystery game Inti Creates is working on During PAX East 2024!\n\nThe post Inti Creates’ Umbraclaw proves cats have nine lives AND rad powers, launches this May appeared first on Destructoid.",

Years ago, the classic RPG taught many of us how remarkably satisfying it feels when all of your loot clicks together just right. Enter Backpack Hero: a game that takes this very system and runs —nay, sprints with it.\n\n\n\nTo be clear, Backpack Hero isn’t the first attempt to make a game out of loot packing. The Save Room games, for example, turn Resident Evil 4’s inventory system into a standalone puzzler. What, Backpack Hero does, instead, is interpret this concept as a full-fledged, deckbuilding roguelite.

          "description": "Every so often, a game comes along with an amazing elevator pitch but as soon as you jump into it, it becomes obvious why it's a bad idea. \n\n\nWe're all capable of well-meaning bad ideas, and Rotten Flesh is one of them. It features a concept that blends genuinely terrifying cosmic horror with a gimmick that should have never made it this far. You find yourself in a strange underground sewer (at least for as long as I played) and complete typical Resident Evil-style environmental puzzles (it's even got a typewriter to save!). Your objective? To find your dog, named Roy.\n\n\nTo locate the right direction to travel in (even with a lantern it's quite dark) you need to call out for Roy who'll bark back in response. As an experiment for how terrible of a gameplay mechanic this is, try yelling out Roy five times right now: I'll wait! I'd do it too but I live in an apartment, and as a society, we have rules.\n\n\n\n\nRaising your voice like this to your dog is annoying in real life and it gets no better when you're dealing with a microphone on a controller or the Steam Deck or your laptop that's actually hooked up to a monitor and sits under your desk. \n\n\nYou can avoid some of these problems by pressing a button for your main character to do the yelling for you, but that takes away a key component of the game's identity. The aim was to make a sound-inspired game. On that front, we have an amazingly unpleasant title. \n\n\nIt's also worth mentioning how tiring it is to keep yelling for Roy when you're lost. I'd rather use any of my other main means of communication, even eye-tracking as the game Before Your Eyes does beautifully, than yell at my game. \n\n\nThere'll be some who enjoy this title and its uniqueness. I generally like idiosyncratic titles. Give me an FMV or unique indie any day. But not Rotten Flesh. He's not a good boy. \n\nThe post Rotten Flesh, a new unique horror game, is sadly too annoying to finish appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Say what you will about the likes of Resident Evil 4, its iconic B-movie cheese means it's a game that doesn't take itself too seriously. However, there's being flippant about certain aspects of your IP and...whatever's going on with this mod.\n\n\nIf you want to see the kinds of things people do to mess about with their favorite games, look no further than Nexus Mods user SupremeLeader777. For some reason, they've decided to take Ada Wong from Resident Evil 4's \"Separate Ways\" DLC and swap out her character model for that of a harbor seal.\n\n\nImage via SupremeLeader777/Nexus Mods.\n\n\nIf there's any rationale behind it, they're not saying so on the download page. The images suggest it's exactly as you would imagine: RE4 Remake with a seal instead of Ada running (flapping?) around the place.\n\n\nYou can almost hear the slapping sounds\n\n\nAs far as I can tell, it's still the same DLC content – still the same game – just you play as a slippery, Arctic mammal instead of the infamous mercenary. If you go through SupremeLeader777's other mods, you'll see this is not the first instance of swapping the vanilla character out for someone (or something) else. It's the appeal of modding, I guess.\n\n\nA couple of days ago, I wrote about how someone has made it possible to play RE4 in first-person without needing a headset. One might argue this is quite a nifty download for anyone who hasn't got – and/or can't afford – VR.\n\n\nThat's not to say anything negative about the Ada Wong/seal mod. Seeing the silly things people in the community do is one of the reasons I love talking about modding. But now all I can think about is whether the harbor seal speaks in Wong's voice, or the audio has been replaced by \"arfs\" instead.\n\nThe post Um…this Resident Evil 4 mod has a harbor seal instead of Ada Wong appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Excitement for Obsidian Entertainment's upcoming action-RPG Avowed has no doubt ramped up since it was shown off at Developer Direct. Since then, some extended footage has been doing the rounds, with an in-depth discussion about the game from its two directors.\n\n\nIn the recent video from the official Xbox podcast, Game Director Carrie Patel and Gameplay Director Gabe Paramo take us through some moments from Avowed's Shatterskarp area. We get a pretty tasty morsel of what's to come from Obsidian's next release (though it needs to be said that all footage is from the alpha build currently).\n\n\n\n\nThe action looks pretty sweet and while the game is not intending to be Skyrim adjacent, I can't help but see a little bit of TES5 in all that sword swinging and shield bashing. I'm here for it, essentially.\n\n\nDoing what Obsidian does best\n\n\nWhile all this high-octane, fantasy action is a key part of the gameplay, there will be plenty of people who'll be interested in how well the story will be written (yo). Obsidian is known for crafting rich worlds with great dialogue options, something which Avowed will likely feature.\n\n\nRemember, this is the same studio that brought us the narrative-rich Pentiment (a game I absolutely fell in love with when I played it). Oh, also something called Fallout: New Vegas. Maybe you've heard of it.\n\n\nIt seems Obsidian Entertainment can't do much wrong at the minute. Whatever genre it dips its toes into, the studio often come up with something that has an equal mix of great gameplay and fantastic writing. Win-win.\n\n\nOn top of that, Avowed will be coming to Xbox Game Pass on launch day. We don't know when it's releasing exactly, but it's expected later this year.\n\nThe post Avowed extended footage shows off sweet, Elder Scrolls-esque combat appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Splatoon 3 fans woke up to big news this morning. After initially being slated for Spring 2024, the second wave of the game's DLC is getting a bump up. It's now scheduled to be released toward the end of next month. \n\n\nSplatoon 3 Sider Order is now confirmed to be heading our way on February 22. It's included as part of the Splatoon 3 Expansion Pass. The pass consists of the already released Inkopolis DLC and the upcoming Sider Order content. The Expansion Pass is currently listed at $24.99.\n\n\n\n\nToday's Side Order release date trailer looks like it purposely evokes a Matrix vibe. We see Agent 8 fall asleep on a train just as the screen starts to glitch. It then quickly becomes overwhelmed by falling symbols that's quite similar to the Matrix series' green coding. We'll have to wait and see whether the sci-fi series is alluded to any further in the upcoming DLC.\n\n\nInkopolis reintroduced the first Splatoon game's main hub as an explorable area. There were some minor changes to the environment, but nothing radical. Side Order looks to be a much meatier piece of new content.\n\n\nSide Order introduces a new location in the Spire of Order. In this single-player campaign, players will experience a challenge tower of sorts. You'll attempt to advance through the Spire of Order's various floors by taking on wave after wave of oncoming enemies. Nintendo says the new content is meant to be played over and over.\n\n\nMore single-player content for the \"superb\" Splatoon 3 is certainly something to be excited about. We'll see how it all comes together on February 22.\n\nThe post Splatoon 3 Side Order DLC arrives near the end of  February appeared first on Destructoid.",

The full pre-recorded performance will be available to stream for free via Nintendo's YouTube channel on February 9. \n\n\n\n\nAccording to the official website, viewers who tune into the concert can look forward to music selections ranging from the first Zelda to Tears of the Kingdom, all performed by a full orchestra. The video is listed as being around 30 minutes in length, and you'll be able to catch it starting at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time right here.\n\n\nThis particular concert was originally scheduled to be performed at the Nintendo Live 2024 TOKYO event, which was canceled due to unspecified threats. The event was planned for January 20 and 21 at Tokyo Big Sight before \"aggressive\" threats were made toward Nintendo staff and attendees. This also resulted in the postponement of national and world championships for Splatoon 3 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Beyond the concerts, the Nintendo Live 2024 TOKYO event was also going to serve as a showcase for the latest games from Nintendo.  \n\n\nThe Legend of Zelda Orchestra Concert isn't the only event that just announced its rescheduled plans.

          "description": "Time marches forward, and with it, gaming must also keep itself relevant. A few months back, we talked about how Nintendo was ending online support for two of its now-defunct consoles. A recent update from the company has since narrowed down exactly when that's going to be happening.\n\n\nAs of April 8 – at exactly 4 p.m. PDT – most online services for the 3DS and Wii U will be shut down for good. That's according to a recent Twitter post, which leads to a customer support page that goes into more detail.\n\n\n\n\nThe information says the discontinuation will be for the following: New Nintendo 3DS, New 3DS XL, New 2DS XL, 3DS, 3DS XL, 2DS, Wii U Deluxe, and Wii U Basic. This will affect \"online co-operative play, internet rankings, and data distribution.\" A second tweet says it's possible to \"merge your unused Nintendo eShop balance to your Nintendo Account\" for use on the Switch. Details about that can be found here.\n\n\nA number of caveats\n\n\nWhile the servers themselves are being turned off, Nintendo does say that players \"will still be able to use features and game modes that do not require online communication.\" It also won't be ending the StreetPass feature for now, as that uses local communication and doesn't require online connectivity.\n\n\nFor the time being, you will still be able to update and redownload purchased games, and the service shutdown won't have an immediate impact on Pokémon Bank and Poké Transporter. People should still be able to download update data and redownload purchased software and DLC from the eShop. Again, that can all change in the future.\n\n\nI was honestly surprised online was still supported for the Wii U and 3DS. The latter was discontinued in 2020, while the former's lifecycle was ended back in 2017, almost seven years ago. Shows how much I have my finger on the pulse of outdated Nintendo consoles.\n\nThe post Nintendo to end online play services for 3DS and Wii U on April 8 appeared first on Destructoid.",

It was initially released in November 2023 on PC and Switch.\n\n\nHowl is one that escaped me. When I think back to November, it’s mostly a blur to me, so that’s no surprise. However, it looks interesting from screenshots and the title of the press release reads “critically acclaimed.” That phrase gets stretched pretty far in the PR world, but, sure enough, Opencritic shows a warm reception from the publications that covered it.\n\n\n\n\nThe announcement also describes Howl as folklore turn-based strategy. A strange howling turns anyone who hears it into werewolves. You play as a deaf heroine who is searching to cure it. From the trailer, it looks to be more of a puzzle game than a turn-based strategy title. You plan your moves in six steps, changing positions on the tiled field and completing actions to try and evade or take down enemies. If you’ll forgive the somewhat obscure reference, it reminds me of Trogdor the Board Game.\n\n\nThere are 60 stages through 4 chapters, and you unlock new abilities and upgrades as you progress through the world map. Most striking, however, is the art style, which looks like it’s hand-drawn in a simple storybook style. \n\n\nI’m bringing this up not just to warn PlayStation and Xbox players that it’s now available to their chosen platform but also for anyone else who, like me, might have missed it at first.\n\n\nHowl is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and PC.\n\nThe post Storybook strategy game Howl has been released on PS5 and Xbox appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Death Stranding Director's Cut is being listed on the App Store for $39.99. However, those who preorder ahead of the January 30 launch can enjoy a nice 50% discount on their purchase.

Sam Barlow and Half Mermaid have stealthily launched Steam pages for Project C and Project D.\n\n\nBoth projects contain heavy redactions in their page descriptions and info, much like how Immortality was called \"Project Ambrosio.\" Barlow responded to the teasers getting spotted by accounts like Wario64, though we don't have much more to go on now besides the pages themselves.\n\n\n\n\nProject C is the new cinematic... something from Barlow and Half Mermaid, his studio that's produced both Telling Lies and Immortality. (Barlow's previous Her Story lists him as the sole developer and publisher.) You will appear to do something for the first time ever in a video game, for what that's worth.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Project D is a survival horror game from the Half Mermaid crew. Keywords include \"nurse,\" \"1983,\" \"nightmare,\" and \"be careful.\" Seems like something worth paying attention to for Silent Hill fans, at the least.\n\n\nLife preserved in the pictures\n\n\nAlongside this news, Barlow and co. also confirmed a partnership with Lost in Cult for a new Design Works book about the making of Immortality. All that, plus Immortality hitting PlayStation today, makes for a big news day for the Half Mermaid team.\n\n\nIt's interesting to see the Half Mermaid crew tackle two projects, and tease them out at the same time. Immortality was an absolutely captivating game that easily stole a spot in my end-of-year favorites, so I'm keen to see what's next for them. Both a cinematic work and a survival horror effort makes me curious, though. We really only have a few screenshots and scattered text to go on, though. It's good fodder for all the House of Leaves fans, I guess.\n\n\nWe'll learn more about Project C and D soon, hopefully.

The film's return to theaters is the result of a collaboration between Square Enix, Fathom Events, and Sony Pictures.

Those who want to see Cloud's Buster Sword in the largest format possible can check out the English-dubbed version on February 21, followed by the subtitled version on February 22. The director's cut is a whopping 26 minutes longer than the theatrical release, packing in various visual improvements and around a thousand updated scenes. The story finds a mysterious new illness spreading quickly throughout the world, bringing old enemies back out of the woodwork and forcing Cloud to pick up his impossibly heavy blade and get back into action. \n\n\nIf you do decide to head to the theater for this one next month, Square Enix wants you to prepare for a history lesson before the lights dim. Folks who show up early will be treated to exclusive introductory content like the history of Final Fantasy VII, how it connects to Advent Children, interviews with Tetsuya Nomura and Rebirth director Naoki Hamaguchi, and more. \n\nThe post Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children heads back to US theaters ahead of Rebirth appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Following some delays, Freedom Planet 2 finally made its PC debut in September 2022, and now it has its sights set on consoles. Publisher XSEED Games announced plans to bring developer GalaxyTrail's sequel to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on April 4, 2024.\n\n\nIn addition to showing off the four heroines of Freedom Planet 2 and their high-speed exploits, the release date trailer previews a brand new mode. When Freedom Planet 2 hits consoles it will come with the oft-requested Boss Rush mode across all platforms, including a simultaneous update on PC. Split into two divisions with 17 boss challenges in each one, Boss Rush mode will be accessible via the in-game Battlesphere when it goes live. Beating the bosses in both divisions will unlock an in-game VIP room full of easter eggs that long-time fans should appreciate.\n\n\n\n\nXSEED has digital releases set for all platforms, with the Switch eShop release offering 10% off pre-orders from now until a week after launch. The PlayStation release will include a bundle of both the PS4 and PS5 versions, and those who opt to check it out on Xbox will be able to take advantage of Smart Delivery to access the optimal version of the game on both platforms. \n\n\nI haven't played the sequel yet, but the first Freedom Planet was pretty much the ideal Sonic game I never knew I needed, so I'm psyched for this one to hit consoles. It all makes sense considering the series' origins as a Sonic the Hedgehog fangame by GalaxyTrail founder Sabrina DiDuro. If you can't wait until the console release, you can nab the sequel for the same price of $24.99 on Steam right now. \n\nThe post Freedom Planet 2 zips to consoles on April 4, adds Boss Rush mode appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "We're getting closer to Princess Peach's next act on the main stage. Princess Peach: Showtime! is coming to the Nintendo Switch in March, and Nintendo dropped a new trailer today teasing what's on the way.\n\n\nThe leader of the Mushroom Kingdom leaves the crown behind and takes on a series of new roles in the upcoming title. Many of which you can catch in the new Princess Peach: Showtime! trailer below. \n\n\n\n\nSo far, we've seen Peach sport several different hats, including a cowgirl getup, detective 'fit, swordfighter ensemble, and even a patissiere costume complete with Yoshi's Cookie-inspired designs. \n\n\nThe gist of Princess Peach: Showtime! revolves around Peach and a few of her closest toads putting on a show at the famed Sparkle Theater of the Mushroom Kingdom. However, shockingly to everyone, some bad guys arrive to heckle the performers and put an end to the show. \n\n\nGameplay-wise, Peach will tackle a bunch of different roles as she travels from stage to stage in an effort to take down the nefarious Grape and the Sour Bunch. Yes, that is their real name.\n\n\nTo squash Grape and his crew, the Mushroom Kingdom Princess will take on numerous roles, including Swordfighter Peach, Patissiere Peach, Cowgirl Peach, Ninja Peach, Detective Peach, Kung Fu Peach, and likely several more that we haven't seen yet. \n\n\nPrincess Peach: Showtime! gives us the Princess' first solo outing since 2005's Super Princess Peach on the Nintendo DS. It's one of the better non-Mario Mario games out there. The character is long overdue for a new outing of her own, especially after the character's strong depiction in The Super Mario Bros. Movie.\n\n\nPeach will look to make Grape whine and go home when Princess Peach: Showtime! raises the curtains on March 22. \n\nThe post New Princess Peach: Showtime! trailer shows Peach in a variety of roles appeared first on Destructoid.",

To get you ready for the game, Ironwood Studios has released a video that covers the core gameplay.\n\n\nIt isn’t hard to understand the basics of Pacific Drive, but there are a lot of deeper systems to keep in mind. For example, gathering anchor energy is important, but you might not realize how important it really is until you’re caught in an area with reality collapsing around you. So, you can learn from your mistakes like I did, or you can watch this video.\n\n\n\n\nHaving played Pacific Drive, I can tell you that this 10-minute video is pretty all-encompassing, covering car maintenance, survival, scavenging, and upgrading. If you’re not sure what the game is going to play like, this will tell you what it is and what it isn’t. Also, look at it this way, it will allow you to glide through the tutorial parts pretty easily.\n\n\nI previewed Pacific Drive a while back, and while I have some reservations, my time with it left me excited to get my hands on the full experience. There’s a lot of elements of what I love mixed in there, and I’m wondering how well they’ll fare when stretched out to a full experience. I’m worried that the core gameplay loop will become repetitive, so I’m hoping to see a lot of surprises scattered about as you proceed further into the zone.\n\n\nPacific Drive is out on February 22, 2024 for PS4 and PC.\n\nThe post This Pacific Drive ‘Surviving the Zone’ video gives a deep 10 minute primer appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you've been itching to see retro games be given a bit of a pep in this modern gaming world, Nvidia's RTX modding toolkit is already realizing that dream. With the open beta now out, prepare yourselves for an upscaled return of some classics.\n\n\nIn a rather lengthy post, Nvidia has outlined exactly what the RTX Remix software is capable of. In a nutshell: it's a \"cutting-edge modding platform\" that allows for games from a bygone era to be given a bit of a remaster.\n\n\n\n\nThe above video shows what it can do. In this instance, we can see ray-tracing versions of Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind and Half-Life 2, complete with higher definition assets. We're already seeing it in the likes of Tomb Raider and Vice City, so expect a lot more to come out of the woodwork now Remix is out in beta.\n\n\nAlso comes with DLSS 3.5 and Ray Reconstruction\n\n\nI suppose one of the questions modders may have is: will RTX Remix be compatible with any game? While it's designed to work with a lot of different titles, Nvidia says its \"level of compatibility may vary depending on the complexity of the game’s assets and engine.\"\n\n\nWe know it works on older games because we've already seen it in action. The software \"works best with DirectX 8 and 9 games with fixed function pipelines.\" Things like Hitman 2, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines, and Call of Duty 2 should work, as well as the aforementioned ones.\n\n\nWhether you're sick of remasters, remakes, reboots, and other \"re-\" words or not, RTX Remix is probably going to see a boon in unofficial remasters of video games from yesterday that have been given a shiny new coat.\n\nThe post Nvidia RTX Remix beta now out, expect shiny remasters of classic games appeared first on Destructoid.",

With that in-mind, it seems the studio is now looking to make some headway on the new Witcher saga.\n\n\nThat's according to a recent report from Reuters. The developer's joint CEO, Adam Badowski, tells the publication that the team is aiming to start the \"production phase\" on the first entry in the next set of Witcher games, currently codenamed Polaris.\n\n\n\n\nBadowski goes on to say that the company would like to \"have around 400 people working on the project by the middle of the year.\" CDPR is also at the \"conceptual phase\" regarding the follow-up to Cyberpunk 2077, with around 80 people expected to be working on that game by the end of 2024. CD Projekt Red has also apparently considered multiplayer elements for the new Cyberpunk, but isn't discussing details right now.\n\n\nWin some, lose some\n\n\nOn top of this, a recent post on Twitter announced that Phantom Liberty has been nominated for \"Outstanding Visual Effects in a Real-Time Project\" at the 22nd Annual Visual Effects Society Award.\n\n\nThe Cyberpunk DLC was not only the culmination of a lot of work fixing the glaring issues that plagued the game, but it was also something of a swansong for the dystopian RPG. CD Projekt Red may well take what harsh lessons it's learned and apply them to the sequel.\n\n\nHowever, the Reuters report goes on to say that the studio may be looking into artificial intelligence for some of its future releases.

Maybe it's a bit cliché to say it's taking the industry by storm, but the data shows just how massive it's been in such a short span of time.\n\n\nWe've already spoken about how the game has been smashing Steam records, but the numbers just keep going up and up. At the time of writing, not only has Palworld surpassed 1.8 million players within the last few minutes, but it's also become the second-most-played Steam game ever, according to stats from SteamDB. This puts it ahead of Valve's own Counter-Strike 2.\n\n\n\n\nOn top of that, a recent tweet from the developer says the game has now sold more than six million copies. That's in the space of four days, remember?\n\n\nLet me catch my breath, please!\n\n\nI seriously can't keep up with the figures. Between pitching this story and writing these very words, Palworld seems to keep breaking expectations. By the time this article gets published, I'm anticipating news about how it's elevated itself above human comprehension and has taken over the very cosmos.\n\n\nBut how long can something like this last? It's not even been a week, but the number of people playing has exceeded what anyone could have predicted. It's knocked the Steam Deck off its number one spot, which is something that even the most hyped-up games struggle to do.\n\n\nAnd the best part is, it is still in Early Access. It's pretty bug-ridden (it's straight up crashed my Xbox twice already, to the point where I thought it had bricked the console at one point), but there's something about a \"Pokémon-with-guns\" game that's got everyone talking. Surely the bubble will burst soon, yeah?\n\nThe post Palworld just keeps hitting milestone after milestone appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Nier Reincarnation, the story-driven mobile RPG set in the popular Nier universe, will have its services ended this April. While the game will continue to receive support until then, its final story campaign will serve as its last big hurrah. \nReincarnation first launched on July 28, 2021 for iOS and Android and takes place within an unspecified point in the Nier timeline. Like the previous titles, Reincarnation is an RPG set within a mysterious prison world called The Cage, with players controlling different protagonists divided across multiple story arcs. The game has also hosted several crossover events with games such as the remake of Nier Replicant, Final Fantasy XIV, and Persona 5.\nThe shutdown news came the same day as the launch of the latest chapter of its final story arc, The People And The World, dubbed Act II: The Return. Check out the trailer below.\n\n\nIn a shutdown notice, Square Enix states, \nUntil service concludes, Square Enix will offer 10 free summons per day, weekly gem gifts, and other perks. Sales of items on the Premium Shop have ceased. You can read the full rollout of final updates and events in Square Enix's blog post. \nFormer editor Jason Guisao was impressed with Nier Reincarnation, hailing it in an opinion piece as one of the strongest mobile titles available, writing that \"Lengthy narratives and skill-based gameplay loops have come in console/PC-ports like Genshin Impact and PUBG Mobile. Nier Reincarnation, however, employs a happy medium. Heartfelt plotlines with striking visuals, Keiichi Okabe’s mesmerizing score, unintrusive microtransactions, and simple, but rewarding, combat controls establish Reincarnation as one of the best console-like games on mobile devices.\"",

Now, just a few months later, Nintendo has revealed exactly when: February 22, 2024. That's when Wave 2 of the Splatoon 3 expansion pass, which features Side Order as the star of the show, goes live, and it's when players can explore the Spire of Order, a brand new location. \nNintendo announced this news with a short teaser trailer today that shows Agent 8 sleeping on a train. The teaser then transitions to the Spire of Order where a mysterious voice is calling out to Agent 8. \nCheck it out for yourself below in the Splatoon 3 Side Order DLC release date trailer: \n\n\nFor the uninitiated, Agent 8 is the protagonist from Splatoon 2's Octo Expansion. In Side Order, Agent 8 will meet a new character named Acht, who claims to go \"way back\" with Marina, one of the hosts of Splatoon 2. Marina's co-host, Pearl, seems to make an appearance of sorts in Side Order as a robot that accompanies Agent 8 on their journey. \nWith the Spire of Order devoid of color, Acht gives Agent 8 color chips to modify their abilities, like boosting run speed and increasing damage. It's likely Agent 8's colored ink will be used to bring color back to the spire, too, but we'll have to wait until February 22 to find out. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's Splatoon 3 review, and then check out what else is in the Splatoon 3 expansion pass. \nAre you going to check out Side Order next month?

While that reveal included details about the survival aspects of the game, including multiplayer, crafting, and farming, viewers honed in on the idea of it being Pokémon but with guns. You can capture Pokémon-like monsters called Pals in special balls (and you can capture humans, too), but it's smart to shoot them or hack at them with an axe first to lower their health. And then, once under your command, you can give them their own guns to use, of course. \nFollowing various trailers since that 2021 reveal, including this gameplay showcase and this one highlighting the different Pals you can find, we learned at Geoff Keighely's Summer Game Fest last year that Palworld would finally…",

Square Enix also revealed Visions of Mana will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC this summer.\nExecutive producer Masaru Oyamada discussed the franchise's history, noting there have been 17 entries across its 30 years of existence. He also points out that what is now the Mana series today actually began as Final Fantasy Adventure in 1991. \n\n\nMana series creator Koichi Ishii also joined this segment of the show to discuss how he has supervised the team on its work and implementation of taking what were originally pixelated monsters and converting them into the 3D monsters players will fight in the game. \nNotably, Visions of Mana is the first Mana game coming to Xbox. Oyamada expressed Square Enix's excitement about this first for the series while diving deeper into its real-time action combat. This real-time action combat is what originally separated Final Fantasy Adventure from the Final Fantasy series, which was strictly turn-based at the time. \nVisions of Mana's combat continues to look great, as does its beautifully vibrant world. Unfortunately, there's still a few months to go until PlayStation, Xbox, and PC players can play it because it's due out sometime this summer. \n\nWhile waiting for its release, check out the Visions of Mana announcement trailer from The Game Awards 2023 last month. \nAre you excited for Visions of Mana?

          "description": "Developer Ninja Theory appeared on Microsoft's Xbox Developer Direct stream to discuss its sequel, Senua's Saga: Hellblade II. The big news from the footage is the game finally has a release date: May 21. Microsoft also confirmed that the game will be a digital-only release.\nThe developer revealed it is in the final months of development and outlined some elements to expect from Hellblade II. Senua is not in as much fear of her voices as she was in the original game, but she is still a Celtic warrior who struggles with psychosis. Like the first game, Ninja Theory is working with professionals like Cambridge's Paul Fletcher to ensure Senua represents an accurate version of someone struggling with complex mental issues.\n\n\nThere are a number of new characters she will interact with. Some will appreciate her perspective and consider her an ally, but others will reject her and consider her an enemy. Like the original game, Hellblade II takes 10th century Iceland (which the developer visited for research), and she is fighting against Vikings who are enslaving her people. Ninja Theory is focused on making the game historically accurate but with an obvious layer of fantasy on top.\nCombat has been overhauled for the sequel, with the game focusing on the fact that Senua is not a superhero. The goal of the combat is to make players feel like they barely survived each encounter, and the gameplay footage of the combat looks brutal.\nNinja Theory ended the stream saying it hopes to \"craft life-changing art with game-changing tech.\" We will determine if the game lives up to that lofty goal on May 21.",

But in 2023 alone, more than 10,000 developers and people in games-adjacent industries were laid off. Plus, the unchecked rise of A.I. continued, and Unity burned developers with its controversial new game engine policies, not to name a few other not-so-great parts about 2023 – it was a great year for games but one of the worst for those who make them. \nNow, just as 2024 has begun, the Game Developers Conference has released its 12th annual State of the Game Industry report.

The game is a thrilling adventure, with plenty of excellent combat, puzzle, and traversal challenges. Once you get far enough in the game, you’ll likely encounter one of the most challenging of them all; The Impossible Climb is a late-game platforming/traversal sidequest that demands careful timing, patience, and the use of nearly all the powers you’ve earned up to that point in the story.

Citizens are born, they die, rulers change, and can be betrayed.” Players control their own castle over multiple generations of rulers, families, and subjects. Decision-making dictates how well your kingdom operates and how content your subjects are; unhappy citizens may plot to overthrow you. \nYour castle can be expanded with new rooms and items, plus workstations for underlings. It appears to feature a turn-based combat system with players equipping heroes with gear to battle enemies and gather resources to grow their kingdom. Though the game's App Store page states that it includes in-game purchases, it is unclear if Castles is free-to-play or not. \nThe Elder Scrolls: Castles has soft-launched in the Philippines and will become available in other regions over the next few months. It is the third mobile game in the series, following The Elder Scrolls: Blades, a traditional RPG, in 2019 and The Elder Scrolls: Legends, a collectible card game, in 2017.",

Mintrocket did confirm to us that Wakerunners is being developed by a different internal team (apparently it has a number of projects from distinct teams going at once), but the pedigree is still worth calling out.\nAs for the game itself, you can check out the game's teaser trailer below.\n\n\nTechnically, the game was soft-revealed in 2022 as Project TB and is a 4v4 and 5vr top-down competitive action game. The game follows a collection of factions trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic earth. The combat leans on a fast-paced system where players glide across the arena using acceleration and deceleration to their advantage as they engage in close-quarters combat. You will apparently be able to swap characters mid-battle, which will obviously affect strategies.\n\nA demo will be available for the game during the next Steam Next Fest, which will include five different modes and seven playable characters.

          "description": "Grand Theft Auto V developer Rockstar Games and Alan Wake 2 studio Remedy Entertainment have a history that goes back years, namely due to the two's work on the Max Payne series. However, the companies are at the center of two trademark disputes filed by Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, as first reported by RespawnFirst. In the disputes, Take-Two takes issue with Remedy's new logo it unveiled in April of last year, which features a stylized \"R,\" claiming it's too similar to Rockstar's own \"R\" logo. \nThe trademark disputes – here and here – were filed in the United Kingdom, and Take-Two, based in New York, is named as the \"opponent\" in it. The disputes were filed on May 11, 2023, which is a month after Remedy unveiled its new logo. \nNotably, despite the trademark dispute, Rockstar and Remedy are working together on a remake package of Max Payne 1 and 2. In October of last year, Remedy said the Max Payne 1 & 2 remake, which is a single game, has \"progressed into a production readiness stage.\"\nWhile waiting to learn more about this trademark conflict, read Game Informer's review of Alan Wake 2, and then watch the official trailer for Grand Theft Auto VI, which Rockstar plans to release in 2025. \n[Source: RespawnFirst]\nDo you think these logos are similar enough to warrant a trademark dispute?

          "description": "The 2022 World War II horror game Martha is Dead is the latest video game getting a film adaptation. The game’s Italian developer LKA, is partnering with production company Studios Extraordinares to bring the psychological adventure to the big screen.\nMartha is Dead is a first-person adventure that follows identical twin sisters, Guilia, the protagonist, and Martha. Set in Tuscany in 1944, during the final stretch of World War II, the sisters are fathered by a Nazi general and have a strained relationship due to the clear favoritism Martha receives from their mother. However, Martha is suddenly found dead, and their mother mistakenly believes Guilia to be Martha, forcing her to assume her late sister’s identity. Supernatural occurrences abound centering on the malevolent entity known as the White Lady.\nThe film follows the same premise. Studios Extraordinares is led by screenwriter/directors André Hedetoft and Andreas Troedsson, and the company’s website states it’s a “creative powerhouse writing and making high-end action, horror, and science-fiction films from original stories and extraordinary games.” The studio is also working on bringing last year’s sci-fi horror game Fort Solis to TV and film, as well as a movie adaptation of the upcoming horror shooter Veil. \nWe didn’t particularly enjoy what Martha is Dead had to offer as a gameplay experience. In his review, editor Wesley LeBlanc scored the experience a 6 out of 10, writing, “LKA’s love of Italy is the only warmth I felt in Martha is Dead. The rest left me feeling as cold as Giulia’s dead sister.” Given the recent success of video game films like The Super Mario Bros. Movie and Five Nights at Freddy's, here’s hoping Martha is Dead can achieve even a fraction of that success. Or, at the very least, we hope it makes for a better movie than a video game.",

          "description": "A piracy blocking injunction handed down by an Indian court last September appears to have cost video delivery service JW Player over half of its usual website traffic from visitors in India. Plaintiffs Star India, Hotstar and Disney+ Hotstar, initially requested ISP blocking against less than 10 websites. However, since the court issued a dynamic+ injunction, they were free to keep adding domains, JW Player's included. Instructions to unblock JW Player's domain were not issued until January 9, 2024\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

Trying desperately to prove his species worth as something better than merely meat to be ground into intergalactic fast food burgers.\nThe ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for Orion Burger, the classic game by Sanctuary Woods. The engine also adds a few niceties that the original didn't have, such as mouse wheel handling, and using the spacebar to skip walk animations - something the original didn't do properly.\nHelp us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game's logic was all hardcoded, so we really need people to try all sorts of weird actions, and make sure the game handles everything correctly and matches the original implementation. And please take some screenshots along the way.\nNow, luck be with you. And remember, with the aliens cheating on the tests they set up for you, this will be no easy task.\n>",
