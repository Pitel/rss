PAX organiser ReedPop (who — full disclosure time! — is a partner of Nintendo Life and its sister sites in the Hookshot Media network) is looking to rebuild the expo after a notably tough spell for the once-great event, but it's safe to say it has encountered some bumps in the road.\nThe exact form this year's event will take and how it will differentiate itself from ReedPop's other video game events — PAX, for example — is yet to be revealed, but former Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aimé has dealt the troubled show a body blow on the socials (thanks, My Nintendo News).\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "I ain't afraid o' no ghost.\nIn the original 1998 Ring movie from director Hideo Nakata, the entire film's premise revolves around a vengeful spirit called Sadako, whose internal rage gave birth to a video tape curse via a phenomenon known as ‘thoughtography’. While Sadako is ultimately the driving force behind the film’s narrative, it’s only until the last few scenes that we finally see the spirit with our own eyes (bar a few “blink-and-you’ll-miss-it” appearances). With a total runtime of just over ninety-five minutes, Sadako is only visible for roughly fifty seconds.\nGhosts and apparitions are a lot scarier when they’re lurking in the background, unseen for the most part, only announcing their presence in subtle ways: a creaking floorboard; a piano key ringing out in an adjacent room; a soft, rattling groan seeping out of a crack in a doorway. There’s a fine balance to be struck when depicting ghosts in media - if you show too much, you run the risk of diminishing the potential impact to the audience. Examples include Pennywise from It, the Woman in Black from, uh, The Woman in Black, and - unfortunately - the plethora of ghosts found in Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Interactive launched the highly anticipated LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, an ambitious project and one that reportedly took its toll on studio employees. The game has been a sales success, selling 3.2 million copies in less than two weeks after launch, which must have come as a relief to TT studio management considering the project's troubled development. In fact, we have spoken to multiple sources confirming the cancellation of various projects at the studio featuring high-profile IP, including a Lego Disney title that was terminated just last year.\nKnown internally as 'Project Marley', this Lego game is said to have featured multiple worlds and Disney characters including Jungle Book, Nightmare Before Christmas, Pirates of the Caribbean, Maleficent, Muppets, Frozen, Toy Story, Winnie the Pooh — any animated Disney property that's had the Lego treatment, it seems — with the player exploring a large overworld and Diablo-like dungeons.

Pronty from Taiwanese indie developer 18Light makes its bid for your attention by plopping players in a dark, deep-sea environment that can be freely explored in all directions. It has some issues here or there, but Pronty overall does a great job of presenting players with an occasionally challenging and always alluring adventure that feels like a welcome addition to a crowded genre.\nPronty places you in the role of the eponymous aquatic creature who wakes up on their birthday eager to finally become an official Protector for the undersea human city of Royla. However, while running through some training drills with their robotic swordfish companion, Bront, an evil giant fish named Raksha attacks and all Protectors are immediately called in to defend the city. Given that Pronty was stationed at an outpost that’s on the very edge of the frontier, they have a long journey ahead before they can join in the counteroffensive and there are various overt and subtle hints along the way that the damage to Royla is much worse than it first seemed.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Although it was announced as part of a promo event for AMD’s Radeon RX 7000 GPUs, Infinite’s ray tracing works on any graphics card that can usually handle RT effects; all you need to do is download the update and flick it on in the display settings.\nGranted, it’s not the most visually sumptuous form of ray tracing I’ve clapped a visor on. Reflections and global illumination are unchanged, as it’s only sun shadows – shadows cast using a simulated sun as the light source – that get the RT treatment.\nRead more",

How do they have a sustainable population? What's going on here?\"\nThus, in a spirit of pure scientific enquiry, I booted up Sons Of The Forest and immediately discovered that everyone has been lying to me, because Sons Of The Forest is not a survival game. Sons Of The Forest is very clearly an early 00s b-movie action thriller. The script was left in a filing cabinet in Slough in an empty office until the office was repurposed into a call centre, at which point it was found by a middle-manager whose paintball team thought it was awesome, and somehow he sent it to a game developer by mistake. This is what happened, and you cannot convince me otherwise.\nRead more",

The game took me by surprise. So far, it's a decent time that's perhaps more along the lines of a Destiny, than say, World Of Warcraft. I genuinely believe it could garner a big community and have a bright future ahead of it - but when it comes to such a saturated space, I worry that Wayfinder may struggle to stand out, and won't attract players who are done with the usual rise 'n grind demands of these sorts of games.\nRead more",

Valve’s handheld SteamOS games machine has successfully evaded hardware flop status, currently sitting fourth in Steam’s own top sellers list a full year after it began shipping. That’s well deserved, too: the Steam Deck was a fun little alternative way to play PC games when it released, and through a combination of added features, ongoing improvements to game compatibility, and simply a wider choice of great games, it’s a better device now than it’s ever been.\r\n\n\r\nI was originally going to look back on the Steam Deck’s first 12 months with my eyes only, but what fun is a party of one? Thus I invited Valve designer Lawrence Yang and engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais for their takes on the Deck’s past, present, and future.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Once we reached about age 17 this included playing poker with a shared second-hand chip set, and trying to do beer centurions (the progress in the latter affecting our interest in the former). I was never any good at it because, though poker was a fixture for several years, I was never really able to learn the rules. What hand is good? Why has your hand beaten his hand? But the little pictures are the best, I don't understand! It's disappointing because understanding poker is a cool adult thing, plus not understanding it makes certain pivotal scenes in James Bond films quite hard to parse.\nLast week we got an email (shout out Aidan) singing the praises of Aces And Adventures, and I do try to check out recommendations from readers, even if I don't have time to reply or to write about the games. In this case I've made a special because Aces And Adventures is a great game that is teaching me winning poker hands through the medium of a dwarven warrior smashing things.\nRead more",

Apols if you were caught in the crossfire for that, but dragon fever was running high off the back of a still very cool trailer, and shouting Fus Ro Dah was the only cure. \nIn the years since, Skyrim has been released and re-released many times, on every conceivable platform. \"Arrow to the knee\" jokes became de rigueur and hacky almost overnight, and at this point might have horse-shoed back around to being funny again. There are many examples of unrelated games or videos that cut to black fading back up into the opening of Skyrim, in a kind of sub-genre of rickroll. Does it hold up now? Kind of.

It's been 15 years since I last visited family in Yokohama, and my last memory is one where I'm miserable and I'm staring out of a cab window going back to the airport. I didn't want to leave. It sounds corny as heck, but I can't wait to sucker punch that memory with a swing that's been building for 5478 days, then jab it full of happy ones. Really, I imagine what will happen is I'll get weirdly emotional as the plane touches down and my mate Simon, who I'm going with, will be like, \"Get a hold of yourself you buffoon\".\nI got LINE recently -  a Whatsapp equivalent that's big in Japan - to arrange some meetups with friends and family. Those arrangements have happened, which brings me great joy. But in a surprise plot twist, it meant I got back in touch with a guy called Sam. Now Sam, he's a good bud and we go a long way back. All the way back to the original Gears Of War days. And I think we've arranged, as is custom, to play Gears 6 whenever it arrives. Such is the bizarre way of things.\nRead more",

Despite dipping their toes into the sci-fi realm with Age Of Wonders: Planetfall three-odd years ago, developers Triumph are now returning to their fantastical 4X strategy roots with Age Of Wonders 4, due out on PC in just a couple of months on May 2nd - and what a homecoming it's shaping up to be. I've spent the better part of a week and half playing an early build of AOW 4, getting to grips with its enormous array of customizable factions and hero types in its generous crop of single-player realm maps. \r\n\n\r\nThere's a heck of a lot to get through, but rest assured: this is Age Of Wonders through and through - and thanks to the addition of those new, customizable factions, it's also the most RPG-like entry yet, which is good news for budding D&D-ers looking for a grand, 4X strategy game to sink their teeth into. Heck, I'd even go as far as saying it could be one of this year's biggest and most exciting fantasy games outside of Baldur's Gate 3. \r\n\n \nRead more",

And crucially, it's more approachable as a result. Clever ranks and meters reward, whether risk-taking is your jam or you're more of a careful type. It may still be a tricky venture filled with demonic, titanic cows that'll want to pound your skull into the dirt, but this is Team Ninja's most encouraging effort yet.\nRead more",

It just seemed like a fun thing to do… until I did it.” \r\n\n\r\nLaidlaw first discovered that community in the mid 90s, in the office of Valve, where Gabe Newell and team were already hard at work on Half-Life. “I’d seen bits and pieces of the levels they were working on, but as soon as I heard the name, I just got this amazing buzz,” Laidlaw says. “I could see the whole world they were aiming at somehow, and I felt it was a collective vision. This is one reason it’s so weird to me when people try to attribute authorship to me that I’ve never felt. It was all there when I got there, in embryo.”\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "One of the best things a survival game can do is make you want to share your latest experiences with your family and friends At this, Sons Of The Forest succeeds in grand fashion. Often I found myself pausing the game so I could go find my brother and tell him about the latest Big Thing that had just happened. Some of the time, it's even for the right reasons. Perhaps I'd spotted a group of cannibals adopting some startlingly intelligent behaviour. Or maybe one of my NPC companions had just done something particularly endearing in front of me.\nOr, more likely, I'd witnessed another example of the incredible jankiness which, like the island's flesh-nibbling denizens, loves to raid and pillage its way through nearly every aspect of the game. Perhaps I'd just cut down a tree and watched it soar high into the air, glitching all over the place like some demonic new type of tree mutant. Maybe Kelvin had just taken my instruction to gather logs a bit too literally, and deconstructed the entire west side of my house while I wasn't looking.\nSons Of The Forest's great strength is its ability to utterly transport you into its threatening, unsettling, but genuinely beautiful world. It quickly builds up the player's trust until they're ready to wholeheartedly buy into what at times feels like the next generation of open-world survival and crafting games. But then, at least in its current Early Access state, it breaks that trust just as quickly with a melange of unintuitive systems, game-breaking bugs, and a painful lack of content that makes one of the most gorgeous environments in games feel awfully hollow after a while.\nRead more",

That time is divided into five-second chunks during which you're shown what the enemy will do, and must use that to coordinate your own mechs, placing their orders on a visible timeline. You finish your turn by hitting a button that makes everyone go at once for a few explosive moments.\nIn practice, behind those few seconds are an eternity of theorising, testing, and tweaking. There's probably a metaphor in there somewhere about writing, video editing, or catering.

That’ll be either a GTX 1070 Ti or a Radeon RX 5600 XT. \r\n\n\r\nConsternation at the star-high starting specs prompted Private Division community lead Michael Loreno to pen a forum post explaining the requirements, suggesting they were subject to change as further optimisations are added and that \"the game is certainly playable on machines below our min spec.\" Sadly, I’ve been finding that several of the most-used GPUs among Steam users – including the immensely popular GTX 1060 – are likely to face serious performance woes in KSP2’s current state.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I have, genuinely, been trying to get plants for my office area (desk in the corner of the living room) for like nine months now. If my need for plants were a child, it would have been born. I had a decent pot plant called James Plant back in the UK, but when I moved I bequeathed James Plant to Graham - and, now that I think about it, Graham hasn't told me how James Plant is doing, so I should probably check in on that.\nI know that digital plants do not replace real plants in a physical sense - i.e. I am getting no oxygenating benefit from them - but the little plants in Garden In! make me happy. And I've just realised the name is a pun, too.\nRead more",

That’s why I’m intrigued by Plasma, a spacey physics-driven engineering game that lets players build a variety of robot friendos, useful machines, and generally wild contraptions. Plasma comes from Patrick Corrieri and Marco Bancale, who have previously worked on the Poly Bridge series and the tense Kingdom games. Their new creative engineering sim is heading into early access on March 30th, and I can’t wait to see what people make.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "There are plenty of great games based on books, but I’ve never seen an adaptation as unconventional as The Forest Cathedral, a dramatic reimagining of Rachel Carson’s science book from the ‘60s, Silent Spring. Carson’s book investigated the pesticide known as DDT, its harmful environmental impacts, and the misinformation that allowed companies to indiscriminately use it. The Forest Cathedral reimagines this series of events as partly a first-person walking sim across the woods and partly a 2D platformer set inside scanning equipment. So, yeah, not exactly a one-to-one adaptation. \r\n\n \nRead more",

In fact, this processor is down to £177 at Amazon UK at present, meaning it's rapidly approaching half of its £329 UK RRP. \nYes, I know the CPU pictured is the 5800X. Please don't tell anyone!

Pravidelná každoměsíční online setkání s diskuzí nad tématy ze světa vědy a techniky, zejména z praktického pohledu, často ale i s nadhledem a humorem, jejichž tradice vznikla za Covidového lockdownu. Tak jaká témata si bastlíři z projektu MacGyver.sh připravili na toto jubilejní 24. setkání? Určitě bude zmíněna statistika samotné Virtuální Bastlírny. Zajímalo by Vás kolik unikátních návštěvníků se v online prostoru bastlírenského Zoomu již sešlo a kolik bastlířo-hodin prodiskutovalo?\r\n\r\nZe světa HW pak kluci vyhrabali 100 MSa/s osciloskop postavený na RP2040, energeticky úspornou technologii pro přenos dat mezi senzory umístěnými na lidském těle, nové velice levné ARMy pod 5 Kč a nové procesory od ST, požár v továrně na čipy, falešné CO2 monitory, Raspberry debug probe, nový nástroj na tvorbu plošných spojů nebo blížící se semináře a webináře o elektronice.\r\n\r\nZa SW zase třeba zbrusu nový KiCAD 7.0.0, emulace zvukové karty Gravis Ultrasound na RP2040, probíhající standardizace šifrovacích algoritmů pro IoT, podpora Bluetooth v Rpi Pico SDK, jak se dělá raytracing na FPGA nebo spolupráce mezi projekty KiCAD a Inventree.\r\n\r\nAť už vás zaujalo cokoliv z nabízených témat, chcete ukázat nějaký svůj bastl a nebo si jen potřebujete postěžovat na nedostatek volného času, dorazte! Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v úterý 7. března od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

          "description": "Now you can be insulted on a whole new platform\nSony has released the latest firmware update for its princely gaming platform PlayStation 5 (PS5) — The 23.01 update is now available to download to the console, weighing it at a little over the 1GB mark.\nPerhaps the most notable addition here is the long, long-time coming integration of the Discord service, which will let PS5 users sync their current Discord accounts to the PS5 console, offering up new ways of communication with friends, enemies, and new enemies. The PS5 Discord service will also allow for game invites, party chat, and even screen sharing. Thus, it will be a useful tool for anybody who frequently plays with friends, or likes to make meandering, half-interested conversations while gaming.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2sHOKZCYkg&t=1s&ab_channel=PlayStation\nIn addition to Discord, the new update offers up a fistful of new technical features. These include a 1440p Variable Refresh Rate option (provided you have games and displays to support such an option). The DualSense controller can now update wirelessly, and PS5 to PS5 data transfer can now be made over Wi-Fi (ah wouldn't).\nIn a neat touch, Game Capture can now be activated by voice, allowing players to simply call out \"Hey PlayStation, capture that\" for an instant recording of recent gameplay, without having to break their flow fiddling through menus. This tool is particularly cool if you're somebody who frequently shares clips online. I still feel weird talking to my console. But then, I feel weird talking to anyone.\nThis just scratches the surface of the new update, which also includes an improved Screen Reader, revised folder filters, and new library options for PSVR 2 titles. For full details on Version 23.01, check out the official patch notes over on the official PlayStation Blog.\nThe post Discord among new features in today’s PS5 firmware update appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Physical edition hits PlayStation today\nWhen we reviewed The Rumble Fish 2 in December 2022, we were quick to praise its unique style and great gameplay, but fairly chastised the old-school scrapper for forgetting some hugely important features — vital to any modern fighter, re-released or otherwise. Fortunately, a new update for the cult release will address some of these misgivings today.\nThe new update, live now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms, contains several vital online options, these include a new Spectator Mode for waiting players, as well as a rematch option at the end of each fight, saving you from having to return to the lobby and search for the same opponent. Additionally, a new indicator will give players a heads-up on their opponent's connectivity, and will also offer the ability to reject a match if the connection is poor.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHBPAQzu_nQ&ab_channel=3goo\nThe Training Mode has also been tweaked, offering multiple settings for your training dummy, as well as adjustable recovery options for your meters. The Training Mode will also now allow you to save your lab settings for future sessions. Finally, the match timer can now be set to 99 seconds max, and a new \"Combat Range\" option should prevent a frustrating bug that was causing combos to drop in widescreen ratio. These adjustments will help bring the rerelease up to par with some other fighters, and a further update is expected in April.\nIn related news, indie publisher Clear River Games has launched a physical edition of The Rumble Fish 2 on PlayStation platforms, with a Nintendo Switch edition releasing on March 28. You can order the physical edition from game retailers in Europe and North America, while the digital edition is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post The Rumble Fish 2 update adds important key features appeared first on Destructoid.",

Beyond the additions of Chrom, Robin, and Veronica: the patch also has two changes, in addition to \"issues that have been fixed to make for a more pleasant gaming experience\" (thanks for the specifics!).\nFor one, you'll be able to exchange items at the ancient well in the Somniel hub, after talking to the proprietor of the armory. You can also use inherit skills in the arena. Small potatoes for sure, but hopefully all of these patches will sprinkle in quality of life changes like this: just like the prior February 8 patch added the recreation interaction to the pool, orchard, and stable zones in the hub.\nMore features in the hangout hub is a great thing!

The new expansion will be bringing new songs and weapons to the award-winning actioner on March 29.\nTwo new headbangin' tracks will be included in the DLC. The first will feature the powerhouse vocals of Lacuna Coil frontwoman Cristina Scabbia, who I've super-duper fancied for literal decades, but don't tell her I said that because I'm shy. The second track is performed by Will Ramos of New Jersey's Lorna Shore, who I haven't heard of, but don't tell them I said that because I'm super-duper old. The searing vocals of both artists will soundtrack your next trip out of the underworld.\nhttps://twitter.com/MetalHellsinger/status/1633120493497638913?s=20\nIn addition to the new songs, the Metal: Hellsinger Dream of the Beast DLC will also include a devastating new machine gun \"The Red Right Hand\", as well as a selection of new player skins that will add new modifiers to the game. So, even if you've already run this unique and super-cool shooter into the ground, it seems that the new update will give you more than enough reason to bust out the devil horns once again.

Thus far the key info we've gotten seems to be \"first-person mode\" (likely similar to how no-build is a separate, hopefully permanent mode now), and a neon aesthetic. A new tweet from Epic Games appears to confirm the latter.\nhttps://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1633120555153989636\nThe tweet is classically \"Fortnite vague\", and just reconfirms the neon setting that has been present in leaks and rumors this past week. The phrase \"made with precision\" seems to be referring to the chef in the picture (who could be a skin), teasing players to \"prepare for Fortnite Mega\" (which could simply be the nomenclature of the new season/zone). As usual the marketing for Fortnite is on point; as there's a combination of rumor-spreading, speculation, and semi-confirmation that's just enough to talk about.

With Metroid Prime’s fantastic remaster in recent memory and Resident Evil 4’s remake just up ahead, those of us who like to re-experience old favorites with re-done visuals are eating good. Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse is something special, however. Originally released exclusively on Wii in 2008, it never left Japan. While the re-release of Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water was apparently enough to warrant a remaster, I’m surprised Koei Tecmo would go to the effort of localizing such a niche title.\nI’m glad they did.

          "description": "It was... inevitable\nThe extremely compelling mobile card game Marvel Snap has had a stupendous launch, having raked in just over $50 million USD in revenue since its launch on iOS and Android platforms in October 2022.\nThe digital tabletop title — the first game from Californian studio Second Dinner — sees players build a deck of heroes and villains from the famous comic book brand, before going to battle in strategic, turn-based gameplay. Players can earn or purchase various new cards in order to build up their deck, and take part in limited-time events, seasons, and tournaments. Currently, the title is enjoying an Ant-Man-themed event, in collaboration with the recent Marvel Cinematic Universe release Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNuq6E3enZQ&ab_channel=MarvelEntertainment\nDue to the exciting nature of the game's roster as well as a short playtime of only a few minutes — Marvel Snap won over a huge community of players at Quicksilver speed. Roughly 12 million players downloaded the title in its launch month with around $30 million in revenue pulled in by January of this year. Of course, many mobile titles enjoy this burst of incredible success in their opening six months, and time will tell whether Marvel Snap will continue to grow over the remainder of 2023. But given the popularity of the Marvel brand, and the overall quality of the game itself. I would expect those microtransaction bucks to keep rolling in for the foreseeable future.\nMarvel Snap is available now on iOS and Android platforms.

It’s currently slated as a Nintendo Switch exclusive.\nFront Mission 2 was released on Sony’s original PlayStation way back in 1997. Notably, this entry in the series never left Japan. It takes place 12 years after Front Mission 1st, showing a future Bangladesh (renamed Alordesh) as they seek to sever ties from the OCU. The narrative baton is passed between three protagonists as they discover a conspiracy behind the anti-OCU coup d’etat.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/NQrghowLZvY[/embed]\nThe remake boasts new visuals, a free-zoom ability to get right in close to your Wanzers, and a “renewed” soundtrack. Underneath the modern gloss, Front Mission 2 Remake “preserves the mature story, strategic turn-based combat, and Wanzer customization options of the original.”\nWhile the Front Mission 1st: Remake didn’t set my world on fire, it did leave me primed for the sequel. Beyond simply being fun strategy games, I love tinkering with the Wanzers to create the ultimate stompy force.

Vanillaware and NIS America are releasing a demo for GrimGrimoire OnceMore, for PlayStation and Nintendo Switch.\nSet in a magical school, GrimGrimoire OnceMore follows the very eventful early days of Lillet Blan. As things get bad, she'll eventually have to put her schooling to use in the form of side-scrolling strategy warfare using familiars and grimoires.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YO4B3IEaCJU\nOnceMore is a remaster of Vanillaware's original GrimGrimoire, a 2007 PlayStation 2 strategy game. And it looks like the developer's putting together a pretty solid list of improvements to the original experience.\nAn altered screen ratio and updated resolution help on the graphics side. Grand Magic spells, an added Skill Tree, and the Tactical Notebook all serve to offer more to do on the gameplay side of things, too. And a new Gallery features illustrations from Vanillaware staff, with over 90 images created for GrimGrimoire and OnceMore.\nCast a spell on you\nThis isn't the first time Vanillaware's brought forward one of its earlier hits to modern systems. The absolutely superb Odin Sphere Leifthrasir put the action-RPG back in the conversation. (Side note: I do hope that eventually gets a Switch or Steam port.)\nMeanwhile, 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim made a fairly big impact for Vanillaware. With that in mind, it's neat to see them going back to the vault and pulling out a piece of the studio's history that feels linked, if only by the strategy genre. Today's GrimGrimoire demo should give players an idea of just how it's evolved over the years, and a taste of what's to come from the remaster.\nGrimGrimoire OnceMore hits PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch on April 4, 2023.\nThe post GrimGrimoire OnceMore gets a demo today on PlayStation and Switch appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Unlimited barricades?!\nWith the launch of Destiny 2: Lightfall came a new Darkness subclass, Strand. Whilst the initial fan reception to Strand was pretty underwhelming, as time has gone on the more dedicated players have had time to dig deep into the new subclass and come up with some powerful new builds. We've already covered Warlocks and Hunters, with armies of Threadlings and infinite enemy suspension all possible. This time we're going to take a look at the space shooter's brutes, the Titans.\nWe're looking to create a build that will give unlimited barricades to protect against incoming enemy fire as well as turn you into a suspending machine. We're obviously going to be using the Strand subclass, and some important aspects, fragments, and armor mods to help achieve that.\nAspects and …",

          "description": "Getting lost in Hyrule Field all over again\nModder RiazorMC is at it again, and their latest fan-created track happens to be the \"Ocarina of Time Circuit\" for Mario Kart 8. Note that yes, Mario Kart 8 has gotten official Zelda DLC in the past with Hyrule Circuit: but not necessarily in a purely retro format. This track aims to bring back the 1998 Nintendo 64 classic in full force, steering through a big chunk of the overworld. Like several other Mario Kart tracks that shift zones across multiple laps, this track zooms across multiple major areas of Ocarina of Time, and hits many of the bigger notes.\nHere's how the track plays out:\nLap 1: Gerudo's Fortress (also the Kokiri Forest)\nLap 2: Lake Hylia\nLap 3: Death Mountain (across Hyrule Field)\nThe course takes you through pretty much all of Hyrule Field, and has a pretty intense/semi-confusing layout to boot. It would take multiple attempts to really figure out where to go since the signs aren't very pronounced, and several of the locations (including riding up the narrow ascent of Death Mountain, as well as navigating the depths of Lake Hylia) are tricky.\nWith some refinement, this could be a legit course I would definitely play. Hopefully Nintendo has more crossovers in the works for their Mario Kart 8 Deluxe DLC tracks (and beyond, on whatever inevitable next series entry is being worked on now). I've said this for years, but I can see Nintendo doing a Mario Kart All-Stars game at some point, especially once the franchise hits critical mass.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAbiHtV7A0g\n[Thanks Rich!]\nThe post This fan-created Zelda: Ocarina of Time Mario Kart 8 track is a trip down memory lane appeared first on Destructoid.",

I just didn’t expect it to be so soon this year, and honestly, it probably shouldn’t have been. As a fan of both Castlevania and dating sims, you couldn’t throw a bowling ball further up my alley. It’s like inviting me to an afternoon of tea and ToeJam & Earl. I am there. I am already there.\nHowever, my impressions of Romancelvania’s early demo haven’t been forgotten. My worry was that meshing the two concepts was an ambition out of reach of a small team.

Additionally, a presentation showcasing more of the game called Starfield Direct will air on June 11. \nIn a new video hosted by game director Todd Howard, he states the Direct in June – which happens to be the weekend before E3 starts – will provide a \"deep dive\" into the game. He reiterates that Starfield is a unique experience that also has many of the hallmarks fans expect from a Bethesda title. We last saw Starfield during the Xbox Game Showcase last summer, where Bethesda revealed its extensive scope, including thousands of planets, spaceship construction, environmental scanning, and other features. \n\n\nStarfield was originally slated to launch on November 11, 2022, before getting delayed. It was later reconfirmed to launch within the first half of 2023, and though September sits on the second half of the calendar, we're happy to see the game get a concrete date again. \nStarfield will be available on Xbox Series X/S and PC and will also launch day one on Xbox Game Pass.",

The main story unfolds across three interconnected campaigns set on land, the sea, and the sky and features a new cast of commanders. It also features a new roguelike campaign called Conquest that tasks players to complete a series of smaller battles while making permanent choices and relying on the same pool of units, health, and resources. \n\n\nWargroove 2 features four-player co-op and versus battles (local and online) along with rule customization and asynchronous play. An in-game editor allows players to create custom maps, campaigns, and even cutscenes to share with other players. \nThe first Wargroove was lauded as a fun throwback to Advance Wars when it launched in 2019, so we’re excited to see what Chucklefish has in store for the follow-up. Wargroove 2 doesn’t have a release window, but it’s slated to launch on Switch and PC. You can read out review of the first game here.",

Fatal Frame is a game all about fighting ghosts in haunted locations with a magic camera, but this will be the first time you can pause the game and take pictures in the contemporary \"photo mode\" way we are all now familiar with.\nThis episode of New Gameplay Today ended up being a long one, making it feel a bit closer to our Super Replay series where Marcus Stewart and myself have been playing classic horror games like Dino Crisis and Silent Hill.

Their revolution will shatter Damcai's deceptive peace – a peace built with the blood and sweat of mages. The Mageseeker provides an action-packed fantasy gameplay experience for those looking to experience a story of power, identity, and justice.\" \nRiot Games also revealed today that it is selling a physical Collector's Edition of the game for $169.99.

Dream of the Beast also adds The Red Right Hand, a new machine gun, and three new outfits, each of which provide unique gameplay modifiers.\nThese updates join the game as part of the Dream of the Beast DLC, but players who don't purchase the premium content also have something to be excited for. The same day the DLC arrives, players can expect a free title update for Metal Hellsinger. This free update adds a new song selection feature.\nBoth of these updates arrive on March 29 on all platforms. The game, which took home Game Informer's \"Best Shooter\" award for 2022, is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. For more on Metal: Hellsinger, check out our review here. You can also read our interview with System of a Down singer Serj Tankian, who contributed to the base game's soundtrack, right here.",

For each model type, there's a (Warrior of) Light version and a Dark version, which basically equates to white and blue-green, and black and purple-pink. All four of the shoes look great but before you get too attached, these shoes are Japan-only for now. There's no word on if they'll come to the U.S. \nCheck out the shoes in the gallery below: \n\nEach of these shoes will cost 17,050 yen, which is roughly $125, according to Techraptor. They will be released in Japan next week on March 15. \nShoes inspired by video games have risen in popularity, with Converse releasing two sets of Pokémon-inspired shoes last year. Perhaps more than any other shoe maker, though, Puma has been steadily releasing video game shoes. In 2018, it released a pair of sneakers based on Sonic the Hedgehog's iconic red shoes and then in 2020, Puma released a line of Super Mario All-Stars shoes. Puma announced some NBA 2K21 shoes in 2021 and then just two months later, the company revealed an Animal Crossing: New Horizons line of sneakers. \nWhile waiting to learn more, read Game Informer's Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker review. \n[Source: Techraptor]\nWhat do you think of these Final Fantasy XIV shoes?

However, its success is only possible through standing on the shoulders of the giants that trailblazed the genre. Of all the franchises Dead Cells drew inspiration from, perhaps no series was as influential as Castlevania. Because of this, the crossover between the two, which comes in the form of premium DLC for Dead Cells called Return to Castlevania, is a natural fit that not only resurrects Konami's dormant franchise but gives a nostalgic shot in the arm to one of the best roguelites available today.\nDiving back into Dead Cells for the first time in years, I couldn't help but effortlessly fall back into the hooks of the stellar gameplay loop.

          "description": "Bandai Namco has revealed a new Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi game. \nYesterday, the publisher released a short teaser trailer for the game, running less than a minute, that highlights footage from previous Budokai Tenkaichi games before showcasing what appears to be the new one. In the footage of the new game, we see Goku powering up. And then the words, \"Get Ready For Battle\" and \"A New Sparking Begins\" appear on screen. \nCheck it out in the Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi teaser trailer for yourself below: \n／\n「ドラゴンボール Sparking！」シリーズ\n#ドラゴンボール #バトルアワー pic.twitter.com/VMMPWWeSUr\nMarch 5, 2023\nAs you can see, the game might be called, in some variation, Dragon Ball Sparking (that's what the tweet calls it if you use Twitter's built-in translate function, too). But regardless, the trailer ends with \"A New Budokai Tenkaichi\" begins, quelling any doubt that this is a new game in the series that has laid dormant for 16 years. Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3 was released in 2007.  \nThe teaser trailer doesn't indicate if this is Budokai Tenkaichi 4 or something else but it's exciting nonetheless to see that Bandai Namco hasn't forgotten about the series. It is somewhat surprising to see this announcement, though, considering Dragon Ball FighterZ exists. Budokai Tenkaichi is a fighting game series as well but to see a new one before a sequel to FighterZ, which was released in 2018, is something I imagine not many people could have predicted. \nWhile waiting to learn more about this Budokai Tenkaichi game, read Game Informer's Dragon Ball FighterZ review. \nAre you excited for a new Budokai Tenkaichi game?

          "description": "Yosuke Matsuda, president and representative director of Square Enix, is stepping down after 10 years in the position. \nThe official announcement states that he’ll be replaced by the relatively new Takahashi Kiryu, a company director who joined Square in 2020, as part of an organizational restructuring. The proposed change will be voted for approval at the 43rd Annual Shareholder’s Meeting in June. Square Enix’s reason for the change is as follows:\nMatsuda became president in 2013, succeeding Yoichi Wada as part of a massive restructuring. His time at the top could be viewed as a bit of a rollercoaster. He pushed for innovation in Square’s flagship franchise, Final Fantasy, and voiced commitment to remaking and re-releasing popular titles from Square’s back catalog, such as Final Fantasy VII. The MMO Final Fantasy XIV also became a global phenomenon under his watch, though the company as a whole has largely struggled to land a massive success outside of the franchise. In recent years, high-profile Square Enix-published titles such as Marvel’s Avengers and Babylon’s Fall had disappoitning releases, with the former ceasing development this year and the latter shutting down this week. \nPerhaps most infamously, Matsuda was also at the front of Square’s tumultuous relationships with its North American third-party publishers, namely Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal, whose titles such as the Tomb Raider reboot trilogy, Deus Ex, and Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy were often deemed commercial disappointments. That came to a head last May, when Square Enix sold off these studios and their IPs to Embracer Group.\nIn recent times, Matsuda was also a vocal advocate for NFTs and blockchain gaming. In January, he published a letter detailing upcoming company initiatives, including making games that incorporate blockchain technology.",

Once Fusion is live with NSO, players can finally experience Samus Aran's full 2D series journey on the Nintendo Switch, starting with the original Metroid game all the way through Metroid Fusion and 2021's Metroid Dread. \nCheck out the Metroid Fusion Nintendo Switch Online trailer announcing the news below: \n\n\n\"In Metroid Fusion, interstellar bounty hunter Samus Aran is attacked by an X parasite while exploring the mysterious planet SR388,\" Nintendo's description of the game reads. \"This organism is not only deadly, but it can mimic the abilities of any creature it infects – including Samus herself! Saved from the brink thanks to an infusion of Metroid DNA, the X parasite's only natural predator, she soon discovers that the parasite has spread to the research station orbiting SR388. Weakened and out of options, Samus must do whatever it takes to destroy the X threat before it's too late.\" \nNintendo says Metroid Fusion contains \"a multitude of secrets\" for players to experience that links Super Metroid to Metroid Dread. \nSpeaking of Metroid Dread, read Game Informer's review of it to find out why it was one of our favorite games of 2021, and then read Game Informer's Metroid Prime Remastered review.

You can use your high-pressure hose to blast dirt and grime off of popular locations in Midgar, and the best part is that the experience is totally free.\nThe Midgar Special Pack is available now for all versions of Powerwash Simulator. It adds five new levels, including Tifa’s Seventh Heaven bar and the Mako Energy Exhibit. Additionally, you’ll be cleaning up vehicles and mechs such as Cloud’s Hardy-Daytona motorcycle, Shinra Hauler, the Scorpion Sentinal, and the Airbuster. The pack also adds new dirt types, such as bio-residue. \n\n\nThis DLC was created in collaboration with Square Enix, with Final Fantasy VII Remake director Tetsuya Nomura writing in a press release, \n“When I heard about the proposal for a collab, I was quite busy with various other collabs and reviews, but I was especially excited about this one. I had just been playing PowerWash Simulator and was daydreaming about cleaning things from my titles. My immediate response was, 'let’s wash the entire Shinra building.' Unfortunately, that seemed to be a bit difficult, but the final line-up is exciting, nonetheless. This is something I have been looking forward to a lot, and hope everyone has a great time!”\nThis pack follows a Tomb Raider-themed expansion that launched in January. This is a pretty neat trend, and see other video game properties added to the game that are in need of good clean-up. \nPowerwash Simulator is available now for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC.",

For Asmussen, Cal's story has always been a trilogy in his head. \n\"We were already talking about the second game,\" said Asmussen. \"I mean, frankly, we were talking beyond. And these are conversations that, when we're breaking this story with Lucasfilm, it's like: 'Well, where are we going with the second game?' I always wanted to see this as a trilogy. How can we take Cal and the crew to new places beyond what we were doing in the first game.\" \nAsmussen continues, stating that Respawn had a good idea of where Survivor, which is due out April 28, takes place in terms of the Star Wars timeline. The team also knew what the stakes were going to be, what the tone was going to be, what Cal was going to be up against, and how his crew was going to be factored into all of that. On top of that, Respawn thinks about the ideas \"that we could do beyond that as well.\" \nStar Wars Jedi: Survivor was originally due out March 17, but was delayed to April 28.

          "description": "Telltale Games has announced that The Wolf Among Us 2 has been delayed and will now arrive in 2024. In a statement to IGN, the team explains it wants to avoid crunching the team and releasing an unfinished product as it moves development into Unreal Engine 5.\nTelltale released a brief message on Twitter announcing the delay, but CEO Jamie Ottilie shares more context with IGN. Ottilie discusses the challenges of relaunching the studio in 2019, which were then compounded when the COVID-19 pandemic began the following year. That includes announcing the game when the studio was still staffing up to help secure early funding. Despite those early hurdles, Ottilie states that development has been going well since then, but the team recently decided it wants to adopt Unreal 5 to take advantage of the engine’s new features. Unfortunately, that meant having to redo a lot of the work that had been created in Unreal 4.\nWith such a big change, Ottilie explains that the only way The Wolf Among Us 2 could still arrive this year would be either to launch it in a less-polished state (which the team wants to avoid given its high expectations) or to overwork the staff. Given that the old Telltale was infamous for crunch and burnout, Ottilie is adamant about avoiding the same practice with this iteration of the studio. \n\"I've done [crunch], and I don't want to do it again, and it's not fair to ask it,\" Ottilie tells IGN. \"You can't plan a business around it. So yeah, part of it is about maintaining a healthy work culture. We don't want to burn out our good people.”\nThe Wolf Among Us 2 was announced at the 2019 Game Awards and will be an episodic title like its predecessor. However, Telltale is developing each episode at the same time, so the entire series will be complete when the first installment launches. You can watch the first full trailer from last year here. The studio’s other project, The Expanse: A Telltale Series, is still slated for this year. \n[Source: IGN]",

          "description": "With Diablo IV, Blizzard aims to revamp the danger-infested hellscape of Sanctuary. The world’s five explorable regions – Kehjistan, Scosglen, Fractured Peaks, Dry Steppes, and Hawezar – offer their own flavors of topography, cultures, quests, and, of course, monsters. Blizzard is going to great lengths to ensure these regions are not only fun for players to explore, but feature more narrative cohesion and a stronger sense of place. \nDiablo veterans have explored regions of Sanctuary before, but this time they’re more than one-note areas highlighting a single climate or element, such as snow or desert. Each of them is biodiverse in its own right, with multiple biomes and threats exclusive to them. These realms also blend more naturally together; the lush green of one area gradually withers…",

It was during this meeting that the entire QA team at the Lousiana office was \"disbanded,\" according to Kotaku. \nThe publication reached out to EA looking for a response to the mass layoffs, but the publisher opted not to directly address it, instead stating that as \"part of its ongoing global strategy, we are expanding the distribution of our Apex Legends testing team and ending execution that's been concentrated in Baton Rouge, Lousiana, impacting services provided by our third-party provider.\" Be sure to check out Kotaku's write-up for the full statement from EA and additional context surrounding the layoffs, the Lousiana office, and more. \n[Source: Kotaku]",

It’s easily the farthest a mainline Final Fantasy game has ever been from its traditional turn-based roots, with FFXVI being easily the most action-heavy yet. That’s not surprising, though, considering the game’s combat director is Ryota Suzuki, a former Capcom developer with nearly 20 years of experience designing the action in games like Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Devil May Cry 4, and most recently, Devil May Cry 5. \nWith such a personal connection to Devil May Cry, I couldn’t resist asking: Who would win in a one-on-one fight: FFXVI protagonist Clive or Devil May Cry 5 lead Dante? Suzuki had to answer this question with two of his bosses right beside him – FFXVI director Hiroshi Takai and producer Naoki Yoshida – so perhaps we should take this answer with a grain of salt. But I don’t know, having played both Devil May Cry 5 and two hours of FFXVI during a recent hands-on preview (read about that here), I’m inclined to believe him. \nHis answer, with a sly smile and a laugh: Clive. \nSuzuki says Clive’s Eikonic abilities, which allow him to tap into the power of Eikons like Phoenix and Titan, give him the ultimate edge. And just for fun, I asked who would win in a fight between Clive and Nero. \n“Clive.” \nThere you have it, very specific fans of both Final Fantasy and Devil May Cry 5 like me; Clive wins.",
