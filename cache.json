Well, in Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, it can very easily ruin your strategies.\nIn the Pokémon games, there is a statistic that's often called \"friendship\" or \"affection\", which can affect a few different mechanics in the game. It tells the player how close that Pokémon is to them, and it can be raised through things like levelling up that Pokémon, catching it in a Luxury Ball, or letting it hold a Soothe Bell. Certain Pokémon, like Sylveon, will only evolve once the Pokémon has high enough friendship/affection.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

With Switch systems and the PS5s in particular being hard to find in Japan, one man entrusted with a significant amount of stock for delivery ended up selling them privately for a profit.\nIt was confirmed by police in Tokyo that a man was arrested after selling around 200 consoles and games. The unemployed man (Japanese media often reports employment status when reporting arrests) was given the goods for home deliveries in October, but instead sold them to stores in the popular Akihabara district; the value of the goods was reportedly around 5.8 million yen (approx $51,100USD) with the man's profit from his sales reportedly being just over half that amount.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It's a welcome change because Nintendo systems have historically lagged a little behind other consoles in the FPS field despite hosting some classics. After all, GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark helped define the FPS on consoles, and the Metroid Prime series shifted the exploration of the 2D Metroids into a first-person perspective to great effect. Still, Nintendo consoles have often missed out on the best multiplatform shooters.\nThe success of Switch is changing all that, though, and we've seen a raft of FPS games arrive on the handheld hybrid. From remade classics to seemingly 'impossible' ports, there's now plenty to chose from, and with Metroid Prime 4 lingering stubbornly over the horizon, there's never been a better time to gear up like John Matrix, light a cigar and blast through the demonic hordes on your handheld.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Their ShotTriggers series has delivered a bounty of ports of iconic shmups that are often so good it can be tempting to posit that they trump the originals.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It was a mix of sports that demonstrated the capabilities of the system's Wii Remote and motion controls at the time.\nIf you've ever wondered what's beyond the boundaries of the game, then you might want to take a look at the new Boundary Break video. While the same channel has already covered this game (about five years ago), it's now taken a second look - presenting viewers with all sorts of things they may not have even realised were featured within the game.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

For the most part, feedback from the test looked pretty good, though some players noticed something a familiar - the game reused armour and emotes from Final Fantasy XIV. Producer Yosuke Saito says that's because Square Enix let Platinum borrow them, letting the devs add lots more gear than they had originally planned.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I’ve seen capital ships on fire off the shoulder of Mars, watched sniper scopes glitter in the smog near Brandenburg Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.\nUnless I can record them in a big list, of course, clawing back some of that sunk cost in the process. While the COD campaign no longer holds the high ground at the water cooler, where it once dominated pop culture discussion, it’s still a place you can reliably find solo thrills in a world of service shooters. You might be surprised to learn that, despite diminishing returns, some of the best examples are hidden among the duds of the last decade. I’ve made it my duty to point them out to you - the spotter to your artillery.\nRead more",

That game is The Vale: Shadow Of The Crown, an audio-only RPG about a blind princess fighting to save her kingdom. You may have seen it nominated in the Innovation in Accessibility category of The Game Awards this year, and frankly if it doesn't win then a great disservice will have been done. A stark contrast to the other, all very AAA nominees in its category, The Vale doesn't rely on flashy visuals to tell its story. In fact, it barely has any graphics at all. Instead, it conjures its world - and tense fighting sequences - from sound alone, creating an experience like nothing else I've ever played. \nRead more",

Now, what with it being Black Friday and all, it’s hit a new lowest price of £60 – a 33% saving.\r\n\n\r\nFor such anti-riches I can’t recommend any other tenkey-equipped, fully mechanical keyboard more; indeed, it held the ‘best cheap mechanical gaming keyboard’ title on our best keyboards list well before this discount revealed itself. The only thing missing here is USB pass-through, but N-key rollover, a volume dial, a detachable wrist rest, macro recording and RGB backlighting are all part of the deal. \r\n\n\r\nSadly I haven’t found such a drastic saving for US buyers, though Amazon has sliced off a few dollars to bring it down to $75.\r\n \nRead more",

These are the folks behind NieR: Automata and Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, after all, and now they’re making a live-service, co-op slasher. Sign. Me. Up.\nAs it stands, the closed beta only showed a very small, very early build of the game, but we’ve got some thoughts.

An owl screeches and it scares the bejeezus out of me.\nYeah, it’s nice out here. But getting into the village by car is a challenge. The roads are wobbly and narrow, with little patience for noisy machines. This means I’ve had to stop and let other cars pass a lot. At first it was irritating, but now I’ve come to enjoy it. Getting a wave or a flash of the lights warms the heart and can turn a bad day into a good one. It strikes me that multiplayer games lack this fleeting comradery, which is a shame.\nRead more",

          "description": "Amazon Studios are \"nearing a deal\" to develop a TV series based on Mass Effect, according to a recent Deadline report. Excellent stuff. I'm all for it! If Mass Effect were to be adapted into anything, I'd much rather it be a potentially long-running series rather than a film so it has enough time to establish its excellent sci-fi setting. However, we need to talk about what story Amazon could potentially take from the games. To me, it seems likely they'd follow the trilogy, which I reckon is the right move. But I don't think we need to see more of Shepard's side of things, you know? They should put Liara front-and-centre instead.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Short of outright calling your game \"War\", Men Of War is about as generic a title as you can get for a video game. And I think this was at least partly reflective of the games behind it. Men Of War has generally delivered dependable real-time tactics games, but the series has never excited me in the way that, say, Relic's Company Of Heroes does.\nSo it's a promising sign that, at the end of Best Way's demonstration of the just-announced Men Of War II, I came away keen to play it. Not only does it look slicker and more user friendly than earlier games (without compromising on the depth that appeals to the series' core fanbase) there are a couple of ideas it’s playing with that lodged themselves in my mind like chunks of grenade shrapnel.\nRead more",

It’s no act of Capone-worthy self-mythologising, then, when game director Brenda Romero describes the patch list to me as “monstrous”. \r\n\n\r\n“Once we put out the immediate flames, we prioritised feedback,” says Romero “Chris [King, senior systems designer]'s hair was fully black when we launched this game. It’s all gone fully grey. I think we were awesome on launch. Incredibly responsive.

          "description": "I’ve spent some more time with FPS Battlefield 2042, having freed myself from EA’s vice grip. And it’s safe to say the fields of battle have taken on a vastly different complexion now it’s largely in the hands of many more players. Compared to my three-night imprisonment alongside other journos and influencers, my feelings have definitely levelled out.\nThe honeymoon period is over, basically. My relationship with the game in the real world, outside of EAs strict boundaries has lessened. I’m sorry to say it, but we’ve grown apart. Things are average between us, and perhaps only Portal, the game’s custom mode creator, can salvage things.\nRead more",

          "description": "Arkane's sneak-o-shooter Deathloop is a good game, but maybe not quite as stealthy as you might expect from the studio behind Dishonored. Even our Deathloop review said \"stealth is just the thing that goes wrong before a good fight\". Well, you might want to be a bit sneakier now, as the game's second major update has arrived and it makes NPCs a fair bit smarter. The patch addresses some common complaints about the PvP Invasion mode too.\nRead more",

          "description": "Within 60 seconds I was dead and laughing. Halo Infinite's multiplayer is a finely tuned mechanism for delivering explosions and dopamine. Developers 343 Industries did whatever the opposite of a jumpscare is this week, delighting deathmatch dilly-dalliers with a surprise release of their classical arena shooter. It's a beta, they insist. But we all know it's the proper game because they've had their betas already (excuse me, \"flights\"). \nAlso, look, this thing is impeccable. Clean, powerful shots trace across immaculate skyboxes, straight into the shining dome of your armoured clunkperson, with a frightening thud that is satisfying even in death. There are problems, of course, but most reside outside the actual shootouts, which are frenetic, zappy confrontations longtime Halo players will savour. \nRead more",

And it turns out that just like in 2019, your collective favourite gaming mouse is the Logitech G502. Truly, a timeless classic of clicks and scrolls.\r\n\n\r\nOf course, the G502 has come in a few different flavours, but you can now get one of the most recent models at the lowest price it’s ever been (at least in the UK). Amazon has the Logitech G502 SE Hero for £34: an entire pound less than the standard G502 Hero has ever dipped to, most recently during Prime Day 2021. \r\n\n\r\nUS denizens aren’t missing out either, as the G502 SE Hero is $33 at Best Buy in their own Black Friday sale. That’s not quite as cheap as its all-time low of $28, but its still a very good price on a very good mouse. The G502 SE Hero is essentially the classic G502 Hero with some white go-faster stripes – there’s been no funny business making adverse changes to keep the costs down. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim, the sci-fi strategy adventure game by Vanillaware (makers of Odin Sphere and Dragon’s Crown), is making its way to Switch on April 12. The game has only been available on PlayStation 4 since it launched in March 2020. \nThe game blends side-scrolling visual novel adventure with real-time strategy. Players control 13 ordinary high school students who also pilot giant mech suits called Sentinels. Okay, so they’re not that ordinary. The story primarily revolves around stopping an invasion, but the sci-fi tale branches in all sorts of wacky directions, many of which draw inspiration from stories like War of the Worlds and The Terminator. While you’ll use your mech to defend the world in RTS battles, the real meat of 13 Sentinels is navigating the intertwining, non-linear narratives of the students. Each teenager has their own story arc, and you’ll jump back and forth between them all to uncover the entire bonkers storyline. Take a look at the Switch announcement trailer below for an idea of what to expect. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nIn our review of the PS4 version, we scored 13: Sentinels an 8 out of 10, with former GI editor Joe Juba describing it as a “fun and ambitious experience that combines high-school drama and huge robots in a (mostly) beautiful package.” You can read our full review here.\nHave you been holding out hope for 13: Sentinels: Aegis Rim to come to Switch?

          "description": "With Spider-Man: No Way Home set to release in just a few weeks, Sony producer Amy Pascal has revealed that we’ll be seeing more of Tom Holland’s Spider-Man. \nPascal said No Way Home is not the last Spider-Man movie Sony Pictures Entertainment is making with Marvel Studios in a new interview with Fandango. She also revealed that Holland’s next movie will be the first in a new trilogy. \n“This is not the last movie that we are going to make with Marvel – [this is not] the last Spider-Man movie,” Pascal told Fandango. “We are getting ready to make the next Spider-Man movie with Tom Holland and Marvel. We’re thinking of this as three films, and now we’re going to go onto the next three. This is not the last of our MCU movies.” \nAs you can see in Pascal’s quote above, Holland’s Spider-Man will be seen in at least one more Spider-Man movie. He could also appear in the following two movies, but that’s not guaranteed considering Pascal didn’t specifically say Holland will be in all three. Perhaps he appears in the first of this new trilogy and then hands off the title to someone like Miles Morales. Perhaps he remains Spider-Man in all three films of the new trilogy. \nNews of a new Spider-Man trilogy from Sony and Marvel is exciting, particularly because Holland is set to star in at least the first one. Some online have speculated that Holland would be meeting his demise in No Way Home based on trailers and footage released for the film so far. It would seem that’s not the case, though. \nAlongside today’s news, three new No Way Home posters were released as well. You can check out each of them below. \nClick image thumbnails to view larger version\n \n                                                                                                             \n\nSpider-Man: No Way Home will hit theaters on December 17.

One important aspect of the entire discourse surrounding the multiplayer progression is that the game is still technically in beta. \nYes, 343 Industries is selling a battle pass that costs real money in it and it’s fair to want that battle pass to feel fair, but this beta period for multiplayer was likely enacted for this very reason: to get a feel of the community’s thoughts on it and progression, and make changes based on those feelings ahead of the full December 8 launch. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nOnly time will tell what changes we see come to Infinite’s multiplayer. For now, read about how 343 is investigating Halo Infinite’s battle pass progression and then check out this breakdown of the recent changes made to it.

However, this time, players will be suiting up as created Marvel superheroes and (potentially) supervillains. The new Marvel MMO is currently in development, but the unexpected announcement is exciting nonetheless. \nAccording to the slide entitled \"Exciting Product Slate for 2022 and Beyond,\" Dimensional Ink Studios is coming off a solid year with DCUO cornering the market for successful superhero-based MMOs. The studios' most popular title is celebrating its 10th anniversary and \"performing near its peak historical annual revenues.\" Under the \"medium-term\" banner (seen above), a graphics overhaul and massive content expansion are in the works and slated for a 2023 release. \nHowever, under the \"longer-term\" banner, an unannounced MMORPG is underway. The important bullet points read as follows:\nMarvel IP based massively multiplayer online game\nBeing developed by Dimensional Ink Studios in Austin, TX\nLed by Jack Emmert, who designed and helmed City of Heroes, and currently leads DCUO\nIt'll probably be a long time before we get any notable info about this new Marvel MMORPG. Still, based on Dimensional Ink Studio's pedigree, we can expect to see fun customization options, beloved heroes and villains to interact with, and exciting leveling systems with raid scenarios. \nIn other news, a bunch of  games featuring beloved Marvel and DC characters are around the bend.

To put it bluntly, the genre is struggling, and even the new console generation hasn’t been the answer to rejuvenating it. Take just this year, for example. Metacritic scores are anything but impressive for the biggest sports around. Madden NFL 22 earned an abysmal 60, NHL 22, which promised to change its metagame, disappointed with a 74. NBA 2K has largely been the franchise to beat, but NBA 2K22 only holds a 76, some of the lowest marks the series has seen in years.

After eleasing the 2D Zelda-inspired Hyper Light Drifter in 2016 to critical acclaim, fans of the game clamored to see what was next and many were surprised to see something totally different. Solar Ash is bigger and bolder than Hyper Light Drifter in every way, from its switch to a fully 3D world to its new emphasis on high-speed traversal over combat-focused dungeon crawling. But what is Solar Ash? Heart Machine’s creative director, Alx Preston, took us through a tour of the game to discuss its origins, gameplay, and how he is coping with the fear of the sophomore slump.\nIn Preston’s words the “stupid elevator pitch” for Solar Ash is Super Mario Galaxy meets Shadow of the Colossus.

Friends can get together 30 minutes before the event begins.

This week, 343 Industries introduced the game's first limited event called Facture: Tenrai.\nFrom now until November 30, players can make progress on a new 30-tier battle pass, with the ultimate goal of unlocking a complete set of Yoroi Armor. The Tenrai battle pass is free, and although it isn't here for long, 343 Industries states that it will return at future dates, starting again in January. All progress made on the battle pass now will carry over when it returns.\nMost unlocks on this new battle pass come after gaining experience by completing challenges in the limited-time game mode: Fiesta. This 4-versus-4 skirmish gives random weapons to every player each time they spawn. Rockets, swords, and sniper rifles are all a part of the mix.\nOn top of this event, 343 Industries has set 10 a.m. PT as the weekly date that Halo Infinite's shop is restocked with new gear. This week, players can purchase the Chonmage Armor set (for 2,000 credits, which is roughly $17.99). Along with the samurai-like armor, this bundle includes the Thorn Diver legendary stance, Sundown Smile epic armor coating, and the Chonmage epic helmet.\nOther items in the shop include the Sentinel's Blade legendary utility, which comes with the Sentinel epic nameplate and emblem. If you want your weapons to have a little more style, the Shinobi Wrap decal is available, and gives your weapon a lilac-steel color, along with a Shinobi wrap model and a Shuriken charm. The last item available this week is the Six Date Loyalty bundle, consisting of the Noble Loyalty epic armor coating and two sixth gate shoulder pads. You can see all of the offers below:",

Other than that, details are scant other than Harmonix games like Rock Bank will continue to stay up and running, though expect the developer to leverage its talents in Fortnite sometime in the future musical talents as well.\nEpic has, of course, been dipping its toes into interactive concerts and musical performances in recent years, and that trend will undoubtedly continue and expand with a team like Harmonix under its umbrella. If any team can top what Epic has done with experiences like last summer's Ariana Grande performance, Harmonix would be the group to do it. \nDoes this make you hopeful for more dedicated music games, or are you potentially excited for more rhythm content in Fortnite? Give us your thoughts on the Harmonix acquisition in the comments below.",

In those eight weeks, the conversation around this choice has focused on the accent of the famous plumber. Will he be doing the traditional Mario accent, or will he do something else?\nIn a new interview with TooFab, Mario movie co-producer Chris Meledandri has defended Pratt’s casting, calling his voice for Mario phenomenal. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\n“All I can tell you is the voice that he’s doing for us, and Mario, is phenomenal,” Meledandri told TooFab. “Yeah, I can’t wait for people to hear it.”\nTooFab asked the producer about the decision to cast Pratt, someone who isn’t Italian, as the Italian plumber. Meledandri said he’s an Italian American and understands some of the feelings people have over the casting choice. He said Charlie Day, who is Italian, being cast as Luigi, is this movie’s nod to the Italian background of the famous plumber duo. \nHowever, Meledandri adds that you can expect the Mario movie to touch on the Italian accent, or rather, lack thereof. \n“We cover it in the movie,” he said. “So, you’ll see we definitely nod to that.” \nMeledandri also said that you should not expect Pratt’s performance to lean too much into the “It’s a-me, Mario!” side of the character, popularized by Charles Martinet, who’s been the voice of Mario for decades. \nWhile waiting to hear Pratt’s Mario, check out the full cast list for Illumination’s Mario movie.\n[Source: TooFab]\nWhat do you hope Pratt’s Mario sounds like?

There’s the limited edition Adidas shoes, the fancy Halo Xbox Series X, and more. Now, there’s a digital Xbox museum you can peruse through, too. \nGetting there is quite simple – head to museum.xbox.com. We highly recommend signing in because doing so will create a museum space unique to you that features information about your history with Xbox as a brand, your achievements, and more. That’s not all, though. Within the museum are multiple other sections for your metaverse-like avatar to visit: the original Xbox, the Xbox 360, the Xbox One, the Xbox Series X/S, and a Halo section. \nAs you walk through each museum section using your keyboard, you can place your 3D avatar into yellow circles on the ground. These circles are found in front of museum exhibits and once in the circle, you can interact with the exhibit to learn more. For example, in the original Xbox space, there’s a circle in front of an exhibit with the title “Bill Gates and The Rock join forces to unveil Xbox.” Upon interacting with this exhibit, you’ll be taken to an interactable story that features information about this unveiling, a video of the event, and more. \nThat’s what each of the digital exhibits is like, too, and it seems like making your way through the entire museum would take hours. It’s quite an expansive lineup of information, not to mention it features your own personal history with Xbox in a section as well. \nHead to museum.xbox.com to tour through the exhibit yourself and then catch up on some of Game Informer’s Halo Infinite coverage – it’s Halo’s 20th birthday too this year, after all. After that, check out these Xbox 360 Adidas sneakers and then take a look at this new Halo Xbox Elite controller. \nWhat’s your favorite Xbox memory? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "When the PlayStation 5 was first revealed last year, the console design was polarizing. On one end of the spectrum, PlayStation fans were excited about the new futuristic, sleek look. In contrast, other consumers were not as impressed, namely in regards to the white faceplates. Once the next-gen console launched, third-party companies began producing different colored faceplates, with black being one of the most popular options on the market. Sony, for the most part, legally brought an end to those competitors. And now, the entertainment conglomerate has been granted its own patent for official PS5 faceplates. \nAccording to GameSpot, the patent is listed as a “Cover for Electronic Device” and comes paired with a few mock-up sketches of the PlayStation 5. The text within the patent claim mentions a “Skin cover for PS5 console” and “the ornamental design for a cover for an electronic device.” \nOf course, this doesn’t immediately equate to a future where Sony-labeled faceplates might be sold at your local electronic establishments. For all we know, nothing will come of this. But it’s nice to imagine a new look for the PlayStation 5. Only time will tell what this patent means for the console’s aesthetic. \nDo you think this is simply Sony cornering the market without the intention of actually releasing faceplates? Or are we going to see this patent put to use? Throw down your theories in the comments below! \n[Source: GameSpot]",

As reported by GameSpot, it’s not that Reeves isn’t a fan of Mortal Kombat – he just thinks John Wick and Neo don’t belong. \n“If it was up to me? No, Mortal Komat is awesome in so many ways, but I think...you know, Neo, John Wick, they’re doing their own thing,” Reeves told Esquire. “Mortal Kombat is doing their own thing.” \nLook, Reeves certainly knows these characters more than us Internet folks who want to see Neo lean back to dodge Scorpion’s infamous “get over here” chain attack, but c’mon, no to John Wick as well? That character is a trained assassin that has killed anyone in his way – surely Sub-Zero doesn’t stand a chance. \nRegardless, there might still be a chance despite what Reeves says. As noted by GameSpot, Mortal Kombat and its developer NetherRealm are owned by Warner Bros. which is the same company that owns The Matrix franchise...so the possibility is there. In fact, Game Informer reported in 2019 that series creator Ed Boon said NetherRealm was “pretty close” to adding Neo to Injustice 2. \nSpeaking of Injustice 2, check out our thoughts on the DC fighter in Game Informer’s Injustice 2 review and then read Game Informer’s Mortal Kombat 11 review.
