When he is eaten by a passing disco lizard or ravenous skull-faced vulture, it is because he is basically a delicious Squirmle existing in a horrifying cryptozoological ecosystem. He is, however, never stepped upon by a mech with a missile launcher. He is never given a shotgun and tasked with shooting the other animals. Yet that basically seems to be the elevator pitch for Uruc, a sci-fi metroidvania set in a distant future where strange life battles mechanical monstrosities. \nRead more",

          "description": "Almost a decade after his acrimonious departure from Konami, the shadow of Hideo Kojima still looms over Metal Gear Solid. He's there, barely camouflaged, in the undergrowth of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - a remake of the fifth Metal Gear game, originally released in 2004, which tells the tale of a lone US special operator hunting superweapons and old mentors in the jungles of the southern Soviet Union. \r\n\n\r\nI say \"remake\" but this feels more like a re-release, in spirit. True, it now runs on Unreal Engine, with the option of a manual, third-person perspective and cover-shooter controls in addition to the old top-down viewpoints. Yes, it boasts new flourishes, such as wounds now leaving scars, and clothes picking up stray leaves. Yes, there's a new interface with floating in-world menus, which makes shuffling between the layers a bit less awkward. It's the product of much labour, with development split between Konami and external support partner Virtuos. But where Konami's other big restoration project, Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake, is a creative dialogue with the original game, Delta seems consumed by faithfulness to Kojima's original design.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "One of my formative video game moments is the final mission of Psygnosis cyberpunk flight sim G-Police. (It came out in 1997, and as such, I think the statute of limitations on spoilers has passed, but if you still intend to play, stop reading now.) The mission completes the long arc of foreshadowing begun by the intro's mention that capital-class spacecraft have been outlawed, following a ruinous war. It turns out that one particular evil corpo has been sneakily building one of these megaships - not only that, but you get to fly inside it, cannons ablazing. It was while doing so that teenage me realised the true exceptionality of the Video Game Artform. You can't fly inside capital ships in, like, symbolist poems or baroque symphonies, can you? You can't fly in poems or symphonies at all, unless you do so metaphorically - \"metaphor\" being a kind of poor man's graphics card.\nThe technology of flight simming has advanced mightily since G-Police's day. For instance: in Everspace 2's just-announced Titans DLC, you get to fly inside not just regular old spaceships, but massive space kaiju with procedurally generated digestive systems. Here's the trailer.\nRead more",

You can, quite literally, go on tours curated by historians around each of the game's respective maps. Instead of diving off a Sphinx and plunging your hidden blade into someone's spinal column, you can look up at the Sphinx and read a paragraph on its significance. Maybe view an actual, real life bit of ancient Egypt from an actual real life museum collection in-game. Perhaps embody an Anglo-Saxon lad in Valhalla, instead, and like, cook up some nettle soup having just got a fresh \"Friar Tuck\" at the local hair choppers (no guarantees on this last bit).\nThis is all to say that Black Myth: Wukong deserves such a mode, too. There were so many times throughout my review time where I stopped and stared and wondered as to something's meaning. Not only in the architecture, but in the characters, too. So here I am with a proposition: how about instead of thwacking things with my staff, I can use it as a walking stick and point it at things I want to learn about.\nRead more",

The ultrawide functionality extends to cinematics - you can disable \"cinematic aspect ratios\" to switch off the black bars that otherwise hem in the view. It's one of several PC-specific flourishes they've just blogged about. Have a look.\n Read more",

In this case, it's the demo for Cupiclaw, which is possibly the first ever \"roguelike deckbuilding claw machine game\". You know how Balatro made you feel about Joker cards? Well, this game wants to make you feel the same about claw machines. It's a terrible turn of events, frankly. I'm sorry for inflicting yet another potential bingeplay upon you.

          "description": "Our James recently stormed off to Cologne after having one too many kills stolen by Edwin in Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. “I’m never even going to look at another videogame again!”, he declared. Unfortunately for James, he accidentally walked straight into Gamescom. “I’m starting to think that there are a lot of video games” he informed us yesterday. Horrifying if true. Still, it does sound like he’s managing to have some fun there, mainly by hitting up Saber Interactive COO and former id Software co-owner Tim Willits for some top tips on how to avenge Edwin’s thieving ways.\nTips about kill-stealing aside, James found time to ask Willits about Space Marine 2's microtransactions, and whether there was any nervousness returning to a cult hit series… especially one a lot of people had almost given up on ever seeing again. “Even the “push forward” combat of the original was part of [id’s] inspiration when we created Doom 2016,” answered Willits. “So for me personally, it’s this huge circle. It’s always intimidating working on a franchise that people love.” But, with the right team, technology, and vision he says, “it just comes together.”\nRead more",

So I was intrigued to give the alpha version of Splitgate 2 a go and see if it had a little more substance to it than its initial reveal, which gave off a, \"it's Splitgate but with more money\" feel. \nWell, I think it's… a bit serious? It certainly has more polish and some extra additions, yet I didn't come away from it thrilled by its more competitive, class-based FPS leanings.

I’m only tangentially familiar with the Dying Light games, but I was under the impression that the model here was releasing a single game, then updating and expanding it for years. Whether standalone adventure Dying Light: The Beast represents an attempt to course correct after Dying Light 2’s mixed reception, then, I’m not entirely sure. But if nothing else, it does share something in common with all the other adverts at Gamescom tonight: it is a game that exists, and will presumably be playable at some point.\n \nRead more",

Developed well over two decades ago, the original Silent Hill 2 is the magnum opus of Polish horror stalwarts Bloober Team. Running on then-innovative \"Unreal Engine 5\" technology created by Jazz Jackrabbit publishers Epic MegaGames, it's a wonderful abyss of a game that remains perfectly playable today, given a certain amount of tolerance for the quirks of the era.\nIt begins with your character, James Sunderland, descending from the road towards the eponymous Midwestern nowhere-town. Like many games of the period, Silent Hill 2 uses a third-person, over-the-shoulder manual camera, which allows you to glance fearfully up at the monstrous pine trees that fringe the path - each rising from a bulging tide of fog that menaces with the suggestion of approaching figures. There is moisture everywhere, gushing from drain pipes and dribbling down concrete barriers. As you amble into the murk, deathly chords and groaning, unmechanical motifs reverberate from somewhere deep underground. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "When Bloober and Konami announced that they were remaking Silent Hill 2 as part of a comprehensive series reboot, it made immediate if slightly deflating sense to me. Silent Hill 2 is the more feted of the Hills - if I were a calculating franchise custodian tasked with 'bringing back' one of the acclaimed original trilogy, that's probably the instalment I and my spreadsheets would fix upon. I mean, it's the game with Pyramid Head in it - the nearest thing Silent Hill has to a mascot, and it's not like there's an issue of cutting out plot material: each game in the Silent Hill series is, on some level, a distinct story with a distinct protagonist.\nStill, the decision to 'skip' the first game in the series, whose world, narrative themes, music and art direction set the parameters for all the rest, made my brain itch a bit, and when I ran into Bloober's creative director Mateusz Lenart and lead producer Maciej Głomb at a Konami event, I had to ask about it. \r\n \nRead more",

If I don't love it, I don't swallow.\nAh, you needn't worry. This is by far the most fun I've had reviewing a game, and Shapez 2 has, in my mind at least, turned the holy trinity of factory games (Factorio, Satisfactory, Dyson Sphere Program) into a holy quartet. Its pared back, everything-is-free-forever approach is quite liberating, and I've never had so much fun placing conveyor belts in my life. But 40 hours into my save file, I've often found myself yearning for a bit more creativity in the challenges, a few more curveballs sent in my direction.\n Read more",

Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s October 31st release date leaked earlier, Steam have put together a Summer Fright Night bundle featuring RPS fave Hauntii, and I’ve got a strange urge to gorge on Haribo and mini Double Deckers until blood comes out of my eyeballs. What a perfect time, then, to dive into the alpha demo for vampire management game Blood Bar Tycoon, especially since Two Point seem to be resting on their laurels a bit too comfortably for my liking.\nThe idea here is you build a swanky bar serving claret cosmopolitans, ichor-ish coffees and uh, viscera vampiros to your undead clientele. But (with the sorta exception of the crimson-sapped Dracaena cinnabari) blood doesn’t grow on trees, so you’ll also be moonlighting as a human-nabber. You’ll research a slew of “whacky contraptions” to extract their blood, which I greatly enjoy, because “zany exsanguination” is a real winner of a feature. You can’t frivolously phlebotomise with impunity, however - you’ll also want to be on the lookout for vampire hunters aka the fun police.\n \nRead more",

Unlike most Call of Duty features, this mechanic is a hidden gem in the various settings. So, if you're not sure where to find it, we'll guide you on how to edit a showcase in Modern Warfare 3.\n\n\nHow do you edit your showcase in MW3?\n\n\nTo find the 'Edit Showcase' feature in MW3, open the settings section at the top right corner of the CoD Hub.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHead to the tab with the emblem, next to Settings, where you'll find the option to personalize your showcase. Once open, you can tailor the display of your Operator, Weapon, Calling Card, Emblem, and Clan Tag to your liking.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nNot all content will be available, as some skins and cosmetics require a purchase or completed objective. For example, you must earn enough Operator Kills or win matches to earn the seasonal Prestige Mastery Cards.\n\n\nDisplay up to three Calling Cards in the showcase to cover your favorite achievements. However, once they are placed down, these cards cannot be manually removed from the slots. The only way to get rid of them is by swapping it out with another available Calling Card.\n\n\nYou can further tweak your Operator display via the Customize tab. You'll find this hub in MW3 Zombies or Multiplayer, providing access to purchased bundles, vehicles, loading screens, and music. Calling Cards, Emblems, and Clan Tags can also be personalized here for quick and easy access.\n\n\nOnce you've edited your showcase in Modern Warfare 3, your profile becomes a sight to behold for other players.

Turns out, Janky isn't actually at the quest waypoint the quest itself tells you to go to. Instead, Janky, along with Fourman Grimes, can be found in Gundargaz, The Ringing Deeps (/waypoint 48, 35), standing next to each other inside the building you kicked coal into earlier. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nWhy the quest marker points to a location in the Isle of Dorm is beyond me.

Ironically, once you've accepted Janky's quest, the original quest marker from Home Is Where the Candle Is, becomes accurate.

          "description": "If you're planning to level up your Alchemy in WoW: The War Within, then you're going to need a whole bunch of Coreway Catalyst for experiments. If you're new to the profession, then it's not exactly clear how you get the reagent, so here's everything you need to know.\n\n\nWhere to get Coreway Catalyst in WoW: The War Within\n\n\nAt the release of WoW: The War Within, there are two ways to obtain Coreway Catalyst, though one is off-limits to you if you're just starting out.\n\n\nThe first and primary method of obtaining it is by breaking down solutions you've already made or collected using the Neutralize Concoctions option in your Alchemy recipe list. Going this route will turn whatever alchemical creations you use as reagents into Coreway Catalyst for further experimentation. You'll need a lot of them for this process, so this is by far the most common way to get them.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can also specialize in the Thaumaturgy Alchemy tree and craft them yourself. With this method, once you've invested at least 15 points into the remaining Thaumaturgy tree, you'll have a chance to create Coreway Catalyst via any Thaumaturgy you attempt, including transmutation. Since this requires 15 points invested into the Thaumatugry tree, you won't be able to jump into Alchemy using this method. This one is for those who've already been working on the profession and are looking for other ways to obtain Coreway Catalyst.\n\n\nEventually, you'll have so many Coreway Catalysts that you won't know what to do with them all. In the meantime, though, these are the best ways to obtain the reagent without too much effort.\n\nThe post How to get Coreway Catalyst in WoW: The War Within appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you've been exploring Modern Warfare 3's Multiplayer maps, you may have stumbled upon the adorableness of the rubber duck collection. Although they are primarily just for show, Sledgehammer Games has hinted at a new Easter Egg, spawning a colossal-sized rubber duck for the world to see.\n\n\nIn the post, Sledgehammer Games offers a few hints, including the phrase, \"Two foes meet where photo frame a win.\" Call of Duty players were quick to decipher the puzzle, pointing toward the display in MW3 Season 5's Bait map. It wasn't long until they discovered the giant duck Easter Egg, as it spawns in the ocean nearby.\n\n\n\n\nEven though it's pretty easy to spot the photo frame display, a few other requirements are still needed. YouTuber DANNYonPC was one of the first to discover this, where they utilized the Operators Captain Price and Makarov. Considering their tumultuous history, the two characters correlate to the \"two foes\" hint mentioned earlier. You can then set yourself up for a picture-like shot by putting their faces inside the holes of the frame display, thus spawning little ducks to shoot.\n\n\nI never thought I would see Price and Makarov interact in such a friendly way, but it sure is a welcome surprise. And it gets even better when the big boy appears in the ocean to commemorate this unlikely duo. However, if you want to do it yourself (with another player), your team must quickly shoot the smaller ducks near the photo display to uncover the Easter Egg. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nMore Call of Duty Easter Eggs are undoubtedly in the works now that the Black Ops 6 beta is almost here. I, for one, am looking forward to the ones in the upcoming Zombies mode, which has been known for its monumental Easter Eggs. Who knows? Maybe it'll spawn in a giant zombie duck.\n\nThe post Sledgehammer Games teases giant rubber duck easter egg in Modern Warfare 3’s Bait map appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Once you find yourself in the Pagoda Realm in Black Myth: Wukong, you’ll notice Purple Seals on many of the jail cells. Locked behind those seals are rewards and NPCs worth the trouble of breaking into those cells.\n\n\nTo get the rewards waiting in those chests, here's how to break Purple Seals in Black Myth: Wukong. \n\n\nBreak the Purple Seals in Black Myth: Wukong\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nDo not worry about the seals until you reach the Upper Pagoda Shrine. Once here, there’s a boss right behind the  Captain Lotus-Vision shrine. It's quite an annoying fight since you have to deal with a lingering life-reduction mechanic. Because of this, it’s best to approach the Captain when the cycle resets.\n\n\nIt’s a straightforward fight, but the annoying part comes from the various dodging you have to do when it starts firing lasers. During most of its ranged attack phases, it’s hard to hit it, or you can’t hit it at all.\n\n\nMake sure you have a build that can quickly knock it down or learn to dodge the oncoming beams. Once you do, this will solve one of the two big annoyances of the Pagoda Realm area.\n\n\nHowever, if the boss fight is too much of a headache because of the health debuff, you can make your way to the very top of the area. Once you find the Mani Wheel Shrine, one of the main bosses, Captain Wise-Voice, is right ahead. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nAdmittedly, this fight can be a bit annoying, too, but defeating this one here will remove the debuff when exploring below.\n\n\nJust note that you may want to kill all nine of the Lantern Wardens before doing this so you won’t miss out on the rare Curio. If you defeat the boss at the Mani Wheel Shrine, the Wardens will no longer appear.\n\n\nOnce you do kill Lotus-Vision, you will have to re-explore the Pagoda Realm to fully complete your Chapter 3 Black Myth: Wukong run.\n\nThe post How to get rid of Purple Seals in Black Myth: Wukong appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Almost two years after Radiohead released 'In Rainbows' as a pay-what-you-like album, the track 'These Are My Twisted Words' leaked on private torrent site What.cd. Many believed that the band itself was responsible, something we highlighted in our August 2009 article. Coinciding almost perfectly with the leak's 15-year anniversary, a complaint filed with Google now claims that the report violates copyright law and must be permanently deindexed from search results.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

NVIDIA admittedly used pirated books to train these models, which triggered a copyright infringement lawsuit. This week, the company informed the court that these claims fall flat, arguing that copyrighted books are nothing more than statistical correlations to its AI models.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",
