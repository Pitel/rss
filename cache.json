A Void Hope certainly carries on some of the level design and exploration elements central to the studio’s previous releases, but here there’s much more focus on atmosphere, story, and horror. It doesn’t entirely stick the landing, but this is ultimately a worthwhile little project that we’d encourage you to consider.\nA Void Hope follows the tale of Keegan and Glinda, a couple in a rocky patch of their relationship who find themselves dealing with the fallout of a global pandemic. People all over are becoming infected and losing their memories, eventually devolving into zombie-like creatures that sometimes transform into something decidedly less human.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

If only there was a mod where we could see how ridiculous that would look in, say, Ocarina of Time, eh?\nSurprise! There is one! Modder notCHase has managed to recreate the handy building feature in the PC port of Ocarina of Time and the results are... kind of hilarious, if we're honest (thanks, Gaming Reinvented). Yes, the functions are a tad more basic than that which we find in TOTK (don't be expecting to see any Mechs), but, hey, it works.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "When we first meet The Thaumaturge's hero Wiktor Szulski, we're told he's a man cursed by the vice of pride. It's a trait that sits at the heart of his personality, and in this particular alt-history telling of Polish turmoil in Warsaw at the turn of the twentieth century, such 'Flaws' can also attract the attention of otherworldly beings called Salutors - vicious creatures of myth and folklore who follow their quarry around like dark and gloomy shadows, amplifying their worst qualities and, in many cases, driving them to emotional, and often violent, extremes. It's these outbursts that Wiktor will be investigating over the course of this curious detective RPG from the makers of Seven: The Days Long Gone and the upcoming The Witcher 1 Remake, as fortunately for him, Wiktor comes from a long line of storied Salutor tamers, his thaumaturgic know-how allowing him to see these monsters made flesh, exorcise them from their human host, and use them for his own gains.\nHe's a man that's ultimately made peace with his own arrogance, then, but considering everything he goes through during The Thaumaturge's 25 hour-odd run-time, I reckon his pride is pretty justified. Not only is he able to brush off multiple stab and gunshot wounds and clubs to the face when he gets in a fight, but he also achieves several feats of thaumaturgy that we're repeatedly told are thought to be nigh on impossible. Indeed, at the start of this game, his connection with his original Salutor Upyr is hanging by a thread, his worst instincts having got the best of him in a recent attempt to tame and capture a second beast from the ether. By the end, however, I had six Salutors at my beck and call, out of a total of eight. Wiktor is very much a force to be reckoned with, and he makes for a highly compelling lead as you navigate the branching storylines in Warsaw's political hotbed.\nRead more",

There's a meteor scheduled to slamdunk the planet in 30 days, and in that time, you and your fellow players must progress from raising log cabins in the woods to building the means to develop technologies that might somehow avert the apocalypse. The trouble is, pioneering said apocalypse-averting technologies might itself bring about disaster in a gameworld that simulates things like habitat death, species extinction, air pollution and catastrophic flooding. \r\n\n\r\nPlayers must thus walk a careful line between resource exploitation and self-inflicted calamity by monitoring their impact on the overall simulation, founding the right kind of government, and passing laws or devising economies (including player-created currencies) that don't flip the ecosystem upside down. The Steam reviews teem with anecdotes about people waking up to find their oil wells underwater, and it sounds like things will only get knottier when Eco releases out of early access around the end of this year.\r\n\n \nRead more",

On my most intense plunge into one cave, I groaned aloud as the path I was praying must be the exit twisted back on itself, sending me first down a rope, and then into a long slide down, down into the earth, back into the spindly clutches of pale, bifurcated mutants. When I finally saw the sun again, I could have cried.\nIt’s still a bit wonky, but the full 1.0 release makes the Forest a fuller, livelier and more inviting (or else alluringly off-putting) prospect for a wander - even, as in my case, a wholly solo one.

He and his fellow co-founder Ben Driscoll had just spent a week playing Daniel Mullins' mysterious roguelike deckbuilder Inscryption at the end of October 2021, but the combination of a bad storm and a power outage ended up forcing Guerra to decamp from his home in Massachusetts and stay with some family until it all blew over. \"I got back late on Halloween, just in time to put out a bowl of candy for some kids, and then the next morning we started Cobalt Core,\" he tells me.\nThe pair had been working on a range of different prototypes in the months leading up to this lightbulb moment. As development on their debut game, the spaceship building puzzler Sunshine Heavy Industries, began winding down, \"we were throwing all kinds of stuff at the wall,\" he says, including games in 3D, a platformer, with Driscoll revealing they even had \"a Terraria-like one for a couple of weeks\" with a grid-based world that characters bounced around in. But it was playing Inscryption that brought everything to a head. Both had spent hundreds of hours with Slay The Spire, but \"Inscryption proved to us that there was still a lot of space to explore in the genre,\" says Guerra. And with increasing calls from Sunshine Heavy Industries players begging them to let them fly the ships they were creating in its shipyard sandbox, \"you can kind of see how that went from A to B\".\nRead more",

Yesterday, when he announced to everyone at EA that a bunch of them were losing their jobs (again), he first spent three paragraphs talking about how EA is doing great, leading the industry, getting increasing engagement from fans, optimising their global footprint and sunsetting games oh yep, there it is, that's the \"you're about to be unemployed\" language right there. The company is moving away from \"the development of future licensed IP\" and toward \"our owned IP, sports, and massive online communities\".

          "description": "Could there be a more than universally relatable quote shared by indie developers than: \"We really just wanted to make a small game\"? Of course, there's little to complain about when games like Cuphead or Owlboy finally see the light of the day, demonstrating what wonders growing ambition can often bring.\nHaving said that, I’m not entirely surprised that Vladimir Semenets, the lead game designer of Militsioner, sits in front of me on Zoom and tells me how they initially envisioned a six-month project, \"something very fast\". Yet, here we are, three years and more than a dozen developer vlogs since TallBoys' surreal runaway sim first captured everyone's attention (including one state-owned Russian news channel). If not for its Kafkaesque premise, which pits players against a ten-story tall looming policeman in a quest to escape a small town, then definitely because of the game’s ambitious voice recognition feature that promised real-time conversation instead of pre-written dialogue.\nRead more",

The game is a series of long, annoying journeys, during which the most fun I had was turning my head to watch Catfish on my other monitor.

          "description": "A long time ago on a desktop far, far away, my family once owned a demo disc for the original Star Wars: Dark Forces. I cannot remember for the life of me which level(s) it contained. My only surviving memory of it is having quite a good time blasting Stormtroopers and the chaps in black with the swoopy, knock-off Vader helmets, but also getting terribly lost and not really knowing what the heck I was meant to be doing. Now, playing Nightdive Studio's Star Wars: Dark Forces Remaster as an adult probably close to three decades later, both these feelings have come roaring back, as this is very much a Star Wars FPS in the vein of Doom and other early 90s shooters (thumbs up). But it's one that leans so hard into its maze-like level design that it can regularly feel like a little bit of a tough hang in the cold hard light of 2024 (thumbs down).\nCrucially, though, not to the point where it's best left consigned to the history books. This is still an enjoyable and worthwhile artefact in Star Wars' PC gaming history, and if your eyes (and general patience levels) can't quite stomach the 'Classic' and still available 1995 original, then this remaster is a pin-sharp glow-up for modern hardware.\nRead more",

          "description": "Eric \"ConcernedApe\" Barone has marked the 8th birthday of his farming sim phenomenon baby (also called Stardew Valley) by announcing the impending release of update 1.6. The PC version - the one we care about - is arriving on the 19th of March, and consoles and mobile as soon as possible after that. The actual content of update 1.6 is largely a mystery, but Barone has teased a few things here and there, including that it's \"mostly changers for modders\" that'll make it \"easier and more powerful to mod\". \nRead more",

A couple of weeks ago, it was \"I refuse to leave the prologue area in Skull And Bones\", a decision that has sadly been born out by Ed's review. Then it was \"I refuse to play Helldivers 2 as a co-op shooter\", which again, is a stance I am sticking with, even as I am overrun and sat on by Terminid Chargers. And now it's \"I refuse to play Cobalt Core as a roguelike deck-builder, because it secretly isn't one\". Come now, squint at the header image so that the text and numbers fade away, and all you can see are coloured shapes. Pay attention to certain underlying rhythms while playing.

I thought that it should not have been marketed as main game DLC instalment when it pivoted to being a magical girl dating sim. This serves to show how unrealistic dreams can be; in my waking hours I am, of course, of the clear-eyed awareness that a magical girl dating sim is entirely in-keeping with the rest of the Dragon Age oeuvre.\nI'm worried about Dragon Age. I'm worried that so much cost has been sunk, team members changed and redrafting did that it'll end up kind of a mess. But that's the pessimism talking. What I'd like to propose is that all the big game companies have a crack at something similar to Amazon's (hiliarious and abortive) attempt to officially license fan fiction, which was called Kindle Worlds.\nRead more",

          "description": "“Ever since the very first Yakuza on PS2, the Like A Dragon series has always tried to capture the cultural zeitgeist of Japan, reflecting and satirising whatever’s trending around when the game comes out. This means that the way people speak in Like A Dragon is constantly evolving to match the times,” says Dan Sunstrum, senior translator at Ryu Ga Gotoku’s localisation team. Keeping things current is, says Sunstrum, “a challenge in some ways but also means we’re justified in using modern English slang to match, whereas such modernisms might feel out of place in a game set in a completely fictional world.”\nSunstrum uses an example from the studio’s latest, RPS Bestest Best winning RPG Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, where permed protagonist Ichiban Kasuga meets a dating app designer. “The app’s creator goes on a mini-rant about ungrateful, entitled users, complaining how when anything goes wrong they’re quick to demand wabi-ishi,” slang for free premium currency. “This would have been a tricky word to localise, but it was made easy by the fact that fans of gacha games had already done it for us: they refer to them as ‘apologems’, and that’s what we ended up using in the game.”\nRead more",

          "description": "Sometimes I wonder whether every genre fantasy RPG or RPG-inflected game is essentially a journey towards the Big City. Most such games start you off on the periphery of the world, out in the sleepy and/or brutish hamlets of FirstActShire, Chosen One County, and send you on a loose quest towards the cosmopolitan centre, where you'll typically learn about the ultimate villain of the piece, gain access to the juiciest concentration of shops, crafting facilities and quest-givers, and glean some hint at the location of the endgame dungeon. Sometimes the quest takes days of playtime, as in Baldur's Gate 3. Sometimes it takes less than an hour, as in the original Destiny. It's a common-enough device that when an RPG starts you off in the Big City, like Dragon Age 2, or creatively \"provincialises\" the Big City, like Roadwarden, I feel slightly unnerved. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Attempt to tele-portal between realities on the Steam Deck, for instance, and you may find yourself trapped in the Stygian void, naught but a frozen loading screen tip for company and suspended hopelessly for all eternity. Or until you hold down the power button.\nThis crashing tendency alone means that while Nightingale can technically run on the Steam Deck, even without resorting to rock-bottom graphics settings, the current early access build isn’t yet ready for regular handheld play. That’s nothing developers Inflexion Games won’t tell you themselves – they’re \"not considering [the Deck] officially supported at launch,\" after all – but if you were thinking of giving this gaslamp fantasy survival sim a portable whirl, you might want to let that call to adventure go unanswered.\nRead more",

I sternly and sorrowfully turned my back on such hit releases as Shadow of the Colossus, Far Cry and yes, even, that PC gaming essential Half-Life 2, so as to spend 11-hour days boning up on Aeschylus and Samuel Johnson. Then, two weeks before my final exams, I somehow went out and bought Ensemble's Age Of Mythology.\nI'm not sure why - blame the devil on my shoulder, I guess. It wasn't even a new release at that point. I managed to get good marks in the exams despite several nights of binge-playing, but what direction, in general, would my life have taken if I hadn't bought Age Of Mythology at such a fateful hour? Better or worse? Could I have been some kind of billionaire don with a Pulitzer by now, if it weren't for Age Of Mythology? These things keep me awake at night. Anyway, here's a little more info about the forthcoming reboot Age of Mythology: Retold, which broadly aims to turn this wrinkled titan of the strategy genre into a proper modern esport.\n Read more",

          "description": "Denis Villeneuve's Dune: Part Two film wormed its way through theaters over the weekend, and if you've still got sand in the brain, there's plenty more where that came from. Namely, Funcom shared a closer look at the upcoming Dune: Awakening survival game, which is in the works for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.\n\n\nTo bridge the gap more elegantly, let's start with the \"Creating Worlds, from Book to Film to Game\" developer diary. This one has Funcom CCO Joel Bylos and Oscar-winning cinematographer Greig Fraser (Dune: Part One and Two, Rogue One) talking about what it takes to adapt something like Frank Herbert's classic novels. Dune: Awakening is ostensibly a survival/crafting game at its core, but those traditional survival elements eventually evolve from physical to political. See where the inspirations came from and how they expanded upon the world depicted in the film adaptation below.\n\n\n\n\nThe timing of Dune: Awakening's production seems to have paid off, particularly in the way they were able to visit the actual sets from the film in an effort to bring the world to life more accurately. The new tech utilized in Unreal Engine 5 certainly didn't hurt either, and it's cool to see how it also helped in previsualization for the films. \n\n\nFor another look at what all that work is building up to, you can see some cinematics and gameplay in the new trailer.\n\n\n\n\nHow well Dune works in the open world survival genre remains to be seen. As for when we'll be able to run for our dear lives from every Sandworm rumbling beneath the surface, that also remains to be seen. There's no release date in place for Dune: Awakening just yet, but hopefully, we'll know more soon. \n\nThe post Your chaser for Dune: Part Two is a new look at the Dune: Awakening survival game appeared first on Destructoid.",

One significant collaboration coming to MW3 and Warzone is Warhammer 40K. You're probably familiar with the ultra-popular franchise; it's made its way from books and tabletop games to video games and more. Soon, WH40K will be appearing in Call of Duty.\n\n\nSpace Marines, Sisters of Battle, and Astra Militarum skins come to Call of Duty\n\n\nAccording to a tweet from the official Call of Duty account, skins inspired by the Warhammer 40,000 universe are coming to the game. Over the last few weeks since Season 2 launched, there have been leaks and hints about the collaboration coming soon. But this is the first official statement directly from the developers themselves. The tweet doesn't show details about what the characters look like in-game, just a small teaser image.\n\n\nMost likely, the Warhammer 40,000 collaboration will come as an in-store purchase. This means it'll be something like $20 or more, as most items in the CoD store are. Hopefully, it comes with all three character skins in one and maybe a few other small cosmetics or a gun camo to really beef up your Warhammer loadout.\n\n\nHints of what's to come\n\n\n\n\n\nNothing official was announced about the contents of the upcoming collaboration, but a few leaks have surfaced. The data miner who first leaked the collaboration tweeted this video of the character select screen, among others.\n\n\nThe Warhammer 40,000 x Call of Duty collaboration content should be coming soon as we're almost to the start of season two reloaded. March 6 looks like the official launch, which should bring other new content and these new skins to the store.\n\nThe post A Warhammer 40K crossover is coming to Call of Duty MW3 and Warzone appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you've been dreaming about another platform for the stylishly sleepy rhythm game Melatonin, there's no need to pinch yourself. Developer Half Asleep announced plans to bring its chill beats to PlayStation 5 on March 12, 2024. \n\n\nTrue to the name of the devs themselves, Melatonin is all about bridging that gap between our reality and the world of dreams. Naturally, the best way to do so is through the lens of a rhythm game, complete with an appropriately dreamlike color palette and audio and visual cues that get the beat across without relying on traditional genre overlays and indicators. If you haven't checked it out yet, you can see a quick sample in the PS5 trailer below.\n\n\n\n\nMelatonin launched on PC via Steam and Epic Games Store back in December 2023, with a Switch version following close behind. Rhythm game pros can up the challenge with hard mode, while those who just want to chill — which is understandable given the overall vibes of the game — can toggle various assist features to make it easier. There's a story mixed in with all that nice hand-drawn art, too, as you explore the protagonist's dreams and learn more about them in the process.\n\n\nIf you just want to make your own scenarios, there's also a level editor that lets you remix and mashup game stages. The PC version lets you use your own song files as long as you know their exact tempo, but it's not clear if the PS5 version offers the same suite of features. All we know about that part of the game is that it's billed as an \"easy-to-use\" tool, so we'll see how much of that holds true this time next week. In the meantime, you can just pop your headphones on and let the beat roll over you. \n\nThe post Dreamy rhythm game Melatonin hits PlayStation 5 on March 12 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Xbox has announced its next Partner Preview stream showcasing games from third-party publishers. The broadcast begins on March 6 at 10 AM PT/ 1 PM EST/ 7 PM GMT. \n\n\nThe 30-minute stream will include trailers from multiple publishers, such as Capcom, Nexon, and Electronic Arts. The event also offers a glimpse into future Game Pass entries, release dates, and exclusive behind-the-scenes looks. \n\n\n\n\nCapcom's Action Strategy game, Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, is among the titles scheduled for a gameplay-focused showing. It takes inspiration from other beloved Capcom games, like Okami and Shinsekai - Into the Depths. If you're an Xbox Game Pass user, Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess will be available on Day One. \n\n\nAs for EA, the Partner Preview showcases an inside look into Tales of Kenzera: Zau's combat and traversal. The single-player Metroidvania adventure explores the personal journey of actor Abubakar Salim after his father passed away. Based on his speech at the Game Awards, Tales of Kenzera: Zau is meant to challenge the harsh realities of grief, reclaiming the spirit of Zau's father.  \n\n\nNexon's The First Berserker: Khazan, an RPG Souls-like RPG, is also among those listed explicitly by Xbox Wire. The Xbox Partner Preview showcase will provide more information about the life of the playable character, General Khazan. The entry also adapts from the world of Nexon's Dungeon Fighter Online (NFO). \n\n\nThe three mentioned above are the only games we know about, but there will likely be more gameplay features to come. This includes more release announcements and reveals, similar to other recent events. Tune into Xbox's YouTube or Twitch channels on March 6 to see what other adventures await for the Partner Preview. \n\nThe post Xbox announces Partner Preview stream slated for this week appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It’s not unheard of for games to feature nods to other games and eagle eyed players of The Sims 4 have noticed a less-than-subtle reference to Final Fantasy XIV’s Shadowbringers expansion in the latest Sims 4 Stuff Pack, Crystal Creations. \n\n\nPlayers noticed this rather obvious (at least to those Simmers who play FFXIV) reference in the description of the Spire-Shaped Gemstone. If you hover over the gemstone, its description reads, “Your own mini crystal tower than an exarch would be proud of.”\n\n\nIt's a clear nod to a fan-favorite character, the Crystal Exarch, from Shadowbringers. That, and the actual crystal tower, the centre of everything in the First and the stage for A Realm Reborn's Alliance Raids. Plenty there worth commemorating in a precious stone given what the 24-man raid eventually built up to. \n\n\n\n\nThe Sims 4 has other FFXIV secrets, too\n\n\nIt’s not the first time that the Sims 4 devs have thrown FFXIV references into the game, either. In the Werewolves pack, one of the items carries the name “Racked Teak-a Greatshelves.” It's another nod to more landmarks from the MMO, The Rak’tika Greatwood, a Shadowbringers zone. \n\n\nMore recently, in the Growing Together Expansion Pack featured one item, a small board filled with childrens drawings, among a long list of others. The swatches of this particular piece feature various references to FFXIV moments, one particularly obvious one being an image of a long-tailed blue bird flying around the planets. If you know, you know. \n\n\nImage via Gryphi on YouTube\n\n\nThese references are clearly intentional and the Devs behind their inclusions are not quiet about their love for FFXIV. The dev responsible for the Racked Teak-a Greatshelves, SimGuruNova, has admitted in the past that they use far too many Fantasia. Importantly, though, they noted a preference to play as either Miqo’te or Au Ra during MSQ progress. There's something I can't blame them for. \n\nThe post The Sims 4 pays tribute to FFXIV again with cheeky nod to the Crystal Exarch appeared first on Destructoid.",

As per the recent livestream from Spiders, Greedfall 2 will pivot into relying more heavily on community feedback for future updates. \n\n\nAccording to Spiders' producer Reba Isber, the Greedfall community was eager to provide feedback on the original game via reviews and other means. This prompted the team to send out a survey that helped inform some of Greedfall 2's earliest design choices, but also helped the team conclude that they needed opinions from experienced players to realize the game's potential to the fullest.\n\n\n\"Greedfall 2 is certainly a much more ambitious game than the first one,\" said Isber, \"and so Early Access seemed like the r…",

          "description": "Benjamin Franklin once said that \"nothing is certain except death and taxes.\" Had he been alive today, he almost certainly would have said, \"oh, and the other certainty is people will keep modding Doom until the end of time.\" Quite the forward thinker. Anyway, here's id Software's iconic FPS running on a toothbrush.\n\n\nJust a few days ago, Twitter user atc1441 (thanks, Rock Paper Shotgun) uploaded a brief clip showing Doom running on a smart toothbrush. On the tiny screen of the Planck Mini, you can just about make the game out. The modder even goes as far as showing it being controlled by a mouse.\n\n\n\n\nIn a second tweet, we see they eventually managed to get it to run full-screen rather than in a small window. Now we can see the thing much clearer.\n\n\nFight demons...and tooth decay\n\n\nAccording to atc1441 – who says their biggest passion is to \"custom firmware on as many devices as possible\" (no way) – the toothbrush itself, \"contains an ESP32-C3 with 4MB Flash.\"\n\n\nUsing some additional downloads and a \"miniwad\" of Doom, they were able to compress the game down to the 4MB required for the flash. Hey presto: Doom on a toothbrush!\n\n\nI don't think I'll ever get bored of the ways people can modify id's influential shooter, either tinkering with the original or getting it to run on all manner of devices. Just have a look: Doom on a robotic lawnmower, in an audio spectrogram, on a pair of earrings! \n\n\nOne day we're going to reach the singularity and someone will boast how they got Doom to run inside Doom. Oh, wait.\n\nThe post Sink your teeth into a port of Doom playing on a smart toothbrush appeared first on Destructoid.",

But it's still doing pretty well for itself, and if you are carrying on with it, you may be interested in this pretty nifty mod for the PC version.\n\n\nAs spotted by DSO Gaming, you can now add a mini-map to the Palworld UI, thanks to user T3R3NC3B over on Nexus Mods. Seems like such a small addition to the game, but given that it shows the location of all pals, it could well be an essential download for a lot of people.\n\n\nImage via T3R3NC3B/Nexus Mods.\n\n\nHere are just some of the features that \"Paldar\" comes with:\n\n\n\nShows player world location\n\n\nShows all Pals around you\n\n\nShows fast travel points\n\n\nShows other players\n\n\nShows lifmunk effigies\n\n\nShows dungeons\n\n\nShows chests\n\n\nShows skillfruit trees\n\n\nShows rare/shiny pals (indicated with the sparkles overlaid on the pals icon)\n\n\nShows bosses on map\n\n\n\nProbably shows you where you left your keys as well\n\n\nIt also has a \"mega zoomed-out mode for easy navigation.\" As this is a work-in-progress, there are plans to also add in displays for death locations, player and NPC camps, the ability to hide the mini-map, and more. So keep an eye out for updates to this mod.\n\n\nT3R3NC3B says the download is compatible in both single-player and on dedicated servers, though \"only if installed on clients.\"\n\n\nWith version 0.1.5.1 coming out recently, Palworld continues to iron out some of the kinks. It's still in Early Access, after all. Developer Pocketpair also said the game achieved over 25 million players not long ago. It must be doing something right, then.

          "description": "Having turned 20 last year and being a dominant force in digital PC gaming, it's hard to imagine Steam got off to a rocky start when it launched in 2003. However, here we are, and the Valve service continues to reign supreme, as it reaches another concurrent player milestone.\n\n\nAccording to the latest figures from SteamDB, 34,649,583 players were using Steam over the weekend. To put that into perspective (not that it really needs it), Worldometer shows the population of the UK is over 67.8 million people. This means Steam's new record was roughly half of the UK populace.\n\n\nScreenshot via Destructoid.\n\n\nThis might partly because of the ongoing Dinos vs. Robots sale (as well as the many events that take place throughout the year), which ends today. Who knows, but it goes to prove that PC gaming in the modern era is showing no signs of slowing down.\n\n\nSome were twiddling their thumbs, though\n\n\nOkay, so 34.6 million is a staggering amount. However, of those, only (\"only\") 11.1 million were actually in-game, according to the breakdown below the graph. In total, the number equates to a 3.8% increase over February 2024. There. That's a little extra statistic for ya.\n\n\nOriginally built as a way for people to update Valve games over the internet, a lot of people struggled to adapt to the digital changes that were about to happen in gaming. As a result, Steam was not very popular during its early years.\n\n\nThat seems inconceivable these days what with how the industry operates. Nowadays, we probably couldn't imagine a world in which we can't instantly download a game or a much-needed patch, especially given the state some releases are in on launch day.\n\nThe post Steam set a new concurrent player record over the weekend appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "David Walters has announced on Twitter that his “new helicopter game from 1992,” Thunder Helix, is launching on Steam Early Access on March 21.\n\n\nI’ve been keeping an eye on Thunder Helix for a while now. It’s a helicopter combat game made in the style of early PC flight sims. The style emulates the fractal landscapes used in pre-polygonal flight games, and goes as far as using a 256 color completely with pixel stippling. Although, the store blurb says it can also run at 16-bit color.\n\n\nI didn’t play very many of those flight sims. I was a bit too young. I did play Dungeons & Dragons: Dragonstrike, and a friend once brought over A-10 Tank Killer. I can’t believe I remember that game.\n\n\n\n\nThunder Helix contains all the bells and whistles: multiple helicopters, day and night gameplay, a winch. Everything you could possibly want from helicopter flying. It also supports multiple control schemes, including flight joystick. Unfortunately, I think my Microsoft Sidewinder Precision 2 Joystick is packed up at my parents. I haven’t bought anything more modern.\n\n\nI’m pretty jazzed. I could technically install a DOS flight sim right now, but whenever I do, I usually just struggle to get the controls working for a while and get tired. Something with a modern backend sounds pretty rad right now.\n\n\nThunder Helix will be out on PC via Steam Early Access on March 21.\n\nThe post Early flight sim inspired Thunder Helix takes off into Early Access this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

The latest addition to the store, the Crescent Moon Mount, is a particularly awaited one. \n\n\nWe’ve known that this mount has been coming for a while and especially attentive players have noticed that it’s been included in the FFXIVCollect database for a few months. There had been speculation about whether this item would come in the form of a Seasonal Event reward, but those can now be laid to rest. \n\n\nThe mount is, as the name suggests, a Crescent Moon draped in white fabric that glows in the dark and while riding it, you’ll be accompanied by a small Lopporit who sits beside you. The music is typical of Online Store mounts, playing the Palace of the Dead theme, otherwise known as the ‘Merry Wanderer’s Waltz’, as you glide through the skies. \n\n\nThe description for the mount reads as follows:\n\n\n“Designed in the likeness of a crescent moon, this magicked gondola was being kept in storage in Sharlayan, where it was classified as a gift. While its origin is undisclosed, the automaton that accompanies the contraption offers a telling clue. The trail of sparkles left in your wake will make you feel as though you're truly playing among the stars...”\n\n\nThe Crescent Moon Mount costs 24 USD and is thankfully account-wide, which means that you’ll only have to purchase it once and you’ll be able to use it with all existing characters, as well as any that you create in the future.\n\nThe post Crescent Moon Mount now available in the FFXIV Online Store appeared first on Destructoid.",

The really curious bit is that Dying Light 2 has slowly been inching closer to the sort of experience the original game delivered back in 2015.\n\n\nNow, it’s immediately important to understand and appreciate the fact that Dying Light 2 certainly did improve upon the original game in many ways. Simply by virtue of its setting, it’s a more interesting and fully realized experience: something that paves its own way, though clumsily at times, stumbling across the rooftops, not unlike a zombie of sorts.\n\n\nCertainly, there’s a vision behind Dying Light 2. Here’s a game about a post-apocalyptic community of zombie pandemic survivors. Survivors who live on rooftops and parko…",

Yeah, even though it has flown a bit under the radar, a new Silent Hill movie based on the events of Silent Hill 2 has been in the works for a while, and I'm cautiously optimistic about it.\n\n\nI know that getting two re-tellings of Silent Hill 2 in such a short timespan will probably strike many as weird, but the good news here is that they've brought back Christophe Gans, the French director responsible for the original Silent Hill film — the one that kinda owns, not the awful 3D one.\n\n\n\n\nOn top of my belief that Gans is a talented director with a strong artistic vision, I also trust him to helm the project because, well, he's had a good influence on gaming even without knowing …",

It may not be as dramatic a tale as two broke programmers grinding in sweat and tears, day and night, to come up with an era-defining masterpiece, but that first game in 1997 is very different from the Bethesda shooter you know and adore today.\n\n\nIn many ways, Fallout was the brainchild of Tim Cain (Pillars of Eternity, The Outer Worlds) who worked on the initial concept for six months before getting the go-ahead from Interplay.

On top of revealing new titles and over a dozen trailers, we’ll learn more about the mechanics of Tales of Kenzera: Zau. The event will reveal new gameplay footage of Capcom’s mysterious action game Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, which was first announced last summer. We'll also learn more details of The First Berserker: Khazan, the single-player action RPG set in the Dungeon & Fighter (DNF) universe. Microsoft says this will be a “no frills” showcase, meaning it will consist of nothing but new trailers, new games, behind-the-scenes looks, and release date announcements. \nThe event will air at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET on various Xbox channels such as YouTube and Twitch.

The sequel to developer Spiders’ 2019 RPG Greedfall was first announced in 2022.\nPremiering during last week’s Nacon Connect event, the trailer shows off the game’s customizable protagonist, a captured native of the previous game's setting of Teer Fradee, three years before the events of the first Greedfall. Forcibly relocated to the colonists’ continent of Gacane, you must escape by any means necessary. Like the first game, that includes using force, diplomacy, or cunning to forge your own choice-driven journey on this unfamiliar continent. The game features several factions to join and/or battle with, along with companions, romance options, and a revamped combat system with players controlling four characters at once. \n\n\nSpiders says Greedfall 2 is far more ambitious in scope, so it has decided to launch the game in early access via Steam to gather valuable feedback from players. Spiders also shares this initial version of the game will feature the entire beginning of the game, and players can explore roughly a quarter of the game’s full content. The game will receive regular updates, but saves will not be compatible between these different updates. You can learn more about what Greefall 2 entails by watching the developer deep dive video below: \n\n\nOnce its early access period concludes, Greefall 2: The Dying World is slated to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

It blends real-time strategy with tower defense. Set in a world devastated by an event known as the Cataclismo, you must rebuild. During the day, this means you’ll gather resources to construct fortresses brick-by-brick in a Lego-like fashion, along with placing soldiers and traps. Once night arrives, waves of monsters assault your stronghold, and you must repel them.\n\n\nThe game boasts realistic physics simulations (e.g., your strongholds collapse in a realistic manner, including falling debris that can squash enemies), and you can upgrade your fortress with improved building elements, troops, and more. In addition to a 30-hour story-driven single-player campaign, Cataclismo features a creative mode, a wave-based survival mode, and a battle-focused skirmish mode. \nCataclismo launches on July 18 for PC, and has a free Steam demo available now.",

First revealed during last year’s Game Awards, the studio held a special livestream presentation where it revealed the game’s early access release date: April 18.\nNo Rest for the Wicked takes place in a dark medieval fantasy world where a deadly plague has befallen an island community, transforming citizens into monsters. You play a chosen warrior to fight against this blight. Combing elements of Diablo, Dark Souls, and even Animal Crossing, you’ll fight for survival while restoring the town of Sacrament. No Rest for the Wicked also happens to be Game Informer’s latest cover story.\nAlthough No Rest for the Wicked will be on Steam via Early Access for the foreseeable future, the game will come to consoles when it eventually launches into 1.0. Our digital cover story launches on March 5, and you can keep an eye out for exclusive features and videos in our cover story hub.",

It's the game adorning our upcoming issue of Game Informer, but before our exclusive details for that drop, hosts Wesley LeBlanc and Marcus Stewart previewed a pre-Early Access build of the game's opening hour or so. \nIn it, Wesley explores a medieval coast, gets slaughtered a few times by some tough opponents, saves a blacksmith in trouble, and takes on the game's first boss, all while the two discuss their overall thoughts on Moon's pivot to this new genre. \nCheck it out in the No Rest For The Wicked New Gameplay Today below: \n\n\nHead over to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

However, the game will still be available to play. \nPlayers who boot up the game have been greeted with a message, posted below, announcing that on March 4, Crash Team Rumble will get its last content drop. The game is not shutting down, though. The base experience will remain live and players will have access to a free 500-tier battle pass. This includes 104 new items from all content across Seasons 1 through 3 and all available event rewards. Developer Toys for Bob has also disabled Crash Coin purchases, and players can use any remaining coins to buy battle pass tier skips.\nCrash Team Rumble launched last year on June 20, meaning the game's support only lasted for roughly seven months. While it's nice that the game won't be disappearing for the time being (especially since it's quite fun), it's a bummer to see its support dry up so quickly. \nWe quite enjoyed Crash Team Rumble, scoring it an 8 out of 10 in our review. Writer Aron Garst writes, \"Crash Team Rumble's take on multiplayer platforming madness is unique, with enough depth to keep you on your toes after hours of gameplay. Those searching for a fresh take on the long-running series should give it a try.\" \n\n\nIn related news, Toys for Bob announced that it's splitting from Activision Blizzard to go independent and potentially partner with Microsoft.

We had a great time with it – read Game Informer's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth review here – and one of the many reasons we enjoyed our 80-plus hours playing is because of the various relationships within the game and Cloud's party. Whether you're Team Clerith or Team Clifa, or maybe Team Cloud XIII (is that a thing?), there's plenty that will leave you satisfied. \nChief among those things is the special date night that happens within the Gold Saucer. We won't spoil when it happens in the game, and we won't discuss it in detail here, but we do want to let you know that we spent dozens of hours maxing out our relationships with each party member. That means we were able to take part in all possible dates at the Gold Saucer, and we captured each for you to watch below. \nHere's Every Gold Saucer Date In Final Fantasy VII Rebirth\n\n\nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth review, and then check out our guide of the best side quests in the game.

Embracer is selling the developer to a group of private investors in a deal worth $500 million, a source told the publication. \nOnce the deal goes through, Saber Interactive will be a privately owned company and free from Embracer, which is behind layoffs spread throughout the past couple of years. Following the transaction, the studio will continue work on its Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake, which it took over as the developer after Aspyr Media was removed from it in 2022. \n\n\nBloomberg reports this sale is another effort of Embracer to cut costs alongside studio closures and layoffs after a planned $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group fell through in 2023. The publication writes one of its sources says the $500 million deal comes with the option for Saber Interactive to bring with it multiple Embracer subsidiaries as well. \nSaber Interactive is also working on the recently announced first-person Jurassic Park: Survival. \n[Source: Bloomberg]",

It will be set in an original universe. \nThis unannounced and untitled game will \"craft a more intimate and relatable experience while offering a fresh take on first-person gameplay,\" according to a press release. \nBulletFarm is taking a remote-first approach to game development but considers itself a triple-A studio headquartered in Los Angeles, California. Joining Vonderhaar is the studio's creative director Chris Cowell. The studio is currently looking to hire in various roles to fill out the founding team. \n\n\"Starting this new studio has given me a chance to step out of my comfort zone and try my hand at making something entirely new and different,\" Vonderhaar writes in a press release. \"This is a departure from the games I've worked on, but one that showcases my passion for rich characters, precise mechanics, more intimate storytelling, and plenty of action. NetEase has provided us an incredible support structure to explore these new avenues and allow true freedom to begin building the concept and ideas for our game.\" \nNetEase president of global investments and partnerships Simon Zhu says the company is fully dedicated to giving BulletFarm the resources and support it requires to build its new first-person experience. \"David's leadership and the early collection of game development talent assembled at the studio is set to offer something truly unique for his existing fans along with a new audience.\" \nBulletFarm is currently developing its first title, but there's no word on when to expect to see it. \nWhat kind of game do you hope BulletFarm makes?

          "description": "A massive sweep of layoffs has rocked various Sony first-party studios today, including Naughty Dog, Guerilla Games, and Insomniac. Another victim is Firesprite Games, the UK studio behind The Playroom games and The Persistence, and an additional casualty from that studio is reportedly a new Twisted Metal title.\nAccording to Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, Firesprite had a Twisted Metal game in the works that has now been canceled. He reports that the game was a live-service title and very early in development, so it was not yet officially greenlit. You can read his full report here. \nNEW: As part of today's mass layoff, Sony has canceled a Twisted Metal live-service game that was in development at UK-based studio Firesprite, Bloomberg has learned.\nhttps://t.co/pvCDsS7yxe\nFebruary 27, 2024\nTwisted Metal was PlayStation’s original flagship series, launching a couple of months after the PS1 was released in North America in the fall of 1995. The series includes eight sequels/spin-offs, the last of which remains the 2012 reboot for PS3. Peacock’s well-received live-action series has at least kept the series alive and is getting a second season. \nThe number of layoffs to hit Firespirte is currently unknown. Sony acquired Firesprite in 2021, where it helped co-develop Horizon Call of the Mountain with Guerrilla Games. 900 employees have been laid off across several Sony 1st-party studios in various department. Blood & Truth creators London Studio has been shut down entirely. PlayStation Studios Hermen Hulst has cited overgrowth as the reason for the layoffs, and that the publisher has examined its portfolio of upcoming projects to determine which ones will cease production. It would appear that whatever this Twisted Metal project would have been, it's among several titles getting the axe. \n[Source: Bloomberg]",

While no details on microtransactions are given, the end of the trailer notes that players will get two free packs a day – implying that more than that might come at a cost.\nYou'll also be able to trade cards with other players and battle them online as well.

Called Pokémon Legends: Z-A, the teaser suggests the game will be set in Lumiose City, a Paris-inspired area first seen in Pokémon X and Y. It's not just a long-awaited follow up to Pokémon Legends: Arceus – it's an overdue return to the world of Pokémon X and Y.\nCheck out some images from the trailer below:\n\nThe teaser, which does not contain any actual gameplay footage, shows a Pikachu hopping around a city made of glowing blue lines. While it's not immediately clear that the city is Lumiose, eagle-eyed fans will notice many familiar friends from that generation of games, including Pyroar, Flabébé, Klefki, and Hawlucha. These images are juxtaposed with architectural sketches and the words \"urban redevelopment plan.\" This would suggest that Pokémon Legends Z might take place during the construction of Lumiose City, putting it in line with the historical setting we experienced with Pokémon Legends: Arceus.\nOther than the teaser, details are scarce. We'll have to wait until 2025 to see more. Speaking of 2025, we also recently heard reports that Nintendo's Switch successor will come out no sooner than March of that year.

Now, the companies have unveiled a new way to experience Lego in Fortnite: Lego Islands. Available today, Lego Islands is a family-friendly, all-ages play experience that sits alongside (and separate) from Lego Fortnite, and it's kicking off with two islands. \nThe first is Lego Raft Survival. Created in Unreal Editor for Fortnite, Raft Survival \"combines frenetic multiplayer problem solving with the classic Lego Pirates theme, as the infamous Blackbeard challenges players and their friends to stay afloat on a raft in unfriendly waters,\" a press release reads.

However, it wasn’t until its 2019 release, 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim, that the developer’s name became synonymous with “you should play this team’s games.” It’s hard to tell what, exactly, made 13 Sentinels the breakout title for Vanillaware, shipping more than 1 million copies worldwide as of August last year, making it the studio’s best-selling title. The easy answer is probably its beloved story, both in how it plays out and how it’s infused into the game’s real-time strategy mech combat.\nPublisher Atlus and Vanillaware released it in 2019, so when the team announced its latest title, Unicorn Overlord, last September, it was easy to conclude that this was the studio’s next big focus.

          "description": "During last week’s Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase, it was revealed that the 2021 action Metroidvania Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knight is getting a sequel in the form of Ender Magnolia: Bloom of the Mist. The initial trailer provided a vague 2024 launch window, but we now know it's hitting Steam Early Access first on March 26. \nEnder Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist is set within the same universe as Ender Lilies but takes place in the magically saturated Land of Fumes. A mind-warping toxin has been unleashed from the magic-infused soil and dangerous Homunguli ravages the land. It’s up to protagonist Lilac, an “Attunder” capable of cleansing Homunguli, to save the day. You can check out the game's new trailer below.\n\n\nLike Ender Lilies, Ender Magnolia is a dark fantasy Metroidvania in which Lilac is paired with another entity who actually handles the killing: a Spirit Reaper capable of killing Homunguli, which, in turn, adds their abilities to your arsenal. The sprawling 2D adventure tasks players with discovering hidden collectibles, gear, and items to bolster their ability to tackle a variety of bosses.\nWhile it’s unknown exactly how long Ender Magnolia will be in Early Access, Ender Lilies also went through an Early Access phase that wound up working to the game's benefit. Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist is slated to launch for PlayStation and Xbox platforms as well as Switch later this year. In the meantime, you can read our positive review of the Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knight here.",

As reported by Eurogamer, during the concert, which celebrated the Nier series' music in London, Taro apparently made a surprise appearance and asked for people to clap and cheer as loudly as they could so that Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu – in attendance – could hear the demand for more Nier, according to one fan at the event. \nHowever, the biggest tease of the night came from an on-screen word that appeared multiple times throughout \"the story of the show,\" SanTheSly, the fan in attendance, writes on ResetEra. \n\n\n\"[The] word REPENT was shown repeatedly as part of some dialogue,\" SanTheSly writes. \"The final instance was spelled as R3PENT. Both me and the person I'd gone with picked up on it and wondered if this was a tease.\" \nThat sounds like a tease to us; otherwise, why else change the word \"repent\" to randomly feature a \"3.\" However, some fans of the series already consider Nier Reincarnataion, a mobile gacha game shutting down in April, to be the third game in the series. On that timeline, Nier (and its remastered Nier: Replicant counterpart) is the first in the franchise and Nier: Automata the second. If Nier Reincarnation isn't the true third Nier game, perhaps Taro was teasing that could be on the way – Nier Repent does have a nice ring to it. \n[Source: Eurogamer]\nDo you want a third Nier game?

          "description": "Japanese outlet Nikkei is reporting that the Switch successor, or \"Switch 2\" as it's been dubbed colloquially within the games industry, is targeting a March 2025 launch, according to VideoGamesChronicle. This report follows earlier reporting from VGC and other outlets like Eurogamer that Nintendo's next console was originally targeting a 2024 launch before being pushed internally to the first quarter of 2025, which lines up with Nikkei's latest reporting. \n\n\nVGC reports that Nikkei writes, \"Priority was given to ensure the initial inventory of the successor console and a lineup of software titles at the time of its launch\" to curb the possibility of a stock shortage similar to what the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S experienced back in 2020. Following previous reports, Nikkei also writes that Nintendo's next console will be a hybrid home console-portable device like the Switch with a larger screen. \nFinally, Nikkei writes the internal target is March 2025 but that the Switch 2 could slip beyond that depending on manufacturing and the software available for the console's launch at that time, according to VGC. If it does launch in March of next year, it'd follow in the Switch's footsteps, which launched in March of 2017.\nIt's important to note that all of this should be taken with a grain of salt as these delays remain internal for the time being. The Switch's successor hasn't even been publicly revealed yet, so there's no telling when to expect it officially. In the meantime, though, read about how Nintendo reportedly demoed the Switch successor to developers at Gamescom last year. \n[Source: Nikkei via VideoGamesChronicle]\nDo you think March of next year is a good time for a new Nintendo console?

We enjoyed the game a lot, and you can read about why in Game Informer's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth review. It turns out, a lot of reviewers enjoyed the game too, because at the time of this writing, it's the second-highest rated game in the Final Fantasy series on Metacritic, as noted by video game sales analyst Benji-Sales on X (formerly Twitter). \nCurrently sitting at a 93 on Metacritic, which aggregates various reviews into a single Metacritic score, only one other Final Fantasy game has been rated higher: Final Fantasy IX on PlayStation 1. It has a 94 on Metacritic.\nThere’s only 6 Final Fantasy games that have gone above a 90 Metacritic score.\npic.twitter.com/8PvD3wfpvZ\nFebruary 22, 2024\nAs you can see above, with a 93 on Metacritic, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth joins a prestigious list of games in the series with a Metacritic score of 90 or higher, as pointed out by AndSpaceY on X. Now, it's important to note that some Final Fantasy games are not rated on Metacritic as the aggregate site was not around when they released. For example, Final Fantasy VI is one of the most beloved entries in the franchise and arguably the best – released in 1994 on the SNES, Metacritic was not around at the time so it does not have a rating on the site. \nStill, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth rating so high is another example of how Square Enix's Final Fantasy VII remake project is landing with both critics and fans alike. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth review and then check out our Final Fantasy VII Rebirth cover story hub for exclusive features, videos, and more.

If your language is missing or has more than a few dozen missing strings, please consider helping to finish your translation. Download Changelog Bug tracker",

The pixel-art OpenTTD fonts are iconic, but were designed for 640x480 CRT monitors rather than today’s 4k monsters. Without the horizontal smoothing of CRT scanlines, modern pixel-perfect rendering and 2x or 4x upscaling of the old bitmap/sprite-based fonts makes the text jagged and hard to read.",

For years, players have requested an easier way to keep vehicles with shared orders spaced out along their route. In OpenTTD 14, we’ve added one.",

We’ve also included fixes for various other issues which are listed in the full changelog linked below. Thanks to the reports made by many of you, we could solve the issues quickly. But never fear if you’ve missed out so far, there are still a lot of treasures to hunt for in this beta. Please share your findings on our issue tracker. And watch this space as we’ll soon start with our feature posts about the new things coming with OpenTTD 14.

For details of bugs fixed in each preview\nrelease, see previous entries on this blog.\nAccess real devices with Device Streaming in Android Studio\n\nDevice streaming in Android Studio lets you securely connect to remote physical Android devices hosted in Google's secure data centers. Powered by Firebase, it's the fastest and easiest way to test your app against real devices, including the Google Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, select Samsung devices, and more.\n\nAfter connecting to a device, you can deploy your app, view the display, interact with the device (including rotating or unfolding the device), and anything else you might do with a device over a direct ADB over SSL connection—all without leaving Android Studio. When you're done using the device, Google wipes all your data and factory resets the device before making it available to another developer.\nDuring Open Alpha, you can use Device Streaming at no cost. To get started simply sign into your Developer account from Android Studio and select a Firebase project. If you don't already have a Firebase project, it's easy to create one. To learn more, go to Device Streaming in Android Studio.\n\nGeneral fixes and features\nBelow is a list of general fixes in Android Studio Jellyfish | 2023.3.1 Canary 9 and Android Gradle Plugin 8.4.0-alpha09 These are a result of your bug \nreports, which help us to make Android Studio better.
