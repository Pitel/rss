This annual survey, which you can get a copy of from GDC's website, gives us an insight into the current state of the game industry.\nFor this year's survey, GDC spoke to over 2,300 game developers, and there are a few interesting things to note. One is that more game developers now work for independent studios rather than AAA. 39% of the devs surveyed currently work for an indie game company, while 23% work for a AAA developer. Most surveyed have been working in the industry for \"10 years or less\" — 57% in fact.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

There was the Tingle Tuner in Wind Waker, new content and secrets in games from Harry Potter to Crash Bandicoot, and an entire new town in Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life.\nBack on the GameCube, A Wonderful Life had a path near the farm that went up a hill, but it didn't go anywhere. Trying to go up the path would lead to a cutscene where the Harvest Sprites would halt you, saying that you could find out \"what's going on\" by linking up with Friends of Mineral Town on the Game Boy Advance, which required the link cable, a GBA, and a copy of the game.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

You bet your chunky GamePad it didn’t.\nInstead of wallowing in self-pity, Nintendo knuckled down and used the Wii U's failure as a learning experience, addressing each imperfection and fashioning a little device with a clear, easy-to-understand, and appealing proposition for players who had found its predecessor's asymmetric gameplay confusing or underwhelming.

Next comes Far Cry 2: Buddy Bonanza, which lets you make lots of lovely AI friends, charge into battles together, and then hide while they die. Then, there’s Far Cry 2: Firewatch, which is all about watching fire. It's the best.\nRead more",

Then it became a deep sense of longing for something I'd lost, like a cascade of sand that fell from my palm as I wept gently on an empty beach. The \"it\" is a mobile and Nintendo Switch game called Pokémon Quest (don't laugh), which was the first - and only -  mobile game I've actively obsessed over.\nThe game's an auto-battler where you gather a small trio from the original 150 Pokéfolks, level them up, and then tackle trickier and trickier stages. After a frankly disgusting number of hours, I'd finished all the stages. So, I thought, \"Yes, of course they will add the 2nd generation of Pokéfolks with a bunch of new stages. This is its natural evolution, if you will\". It still hasn't happened and probably never will. And I hate that I can't find anything else that'll replace it.\nRead more",

What begins as a YA coming-of-age tale about a small-town romance quickly gains remarkable momentum, and suddenly you’re dealing with supernatural teens trying to desperately stop a world-ending calamity. Part sci-fi drama, part high school romance, A Space For The Unbound manages to have incredible weight and grandeur while also being poignant, sweet, and honest at the same time.

There's even a charming new graphics overhaul to replace the famous ASCII symbols which, depending on who you ask, might not have technically counted as \"graphics\" at all.\nI'm not here to discuss the relative merits of this shiny new version and the \"classic\" version. Both will be updated in future, the latter still free, and neither expected to reach a full 1.0 release inside 20 years. All this chips around the edges of what I've been pondering, which is this: What exactly is Dwarf Fortress's place within our culture now, after a decade replete with games that looked to it for ideas?\nRead more",

Looking back, was I naïve? Yes. And was I wrong? I'm delighted to report that I was catastrophically wrong.\nFrom what I've played so far of Persona 3, I reckon it's well worth a whirl if you're a newcomer, or a Persona 5 fan who's concerned that a game from 2009 won't be all that good. Not only does it stand on its own as a fun high school mystery with an alarmingly dark undertone, it almost acts as a fun history lesson too.\nRead more",

Well, three. Camp one was excited for the TV show and camp two posited that there's no point making an adaptation of something if your adaptation is just the same thing. (The third camp was \"eh, I might check it out\" and watched the other two camps duking it out). I was in camp two. If you're adapting something, adapt! Make changes! Otherwise I might as well just consume the original thing again! The Last Of Us has already been released, what, three times?\nThis was made funnier by the fact that nobody on staff had seen the TV show, so we were just arguing about tweets we'd seen that describe the show, the worst way to conduct a discussion outside of e.g. scrawling insults on the side of Teslas and self-driving them into each other's front doors. But it got me to thinking about adaptations, because there have been loads of adaptations of things that aren't games into video games. What goes wrong in the other direction?\nRead more",

There was a lot to take in, from robo-gloves, to sex-dom vending machines, to grannies with bazookas.\nI went in with expectations that it might be a little like BioShock, all steely and serious in its delivery of some vaguely philosophical truth. But I emerged with a totally different impression. Far from polished seriousness, Atomic Heart seems a little disjointed in its ambition, with a main character who almost immediately kills any atmosphere when he opens his mouth.\nRead more",

          "description": "At a time when LucasArts was cheerfully mocking rival developer Sierra's fondness for punishing players with game overs you could trigger at the drop of a hat, Sierra themselves seemed intent to double down. In Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers, not only can the titular protagonist suffer a variety of gruesome fates if you so much as put a foot wrong, but there's a point where you can soft-lock the entire game by failing to pick up an easily missable single snake scale from a busy crime scene — and you won't even know you did anything wrong for several in-game days. I'm not 100% sure this wasn't an oversight on the part of the developers, but at the same time, that's exactly the sort of shit that Sierra liked to pull.\nRead more",

Farlanders is my messy breakup.\nIt's a space colony city builder with a puzzle game mentality - and set on Mars to make things even more enticing. The best part of Farlanders is its story, and while it’s not quite a full-blown commentary on colonialism, it examines what you’re doing and why you’re doing it with a self-awareness that I did not expect at all. That being said, annoying difficulty curves, awkward terraforming, and frustrating progression systems stop this space colony sim from really taking off. A graph charting my enjoyment over time would look like a child’s drawing of a mountain.\nRead more",

Every enemy sits still, waiting for you to come and whack it. Whack willy-nilly, though, and they'll kill you in no time - so you have to tactically explore parts of each level to heal, while targeting foes in an order that lets you survive long enough to level up and take on the big bads. \nDesktop Dungeons: Rewind is an upcoming \"modern remastering\" of the original, with 3D graphics and the ability to rewind time rather than start each level from the very beginning. It's got a demo you can play right now, and it's adding free daily challenges with a sharable leaderboard later this month. I am hyped.\n\n \nRead more",

Even if that place is still turtleneck-deep in extraterrestrial viscera.

You play as an android revived several decades after an apocalypse, by a tiny camp of survivors who inevitably need your help. A lot of this help involves, well, platforming. To the point of having nonsensical areas of pure platforming in between you and a destination or secret area. You'll climb, jump, do the little dash thing that recharges when you touch the ground or pick up a hovering lamp thingy. You'll land on a lot of thorny instakill spikes.\r\n\n\r\nSo yeh, lots of the old platforming, but it feels more like an exploration and scavenging game, with a side order of light-light-heavy-dodge combat too. And a plot with varied dialogue options and mysteries about the world and its history. It's immediately and consistently fun, but I'm not sure exactly how to recommend it. Hmm.\r\n\n \nRead more",

One of them was Broken Roads, an isometric RPG set in a post-apocalypse Australia. The gorgeous artwork was enough for me to click on the Steam page and read more, and while scrolling through the screenshots something strange caught my eye.\nIt was a screenshot of a fairly traditional RPG dialogue scene, with a panel at the bottom displaying all the possible dialogue options for the player. But what caught my eye was an unusual radial graphic on the right-hand side of the options. Reading on, I discovered that Broken Roads uses a rather unique Moral Compass, one which plots your overall moral stance towards the world and its people with a golden arc. Different decisions may rotate the arc, expand it, contract it, lengthen it, or shorten it. And in so doing, you'll unlock various traits dotted about the Compass, which only remain in effect for as long as that golden arc covers those traits within the wheel.\nI can see a dozen different ways in which this Moral Compass may end up being a bad idea in practice. But I don't care. I adore it. And I'm going to play Broken Roads solely so I can see the consequences of my actions in satisfying radial form.\nRead more",

Well, a mercenary gotta eat, I suppose.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFGohawKKNE&ab_channel=Marvel%27sMidnightSuns\nThe Deadpool update is the first of a series of mini-expansions headed to Marvel's Midnight Suns in 2023. Future DLC will include similar packs for the freaky symbiote, Venom; the Living Vampire, Morbius, and the weather-warning X-Men queen, Storm. All character downloads can be purchased separately or are available as part of the Midnight Suns' season pass. For more details on the game itself, which proved to be one of the finer comic book offerings of recent years, check out Chris Carter's review right here.\nMarvel's Midnight Suns is available now on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X. Ports for PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch are reportedly in the works, although news on these editions has been a little quiet as of late.\nThe post Deadpool brings the mayhem to Marvel’s Midnight Suns next week appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A harrowing journey to the end of the world\nI never get tired of a good narrative game, so when I see a trailer that looks good enough to grab my attention, I can't help but get excited about a potential new story-driven gem. That's absolutely the case when it comes to The Pale Beyond, a narrative polar exploration game that's set to release on February 24, 2023. The title was originally announced back in November of 2021, and its story will follow the crew of a vessel named The Temperance, who have set out on an expedition toward the South Pole in an attempt to discover the mystery of their lost sister ship, the Viscount, which set out on a journey to find the absolute magnetic South five years prior.\nhttps://youtu.be/PvvkUPPJc_E\nThe Pale Beyond's launch trailer shows off some of the game's foremost mechanics, like resource and morale management and survival simulation — one can imagine how those elements will tie into tough narrative choices the player must make for the survival of the crew. What really grabbed me about this game is its art style, from the painterly backdrops to the hand-drawn character portraits. Here's hoping that the gameplay experience will hold up against the gorgeous visuals.\nI'm a big fan of these harrowing, tension-filled \"journey\" narratives, and it's certainly not a story I've played in a game for a good while now, so I'm looking forward to checking out The Pale Beyond once it drops. If the game looks interesting to you as well and you want to get a taste before the release date, there's also a demo you can download on The Pale Beyond's Steam page right now.\nThe post Chilling narrative exploration game The Pale Beyond releases next month appeared first on Destructoid.",

Here's hoping that today's news is still something of a respite, despite the Definitive Edition's rough start.\nEither way, the trilogy is now available to purchase on Steam, and is also playable on the Steam Deck, which should be exciting to hear for at least some of the GTA diehards out there. Rockstar also stated that they'll be making the game available on the Epic Games Store later this month, so Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy — The Definitive Edition will be even more accessible to PC players soon enough.\nhttps://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1616138619273478146\nThis is the first time GTA 3, Vice City, and San Andreas will be available on Steam after they were delisted with the release of the Definitive Edition a few years ago -- players previously had to access them through Rockstar's own store if they wanted to play them on the PC at all over the past few years. The trilogy is still available to play on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X, but here's hoping the Steam Deck capability will make it up to any players who have dealt with any Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy — The Definitive Edition-caused headaches over the past few years.\nThe post The Grand Theft Auto trilogy is back on Steam, playable on Steam Deck appeared first on Destructoid.",

One upcoming title I've had my eye on is Gourdlets, a city-building simulator that has \"no objectives, no points, just building.\" Say no more — I know for a fact that this title is going to be right up my alley, especially with its pastel color palette and adorable vegetable villagers.\nBased on a new trailer that publisher AuntyGames posted, will be able to decorate their towns with all kinds of cute buildings, trees, flowers, crops, fences, and paths. Your villagers will also be able to take part in cozy activities like roasting marshmallows, building sand castles, and the simulator staple: fishing. You'll be able to \"Watch the population of gourdlets grow and interact with the town as you create it,\" according to the game's Steam page, and chill out as you \"watch the little gourdlets live their little lives.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_LoaTunj4\nI'm excited to see a new entry in the cozy simulator genre that's more of an open-ended, sandboxy thing as opposed to a game with a more rigid quest structure. I've been having a blast with Disney's Dreamlight Valley, but I know after binging dozens of hours of a game that requires a good deal of grinding for materials, a more relaxed experience will be a welcome respite. Gourdlets' gameplay and art style also remind me of another excellent city-builder called Townscaper, which shares in its bright colors and laid-back tone.\nGourdlets doesn't have a release window yet, but the extended demo is available to download on Steam right now!\nThe post Cozy city-builder Gourdlets gets a new trailer, demo appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "We missed you, 1v1\nWarzone 2.0 brought about a whole host of changes to Call of Duty's beloved battle royale mode, but the most divisive of them all has to be the new version of the Gulag, which changed from a 1v1 fight to a 2v2 with the introduction of the sequel. As if it wasn't already hard enough contending with two enemies instead of one, especially if you have a teammate who is AFK, uncooperative, etc., they also added a Jailer with a minigun for you to contend with, too. It's clear to me why this was one of the least popular changes that came along with Warzone 2.0.\nThankfully we won't have to put up with it for very much longer, though, because Infinity Ward has announced on Twitter that they're reverting the Gulag back to its former 1v1 glory. This change is scheduled to be implemented along with the Season 2 update for both Warzone 2.0 and Modern Warfare II, which we learned yesterday has been delayed by two weeks. I guess this gives us yet another reason to look forward to the game's second season, along with bug fixes, a new Raid episode, and new game modes, just to name a few of the upcoming features.\nhttps://twitter.com/InfinityWard/status/1616133411189710848\nSeason 2 is officially dropping on February 15, as per a tweet from the Call of Duty Twitter account yesterday, so we only have to deal with the 2v2 shenanigans for a little while longer.

King rounds off the look with a similarly colored variant of his Jaguar mask and a massive pair of white running shoes. Over the following years, the look has become something of a meme icon among the Tekken community.\n\nYesterday, PRIX launched replica designs of both the track pants and the shirt, both priced at $70. A form-fitting, long sleeve variant of the shirt was also available at $60. Of course, there was a wild rush on these fashion-forward items, resulting in a total sell-out of the pants, while most of the shirt inventory was also cleared out double-quick time. There is currently a waiting list available on site for all those hoping to jump on any possible re-stocks.\nIn addition to the King gear, PRIX also released a line of T-shirts featuring renders of characters from Tekken 3. Again, these items are mostly long gone, with only Extra Small-to-Small sizes still available at the time of writing. You can check out the entire range over on the PRIX website.\nCongratulations to the lucky buyers.

It's like if Mario Party and Dragon Quest somehow blended together into a chaotic competition for the throne.\nPlaying as one of several adventurers, each player's goal is to defeat beasts, gather money, and eventually win the throne. Of course, while this is your goal, it's everyone else's too, and there can only be one ruler in the Dokapon Kingdom.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfU6eDroSN4\nTake down monsters or other players, gain control of towns, and learn new job classes all in pursuit of the ultimate victory. There are five different game modes to choose from: Normal, Story, Shopping Race, Kill Race, and Town Race. Plus, the board is fairly expansive, so there's good reason to replay it in different modes and combinations.\nOne big addition is the Connect aspect of Dokapon Kingdom: Connect. Players will be able to hop online and battle with their friends across the different game modes too, so now you won't need to all be on the same couch to fight for the kingdom. If my experience with Mario Party is any indication, it might be better that players are not in close proximity for these games.\nMy kingdom on the Switch\nDokapon Kingdom is one of those games I've heard whispered about time and again. It's often described as an alternative to Mario Party, one that maintains the screwing-over-your-friends fun but eschews some of the mini-games in favor of some light RPG activities.\nHonestly, the style mash-up of classic RPGs and party games alone is enough to draw me in.

While several of these titles have resurfaced in recent years, in the form of remasters, remakes, and re-imaginings, it's worthwhile diving back in time to appreciate them in their original glory. As with any list, there are many other excellent candidates worth checking out, but for those looking to experience (or re-experience) what the PlayStation 2 has to …",

Although there is a host of post-launch content on the way, Fire Emblem Engage doesn't seem to be party to that yet.\nAs shared on the official Japanese Nintendo Switch support site, Fire Emblem Engage will be updated to \"version 1.1.0\" today, essentially for the Japanese launch (and global launch on January 20). You can find the full translated patch notes below.\nFire Emblem Engage launch patch notes (Ver.1.1.0)\nGeneral\nCompatible with Expansion Pass.\nA link to the Nintendo eShop \"Additional Content\" has been added to the title screen.\nAdded free update benefits. You can receive it when you go to the [Somniel] after Chapter 5.\nYou can now use functions related to Internet communication.\nIn short, the update patches in the DLC/season/expansion pass (which you'd need internet access for anyway), both in terms of the content itself, and the functionality from the main menu. It also has the added bonus of \"update benefits,\" which typically includes minor gift-like items that are collected en masse through a menu. You'll get them automatically after reaching Chapter 5 in the game (the chapter you're on is visible whenever you save, so it'll be easy to spot), after manually visiting the Somniel: the hub zone of Fire Emblem Engage.\nThe post The Fire Emblem Engage launch patch is thankfully small: here are all the updates appeared first on Destructoid.",

The crux of the release, however, lies in its fully remixed and re-recorded soundtrack, which sports a plethora of celebrated names from Japan's electronica scene.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIaYNsy57CA&ab_channel=NISAmerica\nAmong the musicians featured in the new release are GoSatoBan, Heavy Metal Raiden, Fantom Iris, O.T.K., Soshi Hosoi, Daisuke Matsumoto, Cosio, Keishi Yonao, Ryu☆, Raito, and Yu Shimoda — who have recorded a total of 20 new stage and boss battle themes. Raiden III x MIKADO MANIAX also features a customizable U.I. and soundtrack, allowing players to choose from a selection of wallpapers, and define a personal playlist of their favourite tunes from both the original and re-recorded scores.\nRaiden III x MIKADO MANIAX launches summer 2023 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch. A Collector's Edition is now available to pre-order from the NIS America Online Store.

I'm stoked to see what the overall reception is like, especially coming off of the super-popular Three Houses, which also had some divisive opinions on its heavy slant toward social aspects. Given that Engage strips many of those away (and puts a larger focus on the strategic action), that decision is going to also be somewhat polarizing. Overall, I think the quality of the game will shine through for a lot of people though.\nOf course, there are two huge ports coming to the Switch today too: Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden.

With that spirit in mind, Like a Dragon: Ishin! is highlighting its farming life mode in a new trailer.\nIn a mode called \"Another Life,\" Ishin protagonist Ryoma leaves the violence for another day and instead tends to his quiet farm. We see a host of different mini-games and activities here, centered around living off the land. There's harvesting crops, chopping up veggies and preparing meat through cooking, and yes, even pets.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZJ_dc5gv-k\nIt's something special seeing a dog do a backflip. This side story seems to be bringing a heaping pile of peaceful slice-of-life warmth to the table, and I do enjoy that.\nFarming like a dragon\nLike a Dragon: Ishin! is the updated version of its historical fiction predecessor, which takes the cast of the Like a Dragon series and has them play out a story in a real, historical setting. Longtime series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu stars as Ryoma, and other characters from the series are set to appear as well.\nIshin is one of the Like a Dragon entries that hadn't arrived in the West yet. An official launch on modern consoles makes this a bit easier to get a hold of and play. Plus, now U.S. players can experience the joy of tending to a farm in 1860s Japan. Of course, there will still be fighting, intrigue, and plenty of drama. It's nice to have options, though.\nIf the quiet life appeals to you, you won't need to wait long to experience it either. Like a Dragon: Ishin! arrives for PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC on February 21, 2023.\nThe post Like a Dragon: Ishin! shows a slice of the quiet farm life in new trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

Paradox Interactive and developer Triumph Studios are bringing Age of Wonders 4 to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on May 2, 2023.\nAge of Wonders 4 will mark the latest installment in the fantasy strategy series since 2019's sci-fi spin-off Age of Wonders: Planetfall, and the first numbered installment since 2014's Age of Wonders III. With the fourth entry, Triumph Studios returns to the fantasy realm with its usual mix of magic, role-playing, strategy, and turn-based battles.\nA showcase is being hosted today on the Paradox Interactive Twitch channel, highlighting some of what's in store for the new Age of Wonders. But if you want a glimpse of the future, there's also a teaser trailer here too:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgV66Jdj23c\nThe different factions are composed of the usual fantasy races, including moon elves and halflings, and can be altered even further with tomes of magic. The big world map and focused-in turn-based battles make for small choices that can ripple out across the map.\n\nStories of adventure\nFor Age of Wonders 4, a new event system will add some extra storytelling potential. Triumph says decisions will shape the world around you, responding to your goals and ambitions, and that you may even see your own creations appear as rivals or allies in subsequent games.\nCreation and open-ended storytelling potential seem to be the draws here, and it sounds pretty neat. Having dabbled just a small bit in Age of Wonders III ages ago, I'm curious to see what this team has put together for its return to the fantasy realm. We won't have to wait long to find out, either. Age of Wonders 4 aims to launch on May 2, 2023 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.\nThe post Age of Wonders 4 marks a return for the fantasy strategy series this May appeared first on Destructoid.",

In a follow-up tweet, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier says it sounds like the Halo Infinite team got \"hit hard,\" citing an email to staff from 343 head Pierre Hintze.\nKotaku also reports that 343 and Bethesda were affected, as well as Gears developer The Coalition.\nIn addition to layoffs, it seems like movement is also being made around 343 Industries. Schreier reports that Joseph Staten, who was brought on to help bring Halo Infinite development to a close, is leaving 343 to return to Xbox Publishing.\nMore details have been emerging throughout the day about how these cuts have affected Microsoft.\nA shift for Xbox\nIn a public letter addressing the cuts today, CEO Satya Nadella confirms the 10,000 layoffs will take place from now through Q3 of fiscal year 2023. The news arrives one year after Microsoft announced its plan to purchase Activision Blizzard, a deal which is currently caught up with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.\nThe post Bethesda, 343 among studios reportedly affected by Microsoft layoffs appeared first on Destructoid.",

I myself am something of a power washing enthusiast, of which there are whole communities out there, so this sim is right up my alley. The game already has hours of satisfying cleaning content, but along with the announcement that PowerWash Simulator is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch, Square Enix also announced that they're dropping a Tomb Raider expansion to boot. The free update will be available to players at 9 am EST / 12 pm PST / 5 pm GMT on January 31, 2023.\nhttps://twitter.com/playstation/status/1615759845625298951?s=46&t=GyZv8BwH84imBShPI-gkHw\n\"You’ve cleaned a bungalow, a cottage, even a tree-house,\" says a blog from developer FuturLab, \"but how about a manor?\" That's right, the new location in need of a powerful wash will be none other than Croft Manor from the famed Tomb Raider series. Not only will the update include a new map to take on, but it will also come with \"an all-new mini campaign, with a short story and five new levels.\"\nPowerWash Simulator, is also coming to PlayStation 4/5 consoles and the Nintendo Switch for the first time, in addition to its launch platforms on PC, Xbox One, and Xbox series X/S.

Koei Tecmo and the Atelier team are pushing the launch date of Atelier Ryza 3: Alchemist of the End & the Secret Key back one month.\nThis moves the Atelier Ryza 3 launch to March 24, 2023, just one month removed from its previous February 24 date. In a statement on the shift, producer Junzo Hosoi says that in order to make this a \"fitting finale\" for Ryza and friends, the team has taken on challenges like a vast open field and more expressive graphics.\n\"Our team will take this additional time to fine-tune the final touches so that we can deliver to all of you who have been following the series for the best possible experience in this culmination of Ryza and her friend's adventures,\" said Hosoi. \"We are making the game even better to make it worth your wait, so we appreciate your patience for just a little bit more until the game's release.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDG_g2tcsNY\nAtelier Ryza 3 will cap off the Ryza series, with a note on the site saying this is Ryza's \"final summer adventure\" with one final secret. It seems like the Atelier team wants to make sure the ending comes together well.\nAfter the summer is gone\nOne month is not much in the grand scheme of things, and certainly not much compared to other game delays. And if the extra time means the Atelier studio can get everything right, that's a good thing.\nThe one troublesome note is that Atelier Ryza 3 now launches on the same day as the remake of Resident Evil 4. But its previous date was also in contention with another game, and inside its own genre at that, with Octopath Traveler II. Really, there's little chance of having a big week to yourself in 2023, as a bunch of games are already slated to launch in the first quarter of the year.\nThe post Atelier Ryza 3 takes one-month delay, will now launch in March appeared first on Destructoid.",

Neither Activision nor Infinity Ward have officially announced any dates yet regarding the new season, but fans have surmised that the release date was supposed to be February 1 by looking at the days left on the Season 1 battle pass.\nBased on a tweet from known data miner CODSploitz, Season 2 will allegedly drop on or around February 15. By mining for the dates of the last Season 1 bundle, CODSploitz claims to have found that the final Scavenger bundle will be available in the store from February 2-15 -- hence the supposed Season 2 delay to that date, or sometime after it. CODSploitz's predictions have been right in the past, so we'll have to see if this one helps or hurts his track record when Season 2 finally drops.\nhttps://twitter.com/codsploitz_imgs/status/1615158500493037568\nThe last major update we saw for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II came in the form of Season 1 Reloaded from back in December. That update came with bug fixes, which added the Chimera assault rifle, the brand new Raid mode, and my personal favorite, the Shipment 6v6 multiplayer map. There's been some speculation that Season 2 will bring another new Raid episode, but other than that, the second season will likely be full of surprises.\nThe post Warzone 2 and MW2’s Season 2 getting hit with a delay (Update) appeared first on Destructoid.",

And you just don't stop!\nThe era of Monster Hunter madness continues, as publisher Capcom has announced that the Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak expansion has now surpassed five million total sales on PC and Nintendo Switch.\nReleased in June 2022 for both Nintendo Switch and the then-debuting PC port of Monster Hunter Rise, the Sunbreak DLC brought with it the epic \"Journey to the West\" story expansion, along with a huge litany of new locations and both new and classic monsters pulled from the long, long legacy of the Monster Hunter franchise, such as the terrifying flying wyvern, Astalos. The Sunbreak expansion enhanced Monster Hunter Rise's combat mechanics for smoother, more exciting beast battles.\nhttps://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1615575865781354500?s=20&t=BIxMDbybdONo5qofHhzA4Q\nAccompanying a lovely piece of artwork — posted to Twitter to commemorate the Sunbreak sales announcement — Capcom noted that it would be producing a special in-game pack for all players to celebrate hitting the five million milestone. We can likely expect more details on this DLC in the coming weeks. The success of Sunbreak only cements the incredible global growth of the Monster Hunter brand in the past five years, initially driven by the staggering worldwide success of 2018's Monster Hunter World which remains as of this writing, the best-selling Capcom release of all-time.\nMonster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak is available now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak expansion hits five million sales appeared first on Destructoid.",

A statement from the president of Polyphony Games details that “While 2-player splitscreen races are not supported in VR, all other races, including online races, will be available.” In case you missed it, Resident Evil Village will also get a VR update on launch day.\nThis list of 13 joins the existing lineup of 11 VR games PlayStation announced last November and the six games announced in December. Combined with other previously announced titles, like Horizon: Call of the Mountain, PlayStation VR2 will have over 30 games available to play within a month of launch.\nPlayStation VR2 is set to come out on February 22, just over a month from today.

          "description": "Netflix's Sonic Prime series hit the streaming service back in December, and it seems more episodes are on the way. \nWhile it sits at a 60 percent critic score on Rotten Tomatoes, Sonic Prime received an 88 percent audience score, which is pretty great as far as video game TV shows go. Of course, Rotten Tomatoes doesn't account for every person that watched the series, but it's a quick look at what audiences thought. It seems Netflix is ready to answer the desire for more because the official Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter account announced today that more Sonic Prime episodes are coming later this year. \nGet ready to sink into more Sonic Prime, coming your way later this year! pic.twitter.com/VNz1aDYfph\nJanuary 18, 2023\nAs you can see, there's not much to go on here, so it's currently unclear if these are just additional episodes or the reveal that a Season 2 is happening. Regardless, more Sonic Prime is coming to Netflix in 2023. \nWhile waiting to learn more, read Game Informer's Sonic Frontiers review and then check out these 10 Sonic Frontiers tips to help you build momentum in the blue blur's latest adventure.

Interactive have released a new cinematic trailer for Hogwarts Legacy, giving viewers a bird's eye view, literally, of the titular school and the surrounding castle grounds. \nWith Hogwarts Legacy due out on current-get consoles and PC in just a few weeks, on February 10, it's no surprise we're getting a trailer like this today. It's a great look at what to expect in the game, including beasts and creatures, characters like Professor Weasley and Nearly Headless Nick, and more. There's even some Avada Kadavra-casting foes to be seen, as well as dragons and spiders to fights. And all of it is shown through the view of an owl delivering a Hogwarts acceptance letter to a soon-to-be wizard. \nCheck out the 4K version of this Hogwarts Legacy cinematic trailer below: \n\n\nFor more about Hogwarts Legacy, check out everything we learned in the second gameplay showcase, which aired last month, and then read about the latest details revealed during a Sony State of Play last year. Check out Hogwarts Legacy's PlayStation 5 DualSense features after that. Read about how controversial Harry Potter creator JK Rowling is not involved with the making of Hogwarts Legacy (although she will almost certainly be getting money as a direct result of this game) and then check out this trailer showcasing common rooms, easter eggs, and more. \nHogwarts Legacy hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on February 10. It launches on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on April 4, and finally, the Switch version will be released on July 25. \nAre you picking up Hogwarts Legacy next month?

          "description": "Persona 3 released in North America in 2007 on PlayStation 2 and was a mild hit. The dark, teen drama RPG had a niche audience, but those who found the game adored it. The game received a special edition release with added in content in 2008 with FES, and was then re-released a third time for PSP in 2010 with the most added content, but some modifications made to run on Sony's handheld platform.\nPersona 4 followed – again a mild hit – but then Persona 5 came along and cemented the franchise's reputation as one of the best RPGs ever made. Fans who discovered the series with 5 have wanted to figure out what they've been missing out on, and longtime players have been demanding the re-release of 3 so that a larger audience could play what many call their favorite. After arguably too long, Atlus is finally ready to make that happen with the re-re-re-release of Persona 3 on modern consoles January 19.\nJoin Kyle Hilliard and Wesley LeBlanc as they look at the game's first true dungeon and chat about perhaps the most controversial Persona game in the series.\n\n\nFor more previews of some of the biggest games of 2022 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider, Fire Emblem Engage, Clive 'N' Wrench, Inkulinati, Outer Terror, and more.",

However, past Stadia Pro subscriptions will not receive refunds.\nThere's a silver lining for those of you with Stadia controllers and nothing to use them for. You can download an update that will allow your controller to use Bluetooth. However, be warned: this permanently disables wi-fi capabilities, so if you download the update now, you won't be able to play Stadia games before the shutdown. For more details, you can visit the Stadia Help Center.\nStadians, you can now update your Stadia Controller’s firmware to enable Bluetooth Low Energy connections.\nhttps://t.co/o0iU2x0NsV pic.twitter.com/SxzUYJyRrh\nJanuary 17, 2023\nIf you missed the news about the shutdown, last September, Stadia’s VP and General Manager said in a blog post that “while Stadia's approach to streaming games for consumers was built on a strong technology foundation, it hasn't gained the traction with users that we expected so we’ve made the difficult decision to begin winding down our Stadia streaming service.” \nStadia’s struggles were no secret. Its first-party studios were shut down just over a year in, with the service being “deprioritized” a year later. While it was an interesting experiment, some experiments are just destined to fail.

We look forward to fans around the world enjoying the rest of the season.\" \n\"Our focus was simply to make the best possible adaption of this beloved story for as big an audience as we could,\" Druckmann and Mazin said, according to Deadline. \"We are overjoyed to see how many fans, both old and new, have welcomed The Last of Us into their homes and their hearts.\" \nWhile waiting for this week's episode, read our interview with Druckmann and Joel actor Pedro Pascal about how The Last of Us was changed for TV, and then read about how there are no plans for The Last of Us show to go beyond the games. \n[Source: Deadline]",

Fortunately, this new trailer is nearly two minutes of cinematics and gameplay from the remake focused on the story of Dead Space. As expected, this remake isn't changing much at all, utilizing the same story from the original 2008 release with updated visuals and audio (plus some new voice lines for protagonist Isaac Clarke). \nCheck out the new Dead Space Remake \"Humanity Ends Here\" trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Dead Space Remake continues to look great and we can't wait to play it in just a few weeks. \nFor more about the game, check out this extended Dead Space Remake gameplay look and then read why it's one of Game Informer's 25 most anticipated games of 2023.

          "description": "Final Fantasy XVI is due out June 22 exclusively on PlayStation 5, but some fans believe a PC version of the game could release as soon as six months after its console debut. However, FF16 producer Naoki Yoshida isn't sure why. \nDuring a recent Final Fantasy XIV stream, Yoshida, who is a director on that game, was asked about rumors surrounding a PC version of FF16, and he responded, \"I don't know where the notion of a PC version releasing six months after the game is out came from as none of us have ever said that,\" according to a translator, as reported by Eurogamer. He followed it up with two instances urging fans to buy the PS5 version. \nAccording to a translation by Siliconera, Yoshida also said, \"There's been talk that the PC version will come out, but no one on the team has said anything about the PC version. I wonder why people assume the PC version will arrive six months after [the PS5 version], so just go ahead and buy a PS5.\" \nThe talk of a PC version of the game stems from a promotional PlayStation 5 video released last year that says in small print that FF16 will be a \"PS5 exclusive for six months.\" Some extrapolated from this small print that a PC release of the game will come after that six months of exclusivity is up, but if Yoshida's recent comments are any indication, the team has nothing to say in regards to a PC version. \nFinal Fantasy XVI hits PlayStation 5 on June 22. While waiting for more information, watch this \"Ambition\" trailer that reveals more about Valisthea's kingdoms, dominants, and eikons, and then check out our interview with Yoshida about the game's boss fights. \n[Source: Eurogamer]\nAre you picking up Final Fantasy XVI on PS5 or waiting for the rumored PC release?

          "description": "Don't expect The Last of Us HBO show to extend beyond the story of the two games in the series. That's because The Last of Us game director Neil Druckmann says there are no plans for stories beyond the games in this show.\nThis news comes by way of a new interview with Druckmann from The Hollywood Reporter, as reported by GameSpot. Here's what Druckmann told THR specifically: \"We have no plans to tell any stories beyond adapting the games. We won't run into the same issue as Game of Thrones since The Last of Us Part: II doesn't end on a cliffhanger.\" \n\n\nDruckmann and TV series writer Craig Mazin have mentioned that a second season of this show might cover the events of The Last of Us Part II (personally, I think The Last of Us Part II could cover two seasons of television). Despite the duo not wanting the show to go beyond the games, there might be a way for the show to cover more ground after the events of The Last of Us Part II. If Naughty Dog were to develop a theoretical The Last of Us Part III, it wouldn't be surprising if the HBO show covered that down the road. Chances seem pretty good considering Druckmann told THR that there is \"more story to tell\" in the world of The Last of Us games. \nMazin also touched on his desire not to extend the show beyond the games in the THR interview, as noted by GameSpot, stating that he doesn't \"have any interest in a spinning-plates-go-on-forever show.\" \n\"When it becomes a perpetual motion machine, it just can't help but get kind of...stupid,\" he continued. \"Endings mean everything to me.\" \nFor more about The Last of Us on HBO, read our interview with Joel actor Pedro Pascal and Druckmann about the changes made for this TV show. Check out this new piece of concept art from The Last of Us multiplayer game that Naughty Dog is currently developing after that. \n[Source: GameSpot via The Hollywood Reporter]\nWhat scene are you most excited to see in The Last of Us on HBO?

But perhaps more than any property that has moved from interactive medium to passive television, The Last of Us seems most suited to make the transition. Joel and Ellie’s story is an emotional and cinematic one that does not rely on player choice.\nAhead of the show’s premiere we spoke with some of the actors about the adaptation, as well as Neil Druckmann, co-creator of The Last of Us, who was heavily involved in writing the show and directed a few episodes.\nDruckmann is no stranger to directing actors, even if the recording process of a TV show is different from how it works in a video game. “There is a certain luxury we have in video games that when we capture a performance, we have eve…",

You get Gravity Circuit, a promising indie action title launching later this year. \nPlayers control Kai, a lone warrior battling an evil robotic army in a post-apocalyptic world. This side-scrolling action title boasts plenty of satisfying action thanks to Kai’s fun melee combat, nimble platforming abilities, and his signature grappling hook, which he uses to traverse levels as well as yank and toss enemies. Sporting great 16-bit art and a strong soundtrack, Gravity Circuit is worth keeping an eye on for fans of classic throwbacks. \nJoin editors Wesley LeBlanc and Marcus Stewart as they explore Gravity Circuit’s free Steam demo and discuss why it may be one of the year’s most exciting indie gems.\n\n\nFor more previews of some of the biggest games of 2022 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Fire Emblem Engage, Clive 'N' Wrench, Inkulinati, Outer Terror, and more.",

That story is about the GT Academy contest, which was a real contest held between 2008 and 2016 by Sony and Nissan. Winners were given entrance into Nissan's Driver Development Program, as noted by Video Games Chronicle. The film appears to be telling the tale of someone who won entrance into this program and then went on to become a real success in the racing world. \nCheck out the Gran Turismo sneak peek for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, this sneak peek is a mix of what appears to be movie footage and behind-the-scenes footage, with stars like Harbour, Barnet, and Bloom talking about their excitement for the film. \nGran Turismo hits theaters later this year on August 11. \nAlongside this sneak peek, Sony also revealed that Gran Turismo 7, the latest in the long-running series released last year, will be getting an update that makes the game playable on its upcoming PSVR2 platform. \nWhile waiting to learn more about this Gran Turismo movie, read about Project Leonardo, a new customizable accessibility controller kit PlayStation unveiled yesterday and then read about how the PlayStation 5 has surpassed 30 million units sold. \nAre you excited about this Gran Turismo movie?

One of those updates involves a closer look at the upcoming standalone multiplayer title.\nIn a blog post, Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann reflects on The Last of Us’ legacy as well as the franchise’s future. In addition to the HBO adaptation premiering on January 15 and the PC port of The Last of Us Part 1 hitting in March, Druckmann states fans will learn more about the long-awaited multiplayer experience that serves as a follow-up to the original game’s Factions mode. Druckmann writes,\n“We’ll have some fun surprises for you along the way, but later this year we will begin to offer you some details on our ambitious The Last of Us multiplayer game. With a team led by Vinit Agarwal, Joe Pettinati, and Anthony Newman, the project is shaping up to be a fresh, new experience from our studio, but one rooted in Naughty Dog’s passion for delivering incredible stories, characters, and gameplay.”\nNaughty Dog also shares a new piece of concept art, posted in full below, which is the first new material of the game since it released the first concept asset last June. It depicts two survivors heading toward a dilapidated cruise ship. \nThough we’ll be learning more about the game this year, it’s still unknown if Naughty Dog plans to launch it in 2023. That would be fitting given the anniversary, but we'll have to wait and see over the coming months.

News of this change follows the release of Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance's release last year, which didn't fare too well with critics and players, amidst Larian Studios' continued development on Baldur's Gate 3 (which does not seem to be affected by this reorganization despite WotC serving as the game's publisher). \nThese two games, in part, represented WotC's bigger forray into the video game space as Bloomberg reports that the company had signed contracts with several studios to make games. WotC also \"built at least six of its own game studios,\" according to the publication. \nOne project in the works that is now canceled went under the codename \"Jabberwocky,\" according to Bloomberg, and two more externally developed games early in development are no longer moving forward as well. These cancelations and layoffs comes as parent company Hasbro's shares fell 40% last year. \nWotc told IGN that it remains \"committed to using digital games as a cornerstone of our strategy for bringing our games to players around the world,\" adding that it has \"made some changes to our long-term portfolio to focus on games which are strategically aligned with developing our existing brands and those which show promise in expanding or engaging our audience in new ways.\" \n[Source: Bloomberg]",
