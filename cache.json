          "description": "Train of thought.\nWhen a mystery story has been told millions of times before, how can it still be a mystery? This is the challenge faced by anyone adapting Agatha Christie’s phenomenally widely-read 1934 novel, Murder on the Orient Express. And just in case anyone missed out on the book, decades of film adaptations have also solved the case again and again. This is the challenge taken on by Microids Studio Lyon, as the team packs our bags and stows us away on the legendary locomotive, playing the role of celebrated detective Hercule Poirot.\nMurder on the Orient Express, like the novel, begins in Istanbul, in the grand Tokatlian Hotel. Several of the story’s ensemble cast are introduced in quick succession. Details are kept light and the player is tested on a few key facts about each character to reinforce the basics of who’s who. Since the complex relationships and interactions of figures from different backgrounds are a hallmark of Christie’s mysteries, it’s essential the characters are internalised. Microids, having opted for rote drilling of name, nationality, occupation, and age, have not found the most elegant solution, but it will at least be effective for newcomers while keeping things moving for those already familiar. The game trades the 1930s setting of the novel for the modern day, and with 2023 being the 140th anniversary of the Orient Express itself, there is a perfect excuse for Poirot and his crew of soon-to-be suspects to be stepping aboard.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "\"We are defenders of the night! We are Gargoyles!\".\nBack in the mid-to-late '90s, Disney produced a cartoon called Gargoyles that stood out quite a bit from other shows in the animated landscape. Featuring a serialized storytelling format, rich lore, and a rather dark tone, it quickly gained a cult following across its run, though it never garnered a large enough fanbase that would allow it to blossom into a massive franchise for the House of Mouse.\nAt the height of the show’s popularity, a video game adaptation was produced for the Sega Genesis in the twilight of the fourth generation of game consoles, though it was met with middling reviews and sales. Now that Gargoyles is looking to make a comeback with the recently announced Disney+ show on the way, Disney has seen fit to give this game a re-release as Gargoyles Remastered from Empty Clip Studios. Featuring some new additions like a rewind feature and updated art and music, this revival of a half-forgotten cult classic is an okay outing, but much like other 16-bit Disney titles, it hasn’t aged all that well.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Wonder on 20th October (that's tomorrow!) and it is fair to say that Nintendo has been stepping up the marketing into 'home-straight' territory. We're getting exclusive interviews, comedy short ads, even bus-spotting competitions, but what we haven't seen all that much, is merchandise of the cuddly variety.\nFortunately, it seems that Japanese toy manufacturer, San-ei Boeki, has us covered as an Elephant Mario plushie has just been revealed for a release in January 2024. The plushie was revealed in a tweet from @sanei_NLG, showing that it stands at 26cm tall and has all of the detail that you would expect from the company (remember, this is the team behind a lot of the Pokémon plushies that you can find on the Pokémon Centre online store, so we know that we are in safe hands here).\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

I know Bit.Trip Runner and Choice Provisions’ assorted Bit.Trip rhythm games have been available on Steam for absolutely yonks (and still are, in fact), but my memories of these are all on the Nintendo Wii. That’s where I encountered most of the games firs - and I haven’t really been back since. I dabbled in Runner 2 on the Wii U, but positively bounced off the 3D-ness of Runner 3 when it came to PC, preferring instead the clean, simple lines of its stark pixel sprites. \nIt's with some surprise, then, that I’ve had such a good time with Bit.Trip ReRunner, the recently released fancied up version of the auto-running original that brings its rhythmic courses kicking and screaming into that third dimension. But it’s really more of a compilation game than anything else, packing in extra protein in the form of EP soundtracks and freshly-created course selections from all eight games in the series (mashing tunes from Beat, Core, Void, Fate, Flux into a Runner-style format), as well as lots of new tricks and abilities up its sleeve. But the crown jewel in ReRunner isn’t so much the joy of getting a fresh dose of OG Runner again, but seeing what its player base has already started making with its brilliant Runner Maker level editor. Yep, much like Super Mario Maker before it, Bit.Trip has opened itself up to the whims of would-be game making audience, and they are running with it (sorry).\nRead more",

In other news, the game will no longer crash itself in \"revenge\" when you hit walls too often (a rare, and rather amusing-sounding bug - best be wary when looking for secret rooms I guess). Hexworks have also identified the source of a crashing problem when playing Lords of the Fallen on Steam Deck, though the fix for that particular issue hasn’t yet passed QA.

The amount of comfort I got from playing Alpha Centauri throughout, though, was a surprise.\nIt's less about mere familiarity than you'd think, given how late I first played it. Sid Meier’s Alpha Centauri By Sid Meier endures partly because its design has aged well, but mostly because it's an unusually human 4X strategy. Its high concept story asks for interpretation, for a philosophical response. Where so many others are about the arbitrary icons of nationalism, or stock elves/insectoids/robots, it's a game about ideology and personality. Where a sequel to Civilization's \"send a colony ship into space\" ending could have asked \"what if lasers and aliens\", Alpha Centauri instead asked: Where is humanity going?\nRead more",

          "description": "Space Tales is a new real-time strategy game from Vietnam-based Saigon Dragon, who worked with Numantian Games to develop the brilliant They Are Billions. In They Are Billions, you scraped together walls and turrets to hold off a world's worth of undead, and prolong the miserable lives of a tiny handful of non-zombified humans at your settlement's core. Space Tales is breezier of demeanour - like the confusingly named 2014 RTS Space Rogue, it takes inspiration from 1940s retro-futurism, with brightly coloured maps and chunky chrome unit design. But there are similarly grim overtones. The game puts you in charge of a Starship Troopers-esque expeditionary force, carving out secure nooks on very-much-inhabited alien planets and flogging them as holiday destinations.\r\n\n \nRead more",

In Urbo there are no sky lasers, no oncoming hordes. Nothing. Just dinky little grid-based maps, and an endless stream of tiny adorable buildings to plonk down on them in the pursuit of sweet, sweet point scores.\nThis being a puzzle game, the aim here is to place three buildings of the same type altogether, either in a line or right-angled cluster, at which point they'll all shzooge together to level up to the next building type. This is where the Threes comparison comes in, though you can zhuzh more than three of the same building together if you're smart to earn more points. But it's not quite as simple as that. You see, your buildings will only shoump onto the tile you placed down last, and careful city planners will likely want to think about placing their buildings in reverse so they end up with their fancy new house in the place they actually want it, not in an awkward middle spot that cuts off two precious tiles from play, or awkwardly sits in the middle of another chain of dwellings accidentally. And yep, that's where the Dorfromantik connection comes in, and I really do like it very, very much.\nRead more",

          "description": "It's rare that a developer explicitly introduces their game to you as \"boring\", and Indika seems anything but. Created by Odd Meter, the studio behind the well-received fantasy VR bow simulator Sacralith: The Archer's Tale, and published by Frostpunk developer 11 bit Studios, it's a \"very serious adventure game\" set in 19th century Russia, which casts you as a young Orthodox Christian nun on the run. Awash with doubts about her faith, and persecuted by a mysterious creature, the woman flees her nunnery and falls in with an escaped convict, who tells her of a mysterious \"holy elder\" who might ease her troubles, drawing on the power of a sacred artefact.\nThe game's setting is naturalistic, with motion-captured facial animations and photorealistic buildings and interiors, wrought using Unreal Engine. But it is also a \"fairy tale\" landscape, in the words of studio co-founder Dmitry Setlov, shot through with phantasmagorical flourishes - monochrome or blood-red filters and apparent hallucinations, to say nothing of the aforesaid creature, a skulking mass of tendrils that puts me in mind of the Shadow from Ursula K Le Guin's novel A Wizard Of Earthsea.\nRead more",

The horror manga artist has an immediately recognisable style that intersects detailed, line heavy art with strange and upsetting concepts, and some of his short stories have acquired a sort of semi-memetic status (\"This is my hole! It was made for me!\"). If you're at all familiar with Junji Ito's work you will look at unforgiving almost-text-adventure World Of Horror and go \"Huh, that's inspired by Junji Ito.\"\nThis isn't just because it looks like his work but rendered in MSPaint, or because it contains, just, direct references to it, but because of the whole vibe. You encounter face-sloughing-off kinds of monsters and vengeful spirits inspired by Japanese folkloric yokai, but also weirdo janitors doing stuff like turning the swim team into mermaids in a kind of pervier version of Tusk. At the same time, there's a streak of the Lovecraftian in play to keep it nice and legally distinct, as each self-contained run at the titular world is an attempt to save your town from destruction at the hands of an Old God (they earn the leaden thud of the capital letters). You will fail a lot. But isn't failure part of the fun!? Imagine that enthusiastic question as a big spoonful of marmite popped into your mouth.\nRead more",

On 19th August 1839, a young man opens his eyes to find himself in a vast, silent castle in the forests of Prussia. He discovers a letter from his \"past self\", Daniel, who urges him to murder the castle's secluded owner, a baron named Alexander, and warns that he is being hunted by a monstrous Shadow. 60 years later on New Year's Eve, the celebrated meat factory owner Oswald Mandus starts awake in the opulent stillness of his manor house in London. Hearing the distant voices of his children, he goes to look for them in the \"splendid architectures\" below.\nOn 21st July 1916, at the height of World War I, the soldier Henri Clément stumbles from his sickbed in a colossal bunker beneath the Western Front. With nobody about, and no memory of events during his convalescence, he follows a trail of blood through the collapsing tunnels towards the pantry. And on an unknown day in March 1939, the engineering drafter Tasi Trianon wakes in the wreckage of a plane, deep in the Algerian desert, and enters the nearby caves in search of her husband Salim. Four games, four forgotten pasts, four new beginnings, one descent.\nBeware: major spoilers for the entire Amnesia series below.\nRead more",

It's good, folks, and there's a lot to dig into with its release into early access this week. \nThere's a sizable story campaign and a bunch of side missions already playable here, and its emphasis on stealth and escalating security levels whisked me right back to the good old days of 2015 when I first sat down to play Klei's stealthy masterpiece. There are still a couple of rough edges here and there, but if you've been looking for a strategy RPG with a harder-edge than, say, Mimimi's recently released Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, or just something a bit sneakier than your run of XCOM-likes, Cyber Knights: Flashpoint is definitely worth keeping an augmented eye on.\nRead more",

I myself had to go lie down after seeing Phil in a Phantom Dust shirt. Teaser-shirts, we should have called them. Look at him in the picture up there, showing off a chestful of Hexen. Shameless!\r\n\n\r\nSadly/happily, those halcyon days are behind us, but Phil still loves to dangle the carrot of an ancient IP now and then.

Really, I think it comes down to developer Sledgehammer's decision to mash some of COD's previous triumphs with some of its finest maps.\nDespite COD extending its hand with a warm welcome back, I can't help but feel it's one trembled with nerves.

To help you tell us apart, a point of difference between Goldman and I is that he expressed his love of stupid courage by writing Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid, whereas I express mine by really liking Cyberpunk 2077.\r\n\nStupid courage is a trait that CD Projekt Red's first-person RPG seems to admire, but that's never more clear than in a new ending to the base game added by the Phantom Liberty expansion. It shows what happens when the heroes reject stupid courage and choose self-centred pragmatism instead. Spoilers for Cyberpunk 2077 and Phantom Liberty throughout.\n\n \nRead more",

There was, of course, the Future Of Play booth that our Graham organised for the show (the contents of which you can see right here), but every year the Leftfield Collection houses a couple more custom controller games that are just as illustrative of all the amazing things going on in the world of interactive entertainment these days. \nCase in point, there were two games from this year's cohort that impressed me in equal measure over the weekend - and it was perhaps fitting that they were located directly opposite one another in the Leftfield Collection's long, white corridor. One was a mind-bogglingly complex, almost military-grade-looking briefcase stuffed full of switches, nozzles and buttons, and the other was an impossibly cute cardboard flip book and projector combo that let its cartoon hero Bib bound across the 3D paper environments to find a way home. Here's a little look at both of them in action.\nRead more",

Hermit And Pig is indeed a game about a reclusive old hermit and his truffle-hunting pig, but this charming adventure RPG also has one of the most involving turn-based battle systems I've come across in a while. \nTaking place in first person a la Dragon Quest, Hermit must deal with all sorts of mad and angry wildlife as he hunts for his favourite forest mushrooms, and their scowling (and endearingly daft) expressions are just the tip of this excellent iceberg. For you're not just choosing from a list of moves and watching them play out onscreen. Oh no. Each attack also comes with its own three-button fighting combo, and you'll need to input the right one (often at the right time) to deal the most damage. It's a brilliant system, making Hermit And Pig easily one of this year's highlights from EGX's Leftfield Collection. \nRead more",

          "description": "If you played a videogame at all in 2022, I hope it was Roadwarden. A blend of RPG and visual novel from Polish developer Moral Anxiety, it cast you as lonesome wayfarer maintaining the paths and investigating the mysteries or grievances of a thinly populated wilderness setting. It's a game of immense feeling, craft and cleverness, inspired by table-top games, which puts hoarier ideas about videogame role-playing through the wringer. In the world of Roadwarden, there's no grinding for XP or mindless loot-crafting treadmill. Knowledge, empathy and insight are worth far more than material wealth or wielding the shiniest axe. Quests can hinge on something as minute as your ear for dialects or knowing the correct form of address. And each village along the trail is a world in itself.\r\n\n\r\nMoral Anxiety's Windy Meadow - which actually dates back to before development of Roadwarden, but has been substantially remastered since the latter's release - essentially narrows the focus to one of those villages. Out today, it's a quietly gorgeous visual novel in which you follow several characters in different timeframes, building up a layered understanding of one and the same setting, with scene transitions plotted on a beautiful pixelart map screen.\n Read more",

As explained by Minecraft game director Agnes Larsson, the forthcoming Minecraft update – which has yet to be given a release date – is designed to “focus more on combat adventures and on tinkering” than last year's Cave & Cliffs update.\nThe headline addition is an underground structure called the Trial Chamber, a procedurally generated cluster of traps and treasure rooms, fashioned from copper and tuff blocks and arranged around a central hallway. From the Minecraft Live footage this weekend, Trial Chambers look like an evolution of the game's old buried fortresses, with some nifty new flourishes in the shape of copper bulb blocks that slowly give off less and less light, and new Trial Spawners, which generate a certain number of hostile mobs based on things like the number of players in your party.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The EGX demo for magic school adventure Leximan was perhaps only ten minutes long, but that's all it really needed to confirm that this wordy spell-caster is a riotous delight of a thing that should absolutely be on your radar. Built out of a game jam prototype from 2020, Leximan casts you (sorry) as a would-be wizard who's struggling to make an impact compared to his more verbally proficient schoolmates. In this particular demo, he's woken by a friend to go and assist the school cook with preparing breakfast, but things go horribly awry when a pesky fire elemental turns up to spoil it all.\nRead more",

          "description": "I'll admit I've been a bit sceptical of Loco Motive since it was first announced a little while ago. Any point and click adventure game that makes a bid trying to be funny like the good old days has a very real chance of being painfully unfunny in my experience (looking at you, Deponia), and I was worried that Loco Motive would fall into the same try-hard pile as other so-called comedy adventures that have come out recently (see also Turnip Boy - yeah, I went there, fight me). But having played a timed 20-minute demo of it at this year's EGX, I'll hold my hands up and say, yep, I'm the one who's been slapped in the face with a giant custard pie here, as Loco Motive is genuinely really quite good, folks, and I'm pleased to report the good old days are still very much alive and kicking. Well, except poor old Lady Unterwald, who carks it within seconds of the game starting, and whose murder you end up getting framed for.\nRead more",

Whether it's in my own, real-life home or in a game, I am compelled to scrub, wipe and tidy - and the oily, purple globs of gunk clogging up Loddlenaut's appropriately named region of Flotsam Flats are just begging to be zapped by my little diver's handy laser gun. With just a single squeeze of the trigger, he sets to work, moving his arm automatically to neatly attack each neighbouring blob without any further prompting or manual aiming. All I need to focus on is getting him close enough to the gunge and he'll take care of the rest. Sure, it's perhaps not quite as involved as your PowerWash Sims and other polish em ups, but the combination of Loddlenaut's lo-fi visuals, comforting score and surprisingly soothing controller rumble all work to give it its own kind of zen-like charm - and it was enough to make me forget the surrounding din of the EGX Rezzed Zone for a very enjoyable 20 minutes or so.\nRead more",

He’s not alone on his journey either. As well as his mates from the first LAD, plus lots more newcomers, mainline Yakuza stablemate Kazuma Kiryu, now extra frosty with his silver hairdo, is also coming along for the ride as well. \nAlas, the circumstances in which the two join forces wasn’t covered in my 30-minute demo at this year’s EGX. Rather, we pick up Ichiban, Kiryu and fresh faces Chitose and Tomizawa as they land in Honolulu, in search of a dodgy cop named Roman who's managed to wrong almost everyone in the group at some point in the past. 30 minutes isn’t long in a game like Yakuza, but hey, I still got to screech at restaurant goers in one of its sidequest stories, as well as terrorise the general public on Ichiban’s always-deployable segway, which I’d still call a pretty strong introduction to this latest LAD.\nRead more",

This spooky lantern might open up some cool realm-hopping twists on your grim adventure, and the game as a whole might instil a sense of exploration sure to please souls fans after a familiar hit of uncertain peril, but its finer details chip away at your patience. It's not long before your tentative pushes through horrible towns and creaky walkways soon give way to wild sprint finishes born from pure frustration.\nRead more",

          "description": "Whereas most games begin by getting you into the action as quickly as possible, Saltsea Chronicles opens with a quick note about its save system. It's a small, but important detail in this story-driven adventure game, as throughout its nine-to-ten-hour run time, you'll be faced with various decisions about where your crew of post-apocalyptic drifters will explore next, as they set sail in search of their missing captain Maja. By choosing one island at the end of every chapter, you'll naturally miss out on visiting another - and with 14 locales to explore in total in the Saltsea archipelago (and only 12 chapters to do it in), each playthrough has the potential to end up being quite different from the last.\nBut up front it tells you \"There are no wrong choices, only your choices\" in Saltsea Chronicles, and that ultimately this is a tale about \"tracing different pathways\" using its clever branching save system. While you can, of course, play it through from start to finish in a single swoop, you also have the option to purloin its additional save slots to take those roads less travelled (presented here as delightful, wiggling seaweed tendrils), and all without overwriting your existing adventure. Immediately, that sense of FOMO is dispelled, and instead of worrying about 'seeing everything' or making sure you get a 'good' playthrough, you can simply enjoy its enthralling tale of high seas soap opera, curious exploration, and the knotty drama that comes with trying to forge connections in an increasingly fragmented world. It's a journey well worth taking, even if what lies at the end of it didn't quite come together in the way I'd hoped.\nRead more",

This wireless mouse is an all-time favourite for me, as it combines a simple and relatively lightweight design with bulletproof wireless and an incredible modding community that have turned this mouse into the basis for hundreds of other designs. \nAs you might have guessed from the category and the title of this post, the G305 Lightspeed normally costs $50, but today it's down to $35 at Amazon for Prime Big Deal Days.\nRead more",

Amongst other things, Kotick allegedly discussed machine learning, Guitar Hero and the apocalyptic power of Microsoft R&D. Activision hired James Corden to host the meeting, the sources claim.

          "description": "Ara: History Untold's headline gimmick is actually a couple of centuries old. In this deceptively Civilization-esque 4X strategy game, all player turns unfold simultaneously, once you've decided what to build or research, where to move your units, and so on. As Oxide Games design director Michelle Menard tells me over Zoom, this approach takes inspiration from an ancient military simulator, Kriegsspiel, which was devised by the Prussian army officer George Leopold von Reisswitz, aka the \"father of wargaming\", in the mid-1800s. \r\n\n\r\n\"It was to train their generals, it was a legit apparatus of war, it was not for funsies,\" says Menard. \"And they basically created this massive table that had a modular terrain system. At first they used sand, but that was kind of messy, [and so] they developed a system where they had interchangeable tiles, like hills and valleys and plateaus. \r\n\n\r\n\"They would build out this table, literally drop a sheet down the middle, and it'd be like, OK, you guys on each side, you can't see what the other person's doing. There was an actual game master, who was the referee who you would report your moves to. He would then re-set up the board and basically call people back into the room and be like, tada! It's the next turn - let's see what people did. Was it what you expected?\" \r\n\n \nRead more",

The G413 SE employs the bumpy 'tactile' style of mech switches, so it’s good for accurate typing, and it’s easily fast and agile enough for gaming duty as well. I actually ended up using this as my main keyboard for a while, despite having more expensive linear-switch boards piled up in a nearby cupboard, and I’d extra-extra-recommend it at this price.\r\n\n \nRead more",

From October 19 until October 22, all Xbox members, even those without Game Pass, have access to a 10-hour gameplay trial. This makes Diablo 4 the first Timed Trial game that is part of Free Play Days, but honestly, it comes at a great time. Season 2 of Diablo 4 is a lot of fun and is a great opportunity for prospective players to have a fun Action RPG experience over the weekend. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like a similar option is available for PC or PlayStation.\n\n\n\n\nFor those with Xbox Game Pass Core or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, you'll also have access to NBA 2K24, Lawn Mowing Simulator, and Hokko Life during this Free Play Days event. As always, your progress across all of these titles, including the Diablo 4 trial, is saved. So, if you do end up deciding to purchase the game after the event, or even at a later date, you will be able to pick up where you left off.\n\n\nAlongside the 10-hour trial, Diablo 4 is also on sale for 25% through November 1. Altogether this is a great chance to try out the game and if it tickles your fancy, you can purchase it at its lowest price yet. 10 hours is plenty of time to know if you are going to like what Diablo 4 has to offer.\n\n\nDiablo 4 Season 2 is live now on all platforms.\n\nThe post Diablo 4 has a free 10-hour trial on Xbox this weekend appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Paradox Interactive has announced the next Stellaris expansion, titled Astral Planes. The new narrative-focused expansion will allow players to wield reality-breaking technologies to explore alternate dimensions. In these parallel universes, players will encounter new creatures and phenomena as they journey into the true unknown. There was no specific release date given for Astral Planes, but the release does say it is coming to PC later this year.\n\n\n\n\nThe story-centric expansion will feature branching narratives, a first for Stellaris. Players can navigate a branching narrative built specifically to make choices matter. According to Paradox, Astral Planes will be full of surprises and hard choices. Decisions will not only affect the narrative but also shape the player's empire to fit their playstyle.\n\n\nIn terms of gameplay features, Astral Planes will feature new Technologies, Actions, and Relics, which is pretty par for the course for this type of expansion. It also appears there is a new Origin called Riftworld. \n\n\nStellaris is my favorite Grand Strategy game, so any new content looks good to me. But depending on how the Astral Planes actually works, this could set the 4X title up for even more content avenues in the future.\n\n\nStellaris: Astral Planes will be released on PC later this year.\n\nThe post Stellaris: Astral Planes will open alternate dimensions later this year appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "As part of DreadXP’s Indie Horror Showcase, Philisophic Games has pulled back the curtain on Hellpunk, a horror game about hitting things with things.\n\n\nI’ve got a dearth of information here, but Hellpunk seems to be a game trying to nail the ever-elusive feeling of melee combat in a first-person game. It uses somewhat lo-fi graphics, and all the press material I have just says it’s about angrily killing foes. The foes consist of CRT-headed dudes and other assorted weirdos. Don’t worry about creating CRT-headed orphans, however, because apparently, you’re fighting “through the depths of the human mind.” The very angry depths.\n\n\n\n\nTo be fair, though, the short, 22-second trailer says a lot. Beyond the trippy visuals, first-person melee is a carrot that few have even touched. 2005’s Condemned: Criminal Origins is often cited as one of the few games to even come close to making it work. I’m currently straining to think of another game that did it well following that. Doom (2016)’s glory kills come to mind, but it’s just hitting a button and watching Doomguy be all vicious. That really doesn’t count.\n\n\nSo, yeah, that’s all I got, aside from the fact that it calls itself “Murder-punk.” We’ll have to wait and see if Hellpunk manages to achieve what has been lost.\n\n\nHellpunk is coming to PC via Steam. Its page is available to wishlist, but there is no target release window.\n\nThe post First-person melee horror Hellpunk revealed in very brief trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Nightdive Studios has shown off their upcoming remaster, System Shock 2: Enhanced Edition, at the indie horror showcase. This updated version transplants the 1999 classic to the KEX Engine, bringing with it all the modern comforts that the engine offers.\n\n\nNightdive has really been moving on these remasters. Star Wars: Dark Forces was just recently announced along with Turok 3, while SiN Reloaded got shunted a bit to the side to make room. System Shock 2: Enhanced Edition has been in the pipeline for a while, however, with it being promised to anyone who pre-ordered the System Shock remaster.\n\n\n\n\nThe Enhanced Edition comes with the added benefit of higher resolution, widescreen, and post-processing effects. The graphics have also been touched up, but in typical Nightdive fashion, they’re carefully tweaked to improve the look without altering the gameplay. It will also be available on consoles for the first time.\n\n\nSystem Shock 2 was the first game from Irrational Games and was a sequel to Looking Glass Studios’ 1994 title, System Shock. The title is held in high regard, and its design would influence its spiritual successor, 2007’s Bioshock. I’m sure some fans will be disappointed that Nightdive didn’t completely overhaul the 1999 title in the same way they did the original System Shock, but of the two titles, the latter definitely needed a lick of paint.\n\n\nThere’s still no release date for System Shock 2: Enhanced Edition aside from “coming soon” and “in the near future.” It will be coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.\n\nThe post Nightdive shows off System Shock 2: Enhanced Edition at Indie Horror Showcase appeared first on Destructoid.",

Nintendo now has a listing for the \"Super Mario Bros. Wonder Double Keychain,\" which features Mario in his normal and elephant forms (hence the \"double\"). It's a little strange having Mario and his presumed doppelganger on there instead of another character, but what are you gonna do: he sells merch!\n\n\nMario rewards typically go fast, but at 800 Platinum Points, you'll want to sit and think on this one for a while. Here's a bit more info on the 5\"x 6\" reward to help you decide: \"It also comes with a colorful strap that shows off the new Elephant Fruit, Drill Mushroom, Wonder Flower and Wonder Seed.\"\n\n\nWhat other recent My Nintendo rewards are there?\n\n\nIf you have the sinking feeling that there was a recently announced but yet-to-be-released My Nintendo reward: there is! It's none other than the Detective Pikachu coffee cozy, representing a game that kind of came and went from our collective consciousness. We'll update you when it launches!\n\n\nAs a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time.

The update also includes various limited time events lasting until November 1.\n\n\n\n\nUrek Mazino (SSR+ [Flight]) and Endorsi (SSR [Child]) join the game in this Halloween update. In fact, the new story content, dubbed “Endorsi and the October Illusion,” is an original event dealing with Endorsi being bullied by her sisters. There’s also an event mission and illusion event exchange shop for October, where players can earn a new outfit for SSR Xia Xia. \n\n\nIn addition, alternative costumes for Yuri, Rachel, and Lozeal are also available.\n\n\nIt’d seem the only event that’s not set to expire at the end of the month is a welcome back boost where players can earn a variety of rewards simply by playing the game and completing missions every day for seven days in a row. This event is currently ongoing with no projected end date.\n\n\nTower of God: New World released for Android and iOS devices (with a PC version available via Google Play Games Beta) this July. The mobile game follows the story of the acclaimed webtoon and anime adaptation, the latter of which premiered in 2020, as part of the Crunchyroll Originals branding.

          "description": "Marvel's Spider-Man didn't include the option to replay the story in New Game Plus mode when it first launched in 2018. But Insomniac wasn't lazing about in a hammock made of webbing, either. The developer launched the feature roughly six weeks after launch. Is it coming to the sequel? Oh yes, and now we (roughly) know when: before the end of this year.\n\n\nNew Game Plus (NG+) won't be alone on missing release, as Spider-Man 2 is also getting updated with a mission replay feature too. This update flew a bit under our radar, but like any wily city pigeon, we eventually caught it. Within the replies to Insomniac's announcement of a game up on Twitter/X, the company's community director was hashing out what's coming to Spider-Man 2 post-launch. The director in question, James Stevenson, mentioned New Game Plus mode will release for Spider-Man 2 \"before [the] end of [the] year.\" \n\n\n\n\n\nWill New Game Plus and mission replay release for Spider-Man 2 at the same time?\n\n\nThe bonus to the news is that the NG+ mode isn't coming to the game alone. Spider-Man 2 will get a mission replay feature, according to Stevenson. It's not confirmed that it'll arrive alongside New Game Plus, however. In a reply, Stevenson wrote that the team is \"working on an update for those features,\" including NG+, \"but they won't be in Day 1.\" He later clarifies when NG+ is expected to drop, but isn't specific about mission replay.\n\n\n\n\n\nEither way, it should be exciting for Spider-Man 2 fans who dream of knocking out early-game bosses while fully kitted out. The NG+ update for the original game included two more trophies: 'One More Time' got awarded for playing the game again in NG+, and 'Power and Responsibility' was earned after beating the game in Ultimate difficulty. And yes, you could acquire the latter trophy in NG+.\n\n\nMarvel's Spider-Man 2 launches on PlayStation 5 on October 20.\n\nThe post Spider-Man 2 will get New Game Plus before the end of the year appeared first on Destructoid.",

What’s exciting about that (besides the obvious)? Well, one of the skins you can unlock for it is none other than Samhain. If you aren’t hip to my jive, Samhain is one of the most beloved villains of The Real Ghostbusters cartoon. He was featured in one of the best episodes of the first season and then appeared multiple times throughout the rest of the show’s run. Despite being shown in the intro of Extreme Ghostbusters, he never actually appeared in the show proper, unfortunately.\n\n\nAside from that bit of…",

          "description": "As discovered by Liliputing and picked up by The Verge, a handheld PC company is toying with a rather familiar-looking screen configuration for one of their upcoming products: the Ayaneo Flip DS and its sibling, the Ayaneo Flip KB. The KB just flips open to a mini-keyboard, while the DS has an upper and lower screen, similar to a particularly well-known line of Nintendo handhelds.\n\n\nThe handheld PCs are both powered by an AMD Ryzen 7 7840U CPU and Radeon 780M integrated graphics. They have a primary display size of 7 inches and a refresh rate of 120hz. That’s all that has really been “leaked” by Ayaneo, and I emphasize those quotes because Liliputing does.\n\n\nCall me short of imagination, but I have no idea what else you’d use the second screen for. To show a slideshow of your anime waifus while you play Doom (2016)? I’m fairly certain that it’s intended for the crowd looking to emulate Nintendo DS games, which I find funny because I think the best platform to emulate Nintendo DS games is a Nintendo DS. It has the form factor and screen resolution and everything. They’re also super cheap. They just don’t let you play modern PC games, so I guess if you’re short on pocket space…\n\n\nHowever, I feel like pointing out that it won’t be a very good DS surrogate unless that second screen is a touch display. Try playing Freshly-Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland without one. I feel like, given its obvious purpose, it has to be, but that hasn't been confirmed. \n\n\nMeanwhile, The Verge reporter Sean Hollister sounds practically exasperated with Ayaneo’s hijinks. They say: “The company also announces new designs faster than it can ship them — by the time I’ve received one of the company’s products for testing, it’s almost always already moved on to a newer, more desirable model.”\n\n\nThe isn’t for me, but it might be for you. I, on the other hand, have a sudden desire to play Freshly-Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland again.\n\nThe post New handheld PC looks perfect for DS games, with some potential caveats appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s the Whiteout update, also known as update 1.7.0, a festive little addition that will get you into the holiday spirit if you haven’t accepted it into your heart already.\n\n\nThe Whiteout update is absolutely free (Merry Crimbo) and available now. It comes with all the holiday fixings:\n\n\n\n6 new EXTRA achievements\n\n\n1 new bonus stage\n\n\n2 new relics to get a new PowerUp and morph an existing character\n\n\n1 new weapon with its evolution\n\n\n1 new playable character\n\n\n1 new music track\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks, Santa! Meanwhile, there’s a tongue-in-cheek trailer to watch that will remind you that big department stores have been celebrating the Birth of Christ since July. “If big named stores can do it, why can’t we??” shouts the trailer—damned right.\n\n\nAs a reminder, I was the one who performed the sacrifice and conjured a review for Vampire Survivors after its Switch release. As a warning, it’s designed by a former gambling guy to be as addictive as possible. On the other hand, it’s innocuous in the way that there is a general endpoint to the game, and it won’t keep asking for your money. Aside from a couple of DLC packs, there are no microtransactions. The only thing you’re risking is a relentless impulse to chase a rush of endorphins. But let’s be honest, social media has probably already conditioned you that way.\n\n\nHappy Holidays!\n\n\nVampire Survivors is available PC, console, and mobile.

The audio dramas are available with Japanese audio, but there will be a link to an English translation PDF that fans can refer to. In addition, the soundtrack will feature 19 tracks found across the game’s world. Interested players can pre-order the limited edition on October 25 at 10 a.m. PDT / 12 p.m. CST / 1 p.m. EST. \n\n\n\n\nMy Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom -Pirates of the Disturbance- continues the story as told in the anime and follows Catarina Claes, reincarnated in the world of an otome game called Fortune Lover as the game’s doomed villainess. \n\n\nIn this next chapter, Catarina and her brother Keith are set to board a luxury liner called the Vinculum when it’s attacked by pirates. It’s then she remembers these incredibly familiar events sound oddly like a fanbook for Fortune Lover. \n\n\nThis expansion to the anime series is set for release on November 28 exclusively for the Nintendo Switch.\n\nThe post Here’s what’s included in the limited edition of My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom -Pirates of the Disturbance- appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Speedrunning events like Games Done Quick are a chance for people to break world records, while also raising money for charity. It was announced recently that Awesome Games Done Quick will be an in-person event. On top of that, the event will also see its first non-human combatant.\n\n\nThat's right, according to speedrunner and streamer JSR_, AGDQ 2024 represents the first time a dog will officially participate in speedrunning on this level. A trailer video shows that Peanut Butter, the Shiba Inu owned by JSR_, will be there to see if they can break their personal best.\n\n\n\n\nWhat game will they be playing? According to a post on Twitter, Peanut Butter (sometimes referred to as PB) will be running the 1985 NES game Gyromite.\n\n\nNot their first rodeo\n\n\nWhile JSR_ will be assisting PB to some extent, game inputs will be conducted solely by the dog. A video from earlier this year shows they've done this before, making it through the game in 25:29. The basic set-up utilizes a series of colored buttons hooked up to the game, which Peanut Butter activates (for treats, of course).\n\n\nInterestingly, both JSR_ and PB are up on Speedrun.com under their own category: Game B - Dog Assistance. The schedule on the AGDQ website shows that this will be an online run rather than in-person, with an expected time of 30 minutes.\n\n\nWe can already see that Peanut Butter seems to have got down the specifics of Gyromite. Yes, I'm aware that they probably don't fully understand what's happening, but who among us isn't the least bit tempted to watch a dog play video games? AGDQ will be going ahead in January.\n\nThe post For the first time ever, Games Done Quick will have a canine speedrunner appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "In the run-up to the end of October, many horror studios are getting some content ready for this most spookiest of seasons. One such example comes from Amnesia: The Bunker developer Frictional Games, and a new video outlines the custom settings coming in a soon-to-be-released update.\n\n\nOver on the Frictional YouTube channel, creative lead Fredrik Olsson showcases the new \"Custom Settings\" mode that's coming to the latest Amnesia game.\n\n\n\n\nAs you'll see in the footage, there are a series of parameters that can be played with so you can set the game's difficulty however you want. For example: you can set it so that every time you save, fuel is used up. You can even disable saving all together. Or maybe you want to make things easier by extending how long the torch stays lit or the amount of resources there are.\n\n\nMore to come in this WW1 nightmare\n\n\nThis is all going to be part of the new update which, according to the video, is expected to roll out soon. However, given that it's being referred to as the \"Halloween update,\" we can already take a guess at roughly when it'll be available.\n\n\nAlong with custom settings, the Amnesia: The Bunker patch will also come with the option to hone your skills in the Training Grounds. This will allow you to have a little practice at firing your gun or throwing grenades, right before you dive on into the horror of the titular bunker.\n\n\nThere's also the new 'shell shocked' difficulty, which aims to make the game even harder. Because when you're hiding in the dark from a terrifying monster, what most of us are thinking is, \"hmm, I wish this was somehow more stressful.\"\n\nThe post Amnesia: The Bunker’s new custom settings gives you flexibility with your horror appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you even keep just a tiny watch on the video game world, you won't be shocked to learn that Starfield has been quite the big deal. As of September, Bethesda's epic sci-fi RPG was the top ranking game in the US in terms of sales.\n\n\nThat's according to a chart uploaded by Circana analyst Mat Piscatella on Twitter. The image gives a rundown of the twenty best-selling games in the US market between the end of August and September 30. Starfield sits comfortably at the top, while new entries such as Mortal Kombat 1 and EA Sports FC 24 are at the number two and number three positions, respectfully.\n\n\n\n\nThe figures include both physical and digital copies of the games across all major platforms. As an aside, it's interesting to see Resident Evil 4 jump up from 27th to 12th place, but that's almost certainly because of the recent Separate Ways DLC.\n\n\nAnd for those trying to spot Baldur's Gate 3 on the list, Piscatella clarified that digital sales of the RPG aren't reflected in the list, as \"Larian Studios is not a panel member.\"\n\n\nIt won't last forever, though\n\n\nOf course, no one's surprised to see Starfield at the top. The game was hyped up for quite some time and with no sign of The Elder Scrolls 6, this was all Bethesda fans had to look forward to.\n\n\nHowever, things have definitely gone a bit quiet for the game. In fact, if you take a look at the Top Sellers list on Steam, you can see that – at the time of writing – Starfield is now at number 35, having taken quite a drop recently. It's even below the Special Edition of Skyrim, which goes to show how much staying power TES5 has.\n\n\nThese trends are to be expected, though. As much as Todd Howard and his team would love people to be playing Starfield for many years to come, we can expect to see interest wane as time goes on. That's just the way it is for most releases.\n\nThe post Unsurprisingly, Starfield was the best-selling game in the US for September appeared first on Destructoid.",

It was another “darker” Saturday morning cartoon that came about in the wake of Batman: The Animated Series’ success. In fact, the first season was penned by writers from that series. It was the thing at the time. What I remember liking best about Gargoyles was the comfortable feeling of danger and tension that was unique to this particular brand of cartoon.\n\n\nI’m actually more familiar with the 1995 Sega Genesis game based on the property, which, as it turns out, isn’t entirely faithful. It’s also not very good. It’s okay at best. So, it’s interesting to see Disney revisit the title, though it’s likely got a lot to do with the planned Disney+ live-action adaptation.

Since the headset launched, modders have been attempting to change this, and it appears that a significant breakthrough has been made. \n\n\n\n\nMediator Software revealed that it has gotten the PS VR2 to work in SteamVR. Currently, it only works under a narrow set of conditions. It is AMD-only and it requires DP-AUX emulator hardware. You'll also require a VirtualLink port on the GPU or the BizLink VirtualLink adapter.\n\n\nThe modders have experience with VR, as they're the creators of iVRy Driver, an app that lets you use your iPhone, Android, GearVR, Oculus Mobile, or Sony PSVR headset as a Virtual Reality Headset for your PC. They have revealed that they have had a tough time with the PS VR2, describing it as the \"first consumer VR headset that needed a hardware 'hack' to make it work on a PC.\"\n\n\nThis isn't the only project Mediator Software is busy with. It is also attempting the ambitious task of getting streaming headsets to work on the PS5.

          "description": "Do you ever wonder what it would be like if someone commented on every decision you made in Mario? Well, according to a recent Super Mario Bros. Wonder developer interview, the idea of live commentary was tested for the game. \n\n\nTakashi Tezuka, a producer on Wonder, asked the game's programming director, Shiro Mouri, about the concept during the game's development. From there, the team \"actually spent about six months seriously developing live commentary,\" according to Nintendo's Koichi Hayashida, in hopes of adding voices that matched the player's actions.\n\n\nDuring development, a generic \"newscaster\" voice and a \"Tsundere\" option were entertained. A Japanese adjective, Tsundere is usually attributed towards a person or personality that's cold and harsh with glimpses of affection. Popular …",

          "description": "It’s almost time to swing back to the streets of New York City in Marvel’s Spider-Man 2. But, before we do, developer Insomniac Games is encouraging players to download the day one patch.\n\n\n\n\nIn an image post made via Twitter, the developer confirms the entire game is present on the disc for physical players, and is fully playable without the need of a patch. But, “for the best experience, we highly encourage physical/disc-based players to download update Version 1.001.002 on launch day — prior to experiencing the opening mission of the game for the first time.”\n\n\nThe studio went on to explain the day one patch — which serves to add “polish to the gold master version” of the game’s physical edition — will be auto-loaded for any digital players who pre-load the game. In addition to polish, the day one patch “improves the opening sections of the game” and adds accessibility options, according to Insomniac.\n\n\nMarvel’s Spider-Man 2 is set to continue where its predecessors left off, allowing players to explore an expanded NYC as they fight both new and existing villains such as Venom, Kraven the Hunter, and Lizard. It looks pretty good, judging by our own review from Chris Carter where it received a 9. It is set for release on October 20 exclusively for the PlayStation 5.\n\nThe post Insomniac encourages Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 players to download day one patch appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "CD Projekt RED is following through on its promise to stop official support for Gwent this year, but not before releasing one last update. The company announced on Gwent's website that a final update is coming, but the card game's future isn't ending.\n\n\nAlongside the balance update is the inclusion of \"Gwentfinity,\" which hands balance to the player base. The feature's announcement came last year alongside Gwent's sunsetting, so it's something fans have expected. \n\n\n\n\nNot all of Gwent will be in players' hands, as CD Projekt Red is employing a skeleton team to manage its infrastructure. This will ensure the game remains operational while keeping players generally in control.\n\n\nHow balance changes will work going forward is with the community-run Balance Council. Becoming a member involves being at Prestige 1 and Pro Rank for the season or winning 25 games in the season. These restrictions are to ensure eligible voters are community members deeply familiar with Gwent's meta.\n\n\nBalance Council members will get to participate in monthly votes that potentially change a set number of cards. Restrictions include voting for up to three cards within certain brackets to ensure changes without breaking the game.\n\n\nBeyond the newfound community control and some oversight from CD Projekt Red, Gwent will no longer see any new cards. This means any changes will be made with cards already implemented within the game.\n\n\nGwent's last update comes not too long after CD Projekt Red announced it is laying off around nine percent of its staff. Hopefully, all affected can find new workplaces and any remaining staff can effectively manage Gwent's community.\n\nThe post Gwent is releasing its final developer update, and handing balance to its players appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Capcom has released the second big update for their robot-powered dinosaur murder game, Exoprimal. Among the added features are the anticipated Street Fighter crossover skins.\n\n\nDo you remember Exoprimal? It’s the game that everyone thought might be a new Dino Crisis when it was first announced, but then it turned out to be a live service multiplayer title. It’s actually pretty good! But pretty good is sort of a bad place to be in the live service market where most of the pie is being greedily gobbled up by a few of the most popular games. It’s an extremely over-the-top game about killing interdimensional robots that come pouring out of portals while also trying to beat another team at being the best dino killers.\n\n\nImage via Capcom\n\n\nThe update includes some great stuff alongside the Street Fighter skins. There’s a new map called Ocean Platform that takes place on a platform out in an ocean. Also added is a new Final Mission alongside it called Escape. There are two new rigs, Edge Strike and Drone. Two new modules are getting thrown into the mix. Finally, there are a bunch of new rewards, balance changes, and bug fixes. You can check them out over here.\n\n\nI’m curious to know what the player population is like with Exoprimal. Did it find its audience? Let’s see. The average player count for the last 30 days on Steam is 89.9. Eesh. At least there’s crossplay.\n\n\nExoprimal is available on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.

          "description": "RedDeer.Games has announced they’re handling the console publishing of MGP Studios and Solid9 Studios’ Project Downfall, a neon-drenched first-person shooter with shades of Hotline Miami. It’s coming to Switch in November, followed by Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S sometime later. Sorry, PlayStation fans.\n\n\nProject Downfall is a psychedelic shooter that leans heavily on Hotline Miami while transplanting its gameplay to a first-person perspective. It’s heavily about slow-motion takedowns of groups of enemies, swapping weapons frequently, and throwing the ones you’re finished using to buy yourself some time. Your character is a wealthy businessman with a chip on their shoulder and a thirst for blood. There’s actually a plot buried beneath all the action involving global politics, but I’m fairly certain the protagonist cares little about that and just wants to perforate thugs.\n\n\n\n\nI played Project Downfall this past January but only got through about an hour-and-a-half with it. I remember parting with it on bad terms, but for the life of me, I can’t remember why. I recall being a bit perturbed by how similar the narrative was to Hotline Miami, but I think I had an issue with the gameplay, as well. I just don’t remember what specifically.\n\n\nIf you do manage to make it through, there are 12 different endings for you to get depending on the choices you make throughout the game. Weirdly, the one new feature they tout for the console version is “a completely redesigned lighting system for Nintendo Switch.” Woo!\n\n\nProject Downfall is currently available for PC. The Switch version will be released in November followed by Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S sometime after that.\n\nThe post Trippy FPS Project Downfall is coming to consoles starting with Switch in November appeared first on Destructoid.",

So, imagine my surprise when it turns out that someone has managed to take the aforementioned titles and package them under one roof. Kind of.\n\n\nIf you've always wanted to know what Doom 2 would be like with Half-Life's sound effects, then ModDB user DASniperIC (thanks, PCGamesN) has just the thing for you.\n\n\n\n\nIf you want an idea of what it sounds like when the enemies of one game cry out like injured scientists in the other, the footage gives you a taste. Not only does the mod replace the enemy howls and roars with things like Black Mesa scientists, but all the weapons now sound like they come from Valve's IP, too.\n\n\nImps as headcrab zombies...what a world!\n\n\nAs DASniperIC says, it's entirely possible someone else has tackled the concept already. However, this version is simply their take on a Doom/Half-Life crossover.\n\n\nIt's one of a gazillion ways that these legendary shooters continue to get the modding treatment and thus remain in the gaming limelight. Classic Doom is certainly no stranger to mods, having spent the better part of three decades receiving tweaks and custom options from its community. \n\n\nAs for Half-Life, well, that's still getting a lot of love these days, even more so the sequel. In any case, modding legendary FPS games shows no signs of slowing down. Maybe someone will combine Doom with another game from a bygone era, like Blood. Oh, wait.

It functions both as a great parody of anime characters who are constantly struggling to become stronger and as great action anime on its own. As a video game, however, it struggles somewhat as Saitama must defeat everyone in one punch, which isn't particularly fun gameplay, forcing you to play as the many other characters of the franchise, who sadly aren't Saitama.\nOne Punch Man: World is currently in closed beta and while it doesn't particularly solve any of those issues, it does look great and showcase some impressive action. It is a free-to-play game, though, which means there are gacha mechanics and lots of different currencies to deal with.

We loved it – read Game Informer's review of it here – and are excited for everyone to get their hands on it. Yesterday, we learned Insomniac Games recommends players download the day one patch for the \"best experience\" before starting the first mission, and now, we've learned when to expect the fan-favorite New Game Plus feature in the sequel. \nAs first reported by PlayStation Lifestyle, someone asked Insomniac Games community director James Stevenson if New Game Plus and mission replay will be in the game at launch. Stevenson said, \"No, we're working on an update for those features but they won't be in Day 1.\"\nNo - we’re working on an update for those features but they won’t be in Day 1\nOctober 17, 2023\nAfter someone on Twitter expressed their disappointment in the replies, Stevenson clarified that New Game Plus was not a Day 1 feature in the original Marvel's Spider-Man, but instead a mode added roughly six weeks after launch. \nSomeone else asked Stevenson on Twitter if New Game Plus is coming this year or 2024 and Stevenson said it \"should be before end of year.\"\nShould be before end of year\nOctober 18, 2023\nSo if you're looking forward to replaying the story of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 with all of your favorite suits, gadgets, abilities, and more unlocked from the jump, it sounds like it could be just a month or two away. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 review and then read about the Marvel's Spider-Man 2 Day 1 patch.

It was an early instance of a fully modeled 3D location, and its use of FMV actors for its cast felt like you were looking into the future of video games. It received a few underwhelming sequels and other adaptions, but The 7th Guest VR marks arguably its biggest and boldest reimagining. Effectively a remake, this version of the game takes the familiar locations and story and adds in new puzzles and new performances. Considering the original game (and this remake) is about exploring a spooky house and solving puzzles, it feels at home in VR. You can watch Wes LeBlanc and me check out the game below.\nFor a whole lot more on The 7th Guest, you can read our oral history of the game right here. You can also take a look at this translated interview between Mario and Zelda creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, and Spirited Away director, Hayao Miyazaki, from the early 90s where Miyamoto called the game \"inspiring\".\n\n\nHead over to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

It did so for several reasons – its beautifully realized visuals, top-notch voice acting, and, of course, the potential to play as some of my favorite characters in a Metroidvania-esque adventure. That wasn't all, though; The snippets of composer David Housden's score in the reveal trailer indicated this team was on to something. \nIt was clear from the first listen that Housden and Dlala put a lot of effort into making Illusion Island sound like Disney. What's more, it replicated not just the broader stroke that anyone can hear and go, \"Oh, that sounds like Disney music,\" but instead created something wholly original that simultaneously sounded…",

Now, Analogue is targeting the Nintendo 64 catalog with its next device, the Analogue 3D. \nAnalogue has shared an image of what appears to be the device, although the full look at it is obscured. You can view it at the top of the article, but it's below as well:\nAn image released alongside today's news teases what appears to be a sleek, black, and faithful recreation of the Nintendo 64 controller. You can check it out below: \nAnalogue says the 3D device will feature 4K HDMI output, its proprietary Analogue OS, wireless Bluetooth, and 2.4G Wi-Fi. It will also have \"4 original-style controller ports,\" presumably so that players can use their original Nintendo 64 controllers with the 3D. The company says the 3D's 4K output allowed \"us to created incomprehensibly profound Original Display Modes,\" and that in collaboration with 8BitDo, it will release a wireless controller for the device. \nAnalogue didn't share more, but the 3D is set to release some time in 2024. Preorders are not yet open, but if it's like the Pocket release, preorders will happen well before the actual release (and if you want one, plan on preordering because the Pockets sold out immediately). \n\nWhile waiting to learn more, read Game Informer's Analogue Pocket review. \nAre you excited about the Analogue 3D?

Join us as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign.  \nAfter 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.\nJoin editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up. \nPart 1 - Surpr-iced! \nPart 2 - Bringing The Smoke\nPart 3 - Staff Meeting\nPart 4 - My Life As A Lin Kuei Robot\nFinale - Waking the Dragons\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

Unfortunately, co-op is restricted to local play. Living alone and working remotely makes couch co-op a tricky proposition, and the only way for me to test this is by using the PS5’s Share Play feature with another editor, but that feature won’t work until the game launches next Tuesday. Until I can get a sense of what it’s like to take down badniks with another person, my general thoughts on Sonic Superstars is that if you’re looking for a Genesis-era throwback, Sonic Team and Arzest have nailed it …",

Both the disc drive model and the digital model will be updated, but these two models aren't as different as they used to be: you will now be able to purchase a disc drive separately, allowing you to upgrade a digital model to a disc-compatible version. Both versions will be available this November, and will eventually replace the current model of PS5 altogether.\n\"The new PS5 has been reduced in volume by more than 30%, and weight by 18% and 24% compared to the previous models,\" the PlayStation blog post reads. It also mentions that the new covers have different textures, which isn't immediately clear from the pictures. \"There are four separate cover panels,\" it says, \"with the top portion in a glossy look, while the bottom remains in matte.\" This does raise questions about the compatibility of console shells Sony currently sells that allow you to change the look of your console, but this question is not addressed in the announcement.\nThe slim PS5 with a disc drive will still cost $499.99. The PS5 digital edition retails at $449.99, a $50 increase from the original digital edition. \nIf you do buy a newer digital version and decide to upgrade it to a disc version, the drive will cost you $79.99 in the US, €119.99 in Europe, £99.99 in the UK, and ¥11,980 in Japan. The total cost of a digital console and a disc drive is a little more expensive than buying a disc drive version outright. The console will include a new horizontal stand to set the console on its side, and a vertical stand will be on sale for $29.99 USD | 29.99 EURO | 24.99 GBP | 3,980 JPY.

          "description": "Ubisoft revealed its \"fast-paced firefights meets punk rock mosh pits\" first-person shooter, Tom Clancy's XDefiant, in 2021. It's a free-to-play shooter that features factions from different Ubisoft properties, like Splinter Cell, Watch Dogs, The Division, and Far Cry. We went hands-on with XDefiant earlier this year and came away impressed with the shooter. Players enjoyed an open beta back in June, and the full game was set to launch in the summer, but now, developer Ubisoft San Francisco has delayed its preseason launch indefinitely. \nThe team announced this on Twitter yesterday, revealing that the recent Public Test Session was a success but highlighted some inconsistencies in the game experience it wants to address before the preseason launch. As such, the preseason launch has been delayed to a later unspecified date. \nHere's Ubisoft's full statement on the XDefiant preseason launch delay: \nAn update on XDefiant- pic.twitter.com/3orSnspmp6\nOctober 9, 2023\nAs you can see, Ubisoft doesn't indicate when to expect the Preseason launch to happen, making this an indefinite delay. \nIn the meantime, watch Game Informer's XDefiant New Gameplay Today and then read our XDefiant impressions after going hands-on with the game earlier this year. \nHave you played XDefiant?

          "description": "Dark Side, the exciting sequel of the groundbreaking Driller, is ready for public testing!\nDark Side, like its predecessor, was released by Incentive Software Limited in 1988, shortly after Driller. The updated gameplay features a jetpack that allows you to leave the ground, providing a new and fresh perspective that emphasizes the excitement and challenges of exploring Tricuspid, the second alien moon of planet Evath.\nThis time, the vicious Ketars have scattered and hidden Energy Collection Devices (ECD) around their base to destroy your home planet. It’s up to you to destroy them first! The tricky part is many ECDs are connected to each other and can regenerate instantly, so you must figure out the right order to successfully complete your mission. \nOur reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Dark Side support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. Additionally, there are two playable demos if you want to test the game. Support for Amiga and AtariST will be available later! Please contact us if you have some other release.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.\n>",
