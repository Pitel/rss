After decades of neglect, however, Switch owners can now rejoice, as we’re not only getting one, but five games from Hideo Kojima’s Magnum Opus (plus a couple of fun non-canon extras thrown in for good measure). The question, however, is whether this compilation - dubbed Master Collection Vol. 1 - is actually worth owning.\nThe good news is that, yes, this is more or less a strong representation of Metal Gear’s history from 1987 to 2004, encompassing everything from the original MSX2 release of Metal Gear to the critically acclaimed prologue, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. For newcomers especially, the collection is a convenient way to experience a significant chunk of the Metal Gear saga, but there are admittedly several drawbacks that dull the shine on what could (and should) have been an easy slam dunk for Konami.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

So it's jarring to hear from Mackey McCandlish, one of Modern Warfare's original developers, that the old Infinity Ward team were split over the act of using XP to unlock guns, with some worrying it would be \"unfair\".\r\n\n \nRead more",

The 30 maps offer good honest fragging in everything from concrete cities to murderous mystical puzzle boxes. Honestly, I'd recommend downloading the pack even if only to see the hub level and marvel at quite how good Quake can look when made for modern PCs.\nRead more",

By being 30 years old, CCP is old by company standards.” As we talk, his fixation on persistence and artefact becomes clear. Though, he’s never hidden it. In 2014, Pétursson’s company, CCP, unveiled a five-metre-tall sculpture with the names of every active player in their MMO, EVE Online, etched into its surface; this year, they expanded the monument to add the names of players who have subscribed in the decade since. “I've been obsessed about doing things like printed books, magazines, models of EVE Online...,” Pétursson tells me, “like there's this need to leave a footprint.” \r\n\n\r\n\r\nPétursson has discovered a company that uses cow stem cells to 3D print calfskin. For the studio’s 30th anniversary, he plans to commission a poetry chapter inspired by Iceland’s epic history book, the Prose Edda, write it on the artificial skin, and put it in a Reykjavik museum. It would sit alongside an ancient calfskin copy of the Icelandic sagas. “It was written 1000 years ago, but as an Icelandic person, I can still read and understand what it says,” Pétursson explains. He tells me that it’s an effective way of storing data because if you sent a USB stick 1,000 years into the future, where would you even find a computer with a drive to read it? This appreciation for artefacts and need for legacy has led to his current project, a new game from CCP using blockchain technology, currently known as Project Awakening.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The premise is perfectly brain-bending: each world contains or is contained by another world, and you're a beetle who can not only leap between them, but pick one world up and use it as a puzzle prop inside another.\nThe game doesn't really verbalise any of this: there's no equivalent for Atreus in God Of War: Ragnarok, ostentatiously nudging you towards each solution. And yet somehow, I find myself flowing through Cocoon like I'm being poured out of a bottle, switching scales and putting together the pieces in a way that feels effortful yet graceful, earned yet... eerily frictionless. This is no reflection on my knack for solving puzzles. It's a show of how elegantly the game is made so that while there's difficulty, there's rarely frustration.\nRead more",

It's been available on Switch for a couple of years now in Japan, but this week it received an English eShop version, and it's taken off a bit with streamers and Twitch folk. It's also spawned dozens of clones, including an unofficial free web browser version that I've been giving a go over the last couple of lunch times to see what all the fuss is about. It's a neat little time waster. It's a teensy bit different to the proper Switch version, but the basic concept is the same: it's a essentially physics-based fruit Tetris meets Threes, where you're dropping similar-looking fruits on top of one another to combine them into even larger fruits. \nThe goal is to combine them enough times to get the big watermelon for mega points, but honestly, I'm not sure how much longer I can keep playing this free version of Suika, because so many of the fruits you meet along the way to the watermelon just look so gosh darn sad that it's breaking my heart a little.

This is just a quick Codec to let you know that Konami's stealth blockbuster bundle Metal Gear Solid - Master Collection Volume 1 is now available to buy. Did you ever play Metal Gear Solid, Snake? It's this sprawling philosophical epic about war, surveillance, AI, nationalism and anti-heroism, a baroque metafictional saga spanning generations that is also a complex series of videogame design experiments. I know - it's a lot to take in, Snake, but you can sort of boil the series down to the difference between two varieties of wall. There are the ones you hide behind, so as to get the drop on your foes, and there are the ones you break, because they're fourth walls, Snake. Do you see?\r\n\n \nRead more",

In particular, Nesmith reckons it will \"absolutely\" continue with Skyrim's approach to levelling and progression, whereby you improved skills by performing the associated actions. He also thinks the game will \"probably\" retain elements of the magic system he designed for Skyrim, which broke away from Oblivion and Morrowind in being simpler to understand and more immediately powerful, at the price of flexibility and inventiveness.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Who was this strutting Seattle intellectual, with his glass of sherry and his call-in psychiatry show and his passion for silverware?\nI couldn’t abide Frasier and developed a pathological aversion to headliner (and surprisingly convincing X-Man) Kelsey Grammer – but that was before The Simpsons spoofed Frasier and showed me the error of my ways. I still wouldn’t say I’m an outright Frasier fan - or Frasien, as they prefer to be known. Some of the humour is kind of eeesh, in hindsight. But I’ve experienced and enjoyed enough to find Edward La Barbera’s Fraiser Fantasy pretty funny.\r\n\r\n \nRead more",

Some of its 'Chonker'-sized pool balls even have coiffed miniature moustaches for crying out loud, and they all babble cute nonsense noises at you as you ping them around its procedurally generated boards; hrnnnnngh they're just so gosh darn endearing that I simply cannot help myself.

This is survival horror just the way Mother used to make it - before Mother read all those forbidden books and decided to sacrifice you to Samael, Lord of Serpents and Reeds. You've got your 3D engine with fixed camera perspectives, your thick coating of TV static, your sluggish vehicular control scheme, your enemies that could be either demons or metaphors and will murder you either way. \r\n\n\r\nThere's a big dollop of Resident Evil here, too, and a gentler dusting of Fatal Frame. The main character is driven by grief, sports a fiesty tank-and-shorts combo, and is equipped with a flash camcorder for exorcising spooks rather than a firearm. In other words, she's the point on the Venn diagram between Jill Valentine, Miku Hinasaki and Harry Mason. The individual camera choices are more Evil than Hilly: the game frequently switches to a close-up face-on perspective when you enter a room, forcing you to step into the blindspot. That endless inter-dimensional staircase, though? Pure Team Silent. Other influences include Half-Life, Puppet Combo and Donnie Darko.\r\n\n\r\nI'm pretty sold on Heartworm, though I'm still waiting for it to spark its own identity from all those grated-together shards of older horror games. So it's a bit sad that the project is in enormous trouble.\r\n \nRead more",

But I appreciate that while I might not get on with them, many others will enjoy the bite of an olive on its own, or the increased airflow to their larynx as they chortle at Joey doing the silly thing he does at Rachel, or whatever. Ghostrunner 2, a first-person cyberpunk slasher and sequel to Ghostrunner, has joined the echelon of things that aren't for me but might be for you.\nThat's because the game's relentlessly unforgiving, and sets margins so small you're rarely afforded much freedom. Sometimes it really does put you in the RGB kicks of a cyber ninja as you dash between the halves of cyborgs you've cleaved in two, but these moments can often be the weary culmination of agonising trial and error. If you're into that, great! If you're not, then I'd slink back into that shadow.\nRead more",

          "description": "It's been 11 long years since the unveiling of Squadron 42, Star Citizen's singleplayer campaign, seven years since developer Cloud Imperium Games broke Squadron 42 off into a standalone purchase, five years since Crytek took them to court for allegedly breaching their CryEngine license, three years since Crytek and Cloud Imperium settled that lawsuit, and three years since director Chris Roberts sought to justify the game's mammoth development time to Kickstarter backers, declaring that \"it would be doing a huge disservice to everyone working really hard on the project and all of you that are looking forward to it to deliver something that isn't great.\" Well, all that waiting has finally paid off, as Squadron 42 is now officially... \"feature-complete\" and \"into the polishing phase\", meaning that the Wing Commander-inspired space sim is almost guaranteed to release before the death of our sun.\r\n\n\r\nCloud Imperium have released a new trailer walkthrough to celebrate, which does admittedly look spaceworthy. It's a whistle-stop tour of Squadron 42 gameplay and story materials - from dogfights in asteroid belts that use a new precision targeting feature, through \"OMG my CO is Gillian Anderson\" cinematics, to physics-based puzzling malarkey involving a Half-Life Gravity Gun-adjacent gizmo. If I were, say, Starfield developer Bethesda, I'd be particularly worried about those planetary surface flyovers. Mind you, by the time Squadron 42 launches we'll probably be playing Starfield 2. I kid, Roberts, I kid!\r\n\n \nRead more",

It was too frantic, too awkward, too short. Deadnaut Colon Signal Lost changes all those things and more. It's more like a re-interpretation of its own ideas than a direct sequel. Consequently, it's sanded off a little of its unique nature, but overall is a much better game.\nEven though it's a bloody roguelike. Godddd.\nRead more",

          "description": "At the beginning of September, the soundtrack for Tunic disappeared from streaming services. The composers, Lifeformed and Janice Kwan, said they'd received several false DMCA takedown notices for their work, which had resulted in the removal of both Tunic's soundtrack from numerous platforms, as well as three more of their albums. For a while, things looked very uncertain about the likelihood of their soundtracks returning. Left without much recourse against their distributor, the composers eventually filed a counterclaim to try and better protect their work and get them back online. Thankfully, they were successful, and all four soundtracks are back where they belong.  \nIt's been a messy saga about that's highlighted several issues about how DMCA claims can be manipulated like this, and they're not the only ones it's happened to recently, either. Fortunately for the Tunic duo at least, the situation's since been resolved and their soundtracks are now back where they belong - and to celebrate, they've released a whole new set of Tunic tracks that they describe as \"initial piano concepts\" for some of its major themes. And hey. You know me. I love a good piano collection of a video game soundtrack, so it is probably no surprise whatsoever that I've more or less had this on repeat for the last month. It's so, so, so good. \nRead more",

I know Bit.Trip Runner and Choice Provisions’ assorted Bit.Trip rhythm games have been available on Steam for absolutely yonks (and still are, in fact), but my memories of these are all on the Nintendo Wii. That’s where I encountered most of the games first - and I haven’t really been back since. I dabbled in Runner 2 on the Wii U, but positively bounced off the 3D-ness of Runner 3 when it came to PC, preferring instead the clean, simple lines of its stark pixel sprites. \nIt's with some surprise, then, that I’ve had such a good time with Bit.Trip ReRunner, the recently released fancied up version of the auto-running original that brings its rhythmic courses kicking and screaming into that third dimension. But it’s really more of a compilation game than anything else, packing in extra protein in the form of EP soundtracks and freshly-created course selections from all eight games in the series (mashing tunes from Beat, Core, Void, Fate, Flux into a Runner-style format), as well as lots of new tricks and abilities up its sleeve. But the crown jewel in ReRunner isn’t so much the joy of getting a fresh dose of OG Runner again, but seeing what its player base has already started making with its brilliant Runner Maker level editor. Yep, much like Super Mario Maker before it, Bit.Trip has opened itself up to the whims of would-be game making audience, and they are running with it (sorry).\nRead more",

Sid Meier’s Alpha Centauri By Sid Meier endures partly because its design has aged well, but mostly because it's an unusually human 4X strategy. Its high concept story asks for interpretation, for a philosophical response. Where so many others are about the arbitrary icons of nationalism, or stock elves/insectoids/robots, it's a game about ideology and personality. Where a sequel to Civilization's \"send a colony ship into space\" ending could have asked \"what if lasers and aliens\", Alpha Centauri instead asked: Where is humanity going?\nRead more",

In Urbo there are no sky lasers, no oncoming hordes. Nothing. Just dinky little grid-based maps, and an endless stream of tiny adorable buildings to plonk down on them in the pursuit of sweet, sweet point scores.\nThis being a puzzle game, the aim here is to place three buildings of the same type altogether, either in a line or right-angled cluster, at which point they'll all shzooge together to level up to the next building type. This is where the Threes comparison comes in, though you can zhuzh more than three of the same building together if you're smart to earn more points. But it's not quite as simple as that. You see, your buildings will only shoump onto the tile you placed down last, and careful city planners will likely want to think about placing their buildings in reverse so they end up with their fancy new house in the place they actually want it, not in an awkward middle spot that cuts off two precious tiles from play, or awkwardly sits in the middle of another chain of dwellings accidentally. And yep, that's where the Dorfromantik connection comes in, and I really do like it very, very much.\nRead more",

Did you fail to combo those magical abilities and terrain variables as the developers hoped - nay, dreamed you would, forcing you to rely on ye olde cover-shoot tactics to reach the checkpoint?

The horror manga artist has an immediately recognisable style that intersects detailed, line heavy art with strange and upsetting concepts, and some of his short stories have acquired a sort of semi-memetic status (\"This is my hole! It was made for me!\"). If you're at all familiar with Junji Ito's work you will look at unforgiving almost-text-adventure World Of Horror and go \"Huh, that's inspired by Junji Ito.\"\nThis isn't just because it looks like his work but rendered in MSPaint, or because it contains, just, direct references to it, but because of the whole vibe. You encounter face-sloughing-off kinds of monsters and vengeful spirits inspired by Japanese folkloric yokai, but also weirdo janitors doing stuff like turning the swim team into mermaids in a kind of pervier version of Tusk. At the same time, there's a streak of the Lovecraftian in play to keep it nice and legally distinct, as each self-contained run at the titular world is an attempt to save your town from destruction at the hands of an Old God (they earn the leaden thud of the capital letters). You will fail a lot. But isn't failure part of the fun!? Imagine that enthusiastic question as a big spoonful of marmite popped into your mouth.\nRead more",

Created by Odd Meter, the studio behind the well-received fantasy VR bow simulator Sacralith: The Archer's Tale, and published by Frostpunk developer 11 bit Studios, it's a \"very serious adventure game\" set in 19th century Russia, which casts you as a young Orthodox Christian nun on the run. Awash with doubts about her faith, and persecuted by a mysterious creature, the woman flees her nunnery and falls in with an escaped convict, who tells her of a mysterious \"holy elder\" who might ease her troubles, drawing on the power of a sacred artefact.\nThe game's setting is naturalistic, with motion-captured facial animations and photorealistic buildings and interiors, wrought using Unreal Engine. But it is also a \"fairy tale\" landscape, in the words of studio co-founder Dmitry Setlov, shot through with phantasmagorical flourishes - monochrome or blood-red filters and apparent hallucinations, to say nothing of the aforesaid creature, a skulking mass of tendrils that puts me in mind of the Shadow from Ursula K Le Guin's novel A Wizard Of Earthsea.\nRead more",

On 19th August 1839, a young man opens his eyes to find himself in a vast, silent castle in the forests of Prussia. He discovers a letter from his \"past self\", Daniel, who urges him to murder the castle's secluded owner, a baron named Alexander, and warns that he is being hunted by a monstrous Shadow. 60 years later on New Year's Eve, the celebrated meat factory owner Oswald Mandus starts awake in the opulent stillness of his manor house in London. Hearing the distant voices of his children, he goes to look for them in the \"splendid architectures\" below.\nOn 21st July 1916, at the height of World War I, the soldier Henri Clément stumbles from his sickbed in a colossal bunker beneath the Western Front. With nobody about, and no memory of events during his convalescence, he follows a trail of blood through the collapsing tunnels towards the pantry. And on an unknown day in March 1939, the engineering drafter Tasi Trianon wakes in the wreckage of a plane, deep in the Algerian desert, and enters the nearby caves in search of her husband Salim. Four games, four forgotten pasts, four new beginnings, one descent.\nBeware: major spoilers for the entire Amnesia series below.\nRead more",

It's the next game from the Trese Brothers, the makers of Star Traders: Frontiers, and I've been playing its opening missions over the last couple of days. It's good, folks, and there's a lot to dig into with its release into early access this week. \nThere's a sizable story campaign and a bunch of side missions already playable here, and its emphasis on stealth and escalating security levels whisked me right back to the good old days of 2015 when I first sat down to play Klei's stealthy masterpiece. There are still a couple of rough edges here and there, but if you've been looking for a strategy RPG with a harder-edge than, say, Mimimi's recently released Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, or just something a bit sneakier than your run of XCOM-likes, Cyber Knights: Flashpoint is definitely worth keeping an augmented eye on.\nRead more",

          "description": "Back in the glorious Xbox One years, when every Microsoft executive was engaged in the act of putting one foot in their mouth while shooting it simultaneously, there was a giddy period of marketing conducted by means of Phil Spencer's T-shirts. He'd rock up on E3 stages like a cabaret dancer, touting tees with various new or elderly videogame licenses on them, and whipping older fans into a frenzy of speculation as to possible remakes or sequels. I myself had to go lie down after seeing Phil in a Phantom Dust shirt. Teaser-shirts, we should have called them. Look at him in the picture up there, showing off a chestful of Hexen. Shameless!\r\n\n\r\nSadly/happily, those halcyon days are behind us, but Phil still loves to dangle the carrot of an ancient IP now and then. Speaking on the Xbox podcast last night (while sporting a boring Halo championship jacket), he suggested that Microsoft could do more to revive their older franchises. Or at least \"revisit\" them in some fashion. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "With the release of Intel's somewhat underwhelming 14th-gen processors today, I feel a lot of people are going to be looking once more at AMD Ryzen 7000 systems. These CPUs offer the same access to DDR5 RAM and PCIe 5.0 components as Intel's latest offerings, yet typically consume less power while delivering better gaming performance at the high end. That makes it easier to build a balanced system, especially with deals on Ryzen 7000 CPUs and motherboards starting to become more commonplace. \nCase in point is this AWD-IT bundle deal on a Ryzen 5 7600X and an MSI MAG B650 Tomahawk WiFi motherboard for £400, versus £445 for the two items separately.

But the biggest surprise? How familiar it felt. So, it might be a bit odd that MW3 is wholly unsurprising for being more COD and simultaneously, a surprise for being more COD. Really, I think it comes down to developer Sledgehammer's decision to mash some of COD's previous triumphs with some of its finest maps.\nDespite COD extending its hand with a warm welcome back, I can't help but feel it's one trembled with nerves. MW3's beta suckered me in with its nostalgia hits but there's definitely an air of it being a stopgap as devs figure out where it should turn next.\nRead more",

That's according to the union Bandcamp United, who are even now restarting discussions with Epic in the hope of obtaining a better outcome.\nIt's terrible news for those affected, of course, but it also doesn't bode well for the future of independent music. Bandcamp, which has now traded hands twice in two years, is one of the few places where indie musicians can make a living. There are plenty of angry reactions from musicians and bands on social media, as you'd expect, but game developers are also rallying in support of Bandcamp United, with criticism aimed at Epic and Songtradr in equal measure.\r\n\n \nRead more",

This is a thing Goldman I have in common. To help you tell us apart, a point of difference between Goldman and I is that he expressed his love of stupid courage by writing Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid, whereas I express mine by really liking Cyberpunk 2077.\r\n\nStupid courage is a trait that CD Projekt Red's first-person RPG seems to admire, but that's never more clear than in a new ending to the base game added by the Phantom Liberty expansion. It shows what happens when the heroes reject stupid courage and choose self-centred pragmatism instead. Spoilers for Cyberpunk 2077 and Phantom Liberty throughout.\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Za poslední měsíc se událo spoustu nového. Se strahovskými bastlíři jste se mohli potkat na LinuxDays, kde jste si mohli zapájet demoboard s novým procesorem CH32V003 (RISC-V za deset centů, pro který mimochodem Vojta Suk napsal programátor běžící na Flipper Zero). Vyšlo Raspberry Pi 5 se spoustou inovací (i nových bugů), nový iPhone s Thread rádiem a USB-C místo Lightningu (který začali bastlíři hned hackovat) a v KiCADu už jde dělat databázové knihovny přes Inventree.\r\n\r\nZe světa hardwaru si můžete něco poslechnout o nových osciloskopech od Rigolu (a jak probíhá jejich hackování), nové knize o Micro:bit deskách, koprocesoru RP1 na Rapsberry Pi 5, novém Turrisu nebo jak si postavit reléovou ústřednu s ethernetem a SCPI. Možná dojde i na ukázku redukce mezi USB a komunistickou kopií GPIB známou jako IMS-2.\r\n\r\nPokud jde o měkčí stránku bastlířství, tedy software, představí bastlíři nový Node-RED. Nedávno se objevil také levný čínský radar schopný rozeznat více objektů najednou a proběhlo další kolo TinyTapeout, ve kterém je možné nechat si vyrobit vlastní ASIC.\r\n\r\nŽe byl tento měsíc velmi plodný a náročný, lze poznat i z toho, že tentokráte mají strahováci neobvykle málo bizarních témat, mezi nimiž tentokrát kralují ESD kroksy a masivně paralelní instalace Rapsberry Pi v průmyslovém prostředí, která samozřejmě skončila neslavně.\r\n\r\nPříští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve středu 25. října od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

          "description": "In the year 2024, a new Castlevania-like title is coming our way - for the Game Boy Color.\n\n\nComing to us courtesy of Incube8 Games and the development team at Spacebot Interactive, Dracula: Dark Reign is unique in that it's the first video game ever to be equipped with the Stoker license. Bram Stoker published his iconic novel Dracula in 1897. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBram's great-grandnephew Dacre Stoker created the StokerVerse label alongside his partner Chris McAuley. The duo aims to publish games, comics, and novels under the StokerVerse banner. Each of these is inspired by the works of Bram Stoker. \n\n\nBecause Dark Reign sports the StokerVerse license, it's able to take a deep dive into the world of the 1897 novel. Players will take on the role of the story's protagonist, Jonathan Harker, as he attempts to escape the vampire's castle. The upcoming Game Boy Color Metroidvania title even features a never-before-seen prologue to the original book that's pulled from Bram Stoker's personal notes. \n\n\nIncube8 Games promises a \"unique blend of storytelling, exploration, and action\" within Dracula: Dark Reign. All of which is based on Stoker's source material from many, many years ago. \n\n\nDracula: Dark Reign makes its physical Game Boy Color cartridge debut in 2024 for $59.99. A future Digital Edition is also planned that will be playable via PC or Mac emulators. A demo is available for players to try out on the Dracula: Dark Reign demo page. \n\nThe post A Castlevania-style Bram Stoker’s Dracula game is coming to Game Boy Color appeared first on Destructoid.",

At least, that's how I view many of these games, since occasional visits to previous generations can sometimes be painful.\n\n\nThat said, some of the best games from the last several years have retro games to thank, be they platformers, survival horror, or RPGs.

Players will be able to don the mantle of Medieval Lord as they oversee their own medieval manor on April 26. Manor Lords will also launch as a Day One title on Game Pass for PC.\n\n\n\n\nYes, mi'lord?\n\n\nManor Lords features a unique playstyle, allowing players to manage the city-building of their manor while also fighting off threats such as bandits and rival lords. As a lord, players will exploit the local resources to build up their castle and surrounding kingdom. As you expand your settlement you will establish trade routes and master your surroundings as you seek to meet the demands of your people.\n\n\nIn terms of combat, Manor Leads features a real-time tactical combat system where you rally your working population in your manor as militia to join you on the battlefield. As your military is also your workforce, each death on the battlefield can result in a labor shortage once the war is over.\n\n\nIt was also revealed that Manor Lords will eventually make its way to consoles as well, at which time it will also be a Day One on Xbox title.\n\n\nI've had my eye on Manor Lords since it was revealed. There was a demo during a Steam Next Fest months ago and I know a lot of people enjoyed it. Even though I didn't get a chance to play it, the bits I saw looked like quite an experience. It looks like things have been even further optimized as well. It's always cool when you get to build things and then also go down in first person and explore.\n\n\nManor Lords releases on April 26 on PC and as a Day One on Game Pass title.\n\nThe post Manor Lords releases in April and is Day One on Game Pass appeared first on Destructoid.",

This one offers up a better idea of all the poses you'll need to contort your body into through each game. There's shaking, dancing, punching, wiggling, and plenty of nose-picking throughout. The new footage from Nintendo's latest trailer shows off both singleplayer and local multiplayer modes. \n\n\n\n\nIn addition to highlighting forms, the trailer previews Museum Mode, which lets you choose from microgames and practice at different speeds. Party mode lets two to four players compete against one another in five different games. There are the bizarro rules of Galactic Conquest and the order-following Listen to the Doctor. Medusa March has you crawling a dungeon while avoiding the stone-cold stare of Medusa herself. Go the Distance puts you through a microgame gauntlet with your dukes up. Finally, you can test your guessing game skills in The Who's in Control show, which requires four players. \n\n\nScreenshot via Nintendo YouTube\n\n\nWah, Wah, Yeah!\n\n\nLike previous WarioWare games, there's a Story Mode that lets you play through stages featuring different characters. All the stages put the spotlight on their own forms to keep you on your toes. It looks as ridiculous as ever, even if some of it will no doubt depend on how many friends you can wrangle together for local multiplayer.

Alongside the announcement is an 8-minute in-depth look at the game.\n\n\nSpirittea is a management quest game (think Stardew Valley) inspired by Studio Ghibli’s Spirited Away. You play as a writer, trying to get some peace to pen your next novel. Drinking from the wrong teapot causes the spirit realm to fold over into reality. You’re given the keys to a bathhouse, where you then scrub down spirits and help them relax.\n\n\n\n\nCheesemaker describes Spirittea as a “life sim, management game, and detective game all in one.” Essentially, that means you help the townsfolk exorcise the ghosts that are bothering them, which you then try to accommodate within your bathhouse. The bathhouse can be upgraded, which is necessary to attract some of the spirits. Beyond that is a life simulator with four seasons that affect what quests you can accomplish.\n\n\nThis might be exactly what I need right now. Management games tend to be my go-to for relaxation. I can definitely dig the Mother 3-style art, though it’s a bit jarring when a character portrait comes up, and they’re much more realistically drawn. Nonetheless, the Spirited Away influence is obvious, and that’s something I can totally dig. I think I’ll probably play this one.\n\n\nSpirittea is coming to Switch, Xbox, and PC on November 13, 2023. There’s a demo available for it right now.\n\nThe post Ghost scrubbing simulator Spirittea arrives on November 13 appeared first on Destructoid.",

To add to that, not only has Bethesda's newest release been played by more than 11 million people so far, it's also been a major achievement for Game Pass.\n\n\nThat's according to a recent Microsoft earnings call, which took place on October 24. Among a bunch of other wins for the tech giant, Starfield has done wonders for the Xbox subscription service. According to the transcript (or you could listen to the whole audio if you prefer), the deep space adventure set a new record for the \"most Game Pass subscriptions added on a single day ever.\"\n\n\n\n\nAmong the 11 million people that have taken to the stars, almost half of them played the game on PC. The transcript goes on to say that Starfield's launch has \"benefited Xbox content and services.\"\n\n\nThe rich get richer\n\n\nIn gaming overall, Microsoft has said that revenue has \"increased 9% and 8% in constant currency\" with a \"better-than-expected subscriber growth in Xbox Game Pass.\" No prizes for guessing which game is pretty much responsible for this uptick (no, not Redfall. Why would you say that?).\n\n\nThe hype behind Starfield was pretty immense for what felt like a long time. Given that it's Bethesda's first game since Microsoft bought the company in 2021, Xbox put its muscle behind the space-faring RPG.\n\n\nMany of us might be losing a bit of interest in the game now, but the revenue and player count show just how popular Skyrim-in-space has been. But will it last as long as The Elder Scrolls 5? Only time will tell (I say no).\n\nThe post More than 11 million people have played Starfield, Microsoft says appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s that time of year when many yearlong memberships lapse, so Nintendo has strategically announced that Mario Party 3 will become playable for Nintendo Switch owners around the world this week.\n\n\nMario Party 3 is the culmination of the original Mario Party trilogy on Nintendo’s 64-bit console. In many ways, it offered more of what the previous two entries did. There were more boards to play on, more minigames to ruin your thumbstick with, and more random elements to ruin your friendships. That said, I can’t lie; I really liked this one back in the day. Even today, I still hear many consider this one the best in the series.\n\n\nWith that in mind, I can sort of see why Nintendo might tempt Switch owners into ano…",

          "description": "It's no secret that Bethesda games are notorious for being pretty broken. Starfield is no exception and while we wait around for Todd Howard and his crew to unleash an update for its latest IP, the fan base has things covered for now.\n\n\nAs spotted by DSO Gaming, Starfield's Community Patch is now ready to download if you have the game on PC. The mod is the result of a series of people working together to make improvements to Bethesda's space-faring RPG. You can download the patch here.\n\n\nImage via Bethesda/Steam.\n\n\nBundled with this fan-made mod is a series of fixes for the game, including addressing script errors, game-breaking exploits, faulty quests, inconsistencies, and more. It even fixes a few spelling errors as well.\n\n\nWhat the Community Patch is not\n\n\nWhile this mod aims to fix some glaring and not-so-glaring problems with Starfield, it's good to clear the air about what you shouldn't expect from the download. \n\n\nFor starters – as the description itself says – the Community Patch does not offer any new content or changes to the overall balance of the game outside \"correcting obvious errors.\" It's specifically designed to address glitches and some other issues, hopefully making for a better experience.\n\n\nThe patch also uses an MIT license, which means it's open-source. As a result, this mod is \"intended to be owned by the community, rather than an individual or team.\" Therefore, anybody who wishes to contribute to the patch can do so.\n\n\nObviously, Bethesda will be sending out its own hotfixes and updates in the future. What these will address cannot be said at this stage, so it's nice to have a fan solution in the interim.\n\nThe post Starfield’s Community Patch is here, bringing bug fixes and tweaks appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "At this point, it's safe to say that people are ready for The Elder Scrolls 6. While we're likely still years away from playing it, it feels as though Bethesda will start putting more stock into the Skyrim follow-up now that Starfield is out.\n\n\nWith that in-mind, a recent interview with MinnMax suggests that some elements from previous TES games will make their way into the sixth installment. Former Bethesda employee Bruce Nesmith – who was lead designer for Skyrim – has said that elements that go as far back as Oblivion could be \"further developed\" for The Elder Scrolls 6.\n\n\nThat particular part of the interview begins around the one-hour 13-minute mark.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Nesmith is not certain what these aspects will be. He does add that we will find his \"fingerprints\" in the next installment based on how the games have been designed in the past and his impact on the series.\n\n\nIt's a kind of magic\n\n\nNesmith then goes on to say that TES6 will likely have traces of the magical elements from Skyrim. So if you like the magic system in TES5, that's something to perhaps look forward to (maybe).\n\n\nBruce had been involved with the Elder Scrolls franchise since 1996's Daggerfall, eventually becoming Senior Game Designer for Bethesda. He was also a quest designer for Fallout 3. If you've played a Bethesda RPG since the mid-90s, you'll have experienced Nesmith's input. These days, he's a fantasy novelist. His first novel, Mischief Maker: Norse Mythology Reimagined, was released in 2021.\n\n\nAs for The Elder Scrolls 6, we're still pretty much in the dark. Nesmith's comments seem largely speculative, so it's best not to take what he says as the final word in what the elusive Skyrim follow-up will be like.\n\nThe post Former Skyrim designer says his “fingerprints” will be on The Elder Scrolls 6 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Dynamight Studios announced today that its open-world sandbox MMORPG Fractured Online will be returning to Steam Early Access. The official release date for the return is November 8 at 10 a.m. ET. It's been a rough road so far for the MMO. Originally Gamigo became the publisher for the game, but after a short period of time Dynamight pulled the MMO from steam and later parted ways with Gamigo. They are now self-publishing the MMO as it heads back into early access.\n\n\n\n\nIt seems to be the common thing now for MMORPG developers to part ways with their publisher and take on the role. A couple of years ago Pearl Abyss split ways with Kakao Games over publishing popular MMORPG Black Desert Online. Not-yet-released MMO Ashes of Creation also split ways with its publisher, My.Games, and will self-publish the MMO whenever it releases.\n\n\nRegardless of the reason, it's good news for the players Gamigo has a history of killing MMOs, which they've done with Fiesta Online and most of Trion Worlds' lineup of MMOs including Archeage, Rift, and Trove.\n\n\nAs for Fractured Online, it looks like an entertaining twist on the sandbox MMO formula. Players will work together, and against one another, as they claim zones, gather resources, craft, trade, and build their own empire. The MMO features a player-driven economy as players can be farmers, hunters, scavengers, miners, crafters, and even merchants.\n\n\nApparently there were some wipes previously, but moving forward there will be no wipes unless it is \"strictly necessary\".\n\n\nFractured Online hits Early Access on Steam on November 8.\n\nThe post Fractured Online returns to Steam Early Access next month appeared first on Destructoid.",

Players can participate in obstacle courses inspired by the free-to-play title within the Golden Saucer casino/theme park.\n\n\nInitially announced in July, the crossover teased FFXIV characters crossing a bright obstacle course. Fall Guys, meanwhile was receiving skins from the critically acclaimed MMORPG. Outside the stills shown within the teaser, the details are light on the FFXIV side. That is still the case since the blog post announcing the patch tells fans to stay tuned for more details.\n\n\nAs of now, the crossover's webpage is also giving the same instructions, so hopefully, more details arrive soon. Based on the images shown, players will race others while avoiding various dangers and collaborate with others to collect gems. The Fall Guys influence is evident here, but the events have details from Final Fantasy titles.\n\n\nThe event tonally fits with what the Golden Saucer goes for, which is grand and extravagant fun for any attendees. In my experience playing Final Fantasy XIV, chucking players into an arena with dozens of others is something the casino would do. Plus Fall Guys is the perfect game to collaborate with on this event given that it's that title's premise.\n\n\nIt's unknown how long this event will go on, especially since the FFXIV skins in Fall Guys are no longer available. Hopefully, the courses live up to their potential enough for fans to sink more hours earning prizes in the casino.\n\nThe post Fall Guys meets FFXIV next week in Gold Saucer Patch 6.5 update appeared first on Destructoid.",

The mobile version for iOS and Android will be free-to-play with in-app purchases, offering over 50 Officers from five factions to \"collect and develop.\" Each Officer has their own tactics to employ across 520 stages and 13 regions.\n\n\nAccording to Gematsu, a soft launch is live in Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Philippines. While we wait for the worldwide launch, Nexon Korea shared some cinematic trailers. This one highlights the Battle of Hulao Gate:\n\n\n\n\nThe last we heard of Dynasty Warriors 9 was the Empires expansion that launched in 2021. M isn't the first game to strike phones and tablets exclusively. Dynasty Warriors: Overlords recently mixed Musou combat with town building, quests, and very mobile-style events. As teased in some of the videos, M will cover territory familiar to anyone modestly well-versed in the Three Kingdoms era. Settings like the Yellow Turban Rebellion and the Siege of Luoyang are deeply tread hack-and-slashing ground.\n\n\nWill Dynasty Warriors M revitalize the greatest video game series ever? The official English Facebook page is live for anyone who wants to keep up with the game in the months leading up to its global release. \n\nThe post Dynasty Warriors M launches on mobile around the world this Winter appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "With Alan Wake 2's launch rapidly approaching, fans are more than ready to jump back into Bright Falls. Before you get too excited, you should check your PC specs to ensure your graphics card supports mesh shading. \n\n\nOn Twitter, a Remedy developer stated that the Nvidia GeForce 10 series and AMD Ryzen 5000 graphics cards aren't mentioned in the PC spec requirements because \"only cards with mesh shaders are officially supported\" and they're \"not sure it will run without it.\" Hence, just because an RX 5700 XT can perform in the same ballpark as some of the supported cards, this doesn't guarantee you'll be able to play the game. \n\n\nThe tweets have since been deleted, though screenshots are still available on Reddit. Remedy was going to implement vertex shaders, which the cards support, but they dropped after it caused performance issues and bugs. The developer states that vertex shaders could, in theory, be added later via a mod, but it's not something you should hold your breath for. \n\n\n\n\nThis news comes as fans are still reeling from the high PC spec requirements for the game. A new Nvidia trailer showcasing ray tracing in Alan Wake 2 makes it apparent why Remedy has made the choices it had. With ray tracing on, Bright Falls becomes a visual treat filled with reflective puddles, accurate shadows, and shiny surfaces that reflect light.  \n\n\nIt has been a 13-year-long wait but Alan Wake 2 will finally launch on October 27. \n\nThe post Graphics cards that don’t support mesh shading may not be able to play Alan Wake 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

That's Valentine's Day for you romantics out there.\n\n\nThe release date was actually announced last week as part of The Indie Horror Showcase, and I have absolutely no idea how I missed it. Sucker for Love: First Date, if you recall, held a prestigious position as one of \"Zoey Handley’s Top 10 Picks of 2022.\" It's a dating sim in which you perform arcane rituals to win the heart(s?) of an existential threat to humanity. I love it for its unique take on the genre, as well as its spot-on sense of humor.\n\n\n\n\nSucker for Love: Date to Die For has had a demo for yonks, but I've yet to try it. Rather than cast you as a lust-driven cultist trapped in their apartment, this one has you kidnapped and in need of escape. Damn, these ladies really know what I'm into. I wonder if Hastur will be in this one. The way she says \"Yhtil\" puts the wobble in my knees.\n\n\nSucker for Love: Date to Die For incorporates the 360-degree camera of Phasmophobia and includes more exploration. At the forefront of all the press is the dateable Rhok'zan, The Black Goat of the Woods. I'm down. I love a girl with horns.\n\n\nI now have plans for Valentine's Day because Sucker for Love: Date to Die For is coming out on February 14, 2024 for PC.\n\nThe post Sucker for Love: Date to Die For brings eldritch seduction on February 14 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Sure, some smart, rich people say that we have to watch out for AI killing us all, but I’m pretty sure they’re just trying to make their new tech seem more impressive. All we’ve seen it do is put together some bad prose, resurrect dead celebrities, and give us pictures that invariably look uncomfortably off.

The Spider-Man games, in general, have often strived to provide the best facsimile of the protagonist’s preferred mode of transportation, web swinging, so adding something like gliding to the mix is a bit of an affront to me. It’s a personal preference, but thankfully, I can mostly ignore the skill and just get around the old-fashioned way. I often forget it even exists.\n\n\nHowever, while I was looking through Spider-Man 2’s various options to see if there is a way to turn off the visual wind-tunnel effects (there doesn’t seem to be), I did find something that might only appeal to strict swingers like myself.

The post-credits sequence of Iron Man served as a teaser for what was to come, as Samuel L.

With just two days until launch, Remedy released the Alan Wake 2 launch trailer during today's Xbox Partner Preview, which is where we also saw our first gameplay from Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Ikaro: Will Not Die, the new game from the makers of Powerwash Simulator. \nIn the trailer, we see dual protagonists Saga Anderson and the titular Alan Wake come to grips with the latter's ability to influence the real world with words written on his typewriter. Like the game, this trailer mixes Alan Wake 2's live-action elements with gameplay, and both look great. The gameplay continues to deliver the spooky action thrills previously seen in other trailers, and we get a new glimpse of the game's story. \nCheck out the Alan Wake 2 launch trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAlan Wake 2 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 27. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's hands-on with a Saga Anderson section of Alan Wake 2 and then read what we thought about playing as Alan Wake.

Arenas, which are based on recognizable real-world locations, are fully destructible and can be altered by players.\nThe open beta adds the new Skyway Stadium to the map rotation. The beta also introduces a new game mode called Bank-It, in which four teams of three fight to gather coins, with the winner either hitting a max limit first or having the most cash banked at the end of the round. \n\n\nPlayers will have access to 20 weapons, 26 gadgets, and 9 abilities used to reduce targets into showers of gold coins. Item progression will feature 5 Mastery Levels per weapon as well. \nThe open beta is cross-platform, so players on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam can jump in. It will run until November 5. The beta includes a free battle pass with 16 exclusive, permanent rewards that carry over to the game’s eventual full launch.",

In the trailer, we get a first look at the game's use of Unreal Engine 5 alongside some quick snippets of tactical espionage action.\nWhile what's shown is definitely gameplay, it doesn't appear to be final as the trailer calls it the \"first in-engine look.\" Plus, the gameplay is watermarked with a \"pre-alpha footage\" tag.\nCheck out the Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, we see Big Boss sneaking through jungles, over wooden bridges, through World War 2-esque trenches, and more. There's nothing pointing toward the game's story in this trailer but it does make one thing clear: this remake is going to be beautiful if today's showing is any indication. And the gameplay looks solid and intact – exactly what you'd imagine a 2023 remake of this 2004 classic would look like. \nRevealed back in May, coincidentally during a PlayStation Showcase, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a from-the-ground-up remake of the third Metal Gear Solid game originally released in 2004. Like the original, this remake is a 1960s-era prequel to the Metal Gear series that tells the origin story of Big Boss.

A strange, alien-like tentacled form reaches up from beneath the roiling ocean waters – seemingly the source of the oil rig’s trouble. As the protagonist navigates the catwalks and beams of the rig, we hear distant and troubling screams. After traversing several tunnels, the first-person lead drops through a hatch into the very water that seems to be the source of the strange tendrils.\nThe Chinese Room is clearly interested in building atmosphere and tension in this trailer and, presumably, doing the same in the broader game. There’s clearly some awful threat at play aboard the rig, but its nature and what is happening to the others on board the rig remain a mystery.\nNonetheless, the first-person visuals and tense exploration are looking great, leaving us excited for the game’s launch on Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass) in early 2024.",

          "description": "Earlier this month, Sony revealed new slim models of its PlayStation 5 hardware. Both the disc drive and digital model are getting upgrades, but alongside this news, the company also revealed a new detachable disc drive. This optional drive can be added to a new slim model of the digital PS5, turning it into a console that can use discs. It seems this drive will require an internet connection to use, however. \nSome images of a potentially upcoming Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III slim PS5 bundle have leaked online (thanks, CharlierIntel) and in the small text on the box, it says, \"Internet connection required to pair Disc Drive and PS5 console upon startup.\"\nHey, @PlayStation & @cerny, we need to talk!\nhttps://t.co/GacpULuDu0 pic.twitter.com/IIF1iB2zgV\nOctober 25, 2023\nUnderstandably, many players and video game preservationists aren't enthused about the online requirement as there could come a day when the servers the console and disc drive attach to are offline, making the optional accessory useless. Given the text on the box, it sounds like the internet connection is a one-time thing, only needed to pair the disc drive with the console, but it's unclear if it's required after that. \nGame Informer has reached out to PlayStation to ask about the internet connection requirement and if a connection is required beyond initial setup; we will update this story if we learn more. \nThe same leaked images that you can see above also point to an unannounced Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III slim PS5 bundle that comes with the console, a DualSense controller, and the game.\nFor more, catch up on all the biggest Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III news from a recent COD Next livestream, and then read about how Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III won't come to Xbox Game Pass this year, even after Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard earlier this month.\nWhat do you think about this disc drive requiring an internet connection?

Textures and lighting have been enhanced, and controls have been modernized to support today’s gamepads. That includes platform-specific features such as gyro/motion controls, rumble, and a new weapon wheel. The cherry on top is that Dark Forces Remaster has achievements/trophies.\n\n\nDark Forces stars Kyle Katarn, a mercenary who defected from the Galactic Empire and joined the Rebel Alliance. He’s tasked with infiltrating the Empire and foiling its plans to create an army of powerful new stormtroopers and battle droids, better known as the Dark Trooper Project. It was the first Star Wars FPS game and is remembered as one of the better Doom-inspired games of the time. \nStar Wars: Dark Forces Remaster is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. You can watch some former GI editors play the original version in this classic episode of Replay, and learn about the making of Dark Forces in this retrospective feature.",

The publisher didn’t provide a breakdown in terms of physical vs digital, but that’s an impressive number for the PS5 exclusive.\nThis feat continues the series' record-setting trend; 2018's Spider-Man also became the fastest-selling first-party PS title at the time (for PS4 specifically with 3.3 million sold within the first three days of launch) and, later, became the best-selling superhero game ever in the U.S., a record it still holds today.

That changed recently when Konami finally revealed some plans for the franchise. Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is being remade and retitled Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, and the Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Volume 1 is releasing this week.\nThe collection contains the NES and MSX releases of Metal Gear, Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, Snake's Revenge, Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, and additional bonuses like soundtracks, scripts, and more. It's far from a complete collection of all things Metal Gear (hence the Volume 1 part of the title, presumably), but it arguably finally gives players access to the best of Metal Gear's past on modern consoles.

          "description": "Developer One More Level and publisher 505 Games have pulled back the DLC curtain plans for its upcoming first-person parkour-action game, Ghostrunner 2, ahead of its release next week. As previously announced, all Brutal Edition owners of Ghostrunner 2 will get the Season Pass, which includes all of the DLC announced today. Otherwise, the Season Pass will cost $19.99.\nAs for what to expect, One More Level has revealed four cosmetic packs and a new way to play the game called Endless Moto Mode. Given that we know Ghostrunner 2 features a motorbike for protagonist Jack to ride, we're guessing this new mode has something to do with that. In each cosmetic pack, players will receive three sword skins, three hand skins, and one motorcycle skin. The first one – Ice Pack – goes live in-game on December 7. \nCheck out the Ghostrunner 2 Season Pass trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nSometime in February, the Dragon Pack will go live followed by the Heat Pack in June of next year. The Endless Moto Mode is due out sometime in September of 2024, with the Anniversary Pack following it in October. \nBuying the Brutal Edition of Ghostrunner 2 gets you all of this DLC and 48-hours of early access to the game, meaning you can jump in starting October 24 ahead of the game's standard October 26 release date. \nFor more, check out the Ghostrunner 2 soundtrack list (and listen to a full song from it right now), and then watch this gameplay trailer from earlier this year.\nAre you jumping into Ghostrunner 2 next week? Let us know in the comments below!",

Paradox Rift features new Ancient and Future Pokémon, playing off a story element of the Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet games, as well as type-shifted Tera Pokémon EX cards to play off one of the core mechanics of the latest-generation video games. \nSpeaking of Pokémon EX cards, Paradox Rift offers more than 15 new Pokémon EX cards, but it doesn't stop there. Collectors and players alike can also expect more than 20 new Trainer cards, as well as 15 special illustration rare Pokémon and Supporter cards and 28 ultra rare full-art etched Pokémon EX and Supporter cards. There are even seven hyper-rare gold-etched cards to cross your fingers for.\nThe Pokémon Company sent along a bunch of booster packs from the Paradox Rift expansion for us to open in order to see what we could pull. After the last expansion focused squarely on the original 151 Pokémon, Paradox Rift largely shines the spotlight elsewhere (though a few Kanto creatures still show up). I loved the Yveltal and Garchomp EX cards I pulled, but my favorite is probably the Armarouge EX. I also loved the Ancient and Future Pokémon, but I'm disappointed the ones I pulled weren't foils. However, the gold-etched Iron Valiant EX card more than made up for that.\nCheck out my favorite pulls in the gallery below:\n\nPokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet – Paradox Rift arrives on store shelves on November 3.

It functions both as a great parody of anime characters who are constantly struggling to become stronger and as great action anime on its own. As a video game, however, it struggles somewhat as Saitama must defeat everyone in one punch, which isn't particularly fun gameplay, forcing you to play as the many other characters of the franchise, who sadly aren't Saitama.\nOne Punch Man: World is currently in closed beta and while it doesn't particularly solve any of those issues, it does look great and showcase some impressive action. It is a free-to-play game, though, which means there are gacha mechanics and lots of different currencies to deal with. Join Marcus Stewart and me as we check out the game and share our thoughts on the One Punch Man anime.\n\n\nHead over to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

We loved it – read Game Informer's review of it here – and are excited for everyone to get their hands on it. Yesterday, we learned Insomniac Games recommends players download the day one patch for the \"best experience\" before starting the first mission, and now, we've learned when to expect the fan-favorite New Game Plus feature in the sequel. \nAs first reported by PlayStation Lifestyle, someone asked Insomniac Games community director James Stevenson if New Game Plus and mission replay will be in the game at launch. Stevenson said, \"No, we're working on an update for those features but they won't be in Day 1.\"\nNo - we’re working on an update for those features but they won’t be in Day 1\nOctober 17, 2023\nAfter someone on Twitter expressed their disappointment in the replies, Stevenson clarified that New Game Plus was not a Day 1 feature in the original Marvel's Spider-Man, but instead a mode added roughly six weeks after launch. \nSomeone else asked Stevenson on Twitter if New Game Plus is coming this year or 2024 and Stevenson said it \"should be before end of year.\"\nShould be before end of year\nOctober 18, 2023\nSo if you're looking forward to replaying the story of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 with all of your favorite suits, gadgets, abilities, and more unlocked from the jump, it sounds like it could be just a month or two away. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 review and then read about the Marvel's Spider-Man 2 Day 1 patch. After that, check out Game Informer's spoiler-free tips to know before starting Marvel's Spider-Man 2. \nAre you jumping into Marvel's Spider-Man 2 tomorrow? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "The 7th Guest is a 1993 puzzle adventure game that was released on PCs in 1993, just a few months before Myst. It was an early instance of a fully modeled 3D location, and its use of FMV actors for its cast felt like you were looking into the future of video games. It received a few underwhelming sequels and other adaptions, but The 7th Guest VR marks arguably its biggest and boldest reimagining. Effectively a remake, this version of the game takes the familiar locations and story and adds in new puzzles and new performances. Considering the original game (and this remake) is about exploring a spooky house and solving puzzles, it feels at home in VR. You can watch Wes LeBlanc and me check out the game below.\nFor a whole lot more on The 7th Guest, you can read our oral history of the game right here. You can also take a look at this translated interview between Mario and Zelda creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, and Spirited Away director, Hayao Miyazaki, from the early 90s where Miyamoto called the game \"inspiring\".\n\n\nHead over to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

It did so for several reasons – its beautifully realized visuals, top-notch voice acting, and, of course, the potential to play as some of my favorite characters in a Metroidvania-esque adventure. That wasn't all, though; The snippets of composer David Housden's score in the reveal trailer indicated this team was on to something. \nIt was clear from the first listen that Housden and Dlala put a lot of effort into making Illusion Island sound like Disney. What's more, it replicated not just the broader stroke that anyone can hear and go, \"Oh, that sounds like Disney music,\" but instead created something wholly original that simultaneously sounded…",
