          "description": "Rayman is raving.\n2017’s Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle had one of the best DLCs we’ve ever seen a game starring Mario receive. The Donkey Kong Adventure story expansion saw Donkey Kong and Rabbid Cranky team up with Rabbid Peach to take on tons of reworked enemies and tons of tight, tactical challenges. It proved Ubisoft knew how to make a quality DLC. Thus far, this quality hasn’t extended to the DLC releases for the sequel, Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope – while both the Tower of Doooom and The Last Spark Hunter gave us more of what made Sparks of Hope great, they were just that: more of the same.\nWe had high hopes for the final DLC expansion titled Rayman in the Phantom Show. Not only have we not seen Ubisoft’s platforming poster boy in quite some time, but it looked like it might follow in Donkey Kong Adventure’s footsteps. However, after clearing the regrettably short story, it mirrors Sparks of Hope’s other lacklustre DLCs.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Now though, DDR5 manufacturers are also producing an intermediate 24GB size, allowing for 48GB kits of two sticks each.\nThis new capacity requires a BIOS update for most motherboards, but pricing on it can be quite good - and that's what we're seeing today, with extremely rapid DDR5-6400 CL36 RAM available in a 48GB capacity for $130 after a $18 price drop.  \nRead more",

Verne Colon The Shape Of Fantasy is, at least in part, an adventure game, and weaker for it. Taken as 'pure' interactive fiction, it'd be shorter and simpler, but might allow its premise, atmosphere, and intriguing world to shine the way they ought to.\r\n\n\r\nThe premise actually takes some explaining. Jules Verne himself takes the place of Aronnax, the protagonist of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Seas, and instead of mere hermitry, his new submarine home/prison is devoted to a guerrilla war against The Nation, a Prussian-ish empire you might be able to stop using a techno-magical gubbins that allows you to edit reality.

          "description": "Earlier this week I attended a hands-off preview for Owlcat's forthcoming CRPG Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, which is shaping up nicely, inasmuch as there's anything \"nice\" about a Warhammer 40,000 game. Rogue Trader is a party-based affair in which you play a sort of Warhammer East India Company, tasked with flipping outlying worlds to the Imperium. In order to carry out this goal, you're granted a lot more individual license than most human residents of the 40K universe. You can, for instance, recruit ungodly xenos to your grimdark troupe, operate a private armada, and even colonise planets and turn them into your own personal piggybank. Just watch you don't push the whole \"heresy\" thing too far.\r\n\n\r\nI'll have more for you on the subject soonish, but here's an interesting advance snippet from my interview with Owlcat's creative director Alexander Mishulin, in which we discussed what really distinguishes a CRPG from other kinds of role-playing game. According to Mishulin, it's all about designing for choices with consequences that genuinely run the entire length of the game, without (somehow) getting lost in the narrative undergrowth.\r\n\n \nRead more",

That's according to Bethesda's head of publishing Pete Hines, who encountered the displaced piscine trouble-maker while playing the game before release. He's \"almost positive\" the shark isn't there any more - and just like that, my understanding of Starfield has been transformed. This isn't a 150 hour RPG treadmill of resource extraction, artefact investigation and base-building, wherein you give spaceship tours and put +5% on your accuracy, or what-have-you. It's an extremely slowburn horror game, with every innocent elevator potentially housing a Great White jumpscare. All of which, Hines feels, is true to how Bethesda \"embraces chaos\" in their games, though he does feel the company's popular association with jank and bugs isn't \"particularly fair\".\nRead more",

The right pad, mind, also includes an optical sensor on the bottom, so you can swish it around a desk like a vertical mouse. Potentially a difference-maker for FPS games? We won’t need to wait long to find out, as the Legion Go is launching on October 31st. It’ll cost a surprisingly un-spooky £699 / $699.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I don't remember this at the time, but there were complaints about Skyrim's map when it came out, because it was just an extreme zoom out on the world. It wasn't dense with information; the map markers were often kind of an \"it's in this area\" guideline that were even less helpful if what you needed was in a barrow or otherwise underground. Starfield raises the bar by taking the bold step of having a map that is almost not a map.\nI'm referring here to the planet surface map. The starmap is, like a couple of things I've experienced since being hustled through quite an accelerated inciting incident (Starfield's equivalent of Patrick Stewart dying in a sewer after he's charged you with saving the world), reminiscent of Mass Effect. You can select different galaxies, which have one or two solar systems in them, and then can zoom down and select specific planets or moons or whatever to warp to. Once you're wombling about on the surface being a naughty little space captain - or whatever, I don't judge what you're up to - well baby, I hope you like blue voids with a bit of topography.\nRead more",

Having watched its game director Jon-Paul Dumont steer me through a 30-minute demo, I’ve come away with the impression it’s far more than just a cheap LOTR pretender.

          "description": "Over the past week, dataminers have been rifling through Baldur's Gate 3's code and have discovered a dragon's hoard of alleged \"cut content\". It's hard to specify what they've unearthed without accidentally sounding the Major Spoilers trumpet and initiating Armageddon, but the supposed buried offerings include additional areas, swathes of dialogue, storylines, cutscenes, characters, romance opportunities and even deities. Given just how much Larian's gargantuan RPG gives you to play with, I am kind of thankful for a generous amount of stuff being \"left out\" - certainly, I don't need any more romanceable NPCs, I'm already fending them off with a broomhandle. But the news has gone down badly with a few players, and especially those who feel the game's overall quality takes a dive in acts 2 and 3.\r\n\n\r\nDevelopers have come to Larian's defence, amongst them David Gaider, former Baldur's Gate 2 and Dragon Age writer, who is nowadays creative director of Summerfall Games, creator of the very earwormy STRAY GODs: The Roleplaying Musical. \"Not surprised to hear of the amount of stuff apparently cut from BG3,\" Gaider wrote on Twix. \"BG2 had a mountain of stuff cut over its development, some early and some even after lots of work had gone into it... almost every game does. Every DA game did. Heck, even Stray Gods had some considerable cuts.\"\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's a part of the world we don't often get to see in games, and its stunning pixel art (and tiny cute little llamas) instantly caught my eye when I got to play an early mission from it at last week's Gamescom. Made by four developers spread across the globe, the official genres listed on its Steam page describe it as a tactical turn-based action adventure RPG where you guide four separate heroes in their fight against the ominous sounding Red Company. But just saying it's turn-based is doing Arco a disservice, I think, as it's also a little bit real-time, a little bit simultaneous turns, and all pretty brilliant, if you ask me.

The system won't detect offences in real time, nor will it be able to kick you from games for effing and blinding. It just submits reports of bad behaviour, with Activision staff making the final call on enforcement actions, which might involve reviewing recordings to work out the context of an outburst.\nYou can turn off voice chat in Call of Duty to avoid being recorded, but it doesn't look like there's a way to opt out of AI voice moderation in the current/new Call of Duty games at the time of writing. The tech is being beta-tested from today, 30th August in Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone in North America, with the English-language worldwide release to land alongside Modern Warfare 3 on 10th November. \r\n\n \nRead more",

It cast you as an ancient warrior, resurrected by a flying robot to reclaim humankind's old dominions together with their antique, storied weapons and gear. So much of its appeal for me, back in 2014, was the mystique of that reclamation process, bolstered by alternately zany, obnoxious, fragmentary or intriguing writing that expanded upon the viral mythological element in Halo. \r\n\n\r\nFast-forward nine years, and Destiny 2 has turned the destruction and loss of history wrought by the Darkness into a seasonal - or as it's shortly to become, \"episodic\" - content \"cadence\" (a term that stems from the Latin word for falling) of erosion and restoration, with areas, weapons and quests stripped periodically from the game due to a mixture of technical pressures and commercial priorities. It's sort of become the very thing you're fighting, but where the Darkness aims to engulf and extinguish the Guardians of the Light, Destiny wants to keep you engaged.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Released on Steam this week, The London Case takes young Poirot to, err, London, charged with protecting a famous painting along with a representative of the insurance firm. Naturellement, the painting is stolen from an apparently locked room under everyone's silly noses, and thus begins Poirot and Hastings' first puzzle caper together (for who else is our insurance representative?).\nTechnically, of course, they met in The Mysterious Affair At Styles, when Captain Arthur Hastings was on leave from the front during WW1, but one of the things I like about this series is how it takes what it wants and gently buffs away the rest. If you're going to adapt, then adapt! Like The First Cases, which came out in 2021, the game itself is largely a process of pointing and clicking through crime scenes to find clues, and then joining them in a big mind map akin to what you'd find in a Frogwares Sherlock Holmes game. But having Hastings along does make it a bit more fun, because his role is to be a bit of an idiot.\nRead more",

Immortal, which launched last year as a free-to-play MMO game, left quite a bad taste in our mouths when it launched on PC, especially when it came to the prohibitively high cost of its various microtransactions. Despite this, though, the game's continued to enjoy great success over on mobile, but even Blizzard weren't sure whether its popularity would last once Diablo 4 arrived.\n\"One of the things that we were kind of nervous about initially was that when Diablo 4 landed it would sort of cannibalise Immortal, and that everyone was just going to be, 'Oh we're just playing Immortal until Diablo 4 comes out',\" Fergusson told me at Gamescom. As it turns out, they needn't have been so apprehensive. \"In fact, it was the opposite,\" he says.\nRead more",

In this reinvention - which, confusingly, is also a sequel to Stuffed Wombat's Qomp, with the Pong branding sort of ladled on top - the homely pixel ball has shattered one player's paddle and escaped into an Axiom Verge-esque labyrinth of spikes, energy beams and floating T-Rex heads. Filing this premise somewhere on the \"what if\" spectrum between the Edge line about talking to the monsters in DOOM and people demanding to land on gas giants in Starfield.

          "description": "Released in 2006, Dark Messiah Of Might And Magic made the most of still-novel physics tech by letting you torment orcs with slippy floors, collapsing log piles, and swift kicks directly into spikes. These slapstick delights made it a cult classic, but rights-holders Ubisoft haven't done much with the game since.\r\n\nNow a group of modders have been given a \"completely blank check\" by Ubisoft to do what they want with their efforts to build a modding SDK for the nearly 20-year-old game, and their ambitions include co-op and raytracing.\r\n\n \nRead more",

But what exactly is Thank Goodness You're Here!? Well, having played through one of its 15 minute missions now, I can tell you it's a bit like Untitled Goose Game, in that you have a village you can wander about in causing chaos, but it's also much more structured than that, with specific quests and people to help as you guide your tiny travelling salesman through its surreal neighbourhood.

          "description": "You may have noticed a mounting squabble between Starfield fans and detractors concerning the game's planetary maps, triggered by some leaks or fake leaks over the past week. Said skirmish has now escalated to \"-gate\" status, with \"Tilegate\" doing the rounds on forums and even creeping into search results, presumably much to the alarm of innocent, unaligned ceramics company Tilegate Trading Llc in Florida. The nub of the dispute seems to be thus: some people claim the procedurally generated tiles that comprise many Starfield environments actually glue together into complete globes, so that you can see and walk from one to the other and, indeed, all around the equator, while others claim they're discrete maps with invisible walls, similar to those of the astonishing \"dreamable\" space sim Noctis. \r\n\n\r\nWho knows, we might have an under-embargo Starfield review in the works that will lay matters to rest. In the short term, the uncertainty about whether Starfield's planets are actually planets puts me in mind of comparable celestial angst in Bethesda's Elder Scrolls games, where planets are more properly described as planes of existence, conjured by immortal beings, which sort of orbit the mortal world of Tamriel. I've been revisiting how Bethesda's mainstay fantasy games thought about outer space in the run-up to Starfield, and while I'm intrigued by the new game's portrayals of celestial mechanics (latest discovery: the Starfield starmap represents stellar and planetary gravity as dimples on a kind of galactic tarpaulin, as in old Stephen Hawking documentaries), I'll be very surprised if it offers anything quite as wonderfully bizarre.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The intention is that a season and a patch would go [live] the same day, so at the time we make a balance change and you start a level one character, it feels differently to go through the progression with the new balance.\"\nRead more",

Blargh. I'm more confident picking my favourite space derelict, which would include choice excerpts from the debris field of trashed starcraft you traverse in the otherwise-questionable Dead Space 3. I'm hoping for more of that kind of thing in Starfield, in which you'll encounter a wide range of scuttled vessels plus still-crewed, decidedly hostile \"Legendary\" ships that could play a part in the hotly upcoming Bethextravaganza's capacious endgame.

          "description": "But you know. In a good way. My waking hours are, currently, beset by stress and anxiety from a number of different directions, and I've only had time to play about about an hour of Mediterranea Inferno so far. It's quite a short game, though, and I'm sort of transfixed. It's about three men in their early 20s who, pre-pandemic, were the toast of their party scene in Milan, and after a couple of years apart enforced by a lockdown they're reuniting for a summer mini-break. Having blazed through my early 20s I no longer really remember that unique, potent mix of feeling simultaneously fragile and invincible, but it's captured in this almost occult, yet hyper-real visual novel.\nI may be playing on a Steam Deck on a rainy day, but the bold colour contrasts and the desperate enthusiasm of the dialogue really get over the feeling of a too-hot summer, of trying to force fun and recapture a friendship when you all want different things. The most intense segments of Mediterranea Inferno are the Mirages, visions that merge past and present and metaphor, giving explicit form to each character's wants and anxieties. It's unreal and yet a distillation of reality. It's quite an intense ride so far, but it's a good one.\nRead more",

          "description": "I like Warframe, Digital Extremes’ shockingly enduring free-to-play action RPG, but I do find its sci-fantasy direction a bit much. The mashing together of tinted alloys and astral flame, the blend of over-the-shoulder shooting and swordplay, the environments that occasionally look like GPU boxart on steroids – it’s impressive, but a lot to digest. \nThe Canadian developer’s new project Soulframe has the same sense of swagger, with menus consisting of beautiful, quasi-medieval illustrations decorated with scrolls and dancing figures. But it’s a quieter thrill, a stately and absorbing world of hazy forests and sun-pierced catacombs, which calls to mind both Dragon’s Dogma and the overlooked tiny MMO Book of Travels. After catching a hands-off presentation in advance of this year’s Tennocon, I am pretty keen to play.\nRead more",

Alas, \"Last Wednesday\" was a regular Dark Age, and we dusty ancients were granted only a partial glimpse of the promised new areas, weapons, cosmetics and story content, Digital Extremes having reserved some of the key reveals for a happier period, \"Today\" - which, according to our most trusted seers, will be an era of understanding and transparency.

Countdown to fiding the first penis-shaped coaster starts now.\nThe game already encouraged designing borderline cruel rides that pushed health and safety regulations, but the upcoming DLC Beyond eXtreme takes things one step further with contraptions that shake punters around like a fizzy drink, among new maps, rides and scenery items. On a side note, I’ve thought the game’s previous trailers were quietly creepy and the latest is no different. Maybe it’s the playground jingle in the background, or maybe I’m just sensitive to enthusiastic announcer voices. Take a look.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Devs GSC Game World are going through an unimaginably difficult time right now on top of leaks and hacker attacks. That has to be taken into account when we think about the development of the game, and it could be why, after 20-minutes spent exploring a bit of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart Of Chornobyl's irradiated world, I'm unsure what to make of it.\nMaybe I played a very early build, but while the world itself looks every bit the eerie post apocalyptic survival wasteland you hope, NPC interactions aren't in as great shape. Chats with friendlies are unclear, and in firefights the enemy AI is shonky - to the extent that I think it'll be more useful as a preview to just tell you exactly what happened to me as I played.\nRead more",

          "description": "I will hold my hands up and say that I didn't get on too well with One More Level's first Ghostrunner game. While its one-hit-kill combat was fast, flashy and infinitely more appealing than some of the other neon lambs being led to the cyberpunk slaughter in the back end of 2020, its precise platforming and marksman-grade enemies made it a hard game to love while you were actually playing it. But having sat down for 45 minutes with Ghostrunner 2 at this year's Gamescom, I'm pleased to report that this is a sequel done right, building on everything you know and (probably) love about the first game, while also ushering in new, optional concessions to help make its still wonderfully gory swordplay much more approachable for old two-left-thumbs-McGee over here. Then there's the motorbike, which… phwoar. Let me tell you about the motorbike.\nRead more",

This little handheld that couldn't served as Sony's last major handheld before the company shifted all its focus onto console games.\nIt's a sad story of a console with unfulfilled potential because I think it's one of the best handhelds ever. It's also one with a creator who had no idea what to do with it.\nWhen the Vita was alive but floundering, Sony had the baffling idea to launch a micro-console using Vita hardware. Mircoconsoles were a phenomenon that only sparked the interest of various companies as the public did not care. While Nvidia's Shield still exists, the Ouya became famous for failing, and Sony's machine was forgotten. Unf…",

The announcement was made as part of the famed purple dragon’s 25th anniversary celebration, leading up to Spyro Community Day on September 8. \nhttps://twitter.com/SpyroTheDragon/status/1697658224348967118\nAccording to a post on Twitter by user @Canadianguyehh, which was retweeted in solidarity by the Spyro the Dragon account, Spyro Community Day is meant as a celebration of the beloved mascot. Fans are encouraged to “show off some new art, tell your favorite story, Speed run, Livestream the game, cry for a sequel, and everything in-between!”\nIn addition to this significant sales milestone, the team behind the Reignited Trilogy has made the game’s soundtrack available via Spotify. With 45 songs from across the three games, it’s sure to get you in the mood to boot the game up — which you can now do in the Nintendo Switch Blockbuster Sale, where the Reignited Trilogy can be picked up for 60% off its normal price.\nWill there be a new Spyro game?\nIt should be asked if this celebration could result in the announcement of something new for the Spyro series. As of writing, nothing has been confirmed, but if this announcement is any indication, the fans really want another adventure with the wisecracking purple dragon.\nIf anything more is announced—be it a new game, or a remaster of Enter the Dragonfly—in the lead-up to Spyro Community Day, we’ll be certain to update this page accordingly. \nThe post Spyro Reignited Trilogy sells 10 million appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s an interesting game, which I’ll get to in a bit. However, I quickly grabbed the cartoon to watch and maybe gave up after two episodes. I know that two episodes is a pretty brief amount of time to try and form an opinion on a show, but I couldn’t stand it. It was a horrible maelstrom of bad attempts at wordplay and nauseating self-righteousness.\nThe ship that the eponymous Bucky pilots is called the Righteous Indignation, which really tells you all you need to know about the show’s tonality.\nThe cartoon was based on a comic from the late ‘70s, but it’s one of those shows that were pretty obvious in their intention to sell toys.

          "description": "Fans of shooting and floating, take note, because Gunbrella has a launch date. The latest from Doinksoft is set for September 13, 2023 on Nintendo Switch and PC. Described as a \"gritty side-scrolling adventure,\" Gunbrella certainly looks the part in the new release date trailer.\nOkay, it's actually somehow kind of cute, too? Maybe it's the music, or maybe it's the monster that looks like a berserk Tetsuo from the climax of Akira. Whatever horrors your woodsman ends up facing, there's one constant that remains. He'll do so with a gun that is also an umbrella, and that's that. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWWtajLd_0c\nGhouls 'n gangsters\nThe titular firearm isn't just about shooting, gliding, and dashing; it can also be used for close-quarters combat. There aren't many enemies I've seen so far that I'd like to get close to, but I don't think we'll have much of a say in the matter. If you're keen on seeing how this one plays for yourself, a demo is available on both platforms.\nThose who pre-order will get a free copy of 2019's best entry in the cat-in-armored-mech sub-genre, Gato Roboto. The black and white side-scroller is one of those games you can beat in a single sitting if you're up for it, and it's worth playing. It's simple enough, but it looks like Gunbrella is aiming for something on a much larger scale. \nPublisher Devolver Digital is on a roll when it comes to things mixed with guns. The wildly different Wizard with a Gun launches just one month after this one. \nThe post Gunbrella launches on September 13, pre-orders come with free Gato Roboto appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Get ready for throwback action because developer Maple Powered Games is working on a new G.I. Joe beat 'em up. The studio announced G.I. Joe: Wrath of Cobra with Q1 2024 release plans on Nintendo Switch, PC, Mac, and Linux via Steam, Epic Games Store, and GOG. \nG.I. Joe: Wrath of Cobra promises both online and couch co-op for up to four players in Story and Arcade Mode. Duke, Scarlett, Snake Eyes, Roadblock, and other classic characters are getting in on it, so you can shelve your figures for a while after launch. A trailer accompanied Maple Powered Games' announcement, providing an idea of how the retro-style brawler looks. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tHrCaYrDd4\nThe forces of nostalgia are firing on all cylinders. There's music from Tee Lopes (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge) with vocals from Crush 40 vocalist Johnny Gioeli. We've also got rough animation that honors the stupendously goofy spirit of the G.I. Joe cartoon. Then it all ends with a quick dash of in-development gameplay footage, which looks like a slightly slower beat 'em up in the vein of The Punisher or Captain America. \n[caption id=\"attachment_401202\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot via Freedom Games[/caption]\nWherever there's trouble\nSome locales planned for Wrath of Cobra include G.I. Joe headquarters, \"The Pit,\" Cobra Island, and Cobra's secret underwater base. You won't get much of a feel for it from the trailer, but apparently Wrath of Cobra sports a parry system. That should come in handy when dealing with enemies like Ninja Vipers, the Crimson Guard, and HISS Tanks. Man, I'd say I miss '80s toys, but you can literally go to Target and pick up exact replicas right now. \nHowever this turns out, at least it's likely to have a killer soundtrack. I don't know that it will reach the heights of the villainous twist theme song from 1987's G.I. Joe: The Movie, but there's plenty of time to dream big.\nThe post Retro GI Joe beat ’em up Wrath of Cobra announced for 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Bethesda’s new title, Starfield, is currently only available for players who bought the premium edition, but that hasn’t stopped it from being played by over 200,000 concurrent users.\nThere are more people playing Starfield right now than there are populating the city I live in. That’s not entirely surprising, as it’s one of the most anticipated releases of the year. It’s always a big event when Bethesda drops a new open-world title, whether it’s Elder Scrolls, Fallout, or a new IP like Starfield.\nHowever, for comparison, right now as I write this, last month’s big game, Baldur’s Gate 3, has over 400,000 concurrent players. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, on the other hand, has 1.2 million people on its servers right now. That’s obscene. Does this mean that Starfield isn’t as nova-hot as many expected? No. Right now, a lot of people are waiting for the Xbox Game Pass version to play or were simply unwilling to pony up for the Premium Edition.\nI sure as heck wasn’t. I’ve not played the game yet, though I hear it’s fantastic. I’m just not that hyped for it. I probably would be over-jazzed if it was Elder Scrolls or Fallout, but those are universes I’m already well-invested in. I’ve played space exploration games before and still do occasionally. I’ve never thought to myself, “this would be better if it was more like Elder Scrolls.” That’s not to say I don’t think Starfield will be good, or that I’m not at all interested in playing it – I’ll definitely be firing it up once it’s on Game Pass.\nWhat I am saying is that I’m more likely to be found playing the games I’ve pulled out of a dumpster than one that clocks over 200K users at once. In other words, I have no taste.\nStarfield will be available for PC and Xbox on September 6, 2023.

In celebration of the MMO's 10th anniversary, Square Enix is launching a new line of liquor as part of a collaboration event in Japan.\nThanks to @Aitaikimochi on Twitter, we've got a glimpse at the FFXIV whiskey labels and the starting cities they're repping. Apparently, it comes in three variants with labels for Gridania, Limsa Lominsa, and Ul'dah from Nagahama Distillery.\nHow to get the FFXIV Whiskey\n[caption id=\"attachment_401168\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Square Enix and Nagahama Distillery[/caption]\nThe Amahagan whiskey collection comes from the Japanese department store Isetan and is one of several items available in its anniversary collection, A Decade's Journey. On September 28, both the Shinjuku location and its online store will sell goodies from its FFXIV anniversary event. Bottles cost $60 USD—easily five times the price of my usual wine.\nFor international buyers, you'll have a harder time. Shipping alcohol between borders is a pain, and it looks like Isetan's international shipping vendor doesn't work in this case. However, you may still have better luck once the event begins with other collaboration goodies. I'm kind of eyeing the Warrior of Darkness shirt myself, and don't laugh at my Mother Crystal earrings.\n[caption id=\"attachment_401169\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Square Enix and Isetan[/caption]\nIn 2021, the MMO launched its very own Reaper-themed wine shortly after Endwalker made its debut.

          "description": "It’s impressive when someone manages to create a beloved game experience on their own; or at the very least with a small team. Such was the case with Stardew Valley, and its developer Eric Barone, also known by the pseudonym \"ConcernedApe.\" What’s even more impressive than that, though, is how that experience was converted into a highly coveted board game. While Stardew Valley: The Board Game was available for a limited run, it's coming back very soon.\nhttps://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1696958789717803020\nAccording to a social media post from ConcernedApe themselves, a new printing of Stardew Valley: The Board Game will be available for pre-order on September 5. Units are expected to be shipped in \"October\" of 2023. ConcernedApe clarified in the replies that each copy will set players back $50 USD, but shipping will be free. \nAccording to the game’s official website, they will only be shipped to addresses in the US, but select game stores in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the EU, and the UK may have copies available.\nStardew Valley: The Board Game is a cooperative, multiplayer game where you and a group of farmers will work together to save the titular valley from the evil Joja Corporation. Players can farm, fish, and acquire resources to make protecting the magical Stardew Valley much easier. \nHow long does it take to play Stardew Valley: The Board Game?\nAccording to the game’s official website, it will take approximately 45 minutes per player to play Stardew Valley: The Board Game. The team behind the tabletop edition has emphasized its general challenge level, and “if your game group or family prefers short playtimes (less than 45 minutes) with a small number of rules and components, this game might not be a good fit,” so take from that what you will!\nThe post A new round of Stardew Valley board game pre-orders is coming appeared first on Destructoid.",

Sometimes, new chores mean I’m committing to the same monotonous routine for months, and sometimes that means I’m queuing up for duties long-abandoned, like the MMO’s MOBA-like PvP mode, Rival Wings.\nWhen it comes to achievement hunting, I’m one of those people.

          "description": "Following a release on PC in February of 2023, Sunsoft has announced that Ikki Unite will launch on Switch in North America in early 2024. Japan will get it slightly earlier in 2023.\nIkki Unite is a bit of a weird one. It is based on a 1985 arcade game that was ported to Famicom in the same year. The Famicom version is considered one of Japan’s “kusoge no densetsu” or “legendary crappy game.” However, rather than try and duplicate the reviled gameplay of the 1985 “classic,” Ikki Unite has a lot more in common with Vampire Survivors. Specifically, it involves hordes of monsters and powering up your auto-firing attacks. The big wrinkle here is that it’s 16-players online.\nI played some of Ikki Unite back when it first released on PC. It was fun, but at the time it was unbalanced and buggy. Sunsoft has patched it a few times since then, and I keep meaning to jump back in to see if they polished out the experience. Its roguelite multi-player gameplay just seemed kind of fascinating to me at the time, but I recall it being a very busy period for me, so I didn’t get a chance to put much time into it.\nWhile details on the Switch release is somewhat sparse, Sunsoft is saying that it will have full crossplay with the current PC version. That’s pretty important. You wouldn’t want to divide the player base of such a niche game.\nIkki Unite is available on PC right now. It will be coming to Switch sometime in early 2024.\nThe post Sunsoft kusoge atonement game Ikki Unite arrives on Switch next year appeared first on Destructoid.",

That damned “onward and upward” that one spews at Mario is locked in a very painful spot in my mind. It’s like having a grain of sand between the folds of brain, slowly aggravating everything around it in small but significant ways.\nThankfully, Nintendo’s own Japanese blog has shared a screenshot that reveals a setting specifically for the “Talking Flower Voice.” While it doesn’t specifically say what settings are available, I’m going to assume that if there is a setting for “voice,” then there is likely one for “no voice.”\nWhat’s funny about Nintendo’s post is that it seems to assume that people are going to want the flowers to talk to incessantly spew their insipid hints in their sharply saccharine voices. They suggest that their voices will make a lively adventure even more lively.\n[caption id=\"attachment_401076\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Nintendo[/caption]\nListen, Nintendo. I don’t know how to describe it, but these talking flowers have very punchable voices. They talk like a dude who is trying to impress a single mother by talking to her child. Their voices drip with cartoonish insincerity that makes me want to ruin their day by telling them the saddest story in my arsenal. If someone stepped out of a cafe and spoke to me in that voice, I would intentionally spill their drink on them, snatch the donut from their hands, and consume it right in front of them.\nSo, thankfully, you can turn it off.\nSuper Mario Bros.

This time, you’ll be tasked with cleaning the grime off of the ‘80s hit movie Back to the Future.\nAfter finally clawing its way out of the muck of Early Access in 2022, PowerWash Simulator has crossed over with a number of properties. This includes games like Tomb Raider and Final Fantasy VII remake and, most recently, Spongebob Squarepants. There’s even a Warhammer 40K crossover lined up.\nReleased in 1985, Back to the Future is one of the most recognizable ‘80s movies. It involves teenager Marty McFly being stranded in the distant past year of 1955. If you want to see anyone over 30 fall to pieces, just remind them that if Back to the Future was made today, Marty would travel back to 1993. Hold on, I… I need to sit down for a second.\nhttps://youtu.be/AWWr1MrrjtA?feature=shared\nThe Back to the Future DLC will include “Doc Brown’s van, the Time Machine, Hill Valley Clocktower, the Holomax Theatre, and Doc’s Time Train. Plus, there are ten new achievements to collect in-game.” Damn, I was kind of hoping to hose off a J.C. Penney sign.\nIn any case, the Back to the Future DLC will arrive for PowerWash Simulator sometime in 2023. The bad news is that it will cost money. Specifically, you’ll need $7.99 USD for the privilege of cleaning off the DeLorean. That’s not something I expected to be writing today.\nThe post PowerWash Simulator is crossing over with Back to the Future appeared first on Destructoid.",

Well, it turns out the Legion GO is actually happening, and it's coming out at the end of October.\nIn a recent report from GamesRadar+, The upcoming Lenovo machine will be launching this Halloween (literally October 31) and judging from the hardware, it could topple the Steam Deck. However, as always with these more premium gaming devices, there's the price to consider.\nhttps://youtu.be/BLD-dg1C_XU\nAccording to the report, the Legion GO will set you back $799. But hopefully, that extra dosh will be going towards something that can rival the best mobile gaming PCs around.\nWhat's under the hood?\nWhile it will sport 16GB of RAM, similar to the Steam Deck, the overall hardware of the Legion GO looks a little more impressive. For example, the former boasts an AMD RDNA 2 graphics chip, but the latter will utilize the more up-to-date RDNA 3. The GO also comes with 512GB of storage and an SD slot that can hold up to 2TB. Again, similar to the Deck, but that's only if you pay for the more expensive version of Valve's device.\nLenovo's machine will run on Windows 11 as opposed to it being a Linux-based system. It's up to you to decide whether a mobile PC using Windows is a good thing or not, but at least you can be more confident that games will be compatible out of the box.\nCheck out Lenovo's website if you want more information on the Legion GO. Also, check out the above launch trailer, which showcases some of the interesting features it has, including Switch-like controllers, a stronger battery, and AR capabilities.\nThe post Steam Deck alternative Lenovo Legion GO is real, coming October appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you thought Diablo 4 would be a nail in the coffin for its mobile-focused counterpart Diablo Immortal, think again. In an interview with RPS, Diablo 4 executive producer Rod Fergusson explains that the popularity of Diablo Immortal has only increased since the release of DIablo 4.\n\"One of the things that we were kind of nervous about initially was that when Diablo 4 landed it would sort of cannibalise Immortal, and that everyone was just going to be, 'Oh we're just playing Immortal until Diablo 4 comes out',\" Fergusson told RPS at Gamescom. \"In fact, it was the opposite. With each beta we did for Diablo 4, the more people started playing Immortal. Then once D4 launched, the same thing. Immortal continues to be successful, so we found that because that idea of playing on my couch in my living room or at my desk vs I'm playing on my phone in the car or while I'm waiting for my coffee or whatever, there was a place for both games to co-exist and they co-exist well.\"\"\n\nThe first part of this isn't much of a surprise. It makes sense that players hyped for D4 would be looking to play a similar title as the release approached. But what is shocking is that even after its launch, the popularity of Immortal has continued to increase.\nAre players happy with Immortal or unhappy with Diablo 4?\nPersonally, Immortal was way too gimmicky and cash-grabby for me. That being said, it's hard to argue that gameplay-wise it felt better than I had expected for a mobile title.\nImmortal also recently released the first new class in the Diablo franchise in over a decade. I have to admit, the class looks fun and unique, so part of the uptick in players for Immortal is people trying the new class.\nIn all fairness though, this may be more attributed to players current unhappiness with the state of Diablo 4. Hopefully, we continue seeing improvements with D4 with Season 2, Season of Blood, which starts on October 17.\nThe post Blizzard says Diablo 4 bolstered Diablo Immortal’s success appeared first on Destructoid.",

Some people have been waiting in the wings for this day, and now we can enjoy the start of something quite special.\nA quick look on Nexus Mods reveals that the Starfield community is already hard at work. At the time of writing, there are currently 59 mods for the game. Bear in mind, Bethesda's brand-new title hasn't fully released yet, only becoming available to Premium Edition purchasers very recently.\n[caption id=\"attachment_400970\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"] Image via FrancisLouis/Nexus Mods.[/caption]\nAt the moment, there isn't anything new in terms of fan-made content. But you'll find an array of tweaks (mostly of a graphical nature), translations, and new menu backgrounds.\nIf you build it, they will mod\nFor example, user Scottyus1 has released a Starfield reshade mod, which \"adds more detail to the world making all them textures pop and stand out more,\" while FrancisLouis goes the opposite direction and makes the game \"potato\" quality, with PS1-style visuals.\nProbably one of the most impressive mods so far comes from LukeFZ. They've managed to make it possible to replace AMD's upscaling tech (FSR2) for Nvidia's DLSS or even Intel's XeSS. Given that Starfield partnered with AMD, this particular mod could be a welcome one for those who don't use Team Red's hardware.\nAs time goes on, we're only going to see more and more custom modifications come out of the woodwork.

          "description": "It's a week since the successful launch of Armored Core 6, and already the internet has been flooded with some of the most amazing mech creations. Some issues have also unfortunately arisen, and they could potentially affect your save game.\nhttps://twitter.com/fromsoftware_sp/status/1697091028241793386\nFromSoftware recently sent out a Tweet acknowledging the issue. A translation of the Tweet reveals that the studio is aware of a bug that causes data to not be saved properly under certain circumstances. While the issue is being sorted, the studio advises you to close the game before putting your PC to sleep.\n[caption id=\"attachment_400948\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot by Destructoid.[/caption]\nFromSoftware is investigating the issue\nThis isn't the first time FromSoftware has struggled with save file issues. When Elden Ring launched in 2022, some players experienced save issues on PS5 and PC, though the studio did release a fix. Elden Ring unfortunately had other issues on PC that affected performance, and they also needed to be addressed by patches.\nSome Reddit users on the Armored Core subreddit have complained about the game not properly saving their progress, suggesting the problem isn't exceptionally rare. The problem is worsened by the fact that AC6 doesn't have multiple save slots, leaving you reliant on one precious save file. This makes it even more important to follow FromSoftware's advice until the bug is patched out.\nThe post Armored Core 6 has PC save issues, From Software investigating appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It's officially Starfield Day. At least for those who pre-ordered the Premium Edition (or those were lucky enough to get review copies). In the closing days before the game was released, Bethesda's own Todd Howard took to the community to express his gratitude at the loyalty and enthusiasm fans were showing.\nIn a recent post on Reddit, Mr. Skyrim himself wanted to personally thank the Starfield sub for all their support. His heartfelt message to the fans shows how grateful Howard is to witness such a dedicated following grow over the years.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/165kcki/from_all_of_us_here_thank_you/\nHe goes on to say that the Starfield – and Bethesda in general – fanbase contains \"gaming’s smartest fans,\" adding that the long-awaited sci-fi RPG has been a \"labor of love\" for him and his team.\nMaybe we CAN explore space together\nRead Howard's message however you want. Some may chortle a bit about how he refers to gamers – especially Reddit users – as being smart. We've long known about the divides among the community and some of the questionable opinions of a vocal minority. But Starfield's director evidently sees through that. We obviously don't know how sincere Howard was when he wrote that message, but given his passion for the new Bethesda game (especially considering he pitched it in 2013), the man's allowed to gush a little.\nThe reviews for Starfield are coming in all the time. But for those of us who have to wait until September 6 to play it, we might want to avoid social media for the next few days.\nThe post Todd Howard calls Starfield community ‘gaming’s smartest fans’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

The gunslinger from developer Galvanic Games thankfully didn't get the spotlight in the recent Devolver Delayed showcase, so look for this one to launch on October 17.\nThose who pre-order can lock in the exclusive Noble Wizard Pack. The gear within includes Wizard King and Jester outfits, as well as a bonus hat. Wizards wouldn't be wizards without hats, after all. You can see more in the new trailer below and check out a demo for a limited time. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqi9690iBK4\nWizzrobe\nWizard with a Gun was first revealed back in June 2021 during Devolver's typically madcap E3 showcase. Customization is the name of the game as you attempt to survive in a magical wilderness alone or with some friendly online assistance. The biomes—from deserts and swamps to open prairies—are procedurally generated and can be reset from your tower. If fashion is your thing, well, saddle up, pardner. Devolver shared a quick peek at the aforementioned bonus gear:\n[caption id=\"attachment_400869\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Devolver Digital[/caption]\nPlaying off that customization, it sounds like experimentation is going to be a major component. Spell combinations affect enemies and the world in different ways. Trying out new things will either lead to great success (and destruction) or utter failure. Success is alright, but failure is always funny. \nGalvanic Games previously released titles like Gurgamoth and Some Distant Memory. We'll get a chance to take aim at Wizard with a Gun when it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam on October 17 for $24.99.\nThe post Wizard with a Gun launches its co-op gunslinging survival on October 17 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Developer This I Dreamt and newfound publishing partner Serenity Forge announced today that Long Gone Days will hit PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch on October 10, 2023.\nThis RPG follows Rourke, who has spent his life training to become a sniper for The Core. But after embarking on his first mission, his life changes, and he deserts to try to stop all the bloodshed.\nLong Gone Days has a mix of narrative story, turn-based RPG battles, and an almost Silent Scope-esque sniping minigame that all blend for a pretty different kind of RPG. You can see all of this in action in the new trailer out today:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyHjKjGpt3w\nLong Gone Days will launch digitally at a price point of $24.99.\nDays gone\nThis particular game is one I've had my eye on for a while now. It's been around in some form for years, either as a demo or in Early Access on Steam. Seeing This I Dreamt team up with a publishing partner and get the ball rolling on a launch is the perfect excuse to share with y'all just why I'm interested in it.\nIf the setting and idea didn't draw you in, Long Gone Days is a wartime RPG that's critical of war. The game's interests keenly lie in ideas like language barriers, conflict, and its effect on civilians. Plus, it's got a nice side of slice-of-life chatter to break up its tactical combat. Everything about this RPG is different in a way that's really appealing to me, as someone who already plays a ton of RPGs.\nWe haven't been hurting for good RPGs this year, and Long Gone Days will hopefully keep the streak going. We'll find out which way the war goes when Long Gone Days arrives for PC, Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One on October 10.\nThe post Wartime RPG Long Gone Days aims for an October release appeared first on Destructoid.",

I’m roughly 23 hours in, so I still have many galaxies ahead of me, but read Game Informer’s Starfield review for in-depth thoughts on the overall package. With years of build-up and anticipation, I, like many Bethesda Game Studios fans, let my imagination run wild with what this new open world RPG could be. Now that I’ve played a decent chunk of it, it’s quite different from the studios’ Elder Scrolls and Fallout series in some ways. Those two franchises are significantly more open world than Starfield. In fact, Starfield feels more like a great sci-fi theme park with exciting points of interests rather than an open world adventure. But players looking for a replica space-based Fallout or Elder Scrolls adventure might …",

Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign. Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. \nAfter 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.\nJoin editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up. \nPart 1 - Surpr-iced! \nPart 2 - Bringing The Smoke\nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

It also revealed that each subscription tier of PlayStation Plus is getting a significant price bump.\nThe PlayStation Blog reveals that September’s free games will be 2022’s Saints Row, Black Desert - Traveler Edition, and Generation Zero. They’ll become available on September 5 and can be downloaded until October 2.\nOn September 6, 12-month subscriptions for PlayStation Plus Essential, Extra, and Premium will be raised to the following prices:\nEssential - $79.99 (from $59.99)\nExtra - $134.99 (from $99.99)\nPremium - $159.99 (from $119.99)\nYou can read this article for a refresher on the benefits of each subscription tier, which will not be changing. Current 12-month subscribers will not see these prices take effect until their next renewal date occurring on or after November 6. Changing your membership (such as buying more time or upgrading/downgrading tiers) on or after September 6 means paying the new prices, though. Sony also states that the new prices remain at a discounted rate compared to the single or three-month options. Sony has not revealed the new monthly/quarterly rates.\nIn the blog post, Sony explains the changes by stating, “This price adjustment will enable us to continue bringing high-quality games and value-added benefits to your PlayStation Plus subscription service.” It’s worth noting that, for now, Sony has not announced any new, additional benefits following the pricing updates.\nThe move comes at a time when several streaming and subscription services have raised their fees, so it’s not entirely surprising.

Bethesda announced the new IP way back in 2018 and after more than five years of waiting, it’s set to launch on Xbox Series X/S and PC next week, on September 6. Based on what Bethesda’s revealed about the sci-fi RPG, it looks set to be the developer Bethesda Game Studios’ biggest game yet. Hitting up its hundreds of planets while fighting space pirates, marines, and more will also require a decent PC build. \n\n\nHere are the PC specifications for Starfield: \nMinimum: \nOS: Windows 10 version 21H1 (10.0.19043)\nProcessor: AMD Ryzen 5 2600X, Intel Core i7-6800K\nMemory: 16 GB RAM\nGraphics: AMD Radeon RX 5700, NVIDIA GeForce 1070 Ti\nDirectX: Version 12\nStorage: 125 GB available space\nAdditional Notes: SSD Required\nRecommended: \nOS: Windows 10/11 with updates\nProcessor: AMD Ryzen 5 3600X, Intel i5-10600K\nMemory: 16 GB RAM\nGraphics: AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080\nDirectX: Version 12\nNetwork: Broadband Internet connection\nStorage: 125 GB available space\nAdditional Notes: SSD Required\nAs you can see, not only is Starfield a large game, needing 125 GB of free space, but it will also require that much space on an SSD. And you’ll want a pretty powerful graphics card and processor to run it at its best, too. \nStarfield hits Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Game Pass on September 6. However, if you preorder the Digital Premium Edition, the Premium Edition Upgrade (which you can purchase if you plan on playing the game through Game Pass), or the Constellation Edition, you can hop into the game up to five days early, starting August 31. \nWhile waiting for the game to launch, check out the Starfield Direct from earlier this summer for more than 40 minutes of footage and check out this special edition Starfield Xbox Series X console wrap afterward. \nAre you picking up Starfield early or jumping in on September 6?

While movie/comic fans likely know him best from his portrayal of Bobby Drake/Iceman in the X-Men film series, Remedy fans were previously acquainted with Ashmore as protagonist Jack Joyce in 2016's Quantum Break. \nAshmore will play a character named Tim Breaker. Who is Breaker? He’s a sheriff, but that’s all we know for now. However, the fact that he shares a name and occupation with Bright Falls sheriff Sarah Breaker from the first Alan Wake seems more than coincidental. In a video message posted to Twitter by Alan Wake 2 creative director Sam Lake, Ashmore expressed his excitement to work with Remedy again and to play the sequel as an Alan Wake fan himself. \nThe brilliant actor and our good friend, the legendary @ShawnRAshmore plays Tim Breaker in ALAN WAKE 2. We have wanted to work together again ever since Quantum Break. Now it’s happening!! So good to have you in this, Shawn! 🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️🕺🕺🕺 @alanwake @remedygames pic.twitter.com/LQ9lnjA0gx\nAugust 25, 2023\n“I’m very excited to be part of the game with my friends at Remedy Entertainment,\" says Ashmore in the video. \"Our last adventure was Quantum Break, and me personally, I’ve been waiting to play Alan Wake 2 ever since I finished the first game I don’t know how many years ago. I’m sure there’s a lot of people out there that are as excited as I am. So please stay tuned. We’ll release more details about my character, Tim Breaker, and I hope you enjoy playing it. I know I will.\"\nAlan Wake 2 is set to release on October 27, having recently been pushed back from its previous October 17 date.

The theme of this season is centered around heists, both of the sneaky and guns-blazing kind, and curiously, a vampire at the heart of it all. \nThat vampire is named Kado Thorne and he’s made the battle island his home in Fortnite Chapter 4: Season 4. He’s draining the wealth and treasures around it to fund some new real estate (see: points of interest) around the island: Sanguine Suites, Relentless Retreat, and Eclipsed Estate. \n\nEpic Games says these three locations are strongly defended bases with cameras, laser grids, and guards. And inside, you’ll find Thorne has filled them with …",

Today, Jump Over The Age and publisher Fellow Traveller revealed the sequel will launch on Xbox Series X/S and hit Xbox Game Pass on day one. \nThe game will also be available on PC and through cloud gaming via Game Pass. Jump Over The Age also released the first-ever look at in-game footage of Citizen Sleeper 2, showcasing a new location called Hexport. Check it out below: \n\n\n“Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector will take players to a new location and once again put them in the body of a Sleeper, an escaped corporate-owned android trying to build a new life for themselves,” a press release reads. “This time, however, players will have a ramshackle ship and a crew they’ve recruited, both of which they will need to steer through a system-wide crisis.” \nThis sequel will feature the same dice-based tabletop RPG mechanics of the first Citizen Sleeper, with new systems and mechanics “that will provide more depth, complexity, and challenge.” \n\nIf you want more Citizen Sleeper right now, you can check out the Helion Dispatches, text-based narrative transmissions from the Pilgrim Seed, a refugee ship. These dispatches expand on the series’ lore, set up the narrative of the upcoming sequel, and bridge the gap between the first and second games. These dispatches are released every month and will continue to be through mid-2024. \nThere’s no release date for Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector yet. \nIn the meantime, watch the Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector announcement trailer and then read why Citizen Sleeper was one of our favorite games of last year.\nAre you excited for Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector?

First revealed during Summer Game Fest, the game stars a nameless protagonist and his cuddly, water-like pet as they set out to scale a great mountain. The game mimics realistic climbing and physics, and players control each character's arms to pull themselves up and over ever-changing surfaces and obstacles while thoughtfully using a rope to extend their reach. Along the way, you'll explore the ruins of a lost civilization that once called the mountain its home. What happened to these people? What awaits at the summit for our hero? Jusant invites you to strap on your climbing gear and find out.\nJoin editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they explore a slice of Jusant's early chapters and provide a hands-on impression of this enigmatic adventure. Jusant is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass), and PC on October 31. \n\n\nFor more previews and discussions of some of the biggest games of 2023 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Vampire Survivors on Switch, Gunbrella, Mr. Run and Jump,  The Crew Motorfest, Ra Ra Boom, Mortal Kombat 1, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, and Sea of Stars.",

The upcoming brawler based on the popular comic series kicks off Halloween month with its arrival on October 4.\nThe game was first revealed during last year’s Game Awards and features an original story by Hellboy creator Mike Mignola. The late Lance Reddick voices the titular half-demon. Web of Wyrd evokes its paperback origins with an art direction that faithfully replicates the look of the original comics. Players travel to The Wyrd, a brutal world teeming with supernatural threats, in an investigation to locate a missing member of the B.P.R.D.. The journey takes Hellboy and his allies to the Butterfly House, a location with a mysterious and likely sinister legacy. \nWeb of Wyrd is a pure brawler, with players using Hellboy’s powerful fists to pummel foes while dodging and parrying incoming attacks. His gun, on the other hand, helps keep distant foes at bay. Developer Upstream Arcade also states that the game has roguelike elements. \n\n\nIf that sounds up your alley, you can pick up Hellboy: Web of Wyrd on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",

The low-stakes exploration, vibrant environments, and charming cast of characters all made for a cute, low-stress adventure that we couldn't help but enjoy (read our review here). Today, developer MegaWobble and publisher Playtonic Friends announced a new content update for its well-liked title to entice players to give it another go.\nThe free update, which arrives today on both versions of the game, adds new content as well as additional languages. If you've beaten the game (which doesn't take long), you can now access New Game Plus. This lets you carry your upgrades from you completed save file directly into the new game, giving you more exploration and customization options right off the bat. It also adds Baby Mode, which allows you to play the entire game as the baby version of Gator.
