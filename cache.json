Yes, there was Princess Toadstool's Castle Run on Nelsonic Game Watch back in 1990, Princess Peach's very first leading role (which you probably don't need to rush out and buy), and Super Princess Peach on DS, but nothing that feels like a proper turn as the core of a full-on adventure. Until now, that is.\nYep, whilst we were fully expecting this to be a throwaway sort of experience given the above track record, it turns out Princess Peach: Showtime! is easily Ms. Toadstool's finest hour (shocker), and a far more engaging romp than we had prepared for. It's still 100% a game aimed squarely at children, mind, and there's really not a whole ton of challenge for those seeking it, but for younger gamers, for relatives or friends sitting down to have a good old Nintendo sesh with some smaller kids, there's a whole lot of fun to be had with this one.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Utilising a roguelike structure in which you can gain upgrades by purchasing various beverages, you'll be gunning down foes left and right with gameplay that isn't too dissimilar from Hotline Miami itself.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Hellish.\nPeople play games for a variety of reasons. It could be that you want to experience a few thrills, get lost in a world beyond your imagination, or simply relax and wind down after the stresses of day-to-day life. Some games, however, are designed to test the very limits of your patience, inducing a level of anxiety that many would rather avoid at all costs. If you’re someone who thrives on tension and welcomes relentless challenges like a warm hug, then Krimson might just be the game for you.\nEverything about developer CryingPsycho's platformer, from its visual design to its audio, has been designed to be a total assault on the senses, and for good reason. It takes place in a rather abstract depiction of hell, and your job is to simply make it through each level in one piece. We say “simply”, but nothing about Krimson is particularly simple. It’s an exceptionally tough game that, like Super Meat Boy and Celeste, utilises death as a means to educate the player on how to overcome its myriad challenges.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Claymation-me-do Harold Halibut is one of those puzzle-y adventure games that instantly catches your eye when you see it in screenshots and trailers. I mean, who wouldn't be intrigued by its beautiful handmade models and sets? They all have such a lovely texture to them, and the slightly ramshackle way they fit together gives the game a firm sense of place. But after playing an early preview build of Harold Halibut this week, I've been disappointed by just how frustrating it is to actually play. It's not that it's difficult. In fact, the tasks Harold's assigned in the opening few hours of the game are almost insultingly easy, extending to little more than 'feed the fish' and 'talk to so and so', all of which can usually be accomplished by interacting with a single button prompt to move the story along.\nRather, it's Harold himself that makes everything feel like such a chore. He's a bit of a dolt, you see, and everyone around him knows it, treating him with such weary and open disdain like he's some kind of village idiot that I, too, quickly came to dislike him. Harold doesn't help himself much either on this front, weathering everyone's underlying frustration with him like it's all water off a duck's back. It doesn't seem to faze him in the slightest, perhaps because he's too oblivious to even notice. But while this doziness might wash in a book or TV show, taking control of such a character in a game isn't nearly as pleasant. After all, it's not just Harold that's being treated like an ignoramus. By extension, you, the player, are as well, which isn't just immersion-breaking and frustrating, but it's also insulting to your own intelligence. And that, my friends, does not equal happy adventure game fun times.\nRead more",

Oh, you're going to make your dice so much better! Now Slice & Dice has finally arrived on Steam in search of a wider audience, accompanied by an update adding oodles of new heroes, enemies, items, and more. For newcomers, hey, it has a demo.\nRead more",

          "description": "It's been a while, but I'm finally back on the Nancy Drew mystery game train. Choo choo, next stop: San Francisco! This has pleasing synergy with my real life, because I'm currently watching through Monk, a popular detective show also set in San Francisco. Mr. Monk would be displeased by the house Nancy finds herself in this time, which is a mansion being converted into a B&B. The owner, Rose, is working on a shoestring budget and has decided that the best player to add to her renovation team is a young-adult woman who's a friend of a friend. It all makes sense! \nNancy Drew: Message In A Haunted Mansion is the third game in the Nancy Drew mystery series of puzzle games, and boy does the weird first-person fixed camera work against you here. It's also a more disappointing plot than the previous games, but it adds in a new time system that, much like Stay Tuned For Danger, is an ambitious move - and in this case I think it sort of works. It's a mixed bag, is what I'm saying.\nRead more",

That menacing moon is the first hint of Bloodborne, obviously. The second is the lamp-lit, locked-up house to one side, whose unseen occupant tells you to get lost, adding that they don’t believe all this crazy talk about the apocalypse. \r\n\n\r\nI thought at once of the wealthier residents of Yharnam, feasting and laughing hysterically behind the shutters of their fancy townhouses on the night of the Hunt. There are no pitchfork-wielding mobs or werewolves stalking the vicinity, however.

I’m especially attached to my Arisen’s current pair of Pawns, one of whom speaks with the wonderfully stretched intonations of a pitch-shifted Matt Berry. Sadly, none of its achievements pertain to technical fidelity. While decent-looking, Dragon’s Dogma 2 takes some serious hardware to maintain consistently smooth performance, with lowered quality settings lending only the most limp-wristed of helping hands.\nDLSS and FSR 3 upscaling are more effective, but this is one game where powering through the worst of its stuttering and framerate drops will take more than a musclebound graphics card. Not for the first time with an RE Engine game, Dragon’s Dogma 2 appears severely CPU-limited, so it really does demand a fully-upgraded rig to ward off sluggishness – especially at higher resolutions.\nImproving performance isn’t a completely hopeless endeavour, but besides the FPS wobbles, there are some settings oddities that need navigating as well. I’ll cover all that and more in this guide; even if we can’t fix Dragon’s Dogma 2 ourselves, at least we can better understand its strangeness.\n Read more",

In fact, DD2's closeness to the original makes it just as much of a joy as the first, where your grand adventure isn't only grander, it's still at the whims of a world governed by chaotic physics and the passage of time. Quirks remain, for good and bad, but ultimately this is an RPG where you make travel plans and the game does it best to dash them. It never gets old.\nRead more",

          "description": "It's deeply frustrating and disappointing when games get pulled from store shelves due to licenses expiring, and too few ever return. So it's great news that almost four years after Sega stopped selling Obsidian's fascinating spy thriller RPG Alpha Protocol on Steam due to music rights expiring, it has returned to sale on GOG. I'm always surprised that Alpha Protocol hasn't reached serious cult classic status because, as much as parts are distinctly wonky, the globetrotting sneak-o-shooter fizzes with ideas for intense dialogue, branching plot, and reputation systems with consequences. You do feel like a spy going up against the world, backed up only by shifty allies and a ridiculous pair of giant sunglasses.\nRead more",

Perhaps that game exists deeper within Hyper Light Breaker, but during my 20 minutes with the game at GDC, I found myself stopping and starting and struggling to build momentum using a combat system that felt both deliberately challenging and stilted. \nRead more",

Veterans will find plenty of callbacks and familiar names as they poke around its Louisiana manor house – talk of the Pregzt Shipping Company might raise an eyebrow, for instance, as may the gnarled tree filling much of the conservatory. But like these, everything here is remixed, rewritten, relocated. Indeed, Decerto house is no longer empty but a ‘home for the mentally fatigued’, while player characters Carnby and Emily Hartwood now arrive together, since she’s hired him to help check on her uncle, a long-term resident who may be in danger.\nRead more",

The 38-second long reveal trailer paints quite an enticing picture ahead of its Steam launch on March 29th, and that's not even the half of it either. For Valiant Tactics EX isn't just an anime Total War-like. It's also a whopping great deckbuilding game. \nRead more",

But Andrew Gower and developers Fen Research insist that Brighter Shores will balance its nostalgic feel with a fresh approach to the well-worn genre that Gower himself helped wear in over two decades ago.\nRead more",

          "description": "Combat is such a routine activity in video games that it often doesn't feel much like conflict at all. It's just something done to move the simulation along - a propulsive chore stripped of drama or significance or lasting emotion beyond a vague desire to see what lies beyond whatever it is you're trying to kill. In Death Of A Wish, combat has substance: it's a form of redemptive self-expression. The game's fights are a means of asserting and cherishing yourself in the face of a world that regards you as a deviant, a world whose poison you carry on the inside. \r\n\n \nRead more",

It's one of those rereleases that exists mostly for modern consoles, made a bit useless on PC by the fact that you can still buy and fully play the originals for half the price. It's made even less useful by launching in a right wonky technical state, with bad lag, crashes, and reportedly only three 64-player servers online at first.\nRead more",

On a bad day, there are weeds spontaneously spawning from the sky and I need to catch them before they land right on top of my precious plants. Either way, when I’m done, I’ll put the day’s harvest into the processing machines to work while I’m away, and then go exploring for minerals.\nMy goals are clear. I need to build a new machine, or upgrade my mech so that I can clean up a new area of the map and get new resources in return. Those will – you guessed it – let me build new machines or upgrade my mech again. There might be a few steps to juggle on the way, but nothing that needs me to hold long recipe flowcharts in my head. When I get back I’ll have everything I need to take the next step. It always feels like I’m making forward progress.\nRead more",

          "description": "Crow Country and its spooky, mutant-stuffed theme park will be opening its gates on Steam on May 9th, developers SFB Games have announced. It's the first of two games from the Tangle Tower micro-studio coming to PC this year, the other one being The Mermaid's Tongue, which will be picking up the adventures of their Tangle Tower detective duo on a marginally less spooky-looking submarine later this year. Crow Country, however, is a very different kettle of fish, combining chunky, PS1-style Final Fantasy 7 character models with early Resident Evil tank controls and panicked monster shooting.   \nRead more",

          "description": "Cast your eye over the original Outcast from 1999 today, and you'll find a world that's more abstract than alien. Hazy, almost block colour textures are stretched to breaking point over terrain that looks like it's been pulled and poked by a child sculpting in putty slime, while its cast of beige, three-fingered Talans are so rigid that they'd all be reigning champions at the local robot dance-off. Understandable, given the era in which is was made, but even so - what a difference 25 years make. Even after 2017's remake glow-up with Outcast: Second Contact, A New Beginning's version of Adelpha is a lush and verdant paradise, with treetops soaring over your head, and mountains requiring several triple or quadruple jetpack jumps to traverse. It's no Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora, admittedly, but it leans in very much the same direction, punching your eyeballs with such bright, primary colours that you'll feel enticed to explore every inch of it.\nA shame, then, that all its visual splendour amounts to is little more than an empty husk filled with open world busy work that already felt tired and done ten years ago. Its non-linear approach to storytelling remains intact, letting you tackle the quests and problems of its numerous village settlements in any order you wish, but even this has been boiled down to tedious checklists of fetch quests, escort missions and shooting up the same identikit facility one after another. Topping off this fatal combo is returning protagonist Cutter Slade, whose macho army dude dial is still set firmly to cringey wise-cracking and patronising stereotypes. A new beginning this ain't.\nRead more",

No chaser...\" while sipping from a glass of amber liquor isn't indulging in some amount of winking and nudging.\nRead more",

You've got sober infiltration games like Thief, which metes out gradations of light and dark with the care of somebody calculating their tax expenses, and stylised affairs such as Mark Of The Ninja, in which stepping into shadow desaturates you and sort of makes your character far too fancy for enemies to notice.\nThere are games such as Splinter Cell, in which hiding in shadows rests on a gentleman's agreement with NPCs not to perceive the big green torches attached to Sam Fisher's head. And then you have games like Ereban: Shadow Legacy, which has just been given a release date - 10th April. In this mystical third-person stealth-platformer, your character can literally disintegrate and travel through shadows as a ripple of dark energy - a transformation that puts me in mind less of Thief than of squid-mode in Nintendo's Splatoon. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Who is Jeff Minter? Unless you’re a long-term fan of his work, you might have asked that upon hearing about Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story, the latest interactive documentary from Digital Eclipse (following on from The Making Of Karateka and Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration). You might have heard Minter’s name in connection with the remake of the unreleased Atari arcade game Akka Arrh in 2023. Maybe you played his mind-warping shooter Polybius in VR. You might remember as far back as the Atari Jaguar and Minter’s phenomenal Tempest 2000, the unexpected highlight of the console’s library. Or perhaps you recall his work from the 8-bit glory days. You could just know him from the daily videos of him feeding his sheep on YouTube.\r\n\n\r\nThe point is that Jeff Minter has been making games for a phenomenally long time – more than 40 years, in fact. And in all that time, he has stayed true to what he believes in. “One of the things we say in the game itself is the idea of him being the last indie developer,” says Chris Kohler, editorial director at Digital Eclipse in California. “The last of the people from the early 80s who very consciously never sold out, never took the money, never looked to expand or do anything other than [be] just Jeff at his computer, making the sorts of video games that he wants to make.”\r\n\n \nRead more",

Just the opening notes of his theme song, One Winged Angel, are enough to get the heart racing. But Sephiroth didn't make a name for himself with Final Fantasy alone. A particular Disney and Square Enix collaboration, Kingdom Hearts, introduced the villain to a new era of fans, and his appearances in that series are just as menacing, if not more so, than his Final Fantasy 7 presence.\n\n\nIf players missed out on Sephiroth's 1997 Final Fantasy 7 debut, it might be hard to discern why fans go gaga over the character.

As we make our way through the weekly updates and new content drops, the end of the season is quickly approaching. Many look forward to the new content that'll come with season 3. Additionally, you'll need to finish the Season 2 battle pass before it's over.\n\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone Season 2 end date\n\n\nAccording to the in-game timer shown while playing Modern Warfare 3, Season 2 will officially end on April 2, 2024. As a result, there are a few weeks remaining for you to complete the battle pass. Depending on the amount of time you have to play the game, it's definitely possible to move through the many seasonal rewards by then. Additionally, there are a number of weekly challenges available from the start of the Season, and a few more to unlock as we enter new weeks.\n\n\nIt's worth completing the weekly challenges if you're interested in the end-of-season rewards. For example, finishing five weekly challenges for every week of Season 2 gets you the Rotten Inferno weapon camo. As you likely already know, progressing through the battle pass (if you purchased it) gets you all the rewards you see contained in it. A number of which are decent character skins and cool weapon blueprints, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone developers have not made any official announcements about season 3 content yet.

The Syrup sells for 1000 Gold, so it’s worth getting if you want to make some money. \n\n\nHow to get the Mystic Tree Seed recipe\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nYou’ll need to fill up your exp bar in order to purchase a Mastery and each Mastery costs 5,000 more exp than the one before it, so if you’re aiming to unlock the Mystic Tree Seed recipe then I’d recommend choosing Foraging as your first Mastery. As well as the Seed recipe, you also get a Treasure Totem recipe and the ability to find Golden treasure boxes, so it’s well worth it.\n\n\nTo increase your exp, simply play the game; everything provides exp, from planting to battling within the Miines, so you’ll soon get enough exp to purchase a Mastery. \n\n\nHow to craft the Mystic Tree Seed\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nTo craft a Mystic Tree Seed, you’ll need some other tree seeds:\n\n\n\n5 Acorn Seeds\n\n\n5 Maple Seeds\n\n\n5 Pine Cones\n\n\n5 Mahogany Seeds\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve combined these Seeds, you can plant your tree and wait for it to mature, then use the Tapper to get that liquid gold. \n\nThe post How to get the Mystic Tree Seed in Stardew Valley appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Stardew Valley 1.6 added four new seed types and vegetables for you to farm, with Summer Squash being the Summer season's variant. However, while you can easily purchase crops like parsnips and potatoes for Pierre's shop, the same can't be said for these four new ones. Here's how to find Summer Squash in Stardew Valley.\n\n\nWhere to find Summer Squash seeds in Stardew Valley\n\n\nYou can find Summer Squash seeds by digging grass and artifact spots during Summer. While regular dig spots have higher odds of dropping artifacts and books, grass tufts frequently drop seeds. You can harvest artifact and grass spots using a hoe to obtain one or two seeds.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nWhile artifact spots appear as worms coming out of the ground, grass spots look like blades of green grass flowing in the wind. They can appear anywhere on the map, including all terrain types, but I've had the best luck spotting them in the Secret Forest. Nonetheless, you can encounter them anywhere, particularly along the paths leading to the mountains and through the bus stop route.\n\n\nAfter obtaining your Summer Squash seeds, you can grow them after tending to the crop for six in-game days. Since it's a Summer crop, you'll have to plant it during this season, or else the plant will die. Unlike crops like Powdermelon, Summer Squash continues to produce after its first harvest, so your best bet is farming for seeds within the first few days of the season to get the most out of your plants. \n\n\nAfter growing your first Summer Squash, you can use the seed maker to gain more seeds. That way, you don't have to return to the forest or mountains to search for more grass spots. Alternatively, you can sell them to make money, stick the squash in a preserves jar, or eat them raw to regain energy.\n\nThe post How to get Summer Squash and Summer Squash Seeds in Stardew Valley 1.6 appeared first on Destructoid.",

It also has its first trailer and a release window.\nFirst announced in 2022, the game stars Captain America and Black Panther Azzuri, who is the grandfather of T’Challa. The trailer shows them pursuing the mutual goal of taking down the Nazis/Hydra, though for their own personal reasons. Hailing from different worlds, neither is particularly fond of the other's methods, which draws them into conflict. The game also stars Gabriel Jones of the Howling Commandos and Wakanda spy leader Nanali. First revealed at GDC, check out its first cinematic trailer below. \n\n\nMarvel 1943 is a linear single-player experience where you’ll occupy the roles of all four characters at various points, providing different perspectives on the narrative and the war. The project is led by Skydance president Amy Hennig, best known as the principle writer of the Uncharted franchise. \nMarvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is coming in 2025, though platforms are currently unknown.

Bandai Namco showed off what's new, what's staying the same, and even revealed more characters joining the roster. \nNaturally, Goku and Vegeta square off to show off Sparking Zero’s combat. The 3D fighter retains the familiar behind-the-back style of its predecessors, but graphically speaking, the flashy ki blasts and transformations look better than ever. \n\n\nThe presentation introduces four new mechanics. First up is Skill Count, a number that rises as you execute moves during the battle and is then spent to trigger special abilities. Revenge Counter lets players retaliate with a big attack in the midst of absorbing damage. Super Perception is a parry-type move that lets players deflect an attack at the last moment (such as Goku smacking away Vegeta’s Galick Gun), but doing this spends Skill Count points. Lastly, Vanishing Assaults are teleport-based attacks designed to close the gap at mid-range to keep the pressure on your opponent.\nDragon Ball Sparking Zero looks to have a massive roster of fighters (many of them variations of Goku and Vegeta), and the following characters are joining the line-up:\nBroly (Super Saiyan Full Power)\nBurter\nDyspo\nHit\nJeice\nKakunsa\nKale (Super Saiyan Berserk)\nMaster Roshi (Max Power)\nNappa\nSuper Trunks\nToppo\n\nDragon Ball Sparking Zero still doesn’t have a release window, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

F1 23 simulates the realism and intensity of Formula 1 racing, Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 is an arcade racer full of child-like wonder, and Open Roads (which will launch on Game Pass) is a quieter, narrative-driven game about a mother and her daughter going on a road trip.

The large 3,745-piece set is set to release on April 1 in LEGO stores and to those in the LEGO Insiders program. Everyone else can roll for initiative on snagging a set on April 4, for the price of $359.99.\nProduced through the popular LEGO Ideas platform, where fans are able to submit their own build concepts that are then refined and produced as official sets, the final set includes a full dungeon and tower, a tavern, and six minifigures (including an Orc Rogue, Gnome Fighter, Elf Wizard, and Dwarf Cleric). Builders also get several iconic D&D monsters, including an owlbear, beholder, displacer beast, and, of course, the red dragon Cinderhowl, who acts as the centerpiece of the set.\n\nInterestingly, LEGO is offering an actual D&D adventure book to LEGO Insiders as a free digital download or as a paperback book that can be purchased with 2,7000 Insider points. That same book will show up on D&D Beyond (Wizards of the Coast’s digital hub for D&D) complete with characters sheets and digital dice. Presumably, the idea is that you could play out the adventure with the included LEGO minifigs and monsters as the miniatures used on the table, which is a pretty slick way for dedicated players to capitalize on the completed build.\nIn addition to the larger set, LEGO also revealed plans for a full line of D&D-themed minifigures, launching in September 2024.\nWill you be checking out this crossover set?

Its creator, solo developer ConcernedApe, has updated it with plenty of free patches over the years, adding multiplayer, new farm types, and more, but when he moved on to work on his next game, Haunted Chocolatier, the Stardew updates came to an end.

Publisher Playstack also revealed a mobile version is in development.\nCreated by solo developer LocalThunk, Balatro is a roguelike tasking players to play poker hands to fulfill score criteria and advance a series of rounds. Along the way, they’ll spend money to augment their deck with new cards with special effects while collecting powerful Jokers that bestow a wide range of passive and trigger abilities.  \nThe game has earned widespread acclaim and popularity since launching on February 20. I awarded it a 9.5 out of 10, writing in my review, “Balatro is an ingenious and entertaining roguelike and one of my favorite games of the year. Playing it has become a near-obsession; everything feels perfectly designed to encourage you to keep trying because that next run could be the run of your life. Even after hours of play, I still can’t overcome Balatro’s biggest challenge: putting it down.”\n\n\nIn a press release announcing the 1 million milestone, LocalThunk writes, \n“I'm so grateful to all the players and people that have made this happen. I still can't grasp the response to this game, and I am overjoyed that so many people have been able to have fun with my silly creation. I'm so fortunate that I can continue working on my passion as a career. Thank you!”\nBalatro is currently available for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. There’s no release window for the impending mobile versions.",

The program launches today in the Steam Beta Client and it replaces the Steam Family Sharing and Steam Family View features. \nSteam Families can have up to six members, and joining gives you access to any sharable games in each member's library. “Sharable games” is an important distinction, as Family Sharing is a feature that any developer can choose to opt out of for any reason at any time. Some games are also ineligible for sharing due to technical reasons. \nNoteworthy games currently eligible for Family Sharing include Helldivers 2, Baldur's Gate 3, Balatro, Cyberpunk 2077, Elden Ring, and Hogwarts Legacy.

These debates are often full of superfluous apples-to-oranges comparisons and, as a result, are unlikely to come up with a definitive answer everyone will be happy with. But that's what makes them so fun. In that spirit, we're taking the month of March to hold our own bracket-style tournament, voted on by readers, to determine the greatest video game of all time.\nThough we here at Game Informer assembled the bracket, even that was heavily influenced by our Reader Vote we held in 2018 to coincide with our 300th issue. Using the results of our 2018 Reader Vote combined with some input from staff, general sentiment in various online communities, and critical reception for more recent games, we assembled a starting bracket of 64 games. From here, we'll hold two rounds of voting per week until we whittle this field down to one ultimate winner.\nWill this result in a definitive selection of the best game ever released? Or will it reveal a coordinated effort from a particular gaming community committed to seeing their favorite game rise through the ranks? Only time will tell. \nWhile this is meant to be a fun experiment to see how the results shake out within the Game Informer readership and community, we hope you'll come back to root for your favorites every Monday and Thursday until we are able to crown our champion in the 2024 Game Gauntlet.

We also get new glimpses of the game's metroidvania exploration, too, by way of a special yo-yo with a light that lures animals forward and more.

It's being developed for both consoles and PC and Gameloft describes it as an \"innovative hybrid of survival, life simulation, and action RPG.\"\nDisney Dreamlight Valley is popular in the life sim genre, mixing fun gameplay, unique customization, and Disney together into a package that players seem to really enjoy. It launched into Early Access back in 2022 before the full release debuted in December. All of this is to say: if you're a fan of Disney Dreamlight Valley and Dungeons & Dragons, there's a new game to keep an eye on. \nCurrently untitled, Gameloft says in its announcement on Instagram that the game is set in the mythical Forgotten Realms, which is also the D&D setting Baldur's Gate 3 takes place in. The game, which will mix survival, life simulation, and action RPG elements into one, will feature \"unique cooperative gameplay,\" the studio says. \n\"Players can expect an adventure where the rich lore of this legendary franchise meets real-time strategy in a unique campaign of resilience, camaraderie, and danger at nearly every turn,\" the announcement reads.\" \nThere's no name for the project and no release window either. Gameloft is currently hiring for the project. \nNews of this D&D game arrives roughly a year after Wizards of the Coast, which owns the D&D IP and is a division within Hasbro, reportedly canceled five unannounced games. The last D&D game released was Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance back in 2021 – read Game Informer's review of it here. \nAre you excited about this game? Let us know in the comments below!",

You can read Game Informer's Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review here to find out why we love it so much. Now, Ubisoft is giving players another reason to jump back in with a new post-launch content roadmap. \nWhat's more, all of the new content coming to the game is set to release throughout the year, starting with new Speedrun and Permadeath modes this month as well as new outfits for Sargon. In spring, a Boss Rush will be released alongside even more outfits for Sargon, and in summer, the Divine Trials update brings new combat, platform, and puzzle challenges as well as new amulets, outfits, and more. All of this will be free, too. \nHowever, later in 2024, new paid story DLC will hit Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, although Ubisoft offers no teases about what to expect. \nIt's an exciting roadmap, doubly so considering the majority of the new content is free. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review, and then check out our breakdown of the four ways Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown gets the metroidvania genre right.

Coincidentally, that patch was centered on Terminids and nerfing spawn rates for Bile Titans and Chargers on the harder difficulties of Helldivers 2. Windows Central reports Shriekers only appear when a \"Shrieker Lair\" is one of the side objectives on a planet, noting they look like \"smaller versions of the mushroom-like Spore Towers that perpetually keep a large area around them covered in a thick haze.\" \n\n\nShrieker Lairs, like the Spore Towers and Terminid egg nests can be destroyed up close and from afar with a well-placed rocket, grenade, or strategem. \nKeep your eyes on the skies, Helldivers and remember...DEMOCRACY.\nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Helldivers 2 review, and then read about a recent patch that introduced meteor showers and fire tornadoes to the game.

          "description": "PlayStation is rolling out a new update for the PlayStation 5 that enhances audio on the DualSense controller, adds new Share Screen features, and more. This update was in beta last month but rolls out for everyone starting today. \nThe biggest features are coming to the PS5's DualSense controller. The built-in speakers can now produce higher volume sound, which PlayStation says will allow players to hear in-game sounds and voice chat audio more clearly. Plus, the noise cancellation on the controller's built-in mic has been improved. \n\n\n\"The mic input quality on these controllers has been improved, courtesy of a new A.I. machine learning model,\" a PlayStation Blog post reads. \"Background noise from button presses and game audio are suppressed, resulting in a better voice chat experience.\"\nShare Screen is also getting some new features with today's update. Namely, viewers can move a pointer around and send a ping or draw a line on a shared screen, allowing them to highlight objects in-game or guide a player. Plus, viewers can now send emoji-based reactions to the host's screen – these features are turned off by default and the host and viewer must turn them on. PlayStation says these Share Screen features will hit the PS App, which also allows Share Screen, later this month. \nFinally, today's update allows users to adjust the brightness of the PS5 power indicator. Simply go to Settings, then Beep and Light, and then Brightness. \n\n\nFor more, read about the last big PS5 update that added Dolby Atmos, larger SSD capacity, and more to the console, and then check out this story about a retailer listing of a \"V2 DualSense\" with a 12-hour battery life.

          "description": "If you ask any Final Fantasy fan what their top five favorite songs in the franchise are, there's a 99 percent chance one of them is \"To Zanarkand\" from Final Fantasy X. However, it turns out, it wasn't originally intended for the game. \nThis news comes from Audrey (aitaikimochi on X, formerly Twitter), a mega Final Fantasy fan, Twitch streamer, and CEO of Aitai Japan Inc., who translated a recent interview between Weekly Ochiai and Final Fantasy X composer Nobuo Uematsu, whose credits also include One-Winged Angel and Aerith's Theme from Final Fantasy VII and so much more. In that interview, Uematsu revealed \"To Zanarkand\" originally began as a piece for a French flute player, meant to be played during a recital. \n\n\n\"'To Zanarkand' was actually not meant to be the theme for Final Fantasy X,\" Uematsu tells Weekly Ochiai, as translated by Audrey on X. \"There was a flute player from France who originally asked me to write a song for them to play during a recital. When I wrote the piece, I thought perhaps this sounded a bit too sad for a recital. So I set it aside for the time being. \n\"Sometime after, when I was making the score of Final Fantasy X, I was falling behind all the while the producers were hounding me. So since that flute piece was unused, I just kind of meekly handed it to them. They listened to it and said, 'Yes! This is brilliant!'\" \nIn retrospect, it's wild \"To Zanarkand\" wasn't originally composed by Uematsu for Final Fantasy X because it fits the game's themes so well, nailing the somber and sad tone present throughout Tidus and Yuna's journey in Spira. \nFor more about Final Fantasy music, read Game Informer's exclusive four-part series on composer Masayoshi Soken's score for last year's Final Fantasy XVI:\nPart 1: Creating The Prelude\nPart 2: The Victory Fanfare\nPart 3: Finding A Main Theme\nPart 4: The Sound\nAfter that, read Game Informer's review of Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster. \nWhat's your favorite Final Fantasy theme song?

This news comes from a recent notice to investors that explains board member Juergen Goeldner is taking over as interim CEO in the meantime, as reported by GameDeveloper. \nWhile Starbreeze's messaging around Sjögren's leave isn't super clear – the team simply says it is bidding farewell to the former CEO – today's news arrives after Payday 3 failed to meet expectations, according to GameDeveloper. \n\n\n\"On behalf of the board of directors, I would like to thank Tobias Sjögren for his achievements during the past three years,\" board chairman Torgny Hellström writes in the notice to investors. \"Tobias took over the helm of Starbreeze in a challenging phase of its journey and we wish him well in his future endeavors.\"\nGoeldner, the new interim CEO, adds, \"Starbreeze has a strong history of developing and publishing games globally. After launching Payday 3, the company is well-positioned to leverage the strengths of the organization to monetize and develop the IP portfolio. I am looking forward to assuming an operative position and, together with the management, ensure the execution of this strategy.\"\nGoeldner has 40 years of experience in the games industry, including several executive positions, according to the notice. His last executive position was as CEO of Focus Home Interactive. He has been a member of Starbreeze's board of directors since last year. Starbreeze has initiated a recruitment process for a permanent CEO. \n\n\nPayday 3 hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on September 21. We enjoyed the game around launch, giving it an 8 out of 10 in the Game Informer Payday 3 review.

In the most recent two years this has included both students and non-students as eligible candidates for participation.\nLike last year, participants can apply for working on either short tasks (about 175 hours of work), or large tasks (about 350 hours of work). The coding period typically runs from start of June through August, but there is some flexibility which allows participants to have longer time frames if they are unable to work full time through the summer.\nScummVM is looking for people interested in participating in GSoC with us. A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we are also open to your own ideas as well. Please provide the required information in your application before submitting.\nWe also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server, in the #scummvm-gsoc channel. This allows you to engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, to get advice about how to get involved with the project, as well as writing your application.\nBased on our previous 16 years of experience with GSoC, we have put together a Google Summer of Code miniportal to help you get started.\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\n>",

In this post, you’ll get a peek behind the quite transparent curtain and learn more on how OpenTTD is developed.",

          "description": "If you don’t know me, I’m Owen Rudge, and have been involved in the online Transport Tycoon community for almost 25 years. Exactly 21 years ago, I received an ICQ message (look it up, kids) out of the blue from a guy named Ludvig Strigeus (nicknamed Ludde). “Hello, you probably don’t know me, but I’ve been working on a project to clone TTD for a while.” he said, more or less. He didn’t want to release this to the public yet, and wasn’t entirely sure what he was going to do with it. (He’d been working on it since 30th June 2002, so I guess that is technically the birthday of what would become OpenTTD…) Ludde sent me a copy of what he’d been working on, and it was very exciting indeed. It was a fully functional version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, written in C. Admittedly incomplete at that time, it was still quite remarkable.",
