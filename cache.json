          "description": "Level-5 is back!\nIn late 2020, Level-5 shuttered its operations in the West and effectively ended its business outside of Japan, leaving Western fans of franchises such as Yo-Kai Watch and Professor Layton wondering if they would ever see English versions of new entries in their favorite series. Fortunately, the company has since reinvigorated its efforts in the West and one of the new projects to emerge is Megaton Musashi W: Wired. As an enhanced re-release of a previously Japan-only action RPG, this mech battler brings a lot of style, charm, and raw action to the table, marking a strong return to form for Level-5.\nMegaton Musashi W begins by introducing us to Yamato Ichidaiji, a lonely and headstrong teen haunted by unfocused memories of a house fire that apparently killed his little sister. Yamato has a penchant for picking fights with other kids in the quiet suburban streets of Akagicho, often landing him in hot water with the law, and he’s soon offered a way out of his legal troubles when he’s approached by some mysterious agents who see great potential in his fighting capabilities. Yamato begrudgingly accepts their offer to join their “Oblivion Bay” program, only to quickly learn the awful truth that he’s been unknowingly living his whole life in a fortified shelter on a devastated Earth, which was ravaged when aliens called Draktors invaded and killed nearly the entire human population. The aliens are hellbent on finishing the job, but they’re held at bay by the fists and firepower of mighty piloted mech robots called Rogues, one of which is granted to Yamato to continue the fight.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

I'd flown the family nest before I braved the Eagle's Tower. Can you imagine what my friends would have done if I'd owned a Game Boy Camera? Probably, they'd have taken photos of... bottoms with it, and such. \nI'm aware I'm not making a great case for being a graduate of the School of Hard Knocks. The point is: I didn't have a Game Boy Camera then, so I'm delighted that the Game Boy Camera has caught on among a later generation of indie PC developers - prominent among them artist and educator Catharine Graffam, whose GB Camera Gallery: Mystery Show you can play for free in a browser.\n Read more",

Rin D'Lorah, the heroine of new narrative RPG Sky Of Tides, is a bit like the Vitruvian Man, and the result is a game I find at once bewitching and powerfully offputting in its refusal to satisfy the conventions of the genre. \r\n\n \nRead more",

The answer, apparently, is: pretty good, because Styczeń has a healthy approach to early access development in keeping players close, without quite handing them the wheel.\r\n \nRead more",

Me too! Must have been the direct influence for Sea Of Thieves' new Season 12, which launched earlier this week with a bang - from two smoking barrels! Among the additions in this season of the ever popular salty sea-dog open-world adventure are double barrel pistols. They deal less damage per shot but have higher rate of fire, and you can charge them up to fire both barrels at once. \nOn the other end of the weapon scale are new throwing knives, capable of sneak attacks, light slashes, or, you know, throwing. You can nab any throwing knives you see lying around, too, which is fun. But honestly, the Bone Caller tool (the aforementioned jar of skeletons, which has a great Jason and The Argonauts vibe) and the Horn Of Fair Winds are are probably more useful. The winds from said horn can make your ship go faster, but can also put out fires or crowd control enemies, or for some reason make you swim faster? I don't think that makes sense, to be honest, but the horn has limited uses so as not to make you an unstoppable wind machine. \nRead more",

As part of that, they're reportedly now doing away with 70 positions at their Seattle offices - Seattle being the home of the Take-Two-owned Intercept Games, the current developers of space sim Kerbal Space Program 2.\n Read more",

Justin used a large language model to answer questions about the Catholic church and Catholic orthodoxy, and if you have any familiarity with how people love to test AI chatbots - or you read the headline of this article - then you know where this is going. Fr. Justin, who was already kind of controversial anyway, offered the sacrament and claimed to be a real priest to Futurism, and gave the thumbs up to baptising a baby in Gatorade in an emergency.\nCatholic Answers (who have the domain Catholic.com; gotta imagine His Holiness wishes he'd moved quicker on that one) then defrocked Justin, making him  a lay theologian in a suit jacket, jeans and an open collar shirt that gives him a \"me and my wife saw you across the bar\" kind of vibe, when before he had the whole dog collar kit and caboodle.\nRead more",

          "description": "Harold Halibut has the vibes of a game that should be 4-6 hours long and is, inexplicably, 10-12. It's inexplicable not only because it's a slow game low on interaction - the game is really just a plot delivery mechanism; a TV show you can walk around where you advance the story by pressing A - but also because it's a game created using handmade miniatures. It's a sci-fi animated dolls house under the sea, self described as \"a cross between a game and a stop motion film\", and if my game required that amount of labour I'd edit that script down. Then again, there aren't that many locations, so maybe you'd really want to show them off.\nI love miniatures, and Harold Halibut is beautiful. It's also a lovely story about finding yourself and your place in the world, even if that place is unexpected, and having the courage to take that step. There are unexpected silly bits and strange bits and bits where people break into song, and bits where you read undelivered letters. But, at the same time, I totally understand why some people would find it boring.\nRead more",

This will be the studio's next original game, after they wrapped up Layers Of Fear last year with, confusingly, Layers Of Fear (the natural progression for a series: Layers Of Fear, Layers Of Fear 2, and then Layers Of Fear again, although it was going to be called Layers Of Fears at one point).\nBloober Team are currently doing a lot of IP work for other people, with the Silent Hill 2 remake due out later this year, and a game codenamed \"Project R\" in concert with Skybound Entertainment. Skybound are The Walking Dead company, so I wouldn't give you long odds for a bet on what Project R is about. Neither would I be surprised if Project C is unveiled this summer by a man named Geoff with shiny shiny trainers. I'm interested to see what it is, and honestly I'm hoping it's a brand new standalone thing, rather than a forced sequel to Observer or 2021's The Medium (where I got the header). \nRead more",

And yes, we’re only hearing about this a mere month after the last big Amazon discount splurge, Spring Deal Days. My life is a calendar where every square has \"deals\" written on it in increasingly scratchy Biro.\nStill, let’s keep it summery, eh? Prime Day 2024 may not be a surprise (and is still lacking a specific launch date), but unless the US government announces a second June-based Black Friday or something, it likely represents the next mass serving of PC gaming deals for you to take advantage of. SSDs, graphics cards, or anything else that’s been unusually pricey lately are all but guaranteed to get slashed back down, so there are definitely worse times to be in the market for an upgrade than Prime Day.\nRead more",

It was Steam's most wishlisted game before launch, and it's so popular right now that Steam's servers are struggling to keep up: there's an official developer post on the game's Steam forum warning that \"the store is overwhelmed from all the people buying, it may take a couple tries for a bit while things calm down\".\n Read more",

A helicopter will soon join the fray. Many things will soon explode, and you will take a short break from the minigunning to calmly physics some boxes into a set of steps with a crane. This FPS is not so much writing a love letter to a bygone era of noughties shooters, as it is standing underneath the window of its respected elders earnestly serenading them with a busted old keytar from the attic. There are bum notes and the singing voice is not exactly boy-band beautiful, but the love is unmistakably there. And, hey, singing is hard.\nRead more",

          "description": "Lethal Company is a fun game but I know what you're thinking: it lacks feline energy. Whilst the simplistic game loop of collecting scrap on monster-infested moons and selling it to an equally monstrous company is enjoyable at first, it can get old pretty fast. As both Alice and James have attested with their experiences of this month's RPS Game Club pick, Lethal Company is a game that lacks a certain direction the more you play. I soon found myself settling into an existential crisis, reminiscent of my tumultuous stint in retail. A recurring thought back then was why bother stacking shelves, only to have someone buy the products and make me re-stack them again?\nIn the vain hopes of gaining a higher purpose in Lethal Company, I stumbled across the 'Needy Cats' mod. Essentially this mod adds a variety of cats to your game that will wander around the facilities and yelp for attention.\nPerhaps I'm just a glutton for heartbreak, but I decided that the game needed a galactic sanctuary full of adorable balls of floof. I hearkened back to my time playing Stray, the adorable cat adventure set in a post-apocalypse where humanity was all but wiped out. Could this be the prequel to Lethal Company? What if all Apocalypse games share the same universe, all orchestrated by The Company secretly pulling the strings of fate? Or maybe I just wanted to look at cute cats instead of terrifying mannequin monsters. Either way, the cats needed help. What follows is a diary log of my adventures which soon lead to increasing madness and ultimately, disaster.\nRead more",

          "description": "The Final Fantasy XIV Dawntrail benchmark released on April 12, and it hasn’t exactly been the smoothest of rides. While this is to be expected, considering the massive number of graphical changes coming with 7.0, it’s nice to know that XIV producer Naoki Yoshida is working hard to perfect the teaser software.\n\n\nSince the announcement that there were, indeed, issues with the original benchmark, it seems that the development team has been hard at work not only identifying the issues, but also starting to work on fixes. \n\n\nAccording to the most recent update, posted on the Lodestone on May 2, the team are working on not only fixing the issues in preparation for the release of Dawntrail itself, but also to implement them into an updated benchmark. \n\n\nApparently, a lot of the work on the character creation part of the benchmark has already been completed and is in the fine-tuning and refining stage, with Yoshida taking over final inspections. \n\n\nMeanwhile, the work on issues surrounding data and processes is still underway and scheduled to be complete on May 15, with Yoshida doing his final inspections the following day. Due to the amount of things that need to be looked over, this final inspection is expected to take approximately a week to complete. \n\n\nAlthough we don’t know exactly when an updated benchmark will be released, Yoshida has said that we can expect it to drop at some point after May 23. He apologizes for the lack of exact date, something which is heartening to see but, in my opinion, unnecessary considering the effort being put into perfecting such small aspects of the benchmark, going into Dawntrail.\n\n\nWith the next Live Letter from the Producer happening on May 16, it’s possible that we will find out more information regarding these updates during the stream.\n\nThe post Updated Final Fantasy XIV Dawntrail benchmark gets a rough release window appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Once you're at the stage of farming Prime weapons and frames in Warframe, grinding for the supplies you need can get grossly time-consuming. Not only do you need to trust in the RNG of getting Prime parts (unless you purchase them from another player), but you also need to farm up many materials to make said Prime item. \n\n\nNearly every Prime item in the game needs Orokin Cells to be crafted, so farming these as quickly as possible can help a lot. Here's how to farm Orokin Cells in Warframe.\n\n\nWhere to get Orokin Cells in Warframe\n\n\nOrokin Cells are found on Saturn, Ceres, and Deimos as a possible drop from most Grineer or Infested enemies, albeit with a low chance. Orokin Cells can also drop from any boss in the game, though the rate of this can vary. With all this in mind, missions where you kill many enemies or deal with bosses quickly can be a great source of Orokin Cells. A personal favorite farming spot of mine is Piscinas on the planet Saturn, since it offers Infested enemies in droves and has plenty of rooms for you and your squad to sit in.\n\n\nIf farming a boss is more your speed, the easiest way is to farm the Captain Vor and Lieutenant Lech Kril dual boss fight on the node Exta on Ceres. Both Vor and Lech Kril are easy to kill once you understand their mechanics, and no other fight in the game has you fighting two different bosses in the same mission. I tend to average about one Orokin Cell per run doing it this way.\n\n\nHow to speed up Orokin Cell farming\n\n\nIf you're feeling extra desperate, then there are ways to speed things up further. If you're in a full squad, running a Nekros, Nova (with Speedva build), Khora, and Wisp on Piscinas can net you a lot of kills quickly, thus giving more Orokin Cells. If you're running it solo, then you should play either Khora or Nekros. Otherwise, running Steel Path and having a Resource Booster + Drop Chance Booster can give far more Orokin Cells. \n\nThe post How to farm Orokin Cells in Warframe appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Card games have frequently been the foundation of tense stand-offs in anime and manga. Now, a manga based on the drama of Magic: The Gathering, incorporating some school life and romantic tension into the mix, is getting its official debut in the West.\n\n\nViz Media has announced that it's officially releasing Destroy All Humans. They Can't Be Regenerated. A Magic: The Gathering Manga in English this Fall. The title's quite a mouthful, but looking into the synopsis via MyAnimeList, you can get a pretty good picture of what's in store.\n\n\n\n\nSet in 1998, the story follows Hajime Kanou, a high-schooler who loves Magic: The Gathering. He develops a rivalry at school with top student Emi Sawatari, who he later finds out play MTG, and plays it pretty darn well. Per MAL's description, this revelation shifts their relationship, as they get to know each other through Magic duels.\n\n\nNo mulligan\n\n\nI was already intrigued by the idea of a manga based around Magic: The Gathering, but this rivals-to-something-new arc adds an interesting new hook. It'll likely be some captivating nostalgia for those who lived through the late '90s, too. Do you see that phone Emi is holding in the cover art? They just don't make 'em like that anymore.\n\n\nDestroy All Humans has a story penned by Katsura Ise, and art by Takuma Yakota. And for those Magic: The Gathering players who need extra incentive to buy physical, it will include an exclusive card. No word yet on what it will be, though I'm hoping for a suitable art variant.

          "description": "One Piece is already infamous for its incredible length, both in the manga and anime. However, the Dressrosa Arc stands out even among the many story arcs for its impressive length. As such, it is no surprise some fans would want to know which episode marks the end of the Dressrosa Arc in the One Piece anime. \n\n\nImage via Toei Animation\n\n\nOne Piece Dressrosa Arc episodes, explained\n\n\nThe Dressrosa Arc in One Piece lasts from episodes 629-749 in the anime adaptation. That is a whopping 118 episodes in total for a single story arc. Fans looking for the final episode of this particular story arc should look to episode 749 “The Sword Technique Heats Up - Zoro and Law Finally Appear!” That episode marks the end of the Dressrosa Arc and the beginning of the next story arc in the anime, the Silver Mine Arc. \n\n\nFor those fans who prefer to stick to the manga version of the series, you’ll want to look for chapter 801 as the final chapter of the Dressrosa Arc. This arc lasts for a grand total of 102 chapters in the manga series, from chapters 700-801. Unlike the anime adaptation, the filler-free manga goes from the Dressrosa Arc directly into the Zou Arc for its next story section. \n\n\nThe Dressrosa Arc is the second half of the entire Dressrosa Saga, which also encompasses the Punk Hazard Arc. Those looking to check out that arc first should watch out for episodes 579-625 in the anime version. Manga readers will want to look for chapters 654-699. \n\nThe post What episode does the Dressrosa Arc end in One Piece? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The excitement around Fortnite's Star Wars event has hit high gear, but players jumping into the game to get involved are finding themselves locked out after being hit with \"Matchmaking Error #1: You do not have permission to play.\"\n\n\nPlayers who try to get into matches are being told that it \"Looks like all the Battle Buses headed out are full. Give it another shot in a few minutes.\" Unfortunately, even if you leave it for a bit, trying again will see you hit with the same error.\n\n\nI just want to swing a Lightsaber at a LEGO Stormtrooper! Image via Epic Games\n\n\nWhat's causing Fortnite's \"You do not have permission to play\" error?\n\n\nThis frustrating bug seems to be coming from Epic's side, so there doesn't seem to be much that can be done at this point. It appears that the game is having issues with its servers, which are either overcrowded or simply not allowing anyone into matches. \n\n\nIs there anything I can do to fix the error?\n\n\nIt seems unlikely that there's anything we can do on our end to solve this, but if you want to try some things, there are a few options: \n\n\n\nRestart the game: Always the first thing you should try, but some players on X have reported that this is helping. \n\n\nRestart your internet: This seems to be on Epic's side, but if you're desperate you could try to reset your internet on the off-chance it's actually a problem on your end. \n\n\n\nOther than those, the sad answer is you'll just have to wait for Epic to get them back online. \n\n\nHas Epic responded to this Fortnite error?\n\n\nNo, unfortunately, Epic have yet to address the issue, with nothing posted on their Fortnite Status account on X. We'll be sure to update this article if we hear from the developer. \n\n\n\n\nIf you've managed to make it into Fortnite, learn how to get the new Chewbacca skin, or read about the LEGO Fortnite Star Wars Quests. \n\nThe post Fortnite’s Star Wars update is broken as players ‘do not have permission to play’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days.

Ahead of the game's May 21 launch, developer Ninja Theory has revealed the PC specs and system requirements for Senua's Saga: Hellblade II and to play the game at its best, you'll need quite a powerful system. \nIf you're familiar with Ninja Theory's work, you likely already know it pushes the envelope with technology so it might not come as a surprise your PC will need to do the same. But if you're new to this team, or just want to check if you're ready for the game later this month, we've got you covered. \n\n\nSenua's Saga: Hellblade II PC Specs And System Requirements\nBelow is a chart released by Ninja Theory detailing everything you need to know about running Senua's Saga: Hellblade II at its most demanding, recommended specs, and even at the bare minimum.

          "description": "Developer Arrowhead Game Studios and Sony Interactive Entertainment have announced that Helldivers 2 on Steam will soon require a PlayStation Network account to play. All new players from May 30 will have to link their Steam account to a PSN account, and all current players will have to do so by June 4. \nUp until this point, a PSN account was not required to play Helldivers 2 on PC via Steam, and with the sudden switch-up, players have taken to the game's Steam reviews to express their frustration. Admittedly, the game's rating is still \"Very Positive,\" with roughly 80% of user reviews falling into this category, but that 80% is lower than it has been in the weeks prior. And now, if you look at the game's recent reviews, you'll find plenty of negative ratings over the required PSN account change. \nSIE says due to \"technical issues at the launch of Helldivers 2, we allowed the linking requirements for Steam accounts to a PlayStation Network account to be temporarily optional. That grace period will now expire.\" That expiration begins on May 6 for new players and June 4 for current players. \nWhile frustration is understood, it's important to note a PlayStation console is not required to create a PSN account – creating one is free and can be done online, no PlayStation 5 required. SIE encourages players to do so ahead of the June 4 change. \n\"We understand that while this may be an inconvenience to some of you, this step will help us continue to build a community that you are all proud to be a part of,\" the announcement reads. \nFor more, read about the Democratic Detonation premium Warbond that drops into Helldivers 2 this week, and then read about how the latest Helldivers 2 update increased the level cap, added blizzards and sandstorms, and more. Check out Game Informer's Helldivers 2 review to find out why we think it's a must-play game. \nWhat do you think about these changes? Let us know in the comments below!",

The studio’s two founders are the only remaining employees.\nFounders Keon Deetman (CEO) and Paul Deetman (managing director) announced on social media that after the studio failed to secure funding during the Game Developer’s Conference (GDC) in March, it had “exhausted all our possible options for publishing, work for hire, and co-development.” As a result, the remainder of its staff has been let go. GameIndustry.biz confirmed that 13 employees were affected, 11 of which were full-time and 2 freelance contractors. \nThe Deetmans have made a call for any studios with open positions to hire its affected staff. The founders plan to stay in business and have vowed to rebuild, which includes launching a Kickstarter to crowdfund Deliver Us Home,  a sequel to Deliver Us Mars. \nIt was clear Keoken was in trouble when the founders posted a video in March revealing it had been unable to land a publishing deal after spending two years pitching five games to over 40 publishers. Instead, the founders decided to publicly reveal these projects to help garner interest, one of which was Deliver Us Home and two were Deliver Us The Moon spin-offs, including a VR game. \nKeoken once employed 45 employees, but the headcount was reduced to 20 by March 2024 before four more employees were let go that month. In an interview with GameIndustry.biz, the Deetmans revealed they had gone months without collecting a salary to help stay afloat.",

          "description": "Universal Orlando Resort has released a new video detailing what to expect at its Florida-based Super Nintendo World when it opens as a land in its Epic Universe theme park next year. In it, the company confirms the land will have three rides, including the Donkey Kong Mine Cart Madness coaster that's expected to open later this year in Osaka, Japan's Super Nintendo World. \nThe video includes digital fly-overs of the park, showing viewers what it will look like when it opens next year. If you've seen Super Nintendo World in Japan, this park looks nearly identical, with both the Donkey Kong Country (and mine cart coaster) section and the Mushroom Kingdom with Peach's Castle, Mt. Beanpole, the Mario Kart: Bowser's Challenge augmented-reality ride and Yoshi's Adventure dark ride. \nCheck it out for yourself in the new Super Nintendo World overview video below: \n\n\nAs you can see, the Donkey Kong Mine Cart Madness coaster will feature state-of-the-art track technology that allows it to create the illusion that riders will actually jump off the tracks, just like in the Donkey Kong Country games. \nLike in Hollywood's Super Nintendo World, which does not have the Yoshi's Adventure ride or the Donkey Kong expansion as a result of space at the location, and Osaka's Super Nintendo World, guests can purchase Power-Up Bands to play in interactive Key Challenges to earn coins and more. Plus, returning locations like the Toadstool Cafe restaurant and more will be at Orlando's iteration of the park. \nHere's a look at some of the locations to expect when Universal Epic Universe opens next year: \n\nFor more details about the park, read Game Informer's breakdown of everything coming to Epic Universe next year. After that, check out photos from our visit to Japan's Super Nintendo World, and then watch this vlog of our day at the theme park. \nAre you excited for Epic Universe and Orlando's Super Nintendo World?

Batman: Arkham VR felt more like a tech demo than a fully fleshed-out game, but its relatively high sales showed that the appetite was there.

As for why, the company is aiming to be more selective about its projects moving forward. \nThis news comes from a release related to Square Enix's holdings, which explains the company is incurring losses of 22.1 billion Yen, or roughly $140 million, on its financial books for the fiscal year that ended in March. \n\n\n\"At the meeting convened on March 27, 2024, the Board of Directors of Square Enix Holdings voted, in light of the myriad changes underway in the environment surrounding its group, to revise the group's approach to the development of high-definition (HD) games with the intention of being more selective and focused in the allocation of development resources,\" the release reads. \"As a result of a close examination, the company expects to recognize approximately 22.1 billion Yen in content abandonment losses on its books for the fiscal year ended March 2024.\" \nWhile potentially canceled games might sound doom and gloom, it sounds more like Square Enix is sharpening its developmental focus to ensure that the games it releases are hits or, at the very least, financially successful for the company. Nonetheless, it sounds like roughly $140 million of games in development have been canceled and it's unlikely we'll ever find out what they were. \nThis release comes after a big splash from Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, which Square Enix released in February. Elsehwere in 2024, Square Enix is releasing Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail, the new expansion for the MMO that will kick off a new saga for the long-running game, in July. \nWhat's your take on this news?

This news follows yesterday's tease from both Housemarque and later Dark Horse Comics about Returnal, sending fans into an understandable frenzy about what the teams had in store for players. \n\"Another year, another cycle,\" a post on X (formerly Twitter) from Housemarque reads. \"The Third time around, extra loot is exposed with Dark Horse flair.\" \nHere's what that flair brings to the Returnal universe: \nReturnal: Fallen Asteria Graphic Novel\nReturnal Artbook\nFallen Asteria Animated Adaptation\nNow, even with PlayStation dipping its toes into cross-media production with Amazon's God of War series and Netflix's Horizon adaptation, this Returnal adaptation isn't the same. Instead, it's an \"animated version of the first issue of the upcoming graphic novel, Returnal: Fallen Asteria.\" Check it out for yourself below: \n\n\nHousemarque says the 88-page graphic novel will arrive in paperback on bookstore shelves starting October 22, 2024, and it will hit comic book shops the next day. \nIt's unclear if the animated adaptation above is the animated adaptation today's announcement refers to or if it's just the first part of it since it only adapts the first issue of the graphic novel. \nHere's a look at the Returnal: Fallen Asteria issues coming this October: \nThere's no word on when the Returnal artbook will arrive, but presumably it's this year. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Returnal review, and then check out this story about the PC specs required to play Returnal on a desktop or laptop. After that, read about Returnal's Ascension update, which added co-op gameplay and a new challenge tower to the game. \nReturnal hit PlayStation 5 on April 30, 2021.

As for what to expect of Shattered Space, Howard didn't say much. However, we already know it will bring new story content, locations, gear, and more to Starfield. \n\n\nAs noted by XboxEra, Shattered Space will be free for all Starfield Deluxe Edition owners. \nAs for the update coming to Starfield later this week, Howard says it will focus on the ship-building. This lines up with what the Starfield team shared last year in its 2024 plans for the game. Here's what it said at the time: \"For those who love ship building, we'll also be expanding on ship customization with ship decorations, new ship building options, and more.\"\nOther updates scheduled for 2024 include new ways to travel, city maps, mod support, accessibility and additional difficulty options, and more. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Starfield review, and then read about how Starfield is surprisingly great as a remote-play game.

The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass released in 2007 for DS and is controlled entirely by touchscreen. Back in 2017 while speaking with longtime Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma for our Breath of the Wild cover story, he cited Phantom Hourglass as his personal favorite Zelda game saying that his wife is a fan of that entry, and it was the first time he was in the role of producer. \"I have a lot of sentiment for it,\"Aonuma said.\nCheck out the video below for an hour Phantom Hourglass gameplay below.\n\n\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

          "description": "Blizzard has decided to cancel this year’s BlizzCon. The company states the event will return in the future, but it plans to showcase upcoming games in a different manner over the coming months. \nFirst announced in a blog post, Blizzard plans to share details on upcoming games like World of Warcraft: The War Within and Diablo IV’s Vessel of Hatred expansion at other trade shows, such as Gamescom. The company also plans to launch “multiple, global, in-person events” for Warcraft’s 30th anniversary, which are described as being “distinct” from BlizzCon. \n“Our hope is that these experiences – alongside several live-streamed industry events where we’ll keep you up to date with what’s happening in our game universes – will capture the essence of what makes the Blizzard community so special,” Blizzard states in the blog post.\nA Blizzard representative tells Windows Central that Blizzard made the call to cancel BlizzCon and not Microsoft, which completed its acquisition of the company last year. In a statement to the outlet, the representative says, “This is a Blizzard decision. We have explored different event formats in the past, and this isn't the first time we're skipping BlizzCon or trying something new. While we have great things to share in 2024, the timing just doesn’t line up for one single event at the end of the year.”\nBlizzCon began in 2005 as an annual convention celebrating all things Blizzard. Last year's show saw the reveal of World of Warcraft’s next expansion, The War Within, as well as two other expansions coming after it. It's good that event is only taking a year off as opposed to being canned for good, and we're curious to see how the alternative events shape up over the coming months.",

          "description": "Dragon's Dogma 2 launched a little over a month ago and has already managed to sell 2.5 million copies, but Capcom is still releasing updates to patch minor issues with the game. While a large volume of complaints have been about the lack of a performance mode, this update (like the last update) does not address that issue. However, it does aim to clean up a number of irritating errors involving the behavior of pawns, the player's AI companions.\nAn update for Dragon's Dogma 2 is now live on all platforms!\nhttps://t.co/waEdG0ntSv\nApril 25, 2024\nFor starters, this update makes it easier to detect dragonsplague, an affliction that, if untreated, can lead to devastating consequences for your pawns and your world. It's also contagious, so it's a good idea to nip it in the bud as soon as you first encounter it. When afflicted, pawns' eyes will glow red – after this update, they'll glow more noticeably. The update also causes the disease to infect pawns less frequently.\nPawns should also be a lot less annoying now, thanks to a whole slate of minor refinements to their behavior. They'll jump off cliffs less often (which is hilarious but a wild inconvenience), say some lines less often, say other lines at more appropriate times and become less likely to offer to be hired while passing by on the street. They're one of the highlights of the game, so anything done to make their constant presence more consistent is always welcome.\nThere are also smaller adjustments, like adding the ability to zoom in on a character's face in shops, preventing monster attacks in town from leading to the player's arrest, and other miscellaneous bug fixes. You can read the full list of updates, as well as all past updates, here.",

          "description": "Taming a wolf in Minecraft is one of the game's simplest joys, and no matter how many times I start a new world, I always hoard bones in case I encounter one. But once you've adopted a canine companion, you probably hide them away in a house for safe-keeping, shielding them from the horrors of the game's hostile mobs. Today, Minecraft is adding a way to make them a little stronger – wolf armor.\n\n\nLike leather armor, wolf armor can be colored using dyes in-game, so if you've got multiple adopted animals, it'll still be easy to tell them apart. This variation is separate from the collar colors as well, creating plenty of possibilities. Even better, the game is also adding wolf fur variants for the first time, bringing eight new patterns for a total of nine. Each variant (Pale, Woods, Ashen, Black, chestnut, Rusty, Spotted, Striped, and Snowy) spawns in a specific biome. You can take a look at all the new breeds in the gallery below.\n\nOf course, players will need to be able to craft this wolf armor as well, which is where the new mob, the armadillo, comes in. These armored relatives of anteaters can be found in savannah or badland biomes, where they can be seen strolling around and curling into a defensive ball when certain enemies come near. Armadillos drop armadillo scutes, which are used to make the wolf armor, but the developers have reassured players that they can be brushed rather than defeated, so you won't have to go on an armadillo massacre to protect your pets. Armadillos can also be used to scare away spiders since they eat insects and arachnids in real life, and spider eyes can be used to breed them if you want to make your own armadillo farm.\nYou can read the rest of the notes for the 1.20.5 update right here.",

Epic says players who have these emotes hidden with this new setting will see a player using the emote standing still, with no emote sound. \nThis new setting can be found under \"Social Privacy\" in the Fortnite settings and it defaults to only show these confrontational emotes from friends in your party. Epic stresses that this setting does not change a player's ability to use any emotes. It is now live in-game. \nFor more about Fortnite, check out these Avatar: The Last Airbender skins now available in the game, and then read about how Fortnite's next Star Wars crossover will span Lego, Fortnite Festival, and Battle Royale.

Knowing of the Ardognus prophecy, created by the powerful high priest Hahmid III, you must find and destroy the hidden shrine devoted to Ra before the eclipse occurs.\nEmbark on this exciting journey packed with a trusty gun for blasting through doors or dispatching undead mummies; a compass to guide you through a treacherous pyramid; a wristwatch to track the precious time left; and a water bottle to fight dehydration (you’re only human after all). \nCan you solve this ancient mystery within 120 minutes and avert catastrophe, or will Rah's wrath obliterate the moon?\nOur modern reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Total Eclipse support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC. More releases are coming at a later date. Additionally, there are three playable demos if you want to test the game. Please contact us if you have some other release or demo.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build.
