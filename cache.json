It was a sweet tale told in five parts by content creator and Nintendo Life reader Ben Riou-Pollard (@ben.m0v), and now, two years later, he's only gone and done it again.\nFear not, this isn't another story of dog abandonment, but it is one of abandoned Pokémon. You see, while hitting up a local car boot sale earlier this month, another lost game found its way into Ben's path: a battered old copy of Pokémon Emerald. And so, naturally, we're once again buying a ticket to another emotional rollercoaster of a TikTok series.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

But as you question the motives behind this task and mull whether to slay or spare the eponymous princess, the game reveals a surprisingly dense philosophical narrative that probes questions of perspective, autonomy, and existence.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Instead of growing fruits of vegetables, you grow crops of monsters. And all of this is given form by Fairy Tail and Edens Zero creator Hiro Mashima's distinctive artwork.\nIn this new RPG, we follow Ten and his friends who are all Farmagia — magical tamers (or farming mages) that can control and fight with monsters.

It all rides on who you speak to. The humans believe one thing about the origins and workings of Thedas, the elves another, the qunari something else entirely. These differences are the basis for many factional disagreements and thus, many core series plot developments. According to former lead writer David Gaider, however, there's an \"uber-plot\" behind it all that may one day be resolved and bring the series to a close, assuming BioWare continue to refer to his original (and closely guarded) narrative documents.\r\n \nRead more",

Sintopia is the Two Point incarnation of that premise - in other words, brighter and breezier and definitely more slapstick than Christian. It puts you in charge of a world divided between Earth and hell, and challenges you to ensure a steady movement of optimally sinful souls between one and the other.

I think his political stance is abundantly obvious in Indiana Jones And The Great Circle - the new Wolfenslike from MachineGames, in which you will blast and bludgeon literally hundreds of Shitlerites in unambiguously one-sided first-person view. So it's amusing, if not wholly unexpected, that MachineGames and Bethesda have slapped the game with an explicit disclaimer stating that the game's depictions of Nazis are not, in fact, Nazi propaganda.\n Read more",

The world has ended, the oceans teem with squirmy, extra-dimensional lifeforms, and it's your job as the apparent sole surviving lighthouse keeper to distinguish vessels loaded with eldritch horrors from vessels loaded with people who need saving from eldritch horrors. \nGoing by the teaser trailer, below, this appears to be comparable to playing border guard in Papers, Please, but it's less political and more tentacular. You field queries over the radio, run your finger down a clipboard, and decide whether to kindle the lamps or beg the coastguard to blast that ship back to hell. There's a dialogue line in the trailer which I, personally, would consider highly untrustworthy. \"It's consuming my team!\" screams a self-described ship captain. \"Please, send help! Gosh...\" Look, \"friend\", no genuine human being says \"gosh\" in an emergency situation. Not even British human beings say \"gosh\" in an emergency situation. That's what you say when somebody tells you the pizza-flavoured crisps are back on sale at Aldis.\n  \nRead more",

This is their take on a Steam Deck rival, or more specifically, the Steam Deck OLED, as this is the first real competitor to go for a similarly star-bright, colour-erupting AMOLED display. Cor, phwoar, and indeed, wowzers.\nMuch like a Zotac GPU, the Zone is chunkier than you might like but ultimately well-crafted. It successfully combines that rich screen with oodles of input features and Deck-thrashing performance, though between its high price and a downright vampiric thirst for battery juice, it’s definitely more of a specialist tool than a crowd-pleasing portable.\nRead more",

It's got a pleasant upstairs-downstairs vibe. On the one hand, you get to paint toy towns on hexagons, as in a traditional 4X or Civ clone; on the other, you can smash-cut to a banqueting scene and watch a drunken dignitary throw a goblet at your master of horse.

In case you're unfamiliar, Denuvo's wares have become infamous for allegedly sabotaging the performance of all sorts of video games, from Resident Evil: Village to Tekken 7, though accounts of the severity vary, and there is an on-going shortage of independently supplied raw data. \nDenuvo's attempts to clear the air include opening a Discord, which they say “ is a key step in fostering closer relationships with game developers, publishers, and players, offering a dynamic, real-time platform for meaningful interaction”. On Monday, Denuvo’s media team reached out to me to offer an interview with Denuvo’s product manager, Andreas Ullmann. Here’s that interview, edited for brevity. \nRPS: In a recent public statement you said “we will stop letting every claim about our product go unanswered\". What claims are you referring to?\nAndreas Ullmann: It's basically really about the stuff that's posted by the community. So you just need to check out Steam forums, for example. Very toxic, very hostile environment. If a game announces to use any of our products, if you check out the Steam forums, all the claims are popping in. SSDs are destroyed by our solution. The usual performance topics, and we simply don't want to leave the floor to these people who are posting all things about us anymore. We want to also be there for a person who has not heard about us before. We also want to share our view, our opinion on these topics, and also act as a trusted source of information.\nRead more",

Earlier this week, French journalist Gautoz reported that Ubisoft had disbanded The Lost Crown's core dev team after turning down proposals for a sequel and further expansions.

At least, I think he's an odd flag-bearer for a series of games where you live out a nostalgic, Japanese summer in the countryside.\nAnd I think it's doubly weird that Shin chan: Shiro And The Coal Town opts for a collectathon approach, that doesn't necessarily make the act of living out a Cicada Summer all that mesmerising. But, and this is a big but: I can't stop thinking about it. Of all the games of 2024, Coal Town may have left the biggest impression on me. In a way, I hope it does for you, too.\nRead more",

Try to strafe left to dodge an attack from a blubber monster, and you’ll instead rotate on the spot. Attempt to turn the camera with a flick of the mouse, and you’ll discover that your view remains fixed in place - the cursor moving across the screen as if searching for an icon on your desktop.\n\"The controls are actually one of the biggest points that make people bounce off the game,\" developer Raphael Bossniak admits.\nAnd yet they’re also a unique selling point. Where last year’s extraordinary System Shock remake embraced the interface and keyboard conventions of modern gaming, Sonar Shock leans into the experimentation of pre-Quake control schemes - long before WASD and mouselook became standardised for the sake of ease and sanity.\nRead more",

          "description": "Back in the protean stink of 2013, the beast we call Factorio sprouted in lowercase early access form and began its meticulous, ravenous conquest of the emerging factory sim genre. Some say that Factorio gave that genre life, though I'd point at Dwarf Fortress as one among many notable forebears. Today, the terrain of factory simming is hotly contested by rival piles of conveyor belt spaghetti. I'm not just talking about Satisfactory or Shapez - they're even making philosophical factory sims these days. They have cosy factory sims now.\nAccordingly, the immense, smoke-rimmed cyborg eye of Factorio has turned from the exhausted soil to the relatively untapped heavens. Somewhere up there, there is unspoilt territory. Somewhere, there is land that has never known the roar of a smelter - and in Factorio's behemothic Space Age DLC, out today, you will find it.\n Read more",

And over the years it's received a slew of updates that make it a bit bigger and a bit better, but nothing that's been mega substantial. That is, until today's announcement that it's getting an Ode To Castlevania expansion, classed by developers Poncle as the game's biggest DLC yet. More characters, more weapons, a weapon selector, an enormous stage. I simply can't wait to devour more packets of crisps as I play this.\nRead more",

With the steely glare of a polygonal warrior on the verge of killing god, he turns to them and says: \"Let's mosey!\" It's an unintentionally comical moment - an easy-going phrase, as if they're all going to the shops and not jumping into a big glowing pit at the end of the world.\nIt's a result of the RPG's famously rushed translation. But maybe not in the way you think. A fan translation of Final Fantasy VII has now fixed a bunch of mistakes that were present in the original, and \"let's mosey\" is one of them. The fix? Have Cloud say it way more often.\nRead more",

In my efforts to achieve the absolute tranquility needed to spend five days shovelling PC game news stories into a ravenous otherworldly monster, I often go for an early morning walk.

Anyway, while walking this morning I think I actually scared somebody into crossing the road. It turns out roaming around at sunrise near Halloween looking like a ringwraith is a great way to become a figure of menace. Sorry, neighbour!

          "description": "Konference OpenAlt 2024 proběhne již tento víkend 2. a 3. listopadu v prostorách FIT VUT v Brně. Začíná ale už v pátek na warm-up party ve Studentském klubu u Kachničky v 17:00. Pokud jste ještě areál FITu nenavštívili, k dispozici jsou pokyny k orientaci. \r\n\r\nNa programu je 54 přednášek a workshopů. Témata jsou od silně technických témat jako je třeba GCC nebo PostgreSQL po méně technické témata jako eGovernment, nebo třeba detailní analýzu problémů s Digitálním Stavebním Řízením. Vypíchnout lze přednášky linuxových distribucích Fedora Silverblue (Nerozbitný linux pro celou rodinu), openSUSE Leap, nebo Turris. Nesmí chybět témata jako kontejnery (Kubernetes) nebo umělá inteligence (velké jazykové modely). Už tradičně si můžete zkusit nakreslit mapu OpenStreetMap se zkušenými lektory od Missing Maps. Pro bastlíře je nachystaná například přednáška o chytré domácnosti Majordomus nebo o Linuxu v ledničce. S cílem přitáhnout mladší generaci představujeme studentskou sekci, kde jsou jednotlivé projekty dílem studentů (například v rámci jejich maturitních prací). Bude řeč i o výuce programování na základní škole, nebo výuce fyziky pomocí arduina \"Physibox\".\r\n\r\nMimo hlavní program bude na chodbách spoustu stánků různých projektů jako je Fedora, openSUSE, Grafana. Stánek budou mít i radio amatéři a 3D tiskaři. Pro děti bude v sobotu nachystaný dětský koutek, kde si děti budou moci vyzkoušet různé hračky pro výuku programování. V neděli se dětský koutek promění v PlayZone od OMG Robotics. Sobotní odpoledne tradičně zakončíme posezením u lahodného moku ve studentském klubu u Kachničky.\r\n\r\nBudeme rádi, když myšlenky naší konference budete šířit a pozvete své kolegy a kamarády. Jak jistě víte, tak konference je primárně v češtině a vstup je zdarma.\r\n\r\nPokud máte nějaké otázky, tak se zkuste podívat do FAQ nebo se zeptejte na Matrixu, Telegramu nebo emailem.",

That's interesting for looking at the new 5th Gen AMD EPYC top-end wares but in comparing to 4th Gen EPYC also means higher core counts at the top-end. In being curious about the core-for-core advantages of 5th Gen EPYC, I managed to get my hands on the AMD EPYC 9655 processors for seeing how that model compares to the prior AMD EPYC 9654 \"Genoa\" flagship model. Here's a look today at how the AMD EPYC 9655 1P/2P 96-core processor compares to the prior EPYC 9654 flagship.",

          "description": "If you are looking for a weapon that can provide you with all-round abilities like accuracy, least recoil, and fast fire rate, then you should definitely check out C9 in Black Ops 6. Ever since I switched from XM4 to C9, I have been getting more kills in Bo6. \n\n\nWith that said, C9 is not as perfect as it seems, and it needs several attachments and perks to get the most out of it. To help you with that, here is a comprehensive guide to the best C9 loadout and build in Black Ops 6.\n\n\nWhat is the best build for the C9 in Black Ops 6?\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\n\nOptic: PrismaTech Reflex\n\n\nMuzzle: Ported Compensator\n\n\nBarrel: Reinforced Barrel\n\n\nMagazine: Extended Mag II\n\n\nFire Mods: Rapid Fire\n\n\n\nI personally like the PrismaTech Reflex optic, but you can opt for any optic that suits your preferences. It’s fine to use any scope that you want until it hampers the handling of the weapon.\n\n\nFor Muzzle, I go for the Ported Compensator instead of just a basic Compensator because it reduces the first shot recoil and gives a solid grasp in vertical recoil control.\n\n\nYou can use the Reinforced Barrel as it boosts C9's damage range and bullet velocity.

          "description": "ADSing is a term used in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 while explaining the Perk Tracker. However, it's a bit of jargon that isn't described in any manner in the game; here's what it actually means.\n\n\nWhat exactly is ADSing in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6?\n\n\nIn short, ADSing means to \"aim down sights\" in a match. This could be with an assault rifle with an impressive optics setup or a sniper like the SVD. The term is brought up when the game describes the Perk Tracker, which lets you see enemy footsteps and auto-ping enemies when you ADS them. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHow to improve ADS\n\n\nThere are some attachments you can add to your assault rifle to make it gain a faster ADS. For example, the Flip Mag magazine increases your aim down sight speed (ADS), Reload Quickness, and Sprint to Fire Speed. Unfortunately, the Flip Mag also has a weakness as it decreases your firepower and Magazine Ammo Capacity. You can unlock the Flip Mag at Level 29 of the weapon XM4, just as an example. The Fast Mag II also improves your Aim Down Sight Speed more dramatically.\n\n\nOther ways to improve ADS are by equipping the Quickdraw Grip, Commando Grip, or Ergonomic Grip to your weapon's Rear Grip. The Hipfire to ADS Accuracy stat can also be increased by putting on the Strelok Laser but keep in mind that the laser is visible while you're aiming down. However, this might be helpful with an SMG KSV. \n\n\nWhat decreases ADS?\n\n\nDisappointingly, there are many attachments that can decrease your ADS as well. For example, the Extended Mag II gives you much more magazine ammo capacity but decreases your ADS, Reload Quickness, and Sprint to Fire Speed. The Extended Mag III does this too to the ADS of your weapon but also slows down Reload Quickness, Sprint to Fire Speed, and Aim Walking Movement Speed. \n\nThe post What is ADSing in Call of Duty? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "We are excited to announce that Rise of the Dragon  is now ready for public testing. This is the first of a small number of games built using the DGDS (Dynamix Game Development System) engine.\nThe Dynamix name may be familiar – bought by Sierra in 1990, the Dynamix brand continued and became well known for action and puzzle games like The Incredible Machine, A10 Tank Killer, and Red Baron.  They also made a few adventures using the custom DGDS engine.\nRise of the Dragon is set in Los Angeles in a dark version of the future, circa 2053.  You play as Blade Hunter, a private investigator and retired police officer.  After a designer drug kills the mayor's rebellious daughter, Chandra, Hunter is hired to find the people responsible for releasing the drug on the streets. What Blade ultimately finds is much more than he expected.  Rise of the Dragon combines classic point-and-click adventure style with platforming arcade sequences, giving a unique gameplay combination.\nYou’ll need the latest daily build of ScummVM and files from the DOS version of the game, which you can buy at GOG (check our wiki for the required data files).  Please file any issues you notice on our bug tracker.\n>",
