It's the Switch 2 rumour train, back on the track and calling at Hushed Whispers and Vague Suggestion, with a brief stop to collect several fistfuls of sodium from Expectation Management. The latest rumours come from SoldierDelta on Discord via wcftech and suggest that Nintendo may have two models of its next console planned — with a digital-only version accompanying a standard model that would accept physical media.\nThe rumour comes from a user who previously posted information on Team Ninja's Rise of the Ronin several months ago, so while a healthy dose of scepticism is undoubtedly called for, this leaker does have some form, at least. The suggestion is that Nintendo is currently eyeing a $400 price point for the digital-only SKU of 'NG' (apparently a developer codename), with the regular model costing $50 more. September 2024 is apparently the launch date being eyed, with a fallback to November if there are any unforeseen production hiccups — again, this is all unconfirmed rumours at this point, though.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Make way for his Badgesty.\nThere are less than two weeks to go until we finally get our hands on the first original 2D Mario adventure in 11 years. It's an exciting time, especially for those who weren't fully sold on the presentation style of the New Super Mario Bros. series when it launched on DS way back in 2006. Super Mario Bros. Wonder, as you'll have no doubt gathered from our earlier hands-on impressions and videos, strikes out from the somewhat...well...overfamiliar gameplay mechanics of New Super Mario Bros. U and its Deluxe Switch revamp, in favour of a fantastical mashing together of lots of all-new ingredients.\nThis game feels much more in line with the breathless invention of Super Mario Galaxy or Odyssey; full of big ideas, bold art direction and, from our time spent with it so far, we're fairly confident that 20th October will see the launch of one of the very best 2D Mario games we've ever played. Mamma Mia, indeed.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It seems the team took note of this souring sentiment, however, resulting in more nuanced takes on the formula in more recent titles such as Fire Emblem: Three Hopes and Persona 5 Strikers (the latter co-developed with P-Studio). It’s continued this push with Fate/Samurai Remnant, a new standalone entry in the sprawling Fate franchise that provides an engaging action RPG experience that can appeal to fans both new and old.\nThe Fate series has expanded to become a vast and confusing multimedia soup of various canon and non-canon works, which can make following the narrative a rather tricky proposition, but Fate/Samurai’s story can readily be enjoyed both by franchise fans and newcomers. The story takes place in Edo period Japan and primarily follows a young man named Miyamoto Iori, a skilled swordsman who finds himself haplessly dragged into a supernatural conflict called the Waxing Moon Ritual.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

CRKD is the latest to tout a drift-free experience using this technology by way of the Nitro Deck, a hunk of plastic you slide your Switch console into, rather than controllers you slap on its sides.\nIt features all the face buttons, shoulder buttons, sticks, and whatnot that you’d need, plus a few extra ‘paddle’ buttons on the back that can be mapped to any other button on the controller should you wish. A super great feature for sure, but not really our thing. However, when we tried to follow the instructions provided with the device to clear the programming entirely, it just refused to work.

          "description": "In the nicest possible way, and with the greatest of respect, Remedy's comms director Thomas Puha would like people to stop fixating on frame-rate and resolution and get on with their bloody lives. Or at least, that's my summary of his thoughts following the recent announcement on Xitter that Alan Wake 2 will have a performance mode on PS5 and Xbox Series X, allowing consoleers for whom responsiveness is a priority to eke a higher frame-rate out of a game \"built from the beginning as a 30fps experience focusing on visuals and ambiance.\"\nPuha has subsequently been chatting to press about the creation of the mode and Alan Wake 2's visuals at large. In what has become a time-honoured ceremony for any AAA game developer a month or two before release, he took a moment to observe that focussing on frame-rate vs resolution is missing the wood for the trees. (The trees in question do take a toll on Alan Wake 2's performance, but we'll get to that further down the page.)\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I do love a game that tells you upfront what it's about while making nary a lick of sense, and visual novel Stop Burying Me Alive, Beautiful is certainly that. You are, indeed, being buried alive. The person burying you is your girlfriend, who waves aside your protests that you aren't dead yet, pointing out that this is exactly what a dead person would say if they were trying to avoid being buried. Can't fault the logic.\nClick the downward arrow below the animated image of your girlfriend burying you alive and you'll discover a murky fungal blackscreen where cartoon rats periodically try to eat you, unless you click to get rid of them. Below that, there's a kind of Alice in Wonderland-style alcove in which a tousled lady with a rat on her shoulder reassures you that being buried alive ain't so bad. As she points out, \"underground is like, the only place to escape capitalism, plus it's nice and cool\". Again, I can't fault the logic. Then she offers to play cards with you. The cards in question have rats doodled on them, including a wonderfully festive rodent Joker. There is passing mention of a \"rat god\".\nRead more",

          "description": "“Baldur’s Gate II set the model, and I obviously loved that model,” says James Ohlen. “But there were a ton of people at BioWare who didn’t like it.” During leadership meetings over the course of the Canadian designer’s 22 years at the RPG studio, he’d sometimes feel totally outnumbered when talking about the importance of story. “Game developers don’t get into the industry to create stories, they get into the industry to create games,” he says. “And so there’s this conflict between game developers and story - my entire career it's been a constant fight.”\r\n\n\r\nOhlen picked his side early. He was telling BioWare stories even before he joined the company. The meeting of Minsc and Boo, one of the most enduring partnerships in PC gaming, came about in a tabletop Dungeons & Dragons game he ran as a teenager. Then a comic book store manager, he took advantage of his premises to guide no fewer than three concurrent D&D groups through their campaigns. “I didn’t really have much of a life outside of Dungeons & Dragons,” he says. \r\n\n \nRead more",

One wonders if any of the people who worked on that have joined the union founded by CD Projekt RED employees this month. The union is part of the larger Polish worker's organisation OZZ Inicjatywa Pracownicza, and comes in response to CD Projekt's firing around 100 employees in July due to \"overstaffing\". Its membership is anonymous and open to people in the industry who aren't employed by the Witcher and Cyberpunk studio, but are thinking about forming a union in their own workplace.\r\n\n\r\n\"We started talking about unionizing after the 2023 wave of layoffs when 9% of Reds (that is roughly 100 people) were let go,\" reads an official FAQ from the group. \"This event created a tremendous amount of stress and insecurity, affecting our mental health and leading to the creation of this union in response. Having a union means having more security, transparency, better protection, and a stronger voice in times of crisis.\"\r\n\n \nRead more",

You see, he’s unknowingly stuck in a reality TV show where the penalty for unpopularity is death, and considering he has the personality of a pencil, his only option is to escape in genre-bending fashion.

          "description": "Correction: In 2022 the Axis series switched from titling its games for their current year to titling them for next year. Since I skipped last year's installment, and searches for \"Axis Football 2022\" brought up nothing, I got horribly confused and wrongly stated that the series skipped 2022 entirely. I apologise for this embarrassing error, and for not realising it until the exact moment everyone at RPS went home for the weekend. Although that latter part is at least quite funny.\nAxis Football 2024 is part of the little Americaball series that could. Since 2019 I've settled into a habit of skipping every second entry, only to learn that this time, its developers did too.\nThe result is still iterative improvement, but a more noticeable one in lots of small ways. Its animations in particular combine more naturally, with players visibly struggling to tackle, catch, or shake off an opponent. It feels like a punchier sport, making the significance of blocking and positioning clearer, and bringing out the drama that its coaching mode in particular really thrives on.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Diablo 4 has been on the back-burner amid the chaos of Baldur's Gate 3 and Starfield's launches, but much like an arch-demonness putting together the pieces of an inter-planar conspiracy, Blizzard have been doing a lot of work behind the scenes. The action-RPG's next big round of additions, the Season of Blood, launches on 17th October alongside the Steam edition of the game. It introduces a new season journey and questline, a new season event, and some skulking new enemies of the Nosferatu persuasion.\r\n\n\r\nThe new quest sounds quite fun from the promotional materials. It sees you investigating a mysterious outbreak of punctured necks, recruiting a local Van Helsing named Erys, and tracking down a Dark Master, while harnessing 22 juicy new vampiric powers care of some pact armour.  The latter range from turning into a cloud of bats, through cursing people, to treating yourself to a spontaneous bloodbath so as to enhance your channeled skills, The trade-off is that you'll have to acquire yet another Diablo 4 resource, potent blood, to perform these tricks.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The Electronic Wireless Show podcast returns to one of our recent previous messes to discuss Payday 3. More specifically, we look at the post-launch changes the devs are making in an effort to improve matchmaking and wait times. Specifically, we use this to think about games that have changed their reputations after a rocky start, what with Cyberpunk 2077's recent 2.0 update. What are the circumstances that allow games to do that? Why are they such outliers? How do we think about reviews in the context of something like No Man's Sky?\nWe've also been playing some big recent games, so tune in for discussions of Assassin's Creed Mirage, a call for pirate games, and a hilarious misunderstanding about Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor.\nRead more",

They'll grow in power the whole time, but you'll slow them by stealing and sabotaging with your team of colourful secret agents, who'll bash through gauntlets of mooks and monsters with munitions, magic, and mkicks to the stomach, mostly two action points at a time. All that makes for a colourful ride, and its 1930s setting and adventurous tone carried it for a while, but the more I played it, the more my wavering opinion turned into outright resentment.

Mirage cares not for being the glossy poster child of ray-traced glamour; it’s just a game that looks pretty nice and runs well on PC, older hardware and Steam Decks included.\nIt also keeps its list of graphics settings relatively brief, though there are a few in there that can dish out some extra frames per second at little cost to the visuals. Here it is, then: your complete guide to Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s PC performance, from its refreshingly reasonable system requirements to its best settings combinations.\nRead more",

Until now, all we've had to go on is a cryptic CG announcement trailer that showed a gaggle of identical clone-looking men in bright pink medical gowns, all of whom seemingly live inside a giant wheel full of shipping containers. It didn't really tell us anything about what the game actually is, or how it plays, and we've heard precious little about it since. \nHappily, I've now seen about an hour of The Alters in action at this year's Gamescom, and first impressions are very promising. This is indeed a game about sort-of clones living in a big wheely shipping container, but these containers are actually modules you'll be building in XCOM/Fallout Shelter-style chunks to advance the capabilities of your big wheel base as you work to escape the broiling heatdeath that's slowly enveloping the planet. You'll also be venturing out onto the planet's surface to gather resources, all while managing your crew of clo- sorry, alternate selves - as you assign their daily work tasks, and then there's the fact that, well, you're all chuffing different versions of the same person and the literal embodiment of what your life might have been like if you'd done X instead of Y, or Y instead of Z. It's a fascinating blend of ideas, and if 11 bit can stick the landing, I reckon it could end up being something really quite special. Here's everything I learned.\nRead more",

Whether you like it or not, Valve wants you playing CS2. For those who don't take their CS all too seriously, CS2 won't seem like much of a change from CS:GO, besides some grenade changes, more detailed maps, and a disappointing lack of fan favourite game modes. And for those who train their aim on the reg and line up their smoke grenades, CS2 might look the part but lacks the precision of CS:GO's movement and gunplay.\nStill, CS2 captures what makes Counter-Strike tick and even if the foundation seems a little sparse and a touch shaky right now, I'm confident Valve have an FPS that'll supersede CS:GO in time.\nRead more",

It's not like I'm snobby about the newer, more action-oriented Creeds; I welcomed the shift brought in by Assassin's Creed Origins, which shook the series up a bit, and I loved Cassandra kicking her way around Ancient Greece. Valhalla, although it had a relative dearth of things to parkour around, was a fun open-world RPG. Which I suppose is the point.\nAssassin's Creed hasn't been a game about a group of assassins following a creed and striking from the shadows for a long time. Here I would say that Basim, protagonist of Assassin's Creed Mirage kicks down the door and kills everyone in the room, except this new entry in the series is smaller, more focused, and once again concerned largely with stealth, and is all the better for it. So it's more appropriate to say Basim snuck in through an open window and is choking everyone out one by one.\nRead more",

          "description": "I'm a fan of the modern Bethesda RPG, having spent nearly 100 hours with Fallout 4 - which, for me, is a lot more time than I'm usually willing to give up. My fondest memories lie with Oblivion, because I think it captured exploration beautifully. I liked emerging from a big cave as a big nobody and striking out along a cobbled path, excited to go for a summer's walk. Skyrim abandoned Oblivion's warmth for your average fantasyland, but kept the great outdoors.\nIf I don't have an objective in Starfield, I sort of freeze over and don't really know where to turn. And even if I do, I perform a deep sigh and open up my menus and curl myself into a pinball, ready to get pinged around the innards of whatever can lies beyond the airlock in front of me. So far, Starfield's adventuring forces me indoors and it's a shame.\nRead more",

And how about the little animations of people hefting barrels of water? Man, it makes me want to jump in there and start stamping on everything, wailing and babbling like a mad god.

          "description": "In another reality, 2003's The Simpsons: Hit & Run — an action-adventure game that was by then the show's 22nd video game adaptation — might have slid quietly into obscurity. So why is it, then, that we can't seem to let it go? On YouTube, the game frequently resurfaces via longplays, speedruns, and retrospective essays that garner respectable amounts of views year after year. A few months ago, the game's lead designer told GamesRadar that he would support an official remake, mentioning that Hit & Run continues to be The Simpsons' most popular video game adaptation on Metacritic.\nYet Hit & Run's sustained relevance is, on its surface, a bit of an enigma. You'd be hard-pressed to find the game included in any critical canons or best-of lists, and there's hardly been a shortage of T-rated open-world games since its release. But for many, the game isn't just a source of nostalgia today; it was an introduction to a wholly new form of in-game self-expression. I looked into the still-growing community keeping it alive today.\nRead more",

This, of course, will bring some big changes to the gaming landscape, as Activision Blizzard has several major franchises under its belt, including Call of Duty and Diablo. \n\n\n\n\nMany people have been eager to know whether the acquisition will result in more Activision Blizzard games landing on Game Pass. On Twitter, the company clarified that it currently has no plans to put Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Diablo 4 on Game Pass this year. However, once the deal with Microsoft closes, it anticipates that more of its games will show up on the subscription service as soon as next year. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\nThe fate of Call of Duty following Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard\n\n\nWhile many players may not particularly care about the economic factors surrounding the development of video games, the Activision Blizzard acquisition is impossible to ignore due to the massive impact it will have. Some players have been concerned about Call of Duty's future following the acquisition. \n\n\nMicrosoft has clarified that the franchise will not be a console exclusive, at least for the next decade.

Granted, players have been asking for the FOV slider update in Starfield for around a month. But there are also requests for a brightness slider, along with a myriad of other accessibility options and quality-of-life features that are mysteriously absent from the game.

If you haven't been keeping up, this is your reminder that the event will go live soon, at 10am PT.\n\n\nThe event gives you access to hundreds of demos of upcoming releases from a variety of studios. You can also chat with some of the developers or watch livestreams. It's basically a celebration of everything that makes indie gaming so good.\n\n\n\n\nAt the moment, we don't know exactly what'll be featured, but the above video teases what you can expect to find. Did I just hear something about a Grim Reaper dating simulator?\n\n\nSounds Steam-y\n\n\nAnyone who games on PC knows that Steam is no stranger to events, celebrations, and sales. It's part of the reason Valve's service is still many people's go-to. While the Summer Sale is arguably the one that most look forward to, things like Next Fest offer up something in between the more mainstream events.\n\n\nSteam also turned 20 years old recently, which was celebrated with – you guessed it – a big sale. I still can't believe the studio behind Half-Life would go on to create one of the biggest PC gaming clients out there. Sure, there are great alternatives, such as GOG, Epic Games Store, and Humble Bundle, but Steam is pretty much the OG of this market.\n\n\nNext Fest goes on until October 16, so you have plenty of time to check out what's available from upcoming developers.\n\nThe post Steam Next Fest kicks off today appeared first on Destructoid.",

Last year's announcement that the series was making a return caused joy (and a bit of relief) in many fans' hearts. As well as brand-new interactive series, we're also getting a remake of Silent Hill 2, and some updates on Steam suggest we may hear more about this project soon.\n\n\nIf you head over to SteamDB – a third-party website that chronicles all things related to the Steam client – you can see that Silent Hill 2 has been quietly (dare I say...silently?) updated recently.\n\n\n\n\nOn October 6, Brazilian and Ukrainian subtitles were added, while Portuguese language support was removed, for whatever reason. Perhaps the most interesting thing to note, however, is the change ID above that says Steam achievements have now been added.\n\n\nWhat does this mean in terms of a release date?\n\n\nNaturally, many people (myself included) may conclude that news about the remake is imminent. Obviously, there's nothing officially saying this, but these recent updates suggest we might hear something soon.\n\n\nWe still have no idea when Silent Hill 2 will release, though a website did leak a potential date a few months back. Of course, the listed date was \"September 29, 2023,\" which obviously did not pan out. Still, it's interesting to see activity on the Steam page only a week and a half after that date.\n\n\n\n\nOn top of that, it was recently revealed that Silent Hill: Ascension would begin on October 31. Ascension is the interactive SH experience that viewers can influence in real-time. We know few details about this one, so we'll learn more when it launches on Halloween night.\n\n\nWill this (and the upcoming other entries) be the almighty comeback for Silent Hill many of us are hoping for?

They’ve put out a trailer for the game, as well as a demo for you to try it out.\n\n\nBased on the 1979 vector arcade title, Lunar Lander, Lunar Lander Beyond is a reimagining that ties a narrative and progression to the formula. Atari previously played it coy with a cinematic trailer that left a lot of questions. Especially considering the trailer’s more melancholy tone versus the synopsis, which boiled down to space deliveries.\n\n\n\n\nI personally love the original Lunar Lander, but I was wondering how Dreams Uncorporated was going to tackle it. There have been a lot of adaptations of the game’s fight against gravity gameplay in the decades since its release. I didn’t expect stress.\n\n\nThe press release says, “Beware of mounting stress levels, as they may usher in harrowing hallucinations and the onset of cosmic-induced madness!”\n\n\nYeah, I usually start hallucinating when I’ve got a deadline coming up, or I’m visiting with relatives.\n\n\nIt honestly doesn’t look that bad, but, like I said, I'm a fan of the original. You select your pilot, there are four different ships that you can customize, and there are 30 missions across five celestial bodies. From that trailer, it looks like there will be a decent amount of variety between the mission types.\n\n\nThe demo can be test-driven from 10:00 AM today, October 9th, through October 16th. I think that’s in Eastern Time.\n\nThe post Atari’s Lunar Lander Beyond gets gameplay trailer and demo for Steam Next Fest appeared first on Destructoid.",

Thus far, I’ve covered Valis, a port of a remake, and Syd of Valis, a bizarre chibi version of Valis II. However, I while I find them somewhat charming, I don’t love them. However, what I’ve been told, both in the comments and on other publications, is that Valis III is where the series actually got good.\n\n\nCertainly, it’s got the best narrative of the bunch, though that wasn’t a high bar to clear. It also has some neat added features, better level design and bosses, and a new bra for Yuko, so yeah, it’s pretty good. It’s all right.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nI got Valis III as part of a care package I received from Retro-Bit. They did a pretty swell job with a re-release through Limited Run Games.

Netflix confirms that Castlevania: Nocturne has been renewed for a second season.\n\n\nThe announcement comes a little over a week after its official launch on September 28th. There is no release date, only that the project is in active development. We did get a brief teaser through some storyboards and layouts in the new trailer, though.\n\n\nTotal Eclipse of the Heart\n\n\n\n\nThe trailer confirms Alucard, which is no surprise if you've finished the first season. Considering Ricther's lineage of games, we're likely to see much more of Alucard in the coming season than we did in this one.\n\n\nWe also seem to see Juste Belmont, touching the grave of his wife Lydie Erlanger, who was a supporting character in Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance. His absence is explained in the show, but he could prove another powerful ally for Richter and friends.\n\n\nIt does seem like the project is in the storyboarding phase, so chances are we won't hear anything for a while. However, director Samuel Deats said that the wait might not be as long as we think. For context, the first season of Nocturne was officially announced in June 2022, and premiered in September 2023.\n\n\n\n\nThe first season of Castlevania: Nocturne is available to stream on Netflix now. The original series, Castlevania, is also available to stream on Netflix. \n\nThe post Castlevania: Nocturne gets renewed for a second season appeared first on Destructoid.",

I felt that way about Detective Pikachu Returns this week, and I'm one of the few who actually played the original (that's just how 2023 is going! It's an onslaught, folks). But even if you don't partake in the recently-released digital follow-up, you can still order a Pokemon-branded coffee cup cozy soon.\n\n\nMy Nintendo just posted a hype blog for Detective Pikachu Returns, which includes details for Switch Online icons (which include a few general-purpose Pokemon avatars) and printable stationary/wallpapers, as well as a new My Nintendo physical reward: the aforementioned coffee cozy. It's yellow, it's cute, and it'll fit around a cup. You also get the satisfaction of knowing that it's not random big box store Pikachu merch, because this rat even has a hat; and there's magnifying glass/lightbulb imagery to let you know that the cozy is from Detective Pikachu.\n\n\nHere are all the details we have from Nintendo:\n\n\n\n\"Everyone knows that Detective Pikachu loves coffee—now he can keep yours warm (or cold!) with this adorable Detective Pikachu Returns Cup Cozy. This physical reward is coming. Stay Tuned!\"\n\n\n\n\nAs far as the My Nintendo storefront is concerned, \"stay tuned\" could mean anywhere from 1-7 days for the actual listing to pop up. While a Platinum Point price hasn't popped up yet, the lowest-cost comparable item in the store currently is 400p, so expect it to be in the 400-1000 range when it arrives.\n\n\nIf you need more platinum, we got you covered!\n\nThe post My Nintendo will be stocking a Pikachu Returns coffee cozy soon appeared first on Destructoid.",

If you get tired of your Tav’s current look, the Magic Mirror will let you change things up. Now, though, the Mirror will let you adjust arguably the most important aspect of your character: their name. That’s right, no more bemoaning the fact that you weren’t feeling creative when you started your campaign. Tav can finally get a truly unique name, like Frank or Jane. \n\n\nEven if you’re fully satisfied with your current character, this latest hotfix will still give you a reason to check out the Magic Mirror. You can finally use it to adjust the look of any hirelings that you decided to bring along on your journey. Anyone who didn’t get their character create itch satisfied at the beginning of the game can now dive back into the creator with a new character all over again. \n\n\nBaldur’s Gate 3 is the gift that keeps on giving.

Pre-orders are live now with a 10% discount as well as some pre-purchase goodies for those who choose to do so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As a small studio of thirteen, we’re so proud of the work we’ve put into For The King II. We’ve worked hard developing new gameplay innovations, features and systems that have built on the successful For The King experience to make it even more enjoyable. We can’t wait for players and friends to party up and start their adventure on November 2nd!\"\n-Sterling Andverson, Studio Directors of Iron Oak Games\n\n\n\nFor the King II builds upon the formula of the successful original. It blends strategic gameplay, JRPG turn-based combat, and roguelite elements that parallel a tabletop adventure. Also, players will now be able to co-op with up to four players as opposed to three.\n\n\nBased on the trailer, it looks like this is just more For the King. Which in my opinion is not a bad thing at all. I have dozens of hours in the original. If you can find a friend or two to play with it's a good time. However, I'll admit, itt can be a bit frustrating at times when bad RNG can cause the end of a run out of nowhere.

I’d say it’s an equally funny thing when you live in ignorance throughout an indie game’s development, only finding out about it when a release trailer is posted. In the case of Knuckle Sandwich, developed by Andy Brophy, I think there will be a fair amount of both column ‘A’ and column ‘B’ when the game drops in November.\n\n\n\n\nIf the game looks or sounds familiar to you, it’s been in development for a while. In fact, we’ve been reporting on it since as early as January 2016 — the flow of time isn’t real and it cannot hurt us. I belong to the camp of folks who are only finding out about this indie darling now, so when I say I am excited to learn that Knuckle Sandwich is set for release on November 23 — I mean it. \n\n\nIn the short release date trailer, we’re welcomed by a nameless, faceless entity who says “I know it’s been a while, but I think we’re ready,” and “It’s time for one last trip to Bright City” before a wormhole opens and consumes small video clips of the game, replacing them with the Knuckle Sandwich logo.\n\n\nIf you’re anything like me and are actively learning about this game now that there’s a release date, its page on Steam says Knuckle Sandwich is a turn-based RPG where battles are conducted via minigames such as “rhythm games, shoot-em-ups, memory puzzles, and quick-time events.”\n\n\nIt follows “a young man through his first day in Bright City – a bustling island paradise with a horrible secret. Find a new job, make new friends, and attempt to solve a mystery revolving around a ludicrous gang and a fanatical cult.” I don’t know about you, but they had me at ‘rhythm games.’\n\nThe post Indie RPG Knuckle Sandwich finally has a release date appeared first on Destructoid.",

Console ports are expected to follow soon after.\n\n\nThere’s way too much coming out in October. Laika: Aged Through Blood is described as Excitebike meets Metroid, as you explore a non-linear sidescroller world with a dirtbike betwixt your legs and a gun in your hand. I previewed it back in June and really enjoyed what I had played. I would love to review it, but it seems that every small and indie developer on the planet has chosen October to release their game. Maybe I can circle back for a console review when the ports follow.\n\n\n\n\nIf you have the time to try it, I suggest you do. It’s a nice mix of whimsical and brutal, featuring a tonne of violence and death. You play as a badass mom who is out for vengeance when birds decide to attack her village. Be warned, though. Aiming a gun and driving a dirtbike takes a pretty heavy amount of concentration. In my preview, I was concerned that having to stay focused for such a long period of time might become really uncomfortable and difficult.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the art style is terrific, the soundtrack by Beicoli is my new jam, and the premise is incredibly unique. Maybe check out the demo of Laika: Aged Through Blood and see if you dig it.\n\n\nLaika: Aged Through Blood releases on PC October 19, 2023.

          "description": "Atari has revealed that they're bringing Save Mary to their Atari XP cartridge line. This one is a bit more special because it was an unreleased title by Tod Frye, who would go on to program the N64 cult classic Battletanx. He uh… also programmed the Atari 2600 version of Pac-Man, which is attributed as a major contributor to the 1983 crash of the video game market.\n\n\nIt’s honestly a pretty fantastic Atari 2600 title. Or, at least, I like it. Your goal is to use a crane to drop bricks on a platform that is slowly being submerged in water. Mary is stuck on this platform and is relying on you to stack these bricks so she can escape. Also, don’t drop them on her because she’ll die a lot quicker from that than she would from drowning.\n\n\nImage via Atari\n\n\nSave Mary was apparently in development for a very long time and eventually canceled when Atari discontinued the 2600 in 1990. Atari founder Nolan Bushnell was quoted in Atarian saying that he was eagerly anticipating the title. Years later, eight of the prototype cartridges were unearthed and dumped onto the internet. Homebrew cartridges would later be sold using the prototype ROM. However, this will be the first time it has been officially released\n\n\nThe Limited Edition version is available for pre-order right now and is only having a 500-cartridge production run. It comes in a box based on the silver box format of 2600 packaging. It also comes with a manual. Neither the site nor the press release states if there will be a standard edition of Save Mary.\n\n\nSave Mary Limited Edition is up for pre-order right now. It’s estimated to ship 3 to 4 months from now.\n\nThe post Atari unearths Save Mary and slaps it on a 2600 cartridge appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It's not uncommon these days for a AAA game to launch, get met with backlash due to many issues, and the studio runs around trying to fix things. This is true of Payday 3, which saw matchmaking errors and a lack of offline features resulting in less-than-favorable scores for the game. Fortunately, developer Starbreeze is on the case, though its next update will take a bit longer than expected.\n\n\nOriginally intending to start rolling out this week, a Twitter post from the studio says the team is having to delay the sorely needed Payday 3 patch. The reason cited is the update \"needs some changes that would require us to go through console certification again.\" That, and the team wants to \"ensure its stability.\" \n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, we now have no release date for it, but the post goes on to say the developer should be able to send it out mid-October.\n\n\nTuning the heist\n\n\nStarbreeze did apologize for having to delay the update, with a second post underneath saying that the PS5 bonus content \"will remain unredeemable until this patch is ready.\"\n\n\nOn the plus side, there's going to be some additional server maintenance, so soon after the ones that occurred last weekend. An additional tweet from the official Payday 3 account says this maintenance will be going ahead between \"8am-11am CEST on the 6th and 10th of October,\" and will hopefully \"not be noticeable.\"\n\n\nWhile it's very easy to blame the studios themselves when games are released in poor states, there are always greater factors to consider. From what Starbreeze has said, it sounds like the team is scrambling to get things sorted. It's a shame we're having to wait a bit longer for the update, but hopefully it just means a more substantial and stable patch.\n\nThe post Payday 3 update delayed, studio issues apology appeared first on Destructoid.",

Wonder was met with many excited reactions; the art direction, the music, and the new enemies all looked like fun evolutions of what fans had grown accustomed to in the New Super Mario Bros. series. However, it was the final shot of the trailer that garnered the biggest reaction, as Mario grabbed an odd-looking fruit and turned into a massive elephant version of himself.

          "description": "Microsoft's long journey to acquire gaming giant Activision Blizzard is finally nearing an end. According to The Verge, a source familiar with Microsoft's plans indicated that it was aiming for Friday, October 13, as a date to close the deal. Ignoring the infamy of the date (it seems Microsoft and Activision Blizzard executives aren't very superstitious), it's not a surprising day to choose. Back in July, the two parties in the deal jointly agreed to extend the deadline of their agreement to October 18 in order to sort out any further regulatory concerns. At the time of publishing, that date is only twelve days away, so the deal would have to be closed soon.\nStill, the Microsoft legal department will have to deal with a few more legal challenges before they're completely out of the woods. After restructuring the terms of the merger to grant Ubisoft the rights to stream Activision Blizzard games in the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority granted the deal a preliminary approval, but the regulator still has to make a final assessment sometime before October 18. Still, Microsoft and Activision Blizzard each took this as a major win.\nWe are encouraged by this positive development in the CMA’s review process. We presented solutions that we believe fully address the CMA’s remaining concerns related to cloud game streaming, and we will continue to work toward earning approval to close prior to the October 18…\nSeptember 22, 2023\nThis news followed the companies' victory over the Federal Trade Commission back in July. At this point, it seems fairly likely that the deal will go through, ending a saga that began almost two years ago. After documents from the hearings leaked and revealed Microsoft's hybrid console, a new Xbox model, and plans to acquire other companies like Sega and Bungie, Microsoft is probably ready to leave the entire matter behind it.\n[Source: The Verge]\nHow do you feel about the acquisition coming to a close?

The Pale Reach is Dredge's first DLC, and it launches in just over a month. For more on The Pale Reach, check out the reveal trailer below.\n\n\nSet in icy waters, the DLC will include \"1-3 hours of content\" and is accessible at any point during a playthrough of the game. In addition to a new side story, the expansion will add 11 more fish and crab species to the world of Dredge, allow you to craft a ship add-on to break through small icebergs in the water, and add ice blocks to extend the shelf-life of some of your catches. The trailer also features new monsters, like a massive icy crab and a four-legged narwhal-like creature. The Pale Reach will be available to purchase on November 16, and Dredge is available on all major platforms. \nFor more Dredge, check out this episode of the GI show. Then, read about how the game's publisher, Team17, announced a wave of layoffs this week along with the departure of its CEO Michael Pattison.\nWill you be checking out Dredge's DLC?

          "description": "The Cyberpunk franchise has been on a winning streak lately. From the acclaimed anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunners to the 2.0 update of 2077 and the release of Phantom Liberty, public perception of the series has largely turned around. Today, CD Projekt Red announced that they're taking the next step with the franchise – creating a live-action production.\nThe game studio is partnering with Anonymous Content, a media company known for its work on shows like Mr. Robot and films like The Revenant. The project will be produced by Garrett Kemble, David Levine, Ryan Schwartz, Bard Dorros, and Charlie Scully, who will develop the project \"in close collaboration with the Cyberpunk 2077 creative team.\" That said, this is still in the earliest stages; there's still no screenwriter attached to the project.\nThere are still many questions in the air about the project. They've yet to announce (and perhaps, decide) whether it will be a film or a series. And while the project is \"set in the world\" of Cyberpunk 2077, there are a lot of approaches they could take. No actors have been attached to the project either, so whether Keanu Reeves or Idris Elba will show up is still up in the air. You can read the full press release here.\nFor more Cyberpunk, here's what we thought of the latest expansion, Phantom Liberty, and here's a list of tips and tricks to help you get started. After that, check out this feature to learn about lessons CD Projekt Red learned from the launch of Cyberpunk 2077.",

Now, as part of Atari's Recharged lineup, it has revealed Berzerk: Recharged, and its coming to consoles and PC later this year. \nThe original Berzerk is an arcade game released in 1980. In it, players controlled a top-down avatar while shooting through hordes of armed robots in an electrified maze. The big bad was Evil Otto, who bounced around the maze as a giant smiley face, hunting players down. Atari says Otto is back in Berzerk: Recharged, \"bringing with him updated graphics, deft twin-stick controls, and a new soundtrack by the acclaimed Megan McDuffee.\" \nCheck out Berzerk: Recharged for yourself in the announcement trailer below: \n\n\n\"Though he sports an ominous grin…",

It did so today with a short teaser trailer showing Lego-fied versions of fan-favorite Animal Crossing characters like Isabelle and Tom Nook. However, the teaser doesn't reveal exactly what to expect in terms of Lego sets or when we might see this collaboration hit store shelves.\nThe tweet accompanying the teaser says, \"Welcome to...LEGO Animal Crossing!\" The video itself shows Isabelle and Tom Nook looking up at the Lego Animal Crossing sky before pulling out to show even more Animal Crossing characters. All of them are watching a gift rise into the sky by way of a balloon, in classic Animal Crossing fashion; somebody get them a slingshot or two. \nCheck out the Animal Crossing Lego teaser trailer for yourself below: \nWelcome to…LEGO Animal Crossing!#AnimalCrossing #LEGO #Nintendo pic.twitter.com/un3R7QwlRC\nOctober 5, 2023\nThis Animal Crossing collaboration with Lego isn't the first time Nintendo and Lego have worked together on Lego sets.

It did so, and while the game looked great on both consoles, it was only playable at 30 FPS. PlayStation 5 owners were left wondering if Rockstar wasn't tapping into the power of the current-gen console to bring 60 FPS to the 13-year-old game. \nNow, weeks later, Rockstar has updated the PS4 port of Red Dead Redemption and the included Undead Nightmare DLC to include 60 FPS support on PS5 via backward compatibility. It did so randomly, with a quick tweet announcing the news. \nRed Dead Redemption, including Undead Nightmare, now supports up to 60 FPS on PlayStation 5 via backward compatibility. pic.twitter.com/XMLIe6gYo4\nOctober 4, 2023\nElsewhere in the same update, Rockstar added an option to enable subtitles upon first booting the game. The update also includes general bug fixes and improvements, although Rockstar didn't list which. \nIf you bought Red Dead Redemption on PS4 recently to play on PS5, or were looking for a reason to do so, this new update that adds a 60 FPS option might be the reason you were looking for. Now, Rockstar please bring 60 FPS to Red Dead Redemption II on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. And bring 60 FPS in Red Dead Redemption to Xbox Series X/S, too. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Red Dead Redemption review and then read our column on remembering the mundane greatness of John Marston.

After completing the game, it's safe to say that's definitely the case, with Mirage falling somewhere between where this franchise began and the modern RPGs of late.

By selecting diverging paths for other Jans during the alteration process, they acquire distinct skill sets. They become invaluable, not only for maintaining the base, but also for tasks like cooking, crafting tools for surface exploration, and gathering essential resources.\" \n11 Bit Studios says the Alters are more than mere resources, though, as they are sentient beings with their own emotions, problems, goals, and sometimes, existential doubts about their purpose. \n\"Despite their differences, their collective goal is to escape, echoing Jan's determination to survive: I'll just do it all by myselves,\" the press release reads.\n\nThe Alters is due out on current-gen consoles and PC sometime in 2024. \nFor more, watch The Alters' reveal trailer here, and then read Game Informer's reviews of 11 Bit Studios' other games: This War of Mine, Frostpunk, and Children of Morta. \nAre you going to check out The Alters next year?

Now, Nintendo has announced that online play and other device functionality that requires online communication is coming to an end, too. \nMore specifically, Nintendo says online services for these devices will end in April 2024. \nAs of early April 2024, online play and other functionality that uses online communication will end service for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U software. Thank you very much for your continued support of our products.\nhttps://t.co/nOyzBImHCE\nOctober 4, 2023\n\"In early April 2024, online play and other functionality that uses online communication will end for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U software,\" Nintendo's announcement reads. \"This also includes cooperative play, internet rankings, and data distribution.\"\nNintendo says it will announce a specific end date and time at a later date and that it reserves the right to discontinue these online services earlier if \"an event occurs that would make it difficult to continue online services\" for the 3DS and Wii U. It also notes this includes software exclusive to the New Nintendo 3DS. \nThe company then answers a number of questions in an FAQ section of the announcement. It notes that Pokemon Bank will still be usable following April 2024 and that \"for the foreseeable future, it will still be possible to download update data and redownload purchased software and downloadable content from Nintendo eShop.\" \nThe fan-favorite 3DS feature, StreetPass, will fortunately still work as it uses local communication between devices, but SpotPass, which uses online communication instead, will no longer be available after April 2024. \nFor more, read Game Informer's farewell to the Nintendo Wii U eShop. \nWhat's your favorite online memory of the Wii U or 3DS?

Now, Game Informer can exclusively reveal it hits PlayStation 5 on October 31, making this a great spooky experience for the holiday. \nFor the uninitiated, The Forest Cathedral is inspired by events surrounding real-life scientist Rachel Carson's investigation into Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, otherwise known as the harmful DDT pesticide. Publisher Whitethorn Games says this game is \"a dramatic reimagining of Carson's environmental science book, Silent Spring.\" \nYou can get a look at it in The Forest Cathedral PS5 release date trailer below: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, in The Forest Cathedral, players take on the role of Rachel in her new field research biologist position on a mysterious island. What begins as simply completing weekly work tasks becomes something more horrific when Rachel learns about what DDT is doing to the area. Whitethorn says players \"will slowly uncover the horrific effects of the pesticide using advanced environment technology to complete puzzles that weave together 3D exploration with 2D platforming.\" \n\nAs far as gameplay goes, players switch between Rachel Carson in a 3D world and the \"Little Man\" inside the 2D world of Rachel's scanning tools. It's in this 2D world where players will solve puzzles and complete platforming challenges.\nThe Forest Cathedral is available right now on Xbox Series X/S and PC via Steam. It hits PS5 on Halloween. \nAre you interested in checking out The Forest Cathedral? Let us know in the comments below!",

Set to hit PlayStation 5 exclusively on October 20, PlayStation and developer Insomniac Games have continued to ramp up excitement surrounding the sequel with trailers, gameplay, and more. And last night, PlayStation released a new extended 60-second TV spot that gives us a more cinematic look at these heroes' latest adventure. \nThe trailer is CGI and it's gorgeous. We see Peter Parker and Miles Morales come to grips with the challenges before them, both in the suit and out of it; all to the backdrop of a massive fight in broad daylight against Venom. If this trailer is any indication, Venom is quite the formidable foe for these two. \nCheck it out for yourself in the Marvel's Spider-Man 2 trailer below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 continues to look great, and fortunately, we don't have to wait long to get our hands on it because it hits PS5 on October 20. \nIn the meantime, read about how Marvel's Spider-Man 2 features more than 65 suits and then read our thoughts on the game after going hands-on with it.

Eurogamer also reports the news was delivered to employees during an emergency town hall meeting this morning.\nIn addition to members of the QA team, Team17 CEO Michael Pattison will also be stepping down, according to a statement received by VG247. This stands in sharp contrast to many other recent layoffs, where executives had been exempt from cost-cutting measures. You can read the full statement below.\nFor more on the recent wave of layoffs, read about how Sega canceled several upcoming games and how Epic laid off over 800 people.\n[Source: Eurogamer, VG247]\nWhat do you think about this year's massive amount of layoffs?",

Between its visuals, throwback gameplay, nautical tunes, and modern reimaginings of old-school adventure gameplay, it caught my attention. And now it's finally out!\nI spoke to developer Webbysoft, who is mostly just one person based in Australia, about Bilkins' Folly ahead of the game's release over email.

Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign. Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. \nAfter 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.\nJoin editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up. \nPart 1 - Surpr-iced! \nPart 2 - Bringing The Smoke\nPart 3 - Staff Meeting\nPart 4 - My Life As A Lin Kuei Robot\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

It’s up to you to destroy them first! The tricky part is many ECDs are connected to each other and can regenerate instantly, so you must figure out the right order to successfully complete your mission. \nOur reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Dark Side support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. Additionally, there are two playable demos if you want to test the game. Support for Amiga and AtariST will be available later! Please contact us if you have some other release.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build.
