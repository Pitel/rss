What's more, this one will be springing up quickly, with pre-orders opening on 9th January and shipping expected in March 2025.\nThis is a Super Rare Games joint, so naturally, there are a handful of goodies thrown in with each purchase. The boxed copy will retail for £37.20 (or your regional equivalent), including interior art, a full-colour manual, an exclusive sticker, and three trading cards featuring some of the game's characters. And yes, the full game is included on the cartridge, so don't expect any of that 'code in a box' nonsense.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Fire at Will.\nAs a mischievous omnipotent being once said, Star Trek isn't about mapping stars and studying nebulae, but charting the unknown possibilities of existence. The voyages of the starships Enterprise et al. are journeys of self-discovery. It's about the people we meet on those strange new worlds and what they teach us about ourselves. It's not about taking turns to phaser each other in the face. Despite issues elsewhere, that's where Star Trek: Legends really fails.\nIt's not all bad, though. Emerald City Games' turn-based trawl, published here by Qubic Games, debuted on Apple Arcade back in 2021 and though some may baulk at its mobile-first design, it translates fairly well to Switch. The UI is well-proportioned and the touchscreen integration functions as you'd hope.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Don't get us wrong, we'd absolutely bloomin' love a new entry, but we'd honestly rather see the likes of F-Zero and Chibi-Robo! make their grand return on the Switch or its upcoming successor.\nRegardless of whether or not you agree with us on this, it sounds like the Punch-Out!! series may well be dead and buried for good; at least with regards to developer Next Level Games. The lastest mainline entry, simply called Punch-Out!!, launched for the Wii in May 2009 with a WiiWare game entitled Doc Louis's Punch-Out!! following just a handful of months later. Thanks to the criticism levelled toward the former's use of stereotypical characters, however, it sounds like Nintendo isn't prepared to commence work on a new title anytime soon.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The rules of this cute minigame are simple: choose a dog, place a bet, and win big if your pick performs well. The unspoken rule is that you never pick the lone blue dog. Why? Because the blue dog never wins. At least, that's what we thought.\nBlue dog's racing abilities are poor, to say the least. No matter how many times we've played the minigame ourselves or watched others take part in speedruns, the colourful canine never seems to bring back top dollar. We were content to live with this fact (not everyone is cut for racing royalty, after all), but a handful of Majora fans dared to think more positively. If you can teach an old dog new tricks, then surely blue dog can get a win.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Look at that capital \"C\", poking out of the middle like the bow on a present whose silhouette leaves nothing to the imagination. You already know broadly what this game involves, yes? Indeed, you do: it's a game about crafting spacecraft, so that you can travel to other planets and craft their resources into other, better spacecraft.

          "description": "I come and go with the work of Ken Levine, celebrated auteurman and reported burnout-inducing manager, but I'm interested to see more of Judas, his current project at Ghost Story Games. The concept for Judas is that you're trapped in a computer-run society housed aboard a colony ship, the Mayflower. The titular Judas has managed to break free of the AI-groomed status quo, and is out to start a revolution. \"Bioshock Infinite in space\", we called it, back in 2022, but Levine says it's more open-ended than either of his Bioshock endeavours, with a greater emphasis on other characters remembering and responding to your actions over time.\n Read more",

          "description": "I think the last time I read an actual, original Garfield comic was in 1998. Since then, my experience of the character has been one long litany of Gar-memes and in particular, Gorefield memes. For those blissfully unaware, Gorefield is a version of Jim Davis’s otiose, lasagna-loving housecat who has broken his comic strip shackles and become a cosmic abomination. Gorefield's manifestations are many: centipede Gorefields, arachnid Gorefields, Gorefields that extend serpentine necks of unfleshed bone towards a cowering Jon Arbuckle, demanding to be fed in a voice that sounds nothing like Bill Murray, a voice as deep and velvety as the eternal Monday before the Big Bang.\nIn Gar-Type, a free Gorefield fangame from Youtuber and pixel artist LumpyTouch, Garfield has become a planet. The good news is that, unlike many other Gore-variants, this Gorefield is vulnerable to bullets. It falls to ace pilot Jon Starbuckle and his prototype starfighter, Gar-Type D, to save the Earth from lasagnnihilation.\n Read more",

That's because the studio is still working on the tech behind it all, and plans to release two other games before it. Meaning it'll be 10-15 years before it actually comes out. \nGreene describes Artemis as an internet-like platform where users create and share things, but doesn't say specifically what those things might be. He doesn't know how his user-led \"multiverse of worlds\" will be moderated, or how it will prevent copyright infringement, or what makes this idea distinct from, say, Roblox.

Developer Lionel \"Seith\" Gallat and his team have been working on another helping of haunted mouseketeering since 2022. But this is the first time they've properly blogged about it, sharing details of a gruelling switchover to Unreal Engine 5 and a couple of new screens.

I think that's the big theme of my selection box: being grounded within my player character. I want to feel what it's like to hike through canyons with too much sellable loot in my backpack. I want to park my soul in the head of a scared Scotsman way out of his depth, hundreds of miles from shore. The closer I can comfortably fit in my character's shoes, the more I seem to buy into the world they inhabit. Even if that world is constantly glowing a magnificent crimson. \nRead more",

          "description": "My selection box isn't really a selection box. It's a tray of barely-nibbled leftovers, hastily lifted from my Steam backlog. One of the disadvantages of being news editor, you see, is that I have  developed a goldfish-grade attention span. In my hectic pursuit of the next scoop, or the next Elden Ring update changelog, I snatch and cast aside game demos like a pickpocket speedrunning the checkout line at Harvey Nichols. I'm dimly aware that some of these cast-aside games are Very Good. A few might even deserve to be played for longer than 30 minutes. I feel immensely guilty about that. Perhaps a little... existential, too. I have measured out my life in tutorial levels. \r\n\n\r\nSo! Rather than digging out three of the games I've actually completed this year, such as The Crush House, Death Of A Wish and Mask Quest, I'm going to gamble on recommending a few I've barely scratched, but which sure feel excellent and have attracted a positive critical consensus. If I am false in this assessment, may Horace the Endless Bear bite my head off for my impudence. Let's begin.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Instead, I want to talk about mini PCs – not just small-form-factor desktops, but properly tiny, box o’ chocolates-sized computers – which have, of course, been around for decades.\nRecently, however, I’ve been wondering if mini PCs are finally on the cusp of having their moment as serious games machines. Between rising desktop component prices and ever-ballooning electricity bills, it would make sense that a smaller, cheaper system would take on a new appeal, and the success of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally show that convenience still trumps out-and-out performance for a lot of PC players. There have even been hints that Valve are resurrecting their Steam Machine mini PC concept, years after a flopping first attempt. Should you be interested?\nRead more",

Its structure most resembles Songs of Conquest or Heroes of Might and/or Magic, but with little RPG emphasis or base building, and minimal tactical fighting.\nTaxonomy is arbitrary and often unimportant at the end of the day, but I am very glad to firmly rule it out of one category: It's not a bloody card game. It looks like one, sure. You do most things with cards, and characters acquire more cards over time.

My weakest skeletons, sensing their death coming, explode into fire and shards. My strongest skeletons fight so hard and with such alacrity that upon dying, they drag their spirits together and keep fighting as ghosts for a while. Foul little bone scorpions skitter around on fans of legs made from human hands. Somewhere in the middle, almost invisible among the noise, is the character I am actually playing: Path of Exile 2’s mean-spirited, callous, and gleefully enjoyable Witch.\nThis is a review in progress. It has to be. Even in its incomplete early access period, Path of Exile 2 is a great sprawling mass of a game. Three meaty acts of a planned six act campaign are followed by a trickier return tour through them, before the absurd endgame kicks into gear and the real work begins. If I came to you having played everything on offer I would be wild-haired, bloodshot-eyed and possessing perfect, incomprehensible knowledge. Let’s compromise: I have toured the dark caverns and the antediluvian crypts. I have been killed by various accumulated nasties. I’ve had a great time.\nRead more",

          "description": "The announcement of The Witcher 4 with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's Ciri as protagonist has attracted a bit of discussion. Some of the reaction is online toddlers waxing wroth about a video game having a (somewhat older!!!) woman as lead character, and especially, shock, a video game in a series that has hitherto starred a man. And some of it is people commenting more thoughtfully on whether Ciri genuinely makes for a suitable Witcher protagonist, given that she isn't the product of the typical Witcher genetic modification regime (which is heavily tailored towards men), and given that, without spoiling too much, she has gifts that make crumbly old Geralt's sword-and-sorcery skillset look rather paltry. \r\n\n\nSpeaking to Eurogamer this week, game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber responded to a few of these comments, and also shared a little about Ciri's situation at the start of the game.\r\n \nRead more",

Later, I examined the senator's personal history more thoroughly and discovered he was \"hated by bears for cooking them a rancid meal.\" I suppose every politician has their enemies. \nThat Caves Of Qud creates fun anecdotes out of simple encounters shouldn't be a surprise. It has had 15 years of early access to establish itself as a small-but-mighty story generating roguelike of repute (there's a reason it sits deservedly side-by-side with Dwarf Fortress in the same publishing house). After creating many characters, and dying and dying and dying again, I understand why it grips the brain with such fierce glee. It is a machine of grand imagination and adventuresome comedy. A deceptively powerful RPG that isn't half as obtuse to newcomers as the screenshots make it out to be. Qud's low-res bark is just a complement to its bite.\nRead more",

Sin once described writing news articles for our former news editor Alice0 (RPS in peace) as like practising backflips in front of the kung fu master. Writing about a new city builder at Sin's suggestion is like being invited to budget the development of Londinium by Julius Caesar.\nThe terror of screwing it up - together with other, more trivial distractions, like international games industry conferences - has stopped me from writing about Times Of Progress for months. Today I bite the bullet, and emerge from my lodgings to issue a hesitant speech to the masses, hoping like hell that Caesar is too preoccupied with the latest Gaul uprising to notice my errors.\r\n \nRead more",

Your job is to disassemble toys - five in all - according to his eldritch written instructions, and either \"salvage\" them or \"sentence\" them to the incinerator.\n Read more",

          "description": "A master thief creeps over cobbles in an early modern metropolis that splits the difference between Edinburgh, Glasgow and Liverpool. Lit by gaslamps that can’t quite dispel the industrial haze, they pass for a civilian - a rough one, admittedly, but not shady enough to cause an itch in the swordarm of any passing guard.\nUntil, that is, they take to the thieves’ highway - following the trajectory of their grappling hook upward to the rooftops, from which they can see the shape of the city, and the moon beyond. Up here, it’s a parallel world - the trees on street level answered by chimney stacks, and the distant hills echoed by the rise and fall of steep gables. “We’re super proud of these rooftops,” says Greg LoPiccolo. “It’s an amazing landscape that we put a lot of thought and effort into, and it’s a lot of fun to traverse.”\nBack in 1998, LoPiccolo was the game director who saw Thief: The Dark Project to completion. Today - after an 18 year detour to Harmonix to lead projects like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, among other adventures - he’s the game director of Thick as Thieves. “It really is an opportunity to do something unique and cool and new, on the shoulders of this stuff that is now well-respected,” he says. “Thief has some legs, right? People still talk about it to some degree.”\nRead more",

Just saying, this had better be good, Geoff, especially after the 2023 show’s \"embarrassing\" shooing-off of developers whose acceptance speeches cut into that valuable trailer showcase time.\nWho will need to please wrap it up this time? Which games will be revealed? Will there be a musical number to top last year’s Herald of Darkness performance? (That was fun, actually, fair play on that one.) You can find out right along with us, as we once again fire up the RPS liveblog-o-tron to report all the developments as they happen. Even the ones that happen at 3:45am, when I’ll be desperately trying not to collapse into my keyboard like a felled tree.\nRead more",

          "description": "At first I thought Marvel Rivals was basically rebranded Overwatch, in the way it's a free-to-play PVP hero shooter. And in some ways, it is. Fights are like if you took a MOBA and forced both teams to bash heads constantly. Success lies in picking off Spider-Man or Squirrel Girl or Marcus Fenix so as they wait to respawn, you hop on the big area that needs capturing. Or you push the cart while tanky Hulk absorbs bullets with his biceps and John Marvel snipes from afar.\nThe more I played Rivals, though, the more it hit me that it's specifically a messier, more complex Overwatch. A hero shooter with a surprising amount of polish and charm, sure, but also one that slides off my brain like water off Birdman's back. I understand why it's supremely popular at the moment and yet, I really don't.\nRead more",

The result of the poor performance reportedly comes down not just to the incredibly prohibitive price but also to a lack of content.\n\n\n\n\nApple is reportedly still developing the Apple Vision gen 2, though its production has seemingly also halted due to the original's poor performance. Though things look dire for the product, Apple hasn't fully stopped production, rather just slowed it down, looking to bring it back to full steam should the Vision Pro's sales ever pick up. Apple is seemingly also looking into making a cheaper headset, which would be an effective way to deal with the Vision Pro's greatest issue.\n\n\nBloomberg had previously reported that Apple was looking into incorporating Apple AI into the future versions of the device, so we'll see how this news affects those plans.\n\n\nMany of the mistakes committed by Apple in the making of the Vision Pro could've been averted simply by looking at the high-priced and low-selling PSVR2 headset. Instead, Apple chose to make an even more expensive and even less interesting product.\n\n\nYou can currently still acquire the original Apple Vision Pro for its original price.\n\nThe post Apple reportedly halted production of the ridiculously expensive Apple Vision Pro because of poor demand appeared first on Destructoid.",

Its damage rates were nothing to write home about, and its charge time took a tad too long. Fortunately, CoD's first-ever 2025 update is here to finally give a good name to these swords.\n\n\nOne of the first significant changes is the sword's ability to now hit two enemies per swing, including additional strikes to any other zombies close by. Hit damage rates have also been raised to 100 percent at close-to-medium distances, making undead takedowns easier than ever. The Elemental Swords feel a lot more like classic Wonder Weapons, which have always been the most powerful in the weapon collection.\n\n\nThe update adds another handy feature, allowing the player to counter the Amalgram's deadly grasp by swinging …",

          "description": "2025 seems to have had the wildest possible opening for EA FC 25, as an accidental glitch has ended up gifting players a copy of Erling Haaland Winter Wildcards card in Ultimate Team.\n\n\nThe incident was first reported after the content update time (6 p.m. UK time) on January 4 when the NumeroFUT promo went live. Incidentally, the glitch was triggered by a free pack that is part of an ongoing objective. It's safe to say that those who managed to complete the objective late have been rewarded with a New Year's gift.\n\n\nEA FC 25 Erling Haaland Winter Wildcards glitch explained\n\n\nIt all starts with the Season 4 Weekly Play Completionist objective, which rewards players with special packs. To earn these packs, players have to complete certain tasks on a weekly basis. So far, players have managed to complete the objective tasks for Week 1, which rewards players with a guaranteed Winter Wildcards/Winter Wildcards Hero pack.\n\n\nThis pack on its own is pretty special, as you're guaranteed a promo card (excluding icons). However, those who have managed to either save the pack or complete it just in time were almost guaranteed a Winter Wildcards Erling Haaland. Most of those who have opened the pack late have ended up receiving the ST version of the Norwegian striker.\n\n\n\n\nAs of writing, the card costs over a million coins on the Ultimate Team market. Technically, someone could have been incredibly lucky and ended up receiving the item from the pack. However, what happened tonight is certainly a glitch. It reminds me of a similar incident that happened last year in January when an SBC inexplicably ended up giving a TOTY Messi card to many.\n\n\nIt remains to be seen if EA Sports will take any action regarding what has happened and if there will be some sort of compensation in the future.\n\nThe post EA FC 25 glitch ends up gifting guaranteed Erling Haaland Winter Wildcards in Ultimate Team appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Midnight Grinch is one of those rare Roblox titles about exploring the lore and surviving the nights.\n\n\nYour sole objective is to escape the Grinch, and also serve the customers while uncovering the secret of the place. To reach the final ending, you'll need to survive the Grinch's attack, which will be a lot harder than you expect.\n\n\nHow to survive in Midnight Grinch\n\n\nIn Midnight Grinch, the job of survival is spread over three nights, but lasting the first two is easy. It's the third night when all the fun (or horror) begins. On the third night, you'll meet the Grinch, who will capture you. Here are a few tips you can try to escape.\n\n\n\nLeave the Grinch's lair before the time runs out. When trying to escape, make sure not to fall. If you fall, it's game over, and you'll need to use Robux to revive yourself.\n\n\nTry hiding in the lair or the Bakery. There's also a chance for you to get the Grinch stuck inside the Bakery. However, he can sometimes follow you upstairs.\n\n\nIf the Grinch follows you upstairs, move around and come back to the first floor. Move out of the Bakery for the time being to get extra time to save yourself.\n\n\nYou can also use the gun, which will load one of the three available endings.\n\n\n\nAll endings in Midnight Grinch\n\n\n\n\nThere are three different endings, which will be triggered based on your in-game actions.\n\n\n\nHappy Ending: This is the ending where you manage to kill the Grinch. To do so, you'll have to purchase a gun and use it on the Grinch the moment you see him. The moment will arrive when you're close to the Bakery, but you'll need to have the gun with you.\n\n\nSurvival Ending: You'll have to survive until the timer runs out. If you manage to be alive till then, the Grinch will run away, hearing the police sirens.\n\n\nBad Ending: This is the Dead ending where you just end up, well, dead. This sequence happens if the Grinch can catch you before the time ends, and you end up dying.\n\n\nThe post All endings in Midnight Grinch Roblox: How to survive appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The White Lotus and Iridescent Lotus are two valuable items in Jujutsu Infinite when it comes to opening chests inside the game.\n\n\nYou can obtain several resources like Energy Nature and Maximum Scrolls in the game. They are used to directly craft an item or unlock advanced skills like Domain Expansion or Maximum Techniques. To do so, you'll often need to increase the odds of opening chests, and both White Lotus and Iridescent Lotus will improve the chances of getting better items.\n\n\nLet's look at how you can obtain the White Lotus and Iridescent Lotus in Jujutsu Infinite.\n\n\nHow to get White Lotus in Jujutsu Infinite\n\n\nThe two main ways to get the White Lotus in Jujutsu Infinite are opening chests and trading from the Curse Market. Since its a Rare item, you can get it frequently when opening a chest. The chances will only increase if you have used consumables to improve your luck. You can also trade for it directly from the Curse Market, given its availability.\n\n\nWhen used, the White Lotus removed all common items from the next chest you open. It's a pretty helpful item, but it's also the weakest type of Lotus in the game.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHow to get Iridescent Lotus in Jujutsu Infinite\n\n\nThe Iridescent Lotus is one of the hardest items to find in Jujutsu Infinite. Typically, you can either trade for it from the Curse Market or try your luck with chests. The Iridescent Lotus is a Unique item, so the odds of obtaining it are extremely low. Even if you get a Unique item, it might be something else. To improve your chances, make sure to use Beckoning Cats.\n\n\nThe other option is the Curse Market, but again, it all boils down to your luck. Once you use this particular Lotus, you can only get Special Grade items from your next chest. Use this item only if you're desperate to get something extremely rare from your next chest.\n\nThe post How to get White Lotus and Iridescent Lotus in Jujutsu Infinite appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Perhaps what makes Stardew Valley such a hit that keeps people coming back for more is the fact that it's quite a cozy game. Its pixelated visuals hearken back to the olden days of gaming, which goes in stark contrast to the usual AAA appeal of hyperrealistic visuals and gun-toting violence.\n\n\nSo successful is Stardew Valley that, as of December 2024, the game has sold over 41 million copies worldwide since it launched back in 2016. That's across all platforms, according to the official website, with the Nintendo Switch port alone accounting for 7.9 million copies.\n\n\n\n\nWhen you consider that – as noted by Eurogamer – February 2024 saw the game reach a milestone of over 30 million copies; this means over 10 million more units have shifted in less than 12 months. Some of this may have come from the big 1.6 update that went live in 2024.\n\n\nFrom small beginnings\n\n\nMuch like Minecraft, Stardew Valley came from humble beginnings, making an enormous splash in the indie gaming scene that caused a tsunami in the mainstream. Are these watery puns doing anything for you? No? Right. Noted.\n\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, Stardew is one of the biggest-selling video games of all time. With over 41,000,000 copies – and no doubt this number will keep going up – that puts the small farming simulator ahead of Mario Kart Wii, Super Mario Bros. Ultimate on the Nintendo Switch, and Cyberpunk 2077. It's got a long way to go before it topples the likes of the aforementioned Minecraft or even GTA 5, but I suspect Barone does not have aspirations for such dominance.\n\n\nIn any case, Stardew Valley is living proof that the indie scene is capable of doing just as well what big developers with a budget of millions can do. I must admit, it's been far too long since I booted the game up. But since the console update started rolling out not long ago, now might be a good time to dive back in.\n\nThe post Stardew Valley has now sold over 41 million copies appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "GTA 6 is going to be the biggest release of this generation, if not of all time. I know it. You know it. Luddites who have shunned modern society know it. While we still don't know exactly when it'll be released, we can safely say it'll be quite the money spinner for developer Rockstar Games. But how much is it likely to make?\n\n\nWell, according to a report from PCGamesN – which points to a paywalled article from the Financial Times – it’s estimated that GTA 6 could earn about $3.2 billion within its first year of launching. This comes from DFC Intelligence, a company that specializes in market analysis.\n\n\n\n\nOver three billion in sales within 12 months is an astonishing amount. But consider that this doesn't include the $1 billion revenue the upcoming Grand Theft Auto release could earn from pre-orders alone. For some perspective, as of August 2024, GTA 5 has racked up around $8.6 billion in its lifetime, according to figures. Bear in mind that came out in 2013.\n\n\nThat's enough cheddar to make a cheddar galaxy\n\n\nGrand Theft Auto has been one of the most successful video game franchises in history. The fifth installment alone has gone down as the second best-selling game of all time, at around 205,000,000 copies sold worldwide (Minecraft is still reigning champion at 300,000,000 copies).\n\n\nThe hype for GTA 6 is all too real, with theories and speculations a-plenty. We're anticipating Rockstar will release it sometime this year, possibly in the fall or maybe later. But we've got no solid information to go off, so all we can do is wait.\n\n\nSuffice it to say, the sixth entry is going to be somewhat lucrative for its developer (as well as parent company Take-Two Interactive). They may as well tell us that GTA 6 will earn a bajillion dollars. I'd easily believe it. I also pity the studios that are looking to release their games around the same time. \n\nThe post GTA 6 could make over $3 billion in its first year, analysts say appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Now that the holidays are over, the Prehistoric Island in Blox Fruits on Roblox is a bit trickier to find. However, it's still possible to discover, even solo. This is the best way to find the Prehistoric Island in Blox Fruits now that the holiday event is over.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHow to find the Prehistoric Island solo\n\n\nThe best way to find the Prehistoric Island in Blox Fruits if playing solo is with the use of Permanent Buddha and Portal buffs. With the event ending, there's no more permanent easily accessible Prehistoric Island in Blox Fruits, but it can still be found. If you want to search for it solo, it's best to do so with the Permanent Buddha and Permanent Portal buffs, as they make the process much faster and easier, but they can only be acquired with Robux. Ironically enough, both are available right now as a bundle for 2,999 Robux in the Blox Fruits shop.\n\n\nHop in your ship, and begin your search for the Prehistoric Island. This is best done with the Sentinel ship, though any will do. Because your goal here is to search before it spawns elsewhere, you want to escape to the Portal Dimension if any Sea Event spawns in the area you are searching. For example, if you see a Sea Beast pop out of the water, just pop your Dimensional Rift portal, and then immediately jump out. Any Sea Events that spawned near you will have respawned from this helpful trick. If you take damage from Piranhas while escaping to the Portal Dimension, feel free to stay in there a little longer and heal up.\n\n\nBy making use of your ability to instantly teleport to the Portal Dimension, you can escape any Sea Event while searching for the Prehistoric Island, which is what makes this possible solo. Of course, you'll still need some good RNG to actually find the location of the Prehistoric Island before it respawns elsewhere, but by being able to escape the many Sea Events on the open sea, you can successfully continue to search for it.\n\n\n\nThe post How to find Prehistoric Island in Blox Fruits appeared first on Destructoid.",

To begin, you'll have to talk with Santa Claus NPC and follow the next set of instructions. Let's take a look at how to get the Candy Cutlass Blade and what's the easiest way to do so.\n\n\nHow to obtain the Candy Cutlass in A Universal Time (AUT)\n\n\nThe first step is to go to the center of the town, and you'll find Santa Claus behind a blue-colored wall. The next step is to defeat 20 Hooligans. Go to the eastern part of the map, and you'll find an empty Skate Park to find them (they will have 'Hooligan' mentioned in their title, along with their levels). You can defeat them quite easily, just make sure not to get stunned by their attacks.\n\n\nThe next step involves obtaining the Candy Cutlass Blade by defeating the Grumpus Boss.\n\n\nHow to Defeat Grumpus in A Universal Time (AUT)\n\n\n\n\nYou can meet the Grumpus Boss in the Ice Fortress, and he spawns once every 45 minutes. You'll have to talk with Bawxstar NPC at the Christmas Tree, and he will take you to the Ice Fortress. The Grumpus has two types of attacks.\n\n\nHis ground slam is pretty strong, but you can completely evade it with the correct timing. The other attack type is a set of punches with short range, and you can also dodge them quite easily.\n\n\nTo make matters easier, you can play as a group. In that case, make sure to do at least 10% damage to be eligible for the rewards. Defeating the Grumpus doesn't necessarily guarantee the blade, so be prepared to repeat the process.\n\n\nOnce you get back the blade, take it to the Santa Claus NPC, and he will change it to the Candy Cutlass with a fresh set of moves.\n\nThe post How to get the Candy Cutlass in A Universal Time (AUT) Christmas Update appeared first on Destructoid.",

Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.

Nemyslel bych si, že devadesátiminutová sekvence statických fotografií s hudbou, zvukovými efekty a vyprávěním může tak dobře fungovat. (Ilča 70 %)",

Trápení je v průběhu filmu trochu permutováno, ale jde pouze o střípky, které (záměrně?) nevytvářejí žádný dramatický celek, natož zápletku. (Ilča 50 %)",

A je důležité říct si něco o tom, o jakou podívanou vlastně jde a v čem přesně spočívá ten \"remaster\".\nU zrodu tohoto počinu stálo elektronické hudební duo Daft Punk, které v roce 2001 vydalo své album \"Discovery\". K písničkám z alba vyšly animované videoklipy, které produkoval Leidži Macumoto, což byl kultovní japonský výtvarník (zemřel loni), který měl na svém kontě mnoho animovaných seriálů, především ze 70. - 80. let (nejslavnější z nich byl asi \"Space Battleship Yamato\"). Daft Punk ho oslovili proto, že na jeho seriálech vyrůstali, takže výsledné dílo, včetně \"jednodušší\" retro animace a naivní zápletky zcela záměrně připomíná staré japonské televizní počiny (n…",
