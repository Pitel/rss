The hat makes you look like an eraser pencil from Forbidden Planet. It's the kind of headgear worn by the kind of criminal Batman's too grown-up to fight anymore. But it has, nonetheless, roused in this under-dressed stranger a sense of Dionysian frenzy. He will do anything for that hat - hewing your arms off, ripping your intestines out, tearing the skin from your ribcage. And you, in turn, will do anything to rob him of that mattock, because by the gods, it looks a lot more dangerous than the candlestick you're trying to fend him off with.\r\n\n\r\nThere are many such lost souls in the bleak, midnight world of the Half Sword demo - all lurking near candle-lit piles of randomly spawned hammers, stools, barrels, axes and lengths of wood, all subject to unforgivably authentic physics and cursor-based attacks that conspire to transform every scuffle into a Monty Python blooper reel.\r\n\n \nRead more",

What is Fucksweeper? Discerning videogame cognoscente that you are, I feel like you should be able to read the title and form some broad conclusions. But for those who never owned a Windows PC in the 90s, Fucksweeper is a free, titillating, revolting, beautiful, apocalyptic new version of classic avoid-the-bombs grid puzzler Minesweeper that incorporates elements of dating sims and a vast quantity of generative AI filth. Maybe turn down the volume before watching this video.\n Read more",

While a Frostpunk 2 or Manor Lords might have you grapple with the elements, here it’s all about balancing a fickle audience and Tinseltown’s seedy underbelly. Maybe making some worthwhile art, too? Sorry, did I say ‘worthwhile art’? I meant to say “lots of money.” Let’s get clicking!\nFirst up, I need to name my studio (I settle on Horace's Revenge) as well as my crack new team of business bastards. There’s my chief legal officer, Jebediah End. My CCO, Anne Egg, and CFO, Rummy McLastdrink. He doesn’t have a sauce problem, because obviously I wouldn’t put him in charge of money if he did. In the wreckage of the studio, we find an unedited film reel hidden in the waffles n’ cocaine cupboard. It’s a noir thriller named ‘Messenger Of Death’. Whatever influential critic is currently directing this era’s discourse has chosen to categorise each film as genre percentages (‘60% detective/40% thriller’), and setting (‘modern American city’.) Let’s just hope those pigs in the stands recognise a solid gold picture when they see one!\n \nRead more",

But these spaces are just as mesmerising to fly through and think about when not focussed on finding the perfect line through the next corner, or avoiding a patch of grass.

That’s basically the high-level concept for brilliant sci-fi comedy show Severance, right there. Not wanting to spoil any more than I absolutely have to, I’ll present you with two facts up top. 1. It features a touching queer relationship between John Turturro and Christopher Walken and 2. It’s some of the best television I’ve seen in the last few years.

Sorry, not freegans - freegunners. Freeganism is a portmanteau of \"free\" and \"vegan\" referring to people who fish jars of near-spoiled hummus out of supermarket dumpsters according to an ideology of minimal resource consumption. Freegunners, meanwhile, are lairy Guardians Of The Galaxy-alike mercenaries with phat guns and playstyle-defining secondary abilities. They do not consume hummus as far as I know. The game is out 23rd August 2024, with a beta happening in July, and I've got an overview trailer for you below.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "To kick off with some extremely half-arsed mytho-geometry, the original Frostpunk was a testament to both the design utility and the inexhaustible political symbolism of circles. When people wish to found a community of equals they commonly form a circle, with each participant visible and audible to the rest. A circle is also the best shape for defending against an engulfing ambient threat such as a global ice age, because it has no weak points, and it makes a great centrepiece for a videogame interface, a symmetrical motif that can be tuned and adorned to either suck your attention into the screen or distribute it evenly in all directions.\nCreated by Polish developers 11 bit, Frostpunk takes place in the middle of a circle, an Arctic crater with a huge coal generator at its heart. Your city rises in rings around that generator, each additional layer of dwellings corresponding intuitively to decreasing temperature, and the result is one of the most focused and thematically consistent specimens of its genre - a building game that feels as intimate and urgent as tending a campfire. Frostpunk 2's new campaign mode breaks the circle open. It starts where you (hopefully) ended, with the crater now fully colonised and evolved into a glaring, blue-orange geode of high-density housing and clustered chimneys. But the view has been pulled back, and construction now unfolds along the plains and canyons beyond the crater, which consist not of circles but of hexagons - another UI designer's favourite - on which you'll plot out upgradeable districts rather than assembling individual buildings. \r\n \nRead more",

You’ll quickly realise this a school-with-no-trousers-esque dream sequence, but the matted mess of thick black cables that carpet this dingy side-stage is painfully accurate. Pissing around with gear is roughly 70% of the band experience, in my limited experience of being in bands. This probably changes when you’ve got roadies or dedicated tech people, but we did not, because we were skint. And also terrible. Several hours of Deathbulge has brought me more joy than several years of being in actual bands. I had some isolated good times in some of those bands, but I’m having a very good time with Deathbulge.\n \nRead more",

In addition to going up to 16 cores versus 8 with the Xeon E-2400 series, the more competitive pricing, the 3D V-Cache SKUs, and 28 PCIe lanes rather than 20, the AMD EPYC 4004 models also support DDR5-5200 memory where as the Intel Raptor Lake E-2400 models are bound to DDR5-4800. In this follow-up testing is a look at the AMD EPYC 4004 performance both at DDR5-4800 and DDR5-5200 speeds for showing the performance difference.",

We also got the inside scoop on its release date, set for November 8, 2024.\n\n\nSlitterhead's gameplay trailer unveiled a plethora of grotesque monsters. Then, it showcases the playable characters, taking them down one by one. One move, in particular, involves a claw-like attack that brutally slices up the creatures. \n\n\n\n\nAnother playable character is shown in the trailer, but this time with a shotgun weapon. There seem to be a few fighters you can wield with this entry, each with their own robust power. You can even teleport to other locations to make a quick getaway from the monsters. \n\n\nBe sure to tune into Slitterhead's release on Nov. 8, 2024, on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Steam, and the Epic Games Store.

There are surely a few fighters left from Capcom's history to pull in. But in another way, this is the closest we can get to a new Capcom vs. SNK, so I'll take it.\n\n\n\n\nHere's the rough schedule for Year 2 of Street Fighter 6's character rollout:\n\n\n\nM. Bison - Summer 2024 \n\n\nTerry - Autumn 2024 \n\n\nMai - Winter 2025 \n\n\nElena - Spring 2025\n\n\n\nThey'll likely be available as either individual purchases, or one big bundle.

          "description": "Monopoly GO Treasure hunt events are recurring monthly events that allow you to dig up hidden items to complete levels. You'll obtain various rewards as you advance through each level, including cosmetics, dice, and a Wild Sticker. However, while grid sizes stay the same, treasure locations vary from person to person.\n\n\nAre Treasures dig event grid random in Monopoly GO?\n\n\nThe grid layouts, size, and treasures in Monopoly GO's treasures events are pre-determined, meaning they're the exact same for every player. However, the locations of the treasures are random, so you won't be able to use video guides or screenshots to pick the same dig spots as other players, as your treasure items may not appear in the same squares. \n\n\nIn short, if you're playing Monopoly GO with friends or family, you'll have the same treasure event rewards, number of levels, and grid layouts as them, but the treasure locations will differ. You could have a treasure appear in a random corner of a huge grid, while someone else may have the same item spawn directly in the center. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nNonetheless, you can still share ideas and tips with others based on a treasure event's grids and items. Although item locations are random, there are still strategies you can use to make levels easier. For example, if you have a 3x3 item as your last treasure and only two possible spawn spots left, focus on those rather than a random 2x2 area on your grid to reduce your odds of wasting precious pickaxes.\n\n\nBeyond this, Monopoly GO's Treasures dig events are mostly luck-based, as your item locations will spawn in completely random areas. If you're lucky, your first pickaxe will find a treasure immediately, allowing you to clear out an item or two quickly. Otherwise, you might have to sacrifice a few to narrow your options.\n\nThe post Are Monopoly GO Treasures event grids random? appeared first on Destructoid.",

Now it's back for another round of glorious battle in Volgarr the Viking II, which is coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam and GOG on August 6, 2024.\n\n\nYou can see some of what developer Crazy Viking Studios has learned since releasing its debut game back in 2013 in the announcement trailer below.\n\n\n\n\nIt's wild to think about how many similarly challenging indie games have been thrust into players' hands since the original Volgarr launched. The space is more crowded than ever before, and it's also full of a ton of quality efforts within the same genre. As such, Crazy Viking Studios has evolved in some ways and is looking to offer players the means to hone their skills before putting them to the ultimate test on the battlefield.\n\n\nAmong those modern upgrades are features like practice mode, checkpoints, save profiles, and even the option to run through with unlimited continues. These additions may not wholly sate Volgarr's bloodlust, though, so you'll eventually want to try a run without them to see everything the sequel has to offer. As the description states, foregoing these \"modern comforts\" will allow you to unlock everything Volgarr the Viking II has to offer. \n\n\nVolgarr the Viking II was initially unveiled as part of this week's Guerrilla Collective showcase. It's nice to see the release date land in that August sweet spot, giving us plenty of time to sharpen our steel again with the first game before diving into the second. \n\nThe post Volgarr the Viking II revealed for consoles and PC, launches this August appeared first on Destructoid.",

While some can be discovered through general exploration, others must be obtained during specific missions. In this guide, we'll focus on how to get the Facet of Sacrifice in Destiny 2: The Final Shape.\n\n\nWhere to find Facet of Sacrifice in Destiny 2: The Final Shape \n\n\nDestiny 2: The Final Shape's Facet of Sacrifice can be found in the Iconoclasm main campaign mission. It'll appear sometime after the defeat of the Dolgith, Blade of Reasoning. If you've already completed this quest, you can replay it on either Normal or Legendary mode via The Pale Heart map.\n\n\nAs you tread the pathway to the mission's waypoint, a broken statue will come into view. This is your cue to turn left and venture into a room where the Facet of Sacrifice lies.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nPlayers must reach the upper level where a light shines. To do so, hop on the doorframe on the left and then jump to the elevated area.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nKeep going through the openings of the pathway, resulting in the Facet of Sacrifice location. The Prismatic Fragment grants you a bonus Darkness Transcendence with an activated Arc, Solar, or Void buff. You can equip it via the Prismatic subclass section under Fragments.\n\n\nMore Prismatic Fragments can be found in other Destiny 2: The Final Shape main campaign missions. For example, Dissent and Ascent include these shiny new abilities on their respective pathways. Explore the rest of The Pale Heart map to collect them all, essentially becoming a Prismatic master.\n\nThe post How to get Facet of Sacrifice in Destiny 2: The Final Shape appeared first on Destructoid.",

Mobile players will need to wait as of writing, but that won't be for long. In an official blog post, EA Sports has announced that Euro 2024 tournament mode will also be released for mobile devices, albeit with some changes.\n\n\nFC Mobile Euro 2024 tournament mode release date\n\n\nFirst comes the release date, as the community will be anxious to try this new mode. In many ways, the upcoming tournament will resemble the FIFA World Cup mode, released in 2022. The Euro 2024 tournament is coming to mobile devices on June 11, 2024.\n\n\n\n\nHow to play FC Mobile Euro 2024 tournament mode\n\n\nThe upcoming mode will feature all 24 qualified nations with authentic kits (Switzerland and Austria being the exceptions) and squads. Matches can be played at six different difficulties (you'll have to select at first). You will also be able to edit the selected lineup, and change tactics as required to get more wins. \n\n\nThe group stages are based on real-life fixtures, but knockouts depend on your in-game progression. Once you win the tournament, you can share it with the rest of the world on social media. EA Sports will also introduce two new stadiums inspired by real-life locations:\n\n\n\nOlympiastadion Berlin\n\n\nBVB Stadion Dortmund\n\n\n\nYou'll also earn different rewards after completing the tournament, but EA Sports has yet to share all the details. More information is expected to arrive in Ultimate Team once the release date comes closer.

After a teaser trailer and a behind-the-scenes look at the game's development, we finally have our first look at gameplay. Plus, the studio announced Slitterhead launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on November 8.\nRevealed in a new trailer during the 2024 Summer Game Fest showcase, Slitterhead's debut gameplay trailer starts in a Chinese city, with a police detective searching through a trashed ally. He finds what appears to be a mangled body in a trash can before the trailer shows more of the neon-lit Chinese metropolis, with shots of (presumably) our playable protagonist jumping from high above to the ground below while using some spectral power that allows them to possess bodies of pedestrians. We also get a look at Slitterhead's monstrous creatures and third-person survival action gameplay, which features both guns and melee combat. \nCheck it out for yourself in the Slitterhead gameplay trailer below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Slitterhead is looking quite action-packed, especially compared to Toyama's Silent Hill efforts. However, the lineage is clear. \nSlitterhead has largely remained a mystery since its reveal. We know in 2021, Toyama said he was working on a choice-driven game, and we assume that's Slitterhead. Toyama also told IGN Japan his next project (presumably Slitterhead) would be released in 2023. Obviously, that didn't happen, but now we know it's releasing this November. Outside of that, a behind-the-scenes video diary showed a few clips of Slitterhead, including training room-esque encounters, a neon-lit Chinese city, and even a dog that appears to be playable. \nSlitterhead hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on November 8. \nWhat do you think about this first look at Slitterhead's gameplay?

Today, we received another pre-rendered trailer, so while we're still not sure how the game will look and play, we at least have a better idea of the game's tone and characters.

Public officials have been abducted, including Batman associates Commissioner Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent. The Rats have pledged to execute them in one week’s time for “crimes committed against the people of Gotham City.”\nAs widespread rioting engulfs the city, Batman races to prevent this so-called “Day of Wrath,” but it all goes wrong.\nSet between the events of Batman: Arkham Origins and Batman: Arkham Asylum, you’ll experience the origins of such iconic characters as The Scarecrow, Harley Quinn, and more, as Batman grapples with the contradiction at the core of his identity—the use of force in pursuit of\n\nThe press release for the new trailer promises the game will have a \"blend of exploration, stealth, and free-flowing combat the series is known for.\" The game is coming exclusively to Meta Quest 3 next year.",

          "description": "After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.\nJoin Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

That has been remedied somewhat thanks to the addition of five Game Boy titles starring the Blue Bomber.\nRight now, Switch Online subscribers can enjoy the following Game Boy titles:\nMega Man: Dr. Wily’s Revenge\nMega Man II\nMega Man III\nMega Man IV\nMega Man V\n\n\nFor those unaware, the Game Boy series of Mega Man aren’t just ports of their NES counterparts. Rather, they’re a separate series of original games and are differentiated by the titles’ use of Roman numerals instead of numbers. You can more or less think of them as Mega Man’s versions of the Super Mario Land series, and while they feature their own plots, levels, and bosses, they incorporate some mechanics and enemies from the NES entries. While these aren’t the original NES games fans likely would have hoped for, it’s cool to have the lesser-known Game Boy titles accessible on modern hardware. \nYou can stay updated on the Nintendo Switch Online’s retro offerings by visiting our complete database of available games.",

Revealed during today's Guerrilla Collective showcase, Arena is a prequel to Kiborg and it's coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam) sometime this summer. \nIn the full game – Kiborg – players must fend of waves of foes as Morgan Lee, the leader of a ragtag group of resistance fighters on the prison planet of Sigma. \"Strike with punishing hand-to-hand combat skills, blast mechanized soldiers with firearms, and deploy cybernetic-enhanced abilities to devastate bloodthirsty baddies. Learn to dodge, block, and parry adversaries to set them up for the killing blow.\" It sounds and, given how it appears in the trailer below, looks a lot like Sifu, which is a great combat-centric brawler from 2022. \nCheck out the Kiborg action in the trailer below:\n\n\nIn Arena, players find \"Morgan Lee, who sends the clones that fight on his behalf out on missions, fighting in Sigma's Colisseum. Here, Morgan's clones will square off in bloody battles against other denizens of the prison planet for the cash to help keep his resistance going.\" Arena also features an Endless Mode, which Sobaka says spawns an infinite amount of increasingly difficult enemies to overcome.\nIn the full game, players will gather resources to unlock permanent upgrades, form alliances, and research forbidden technologies to gain the upper hand. \nHere are some Kiborg screenshots: \n\nArena launches this summer on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

Now, thanks to a new PlayStation Blog post detailing the game's preorder contents, we know it will cost $39.99. \nThat same blog post says Concord will launch with 16 playable characters known as Freerunners, 12 unique maps set on various in-universe worlds, and six distinct team-based modes. And that content will \"expand shortly after launch with regular, post-launch updates\" for all players at no additional cost. \nHere's a look at the Concord box art: \nAlongside the standard $39.99 edition of the game, PlayStation and Firewalk are releasing a Digital Deluxe Edition for $59.99 that includes additional cosmetics to customize your Freegunners and 72-hours early access to the game's August launch. Preordering the game, regardless of edition, also gets you (and up to four friends) beta access and the Monarch cosmetics pack. \nHere's a look at the Concord Digital Deluxe Edition: \n\"Seeing Vale and other Freegunners in action in gameplay footage is one thing, but there's no substitute for experiencing the game for yourself,\" the blog post reads. \"That's why we're hosting a pre-launch beta, simultaneously on PS5 and PC with cross-play support. Those that pre-order will have an opportunity to be among the first to play Concord.\" \nThat beta is set to happen this July before Concord launches on PS5 and PC on August 23. \nFor more, watch the Concord reveal here. \nHow do you feel about Concord's price point?

The threequel to the hit animated films is being produced by Rovio Entertainment, creators of the Angry Birds franchise, in collaboration with Sega and Prime Focus Studios.\nRed and Chuck are back, with Jason Sudeikis and Josh Gad reprising their roles, respectively. It will be directed by John Rice (The Angry Birds Movie 2, Beavis and Butt-Head Do the Universe) with a screenplay written by Thurop Van Orman (The Angry Birds Movie 2, Adventure Time, The Misadventures of Flapjack). DNEG Animation will bring the film to life, as opposed to being handled by Rovio and Sony as with the last two films. Prime Focus Studios, which co-produced The Garfield Movie, is set to produce. \nA press release provides no details on the plot nor a release window. If you’re wondering why Sega is now involved, the company purchased Rovio last year. Given that the two previous films were box office successes and have grossed a combined $500 million worldwide, it’s a little surprising we haven’t gotten a third film already. \nWhile we wait for more information on the film, you can read our review of The Angry Birds Movie 2 here.

And both games are great; read why in Game Informer's Octopath Traveler review and Game Informer's Octopath Traveler II review. \n\n\nTo celebrate the series being available on all current platforms and PC (via Steam and Windows), developer Team Asano has released a free update to Octopath Traveler II that includes an \"Extra Battle\" mode that becomes available after defeating the game's final boss. In this mode, players can test their skills against newly added extra-tough opponents – including the main characters from the first game. This mode has been available on Xbox consoles since launch but is now available on PlayStation, Switch, and PC. \n\"Since its launch in 2018 with Octopath Traveler, the Octopath Traveler series has sold over four million copies worldwide, popularizing the unique HD-2D art style: a striking blend of 2D character designs in beautiful 3D worlds,\" a press release reads. \"Both games are a standalone experience set in different worlds with eight distinct protagonists, each with their own stories to explore and Path Actions to use.

So much so that showrunners and directors Craig Mazin and Naughty Dog president Neil Druckmann realized it would need to tell its story across more than one season. \n“The story material that we got from Part II of the game is way more than the story material that was in the first game, so part of what we had to do from the start was figure out how to tell that story across seasons,” Mazin said. “When you do that, you look for natural breakpoints, and as we laid it out, this season, the natural breakpoint felt like it came after seven episodes.”\nEven though Season 2 will be shorter than Season 1, one of its episodes is said to be \"quite big\" in length. The showrunners also tease that a potential Season 3 will be much larger in scope. Despite this, Mazin doesn’t believe they can tell the whole story in two seasons because they want to take their time. “And indeed, the story may require Season 4,” he says.\nHBO has not yet renewed The Last of Us for a third or fourth season, but Mazin believes it will happen, “as long as people keep watching.” \nFor those worried that Season 2 would rush through Part II's events, it seems you can relax. We'll see where the story stops when The Last of Us Season 2 kicks off in 2025. To get a look at what the season has in store, you can take your first looks at Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey’s Joel and Ellie, and read about the castings for Dina, along with Manny, Mel, Owen, and Nora. Actor Jeffrey Wright was recently cast to reprise his role as Isaac.\n[Source: Deadline]",

The open-world game is the latest entry in the Nikki series of fashion games, which is very popular in Asia, and Westerners are getting their biggest exposure to it yet with this charming adventure. \n\n\nThe game unfolds on the magical continent of Miraland, and Nikki must save it. Her main power is \"styling,\" which involves changing clothes from different nations, allowing her to adopt unique abilities. For example, one outfit allows her to float while another cleanses corrupted creatures of demonic energy. The trailer shows one outfit that lets players summon a giant flower to glide through the air. Another ability shrinks her to the size of her small companion, Momo, to access tight areas and other locations. \nThe more outfits you collect, the more abilities Nikki has to solve puzzles and overcome platforming obstacles. But despite the \"save the world\" premise, Infinity Nikki is billed as a relaxing adventure. You can also catch bugs, go fishing, and gather resources to craft new outfits, among other activities. \nInfinity Nikki looks wild, and fans can get their first taste of it in a beta test happening during Q3 of this year. The game is coming to PlayStation 5, PC, iOS, and Android but has no release window.",

In the trailer, we get a few glimpses of some Xenomorphs, the tracking device we'll be using to avoid said Xenomorphs, and a look at some pods that indicate we might be fighting more than one. \nCheck it out for yourself in the Alien: Rogue Incursion gameplay trailer below: \n\n\nIn a new PlayStation Blog post, Survios chief product officer TQ Jefferson explains that Alien: Rogue Incursion was developed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. Jefferson also shares that the \"high tension shooter\" tasks players with exploring an \"overrun facility on the inhospitable planet Purdan.\" \n\"Dynamically spawning and pathing with countless unique possibilities, even we couldn't tell you exactly where and when each Xenomorph will strike, let alone what strategies it might use or if it'll bring some friends,\" the blog post reads. \"While heart-pounding combat is the core of Alien: Rogue Incursion, grabbing your pulse rifle and blasting your way out of every situation is not always the best strategy. \n\"Constantly hunted by unpredictable and resourceful Xenomorphs, players will often find creativity and a level head to be their greatest weapons, especially when it comes to leveraging the environment to their advantage.\" \nAlien: Rogue Incursion hits VR this holiday season. \nAre you going to check out Alien: Rogue Incursion later this year?

We received a new trailer for the beloved game alongside the announcement during today's State of Play presentation. \nUntil Dawn puts you in control of eight teenagers/young adults who venture up a mountain for a fun night in a secluded cabin. In typical slasher-movie fashion, there is much more than meets the eye regarding this cabin and its surrounding area. Relying heavily on player choice, Until Dawn's narrative uses a system called the Butterfly Effect, where pivotal choices you make have consequences that go far beyond that which you can immediately recognize. The game stars actors like Rami Malek, Hayden Panettiere, Meaghan Martin, and more.\n\n\nOriginally announced as a full remake of the game, the trailer footage does not appear to be a significant step up in terms of visuals, appearing to be more in line with the industry's definition of a remaster. PlayStation's official description says it's been \"rebuilt and enhanced for PS5 consoles and PC.\" Developed by Ballistic Moon, this improved version also boasts new environments, collectibles, and re-cut narrative sequences. \nWe loved Until Dawn when it arrived on PlayStation 4 in 2015, awarding it a score of 9 out of 10. In the time since Until Dawn's original release, Supermassive has released other games in the genre, including The Dark Pictures Anthology and The Quarry. The studio is currently working on The Casting of Frank Stone, a game set in the Dead by Daylight universe. Until Dawn arrives on PlayStation 5 and PC this fall.",
