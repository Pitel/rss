There are a whopping nine ships to choose from, all with different behaviours, pros, and cons, meaning it takes time and effort to figure out what works for you. Some have disappointing spread shots but killer secondary weapons, while others have access to a teleport that’s like playing Russian Roulette.\nEach ship’s base features are fairly eccentric, too. You have several different speeds, moderated by two different firing modes and the 'L' and 'ZL' triggers, which slow you down to a crawl if desired. Teleports work on a quick recharge basis and can be used to get out of clinches, but you need a moment to prep it before you can use it, and this timing requires expert precision and knowledge in later stages. All said and done, the effort involved in finding your comfort zone will either be alluring or excessive, depending on your sensibilities.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "New trailer showcases each character.\nYou would be forgiven for forgetting about Curse of the Sea Rats. The self-proclaimed 'Ratoidvania' - a pun which, despite our best efforts, we cannot endorse - had a hugely successful Kickstarter campaign back in 2020 and was quickly confirmed for a 2021 release. Obviously, this release date was not met, but it looks like the rat is back as a new trailer provides a closer look at the game's four playable characters and re-sets the release date to 2023.\nThis new trailer (found above) gives us a fresh look at the game's 'Ratoidvania' (nope, it's not sticking) layout, as you will play as one of four characters - David Douglas, Buffalo Calf, Bussa or Akane Yamakawa - battling through a labyrinth filled with enemies in an attempt to return to your human form. There is a slight dissonance going on here between the 2D hand-drawn characters and the 3D environments that doesn't quite sit with us at the moment. Then again, this is a game about people getting turned into rats so it would make sense if the world isn't quite as it seems.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

However, a short time later, a spokesperson from EA stated that this information was incorrect and that physical copies will still be available to purchase in all areas.\nThe original story, shared by video game industry analyst @MauroNL3 on Twitter, suggested that the company was to undergo an 'economic restructure' in which it would move away from the production of physical copies of its games such as FIFA and Battlefield and focus solely on the development of digital resources.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "And can you believe Odyssey launched five years ago today?\nIt's kind of scary to think that Super Mario Odyssey is now five years old; that's half a decade! Launched back on October 27th, 2017, Nintendo was already firing on all cylinders at that point, having released the likes of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and Splatoon 2 earlier the same year. It was perhaps Super Mario Odyssey, though, that truly cemented the Switch as a console to be reckoned with, putting to rest any concerns that fans may have had after the short-lived and rather disappointing Wii U era.\nAfter five years, though, is it high time Nintendo announced a Super Mario Odyssey sequel? We've seen the company experiment with direct sequels before with Super Mario Galaxy 2, but is this something the fans want to see from Odyssey, or would you rather Nintendo go all out on a brand new Mario game? Well, a few members of the Nintendo Life team have put their thoughts together on what a new 3D Mario game might look like, what locations might be included, and when the heck it'll see the light of day.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "I pity anyone who has to review, or god help them, write a guide for Terra Invicta, because doing it even semi-comprehensively would take longer than I expect to live.\nThis is a hugely ambitious game, covering something I've never seen before, with a scope that makes Europa Universalis seem limited. It is a complicated, huge, and ponderous alien invasion simulator that constantly threatens to drop the other boot on you the entire time. Anything you do could be the butterfly whose little wingflaps eventually result in the obliteration of the planet. It is not a game to be powered through, but to be played and contemplated exclusively for a solid month.\nThat is its central weakness. But I think it had to be this way. Its commitment to an idea is demanding, but if you can tolerate some issues with clarity and presentation, the payoff for meeting it is utterly unique.\nRead more",

Any time in the past couple of weeks that my friends and colleagues thought they were talking to me, they were in fact talking to an exquisite Italian neon-folk horror game wearing my skin and looking out of the eye-holes in my skull. On at least one occasion I lay in bed at 3am, sweaty and frozen in half-asleep fear, because I thought I'd heard a strange rattling noise...\nIn fact it was not stillness, but the panic-sprint into darkness that became my main and oft-unsuccessful tactic whenever I heard the creature of Gravoi. Gravoi itself is a small but inconveniently maze-like fictional Sardinian town, host to a yearly folk festival that, every so often, involves the unwary being carried off and killed by a... something. Unfortunately, four very unwary outsiders - rendered outsiders for a variety of reasons, whether they're locals or not - find themselves having to survive the night of this festival, armed with things like matches, firecrackers and a polaroid camera.\nRead more",

When you use code HUKDAW3821DW, this monitor drops from £1299 to £899, an incredible value for a monitor of this spec. \nLet's quickly run through those specs. This 38-in monitor has a resolution of 3840x1600, essentially a shorter version of 4K, with a 144Hz refresh rate. The monitor is Nvidia G-Sync Ultimate certified, meaning it has a physical G-Sync module to prevent judder and tearing, and it also gets bright enough to earn the lofty DisplayHDR 600 rating.

As familiar as one can get, anyway, with a monster list of 30-plus display and graphics settings, not even counting all the granular DLSS and FSR options for compatible graphics cards. \nAfter Lord-knows-how-many breachings and clearings of the same damn oil rig, I believe I’ve cracked these options and found the best settings combination to balance nu-MW2’s sharp visuals with smooth, steady performance. The latter can be a big ask of older, weaker PC hardware,  despite some innocuous system requirements, but with the right tweaks it’s easy to get at least a solid 60fps on most modern GPUs and CPUs.\nRead more",

The undead are faceless as well, so you don’t feel too bad about escorting them back to their graves. Yet they can be poignant, dramatic reminders of friends and family that meant a lot to characters too, depending on who the shambling corpse used to be. If I was going to hire any enemy for a game, I’d hire a zombie. Then they’d eat my brain. That’s why I hired them! So to celebrate our very iconic, vitality-challenged friends, I've put together a list of my favourite zombie games.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It wasn't a neck-and-neck, ebb-and-flow struggle between two equal powers. Instead I played RTS games as though they were city-builders, with the added bonus of absolutely steamrolling through the AI when I'd had enough fun.\nThis was true of basically every RTS I played back then. In Starcraft I'd amass an army of Protoss Carriers and launch them across the map. In Supreme Commander, I'd tech all the way up to the Experimental Weapons, and then send the colossal CZAR Mothership to Independence-Day the entire enemy base. But my favourite variation of this was in Impossible Creatures: a wonderful early noughties strategy game where you create your own units by stitching together parts from different animals.\n Read more",

          "description": "Horror games are usually a bit too scary for me to play alone. I actually barely manage to play them at all, though not for lack of trying. Whenever I load them up, I just can’t help but pause every five seconds for a breather. Multiplayer games are far more manageable, though, and often also turn stifled screams into contagious laughter as your friends terrorise each other.\nIf you’re a scaredy cat like me and would rather scream at the horrors of your unhinged mates than at unpredictable AIs and scripted jump scares, then you’re in the right spot. Here are five games in which your mates can play as the monster. Some are creepy, some are cute, and none of them will force you to run around alone. If you're looking to get monstrous yourself this Halloween, Liam's done a list all about games that make you the monster. No overlap, promise.\nRead more",

This was upsetting to me; this may come as a surprise, but I try to avoid playing and reviewing games I think I won't like. I don't want to go out of my way to be mean, and I also don't want to spend hours not enjoying myself. I go into almost every game I play actively wanting to enjoy it (the exception being things like Succubus, which I can only assume are trying an avant garde technique to plumb new, unexplored depths of badness on purpose).\nAs it turned out, a lot of other reviewers did like it. I'm not going to object to that, because it takes all sorts to make a world, and so on. Rather, it made me wonder if I'd sort of hallucinated how much I liked the first Tales From The Borderlands. How fantastic it was, managing to be both the best Telltale game and the best Borderlands game in one, was a big part of why I was so excited for New Tales. It came out a long time ago, and I hadn't played it for a while. Maybe it wasn't how I remembered. Maybe I'd changed, you know?\nRead more",

It's like, it's a wheelbarrow. I know what that does!”\r\n\n\r\nTo Isgreen, it’s this level of accessibility that’s carried Age Of Empires all the way to today’s 25th anniversary. The instantly legible historical warfare  -  “pikemen, ranged units and cavalry” - paired with randomised maps that promised, effectively, an infinite amount of replayability; “It just had a lot of features that I think players really loved and kind of defined itself along those features in a way that, yeah, it's just outlasted everything else.”\r\n\n \nRead more",

I was all geared up for some science fiction-tinged Spice Girls shenanigans, but I was left bitterly disappointed. However, I’d already installed it, so I decided to check it out and see what kind of game it actually is. Turns out that Victoria 3 is a grand strategy game, just like its Paradox stablemates Crusader Kings and Hearts of Iron.\nTrying to classify Victoria 3 is pretty damn important. Unlike, say, the Total War series, Paradox’s grand strategy titles are differentiated by a lot more than their time periods. Hearts of Iron its WW2 military ticker on its sleeve, while Crusader Kings (my personal fave) is secretly an RPG, just one that happens to cast you as the ruler of a country, rather than a random wandering murderer. Figure that out and you grasped the appeal of the game, especially for people who may lack interest in - or be downright put off by - the historical era it covers.\nRead more",

Over the course of it all, though, there's been a gnawing, slightly dreadful realisation slowly bubbling away beneath the surface. Far from being scared by these horrible things, I've often come away feeling no emotions whatsoever. I have remained unmoved, neither frightened, unnerved, or creeped out. Just plain, simple indifference. The Japanese Ring? Nothing. I Saw The Devil? Nah, mate. Lake Mungo? More like Lake Yawngo.\nI was beginning to think I'd lost the capacity to feel anything at all.

It is also, err, a collection of the last games in the series. The bundle comprises Uncharted 4: A Thief's End and The Lost Legacy, a standalone Uncharted adventure featuring ladythieves Chloe Frazer and Nadine Ross (they are thieves who are ladies, they don't steal women). Uncharteds 1-3, on the other hand, are nowhere to be seen. In fact, the only way to play them on PC right this second is to buy an expensive PlayStation Plus Premium subscription and stream them via the cloud as part of the Nathan Drake Collection - a far from ideal solution.\nThis puts us PC lot in a bit of a pickle. Naturally, if you haven't played any of these PlayStation exclusives until now, you're missing three entire games worth of story context. So, is it worth starting with Uncharted 4? The short answer is, \"Yes\". The long answer is, \"Yeeeeeeeeeees - probably\".\nRead more",

Despite a relatively good looking rendition of the iconic gothic metropolis and a pretty engaging story, Gotham Knights ultimately failed to capture my imagination. \r\n\n\r\nIt didn't help that throughout my time with Gotham Knights, I was thinking about the Arkham series. Rocksteady's trio of Batman-em-ups are essential superhero games, titles that redefined the genre and provided a template that still feels contemporary to this day. Aslyum, City and Knight fully immerse you in the Batman fantasy, successfully crafting a depiction of the caped crusader that was deadly, capable and - perhaps best of all - human.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "There's a particular battle in the first chapter of Tactics Ogre: Reborn that I've been banging my head against all week. It's an uphill fort siege where you're facing off against an evil necromancer who's shooting down powerful, magical fireballs at you from above, alongside his never-ending army of undead skelly archers. The challenging terrain alone would be a test of anyone's mettle in this tough, turn-based strategy game, especially when trying to parse all the different heights of its grid-based map. But having every enemy unit resurrect themselves after three turns unless you exorcise them with a single-use item or the lone Priest you've just recruited (who you may or may not have neglected to bring into battle with you) on top of all that? That smacks of the kind of late-game tomfoolery that more modern games of this ilk would normally save until their final acts. \nTactics Ogre: Reborn, on the other hand, likes to make its players sweat early. It was, after all, forged in the fires of the mid-90s SNES era, and looking back at old GameFAQ guides from 2010 (when it was remade for the PSP), it's clear this fight was just as much of a roadblock back in the day as it is now. Think of it as what yer lad Genichiro was to Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice - a hard, and often gruelling endurance test of everything you'd learned so far, but one that would ultimately set you up for the rest of the game upon claiming victory. I'm still not quite there yet, but having spent six hours noodling around the rest of Reborn's opening chapter, this granddaddy of Japanese strategy RPGs sure does hold up in the cold light of 2022.\nRead more",

          "description": "About three years after I graduated, I returned to the city where I went to University. Immediately after arriving, I embarked on an early-evening pilgrimage of sorts, my only goal to wander once familiar paths in an attempt to capture a spark of the life I no longer lived. As I ambled past houses that used to be homes, local haunts and darkened lecture halls, it was the differences that stood out the most. Pubs with names I didn’t recognise. Shops in locations that were more convenient than the ones I used to rely upon. Huge buildings that had seemingly sprung out of deserted scrubland. The city felt intimate yet alien. I was both a stranger and a local, a foreigner in a place I’d once adored.\r\n\n\r\nI was thinking about this experience a lot when I was invited to play a short hands-on demo of Capcom’s upcoming Resident Evil 4 remake. Here is a remake of my favourite game ever made, a title I have replayed countless times in the 17 years since its original debut, and all I can do is think about the little things. Tiny alterations that feel much larger when surrounded by something so immediately recognisable. This was the same Resident Evil 4 I’ve always known, but one that feels bigger, better and more dynamic. I left my session excited to play more, cautiously optimistic that Capcom may be in the process of crafting their best remake to date.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Those with a GeForce RTX graphics card could get some performance help, though, as the requirements’ notes say that meeting the recommended spec will allow for 4K resolution “using DLSS or similar technology”.

          "description": "As we reported earlier this week, alongside The Sims 4 officially becoming a free-to-play game, Maxis also gave a sneak peek of Project Rene, the next incarnation of the Sims franchise. We're all calling it The Sims 5, but the vagueness of the reveal means it could be some kind of... platform? MMO? And personally I think 4 being free-to-play means bets could be off on it being a new standalone. But what do I know? It's very early for Maxis to be showing it off, a point hammered home by VP of franchise creative Lyndsay Pearson as she talked about it. And the fact that it is so early makes it look even more like a bid to stop player eyes wandering over to newer pastures...\nRead more",

          "description": "Hello folks. Sorry to have to start another Letter From The Editor with an apology about how terribly late it is, but honestly, I'm not entirely sure where the time has gone. One minute it was June, and then suddenly... almost November!? I'm sorry everyone, truly. It has, in part, been another period of almost being able to announce some things, but also not quite. We're still working to get our proposed RPS Game Club off the ground, for example, but finding a good quality source of regular game keys for it has proven to be an elusive endeavour, to say the least. I'd imagine this will probably be a project for 2023 now (a delay, how quaint!), given how close we are to the end of the year, but I'll keep you posted as soon as we've got more to share on it.\nThings that are happening though, is the return of The RPS 100, which you may have seen us post about earlier in the week. This is our annual countdown of our favourite PC games of all time, as voted for by the RPS Treehouse. This year's list is quite different to the one we did last year - we do, after all, have pretty much a brand-new team in place now - and I'm looking forward to sharing that with you all next week. We even got our art team to make a special fancy header image for it this year and everything! Plus, if you were one of the people put out by our (accidental) glossing over of a certain immersive sim last year, you really won't want to miss it.\nRead more",

They were also fighting for their lives against thousands of bloodthirsty rats eager to devour them. These two have lived through more danger and trauma than anyone should have in a thousand lifetimes, and after the first game’s sort-of happy-ish ending, it got me thinking: when will these kids ever catch a break?\nTurns out the answer is never. Asobo’s follow-up A Plague Tale: Requiem is just as gory and bleak as its predecessor and as the siblings continue to battle through a violent world that wants them dead, they'll both face difficult moral decisions in the name of survival. Oh, and there are more rats. Like, a lot more rats.\nRead more",

It's got the perfect balance of roguelike hack-and-slash action and engaging community sim mechanics, all wrapped up in an adorably twisted art style. I can't speak for anyone else, but I honestly think Cult of the Lamb should be up as a Game of the Year contender, because it managed to blend some of our favorite gameplay mechanics to make one of the most unique titles we've seen in a while.

Announced this week via the below trailer (presented by Deadpool), it'll bring more characters into the fray.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blw2Q0YZI_E\nHere's what we have so far for the Midnight Suns season pass:\nDLC Content Pack 1 - Deadpool - A foulmouthed mercenary with a heart of gold, Deadpool has a penchant for grisly violence and lighthearted, fourth-wall breaking wisecracks.\nDLC Content Pack 2 - Venom - Spider-Man’s nemesis and one of the main game’s bosses, Venom turns playable hero in DLC #2, armed with all of the same symbiote attacks that once threatened the lives of the Midnight Suns.\nDLC Content Pack 3 - Morbius - One of the original comic book Midnight Sons, Morbius is an accomplished biochemist who, in an attempt to cure his own rare blood disease, turned himself into a living vampire.\nDLC Content Pack 4 - Storm - A powerful member of the X-Men, Storm has the ability to generate and manipulate wind, lightning, rain, and other types of weather to her will.\nYes, Deadpool makes a \"Morbin' Time\" joke in the video.\nAccording to 2K, the pass will also be sprinkled with additional content beyond the characters; like more levels and items. Midnight Suns is still slated for a December 2 release on PC, PS4, PS5, and Series X/S. The Switch version and prior generations are allegedly coming later, though there's no date in sight, and I wouldn't be surprised if they were canceled.\nAs one of the last big games of 2022 , I think I speak for strategy and Marvel enthusiasts alike when I say that I hope this one is worth it. With Firaxis at the helm it's really hard to go wrong, but putting big characters like this behind a season pass doesn't inspire confidence.\nThe post The Midnight Suns season pass will have a few heavy-hitting characters appeared first on Destructoid.",

Well, it's right around the corner, as we finally have the release date thanks to an IGN announcement. It'll debut on December 15, 2022, which lines up with a prior report from a producer for the game series, who likely let the release window slip.\nFurther tweets showed off character posters for the Sonic Prime Netflix show, which include:\nSonic\nTails\nKnuckles\nAmy\nEggman\nBig the Cat (and Froggy)\nShadow\nRouge\nAs someone on Twitter pointed out, the Sonic/main poster actually showcases a weird take on Amy: a potential multiversal roboticized version (just take a look at the crystal shard on Sonic's head). It's been a lonely time on the Sonic TV front, as the mostly well-received and canceled-too-soon-after-it-found-its-footing Sonic Boom has been gone for years now. Hopefully Prime will not only deliver, but keep going for more than a season.\nThrough good and bad adaptations, it's weird to me whenever there isn't a Sonic TV show of some sort around. As with anything with this series, in any medium, it really could go either way.

It's short and sweet.\nSo the first bit involves \"Naive Angel Mode,\" which, in the words of Platinum themselves, \"lowers the amount of violence and sexual content.\" Apparently the day one patch will apply this optional mode to \"more scenes,\" and it can be enabled immediately when starting the game (rather than on the chapter menu after the intro).\nAlso, the leaderboard/high score functionality is now properly applied before launch. There are numerous ways to upload your score: right after clearing a chapter and pressing \"+,\" or selecting a chapter manually on the chapter menu hub, selecting play history, and pressing \"+\" after the fact.\nOther than that, there's a generic \"game balance and other adjustments\" note, which could mean anything. You can find the patch notes below, courtesy of Nintendo Everything.\nBayonetta 3 patch 1.1.0 notes:\nGame Modes\nOnline\nGeneral\n\nThe post Bayonetta 3 launches with a very small day one patch appeared first on Destructoid.",

Bored of waiting for brothers Billy & Jimmy Lee to get the job done, Marian focused on honing her body, mind, and fighting abilities to ensure that if there was any future beatdowns to be dished out, she would be the one doin' the dishin'.\nMarian appeared in the original River City Girls as one of a number of cameo shopkeepers, but is finally strapping on the gauntlets to take to the street herself. Armed with an array of ground and pound grapples and haymaker strikes, this former abductee turned MMA monster is ready to help Kyoko, Misako, and her other allies in another adventure, (or should that be \"ABventure. God...DAMN), against the ruthless Sabu crime family.\nIf our heroes weren't tough enough before, then shit just got a whole lot tougher.\nRiver City Girls 2 will launch later this year on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms. Be sure to check out our previous write-ups on both River City Girls and River City Girls Zero, as well as our interviews with director Adam Tierney, and awesome composer Megan McDuffee.\nThe post Marian is done with damsel schtick in River City Girls 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

We will release an update soon to fix this issue. In the meantime, Rainmaker has been temporarily removed from Anarchy Battle. We apologize for the inconvenience.\"\n\nSo in short, as described by reliable dataminer OatmealDome, the actual bug involves a score counter reset if you touch a checkpoint. That's...instant-shutdown worthy for a competitive mode. Funnily enough I've seen some chatter in my circles that some folks seem to like it: as they didn't enjoy Rainmaker anyway, and are enjoying it being out of the rotation.\nWhile I'm still really enjoying Splatoon 3, it's been hit by multiplayer bugs since launch, including connection issues. That last patch had roughly 100 fixes, so it was bound to mess up something else. It's the Bethesda open world RPG patch effect! That's pretty much how every major Fallout 76 patch played out in the early days, with a minor patch afterward to smooth things out.\nThe post Nintendo pulled a Splatoon 3 mode because it found another bug appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Green(ish) Light\nMicrosoft has released its financial details for the first quarter of its fiscal year — While the statistics are something of a mixed bag, it has been a significant, positive season for the Xbox brand, with strong hardware sales leading to an overall revenue increase of around 11% year-on-year.\nThe continuing economic slump has been tough on Microsoft, which has seen a decline in many of its sectors. Revenue for operating software Windows dropped by a mighty 15%, while Xbox game sales were also down by a much more manageable 3%. The drop in game sales is likely due to the worldwide cost of living crisis, as well as an increased interest in subscription service Xbox Game Pass. Thus, even if Xbox game sales are down, there is something to be said for Game Pass' growth.\n\nMore positive news came in the form of the publisher's Intelligent Cloud server division, which saw a stellar year-on-year revenue increase of 20%. As previously mentioned, much of Xbox's decline was offset by the growing sales of Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S consoles. The sales of Xbox hardware and engagement with the Xbox Game Pass service — now boasting over 20 million subscribers — will clearly look to carry to load as Microsoft pushes through this continued downswing in customer spending.\nOf course, the more negative elements of the report are hardly about to bankrupt the company. Microsoft's overall revenue for the period still totals somewhere in the region of $50 billion USD, while its net income, even with a huge 14% drop, still saw the company pull in around $17.6 billion. MS is not going to be scratching for change anytime soon.\nIt should also be noted that the publisher recently laid off hundreds of employees across its entire workforce. Additionally, MS remains adamant in seeking approval for its $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard.\nThe post Microsoft revenue boosted as Xbox hardware sales offset income losses appeared first on Destructoid.",

There isn't much I can say about New Vegas that I haven't said already: it's a classic.\nThe rest of the lineup is decidedly less hard-hitting, but you might find something in there: Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Facility 47, WRC 9, Etherborn, Whispering Willows, and Last Day of June. Yes, it's that Indiana Jones game, from 1989. It's not the film, and it's not anything recent. I had to do a double take on that one. Wildly, there were three core iterations of game adaptations for Last Crusade: a PC action game, a classic PC adventure title (the Prime Gaming one), and a console platformer.\nAll of these will be available starting November 1.

Last year I dedicated four weeks of my column to be about storytelling in games that also related to Halloween, but it turns out that's a pretty niche topic to keep coming up with ideas for over and over. This year I've instead resigned myself to watching and playing as many Halloween related movies and games as I can, and I have to say that plan has done a tremendous job of getting me in the spirit of the season.\nThere are a few games I come back to every year, chief among them being Until Dawn.

Likewise, the game's Switch port is technically much, much worse than anyone would have expected.  When it comes to stuff like polygon count, pop-up, frame rate, and just a general sense of jank, this is one of the least polished-looking modern games from a AAA studio I've ever seen.

In a new blog, BioWare confirms Dragon Age: Dreadwolf has completed the Alpha milestone.\nWhat this means, effectively, is that Dreadwolf is currently playable from start to finish. This doesn't mean the work's done quite yet, though.\nIn a new blog, BioWare general manager Gary McKay says the team is now looking at the narrative cohesion.\n\"We can take the story we’ve written and see if we’re expressing it well through the characters, dialogue, cinematics, and ultimately, the player’s journey,\" said McKay. \"Now that we have the ability to do a complete playthrough, we can iterate and polish on the things that matter most to our fans.\"\nDragon Age: Dreadwolf is heading to a few new locales. Notably, this includes one fans have heard about more than a few times: the Tevinter Imperium. Today's blog confirms players will visit Minrathous, the heart of the Tevinter empire.\nMcKay continues on to say that the Dreadwolf team wants to \"continue being transparent\" with fans about development, and keep people up-to-date. So far, the studio has released a few development updates this year. One slapped the official subtitle on Dreadwolf. And another teased some codex entries that are in store.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw3lrXlti-8\nThe Dreadwolf rises\nThe next installment of Dragon Age was first teased at The Game Awards in 2018. Since then, BioWare's been working on it, going through some big shifts in the process.\nWhile we've seen some teases, we've still had yet to see a full look at what's in store for the Dragon Age universe. Hopefully, with such a big milestone passed, BioWare will cast more light on the Dread Wolf's plans soon.\nThe post Dragon Age: Dreadwolf has passed its alpha milestone appeared first on Destructoid.",

The new remaster has an expected Japanese launch date of March 2023.\nR-Type Final 3 Evolved — revealed in the latest issue of Japanese publication Famitsu — is a revamped edition of the 2021 release R-Type Final 2, making the initial title of that game even more ironic than it already was. While details are incredibly slim at this stage, Famitsu reports that Final 3 Evolved will feature improved visuals, online multiplayer lobbies, a selection of mini-games, and an impressive 100 total ships as well as seven all-new stages, making this one of the most feature-packed releases in the iconic Irem franchise.\nIn addition, Final 3 Evolved will utilize support for the upcoming PSVR2 hardware, allowing players to be immersed in The Bydo Empire battle like never before. I personally cannot wait until the famous boss character Dobkeratops is quite literally assaulting my eyeballs with their eyeballs. While no western localization was announced, such a release remains highly likely, given the appearance of previous titles on North American and European shores.

          "description": "The image posting tool was removed this week\nThe 3DS and Wii U image posting tool was removed: which itself seems insignificant, but actually highlights the slow, and at times, absurd deaths of the systems.\nThe news comes straight from Nintendo's Japanese customer service Twitter account, which states (translated): \"Nintendo 3DS series and Wii U 'image posting tool' service ended today at 4:00 pm. Images from the Nintendo 3DS series and Wii U cannot be posted after. Images and comments posted on Facebook and Twitter can be viewed on each SNS even after the service ends.\" The official end time was October 25 at 4PM JST. So it's over!\nAs you may recall, both of these devices are on the way out, and are being completely disconnected from pretty much every service by 2023. Most of their online functionality was already ripped away, as we move toward the \"March 2023\" full end date when everything is gone.\nIt's a shame. I get that legacy devices do need to end service at some point. But it's funny to boot up some really old devices, and just....game on PC...and see a ton of online functionality alive and well, like nothing changed. I love the Wii U and 3DS to pieces, but the latter in particular has an incredible legacy that Nintendo should forever be proud of. I wish it could live on past March 2023.\nThe post The 3DS and Wii U continue to die a slow death appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Fool's Theory will remake the first Witcher game\nCD Projekt has revealed one of their previously teased projects as a full-fledged remake of the first The Witcher game.\nThe remake, previously dubbed Project Canis Majoris, is in the early stages of development at Fool's Theory, a third-party studio. The team is working on the remake in Unreal Engine 5, with creative supervision from CD Projekt Red, and is using the same tool set as the new Witcher trilogy that's in the works.\nFool's Theory was formed in 2015 by former Witcher developers, so it's a bit of a natural fit. CD Projekt Red head Adam Badowski said the team at Fool's Theory knows the source material well, and how to make \"incredible and ambitious\" games.\n\"The Witcher is where it all started for us, for CD Projekt Red,\" said Badowski. \"It was the first game we made, ever, and it was a big moment for us then. Going back to this place and remaking the game for the next generation of gamers to experience it feels just as big, if not bigger.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3EF-71dodo\nReturn to the source\nThe first The Witcher game stretches back pretty far, first launching in 2007 for the PC. Having personally played a chunk of it, it certainly has some cool ideas, but isn't really the series that it would grow into with its sequels.\nA rermake of the original certainly seems like an intriguing prospect. No more details were shared today on when this might arrive. But hearing it will also utilize the tools for the next Witcher trilogy is interesting.\nThere's more in development at CD Projekt, too. The aforementioned new trilogy for The Witcher is one part, as is a new Witcher project from The Molasses Flood. And on the more futuristic side of things, CD Projekt is also working on the follow-up to Cyberpunk 2077.\nThe post CD Projekt announces a remake of The Witcher built in Unreal Engine 5 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Some new areas, and some old too\nOwlcat Games is planning on more Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous content. Today, the studio laid out its plans for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous' Season 2 Pass, which will have three new pieces of DLC for the RPG.\nIn a video today, creative director Alexander Mishulin discusses the upcoming DLC. Owlcat put a survey in the field, and the studio says it got over 30,000 responses on what players want from more Wrath of the Righteous.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-fkebaHP9g\nThe result? This set of three DLC, currently labelled DLC 4, 5, and 6. Here's the rundown of each.\nPathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous Season 2 Pass DLC\nDLC #4: A new companion joins the party, showcasing the new playable class for the DLC: the ever-changing Shifter. They're physical brawlers who take on bestial aspects. New love may even await.\nDLC #5: A standalone campaign that picks up from where Through the Ashes, a previous self-contained mini-campaign, left off. It offers a six-to-seven hour independent campaign, featuring a regular group of adventurers. And once you're done, a whole new dungeon in the main campaign will be available to explore.\nDLC #6: The Knight Commander and crew return to Kenabres for some unfinished business: actual rest and relaxation. A new festival is in the works, and there's plenty of opportunities to hang out with companions and your loved one. Though, you might want to keep an eye out for secret developments.\nThe Season 2 Pass for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous will go for $29.99, and is available to pre-order for PC players now. It doesn't look like a release plan has been set out yet for the new content.\nOwlcat's Wrath of the Righteous recently launched onto consoles, which also upgraded the PC version to the Enhanced Edition. And even with another RPG in the oven, it's nice to see Owlcat continuing to bulk out an already sizable RPG offering.\nThe post Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous Season Pass 2 plans detailed appeared first on Destructoid.",

To my surprise, this month saw the release of a game that fits both of these criteria: Marvel Snap.

As you play, you collect cards adorned with Marvel characters, each with a unique ability.

The game centers on a rural family – a father, mother, and child – whose lives get turned upside down by a cataclysmic event involving extraterrestrial visitors. The journey unfolds as a side-scrolling adventure game where the family must survive this apocalypse as it rips through small towns and beyond. You can watch the most recent trailer below.\n\n\nSomerville was first unveiled during E3 2021 and most recently popped up during last December's Game Awards. The game will be available on Xbox consoles (including Game Pass) and PC.",

          "description": "Rieko Kodama, the pioneering Sega developer behind titles like Phantasy Star and Skies of Arcadia, has died at 58. \nNick Thorpe, features editor for Retro Gaming Magazine, noticed that in the credits for Sega's Mega Drive Mini II, there's a message that reads, \"In memory of Rieko Kodama.\" Twitter user Ares Arcadia quote-tweeted Thorpe's tweet to ask Sega producer Yosuke Okunari if this message means that Kodama had died to which Okunari replied and said, \"As you understand it. We respected her,\" confirming her death. \nSega has since confirmed Kodama's death, citing that she had passed in May, according to IGN. Further details around her death will not be shared out of respect for her family's privacy, Sega says. \n\"We pray that the deceased will rest in peace, and we offer our gratitude for her enormous contributions to Sega,\" Sega of Japan says, as translated by IGN Japan. \nKodama's journey through game development began in the 1980s when she started as a graphic designer for Master System and Sega Genesis games like Altered Beast and Sonic the Hedgehog. She was the main artist for Phantasy Star and continued to work on the series' visuals team until Phantasy Star IV: The End of the Millennium, which she directed.\nOther credits include Mega Drive versions of Sorcerian, Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, and more. After directing Phantasy Star IV, she directed Magic Knight Rayearth in 1995 before becoming a producer and development lead on Sega's Skies of Arcadia. She continued to work in games development in some capacity until at least 2018, where she was the lead producer on the Sega compilation title Sega Ages. \nIn 2019, she was recognized with the Pioneer Award at GDC 2019. \nThe staff at Game Informer extends their condolences to Kodama's family.",

Spawned in 2007 by Capcom veterans, including Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami and Devil May Cry and Okami mastermind Hideki Kamiya, the studio became a haven for these minds to create new franchises under the freedom of independence. Early success like MadWorld turned heads, but Platinum’s third title, Bayonetta, cemented it as one of the game industry’s premier action studios.\nLaunching in Japan in 2009 and hitting U.S. shores in 2010, Bayonetta revamped and, in some ways, improved the stylish action of its spiritual predecessor, Devil May Cry. The bewitching adventure reinvented and reinvigorated the stylish action genre; Platinum created its magnum opus in only two years. Unfortunately, sales didn’t match the reception, and Sega, the game’s original publisher, passed on a sequel. Despite fans’ cries, Bayonetta seemingly ended the series before it could take off.\nNintendo stepped up to answer those pleas by agreeing to publish a follow-up. Bayonetta 2 arrived in 2014 as a Wii U exclusive. The sequel proved Bayonetta wasn’t a one-hit wonder, becoming one of the year’s best games with some fans believing it surpassed its predecessor. The success also proved the family-friendly Nintendo had no problem letting the franchise remain true to its Mature-rated self.\nRead more...",

You can also catch up on previous episodes by visiting our new Game Informer Shows YouTube channel or watching the embedded video below. \nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. \n\n\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, as I revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure.

          "description": "Warner Bros. Games has announced Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, a mobile-exclusive Mortal Kombat experience. The game is described as a collection role-playing game where players build a roster of fighters from the Mortal Kombat universe and “unleash them in massive real-time group battles.” It’s more than just battles, though – Onslaught is also said to feature a cinematic story experience where fighters have to defeat a “dark and dangerous threat.”\nThis is not the first time Mortal Kombat has appeared on a mobile device. Mortal Kombat Mobile was released in 2015 alongside Mortal Kombat X and eventually adapted characters and features from Mortal Kombat 11 as well. Mortal Kombat Mobile has been downloaded over 150 million times since its launch, so it’s no wonder WB Games wants to release more games from the franchise.\nOctober 8 marked the series’ 30th anniversary, and Mortal Kombat: Onslaught seems to be a celebration of that. Not only is it the newest mobile game in the series, but it’s also the most recent title since the release of Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate in 2020. As far as the future of the series is concerned outside of the mobile market, Netherrealm has been pretty quiet lately. Outside of our interview with franchise co-creator Ed Boon where he said we'd have to wait a little longer, the most recent news we’ve received has been this tweet:\nPatiently waiting for news on NRS’s next game…. pic.twitter.com/1ulQHZhnKx\nOctober 15, 2022\nMortal Kombat: Onslaught is coming out sometime in 2023.

However, I’m still journeying through Mario’s latest tactical crossover, so I’m not ready to give a full verdict as of yet.

It retains the core strategic gameplay of the original, so if you liked the first game, you’ll probably enjoy this as well. Removing the grid and having freedom of movement feels liberating, however, and is one of the big game-changers. It's interesting because this doesn't change my approach to playing a turn-based tactics game.

The most persistent is that Bloober Team, creators of The Medium and Layers of Fear, is remaking Silent Hill 2. Late September, it was reported that a title called Silent Hill: The Short Message had been rated in South Korea. \nThe last full-fledged Silent Hill game was 2012’s ill-recieved Book of Memories for PS Vita.

The presentation featured an extended guided walkthrough showing off new gameplay footage as well as a rundown of features designed to make the game more terrifying than ever. \nThe video’s side-by-side comparisons illustrate the major differences between the original and the remake. One big change is that the Ishimura is now a seamless, interconnected ship that players can explore more freely. For example, using Isaac’s rocket thrusters to soar through areas you could only walk through before. A new system called the Intensity Spawn Director remixes necromorph spawn points, ensuring they’ll ambush veteran players in unexpected ways and, sometimes, in greater numbers. Dead Space also features improved necromorph dismemberment, new side quests designed to flesh out the supporting cast, new alternate fire modes for weapons, new puzzles, and more. \n\n\nDead Space launches on January 27 for PlayStation5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

          "description": "In a new trailer, the Pokémon Company and Nintendo unveiled the mystery Pokémon teased in a video earlier this week. Their name is Bellibolt, and they’re the signature partner of Iono, the newest gym leader from Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.\n\n\nIn Wednesday’s initial video, Iono introduced herself as not just a gym leader but also a streamer. She then asked her fictional followers to guess what her mystery partner Pokémon was based on a handful of details, including its type, the placement of its eyes, and the fact that it’s “so cute.” If you had trouble guessing, don't feel bad; today, we’ve learned that her partner is a new Pokémon altogether.\nNintendo and The Pokémon Company released a series of follow-up tweets, giving us new information about Bellibolt that sounds like it was pulled right from the Pokédex. One of the images reveals that they have a new ability called \"Electromorphosis,\" which allows Bellibolt to power up their next electric-type move after being hit by an attack.\nSay hello to the new EleFrog Pokémon, Bellibolt!\n#PokemonScarletViolet\nhttps://t.co/z7lNKThsDX pic.twitter.com/EUdcQcsUoA\nOctober 14, 2022\nYou'll be able to add Bellibolt to your team when Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet come to switch on November 18. If you want more Pokémon content before that, check out this extended gameplay demo from last week, the reveal of different new Pokémon, or our preview from earlier this year.",

          "description": "Star Trek: Resurgence is the latest title to get pushed into 2023. The narrative-driven sci-fi adventure will now launch in April to ensure it receives a final coat of polish.\nDeveloper Dramatic Labs announced the news on Twitter, stating it’s taking the extra time to ensure “a truly immersive Star Trek experience”. You can read the full statement below (click the image to enlarge).\nResurgence was first announced during The Game Awards 2021 and is a choice-driven adventure game that follows a similar design template to Telltale Games’ titles (Dramatic Labs consists of ex-Telltale employees). The story unfolds shortly after the events of Star Trek: The Next Generation as players control two original characters, an officer and a commander, to solve a mystery aboard the U.S.S. Resolute. The narrative and your relationships change depending on your choices, and gameplay features light combat and puzzle-solving. Resurgence is currently slated to launch on PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. \nWe played a demo of Star Trek: Resurgence during Summer Game Fest in June, and you can read our hands-on impressions here. You can also keep up with the plethora of big titles that have been delayed to 2023 by checking out this list.",
