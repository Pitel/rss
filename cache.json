Now, we've got a reason to go back, as the developer announced that a brand new update has dropped for the game.\nIt's a beefy update too, and the first one for Switch, with the two major headlines being Trait Enhancement and the reduction of RNG.

          "description": "About three years after I graduated, I returned to the city where I went to University. Immediately after arriving, I embarked on an early-evening pilgrimage of sorts, my only goal to wander once familiar paths in an attempt to capture a spark of the life I no longer lived. As I ambled past houses that used to be homes, local haunts and darkened lecture halls, it was the differences that stood out the most. Pubs with names I didn’t recognise. Shops in locations that were more convenient than the ones I used to rely upon. Huge buildings that had seemingly sprung out of deserted scrubland. The city felt intimate yet alien. I was both a stranger and a local, a foreigner in a place I’d once adored.\r\n\n\r\nI was thinking about this experience a lot when I was invited to play a short hands-on demo of Capcom’s upcoming Resident Evil 4 remake. Here is a remake of my favourite game ever made, a title I have replayed countless times in the 17 years since its original debut, and all I can do is think about the little things. Tiny alterations that feel much larger when surrounded by something so immediately recognisable. This was the same Resident Evil 4 I’ve always known, but one that feels bigger, better and more dynamic. I left my session excited to play more, cautiously optimistic that Capcom may be in the process of crafting their best remake to date.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Those with a GeForce RTX graphics card could get some performance help, though, as the requirements’ notes say that meeting the recommended spec will allow for 4K resolution “using DLSS or similar technology”. That’s not quite a formal confirmation of Nvidia DLSS support, but strongly indicates it, maybe along with similar upscaling systems like AMD FSR or Intel XeSS.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Sorry to have to start another Letter From The Editor with an apology about how terribly late it is, but honestly, I'm not entirely sure where the time has gone. One minute it was June, and then suddenly... almost November!? I'm sorry everyone, truly. It has, in part, been another period of almost being able to announce some things, but also not quite. We're still working to get our proposed RPS Game Club off the ground, for example, but finding a good quality source of regular game keys for it has proven to be an elusive endeavour, to say the least. I'd imagine this will probably be a project for 2023 now (a delay, how quaint!), given how close we are to the end of the year, but I'll keep you posted as soon as we've got more to share on it.\nThings that are happening though, is the return of The RPS 100, which you may have seen us post about earlier in the week. This is our annual countdown of our favourite PC games of all time, as voted for by the RPS Treehouse. This year's list is quite different to the one we did last year - we do, after all, have pretty much a brand-new team in place now - and I'm looking forward to sharing that with you all next week. We even got our art team to make a special fancy header image for it this year and everything! Plus, if you were one of the people put out by our (accidental) glossing over of a certain immersive sim last year, you really won't want to miss it.\nRead more",

They were also fighting for their lives against thousands of bloodthirsty rats eager to devour them. These two have lived through more danger and trauma than anyone should have in a thousand lifetimes, and after the first game’s sort-of happy-ish ending, it got me thinking: when will these kids ever catch a break?\nTurns out the answer is never. Asobo’s follow-up A Plague Tale: Requiem is just as gory and bleak as its predecessor and as the siblings continue to battle through a violent world that wants them dead, they'll both face difficult moral decisions in the name of survival. Oh, and there are more rats. Like, a lot more rats.\nRead more",

It’s very much your typical British town, replete with shops, restaurants, and many, many double yellow lines. That’s why it’s pretty astonishing to see a section of Guildford recreated on a distant world in sci-fi exploration sim No Man’s Sky. Why Guildford though? Well, it's because devs Hello Games are based there. Their office and the surrounding streets have been constructed in-game by No Man’s Sky player Joan, a.k.a. Rasdar07, and shared in the base building chat on the game’s Discord server.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Sure, it looked gorgeous on a big TV, its bright colours popping all over your living room, but it always felt bit wrong to me. I think it's all about pacing. Persona 5's blend of turn-based combat and life sim elements hardly moves at a breakneck speed. There's a lot of reading. A lot of listening to your pals chat about their hopes and fears. A lot of pressing one button to progress a line of dialogue onto the next. Shoving that on your 65\" 4K TV always seemed a bit overkill.\r\n\n\r\nBasically, I never got into Persona 5 when it first launched on PS4. I played about three hours of it and then binned it off in favour of something else. In 2020, during a moment of first-lockdown madness, I bought Persona 5 Royal for full price, thinking maybe my issue with the original release was that there wasn't enough of it, but surprisingly discovered it still wasn't for me. At this point, I'd invested £100 into my \"Do I like Persona 5?\" experiment and was quickly realising the result was a pretty firm \"No, mate, you don't\". So when I sat down with the PC version of the game on the Steam Deck to test it out, I figured I'd play it for a few hours and then never touch it again. I was wrong. I was so very wrong.\n\n \nRead more",

Since its updated and expanded Royal version dropped on PlayStation some years later, I've been afraid to make my return. You'd think I'd be itching to delve back into what's essentially the definitive version of the Phantom Thieves' adventure, and yet it's precisely because it blew me away the first time that I've been reluctant to go back.\nNow? Now I feel silly. After playing the early portions of Persona 5: Royal, which finds itself coming to practically every remaining platform this week, including PC, my goodness me, it's wonderful to be back in Shibuya with the gang.

          "description": "In a bizarre twist to Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 40 series GPU rollout, it turns out there will be no 12GB version of the RTX 4080 at all. Nvidia announced an \"unlaunch\" of the graphics card, which would have sat below the RTX 4080 16GB and the RTX 4090, effectively cancelling it. The 16GB version will still release as planned on November 16th.\r\n\n\r\n\"The RTX 4080 12GB is a fantastic graphics card, but it’s not named right\", reads Nvidia’s statement. \"Having two GPUs with the 4080 designation is confusing. So, we’re pressing the \"unlaunch\" button on the 4080 12GB.\" \r\n\n \nRead more",

Unfortunately, while on a deep sea dive to retrieve the tapes of episodes 13 and 14 (an expedition funded by supporters; your generosity is always appreciated), my ship was attacked by a large and unusually toothsome whale-like creature. The cursed thing took a huge bite out of the side of our noble vessel, The Squiggled Egg, and we were forced to abandon ship. It was only by the grace of the botswain Hughbert Threads that I'm alive to write this post today, as the man gave his life beating back the foul beast, giving a large part of the rest of the crew time to get away. Alas, in the confusion, I only secured episode 14, and episode 13 is now lost to time. That is definitely what happened, and not that the digital recording got mangled somehow.\nStill, episode 14 (which is now episode 13, even though I say 14 in the recording) is now here for you to enjoy. It's all about bad and obsolete palaeontology - the weird ways people in history interpreted fossils, and why.\nRead more",

          "description": "You know what's quite lovely if you can afford it? Having a truly massive hard drive or SSD. Back in the day, I was over the moon when I picked up a 750MB drive for my gaming PC - I could do a full install of Civilization 2! And have room left over for X-Wing Alliance! These days, PC storage offers slightly larger capacities, but the thrill of having a really giant drive remains as strong as ever.\nThat brings me to the subject of today's deal post: the Crucial P3, a 4TB (!) NVMe drive capable of 3500MB/s sequential reads, is down to £299.99 at Amazon. That's a £90 reduction from its usual price, and an incredible deal for one of the biggest NVMe SSDs on the market. \nRead more",

Best avoid it and this review if you have issues with body horror themes.\nI was talking to a friend about Scorn and they asked, \"Is there a story?\". And yeah, Scorn has a story. At some point there'll be a two hour YouTube video outlining how it has a clear and nuanced plot, or that it's a metaphor for periods and erections, or both. In the immediate, it's about slithering out of a pod, staggering through the desert, and finding yourself in a strange, huge rotting machine made of rock and flesh that's already decades into abandonment and decay, and where most things look a bit penisy or womby. It's about the lizardy parasite latched to your back gradually transforming your body. It's about grim squishy noises and survival.\nScorn doesn't have dialogue, or a map. It doesn't really have a HUD, it doesn't have quest markers, and your character will not, upon seeing a strange new device, say something like \"Hmm... seems like a key. Maybe if I find the two missing ones, it'll open up a way forward!\" out loud. It won't even pull focus to the corridor you should check next. You just have to look around, experiment, and figure it out. I think I like it. I don't know if I can recommend it.\nRead more",

          "description": "The Ryzen 7 5800X was a great gaming CPU when it launched in 2020, and it remains one of the fastest options going despite the recent release of Ryzen 7000 processors late last month. The 5800X also has two major advantages: it works on a wide range of cheap motherboards with DDR4 RAM, and it's way cheaper than the 7700X - especially when it's discounted on Ebay US, as is the case today!\nSo: let's cut to the chase. The 5800X is down to $229.99 at Ebay, from a list price of $449, meaning it's nearly 50% off. That also makes it $170 cheaper than the equivalent Ryzen 7000 processor, the $400 eight-core Ryzen 7700X. Or, to put it another way, you're paying around 60% of the price for at least 80% of the gaming performance of that newer CPU - not bad, given that you'll also pay way less for a complete Ryzen 5000 system (with AM4 motherboards and DDR4) than a complete Ryzen 7000 one (with AM5 motherboards and DDR5). \nRead more",

A terrible crime will sit at the heart of them, yes, but most take place in the days and weeks that follow, where the bulk of your time is spent gathering clues and building a case to work out whodunnit. Rarely do you get to glimpse the immediate aftermath of the crime itself, where all the major suspects are still in play and their pockets are stuffed with incriminating evidence they'll no doubt be disposing of in the coming minutes. \nThe prime exception to this rule is Lucas Pope's Return Of The Obra Dinn, which gives you a time-travelling pocket watch to revisit the scenes of its many, many murders and work out exactly what happened to its 60-strong passenger list on its titular, ill-fated ship. Frogwares' Sherlock Holmes games and their mind palace visualisation techniques also warrant a mention here, and maybe even Outer Wilds at a push, if you count its 22-minute timeloop as an investigation scene several millennia in the making. But it's Obra Dinn that Color Gray Games emulate most strongly with their impressive debut in The Case Of The Golden Idol, which gives you a series of 12 murders to solve, each of which is presented as a freeze-frame vignette at the moment of death. You're still filling in blanks here, slotting names, objects and eventually verbs in its various scene scrolls to deduce whodunnit and howtheydunit, but this intriguing tale of 18th century high (and a secret) society, betrayals, backstabbing and murder most foul is a mystery game for the ages. \nRead more",

They actually resemble the patterns of the t-shirts that will appear in-game, which is a nice touch.\nA \"Collaboration Festival\" is also underway at Pokemon Centers \"nationwide\" (again, in Japan), where you can pick up tie-in stickers (featuring the key art for the event). Curiously, some centers also have \"polling stations,\" which include \"voting stickers\" for each choice.\nAs a reminder, everything will kick off on November 11 at 4PM PT, through November 13 at that same time. The Pokemon Center tie-ins begin on October 21, and will run through November 13 (or, as Nintendo points out, as long as supplies last).\nHere's a list of the Japanese locations hosting Pokemon Splatfest events:\nBic Camera Sapporo (Hokkaido)\nBic Camera Yurakucho (Tokyo)\nYodobashi Camera Multimedia Akiba (Tokyo)\nBic Camera Lazona Kawasaki (Kanagawa)\nYodobashi Camera Multimedia Yokohama (Kanagawa)\nYodobashi Camera Multimedia Umeda (Osaka)\nYodobashi Camera Multimedia Hakata (Fukuoka)\n\"All Pokemon Center stores\"\n[Update: The US My Nintendo site has been updated, and confirms that the trio of keychains are \"coming soon\" to the US side.]\nThe post Japan is going all-out for Splatoon 3’s upcoming Pokemon Splatfest (Update) appeared first on Destructoid.",

The two titles will be available to subscribers from November 2.\nDeveloped by Hudson Soft and released in 1999 and 2000 respectively, Mario Party and Mario Party 2 were Nintendo's hugely successful efforts to transpose the beloved Super Mario Bros. universe to a \"tabletop\" format, with players chasing each other around a digital board game, and battling it out in fun, short, silly, and simplistic mini-games.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meP0WTgUJcE\nFocusing on basic controls, easy-to-learn rules, and fast action, Mario Party can be seen as one of Nintendo's earliest forays into the \"anyone can play\" demography. This inclusive view of the family gaming audience would lead to the development and staggering success of the Nintendo Wii platform.\nSince those halcyon years, the franchise has continued on successive platforms including the Gamecube, Nintendo Wii, and, most recently, the Nintendo Switch in the form of 2021's Mario Party Superstars. While the visuals and creativity have obviously progressed with each and every entry, the series has never lost sight of its inclusive nature, still offering pick-up-and-play fun for both dedicated video game fans, and visiting holiday relatives. With these Nintendo Switch Online re-releases, series fans who missed out on the franchise's formative days can jump back into the action all over again.\nBagsy Peach.\nMario Party and Mario Party 2 join the Nintendo Switch Online archives on November 2.\nThe post Mario Party and Mario Party 2 join Nintendo Switch Online next month appeared first on Destructoid.",

It was exciting to get to see his rework with Overwatch 2, but fans were remiss to see that Bastion, along with the engineer hero Torbjorn, had been taken off of the roster of playable characters for the forseeable future. No need to worry, though — they were only disabled temporarily while Blizzard makes some tweaks to the heroes. This makes perfect sense, considering Bastion and Torb are two of the characters that have been reworked the most since the first game's launch all the way back in 2016, along with others like Mercy, Hanzo, and D.va.\nAfter a few weeks of wondering when we might…",

A few enemies even make it in too, and I'm a big fan of the mummy Blooper: give me that toy. The wallpaper is zero Platinum Points and fully digital.\nBeyond that, Nintendo also has a \"spooky pumpkin-carving stencil\" for Splatoon 3, and reminds folks that they have a host of physical rewards currently up on My Nintendo. At the time of writing, newer restocks include the Metroid Dread poster set, as well as a Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope keychain.\nAs a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.\nThe post This new official Nintendo Halloween wallpaper is adorable appeared first on Destructoid.",

Odd, that. Famously resource-hungry upon their initial PC release, the titles are well known for their dynamic action, dazzling visuals, and groundbreaking special effects. Of course, this trinity of remasters only serves to add further polish to all three games, with improved lighting and weather effects, high-resolution textures, and visual enhancements to the in-game models.\nIf you never got around to experiencing this exciting series of actioners, (perhaps your 486 DX 2 wasn't up to the task), then this release could prove the perfect opportunity to check them out. Steam will be launching the trilogy at a discounted price for the first week of release, with a pretty chunky 40% off of the asking price. In addition, players who already own the original Crysis Remastered on Steam will earn further discount, allowing them to round out the collection for not too many dollarydoos.\nCrysis Remastered Trilogy launches on Steam November 17. It is available right now on PS4, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Epic Games Store.\nThe post Crysis Remastered Trilogy blows up on Steam November 17 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Another really interesting story comes from Grancola1920, who mentioned in the comments that they \"recently ran into a bug with '???' after 700+ hours and it flew away before [they] could catch it. Now [they're] on a Hyrule wide bug hunt.\" It's amazing that stories like these can still come out of this game, even if a lot of folks have moved on.\nBut what about the missed connections, or abandoned quests?\nFor me, it's the Zelda: Breath of the Wild Korok Seeds\nI know! I 100%ed the game otherwise (all items that I know of/shrines): everything except the Korok Seeds. I was going to do it (and made good progress before guides were invented!), but once I saw the reward, I just couldn't go through with it.\nGrowing up, I always had a certain degree of satisfaction 100%ing games. Not every game was \"worthy\" of it, in that sense, but the ones I really connected to, I did go for it. But the real cherry on top of that sometimes grueling walk to that sundae was the reward. In character action games, it was occasionally a new costume or some insane toggle that fundamentally transformed the game in some way. That's enough for me.\nBut 900 Zelda: Breath of the Wild Korok Seeds with no real reward?

Unlike some other modern games that have made their way to Nintendo's handheld recently, Alan Wake Remastered is not a cloud app, but seems to run right off the Switch hardware.\nThe writer will go portable\nIt's an impressive feat, and makes me a bit interested to see how the remaster holds up on Switch. Alan Wake Remastered was no visual slouch when it first released for other platforms.\nThat said, developers have been working some real technical magic with the Nintendo Switch lately. Just look at ports like NieR: Automata's Switch version. As the years have gone on, it's impressive what some have accomplished.\nWe'll see if Alan Wake Remastered also stands up as a port, but as a game, it's certainly held its following. Heck, it's well-liked enough to even be tied into Remedy's Control, and get a sequel greenlit for development.\nThis story of a writer fighting the dark with a flashlight seems to still hold sway.

Speaking in a short promo reel, which you can check out below, Gans revealed that the new film will be based upon the plot of 2001 game Silent Hill 2 — which is itself a fan favorite among the franchise's dedicated community.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_FOVN-UkEI\n\"This return is my return to a world, a universe I touched in 2006... 15 years ago,\" recalls Gans in the clip. \"The film was a great success and we decided to go back to the best of these stories.... Silent Hill 2. The film tells the story of a young guy coming back to Silent Hill, where he has known a great love [but] what he's going to find is a pure nightmare.\"\nKonami also took the opportunity to officially announce a remake of Silent Hill 2 itself, which will be headed up by the horror gaming heads of Bloober Team. In fact, it was also suggested that Return to Silent Hill is something of a catalyst for the various incoming gaming efforts, with Konami hoping that the new film will inspire players to dive back into the digital fog of the cursed town.\nReturn to Silent Hill will begin shooting in early 2023.\nThe post Return to Silent Hill is a new sequel to the cult 2006 movie appeared first on Destructoid.",

Beyond the inaugural clip that reminded us where Fallout came from, we're immediately moving into the Bethesda era.\nYou can watch the first episode here, but we'll go over the gist of the additional episodes that dropped this week below.\nFallout Retrospective: A New Generation\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8APJIukXySU\nIn A New Generation, the team talks about showing off Fallout 3 to Tim Cain, a creator of the franchise: and how Bethesda was able to move into the \"next generation\" of Fallout\nFallout Retrospective: How to Reveal a Fallout Live\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSePOZU2WsQ\nAs we move into the more polarizing parts of the series' history, this video features Todd Howard, and his role in presenting Fallout games to the world (and how he had the idea to do one giant presentation instead of multiple ones per game). We also get some talk about the pressure to succeed from Fallout 3 to Fallout 4.\nNo matter how some of these entries turn out, you can't really deny that Bethesda is one of the best in the business in terms of promising early gameplay.\nFallout Retrospective: The Great Green Debate\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vnznzZFd_g\nIn one of the more interesting videos so far, Bethesda defends its \"green color palette\" in games, and talks about the \"right\" colors for the series. The team recounts \"endless discussions about the color green.\"\nThe main point they hit is the need to really get it right for the Pip Boy UI, as the player is going to be looking at it constantly over the course of the game.\nThe post The official Fallout retrospective just posted more episodes appeared first on Destructoid.",

You're looking for Splatoon Inkling (Yellow), Octoling (Blue), and Smallfry. The packaging for the new Splatoon 3 run includes black, blue, and yellow coloring. Amiibo News is reporting that they could go in stock at Amazon imminently.\nCurrently, the release date is still officially November 11. All three will arrive on that date, and will provide costume bonuses, like other key amiibo released so far for the series. You'll also be able to take pictures with the figures for your own enjoyment. So you're not missing a ton by forgoing this round of figurines: which is par for the course for a lot of amiibo releases these past few years. That said, I fully expect the new idol trio will be on sale at some point.\nOnce these three are released in November, we’ll have the following announced amiibo remaining:\nSuper Smash Bros.

In much the same way that Monster Hunter World reminded video game fans at large what Monster World was, DmC5 reintroduced, (and in some cases, introduced), Dante and his sexy pals to a new audience of players on a global basis.\nIn fact, some would argue that DmC5 was one of the key titles that kicked off Capcom's latter-day renaissance, which has seen the legendary developer go from strength to strength with smash releases such as Monster Hunter World, Monster Hunter Rise, Resident Evil: Village, the Resident Evil remakes, Capcom Arcade Stadium, and the upcoming Street Fighter 6. In the fall of 2020, Capcom would release DmC5 for then-new platforms PS5 and Xbox Series X, in the form of Devil May Cry 5: Special Edition.\nDevil May Cry 5 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nhttps://twitter.com/DevilMayCry/status/1582748663801335808?s=20&t=1xblAg-uet1GGzJ-_bjWsA\nThe post Devil May Cry 5 smashes past six million Super Sexy Sales appeared first on Destructoid.",

Square Enix surprise-dropped The World Ends With You's follow-up on Steam today, October 19.\nOriginally released in 2021, NEO: The World Ends With You first hit PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch. It later arrived on PC, though only through the Epic Games Store.\nThis Steam release brings the pin-slamming action onto Steam's platform, for anyone who wants it specifically on that storefront. It's going for $59.99, though as of this writing it has a 25% launch discount running until October 25.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvZquGt-XDA\nPicking this version up will net you the Legendary Threads and Reapers' Game Survival sets, for a little boost right out of the gate.\nNothing on the NEO: The World Ends With You Steam page indicates its Steam Deck status yet. It does have full controller support though, so that's at least an indicator that it's worth testing out.\nA new world\nNEO is the follow-up to The World Ends With You, a Nintendo DS game that launched in 2007 in Japan and 2008 abroad. The original has since seen several ports and been hailed as one of the DS' better games.\nWith NEO, Square Enix and h.a.n.d. took on a new tale (with some eventual tie-ins to the old, of course) and it came out alright. Its novel approach to the combat was interesting; new systems often had trouble mimicking the dual-screen battles that made The World Ends With You so unique,  so NEO went for a different approach that still tried to capture that puck-passing, pin-slamming combat.\nEven though NEO has some stiff competition this month for RPGs to play on Steam, it's still worth a look if you've ever been curious. It's a stylish, more modern RPG that uses its death game setting pretty well, with an absolutely stellar soundtrack.\nNEO: The World Ends With You is available on Steam for PC here.\nThe post NEO: The World Ends With You drops onto Steam today appeared first on Destructoid.",

Today, Konami revealed Silent Hill f, a forthcoming game set in 1960's Japan.\nThis \"beautiful yet horrifying\" world has an intriguing lineup of developers. Neobards Entertainment is developing, alongside producer Motoi Okamoto and creature and character design by kera.\nRyukishi07, the pen name behind stories like Higurashi When They Cry and Umineko When They Cry, is writing Silent Hill f.

We didn't get too much of an idea what that looks like, but the trailer definitely had a weird, live-stream horror vibe.\nWith all that, plus a new movie on the way, there is a surprising amount of Silent Hill suddenly on its way.

One of the exciting upcoming titles previewed during the stream is a new spin-off title made by Annapurna and award-winning studio No Code called Silent Hill: Townfall.\nThe teaser trailer opens with a mysterious voice on some kind of tape recorder that also features a screen showing some creepy images, as is the way of horror games. Unfortunately the trailer doesn't give us much info as to what the gameplay or story might look like, but tonally, it seems like it'll fit right in with the rest of the Silent Hill series.\nhttps://youtu.be/oRvRWBQNrSI?t=1329\nNo Code creative director Jon McKellan then appeared to give fans a little more insight into what to expect from the game. He describes how playing the original Silent Hill game in 1999 made him a lifelong fan, and how that title has influenced the types of games his studio has created in their previous releases, Observation and Stories Untold.\n\"It's a real honor for us to bring a new title to this series that both respects the source material, but also does something a little different with it,\" McKellan said. \"At No Code, we're all about weaving that [psychological horror] narrative and that experience into every aspect of our game design, our audio, our visuals, even our UI.\"\nThe studio doesn't have any more to share as of now, but it's exciting to just know that this game is happening at all. Given No Code's track record, especially with them working with Annapurna, I have some pretty high hopes that Silent Hill: Townfall will deliver both a terrifying and narratively fulfilling entry in the series.\nThe post Annapurna and No Code tease spooky new spin-off Silent Hill: Townfall appeared first on Destructoid.",

RPG, it sounds like Mortal Kombat: Onslaught will feature an abundance of goodies to gather, or likely — being a WB Games joint — buy.\n\"We are pushing the boundaries of Mortal Kombat to allow players to experience the franchise in new ways, while still staying true to its core visceral nature,\" said Ed Boon, Chief Creative Officer of NetherRealm Studios. “With Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, we reimagined Mortal Kombat into a strategic team-based collection RPG with fast-paced, group melee combat that both new and existing fans can enjoy.\"\nNRS did not release any trailer or screens from the new project, aside from some key splash art depicting MK legends such as Raiden, Baraka, Jade, and, of course, Sub-Zero and Scorpion, battling it out in the plains of Outworld. I'm sure that NetherRealm and WB Games will be sure to ply us with more details and information as development continues.\nMortal Kombat: Onslaught will launch on iOS and Android platforms in 2023. Interested Outworlders can sign up for more info over at the official website.\nThe post Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, a kollection mobile RPG, is koming in 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Hazardous high-speed drifts, bone-rattling handbrake turns, and a dose of the old nitrous oxide are all tools that will help the savvy racer put distance between themselves and a jail cell — at the ultimate risk of a brutal, wall-shattering smash and the loss of more than just First Place.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5aU75h7Yzs&t\nAnd in the midst of this Most Wanted-style chicanery, Criterion Games' latest road-ripper absolute stuns with its beautiful visuals, impactful colors, unique marriage of typical CG visuals and traditional animation, and immersive lighting, shadow, and weather effects, all gunning at silky smooth frame rates. By choosing to gun for current-gen platforms only, Need for Speed Unbound is clearly aiming to wow its fanbase with its speed, polish, and bespoke visual style...

And when The Callisto Protocol arrives, it will have a 60 FPS performance mode option.\nThe survival-horror game was recently displayed with a February 12 date on the Epic Games Store, as reported by TheGamer. However, in a new tweet, Striking Distance confirms it's still on track for December 2.\nIn the same tweet, the dev confirms that The Callisto Protocol will ship with a 60 FPS performance mode.\nhttps://twitter.com/CallistoTheGame/status/1582510201898299392\nFor the release date mix-up, my unfounded, speculative guess is there was a 12/2 - 2/12 mix-up. Dates are silly.\nHowever, the performance mode note is an interesting addition.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPHWaFRTqFA\nSurviving at 60 frames per second\nWB Games Montreal made some news when a developer confirmed on Discord that Gotham Knights' console iterations would not have a performance mode. There will only be 30 FPS options for the new Bat-family beat 'em up.\nGotham Knights moved from being a cross-gen launch to only releasing on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. PC players, meanwhile, will be able to get 60 FPS out of the brawler if their rig can handle it.\nWhether this was an intentional jab or just a confirmation, it's still at least good news for folks who like lots of frames in their horror games.\nThe Callisto Protocol is the debut game from Striking Distance Studios, founded by Dead Space co-creator Glen Schofield. While once set within the PUBG universe, the world is now its own and its looking to tell a pretty scary, visceral survival horror story.\nI'd have to imagine those brutal fights with space terrors will probably look nice running at 60 FPS.

          "description": "Warner Bros. Games has announced Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, a mobile-exclusive Mortal Kombat experience. The game is described as a collection role-playing game where players build a roster of fighters from the Mortal Kombat universe and “unleash them in massive real-time group battles.” It’s more than just battles, though – Onslaught is also said to feature a cinematic story experience where fighters have to defeat a “dark and dangerous threat.”\nThis is not the first time Mortal Kombat has appeared on a mobile device. Mortal Kombat Mobile was released in 2015 alongside Mortal Kombat X and eventually adapted characters and features from Mortal Kombat 11 as well. Mortal Kombat Mobile has been downloaded over 150 million times since its launch, so it’s no wonder WB Games wants to release more games from the franchise.\nOctober 8 marked the series’ 30th anniversary, and Mortal Kombat: Onslaught seems to be a celebration of that. Not only is it the newest mobile game in the series, but it’s also the most recent title since the release of Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate in 2020. As far as the future of the series is concerned outside of the mobile market, Netherrealm has been pretty quiet lately. Outside of our interview with franchise co-creator Ed Boon where he said we'd have to wait a little longer, the most recent news we’ve received has been this tweet:\nPatiently waiting for news on NRS’s next game…. pic.twitter.com/1ulQHZhnKx\nOctober 15, 2022\nMortal Kombat: Onslaught is coming out sometime in 2023.

It retains the core strategic gameplay of the original, so if you liked the first game, you’ll probably enjoy this as well. Removing the grid and having freedom of movement feels liberating, however, and is one of the big game-changers. It's interesting because this doesn't change my approach to playing a turn-based tactics game.

The most persistent is that Bloober Team, creators of The Medium and Layers of Fear, is remaking Silent Hill 2. Late September, it was reported that a title called Silent Hill: The Short Message had been rated in South Korea. \nThe last full-fledged Silent Hill game was 2012’s ill-recieved Book of Memories for PS Vita. Of course, there was also 2014's P.T., the formerly playable teaser for Hideo Kojima's canceled Silent Hills. \nFor years, Silent Hill fans have had to settle for rumor and innuendo in regards to what’s next for the series, so hopefully, Wednesday’s presentation rewards that patience with some exciting announcements.

A new system called the Intensity Spawn Director remixes necromorph spawn points, ensuring they’ll ambush veteran players in unexpected ways and, sometimes, in greater numbers.

Their name is Bellibolt, and they’re the signature partner of Iono, the newest gym leader from Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.\n\n\nIn Wednesday’s initial video, Iono introduced herself as not just a gym leader but also a streamer. She then asked her fictional followers to guess what her mystery partner Pokémon was based on a handful of details, including its type, the placement of its eyes, and the fact that it’s “so cute.” If you had trouble guessing, don't feel bad; today, we’ve learned that her partner is a new Pokémon altogether.\nNintendo and The Pokémon Company released a series of follow-up tweets, giving us new information about Bellibolt that sounds like it was pulled right from the Pokédex. One of the images reveals that they have a new ability called \"Electromorphosis,\" which allows Bellibolt to power up their next electric-type move after being hit by an attack.\nSay hello to the new EleFrog Pokémon, Bellibolt!\n#PokemonScarletViolet\nhttps://t.co/z7lNKThsDX pic.twitter.com/EUdcQcsUoA\nOctober 14, 2022\nYou'll be able to add Bellibolt to your team when Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet come to switch on November 18.

You can read the full statement below (click the image to enlarge).\nResurgence was first announced during The Game Awards 2021 and is a choice-driven adventure game that follows a similar design template to Telltale Games’ titles (Dramatic Labs consists of ex-Telltale employees). The story unfolds shortly after the events of Star Trek: The Next Generation as players control two original characters, an officer and a commander, to solve a mystery aboard the U.S.S. Resolute. The narrative and your relationships change depending on your choices, and gameplay features light combat and puzzle-solving. Resurgence is currently slated to launch on PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. \nWe played a demo of Star Trek: Resurgence during Summer Game Fest in June, and you can read our hands-on impressions here. You can also keep up with the plethora of big titles that have been delayed to 2023 by checking out this list.",

The multiverse takes center stage this time around, and we finally get real looks at the alternative versions of Bayonetta and what they bring to the table.\nIn addition to Bayonetta and Viola, we see what appear to be three Bayonetta variants. One has a youthful, almost teenage popstar look with strawberry-blonde hair and a hip-hop-esque fashion sense. Another version is clad in almost samurai-like armor. No matter the Bayonetta, the action unleashed by them looks as bonkers as you’d expect.

Improvements include ray-traced reflections/shadows, unlocked framerate, ultra-widescreen support, Nvidia DLSS 3/DLAA support, Nvidia Reflex, and DualSense controller support. Check it out below.\n\n\nHere are the PC specifications as well (click the image to enlarge). \nWe scored Miles Morales a 9 out of 10 when it was released in November 2020. Former editor Andrew Reiner wrote in his review that: \n\"For a second act, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales satisfies. Taking to the web-line and soaring across a wintery New York skyline is every bit as enthralling as it was before, and Miles develops into a fantastic hero. This follow-up doesn’t have as much of a sinister punch, but it delivers some great plot twists and concludes with another eye-opening post-credits sequence that teases an exciting future for Insomniac’s Spider-Man series.\"",

          "description": "Final Fantasy VII The First Soldier, the mobile multiplayer battle royale, is being shut down in January. The news comes a month shy of the game's one-year anniversary, having launched for iOS and Android in November 2021. \nSquare Enix states that it feels it hasn’t delivered the experience it aimed for, so it will begin winding down service starting today. A roadmap on the game’s website lists a three-step sunsetting schedule. Today, you can no longer purchase Shinra credits from the shop, but you can still spend the credits you own until the game shuts down. On November 1, support for non-English localization ends (meaning text will only be displayed in English going forward). Finally, on January 11, The First Soldier goes offline for good.\nHere's the full End of Service announcement via Twitter:\nThe First Soldier was revealed in February 2021 alongside another mobile FFVII RPG, Ever Crisis (which has yet to release but has a closed beta planned for this year). The third-person battle royale took place before the events of FFVII and pit 75 players against each other as SOLDIER candidates. In addition to using firearms, players wield magic and even summons. Square previously stated The First Soldier was an attempt to attract a wider fanbase to the FFVII universe while giving existing fans a new way to enjoy its mythos. \nUnfortunately, this isn't the first Square Enix published multiplayer game to get the axe this year. Babylon's Fall, Platinum Games' live-service action RPG, is also being shutdown in February, less than a year after its ill-received launch. \nWhile The First Soldier is going away, plenty of FFVII content is in the pipeline. As previously mentioned, Ever Crisis remains on the docket, and Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion releases on December 13. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the follow-up to Remake, is scheduled to launch next winter.",

Check out the gym leader Iono trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, there's a lot going on in this new video. Iono is very much a Paldean influencer, which is a fun addition to the universe of Pokémon, but she's also a gym leader that we'll be facing off against in the game. As for her type, it's Electric, and while not confirmed, it seems the video is hinting toward a gym challenge for her. Before actually battling her, we might have to successfully complete her \"who's that Pokémon?\" test.\nIn this instance, she describes her very own Pokémon pal, but we don't get the answer. Perhaps we're meant to know what it is based on her description or maybe she's describing a Pokémon we haven't yet met. Only time will tell. Fortunately, we don't have to wait too much longer to meet this \"Supercharged Streamer\" because Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet hit Switch on November 18. \nIn the meantime, check out this 14-minute Pokémon Scarlet and Violet gameplay trailer from last week, and then watch this video all about Wiglett, a new Diglett-like Pokémon. Check out this trailer all about competitive play after that, and then read our Pokémon Scarlet and Violet preview for more details about Paldea, Terastallizing, and more. \nDo you have an idea of which Pokémon Iono is describing in today's trailer?

          "description": "Witchfire has been one of the most promising-looking shooters since its reveal in 2017. The dark fantasy romp was slated to launch in early access later this year, but a shift in design has forced developer The Astronauts to push that launch into next year.\nThe Astronauts has decided to rework Witchfire’s arena-style combat into an open-world format. Creative director Adrian Chmielarz writes in a blog post that the change makes Witchfire a “better” game. \n“The feature is now 95% implemented. It makes the game better. It is kind of hard for me to imagine the player did not have that freedom before. Sure, you can still be trapped by the witch in this or that spot, and some doors will be closed until you find a key, and it might be too dangerous to enter areas closer to the boss before you are ready– but the world is wide open for you to explore in almost any order, and you can both push forward and retreat as you please.”\nChmielarz also teases more Witchfire news to emerge in the next week or so. It won’t be gameplay footage but rather content promoting the game’s art and world in some fashion. \nWitchfire blends gunplay with the supernatural as players wield guns and magic to fend off otherworldly threats. The game is set in an alternate reality where you’re tasked with hunting down a witch at the behest of the church. The Astronauts previously developed The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, and the studio is made up of ex-People Can Fly employees. \nWitchfire is still slated to launch on PC via The Epic Game Store in early 2023.

Thankfully, fans only have to wait a few months before all three acclaimed RPG’s become available on modern platforms. \nOn January 19, Persona 3 Portable arrives on PlayStation 4, Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam. That same day, Persona 4 Golden will hit PlayStation 4, Xbox platforms (including Windows), and Switch. Both titles will also be available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.\nPersona 3 Portable is the enhanced PSP port of 2007’s Persona 3 (which originally released on PlayStation 2). It launched in 2010 and has never been ported beyond Sony’s handheld. Similarly, Persona 4 Golden is a PS Vita title and the definitive version of its entry, Persona 4. Golden launched in 2012 and has only migrated to Steam, but that didn’t happen until 2020. \nTo learn more about each game, check out our reviews for Persona 3 Portable here and Persona 4 Golden here.",

You can tune in on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to join in on the fun, or catch the archive when it hits on our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. \nReleased in October 2014 as a Wii U exclusive, Bayonetta 2 is a sequel that almost didn't happen. Despite a strong critical reception to the first game, sales didn't meet expectations, leading to publisher Sega passing on a follow-up. Thankfully, Nintendo swooped in to fund and publish Bayonetta 2, locking it in as a third-party exclusive. Bayonetta 2 features improved combat, new features, an even nuttier plot, and a near-bottomless well of action.

If you're looking for a special Mortal Kombat announcement, though, keep your expectations in check.

Spoiler for Bayonetta 1: Cereza is the child version of Bayonetta, so perhaps our hero simply wanted to return to her adolescent roots. However, the third game's focus on the multiverse has prompted some fans to consider a more tantalizing theory. \nFirst, to provide some context, here's a (relatively) quick refresher of Bayonetta's backstory for newcomers or lapsed fans.

It features the slick realistic visuals fans of the series know quite well but this time, it's mixed with an almost anime-like animation style. It looks great, in my opinion, but it likely won't be for everybody. \nCheck out the Need For Speed Unbound reveal trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Unbound represents a pretty drastic departure for the series in terms of visuals but elsewhere, it looks like Need For Speed. There seems to be plenty of car customization, cops to run from, city streets to speed through, and if the reveal trailer's song by A$AP Rocky is any indication, a great soundtrack.\nOnly time will tell but fortunately, we don't have to wait too long because Need For Speed Unbound hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on December 2.
