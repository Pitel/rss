Developer Maze Theory's recent (and rather excellent) Doctor Who: The Lonely Assassins was a compelling realisation of this concept, and now Doctor Who: The Edge of Reality is a somewhat more traditional take on the long-running series.\nWe don't think it's controversial to say that Doctor Who has a patchy-at-best history with the medium of video games, from the Amiga's Dalek Attack and earlier through to Charles Cecil's The Adventure Games and well-meaning side-scroller The Eternity Clock. The misses, to put it bluntly, are a lot more recurrent than the hits. It's an odd situation, because you'd think that Doctor Who has more than enough locations, creatures and general fodder for a rollicking great high-budget adventure. Unfortunately, said high budgets don't appear to be in evidence, and The Doctor's predilection for non-violent resolution — laudable as it is — doesn't lend itself brilliantly to blasty-wasty video games.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

This video of the character creation is the beefiest look at Paralives we've had for a while. Marvel as the Paras change musculature, fat distribution and weight before your eyes.

In an internal email, chief administrative officer Brian Bulatao discourages staff from signing an agreement with the Communications Workers of America union (CWA) - because \"active, transparent dialogue between leaders and employees\" is better than unionisation, apparently. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Fights In Tight Spaces is about one specific trope that all the spy movies I’ve seen love to use: our main character’s got to a part in the story where they can relax a bit, inevitably they let their guard down, and on cue, a mystery assassin erupts from the shadows to take advantage of the opportunity. The hero’s got nothing but their brawn to make it out, but then, surprise! They actually use brains instead. Nobody ever saw it coming. The thing is, watching those movies, we all know the main character’s not really going to die. I mean, it’s called The Bourne Identity. There’d be no movie without a Bourne! (The Jeremy Renner one doesn’t count.)\nInstead of non-stop fast and frenetic action, Fights In Tight Spaces goes for a different approach, and dissects those same action sequences into a turn-based battle. Rather than the scene being a choreographed piece of stunt and camera work that’s over in a matter of seconds, it’s a roguelike deckbuilder that puts the player in charge of every minute decision an action hero would have to make in one of those situations. Which means, if that untouchable main character dies at any point, it was because of what you did. Most of the time anyway.\nRead more",

White Shadows gets close to growing its own wings and taking off, thanks to an incredible emphasis on musical sections and cinematic presentation. Sadly, some uninspired puzzles and an incoherent final act clip its wings before it gets to soar.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The grim and depressing ones that despise you, with a child and a Stasi man, where the Stasi is actually memories of your daughter, and the child has to throw the puppy in a blender to get over a hedge.\r\n\n\r\nWith its stark monochrome look, ominous industrial environments, and dystopian themes, I can't really deny that White Shadows is of that genre. But while I normally get bored of depressing platformers within half an hour, I enjoyed this whole thing and even the credits.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's a few years old now, first airing in 2016 before finishing in 2018, but there is one particular episode we will watch again and again. That episode is by the Bristol-based comic Mat Ewins, who in this set appears as a self-styled adventurer, film maker and amateur video game maker promoting his latest work Adventureman 7, a sort of budget Indiana Jones meets Tomb Raider kind of deal. \nHe's one of those comedians who uses a lot of multimedia in their sets, playing daft, self-made videos to help deliver punch lines. There's plenty of that nonsense in Ewins' set here, but for this occasion he also created an entire video game companion piece, styled up as a mid-90s, almost N64 / PS1-style affair in which - unsurprisingly - comedy antics ensue. Matthew and I love it to bits, and I thought that in this, the 25th anniversary year of Lara Croft, we should remember the incredible Adventureman and all of the brilliantly-bad video games he was in we never got to play. \nRead more",

It's a monstrous concoction of five roundabouts smoshed together, and as far as I can see it serves no purpose other than to terrify bamboozled drivers up and down the country. I'm not kidding. In 2009 it was named the fourth scariest junction in Britain, after London's equally mega roundabout at Marble Arch, the M8 junctions in central Glasgow and Birmingham's Gravelly Hill, affectionately known as Spaghetti Junction. \nIt's the kind of nightmarish urban planning I try to avoid when building my own road networks in Mini Motorways, the excellent sequel to minimalist transport sim Mini Metro, but its new Challenge City update puts all four of these real-world asphalt atrocities to shame. In this new mode, each city gets a bunch of new rules and conditions you'll need to abide by, and after playing an early version of it this week, there's one challenge that's truly diabolical. Not only does it limit the number of road tiles at your disposal, but it does so in favour of, wait for it, unlimited roundabouts. \nRead more",

I’d just been savaged by a bear, and had morosely jogged back over to my corpse from the respawn drop ship several miles away. It was dark, and also stormy, and also there were more bears. I desperately needed to find and reclaim my pack, stuffed with meat, tools and building supplies, which was proving difficult because your corpse just appears as a small pile of excruciatingly indiscernible brown sandbags. As the minutes dragged on, my mind flashed back to the time I spent half an hour searching for my wireless earphones amidst gails of horizontal rain on Brighton beach, shivering and still half-soaked from a foolhardy morning swim. The experience was so horrible it transcended mere discomfort and turned into, on some level, genuinely enjoyable farce. \r\n\n\r\nThat’s Icarus, that is. It’s obviously flawed, wildly frustrating and frequently janky, but it’s also somehow simultaneously good enough to have kept me playing into the early morning on multiple nights without even realizing the time. It’s like Schrodinger's cat, except if the cat was a bear made of draining thirst meters. I went on to spend another 20 hours (mostly) happily within its grasp.\r\n\n \nRead more",

After Volition's reboot of their wacky crime RPG series was revealed in August, then delayed in November, we were treated to a new gameplay trailer at last night's Game Awards.\nThe trailer is a series of clips, each averaging about 3 seconds long, of different people shooting different guns and rockets and so on. So it's technically a gameplay trailer in the way that loads of different corpses stitched together is a person (no comments from Frankenstein fans). Still, aside from confirming the new release date of August 23rd next year, I think this trailer also confirms that the new city of Santo Ileso is going to be the star of this game.

          "description": "This Is The President is a game that, partway through, had me worried it wouldn't really qualify as a strategy game. As you'd expect, it's about being the US President, and making lots of decisions about running the country and trying not to become too unpopular. But it's far closer to interactive fiction than a simulation, with a main plot whose demands, if failed, will instantly end the game.\nIt has, however, got me considering what exactly \"political strategy game\" means.\nRead more",

But if you can stand the two hour waits and dreaded 2002 error then you’re in for a grand, if a little slow-starting, adventure.\nFinal Fantasy XIV: Endwalker is the final chapter in the story arc of warring gods Zodiark and Hydaelyn, and sees you trot across the globe to make new friends, fight old foes, and get some space travel under your belt. It’s huge. So huge that it’s going to take a few more weeks to soak it all in and do a full review justice. Between the queue times and sheer scale and finality of the story, Endwalker is a lengthy undertaking.\nRead more",

Furthermore, the game is also available on consoles. \nThe game has been kicking around for some time, having first been revealed in 2015. It caught our attention thanks to its Shadow of the Colossus-inspired boss battles. Set in a frozen, open world, you play as a warrior outfitted with tools such as a glider and grapple hook used to scale titans as well as mountains and other structures. As a survival game, you’ll also have to catch food and craft items/equipment to survive the unforgiving landscape. If this is your first time hearing about the title, the launch trailer below offers a good idea of what the experience entails.\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nFor those who have been playing the game in Early Access, the final version adds two final bosses, completes the narrative, and features a swath of quality of life updates/bug fixes.\nYou can play Praey for the Gods on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

Outside of being a very good game (it cracked our Top 10 Games of 2021, after all) it also has a lot more going for it than it lets on. Those who have seen the adventure to its conclusion but are itching for more creepy card game goodness should be happy to hear that a small expansion is out now.\nThe update is called Kaycee’s Mod and serves as an endlessly replayable version of the cabin portion of the game. Players can challenge Leshy in an increasingly difficult series of card battles, with each level unlocking new cards, challenges, and even developer logs recorded by the expansions’ namesake. If you’ve completed Inscryption, you know the significance of that last bit. \n❗️Inscryption: Kaycee's Mod❗️\nhttps://t.co/ohMNIFpK6F pic.twitter.com/c7sfQHHNFi\nDecember 14, 2021\nTo access Kaycee’s Mod, you’ll have to right-click on Inscryption in your Steam library. Select “Properties”, click the “Betas” tab, and punch in the code “givemeascensionmode”. Once you’re at the start screen, hit Shift+K+M to unlock the mod. Creator Daniel Mullens also warns that players should probably back up their save files prior to accessing Kaycee’s Mod. \nIn a Steam post, Mullens explains that Kaycee’s Mod is a thank you to everyone who’s played Inscryption and that he wanted to appease fans who really enjoyed the Leshy’s Cabin chapter of the game.

First announced in 2016, the game was tentatively planned to launch this past summer but will now arrive sometime in 2022.\nUnfortunately, Nightdive still hasn’t nailed down an exact release date. It did announce a publishing deal with Prime Matter to help bring the game to PC and unspecified consoles. Taking place on an abandoned space station, the first-person game tasks players with surviving a hostile AI named SHODAN and the dangerous enemies lurking aboard.  The original 1994 game is widely considered a classic and a pioneer for story-driven first-person action games. \nNightdive has also released a batch of new screenshots, which you can view in the gallery below.\nClick image thumbnails to view larger version\n \n                                                                                                             \n\nAn updated playable PC demo for System Shock was released in February, which you can still download on Steam, the Epic Games Store, and GOG. Nightdive bills it as the final demo before the game’s full release. \nThe wait continues, but some update is better than nothing (unlike the long-lost System Shock 3). In case you missed it, a live-action System Shock TV show is also in the works.",

          "description": "Arkane Studios has built a strong cult following over the last decade. Its expertise is developing immersive sims – games that facilitate unpredictable stories and emergent gameplay through player choice, complex AI, persistent systems, and sandbox level design. Like the best immersive sims, Deathloop encourages you to use its robust suite of tools to poke at its many systems and environments to differing results, which then allows you to piece together the best route through any place. However, unlike its predecessors Dishonored and Prey, Deathloop doesn’t have one specific mission, ability, or weapon that stands out as the best part of the adventure. Instead, it showcases how a game’s many elements can interact with one another to create a truly unique experience.\nSpecifically, the game’s level design and time of day system work together to create a setting that invites exploration and houses adaptive characters to provide consequences to player actions. Add in a consistent ruleset and shared design language that permeates every aspect of Deathloop, and you’ll understand why the title is one of the best releases of 2021.\nThere isn’t one particular thread greater than the rest. Deathloop is an impressive intersection of stories and gameplay systems woven together to create a tapestry deserving of your attention. In my latest video essay, I break down the game design behind Deathloop in an attempt to better understand one of the best games on PlayStation 5 and my personal favorite game of 2021:\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, be sure to watch our other video essays and subscribe to the Game Informer YouTube channel so that you don’t miss a future one.

As for platforms, Windjammers 2 is coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, Stadia, and PC. It’s also launching day one on Xbox Game Pass. Physical versions are also on the way courtesy of Limited Run Games, though it’s unclear if those will launch day and date with the digital editions. \nWindjammers features a roster of 10 characters, both originals and newcomers, and 10 courts to host the disc-throwing action. Like the 1994 original, two players battle out in what’s essentially over-the-top air hockey with frisbees. Lobbing the disc into the other player’s goal is key, and each character sports their own playstyle and special attacks. Windjammers 2 features new gameplay mechanics, an arcade mode, and online play with casual and ranked matches.

That’s less than three months away so you might want to brush up on your kart racing skills soon. And if you’re looking for a great way to do that, look no further than Nintendo’s own Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, because Chocobo GP looks very, very similar in almost every regard. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nFrom the item boxes, err, Magicites, placed throughout the track to the track design and even the way racers drift, Chocobo GP looks very much like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Look, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is arguably the best kart racer out there so it’s not surprising to see another racer take on a similar shape. Plus, if Final Fantasy is more your franchise versus Mario or any of the others highlighted in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, then Chocobo GP might be your new favorite kart racer. \nToday’s March 10 release date news was announced in a release date trailer on the Nintendo UK YouTube channel. In it, we get more details about the game, including a brief look at its story mode, some of the characters we can expect to see, and more. We also learn that similar to other kart racers, a series will consist of four races. Although Chocobo GP has its own series ready to go at launch, players can create their own, too. \nThe trailer also reveals a quick glimpse at a track we’ve not seen before – you can see it around the 1:26 minute mark and it looks like a Final Fantasy spin on Mario Kart Wii's Moo Moo Meadows. Elsewhere in the trailer, you can see the castle track previously shown in the Chocobo GP announcement trailer. \nAre you excited about Chocobo GP? Let us know in the comments below!",

The press release cites the NPD Group, which regularly reports on U.S. video games sales each month, and according to the group, the Switch sold 1.13 million units last month. Of course, those 1.13 million units are split between the three variants of the console currently on the market: the Switch, the Switch Lite, and the OLED Model, which was just released in October. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\n“For the important holiday-shopping week of Thanksgiving, which includes Black Friday, Nintendo Switch was also the top-selling video game console, with nearly 550,000 systems sold,” the press release reads. “With November logged in the record books, Nintendo Switch has now been the top-selling video game console for 35 out of the last 36 months.” \nNintendo of America president Doug Bowser, who recently appeared at The Game Award 2021 to accept the Best Action/Adventure Game award for Metroid Dread, says as Nintendo heads into 2022 and the sixth year of Switch, “the system continues to see strong demand” and that the company looks “forward to even more people adding Nintendo Switch to their households.” \nFor more about the Switch, check out Game Informer’s Nintendo Switch OLED review and then read about how the Switch has passed 92 million units sold as of last month.

Nintendo heralded the title as the end of an era for the series, but considering how well it's selling, it could also be the beginning of another golden age. Oddly, Dread might have one of the longest teases in history, as its name first appeared back in 2005. In this week's show, we talk about our problems with the game's controls, what we thought of the difficulty, and what its big narrative reveal means for Samus' future. \nJoin hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and special guest, soon-to-be-GameSpot-editor Jessica Howard (@awildjessichu) for the next hour as we explore Metroid Dread's lore, development history, and lasting impact. \nIf you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

In it, you play as super sniper Karl Fairburne, who is on a mission to take out high-ranking officers and find out the secret to something called Project Kraken. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nKarl's adventures through the French cities and countrysides won't be pleasant, and he'll have to rely on more than his sharpshooting skills to stay alive. The debut trailer shows plenty of weaponry at Fairburne's disposal, like automatic firearms, rocket launchers, and good old-fashioned knives. Returning is the gruesome x-ray effect on devastating neck stabs or pinpoint accurate sniper shots that cause the target's internals to explode spectacularly. \nLast night, keen-eyed viewers of The Game Awards might have spotted Sniper Elite 5 on the list of upcoming day one Game Pass releases.

Developer Ebb Software has finally spoken up to remind us that Scorn is still very much happening – in fact, it’s arriving next October. \nA cryptic trailer revealed the release window but didn’t divulge any new plot or gameplay details. A new community post on the game’s Kickstarter page only offers a behind-the-scenes look at the game’s art direction. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nEbb CEO Ljubomi Peklar issued a statement on the game, saying: \n“We’re really pleased to be able to share more news on the game and its release date. Scorn has been a real work of passion for the entire studio. The atmosphere, the journey, and the experience, we want every moment in Scorn to elicit an emotional response and feeling. It is our hope that Scorn stays with players long after they reach its ending. We’re looking forward to sharing more news and updates with our community as we move closer to launch”\nSo far, we know that Scorn is a first-person shooter set within a labyrinthine world heavily inspired by the art of H.R. Giger. The pulsating walls and grotesque enemies send the appropriate shivers up our spines, and we’re glad to see the project still has a pulse. The last time we saw Scorn in action was in a 14-minute gameplay demo that you can watch here.\nScorn is launching to Xbox Series X/S and PC.",

Since 2002, Valkyrie has worked on over 100 games, often serving the role of co-developer or content creator. In a tweet, Hermen Hulst, the head of PlayStation Studios, said Valkyrie \"will be making invaluable contributions to key PlayStation Studios franchises.\"\nValkyrie has worked with Sony several times in the past, helping bring Infamous, God of War, and Twisted Metal to market. The developer will once again be working with Sony Santa Monica on God of War: Ragnarok. \nIn a press release issued earlier today, a Sony spokesperson outlined the path forward. \"The day-to-day operations post-acquisition will continue to be run by Valkyrie Entertainment’s current management team. Terms of this transaction including the acquisition cost are not disclosed due to contractual commitments.\"\nAlong with the acquisition, Valkyrie has a big reason to celebrate, as it was one of the studios involved in helping create Halo Infinite, the fantastic sequel that we awarded a review of 9.25 out of 10. Other games that have Valkyrie's touch are pictured in the image above.\nSony and Microsoft are in a bit of an arms race, snatching up developers over the last few years to broaden their respective first-party game development efforts.",

Like its gen-1 predecessor, Hisuian Voltorb still resembles a Pokéball, only now, instead of looking metallic and grumpy, this sphere has angular, joyful eyes and wood grain throughout its lower half. The design is somewhat closer to the Pokéballs you'll find or craft while playing Legends: Arceus. It has a mysterious opening on the top of its head, which the Pokémon website says spouts seeds, though \"it’s impossible to see anything even if one peers into the hole.​\" When this Voltorb gets excited or feels like it's in danger, that same hole is the source of discharged electricity. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nAlong with the announcement of Hisuian Voltorb, The Pokémon Company has released an adorable stop-motion animated short featuring the two-toned orb cheerfully irritating a Pikachu, Spheal, and Buneary. The video ends with a \"to be continued,\" so hopefully, we'll learn more about Voltorb or its potential Hisuian Electrode evolution in the next one. With so many types of Pokéballs out there, with various designs and colors, I'd love to see a bunch of variations of Voltorb to match the look of a Quick Ball or a Nest Ball.\nPokémon Legends: Arceus is a semi-open world adventure where players step back in time to explore the Hisui region, which we now know as Sinnoh from Diamond and Pearl. Trainers take a more active role in battle and catching wild Pokémon, bringing the concept of the franchise a little further from its purely turn-based roots. Pokémon Legends: Arceus launches for Nintendo Switch on January 28, 2022.",

We’ve been curious as to what developer The Pixel Hunt had up its sleeve next, and we found out yesterday with the reveal of its next project, The Wreck.\nThe Wreck is billed as a mature 3D visual novel. It stars a failed screenwriter named Junon who must relive one of the most important and, if the trailer is any indication, traumatizing days of her life. The Pixel Hunt describes the story as a tale about “sisterhood, motherhood, grief, and survival.” \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nIn terms of gameplay, you’ll converse with a small cast of characters to explore Junon’s past in a non-linear story. With Junon dealing with emotional stress and her mother in critical condition, revisiting and coming to terms with a challenging past and present sounds easier said than done. Though the trailer establishes the tone,  the gallery of screenshots below provides a better idea of how moment-to-moment gameplay appears and the game's dream-like quality. \nClick image thumbnails to view larger version\n \n                                                                                                             \n\nThe Wreck is currently slated to launch to PC via Steam in 2022.",

While the emulation of the Expansion Pack hasn’t been universally loved, it’s cool to see Banjo-Kazooie making its way back to the house of N. Given that Microsoft owns Rare, the only way to play Banjo was on Xbox, such as in the Rare Replay collection. \nBanjo’s on a mission to rescue his sister from the envious wicked witch Gruntilda!\n#NintendoSwitchOnline + Expansion Pack members in January! #Nintendo64 pic.twitter.com/pvPD4aRvwr\nDecember 10, 2021\nAs a reminder, Paper Mario joins the Expansion Pack library today.",

It features plenty of Spartans, interstellar asteroid civilizations, and most importantly, Master Chief doing a cool, heroic landing and pose in the sand. \nDr. Halsey narrates the piece, likely speaking to John-117 about how she's counting on him to be special and he gives people hope. We get some beautiful shots of human cities, Chief exploring some stony ruins, and what looks to be a brilliantly-lit alien structure. The Covenant is said to play a large role as an antagonist in the series, though we don't catch a glimpse of the coalition of extraterrestrial races quite yet.\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nHalo The Series is produced in coordination with Showtime, Amblin Television, and 343 Industries. It stars Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief/John-117,  Natascha McElhone as Dr. Catherine Halsey, Bokeem Woodbine as Soren-066, and Jen Taylor reprising her role as the AI Cortana.

Embark took to The Game Awards to unveil its project, Arc Raiders, offering our first big look at the game in action.\nWith Robyn's \"Dancing On My Own\" serving as the trailer's anthem, we were introduced to deadly mechanized threats coming from space that must be brought down with the cooperation of your squad. Plenty of gunfire and explosions naturally ensue. But then the trailer shows humongous mechanized beings that take up the entire screen, giving the fights a David versus Goliath feel. You are playing as the underdog and must work together with your team to shoot off enemy parts and make sure everyone stays alive. In one cool scene, a character launches toward the giant being and chucks a grenade right at its center. The trailer ends by saying: \"They will never stop coming,\" and shows an armored baddie with red eyes rising. You can watch it for yourself above.\nThe game's description on Steam says players will wield tools and gadgets to outsmart the enemy and use physics to their advantage for success. \nArc Raiders is set to come out in 2022 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

Today at The Game Awards 2021, we were treated to yet another taste of what's to come. Suppose you're looking for more information on Elden Ring. In that case, you might want to check out an extensive write-up of everything we discovered in hours and hours of wandering around the Network Test – or join us on video for some hot and spicy commentary. Today, players got a little more context about the world that From Software and G.R.R. Martin have created for Elden Ring. Check out the entire trailer below.\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nThe trailer details the downfall of the demigods, with some style and flair. Wars raged between the demigods, with a grand battle between two champions. A mysterious character narrates the whole thing, and all it does is raise more questions. Well, hopefully, we'll have some answers – and can start exploring – soon enough.\nWhat do you think this means for Elden Ring? After Bloodborne's mid-game surprise shift, I think everyone's anticipating that there are plenty of exciting secrets in store. These games are often better experienced without a full spoiler suite. Still, it's likely that any big revelations and surprises will be saved for post-launch as we continue to see parts and pieces stitched together from the early-game experience.

That's right; you'll be able to voluntarily strap yourself into a simulated crewmate helmet and attempt to survive while a murderous imposter roams your ship. Or, you could be the one stabbing your friends in the back as they go about trying to swipe that key card just right. \nThe trailer only showed a glimpse of the VR game's new look, but the 3D reimagining doesn't seem to deviate too wildly from Among Us' simplistic design. The footage shows us what it will look like to stand in the Skeld, scanning around suspiciously at the several vents strewn about the room while trying to punch in a series of numbers in the keypad before us. Everything seems fine...until it isn't and the screen goes blank. Among Us VR seems like a fertile ground for jump scares. \nThe team did not share more about the title in the trailer, but Innersloth's website gave us a little more to go on:\nreally have an emergency meeting together. (Note: VR version won't be compatible with the original Among Us game, so you'll only be able to play against other VR beans.)\n\nPlatforms, release dates, and additional information around Among Us VR will be announced at a later date.

As the camera pans out from a scene on Arrakis, we see a giant hand holding a portion of the planet, sand slipping from its fingers.\nThe game’s official site has more detail to offer, promising that Dune: Spice Wars is a real-time strategy game with 4X elements. The game is being developed by Shiro Games, the team behind the survival game called Northgard.\nIn the new Spice Wars game, players take charge of a faction vying for control of Arakkis, the only place in the universe where Spice can be found, a substance that can expand consciousness and allow for space travel across vast distances. Of course, players can take control of familiar factions like Atreides and Harkonnen, but it sounds like other factions are an option as well. The game is also promising a variety of mechanics and ways to aim for victory, including subterfuge, politics, growth of economy, or straight-up warfare. The game boasts 4X dynamics in real-time, as players will explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate while they seek control of the vast desert planet.\nDune: Spice Wars is coming to early access first to help further development of the project, and the first chance to try the game is on the way in 2022.\nDune is experiencing a particularly potent resurgence at the moment thanks to the new and successful film, and this first glimpse of the new game looks promising.  \nClick here to watch embedded media",

But it looks like she's not exactly having a great time, as she has to contend with fire-breathing dragons and other animal and human threats attacking her. And she's pretty much getting blamed for everything, with people saying she trespassed on the land and set this battle into motion. Thankfully, she has some cool magic at her disposal, and what looks like a hoverboard to get around with ease. You can watch the trailer above to see it all in action. \nForspoken launches on May 24 for PS5 and PC. The game is said to leverage the graphical capabilities of Sony's new system, with ray tracing and procedural generation.",
