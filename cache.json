The original Donkey Kong first released into arcades in 1981, where it became a smash hit that also happened to introduce us to two of Nintendo's most enduring mascots in the form of a great big agitiated ape and some springy little plumber guy. The game, in this very first incarnation, involved bounding around simple walkway platforms, dodging barrels, and moving ever upwards to smack said angry ape on his bonce before rescuing Pauline.\nFast forward to 1994 and Game Boy players are treated to an updated version of this original arcade escapade. Donkey Kong '94 (as all the cool kids called it back in the day) added some fresh mechanics that introduced a little more variety, platforming, and puzzling to proceedings, and it is this Game Boy adventure that laid the mechanical groundwork for 2004's Mario vs. Donkey Kong on Game Boy Advance. Ok? Good. And now we have a remake of that game in the form of Mario vs. Donkey Kong on Switch.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "\"What's here is generally very well done\".\nTomb Raider I-III Remastered arrives on the Switch this week and the tech experts at Digital Foundry have already got a video up about the performance and frame rate across each system.\nIn case you missed it, the Switch version of this remaster runs at a native 1080p and 60 frames per second docked, and 720p at 60fps in portable mode. John Linneman of Digital Foundry notes how he did not encounter a single frame rate hiccup - so it really is a silky smooth and \"near perfect\" experience in terms of performance.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "When old becomes new.\nNot many game franchises manage to ascend to the status of ‘iconic’, but Tomb Raider is undoubtedly one of them. Despite the original trilogy being released for multiple platforms, Lara Croft quickly became synonymous with the PS1, standing toe-to-toe with Crash Bandicoot as one of the console’s mascots. Since then, of course, Lara has been practically everywhere, yet 2024 marks the first occasion the original trilogy has been fully revamped for modern audiences via Tomb Raider I-III Remastered.\nWe say ‘revamped’, but these are the same games you know and love from the late ‘90s, albeit with the additional expansions included for the first time on console. What developer Aspyr has done here, however, is give all three titles a much-needed lick of paint, boosting the visuals significantly while adding in an optional modern control scheme for those who might not get on with the ageing ‘tank’ controls — more on that later. Smaller additions include a surprisingly robust photo mode and health bars for boss encounters.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "A number of Ubisoft France employees are on strike today after the collapse of union negotiations with Ubisoft management, who have reportedly proposed a budget for wages \"that would be lower than inflation for the second year in a row\". The strikers are calling it a \"badly balanced rewards system\". Cheeky devils!\nThe news comes care of a post from Le Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du Jeu Vidéo, who have evidently been doing their homework on videogame humour. That research has paid off, for here I am writing about the strikes, though I think I probably would have written about them anyway.\nRead more",

          "description": "When it comes to co-op shooters and most other multiplayer games, it's often the case that friendly fire is switched off by default or there are endless systems in place to make it a punishable offence. In Helldivers 2 it isn't actively encouraged, nor is it punished. Accidentally vaporising your teammate with an air strike is all a part of the campaign for democracy and freedom, a hilarious byproduct of human error. I gushed about it in my review, and cheery RPS fanzine PC Gamer wrote up a quick piece on the specific ways it eeks out silliness.\nBut comedy isn't just accidental in Helldivers 2, oh no. I think it encourages playground behaviour of the worst order: smacking your mates into things.\nRead more",

It would be in danger of becoming workmanlike, such are the number of things you can tick off on your fingers like a plumber ordering parts: boss fights against improbably huge glowing monsters, an evil god, catboys, numbers popping off enemies, women who appreciate the combat applications of a thigh-high split skirt, anachronistic sunglasses, horned giants carrying halberds of the same approximate size as a caravan.\nIn practice, though, you sort of can't be mad at Granblue Fantasy: Relink. It's built around a layered combat system that seems impenetrable if you don't take some time to understand it. But really, Granblue Fantasy: Relink is just a game so committed to the rule of cool that the entire setting is physically impossible, and every battle is a disorientating Panic! At The Firework Factory that flirts with being a photosensitivity nightmare. I'm not selling it as such, but it's actually charming.\r\n\n \nRead more",

But outside this guided co-op session, several members of the RPS Treehouse were playing it on their lonesome last week, too, getting to grips with Nightingale's particular flavour of sticks-and-stones crafting, cooking up meat and berry wraps to keep ourselves fed, and generally being cajoled and maybe even lightly seduced by our fae Shakespearean guide, Puck.\nWith so many folks playing it - some diehard survival heads and others who are mostly just glad to be having a break from Palworld for a spell - it quickly became apparent that lots of us had quite different takes on how Nightingale worked as a craft 'em up. I swear, I don't think our RPS Slack chat has ever seen such passionate discussions about UI layouts and hotkey assignments, so we thought it might be fun (and useful) to try and distil some of those thoughts for you. Will Nightingale succeed in capturing survival newcomers with its peculiar blend of gaslamp tea leaves, or will it chaff like a Victorian corset for the survival hardcore?

There's something about that game's isometricky vantage point and precise combination of 2D pixel characters and 3D environments. The last sentence describes many virtual worlds of the late 90s, but none have stuck in my mind like Port Parm: that hodgepodge of green and rusty roofs, the canals cutting through the cobblestones, the smoky chimneys and people filling the alleyways.

If you’re still reading, congratulations, you’ve either got a dangerously high tolerance for bad literary jokes or you’re really eager to hear about Nightingale, the new survival sim from Inflexion, which launches into early access on 20th February. A quick recap on Nightingale, in case you missed our early access preview today: it's a strongly British-influenced \"gaslamp fantasy\" experience in which players travel alone or in groups between procedurally generated fairy realms using magic portals. You can build bases in each Realm, go on story quests and hunt the wildlife for crafting materials.\nLast week, RPS adventurers Edders, Kiera, Jeremy, Ollie and myself had a chance to play co-op with Aaryn Flynn, Inflexion’s CEO and former general manager at BioWare, while chatting to him about the game over Discord. The resulting, not entirely planned group interview lasted two hours and consisted mostly of people yelling at each other about ice ammo and tree monsters, but we did find time for some proper Q&A. Please find below an abbreviated transcript.\r\n\n \nRead more",

That's a neat Hollow Knight-looking Metroivanida roguelike, I'll definitely give that a go.\" And having played its demo over the weekend, I can confirm: it's certainly an intriguing little thing that I'll be keen to keep an eye on when it launches into early access, possibly sometime next month. \nThe biggest surprise was that, despite its very Hollow Knight-looking visuals, it actually plays more like Dead Cells in practice. Instead of being a sentient lump of flesh able to inhabit infinite bodies, you're a magical witch's hat that can possess, discard and rematerialise your chosen sack of limbs at the touch of a button. The second thing that surprised me was that it also has quite a substantial base/village building aspect to it on the side, and the third - well, perhaps this isn't so much of a surprise given everything I've just said, because it also turns out this is the next game from Palworld developers Pocketpair.

Don't Nod - who I am starting to suspect make their magic teen angsthologies to fund their real passion for \"grimdark grown-up fantasy that you sort of suspect should be a book series\" - have followed up 2018's third-person action effort Vampyr with this new semi-epic.\nBanishers has a lot in common with the interwar bloodsucker, including methodical investigations and stacking moral choices, but is a much more accomplished effort. Banishers combines a sweeping, tragic love story with some very decent swashbuckling, shooting possessed skeletons in the face, and being disappointed at Puritans. A perfect game, some may say.

They're a group of game devs based in Melbourne who formed a gang (the titular Grannies) of older people in Rockstars rootin', tootin' cowboy RPG Red Dead Redemption 2 - specifically Red Dead Online. In the pursuit of fun,  The Grannies, using a glitch known to a lot of the community, broke through the invisible walls in the game's wild west and into another, wilder west - a landscape nobody was really meant to see.\nMarie Foulston, a curator who specialises in installations focused on video games, made a short documentary film about them and what they saw in 2019. Now V Buckenham (who has made many things, but may be known to most as the creator of Cheap Bots Done Quick!) to present The Grannies to watch for free online, in an immersive website experience that itslef looks like a glitching out landscape.\nRead more",

          "description": "The major thing Inflexion's fantasy survival sim Nightingale gets right is that it makes procedural generation feel like sorcery. \"Procgen\" has become a ubiquitous concept in game design and especially survival game design, and I fear we've all lost sight of how magical it is to summon a landscape full of idiosyncratic flourishes from a hidden dataset. It's partly, in fairness, that many semi-randomised settings feel indistinct, smooshed together with little of the character you'd get from a \"hand-made\" environment and setting. Nightingale slices through the ennui in a couple of ways. \r\n\n\r\nOne is that this is a relatively storied and text-driven survival experience, with a self-summoning fairy narrator, Puck, who immediately buries you in Shakespearean turns of phrase as he weaves the history of a multiple-dimensional universe of \"Fae\" realms, roamed by creatures of Irish, English and Scottish myth and legend. I'm not sure Puck will be everybody's cup of tea as principal quest-giver and narrator - according to Inflexion boss Aaryn Flynn, some early players have struggled to make head or tail of his dialogue. But he helps conjure up an eldritch mood that sets Nightingale apart from most genre fantasies, including the Dragon Age titles Flynn once worked on at BioWare.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I'll say it now: it doesn't always stick the landing. But if there's one thing Ultros does constantly throughout its 15-odd hour runtime, it's that it's always, always interesting. And for that, it has my respect - even if by the time the (first) end credits rolled, I was ready to never touch it ever again.\nRead more",

          "description": "My excitement for Final Fantasy VII Rebirth went into overdrive this week. Not only did we get 20 more minutes of its gorgeous open worlds, mini-games and story nuggets to gawp over this week thanks to Sony's dedicated State Of Play stream for it, but the internet has also been awash with previews, interviews and all sorts of other Final Fantasy-shaped goodies. Honestly, it's like a second Christmas for me over here at the moment, it's great. \nBut one thing that really stuck out to me this week was a comment made by series producer Yoshinori Kitase in an interview with our friends at Eurogamer. When they asked him why remake Final Fantasy 7 at all, his response hit me much harder than I was expecting. He said that the original FF7 is \"probably going to be always that game my dad played, and I don't want it to be that.\" Aside from making me crumble to dust with irrelevancy, this really got me thinking about older games, the way we play them now, and just what role remakes and remasters have in today's PC gaming landscape. So come and feel incredibly old with me as I try and get my (very jumbled and loosely-related) thoughts in order.\nRead more",

          "description": "When playing any character-driven videogame I sometimes experience a sensation akin to my eyes unfocussing, and remember that I'm not, strictly speaking, controlling a body in a world, but interacting with a simulation that includes representations of a body and a world. The character is just an interfacial node in a vast tangle of visible and invisible elements; by moving the character, I cause objects, surfaces, creatures to load or unload, spring into motion or change colour and a million things besides.\nSome games foreground these interdependencies by fictionalising the simulation as a giant organism or ecosystem, a more intriguing kind of \"living, breathing\" environment which is aware of your presence within it. Amongst these games is Ultros, a side-scrolling, psychedelic metroidvania - or as developers Hadoque might prefer, \"gardenvania\" - which launches next week.\n Read more",

The answer is apparently \"be ruddy heroes in a cute Soulslike\". I think this game, too, looks very cute, although Slime Heroes doesn't have a release window yet.\nYou know what does have a launch date now?

          "description": "Calling dusty post-apocalyptic city builders a trend is probably a stretch, but not by much. I suppose it's a natural extension of the post-2000s explosion of the survival sim from \"literally about 3 ever made\" to \"does your tetris remake really need the hunger meter\". Games like Against The Storm porting over the roguelike element as well certainly suggest it. In my head, that's probably why New Cycle hangs out more with Endzone Dash A World Apart, and Surviving The Aftermath. It's more a traditional building game than a punishing test to be retaken, or the intense \"survive the ordeal\" narrative of Frostpunk, despite the superficial similarity that your town expects to be ravaged by scorching solar flares.\nBut it might also be because after playing it more than I really wanted to, New Cycle matches those two peers by leaving me with a vague feeling of disappointment. I'm just not sure what it really has to say.\nRead more",

          "description": "In survival games, I leave the building to everyone else, or I build the absolute bare minimum unless I really enjoy the world I'm in. I think that's a thing inherent in me, as I've never taken great pleasure in snapping together pieces of Lego, and would much rather earn killstreaks than decorate a back garden. For me, building in most games is laborious and predictable and does not sate my impatient brain.\nBut I like Neal Agarwal's Infinite Craft, a browser game where you slide words on top of each other and see if they generate something new. For instance, \"water\" and \"fire\" combine to make \"steam\", with what's practically infinitesimal possibilities. It is immediate, simple, and unpredictable. More games should facilitate haphazard engineering and silliness.\nRead more",

Dropping somewhere in the middle will be Paralives, the promising Patreon-funded up-and-comer led by indie dev Alex Massé, which has been given a fresh look and confirmation of a release date sometime next year.\nRead more",

The tooling has improved such as with HIPIFY to help in auto-generating but it isn't any simple, instant, and guaranteed solution -- especially if striving for optimal performance. Over the past two years AMD has quietly been funding an effort though to bring binary compatibility so that many NVIDIA CUDA applications could run atop the AMD ROCm stack at the library level -- a drop-in replacement without the need to adapt source code. In practice for many real-world workloads, it's a solution for end-users to run CUDA-enabled software without any developer intervention. Here is more information on this \"skunkworks\" project that is now available as open-source along with some of my own testing and performance benchmarks of this CUDA implementation built for Radeon GPUs.",

Well, Granite Rapids was added to GCC in late 2022. But squeezing in as what should now be merged in time is the initial AMD Zen 5 support!..",

          "description": "Good news PlayStation Plus members and Call of Duty fans! The latest Combat Pack for Modern Warfare 3 is now available for free if you're a PS+ subscriber. Combat Packs are a nice way to get some extra cosmetic content for your profile, so might as well nab this one for free if you're a member.\n\n\nWhat is in Call of Duty MW3 Combat Pack 2?\n\n\nUnderstandably, seeing a free downloadable content pack for Call of Duty might immediately make you think the content you receive is bad. However, Combat Pack 2 is undoubtedly worth it. \n\n\nThe following items come in the new package:\n\n\n\nLockpick operator skin\n\n\n2 weapon blueprints\n\n\nCharm\n\n\nSticker\n\n\nCalling card\n\n\nEmblem\n\n\n\nModern Warfare 3 is discounted on all platforms\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the free content pack, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 is also discounted on PS5 and PS4 right now. It's currently available for $48.99, down from $69.99. This discount isn't exclusive to PlayStation Plus members or the PlayStation platform. PC and Xbox players can also buy the franchise's latest installment at a 30% discount for a limited time.\n\n\nThe Vault Edition of the game is also discounted, currently to $79.99, down from $99.99. At a 20% discount, this one adds an operator pack, a tracer weapon blueprint, two weapon vaults, and one season of Blackcell with 30 tier skips for the battle pass. If you're particularly interested in the cosmetics that come with the Vault Edition of the game, it can be quite worth it. \n\n\nBuying a Blackcell battle pass with 25 tier skips right now costs $29.99. Doing some quick math shows that with the standard edition of the game at 30% off would be $78.98. So basically you'd get the extra cosmetic packs and five more tier skips for an extra dollar. If fancy cosmetics don't interest you, there's no reason to buy anything but the standard edition.\n\nThe post Newest Combat Pack for Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 is free for PlayStation Plus members appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The day you have been waiting for has arrived. Death Crimson 2: Meranito no Saidan for Dreamcast has finally received a fan translation. It’s time to break out the light guns. If you have one.\n\n\nI’ll be honest with you, this is the first time I’ve heard of the game, but I am fascinated. Death Crimson 2 is the 1999 sequel to the 1996 Sega Saturn title, Death Crimson. Both games were exclusive to Japan. \n\n\nThe fan patch is unusually extensive. While most lightgun games could be played without knowing Japanese, Death Crimson 2 features cutscenes and text that tell a narrative. Not only has dialogue text been translated, textures have been redone to correct typos and cutscenes feature translated subtitles. The altered textures not only translate environmental text, but also fix misspellings of English words to better align with the sequel, Crimson Blood OX, which was released in North America.\n\n\nThe team also added an “Extras” menu that features music, videos, and translated fan messages that were posted on the developer’s website.\n\n\nDeath Crimson 2 is a lightgun game, but like many at the time, it can be played by moving a cursor with the joystick. The translation’s Github readme gives some details on compatibility.\n\n\nAs for the game, is it any good? Uh, no. The series is considered kusoge in its homeland, and that poor quality is what earned it a cult fanbase. In fact, in announcing the release of the fan translation, team member Derek Pascarella refers to it as such. However, if I taught you anything, it should be that crappy games are still worthwhile. For that matter, I typically play House of the Dead 2 simply to hear its abysmal voice acting.\n\n\nThe fan translation of Death Crimson 2: Meranito no Saidan is available on Pascarella’s Github page.\n\nThe post Obscure Dreamcast lightgun game Death Crimson 2 receives fan translation appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "February 14 arrives every year in a shower of roses, chocolates, and stacks of overpriced cards, but this year Palworld players have turned to the DIY approach in order to incorporate game-based puns into the yearly celebration of love. \n\n\nPlayers across social media have been sharing their fan art, physical art, and gifts received from loved ones in what’s been dubbed “Palentines Day”. I’ve scoured both Reddit and Twitter to gather some of the best, so here's just a small sampling of the gems I'd gladly pass around to friends and loved ones. \n\n\nBy far the most popular post on Twitter comes from the @PalworldUpdates page. Although not affiliated with Pocket Pair in any way, the Palworld Updates page has quickly become a go-to page for news and information since release. Let's kick off this list of posts with their contribution to Palentines, featuring none other than the adorable Ice type pal, Chillet.\n\n\n\n\nAlso on Twitter, @Jemini_Jem has shared not one but six different Palworld-inspired Palentines, including this gem featuring Depresso.\n\n\n\n\nThere's, of course, the anxious lover always posing ridiculous \"what if\" scenarios, too. Keeping with the trend, @sinillus made this \"Would you still love me if I was a worm?\" addition for the Palentines pool. That question seems a little more plausible in this world. \n\n\n\n\nOne player has taken things to a whole new level, crafting this Elphidran plush that I now desperately need in my life. \n\n\n\n\nWe all need someone in our lives who can embrace our enjoyment of video games, and this player has apparently hit the jackpot. Commenters have urged them to upgrade her partner status to wife, understandably.\n\n\n\n\nUsers in the official Palworld Discord server have been submitting Valentines-themed fan art for the competition, which is currently running, and this user shared their adorable submission on Reddit, too.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe post Palworld players get creative for ‘Palentines day’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

SEGA has the first content update scheduled to go live at 2:00 pm PT. \n\n\nFrom the looks of it, there's a little something for those who want more from the bosses and folks who are striving to go even faster. For the former, the update adds eight new boss missions, as well as overhauls to some of the key boss fights. \n\n\nEnemies like Dr. Crabulous, the Factory Foremen, and the Guardian Hunter have all been tweaked to shake things up a bit. According to the announcement, this includes the addition of \"a few new moves to keep players on their toes during battle.\"\n\n\nIf going fast is your thing — and why wouldn't it be, you're not playing a Big the Cat platformer! — the update introduces time trials and some handy tools for speedrunners. Taking part in time trials will give you a shot at nabbing the best completion time in each Act. The results will be available on the leaderboard once recorded so you can go back to try to best yourself or everyone else, depending on how competitive you're feeling. For speedrunners, the Sonic Dream Team update adds ranks for each Act.  \n\n\nScreenshot via Sega\n\n\nSonic Dream Team first launched on December 5, 2023, taking a swerve from the recent 2D sidescroller Sonic Superstars to deliver 3D platforming exclusive to Apple devices. Those who subscribe to Apple Arcade can give it a spin on iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple TV, and there's more on the way at some point in the future.

          "description": "Since being released, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth fans have reported some not-so-pretty visuals when switching to Performance Mode in the newly released demo. Thankfully, it looks like some upgrades are on the way as Square Enix plans to apply some improvements to the visual quality of Performance Mode in an update rolling out on February 21.\n\n\n\n\nFor the most part, Performance Mode is always going to pale in comparison graphically to Quality Mode. After all, that's the intent: to shed some visual quality in an effort to maintain a stable framerate, often 60 fps. However, in the FF7 Rebirth demo it felt like the quality slider went a few notches too far.\n\n\nSquare Enix's post on Twitter about the upcoming update didn't go into much detail, but it did state the improvements are also being applied to the full game when it releases in two weeks. (Yep that's right, just two more weeks to go!) With the update coming in a week, that will give players roughly eight days to play through the graphically improved demo before Rebirth's full release.\n\n\nI personally played through the demo the first time in Quality Mode, which looked great. After hearing about the issues people were having I booted it back up in Performance Mode and have to agree, there are definitely some improvements to be made so I'm happy to see Square Enix making them.\n\n\nThe Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth demo is available now on PlayStation 5.

          "description": "It's not always an easy decision when trying to choose a new graphics card. Nvidia alone recently launched three new SUPER models (not those kind) in its 4000 series. But if you want a GPU that sort of reminds you of what it was like to help your dad with household renovations, this could be right up your street.\n\n\nAs spotted by Videocardz, Sycom has launched an Nvidia RTX 4080 SUPER. As well as mixing fans with liquid coolers, the cards come with spirit levels built onto the hardware itself. You know, those bubble-levels you use to make sure everything's even-keel.\n\n\nImage via Videocardz/Sycom.\n\n\nAnd I said spirit levels...because there are two of them. Presumably added on for more accurate installation, they do seem to look quite at home, particularly on the green version.\n\n\nNope, can't think of a spirit-based pun in this context\n\n\nThere is one downside to this, which is it looks as though these spirit level Nvidia GPUs are only available as part of a complete package. The website shows them as part of the Sycom G-Master Hydro series, which means you'd have to buy a full system to get one.\n\n\nIt seems more of a novelty feature than anything, unless there are those who absolutely want to ensure precise installation. The obvious main advantage to a graphics card like this is the liquid cooling, which is said to reduce temperatures by up to 15 degrees Celcius.\n\n\nWith the RTX 4080 SUPER running at a TDP of 320W, those extra degrees could come in handy. But, again, it shows that the graphics hardware market is something of a minefield when it comes to choice.\n\nThe post This Nvidia RTX 4080 SUPER is certainly on the level, because it comes with two spirit levels appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "For prospective Destiny 2 players looking to pick up the game before The Final Shape releases, now's your chance. Humble Bundle is offering a bundle called Destiny 2: The Story So Far, and it includes every expansion plus a few extras for $40. \n\n\nPlayer onboarding has been a sticking point for the Destiny 2 community for quite some time. While the game is technically free-to-play, that experience is limited to a few activities and some locales to patrol. The ongoing narrative and the bulk of Destiny 2 content are behind expansion and season paywalls, naturally making it a nightmare for new players to navigate.\n\n\nIf players opt for the $40 tier of the bundle, they'll get access to all of the playable content currently in the game. That includes: \n\n\n\nShadowkeep \n\n\nBeyond Light\n\n\nThe Witch Queen\n\n\nLightfall\n\n\nBungie 30th Anniversary Pack\n\n\nForsaken Pack\n\n\nLightfall Dungeon Key\n\n\nAnnual pass for Lightfall containing access to all Seasons 20-23 content\n\n\n\nThis removes the potential confusion of a first-time player trying to decipher which store listings contain actual content versus cosmetic items or premium currency. On top of that, Lightfall alone is usually sold for $50. The savings speak for themselves.\n\n\nThe cool thing is that the bundle has different tiers, too. If players don't care about Lightfall Dungeon or seasonal content, a $20 tier offers just the listed expansions. At $12, it's the everything preceding Lightfall. And at a measly $8, players still get a full expansion and some of the oldest Destiny 2 content still in the game, Shadowkeep and the Forsaken Pack.\n\n\nAs a bonus, purchasers can know that at least some portion of their funds will go to charity. For Destiny 2: The Story So Far, part of the money goes to The Bungie Foundation.\n\nThe post Humble Bundle has a cheap way to get into Destiny 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Yeah, that’s right; we can now “target-farm” Uber Uniqes. \n\n\nIt sounds like a win on paper, essentially giving us dedicated grinders a guaranteed Uber Unique after a certain number of runs. It is, but there’s still a huge asterisk to this system introduced in 1.3.2. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nTo quickly run down how this system works: you can now salvage Uber Unique items to receive new materials called Resplendent Sparks.

He continued working on the series through to 2002, when he left Konami a month before the release of Suikoden III. He formed Blue Moon Studios, where he worked on 2005’s 10,000 Bullets.\n\n\nRecently, he was head of Rabbit and Bear Studios and was working on Eiyuden Chronicles: Hundred Heroes, which is set to release April 23, 2024.\n\n\nThe statement from Rabbit and Bear studios reads, “His hard work on Eiyuden Chronicle as scenario writer was finished but as his co-workers and friends, it saddens us to know that he won’t get to see the reactions from his fans.”\n\n\nA remaster compilation for the first two games in the Suikoden series, Suikoden I & II HD Remaster: Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars, is also likely to be released this year. It’s heartbreaking that he won’t be here for the release of his follow-up and the celebration of the games he helped build.

The news was provided to us by Sony, who just released its financial results for the latest fiscal quarter. \n\n\n“Today, we're honored to celebrate an amazing milestone: Marvel's Spider-Man 2 has surpassed 10 million units sold, bringing the game series sales to an astounding 50 million units!” said Insomniac Games on Twitter. “Thank you for the support and making this spectacular journey possible!”\n\n\nImage via PlayStation\n\n\nIt’s “amazing” that with just three games in the series, 50 million units have been sold.  PlayStation’s purchase of the talented studio Insomniac Games for $229 million seems to be a slam dunk with these Marvel's Spider-Man 2 sales numbers.\n\n\nThose who picked up the sequel might be happy to know there’s a big title update coming March 7. It will include New Game+, new suits to play in, and more. No other details are out yet.\n\n\nThe news of the game reaching 10 million units is no doubt a good win, after the trouble caused by the Insomniac Games hack late last year. Upcoming plans, development videos, and personal data were all shared from a ransom attack. Hopefully this success can help ease any lingering hurt from that.\n\n\nMarvel’s Spider-Man 2 released back on October 20, 2023. Destructoid gave it a 9/10 review. “It’s abundantly clear that this series isn’t over yet, and I hope that Insomniac never really stops working on superhero games,” said our review. “There’s so much of the Spider-Man mythos that’s untapped so far, and you could keep this gravy train running with some crazier ideas once this presumed trilogy is over.”\n\nThe post Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 sales zip past 10 million copies appeared first on Destructoid.",

Now, another reaches one million copies sold: Cygames’ Granblue Fantasy: Relink.\n\n\n\n\nThe game’s team celebrated the one million copies on X (formerly Twitter) with a sweet-looking drawing and thanked those who played. They also promise to provide more updates for the Granblue Fantasy: Relink, which includes new playable characters throughout March and April.\n\n\nOn a Hot Streak\n\n\n\n\nGranblue Fantasy: Relink was released in the midst of some heavy-hitting games like Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, and Persona 3 Reload. Still, it held its ground and surprised quite a lot of people with its engaging gameplay and intriguing story. A demo for the game dropped in early January, which gave the game some attention. \n\n\nIt also helps that Granblue Fantasy: Relink includes multiplayer, making it a bit more sociable than your average RPG. Surprisingly, or maybe not due to its multiplayer leanings, the Steam Database shows the game outdoing Persona 3 Reload and Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth in player count on that platform. For a series that’s only a decade old and started as a Japan-exclusive mobile game, it’s doing incredible.\n\n\nI’ll be honest: I haven’t had the chance to hop onto the Granblue Fantasy: Relink train. I do plan to play the demo, since RPGs are some of my favorite games. I mean, its combat looks like Tales of Arise, and I know Tales of Arise. It’s right up my alley. We did have the amazing Steven Mills on the case, who gave the game an 8 out of 10.

          "description": "Recently, Eilas Toufexis, the voice behind Adam Jensen from the later Deus Ex games, posted a heartfelt goodbye to the character he's best known for. With hopes of a new entry fading fast, the actor has since said he's been asked to ease up when talking about the Mankind Divided and Human Revolution protagonist.\n\n\nIn an interview with PCGamesN, Toufexis likened the current state of the video game industry to a \"disaster zone.\" Referring to the continuing onslaught of studios shutting down, projects being shelved, and conglomerates laying staff off, the actor opines about how things are at the moment.\n\n\n\n\nWith regard to Deus Ex, Toufexis said he never heard anything official after 2016. Every piece of information that came to him about the franchise was \"unofficial, from friends or acquaintances.\" He also mentions how developer Eidos contacted him in 2020 to ask him to \"stop talking about Adam Jensen in interviews and podcasts.\"\n\n\nImagine giving Jensen a gag order\n\n\nThe response goes on to say that the reason the developer doesn't want him talking about the character is because \"they wanted people to focus on other things from the studio.\"\n\n\nLast month, it was announced that parent company Embracer Group allegedly shuttered an in-progress Deus Ex game. This was on top of 97 people being laid off, which is a headline many of us have sadly become used to seeing these past 12 months or so.\n\n\nFortunately, Toufexis is still busy with work. In a post on Twitter recently, he said he's currently working on a couple of games, but \"I'd expect them all to be canceled before the end of the week or something.\" He adds that he's doing fine, though: \"I'm very lucky to have many irons in the fire. Games are just in a weird place right now.\" True that.\n\nThe post Deus Ex voice actor told to ‘stop talking about Adam Jensen’ by Eidos appeared first on Destructoid.",

Currently, the game has a Metacritic score of 73 (7.7 from users), which is pretty good, but not exactly boundary-breaking. \n\n\nHowever, if you missed your chance to check it out when it was released last year, here's your chance to play it on Steam soon: On April 22, to be exact. Yeah, pretty much on the one-year anniversary of the game's release, you can pick up Dead Island 2 on Steam, which, until now, was only available via Epic Games Store if you wanted it on PC.\n\n\n\n\nDeveloper Dambuster really wants to make sure you don't forget about its sequel, so to celebrate the re-release (let's call a spade a spade), the studio is offering discounts on the other entries in the series.\n\n\nWeird how zombie games are still a thing these days\n\n\nAs well as being able to wishlist the new game, Dead Island Definitive Edition and Retro Revenge are currently 85% and 75% off, respectively. Additionally, Riptide is 100% free for a limited time only. And when I say \"limited,\" I mean you literally only have until tomorrow to pick up a copy (the other two are discounted until February 20).\n\n\nIt was quite a tumultuous development cycle for DI2. Originally scheduled to come out in 2015 – and being made by Techland of Dying Light fame – the project passed through a number of studios before Dambuster took the reins.\n\n\nConsidering the first installment did not leave much of an impact, it's surprising a sequel was even green-lit. By this point, you'd think everyone would have been sick of the zombie genre by now. Evidently not.\n\n\nBut say what you will about the first Dead Island, that trailer still packs a punch to the gut to this day.

In particular, Arzette: The Jewel of Faramore is billed as a spiritual successor to Link: The Faces of Evil and Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon.\n\n\nBut if they were aiming for “so bad it’s good” with Arzette, they’ve missed the mark entirely. Arzette is just plain good.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nArzette: The Jewel o…",

          "description": "I’ll admit, the Mario vs. Donkey Kong series is one that’s passed me by. While I enjoy 2D platformers a fair bit, and certainly love my Nintendo handhelds of yore, these puzzle-focused adventures were never really on my radar. A remake feels like a natural time to hop on and see what I’ve missed.\n\n\nAnd to say it up front, it’s a good remake. In watching comparison videos between the old, oddly 3D-ish version on the Game Boy Advance and this new version for the Nintendo Switch, the difference is impressive. I can tell that Mario vs. Donkey Kong might have felt ahead of the curve in some ways, back then. Its puzzle-box approach to platforming certainly feels novel, as does its surprising demand for precision, timing, and understanding of how to navigate various hazards while routing a path b…",

          "description": "With a little over a month until the release of Dragon’s Dogma 2, director Hideaki Itsuno has confirmed that the game will run with an “uncapped” framerate on current-gen consoles.\n\n\nItsuno revealed this via his X (formerly Twitter) account, writing: \"Dragon's Dogma 2 supports variable framerate! Dragon's Dogma 2 will release with an uncapped framerate!\"\n\n\n\n\nIt’s unclear if the game will have a locked 30fps quality mode and a 60fps performance mode and then an “uncapped” setting that pushes the framerate beyond that, or if it’s simply going to fluctuate between all of these thresholds throughout. it's likely the former case, but regardless of how you can tweak the settings, an “uncapped” framerate is a headache without a display that supports variable refresh rate, aka VRR.\n\n\nIn fact, with…",

Conversely, the trend of remastering and remaking every great game in existence — instead of boldly giving the rough ones a retry — is what's led to me falling out of love with it once in the past.\n\n\nI knew that looking at a simple remaster of the original three, and possibly best, games in a series that speaks to me so dearly after a blockbuster Tomb Raider Anniversary remake failed to capture my interest could prove a challenge, but I'm happy to announce that sometimes I'm just dumb.\n\n\nThe remastered versions of the original trilogy rule.

          "description": "Paradox Interactive has announced that they’ll be handling publishing duties for XperimentalZ Games’ Escape the Mad Empire under their Paradox Arc (alternative game publishing) label. It’s set to launch into early access sometime this year.\n\n\nEscape the Mad Empire has been quietly in development for quite a number of years now. However, with that sweet, sweet PR budget, there’s now a nice new trailer for us to watch and a demo to play. Both of these outline the unique action/strategy mix that is put to use.\n\n\n\n\nI played a bit of the demo since I wasn’t able to fully grok the gameplay based on the trailer. While Escape the Mad Empire is a loot-heavy roguelite, you control a party of adventurers. However, this isn’t a turn-based affair. The action plays out in real time. However, to enable you to control multiple peeps, you can use tactical pause to stop time, and issue commands that instantly get carried out when you unpause.\n\n\nIt’s a neat little system that keeps things moving while also giving you the ability to pull off big attacks against hordes of enemies. There's also a cover system that encourages movement, so your spellcasters don't have to stand out in the open like dumbasses. I haven’t played past the tutorial in the demo, but it leaves a good first impression.\n\n\nEscape the Mad Empire is planned to launch into Early Access sometime in 2024. The demo is available now.\n\nThe post Escape the Mad Empire shows off its unique combat in a new demo appeared first on Destructoid.",

Before pulling into the final station on February 29, 2024, Square Enix is making a quick stop for Valentine's Day. After all, what says love like subconsciously stealing the identity of a girl's dead, but now not dead, boyfriend while also being oblivious to the affections of your childhood friend?\n\n\nWho are you inviting to the Gold Saucer with these Final Fantasy 7 Valentine's cards?\n\n\nIn a February 13, 2024, post on X (formerly Twitter), the Final Fantasy VII account made a series of Valentine's cards available. Each card features one of the nine party members with an obligatory appearance by everyone's favorite villain with mommy issues, Sephiroth.\n\n\nThe cards themselves harken back to a time when I would purchase a box of Batman or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cards to hand out in elementary school. Each of the 10 cards features a high-quality render of the character with a delightful pun professing your adoration for the recipient. Suddenly I'm wondering who would get each character and which card best describes my feelings for my real crush. I suppose it doesn't matter as a nearly 40-year-old man who will just print them all out and dump them on my wife's desk.\n\n\n\nImage via Square Enix\n\n\nImage via Square Enix\n\n\nImage via Square Enix\n\n\nImage via Square Enix\n\n\nImage via Square Enix\n\n\nImage via Square Enix\n\n\nImage via Square Enix\n\n\nImage via Square Enix\n\n\nImage via Square Enix\n\n\nImage via Square Enix\n\n\n\nFeel free to click on any of the images above to download whichever strikes your fancy.

While we're no closer to knowing the exact details of the event, we now know the \"where\" and \"when\": the announcement will happen on the official Xbox podcast this Thursday, February 15. The episode will be posted at 12 PM Pacific/3 PM Eastern\nPlease join us for a special edition of the Official Xbox Podcast.\npic.twitter.com/TxwWJVUbgx\nFebruary 12, 2024\nThe podcast in question will feature more than just Xbox head Phil Spencer, however. Sarah Bond and Matt Booty, the Presidents of Xbox and Xbox Game studios, respectively, will also give updates on the future of the brand. \nThere are a few likely candidates for discussion. The most recent is the report that Xbox exclusives would begin coming to other platforms, including Hi-Fi Rush, Starfield, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Speculation around this news has taken many different directions, with some even theorizing that the loss of exclusivity implies Xbox might stop making consoles altogether. A report from earlier today, however, says that this isn't the case.\nThe other topic on the table is the company's most recent round of mass layoffs, where over 1900 employees were let go from the company, and a Blizzard survival game years into development was canceled. While Blizzard and Microsoft have since asserted that the layoffs would have happened with or without their notorious merger, the FTC filed a complaint. Either for gamers, employees, or the regulatory bodies of the world, it's a viable point of discussion.\nWhen the podcast is posted on Thursday, you'll be able to listen to it on Xbox's YouTube channel right here.\nWhat do you think the future of Xbox looks like?

And miraculously, somehow, across approximately 588 episodes of Replay, we have never revisited Metal Gear Solid. This week I am happy to correct that monumental mistake.\nWe will get back to Majora's Mask soon (Marcus is out on assignment this week) but we took that opportunity to revisit one of, if not the, best PlayStation games with Metal Gear Solid. It just so happens that Alex Van Aken is playing through the game for fun, so I asked him if we could just jump into his save for an hour. And you know what? It just so happened to be one of the best hours of the whole game. Alex takes out Liquid Snake in the HIND, meets the invisible overweight soldiers, and defeats Sniper Wolf. It's a fantastic snapshot of a fantastic game.\n\n\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

          "description": "Persona 3 Reload is finally here, and fans of the series have welcomed it with open arms, happily becoming reacquainted with the high schoolers who get magical powers from a shot to the head. Speaking of which, Persona 3 Reload has shot to the head of Atlus's ranking of fastest-selling games, shipping over a million copies worldwide in its first week.\nPersona 3 Reload sold 1,000,000 copies worldwide within its first week, becoming the fastest selling game in ATLUS history! 🎉\npic.twitter.com/C2abDAwCDs\nFebruary 8, 2024\nOriginally released on the PlayStation 2, Persona 3 was the first game in its series to define its modern formula, combining social responsibilities with dungeon crawling and a lengthy, emotional story. It's been re-released multiple times and was even ported to modern consoles last year, but even the upgraded versions don't hold a candle to the mind-bending masterpiece that is Persona 5 Royal. Persona 3 Reload closes that gap, however, introducing overhauled visuals and mechanics to bring the game that started it all up to the level of quality fans of the series have come to expect. If the sales numbers and our glowing review are any indication, the upgrade has been well worth the wait.\nTo put these numbers in context, here are some other games that have recently reached comparable significant milestones: Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth shipped 1 million copies as of Feb 1, Nintendo's quarterly report revealed Tears of the Kingdom has sold 20 million copies, and viral hit Palworld continues to smash record after record.\nHave you checked out Persona 3 Reload yet?

That event officially has a date, and it's April 2.\nFor Funimation subscribers, you will have to go through the process of merging your account before the April 2 date, and, frustratingly, any shows that were outright purchased through Funimation will not transfer to Crunchyroll. Just another reminder that when you purchase digital content, true ownership does not technically exist and you will always be at the mercy of the platform holders when it comes to access.\nCrunchyroll subscribers do not need to make any changes, but the price of the subscription will rise to $100 a year soon. The merger officially going through does mean Crunchyroll will feature more content, but a price increase will always be frustrating.\nAlongside this merger finally completing, Crunchyroll is also entering the video game space as a publisher. It remains to be seen what kind of video tames the anime company will help produce, but you can check out this package it sent over on Game Informer's TikTok account.\nAs a subscriber to both services who somehow has managed to continue to have a need for both (Outlaw Star is curiously currently only available on Funimation) the merger is bittersweet. I embrace the simplicity of one anime streaming service but don't look forward to paying more, and will forever be wary of mergers being a good thing.",

The series officially takes place between the second and third movie and will apparently follow Knuckles (Idris Elba) has he helps Wade (Adam Pally), Tom Wachowski's (James Marsden) bumbling police partner, become a true warrior. The trailer also reveals the antagonist will be played by Rory McCann, who is best known for playing Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane in Game of Thrones, and features a two-thirds Human Giant reunion cameo with Rob Huebel and Paul Scheer.

Jim Carrey does not appear, nor does James Marsden, but both Sonic and Tails appear and are played by film voice actors, Ben Schwarz and Colleen O'Shaughnessey.\n\n\nThe series, simply titled Knuckles, will be six episodes long and begins streaming on April 26 on Paramount+.

          "description": "Project Orion is still a deeply mysterious game. We know it is a follow-up to Cyberpunk 2077, we know CD Projekt Red is developing the game in North America (Boston, specifically) as opposed to Poland where the main studio is based, and eventually development will expand to Vancouver, with support from the main Polish headquarters. Beyond those details, we don't know much. Implications from CD Projekt point to it being a sequel, but it could be a spin-off, or something entirely different. Of note, Project Orion was a study from the 50s and 60s about the viability of nuclear power for space travel. Maybe that's what CD Projekt's Cyberpunk 2077 follow-up will be about.\nWe may not know much about the game, but based on a press release from CD Projekt this morning, we now know some of the folks who will be working on it. Dan Hernberg is now a Project Orion executive producer who was head of production at Amazon Games, and also has history at Panic Button and Blizzard Entertainment.  Ryan Barnard was a game director at Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft, but perhaps most notably, was the gameplay director at Hitman for developer IO Interactive. Barnard is joining Project Orion as a design director. Alan Villani is now an engineering director on Project Orion and worked on several Mortal Kombat titles. Anna Megill is a Project Orion lead writer with history on titles like Control, Dishonored: Death of The Outsider, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Guild Wars 2, and the upcoming Fable from Playground Games. Alexander Freed is an additional writer on Project Orion and is a New York Times bestselling novelist and comic book writer who previously worked at Bioware on Star Wars: The Old Republic and more.\nWe're eager to learn more about Project Orion, but suspect it will be some time before we do. For more on Cyberpunk 2077, follow the link to read Game Informer's review of Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty. You can also read about how CD Projekt has no interest in being acquired here.",

Just this morning, The Verge reported that Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, one of Xbox's biggest first-party games of the year, might be headed to PlayStation after a short exclusivity window. Combined with other recent rumors, like Hi-Fi Rush and Starfield coming to other platforms, it seems like Xbox might be loosening its grip on its exclusive games. That said, Spencer didn't give us any idea as to what the announcement would be about, so we'll have to wait until next week to know for sure.\nFor more on Xbox's plans for the coming year, check out some of the reveals from the Developer Direct, like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Visions of Mana, and Avowed.\nWhat do you think Xbox will announce next week? Let us know in the comments!",

In addition to touting an AI learning opponent feature for Master Duel and VR experience with Duel Links, a collection of classic Yu-Gi-Oh titles served as the big new game announcement.\nDubbed Yu-Gi-Oh! Early Days Collection, this compilation consists of the very first Yu-Gi-Oh games ever released, including titles only available in Japan. Konami only revealed one game in the collection: Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Monsters 4: Battle of Great Duelists for the Game Boy Color, which launched in Japan in 2000 and never came to the West. \nYu-Gi-Oh Early Days Collection has no release window, but it will be available for Switch and PC via Steam. Konami plans to announce the other titles in the collection in the future, so you can start building your wishlist now. There are a ton of Yu-Gi-Oh games (to say the least), but as a long-time fan, I’ll be happy if Forbidden Memories, The Eternal Duelist Soul, or (perhaps less likely) The Duelists of the Roses make the cut.",

          "description": "Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is one of the biggest Xbox exclusives on the horizon. According to a new report, however, Microsoft might be thinking of bringing Indy to other platforms.\nThe Verge has spoken to an insider familiar with Microsoft’s plans who claims the publisher is considering the idea of bringing several first-party titles to other consoles, like releasing Indiana Jones on the PlayStation 5. The source claims that Bethesda is tentatively targeting a December release for the title and that it will launch as an Xbox/PC title before possibly coming to PlayStation 5 after a short exclusivity window. \n\n\nRemember that nothing has been officially announced or confirmed, so take this report with a grain of salt. It’s worth noting, though, that during Microsoft’s trial with the FTC over its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Bethesda’s then head of publishing, Pete Hines, testified that parent company ZeniMax had initially signed an agreement with Disney to make Indiana Jones a multiplatform game. Microsoft later amended this deal to make the game an Xbox exclusive after it acquired ZeniMax in 2020, with Hines explaining the decision was made in the name of \"reducing risk and trying to get a degree of clarity.\"\nMicrosoft’s rumored multi-platform approach has garnered plenty of speculation in recent months. The publisher is reportedly looking to bring first-party games like Hi-Fi Rush and Sea of Thieves to rival platforms in the near future. Starfield is also rumored for a PS5 launch, as reported by XboxEra. \nIndiana Jones and the Great Circle was first announced in 2021 and had its full reveal during the Xbox Developer Direct last month. The first-person action-adventure romp stars Troy Baker as Indy in a story set between Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade. The game is slated to launch sometime this year for Xbox Series X/S and PC. \n[Source: The Verge]",

While various action scenes served as fan-pleasing sequences, the series was maligned among the community for simply not feeling true to the source material. In addition to focusing on too many side characters and interpersonal drama, the series also took far too many liberties with its main protagonist, Master Chief. With Season 2 starting on Paramount+ this week, I sat down with Xbox's head of IP expansion and entertainment Kiki Wolfkill and Halo Season 2 showrunner and writer David Wiener to learn more about the direction they're taking.\nAccording to Wolfkill, who has worked on the Halo series since her role as executive producer on Halo 4 in 2012, …",

In 9 minutes and 40 seconds, the video assaults us with talking stop-motion puppets, sentient gloves wrapped around people’s necks, throat babies vomiting out spaceships, a samurai that sounds like an infant, and somehow, Higgs returned. \nIt’s so densely packed with weird stuff that, upon repeat viewings, I actually had to go out of my way to pinpoint anything remotely mundane. In a humorous turn of events, Death Stranding 2 is so overwhelmingly odd that every eye-brow-raising visual element is par for the course. Anything that isn’t a black oil-covered tube baby with a hilariously literal moniker voiced by Troy Baker is now the minority and, in turn, the “weird” stuff.

It’s because even after five hours, I still have no idea how I feel about it.\nThere is a scene in The Dark Knight Rises that I always assumed would become a meme, but never did. When Anne Hathaway’s Selina Kyle gets stopped trying to escape at the airport by Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s John Blake, he asks her about Bruce Wayne’s fate. In a fantastic one-line performance, she looks into his eyes with genuine uncertainty and fear and says simply, “I’m not sure.” And that’s exactly how I feel when someone asks me what I think of Rocksteady’s Suicide Squad.\n\nI am not a fan of the genre Suicid…",

In the upcoming weeks we will share more posts explaining some of these features in depth. For now, we need your help testing our work. We need as many people as possible to test this beta version of the 14.X release series, so you can find and we can squash as many bugs as possible before the actual release. To guide you a bit towards what you should be looking for: Generic gameplay bugs and crashes. There is a new Ship Pathfinder; test it out. Buoys are optional to use. You can now automatically unbunch your vehicles at a depot. We added our own interpretation of daylength to the game. More on this soon in another blog post. There are many GUI improvements throughout the game. More consistent look, better GUI scaling. There are many more things worth talking about, and this will be made more clear when we approach the release of 14.0. But for now, play the game, and please report any issues you find. The usual titlegame competition has also been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker",

Powered by Firebase, it's the fastest and easiest way to test your app against real devices, including the Google Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, select Samsung devices, and more.\n\nAfter connecting to a device, you can deploy your app, view the display, interact with the device (including rotating or unfolding the device), and anything else you might do with a device over a direct ADB over SSL connection—all without leaving Android Studio. When you're done using the device, Google wipes all your data and factory resets the device before making it available to another developer.\nDuring Open Alpha, you can use Device Streaming at no cost. To get started simply sign into your Developer account from Android Studio and select a Firebase project. If you don't already have a Firebase project, it's easy to create one.
