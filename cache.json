          "description": "As far as you can get before the game crashes.\nPromoted as a nomadic city-builder with roguelite elements, As Far As The Eye promises to scratch a lot of itches. It caught our attention as an intriguing spin on hex-based Civilization-style strategy when it released on Switch two weeks ago, so we had to check out what looked to be a soothing indie darling with mobile origins. Unfortunately, despite a handful of unique ideas, a wealth of technical issues has buried this otherwise competent strategy game – buried it so thoroughly we cannot, in good conscience, recommend it to anyone in its launch state.\nFirst impressions are good, mind; As Far As Your Eye immediately captivates with its aesthetic. The hexagonal grid for each journey comes in pastel oranges, greens, and blues, while the little characters called Pupils elicit jovial feelings with the adorable animal forms they morph into when assigned a specific job. Gentle music accompanies these calming visuals, enough that a half an hour with the game could help put you to bed after a stressful day.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

In a significant move, it has acquired around 3000 square metres of land in Kyoto, specifically surrounding Nintendo's original headquarters in the city's Shimogyo Ward. The headquarters itself has already been transformed into the Marufukuro hotel; you can take a look at some images of the hotel itself in our previous article.\nThe Yamauchi Family is looking to redevelop the acquired land around the hotel, with plans said to include restaurants, art galleries, and more. It's not known at this time whether the redevelopment will include nods to Nintendo itself, but it's likely the family will need express permission from the company to do so.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Claims surfaced alleging that the company was artificially driving high prices, along with claims of collusion with auction house Heritage Auctions; this extensive video by Karl Jobst also did a great deal to bring the allegations to a wide audience.\nIt's now emerged that a class-action lawsuit was initiated this week in the Central District of California (thanks, VGC).

If we were to record a concert, you can bet we'll be taking a leaf out of a few Nintendo fans' books and using our 3DS consoles to do so. We know what you're thinking: the quality would be awful, right? Well, yeah. But that hasn't stopped others from doing the same.

There remains much work to be done, though, to promote industry-wide understanding and communicate the vital importance of implementing these options for many gamers.\nIn this feature, Isabelle Meyer looks at a small selection of Switch games and assesses their accessibility.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

As a brand, though, it's maintained a strong presence online even in quieter times, with the enthusiast fanbase in particular celebrating the IP in many ways with fanart, music and videos.\nIn recent days and weeks, though, a number of Sonic-focused creators have highlighted that their content is getting flagged as 'Made For Kids' on YouTube, even though they've not marked their content as such when it was uploaded.

          "description": "The Lego games I'm most familiar with are the licensed property games - yer Lego Indiana Joneses and yer Lego Star Warses where you run around a continuous level smashing things. Lego Bricktales is more akin to last year's extremely cute geometric puzzler Lego Builder's Journey, in that you're exploring detailed, colourful brick dioramas, and solving puzzles by bulding things out of titular hot-property block. In Bricktales, though, it's way more granular. You're whisked away into a separate building screen to construct and stress test things like bridges and beams to support a platform, for example. You have a set number of different shaped and sized bricks to work with.\nFrom playing a preview build of the first level - a jungle, home to some lost explorers - the thing that impresses me most about Bricktales is just how much it's like building things with actual Lego. It sounds stupid to say, but them little bricks are really astonishingly realised. It all looks so much Lego it's sort of surprising that you can't reach through the screen and pick it up. It's amazing. It's the closest thing to Lego you can get outside of actual Lego - which is the problem. It just kind of makes you miss Lego.\nRead more",

What better characterisation for the latest tippity-top-of-the-line GPU from Nvidia, who’ve already produced the best graphics card for 4K in the RTX 3080? But rather than be overwhelmed by its power, I personally feel more like the RTX 3090 Ti is trying to trick, tempt and seduce me, Old Testament-style. “Recommend meeeee” it whispers, coasting through another maximum settings benchmark. “Tell evvvvvvveryone these frame rates are totally worth £1879.”\r\n\n\r\nBut I can’t. Sorry. While I am a sucker for go-faster gear, the RTX 3090 Ti is just too far of a stretch, with its sometimes imperceptible performance differences to the £1399 RTX 3090 and a tendency towards impractically gigantic partner card models.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Please don't let this put you off, though, because we do talk about some bloody well good games.\nThe times being what they are, though, results in us having a long discussion of patter theft, because some dreadful American (we assume) stole the \"It's me, Blorko!\" tweet and then just did a much worse version of it.

If the game’s grimdark aesthetic didn’t warn you, here’s another from me directly: this game is brutal. Be mentally prepared to start over, over and over again. The “one more round” syndrome is strong with this mashup of tower defense and strategy.\r\n\n\r\nThe game’s premise is simple: survive. While the standard survival mode is challenging enough to warrant hours of gameplay, Age Of Darkness’s modifiers let you amp up the carnage for a nightmarish good time. See those little creatures all over your screen like bees in an unstable hive? Now picture building a settlement over them. \r\n\n \nRead more",

She talked briefly about her writing and character creation process for her Let's Play-style videos, before spending a whopping 45 minutes answering questions from the audience. These covered everything from her favourite things in Skyrim to her favourite, real-life candy, and also included a surprising number of horror game recommendations. In her own words, she loves stuff that's \"weird and creepy\", and has recently been looking for something new to play. \"I’d really like to play a dark, scary game,\" she said, and the audience were only too happy to oblige. \nIt was a truly wonderful way to spend a Saturday afternoon, and as soon as it was over, both Liam and I knew it was too good not to share. Here's a written transcript of the entire audience Q&A in full, plus a summary of her opening speech, for your reading pleasure. \nRead more",

Focusing on the back stories of just a handful of the titular hundred you'll be meeting in Rabbit & Bear Studios' spiritual successor to Suikoden (the first of which memorably had a whopping 108 recruitable party members), Rising has the air of almost required reading for players eager to return to the lavish, retro worlds Murayama built his name on. \r\n\n \nRead more",

As well as coming with the same memory subsystem as the RTX 3080 Ti - 12GB of GDDR6X attached to a 384-bit interface - it's also faster than the vanilla 3080, with more CUDA and RT cores. \nThat performance normally comes at a steep premium, but today an MSI Ventus 3X RTX 3080 12GB model is going for a low price over at Newegg. They're asking $810 for the graphics card after a $30 rebate, some $450 below the GPU's ludicrously high MSRP. That makes this model actually cheaper than almost all RTX 3080 10GB cards on the market, and a worthy deal for our hallowed deal archives. \nRead more",

No fully-formed, review-style thoughts on it yet, though after an unusually stressy installation I do have a question: does it need to be so god-damned big?\r\n\n\r\n“Yes, because heat” is probably the answer, as when you’ve got as many processor cores as the RTX 3090 Ti, running at such high clock speeds as the RTX 3090 Ti, and with as much memory as the RTX 3090 Ti, it’s a bad idea to try building an RTX 3090 Ti that’s the size of a postage stamp.

Magic is corrupting the land, giving rise to monstrous creatures and ravenous undead, and the source of all of this destruction, Mages, must be hunted and their hearts devoured if the Kingdom is to survive. Like Ska Studios’s previous outing, the game features difficult combat, extensive equipment options, and hulking bosses to slay. But while the scale has increased and the combat and visuals are as slick as ever, there are some growing pains that only just manage to hold the game back from its full potential.\nUpon booting the game up, it’s immediately clear that you’re in for a visual treat.The design and detail are just ever so lovely: from the way firelight gives a soft glow to its surroundings in the twilight, to how fog wafts lazily over cobble stairways in a musty dungeon, it’s all just so utterly gorgeous to look at. Ska Studios have always had a recognizable art style – imposing architecture and grungy moppets – but it’s plain to see here that they’ve upped their game in the best possible way. According to the devs, every asset was created from scratch, and that care shows in every frame.\nRead more",

Years have passed since I last played, causing the vague memories to distort into a recollection that’s nothing like reality. In my head, that first arcade game captured the frenetic energy of the TMNT cartoons I’d watch on a Saturday morning. The reality was quite different, with the turtles awkwardly bumbling through Manhattan while occasionally smacking an enemy.\nThat realisation has never been more apparent than after playing the first two levels of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge, a successor to those early beat ‘em up TMNT arcade games being developed by Tribute Games and published by DotEmu. It captures the aesthetic of those childhood memories and makes them a reality, which is a testament to Tribute Games’ understanding of TMNT as a brand. But it also feels far too familiar, failing to substantially innovate on the original formula.\nRead more",

But while it gets a lot of things right, it's also a literal trek to the underworld: the scenery is stunning, but your legs hurt, and your arms ache from killing all the bandits. So many bandits!

Their user-space software is remaining closed-source but as of today they have formally opened up their Linux GPU kernel modules and will be maintaining it moving forward.

          "description": "Party games can provide some of the best experiences in all of gaming. They force players to group up and work together toward a common goal, which can be very rewarding. Not all of them do that, though – some party games will test the bonds of friends greatly, be it on a Mario Party battlefield, an Overcooked kitchen, or somewhere else entirely. Regardless of the objective, playing games with friends is always fun and when developers specifically hone in on that camaraderie, the result can be a great game that makes an appearance at any and every social gathering. \nThis list highlights some of our personal faves. Here are 10 great party games, listed in no particular order, that are sure to bring cheers, laughs, screams, and more to any event. \n  \n\n\n\n      \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThe Jackbox Party …",

          "description": "The Pokémon Trading Card Game is back with its second expansion of 2022, and this time, despite the Sword & Shield nomenclature on the box, I was most excited for the Pokémon that appeared in games like Pokémon Legends: Arceus. This expansion adds more than 180 new cards, including 3 new Radiant Pokémon, 8 Pokémon VStar, 21 Pokémon V, and 2 Pokémon VMax cards. On top of that, Astral Radiance delivers 30 cards with special art in the Trainer Gallery subset, as well as more than 20 Trainer cards.\nThe Pokémon Company sent us a ton of booster packs so we could see what we pull from this newest addition to the TCG. I was pleasantly surprised not only with the Radiant Pokémon I pulled but also by the number of Hisuian Pokémon that appeared in Pokémon Legends: Arceus. I loved the Decidueye and Typhlosion cards I secured through these booster packs, as well as the various rideable and Noble Pokémon I recognized from my time in Hisui. If you are hoping to round out your personal collection with more Galar Pokémon, don't worry, as I still found several creatures from Gen VIII's main region.\nHowever, my favorite card is probably one that features a Pokémon I did not anticipate being so excited about: Hoothoot. This serene full-art Battle Region card immediately caught my eye and became the showpiece addition to my collection from this expansion. You can see the full gallery of my favorite cards I pulled from booster packs of the Astral Radiance expansion below:\n\nThe Pokémon Trading Card Game: Sword & Shield – Astral Radiance expansion launches on May 27. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking on the banner below!",

Check it out for yourself below!\nShould we REALLY make our schedule release video an anime?\npic.twitter.com/A0TvmYJUOQ\nMay 13, 2022\nAs you can see, the video begins with a nice logo treatment before revealing that the Chargers will face the Las Vegas Raiders in both teams’ first game of the 2022 season. And if you’re at all familiar with One Piece, you can see how the Chargers turned the Raiders into the One Piece team. \n\nThe rest of the video contains a bunch of other great anime references so be sure to check it out and let us know which one is your favorite below!

          "description": "If you’ve played Elden Ring, then you’re familiar with the strange occurrence that happens when you reach the main menu of the game and you’re somehow forced to sit on the screen for at least 30 seconds while listening to what can only be described as an extremely hype start to the day’s Elden Ring session (or is that just me?). \nIt’s a great song – orchestral, epic, and an awesome way to begin the game each time you boot it up. However, what if it was composed in a different style, perhaps as a symphonic metal song? Or maybe a lofi hip-hop track? Well, composer Alex Moukala has done just that and more. In fact, Moukala covered the main theme of Elden Ring in 15 different styles: Spanish Guitar, Nu-Disco, Symphonic Metal, Smooth Jazz, Lofi Hip-Hop, Darksynth, Movie Trailer, Piano Solo, Baroque (my personal favorite), Reggae, Big Room House, French House, Trap x Traditional Japanese (also possibly my favorite), and Orchestral. \n\n\nAs you can see in the video above, there’s not a single style Moukala remixes Elden Ring’s theme into that doesn’t work – if I booted up From Software’s latest, which is great but even better when playing with friends, and any of these started playing, I’d be just as excited as I am when I hear the standard theme. If you like these remixes, you’re in luck because Moukala does this all the time. He has other “X Game In 15 Different Styles” videos, video game trailer music rewrites and re-arrangements, music analyses, and so much more. His entire channel is great!\nFor more Elden Ring, read Game Informer’s Elden Ring review to find out why we gave it a 10 out of 10 and then read about why one Game Informer editor believes From Software’s next game should prioritize co-op. Check out this story about how someone used a modded Fisher-Price baby controller to play Elden Ring on PC after that.  \nWhich style is your favorite? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "MultiVersus, the upcoming platform fighting game bringing together the WB brands under one brawl-for-all, has finally had its first official look at gameplay with a Pros vs. Devs exhibition. In the 18-minute video, two professional fighting game players, NAKAT and VoiD, square off against developers from Player First Games, director Tony Huynh and principal developer Daniel Kraft, in a 2v2 competition.\nFeast your eyes on the video above to see what actual matches of MultiVersus look like in the format the game was built around: two-on-two team battles. KATAT and VoiD are top competitors in MultiVersus' very early testing, coming in the top spot of a closed alpha team tournament, so the action on-hand is fast-pasted. Only four characters are shown in the video – Tom and Jerry, Superman, Shaggy, and Wonder Woman – but there's plenty to learn about how each character plays if you look closely. We also get a look at the U.I. used in fights, with the numbers representing damage taken on each player always showing directly below that character's model. It took me a little bit to get used to the change over the classic Smash Bros. U.I., but I get how this can be more readable at a glance.\nAlong with this first look at MultiVersus gameplay, Warner Bros. Games and Player First Games have announced a 32-team tournament that's set to take place at Evo in August. The prize pool for the event is set at $100,000, laying down the challenge for potentially big payouts for those who place high in the competition. \nMultiVersus has had a few smaller closed alpha tests but will be moving into another testing phase starting on May 19. If you're interested in a chance to throw hands with the iconic slate of Warner Bros. characters, you can sign up for a chance to play in the 9-day event on the game's website. MultiVersus does not have a release date yet but targets PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC as a free-to-play product with cross-play and cross-progression.",

Some of the Motive team revealed this in a new livestream that aired today. Back in March, the team showcased some new gameplay in a livestream focused on the remake’s audio development and today’s stream was all about the visuals of Dead Space. Right at the end of this stream, the team shared the official January release date alongside new gameplay. \nYou can check out the gameplay segment in the livestream below at the 1:18:23 mark: \n\n\nHere are some screenshots we captured from the stream if you can't yet watch the video: \n\nAccording to Motive, this gameplay is technically pre-alpha but the team said the game’s visual and environmental team worked hard to elevate this to a state they’d consider greater than pre-alpha. In fact, Motive said this is closer to the level of quality that the studio says players should expect for the entire game. \n“[It’s] not ready to ship, but it’s getting closer,” one of them remarked during the segment before another revealed the team recently completed its first full walkthrough of the remake. \nAs for when we’ll see Dead Space again, Motive said it anticipates doing a gameplay-focused reveal or livestream in October, closer to Halloween. That’s perfect timing because it’s just a few months before its January 27, 2023 release date. While waiting for this gameplay reveal, be sure to check out the gameplay look shown back in March. \nDo you like how this Dead Space Remake is shaping up? Let us know in the comments below!",

It will be a digital-only release on Switch, and it runs natively on the console – it’s not a cloud version like Remedy’s Control is on the platform. \nRemedy also revealed that its Alan Wake TV adaptation, which was announced four years ago, is still a real thing and very much happening. In fact, the studio has found a home for the series: AMC. You likely know of AMC as the home of The Walking Dead, Breaking Bad, and Better Call Saul, and now, AMC Networks has purchased the rights to this Alan Wake adaptation.

          "description": "While 2022 started strong with a string of spectacular releases, the warmer months have begun to cool, with most AAA experiences waiting until fall or 2023 to finally release. Don't despair, as this is the perfect time to brush up on your backlog and catch up before some of the industry's biggest sequels come to your favorite home console. In that spirit, we're headed back to 2018's God of War on this edition of GI Live to get reacquainted with Kratos and Atreus ahead of Ragnarok's 2022 release date (fingers crossed).\nWatch on Twitch!\nJoin your hosts, Marcus Stewart and Alex Stadnik, as they return to the Norse world of gods and monsters live on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT. We'll be playing the first two hours of the game, letting you know why it's one of our favorites of the last few years, and discussing where we think the next game is going (spoilers: Norse mythology is wild).\nIf you need a reminder of God of War's greatness, be sure to check out our review, where we said:\nYears ago, Kratos killed the deities of Mount Olympus in a gory rampage. Now, in the Norse realm, he has remade himself into a different kind of god. He is quieter and more deliberate, affected by his history but not constrained by it. Kratos' reinvention serves as a narrative hook, but it also parallels the series' evolution as a whole; where God of War once relied on bombast and bloodlust, now it leaves space for strategy and nuance. It still has superb action and plenty of jaw-dropping moments, but it supports them with a new level of depth and maturity. God of War learns from its past while clearing an exciting path for the future, and emerges as one of the best games of this generation.\n\n\nFor more on God of War: Ragnarok, keep it locked to Game Informer for up-to-the-minute updates on one of 2022's most anticipated games.",

          "description": "Netflix released the first official teaser for its upcoming Resident Evil series, which hits the subscription service on July 14, and in it, Umbrella is hiding something. Fortunately, we know exactly what it is: there’s a hidden Easter egg that leads to a second, more gruesome zombie-filled trailer within the initial one. \nThe first teaser, released publicly by Netflix, is pretty by-the-books. It tees up the show’s premise and showcases the main protagonists beginning a new life in New Raccoon City in 2022. Then it quickly transitions to 2036, at which point, much of the world seems overrun with zombies. There are a few of the video game’s most famous zombies to be found in the first teaser, but the second teaser is sure to give fans more of what they’re looking for: terror, zombie dogs, lickers, and more. \nCheck out the first teaser below, and then we’ll show you how to get to the second teaser: \n\n\nYou might have caught it yourself, but just in case you didn’t, at the 24-second mark in the first teaser, a URL appears on-screen: umbrellaisjoy.com.\nIf you head there, it takes you to a mock-up of what an Umbrella pharmaceutical website might look like. However, after a few seconds, it transitions into a Netflix Resident Evil site, at which point you should see the second teaser embedded. \nThis second teaser, in our opinion, is significantly better than the first, at least in terms of bringing the scares and horror we want out of anything related to Resident Evil. Check it out for yourself below:\n\n\n\nWhat do you think? Are you excited about this Resident Evil series? Let us know in the comments below!",

Then, earlier this week, EA confirmed in its financial results that it was expecting to release a new Need For Speed this year while also revealing that it has four unknown games set to release between January 2023 and March 2023. Now, we have an update regarding the future of the franchise. \nWe can confirm Criterion Games and the development team at Codemasters Cheshire are officially coming together to create the future of @NeedforSpeed, forming one Criterion studio with two location hubs. [1/3]\nMay 12, 2022\nNow, as you can see in the tweets above, Codemasters goes just short of saying it and Criterion are working on the Need For Speed expected to release this year. It wouldn’t be surprising if this new studio team-up were doing just that, but as it stands in these tweets, it seems the merged studio is looking ahead to the future of the Need For Speed franchise. \nPersonally, I hope that future includes a return to the Underground series or maybe even just a remaster of the first Underground – whatever it takes to listen to Lil Jon’s \"Get Low\" again while driving around a neon-lit, nighttime city, to be honest. \nWhat do you hope to see in the future for Need For Speed?

This time, the iconic Chucks highlight a single Pokémon on each pair. There are Pikachu shoes, Eevee shoes, Charizard shoes, and Mewtwo shoes, and all four pairs look amazing. \n\nAs you can see in the images above, the shoes are designed to match the main color of each Pokémon they represent – the Pikachu shoes are bright yellow, the Eevee shoes a tan-ish brown, the Charizard pair are fire-type orange, and the Mewtwo chucks are a stylish and subdued pink-ish purple. Unfortunately, all signs point to this drop being exclusive to Japan. \nFirst off, they only seem to be available on Converse’s Japan website, with all four pairs expected to go live this week for roughly $75. There’s also the fact that the shoes feature the Japanese nomenclature of each Pokémon’s name, which is why the Charizard shoes say Lizardon. However, that might just be a styling decision so perhaps there’s a chance that these shoes make their way over to the West sometime in the future. For now, though, it seems you’ll need to navigate the Converse Japan site to secure a pair (or four pairs) of your own. \nIn the meantime, check out the most recent Pokémon x Converse team-up and then read about the reveal of Pokémon Violet and Pokémon Scarlet after that. \n[Source: Kotaku]\nWhich pair of Chucks are your favorite amongst this lineup?

Throughout the decades, Chief and Cortana (and buddies like Buck) have found themselves on Earth, Sanghelios, hurtling through space, aboard exploding rings, and more. But no matter the locale, we were finishing the fight – even when some of those battles were more grueling than others.\nSadly, Chief was absent from the fight the Game Informer editors partook in to rank all the Halo games from worst to best.

          "description": "Lego is great at keeping secrets. The latest surprise for Lego is sets based on the Transformers license, and it's happening soon. Next month, we can run off to our favorite Lego supplier to grab an Optimus Prime Lego set. We don't know what it looks like yet, how many pieces are in the box, or how much it will cost, but it's OPTIMUS PRIME! None of that stuff matters. This will likely be a no-brainer purchase for Transformers fans. Here's Lego's official teaser announcement:\nBegin the epic build. #LEGO #Transformers #OptimusPrime pic.twitter.com/rjdQbdej43\nMay 11, 2022\nLego is kicking of Transformers' reign in Lego the right way: with the leader of the Autobots. If this product flies off of shelves (which it likely will), I'd love to see more Transformers get the brick treatment. Megatron would likely be the second set, and what comes next is anyone's guess. Grimlock, Bumblebee, Soundwave, and Starscream are a handful of characters that probably wouldn't be far off.\nI'm guessing the brilliant minds at Lego have figured out how to use all of the pieces in the box for two transformations: the robot form and the vehicle. Some Lego sets that already exist use the same pieces for three different builds (meaning we could get some triple changers!)\nWhat do you think of Transformers moving on from Kre-O brick building to Lego? Which characters or action sets would you like to see next?\nI'm an avid Lego collector and builder. The only thing that may scare me off of this set is if it is based on the Transformers films. I'm hoping Lego goes with a Generation 1 design, which debuted in the 1980s era cartoon.",

The flow of combat, the density of the open world, and the overall dark vibe align nicely with the Arkham series, which this Montreal studio had a hand in with Arkham Origins.

The announcement comes from a blog post from Electronic Arts that reveals what's next for the footie franchise.\nWith the current deal dissolving in 2023, EA will no longer use the FIFA name on its popular football series but will instead adopt the moniker of EA Sports FC. It's shedding any licensed identity in the name but still keeping many of its deals with existing football clubs and players. Cam Weber, General Manager of EA Sports, writes in the blog post, \"Everything you love about our games will be part of EA Sports FC – the same great experiences, modes, leagues, tournaments, clubs, and athletes will be there.\" \nOutside of potentially losing the use of the World Cup tournament, it's unclear what else might be missing in future iterations. However, EA is still boasting impressive numbers of players and teams involved moving forward.\nOur unique licensing portfolio of more than 19,000+ players, 700+ teams, 100+ stadiums, and 30 leagues that we’ve continued to invest in for decades will still be there, uniquely in EA Sports FC,\" says Weber. \"That includes exclusive partnerships with the Premier League, LaLiga, Bundesliga, Serie A, the MLS – and more to come.\"\nThis year's FIFA 23 sounds like it will be business as usual with more features, World Cup content, leagues, clubs, and more and won't be subject to any of these changes. Weber says that we'll have to wait until summer 2023 to hear more of what's to come for EA Sports FC.\nHow do you feel about this change in branding and partnership? Is FIFA just a name to you, or does it bring something special to EA's brand of virtual soccer? Let us know in the comments below!",

It can inflict a new Bloodblight status which drains health and forces the blighted hunter into \"a bat…",

          "description": "The original Mass Effect trilogy is one of gaming's most celebrated epics, despite the controversial finale of the third chapter. Depending on players' choices, the fate of legendary protagonist Commander Shepard was either ambiguously hopeful or dismally tragic. Mass Effect Andromeda moved away from a Shepard-led story, and players have been eagerly awaiting any news about the next numbered installment. A Mass Effect 4 trailer dropped during the 2020 Game Awards and revealed everyone's favorite Asari Shadow Broker. And now, a new lithograph might be hinting at the return of the illustrious Commander. \nAccording to a VGC report, the initial description of a Mass Effect lithograph says it all: \"While Shepard and the survivors are left to pick up the pieces, fans are left wondering what’s next.\" YouTuber MrHulthen noted that the text was quickly swapped out for something less direct. It now reads, \"The threat of the Reapers might have been ended, but at great cost including Earth itself. While the survivors are left to pick up the pieces, fans are left wondering what’s next.\" Read the whole thing for yourself by clicking the link above. Could this sudden change mean that the Commander is coming back? Only time will tell, as Mass Effect 4 narrative details have been particularly scarce. \n\n\nOf course, BioWare isn't only working on its famed space opera. The next adventure in its high fantasy RPG franchise, Dragon Age, is on the way too. Similarly, story info for that game is few and far between, but excitement for both series couldn't possibly be higher. \n[Source: VGC]\nWould you like to star as Commander Shepard again? Let us know your feelings on the hero/heroine in the comments below!",

However, if it’s like the most recent Indie World Showcase that aired in December, we could be in for some indie treats. \nTune in May 11 at 7:00 a.m. PT for a new @IndieWorldNA Showcase featuring roughly 20 minutes of information on upcoming indie games headed to Nintendo Switch. #IndieWorld\nhttps://t.co/OCOJhqYfD9 pic.twitter.com/5nuNImMLB0\nMay 10, 2022\nThat December showcase came with the release of Chicory: A Colorful Tale on Switch, a new look at Sea of Stars, and several game reveals, and it was a great time. Hopefully, tomorrow’s 20-minute presentation lives up to that.  As you might have guessed, fans are already preparing their ritual circles in hopes that Hollow Knight’s sequel, Hollow Knight Silksong, makes an appearance, just as they did ahead of the last Indie World Showcase. Naturally, there’s no word on if Silksong will make an appearance tomorrow, but it’d be a great moment if it did appear. \nWhile waiting for tomorrow’s showcase, catch up on everything announced in the December Indie World Showcase, and then read Game Informer’s list of our most anticipated indie releases for 2022.

Its tumultuous cycle, which began in 1997, spawned several builds and demos by original developer 3D Realms. Today, footage of one of those early versions of the game has appeared online.\nAs spotted by GameSpot, a 4Chan user known as x0r uploaded footage of a 1-minute, 20-second slice of gameplay from a 2001 demo of the game. The video’s authenticity was semi-confirmed on Twitter by Duke Nukem co-creator George Broussard, who served as one of the lead designers on Forever with 3D Realms during its long development. According to Broussard, he has no idea how the footage resurfaced but shot down hopes of a complete, playable build by describing these demos as a “smattering of barely populated test …",

From felling legends to taunting invaders, running around in Elden Ring with trusted pals never gets bland. And while many swear that From Software’s trial by fire loop is most rewarding when experienced solo, I’d argue the exact opposite. Boss fight difficulty is scaled to match party size, leading to more laughs and terror. Minions peppered throughout the world pack an exhilarating punch but are less frustrating to surmount. And dropping items for others makes character progression devilishly dynamic (my three Moonveils are a testament to this). \nBut somehow, multiplayer still feels like an afterthought. \nFrom Software’s PVE and PVP entail assisting so…",
