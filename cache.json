The third and final game in the Secret trilogy, Atelier Ryza 3: Alchemist of the End & the Secret Key, comes to Switch this Friday, and everyone's favourite tomboy alchemist — Reisalin Stout, or Ryza — will be once again donning her alchemist's staff to find out why mysterious islands have been popping up all around the world.\nSwitch fans are really spoilt for choice with the Atelier series, but the Ryza trilogy has — so far — proven to be excellent. Atelier Ryza: Ever Darkness & the Secret Hideout is a \"newcomer-friendly\" adventure with a heartfelt story, while we said Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends and the Secret Fairy was \"the best game in the series yet\". So Ryza's last outing has a lot to live up to.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Developed by Daniel Benmergui, the man behind artful little flash games I Wish I Were the Moon and Today I Die, Storyteller has one of the most imaginative premises we’ve seen in a while.\nIt seems simple at first. Each puzzle has a title, a set of scenes, a handful of characters, and a bunch of blank spaces for you to fill. The title is key and might read something like ‘A Heartbreak is Healed.’ With Wedding and Death Scenes available, along with four characters to choose from – Edgar, Lenora, Bernard, and Isobel – solving this puzzle is straightforward. Placing Edgar and Lenora into the Wedding Scene locks in their love. Placing Lenora in a subsequent Wedding Scene with Bernard shows that she is indeed faithful to her true love from the first scene, and this in turn breaks Bernard's heart. With a broken heart, placing Bernard in another Wedding Scene with Isobel has them marry – healing his heartbreak and fulfilling the title requirements.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

'5LPP' is a 5-nanometer process developed by Samsung and stands for '5nm Low Power Plus, if you're not up on your microchip lingo.

But an ad for Rohto eye drops in Japan has caught people's attention because the whole commercial uses edited Street Fighter II footage. (Thanks for the tip, GreatSong1!)\nPosted on Twitter by the company (via EventHubs and Time Extension), the advert is equal parts bizarre and impressive. It features Ryu and Dhalsim towards the end of a bout, both struggling to stay on their feet with a sliver of health left. Then, both characters hold up a packet of eye drops, and use them by executing an attack — each getting their own very cool cut-in in the process. The commercial ends with both characters getting KO'd at the same time, joyous and relieved that their eyes feel better.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

This deflated some longtime Arkane fans since their other immersive sims - between Dishonoured, Prey, and Deathloop - had either no online functionality or were still playable offline. Thankfully, in an interview with Eurogamer, game director Harvey Smith said the team are now working to U-turn the decision.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I remember a chill ran down my spine as I cast my mind back to Far Cry 6, where the tutorial island itself was longer than anything else I'd played that year. I was scared Redfall might succumb to a similar fate. I imagined it filling my head with map markers until my head swelled, popped like a balloon, and dropped grey rarity brain matter.\nWell, having given Redfall a go for 90 minutes I was, perhaps, being a bit dramatic. The game may be open world, and may have some slightly jarring open world-isms, but I felt like Arkane's magic wasn't diluted by it all. Their talent for storytelling and level design bubbled to the surface constantly, making exploration a genuine joy. Sure, I have some reservations, but I can't deny that I'm itching to play it again.\nRead more",

Lucky for us, that's not really what we're talking about here, although we do use that as a jumping-off point for our chat.\nInstead, we try to come up with an Indiescovery Manifesto, one that will guide us in the future when we're thinking about what games we ought to cover on the pod. We achieve this through a lively discussion that mainly involves me playing devil's advocate by throwing out ridiculous edge cases until Rachel and Liam want to break down and weep.

It's a lot, but Awaceb seem to take it all in their stride. Never once does Tchia feel like it’s bursting at the seams; its balance of activities, exploration and story make it feel perfectly whole. The game's incredible scope doesn't feel like the debut of a nine-person team, but astonishingly, it is. We've had a good run of Bestest Bests on RPS this month, and I'm more than happy to extend it because Tchia is an absolute triumph.\nRead more",

          "description": "When it comes to SSDs, the brands we probably think about most often are WD, Samsung, Crucial and Kioxia, each of which creates their own flash memory. However, we're missing the fifth place NAND flash memory manufacturer, another brand that creates their own flash memory and controllers: SK Hynix, or as their consumer brand is labelled, Solidigm (meant to rhyme with paradigm for some reason). \nI recently upgraded a laptop I'm testing with their P44 Pro 1TB drive, and I've been thrilled with its performance - and now, this drive has hit a scorchingly hot price on Amazon US. You can now pick up this drive for just $69.99 after a 44% discount from its US MSRP of $124.99, an incredible price for a high-end PCIe 4.0 drive. \nRead more",

That's nearly $40 off its previous price and a great value for a drive of this spec. \nFor the record, the P3 Plus is a PCIe 4.0 SSD, with up to 5000MB/s reads and 4200MB/s writes. It uses QLC flash in a DRAM-less design, but with HMB technology - so it uses your computer's RAM as its cache. That allows it to provide surprisingly excellent performance, although we'd still recommend a higher-end TLC drive with a DRAM cache for the most intensive workloads, like 4K video production. For gaming and regular use though, this is a great choice! \nRead more",

And so, axe in hand, I set forth, confident that whoever I found myself temporarily adventuring with would at least be fortified with adequate protein to wield rippling gains against the lords of hell.\r\n\n\r\nMouse-clicking connoisseurs of a certain age may remember a time when the name Blizzard was synonymous with the most gorgeously impressive CGI cutscenes your tiny mind had ever been blown by, and while Diablo 4’s lengthy introduction comes at a time where there’s far too much widespread talent for any one studio to claim that crown, it is still a goshdarn treat to take in. Not just technically, either. This chronicle of a cursed expedition is a mission statement for Diablo’s new (old) tone, and it sets the scene for things to come spectacularly - even if that tone straddles the line between gripping and noticeably self-concious about past accusations of cartooniness. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Layers Of Fear — recently quietly renamed from its working title Layers Of Fears — is a game that requires a bit of explanation. It shares its title with the 2016 game of the same name, and is being overseen by original developers Bloober Team. But it's neither a remake nor a reboot; although, in some ways, it's both of those things. It's more a \"reimagining\" of the whole Layers Of Fear series to date, as well as its apparent swansong. It incorporates ground-up remakes of the two-and-a-half existing games in the series in Unreal Engine 5, alongside a new gaiden chapter complementing the first game, and a brand-new framing narrative tying the whole lot together. \nI recently sat in on an early preview presentation of Layers Of Fear, chatting with creative director Damian Kocurek. Listeners to one very specific episode of the EWS podcast might recall that I'm something of a Layers Of Fear lore theorist, so of course I was delighted to nerd out over what this new(ish) game is all about. Similarly detail-oriented horror fans out there will hopefully share my excitement when I tell them that yes, the rats are back, and you can even catch a brief glimpse of the Rat Queen.\nRead more",

          "description": "In the run-up to its original 2005 release, Capcom was refreshingly - and publicly - clear about their intentions for Resident Evil 4. Feeling that the classic fixed-camera formula that had seen the series thrive during the 90s had grown stale, this follow-up was to be a total reinvention of survival horror as a concept. Something fresh. Dynamic. Exciting. The slate was wiped completely clean, and from that blank canvas, something exceptional was created. A game that not only redefined the franchise, but third-person action games as a whole.\nFor eighteen tumultuous years, Capcom has tried to surpass the success of Resident Evil 4. The fifth and sixth entries doubled down on the action to mixed results, while seven and eight focused on scares as seen from a first-person viewpoint. Meanwhile, 2019’s Resident Evil 2 remake looked to the past for its inspiration, delivering a masterful retread that blended responsive third-person combat with the exquisite production values of the series’ more modern titles. But with the release of Resident Evil 4 remake, Resident Evil has finally come full circle. Whereas the original release was a rejection of the games that came before, this remake is instead a celebration of where the series went next. Action-focused combat. Photo-realistic environments. Gooey monsters, hammy characters, ridiculous storylines. What better way to remake the highest peak of the series, than to build it upon the foundations of the very games it went on to inspire? Resident Evil 4 is a rambunctious thrill ride that is as good - if not, dare I say it, a bit better - than the original game.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Dodgy reseller listings aside, the Steam Deck has spent its entire life thus far without even a temporary price drop. That ends today, as the Steam Spring Sale has launched with the first official Steam Deck savings - a 10% cut across the range - alongside the more expected dealsplosion of discounted games.\nWhat’s more, this sale could also be the last time that the Steam Deck joins in a Steam sale, at least for a very long time. Lawrence Yang, a Valve designer who recently spoke to us about the Deck’s first year in the wild, has also told me that the company are \"looking at this as a one-time deal in celebration of Steam Deck's anniversary.\" You’ll therefore have until March 23rd, when the Spring Sale ends, to seize a saving on the handheld PC before it returns to base pricing – maybe for good.\nAll three Steam Deck versions are part of the sale, shedding exactly 10% apiece. The 64GB model is down from £349 / $399 to £314.10 / $359.10, the 256GB model drops from £459 / $529 to £413.10 / $476.10, and the top 512GB model falls from £569 / $649 to £512.10 / $584.10. Unlike the sad old days of 2022, there’s no lengthy waiting period once you put your order in, though I wouldn’t be surprised if it takes the full two weeks of Valve’s one-to-two week delivery estimate, what with the likely surge in demand.\n Read more",

Are we just doomed to get bad PC ports for the next few years, or is this going to happen forever now.\nPlus, a terrifying Tower Of Jocularity that challenges us to know when games came out (we do quite well, I think), the games we've been playing right now, and a trio of movie recommendations.\nRead more",

Speaking with Eurogamer, IO co-owners Christian Elverdam and Hakan Abrak shed some light on the Bond project, letting us know that it’s an origin story and that it’ll follow a brand-new 007.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Cut to a couple of weeks after release and I’m having an absolute whale of a time in Endnight Games’ survival horror - and it’s all thanks to sweet, succulent blueberries.\nIt all started when I learned that Sons Of The Forest has a peaceful mode, which completely removes all the gross, yucky cannibals, leaving you to grapple with survival in relative peace and quiet. The first time I met up with Kelvin and we got to work, casually making our shitty shelter and stick storage, I perused the guidebook to see what’s next, and I spotted a planter. A planter? Okay, so I assume you can plant seeds and grow food, then? That’s really co-WAIT, wait, wait. You're telling me this is basically a farming sim?\nRead more",

          "description": "The latest Steam Deck client update has added Valve’s local network game transfers feature – previously only available in beta form – to the Stable branch, marking a full launch for one of the most useful Steam Deck feature upgrades in months.\r\n\n\r\nIf you missed the local transfers beta release last month, know that the name is quite literal: it lets you transfer Steam game installs between your PC and your Steam Deck over a local network, rather than having to re-download them onto every device you own. It also works when transferring between a Steam Deck and another Steam Deck, or between two PCs. Valve have a little explainer here, but it’s simple enough that – for example – hitting the Install button for a game on your Steam Deck will automatically detect if your PC is on the same network, and start transferring as much as it can from the desktop instead of downloading the whole thing from scratch.\r\n\n\r\nYou can even opt into sending/receiving game data from PCs and Steam Decks owned by other people, so long as they’re also connected to the same local network. The biggest benefit seemingly comes to those with monthly data caps (morning, Yanks), as these transfers won’t usually involve any extra downloads. Even so, it’s a helpful addition for anyone on all-you-can-eat data as well, since local transfers are much faster than old fashioned installs. \r\n \nRead more",

Its twists and turns from the get-go have my brain doing mental gymnastics, not just in the game but in trying to figure out how to write around them for this review. I’m not going to spoil everything, but keeping your expectations completley wide open lets Paranormasight snake right on in and surprise you when you least expect it to. \nHere’s a quick elevator pitch: Paranormasight is a Squeenix-developed horror mystery visual novel about deadly rituals, ghost stories, curses, and the occult. Its subversive approach to classic visual novel staples make its puzzles feel smart and its horror scares hit hard. If you’re a fan of the thrills found in the Danganronpa and Zero Escape games, Paranormasight is like a bite-sized version of those two behemoths. It’s short, smart, and will keep you on your toes until the end.\nSo yeah, if that sounds like your thing, then have at it. From here on in, I'm going to be gabbing abut it in-depth.\nRead more",

In this way it seems a lot like my beloved PowerWash Simulator (washing things; time travel).\nThe main thrust of the game I can really get behind - peeling apart big metal ships like clanky onions - but the more literal thrust, i.e. the moving around in zero gravity using a jetpack, is awful.

But comparisons began to surface online showcasing mirrored animations between Bleak Faith and FromSoft’s titles, leading to accusations of stolen assets, as reported by PC Gamer. Archangel have now responded to the allegations of plagiarism, pointing to the Epic Marketplace where the team purchased the assets.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "To track the public understanding of modern-day indie gaming is to look at the small-scale independent development scene through an Anglo-centric lens. While it would be unfair to ignore the hobbyists programming experiences in BASIC on their ZX Spectrum or similar, it’s commonly accepted that indie gaming as we recognise it today has its roots in the early days of the internet and the Y2K boom, when Flash, Gamemaker Studio and similar tools allowed things like Cave Story and N to grow. With online distribution further helping games like Bastion, Journey and World Of Goo to flourish, the definition of the indie game became: a title with big ambitions and creativity grown from small budgets and teams.\r\n\n\r\nIt's not entirely wrong, but it has obscured decades of hobby development that was once at the forefront - not just the stories of BBC Micro solo-development stars, but similar ones of hobby development from around the world. In Japan, the doujin markets of Comiket and beyond serve as a home for hobbyists to make, sell and share their creations. It is the doujin gaming scene that helped major studios like Fate/ studio Type-Moon, and franchises like 07th Expansion and Touhou Project, flourish in a way that would never be possible otherwise.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Walking around the deserted streets of Los Angeles - and you can take your leisure, in Dead Island 2, because most zombies are quite shambly - I encountered many a rich-person decor. Last week, I was given a preview build of the upcoming first-person zombie-smasher and played about the first five hours of it in single-player, taking in sights like a community of gated millionaire mansions, a slightly less palacious but still ridiculous neighbourhood, and an upmarket hotel styled after the famous Beverly Hills Hotel. They're all full of weird stuff.\nThere's a panic room where a guy turned into a zombie mid-demo tape recording. Actress Emma, who you're battening down the hatches with, has a truly awful full-length Burt Reynoldsian portrait of herself. A shared house called the GOAT PEN, where a team of influencers all live together, has a set for a video series called LIT OR SH!T, and a whiteboard with the script for an apology video. I ask the game director David Stenton if it's low hanging fruit, or if there's no such thing with Hollywood rich people. \"Of course, it's low hanging fruit!\" he says, laughing. \"And also, there's no such thing.\"\nRead more",

Dead Island 2 is set in LA, known as HellA as a little play on words, because it's full of zombies now. Your job is to smash a lot of them to pieces with a hammer, like so many sausages and balloons full of blood held together by sellotape. In the course of this, you find yourself merrily looting your way through the homes of the rich and famous, stuffing as many screws and bits of scrap metal into your pants as the elastic can handle (I assume; none of the player character options has a backpack).

          "description": "When there’s no more room in development hell\nWe’re about a month away from Dead Island 2’s escape from development hell, so Deep Silver is getting us primed with a peek at the game's intro cinematic.\nIn the stylish intro, we’re shown various eerie scenes from “HELL-A,” the zombie-fied version of Los Angeles. While it’s no zombie-child being defenestrated in reverse, the intro is plenty moody, with a slow, reverb-laced song playing over top of familiar places in various states of dereliction. While it’s obviously trying to disturb you with its depiction of a vacant society, it does so in a pretty stylish way. The cinematic was done by ELASTIC, who has also had a hand in a lot of cool stuff, and their work for Dead Island 2 is not exception.\nhttps://youtu.be/rCS3Faf2R1w\nWhile I wouldn’t say I’m burnt out on zombies, the original Dead Island left me less than enthused about a sequel. I played it with a friend a number of years ago, and the standout moments for me were when a guy kept pestering us for empty bottles and when we had to go to a zombie factory. I don’t remember if it was actually a zombie factory or if it was just where the zombies came from, but I turned to my friend and wondered allowed what had happened to our plan of escape.\nMaybe there was a good reason why we were going to the zombie factory; I don’t know. It just seemed like an odd detour for a bunch of rubes just trying to survive. Maybe I’ll play Dead Island 2. I don’t know. However, it will take more than a cinematic trailer to convince me to put my money down.\nDead Island 2 is lurching toward an April 21 release date on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.\nThe post Check out Dead Island 2’s bloody intro cinematic appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Defusing Bomb…\nValve has officially lifted the garage door on Counter-Strike 2, the next evolution of the long-running franchise. To go along with the announcement, they’ve released three trailers demonstrating the improvements made.\nThe changes are going to mainly appeal to the people who care about the tech behind the game. Considering that big changes would be an affront to the Counter-Strike community, this is going to be what matters most to fans. One of the videos drops outlines the improvements made to maps, another to “tick-rate” (how the game tracks players and ballistics), and the last shows off the dynamic smoke. All of these are important, so long as you already know how the changes will affect the game.\nhttps://youtu.be/ExZtISgOxEQ\nWhile the engine overhaul is the most important takeaway here, it’s probably going to be important for current players to know that all your gear from Counter-Strike: Global Offensive will be carried over to Counter-Strike 2.\nIt’s amusing to me that they’re calling it Counter-Strike 2, as though Counter-Strike: Source, Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive never happened.\nI went through a stint of playing Counter-Strike: Source competitively in my high school days. I was pretty reasonable at it and spent time with a clan that ran in a couple of leagues, but eventually, I fell off the scene. I just found that competitive gaming wasn’t for me. It was too much stress and pressure, and I had a lot more fun just playing single-player games by myself.\nThat said, I cannot wait to see how de_rats looks in the Source 2 engine.\nCounter-Strike 2 is a free upgrade to CS:GO, and will be available to some players today for limited testing.\nThe post Counter-Strike 2 has been announced for a Summer 2023 release appeared first on Destructoid.",

In a related incident, Hydra has begun infusing its soldiers with undead DNA in an effort to create a form of unkillable soldier, Morbius is hoping to reverse-engineer this formula in order to further develop a cure for his own medicinal misgivings, while further preventing Hydra from dabbling in the undead arts.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xnav8pZSjoY&ab_channel=Marvel%27sMidnightSuns\nThe Hunger DLC adds Morbius as a recruitable hero, as well as new story missions, complete with their own bespoke enemies. A new \"Laboratory\" upgrade will be added to the Abbey, along with a fistful of Hero Skins, Abbey Outfits, and Swimsuits. Morbius himself sports 11 brand new Hero abilities, mostly focused around causing \"Bleed\" status on his enemies, (naturally). Morbius focuses on single-hit damage, and can also activate \"Bloodlust\", which applies the Bleed effect to all of his other skills.\nWhile seemingly strange bedfellows, teaming Morbius with Blade will result in an assault pattern absolutely teeming with the red stuff — With Blade able to cause Bleed with his various chain attacks, before Morbius follows up with powerful, single-hit impacts to put their hapless enemies back in the dirt.\nMarvel's Midnight Suns is available now on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.\nThe post Morbin’ Time: Morbius joins the party in Marvel’s Midnight Suns appeared first on Destructoid.",

The only mentioned platform currently is PC, and no release window was given.\nIt looks great! You get to customize your look, backstory, and even your ring entrance. The combat includes a timing system à la Super Mario RPG or Paper Mario. There are tag team partners. Apparently, the plot involves saving wrestling somehow. I can think of a few existential threats to performance sports, but Tic Toc, no doubt, has a much better plot than anything I could come up with. They’ve dropped a trailer you can try to glean any narrative details from.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/xdzimm8Ri4w[/embed]\nI love the visual presentation of the combat system. Especially the snappiness of the one wrestle-man calling for a chair and it whizzing in from out-of-ring. While there isn't a tonne of details on offer right now, what's being shown off is enough to grab my interest.\nWrestling seems well-suited to the turn-based genre, and Wrestle Story is not the first to try. Mega Cat Studio is working on their own with WrestleQuest, and Kaiju Big Battel: Fighto Fantasy has been available since 2018. Even the WWE has teased that they might have an RPG announcement in the wings. I expect that they will all have different takes on the formula, but for now, Wrestle Story is looking like it might be pretty delectable.\nWrestle Story is slated for release on PC.

I'd wager that it's going to be on roughly 90% of people's lists if we're talking \"summer 2023.\" It's a big game is what I'm saying. And it was also recognized as such at the Famitsu Game Awards this past week.\nAfter winning the award, legendary Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma gave a short acceptance speech, serving to both hype up Tears of the Kingdom and provide a little more info on what to expect for this still-relatively-mysterious-release. Here's the full transcript, with a translation courtesy of Twitter user Genki_JPN:\n\"In the previous title, 'Breath of the Wild', you were able to experience a new world of Zelda with the 'freedom to go wherever and do whatever you want'. In the sequel, 'Tears of the Kingdom', furthermore, the players free imagination will be filled with new gameplay that will bring about changes to the game world. I think that everyone who voted will feel pleasantly surprised and I hope you can enjoy the 'unknown' Hyrule as you like. Thank you!\"\n\"Filled with new gameplay that will bring about changes to the game world\" is the focus here, and while it could mean anything, I'm curious to see if it is indeed just hype, or something significant that they're trying with the sequel.

Eight adventurers, each with their own small-scale RPG quests, link up for one overarching journey. Each one will have their own paths to walk, secrets to uncover, and nemeses to vanquish in a heroic fashion. And then, after everyone's had their origin story, a final chapter will bring it all together, forming the party that will tackle the greatest threat lurking just behind the curtain.\nThe road ahead was already laid out by its predecessor. But sometimes, it's as much about the journey as the destination.

          "description": "It was dated today\nSo we've already gotten three waves of DLC for Fire Emblem Engage, all of which take place in the Paralogue Islands. Think of these like a \"DLC paradise\" of sorts, where you'll meet with more all-star members of the Fire Emblem cast and acquire more spirits to play with. Well, Wave 4 is a little bit meatier.\nInstead of character DLC, this time Nintendo is billing it as a \"new story scenario.\" Titled \"Fell Xenologue,\" you'll acquire new party members, and will adventure through new locations and maps (plural), as you attempt to potentially wrap up this game's universal storyline. Thanks to a new trailer from Nintendo, we do have a date for all this: April 5.\nThis is a pretty quick turnaround, when everything is said and done! Note that Xenoblade Chronicles 3 came out in mid 2022, and still hasn't hosted its big story DLC release yet. That's still coming in late 2023. Granted, story DLC for a game like Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is going to be even meatier than a Fire Emblem game: but it's nice that Engage fans don't have to wait that long.\nProvided the DLC is worth it, at least.

          "description": "Jill takes the number two spot\nIf you asked someone who their favorite Resident Evil character was, odds are it'll probably be a primary protagonist. Jill, Leon, and Chris would all be on the scoreboard, and I expect Claire to make the top 10. Beyond that, it's basically anyone's guess. Well, guess no more! There's a recent poll with a rather large sample size to draw from if you're curious how everyone stacks up in 2023.\nAs shared by ResetEra, Famitsu held a \"favorite Resident Evil character\" poll in honor of the RE 4 remake, and things are looking real good for that cast. Leon took the top spot as the number one most-liked character in the Resident Evil franchise, and it's not even close. Leon has a nearly 1000 point lead over the second most popular character: Jill. That's followed by Chris, Ada, Claire, Wesker, Ethan, Rebecca, Piers, and Hunk. Wow, I'm glad Hunk made it in!\nThere's a few takeaways from this: people still love Leon, the star of two of the most beloved Resident Evil games, both of which have modern era remakes. Chris and his rock-punching strength were clearly going to be in the top five somewhere, and Ada's effortlessly cool persona is going to make some waves. Claire similarly is riding high, and has multiple games to draw fans from.\nThe big surprise for me is seeing the polarizing Ethan on this list at a respectable seventh place, but Wesker, quite honestly, could be anywhere. After his appearance in the first game he's been an anime-like shadowy figure in the thorn of many protagonist's sides, much to the chagrin of a lot of the playerbase. Seeing Piers on the list is surprising too: I don't think a US-centric poll would have him so high.\nEither way, Leon is king, and that hasn't changed.\nFamitsu 2023 favorite Resident Evil character poll results:\n#1: Leon S. Kennedy (2637 pts)\n#2: Jill Valentine (1675 pts)\n\n#4: Ada Wong (1019 pts)\n#5: Claire Redfield (858 pts)\n\nThe post Leon crushes Famitsu’s ‘Favorite Resident Evil character’ poll, and it’s not close appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Publisher to capitalize on new Digital Markets Act\nMicrosoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has revealed the publisher's plans to open its own in-house app store, selling and distributing games and other software directly to mobile devices.\nSpeaking to The Financial Times, Spencer noted that the EU's incoming Digital Markets Act — new legislation that will force carriers such as Apple and Google to allow third-party app stores to operate on the iOS and Android service — will offer Microsoft the opportunity to distribute its wares directly, rather than through current conglomerate app stores.\n\"We want to be in a position to offer Xbox and content from both us and our third-party partners across any screen where somebody would want to play,\" said Spencer in the interview. \"Today, we can't do that on mobile devices but we want to build towards a world that we think will be coming where those devices are opened up.\"\n\"The Digital Markets Act that's coming — those are the kinds of things [Microsoft is] planning for... I think it's a huge opportunity.\"\nSpencer also referenced the potential for Xbox Game Pass and cloud gaming services to appear in the hypothetical new store. Microsoft is, of course, hoping to get its hands on some of today's most popular mobile titles, including Call of Duty Mobile and Candy Crush Saga, through its intended acquisition of Activision Blizzard — an acquisition that still remains a long, long way from completion. The deadline for the EU Commission to decide whether or not it approves the merger has been delayed to May 22, but this remains one of numerous hurdles Microsoft must clear before the proposed purchase can be closed.\nMicrosoft plans mobile games app store to rival Apple and Google [Financial Times]\nThe post Microsoft planning to launch in-house mobile app store appeared first on Destructoid.",

While a demo of the game has been available since September 2022, the team is ready to take the next step in offering it to FPS fans.\nInspired by E.Y.E. Divine Cybermancy and Deus Ex, Fortune’s Run incorporates “undertones” of role-playing. To differentiate itself from other retro-styled FPS games, Fortune’s Run touts a unique and deep melee system that has you memorizing combos and learning their intricacies. The game will take you through “seedy dives” and distant space stations. The trailer also shows off a lot of environmental hazards to take down enemies with, inviting you to \"kill with your imagination.\"\nhttps://youtu.be/S3fenLLhMIo\nMost importantly to me, the trailer touts that you can “hack a mainframe” using terminal commands. Terminal commands make me feel like a boss. Every modern console should make you jam some esoteric code into a command line to start up your games, just for that shot of accomplishment serotonin.\nThe retro-inspired shooter genre has become rather glutted these days, making it really important to stand out from the crowd. Fortune’s Run looks to be doing just that by wearing its influences on its sleeve while still bringing a heavy dose of personality and experimentation. Down with texture filtering. A hail the grainy, pixellated textures!\nA demo for Fortune’s Run is available now, with the game slated for Steam Early Access in September.\nThe post Retro-styled FPS Fortune’s Run combos Early Access September 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

A top-tier culinary master, Venba's faithful cookbook — containing generations of family recipes, is damaged in transit, and it is up to the player to guide Venba's hand as she attempts to replicate each and every recipe from the tome, while perhaps discovering a few new dishes while en route.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fM6qjSc-G2w&ab_channel=VenbaGame\nBut Venba will be more than a simple cooking game, as a strong, familial narrative will unfold within the family, with the player becoming involved in branching conversations between Venba, her husband, and their young son. Visai Games will blend interesting and compelling puzzle work with lovingly stylish visuals and heartfelt family interaction to create a narrative title that will warm your heart as well as your stomach.

Lars made his debut in Tekken 6, and has been touting his self-righteous sense of justice ever since.\nThe illegitimate son of series veteran Heihachi Mishima, I’m not seeing the resemblance. He’s the leader of a rebel splinter group of the Tekken Force, Yggdrasil, and has been one of the main protagonists for both Tekken 6 and Tekken 7. Given his headlining status, he was pretty much a total shoo-in for the newest iteration.\nhttps://youtu.be/gIt9kFe5QX4\nThe trailer shows Lars throwing down against big cyborg, Jack-8, as well as his half-brother and fellow coat-haver Kazuma Mishima. To highlight his skill of fighting in a long coat, he’s shown effortlessly dispatching the competition using all manner of glowing kicks. His choice of fancy white clothing shows his confidence, not only in his fighting ability but also in his eating ability. True bravery.\nLars Alexandersson joins Bandai Namco’s growing collection of character trailers that have previously covered Jin Kazama, Marshall Law, Nina Williams, King, Paul Phoenix, and Kazuya Mishima. That leaves Jun Kazama and Jack-8 still needing their spotlights.\nTekken 8 is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.

The new range of NFTs is expected to form the base for a future release of further \"metaverse avatars\"\n\"During my time as a director at Sega, I initially developed Virtua Fighter using innovative 3D computer graphics technology, which was cutting-edge and industry-leading at the time,\" said Suzuki in a statement. \"Since then, the Virtua Fighter series has grown to be loved by many players and continues to be supported by numerous fans today.\"\n\"Through my work supervising the development of OASYX’s unique worldview, I am delighted to combine innovative technology in the form of blockchain-based NFTs, with three titles from the Virtua Fighter series to create new entertainment for a wide range of gaming fans.\"\nSega has been practically salivating at the prospect of diving into the metaverse, while simultaneously attempting to assure fans that it is wary of the controversial blockchain technology. As is the case with many other toe-dippers in recent months, both Sega and Suzuki seem completely unperturbed by the market's inability to find consistent success, demonstrated by the complete collapse of cryptocurrency company FTX, the embarrassment of Meta, the dropping Google Search numbers, or fan anger displayed towards Ubisoft, Square Enix, and other studios getting on board the rocket to nowheresville.\nYu Suzuki is working on a range of Virtua Fighter NFTs [VGC]\nThe post Yu Suzuki planning to launch Virtua Fighter NFT range appeared first on Destructoid.",

This sandbox puzzle game is looking to release next year.\nCasting you as the titular half-headed Henry, Henry Halfhead gives you the ability to possess objects. The trailer demonstrates Henry possessing a pair of safety scissors to slice up an apple, which is impressive. I could never even cut craft paper with those. My second thought is wondering if I could jam those scissors into an electrical socket.\nhttps://youtu.be/_tQWiIscf34\nHenry Halfhead will have you play out the life of a person with only half a head, from making your bed in the morning to (I presume) feeding the ducks on a park bench. You expand and unlock new levels by solving puzzles and interacting with objects. The developer is touting over 150 interactive objects that you can tinker around with. There’s also a co-op mode, if you’d like to partner with your other half. Oh, and you can also put hats on Henry, which is pretty key.\nLululu Entertainment (I’m glad I’m just writing that and not saying it out loud) has only developed one game previous to this, the competitive, stick-flinging title Bamerang. Henry Halfhead is quite the departure from that style, but from the looks of things, it’s shaping up pretty well. It’s hard not to dig the crisp visual style they’re showing off.\nCurrently, PC is the only announced platform for Henry Halfhead.

Aliens: Dark Descent is a real-time strategy title and will task the player with efficiently equipping, maneuvering, and affording their troops with the tactical advantage over hordes of Warriors, Face Huggers, Queens, and, of course, the soul-sucking capitalism of Weyland-Yutani. XCOM in the Alien universe? Eh, more or less.\nYou can check out a new trailer below, courtesy of IGN.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YilVs3-B42k&ab_channel=IGN\nAs the trailer spotlights, Dark Descent is not just another bug hunt, as players will also have to ensure that their squad is well-trained, well-maintained, and afforded some of the greatest weaponry that researchers can provide. The Xenomorphs will almost always have the speed and number advantage, so the marines will have to play the field a little wiser — setting up traps, pinpointing enemy movement, and heading into battle well-equipped for the nightmare that lies ahead.\nAs we all know, the Alien franchise has had a real rollercoaster ride when it comes to video games, but I think the visuals here are looking pretty authentic, and it will be great to head into the acid-dripping universe from a perspective that isn't first-person. There's no sign of Lt. Vasquez, or Lynn Kurosawa for that matter, but this new take looks promising, and here's hoping that it delivers come June.\nBut besides all of that, I only need to know one thing...

          "description": "No way home\nRespawn and Electronic Arts have shared the latest trailer for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, with a spotlight on the story. And it seems like a rough road ahead for Cal and pals.\nSurvivor takes place five years after the events of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, with Cal now searching for a safe haven. He might be a more powerful Jedi than ever before, but the Empire doesn't seem too happy to let the conflict lie.\nToday's trailer shows Cal fighting even more Empire troops, with some intimidating foes showing up. But Kestis also looks like he'll have a bit more help around this time, too.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_F6YBwIPzmk\nAlongside some new faces, we do catch one familiar one sporting a new look. As Respawn confirms, Merrin is returning for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, with a new style and apparently assisting Cal in thinning out the Empire's ranks.\nA place beyond the stars\nWhen it landed in 2019, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order was a bit of a surprise. A single-player, action-adventure Star Wars game from the studio that had, up to that point, worked on games like Titanfall and Apex Legends, with God of War's Stig Asmussen on to direct.\nThe result really worked though, as it received a positive critical reception and sold enough to make EA happy. Even as someone a little bit jaded with current Star Wars, I enjoyed the mobility and tense lightsaber action. It's nice to see some of that action still at the fore in this latest Star Wars Jedi: Survivor trailer.\nI'm definitely curious to see if Respawn can bottle (Force) lightning twice. And boy, has this release date snuck up on me, too. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on April 28.\nThe post Star Wars Jedi: Survivor shows a search for safe haven in latest trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

You should map \"looking around\" and \"walking\" to two different sticks because we look around and walk at the same time. You should put \"shoot\" on a trigger because it feels a bit like pulling the trigger on a gun. You should not have your character stop in place every time they ready their gun, because holding a gun does not incapacitate the legs.\nAnd yet, Resident Evil 4, among the most celebrated action games ever made, breaks every one of these rules.

          "description": "Apex Legends continues to grow, and so does Respawn\nRespawn is opening a new branch in Madison, Wisconsin, the company announced today. This latest addition may work on other projects in the future, but at least right now, it will be focusing on supporting Apex Legends.\nFormer Epic games director of engine production Ryan Burnett is taking up the role of studio director. He also had 14 years with Raven Software. The Madison branch is working closely with the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation as well, to help grow the studio.\nRespawn opened a support studio for Apex Legends in Vancouver back in 2019. With this new studio, it sounds like Electronic Arts and Respawn want to keep the battle royale growing. From a GamesIndustry.biz interview with the new studio leads, Burnett says that the branch is not a remote live ops department, but an expansion of the core Apex team that will work with the studios in LA and Vancouver.\nThe battle rages on\nThree locales is a lot, but it sounds like Respawn has big plans for Apex Legends, especially when it comes to longevity. Responding to a question about crunch and quality-of-life, game director Steven Ferreira talks about just how long-haul the development of Apex goes.\n\"Team health is absolutely a top priority for us because we're in this for the long haul,\" Ferreira said. \"We believe in Apex as a franchise that's going to be around for 10, 15 years or more and we're excited to make that happen. In order to do that, we can't just put everything all upfront, burn ourselves out and not be ready to do that in the long haul.\"\nThat's a long time, but as online game after online game has closed, Apex Legends has indeed weathered the storm. Maybe this battle royale does have a long future ahead of it. God willing, that will include some more Titanfall somewhere down the line.\nThe post Respawn opens new studio to bolster Apex Legends development appeared first on Destructoid.",

But back in December, PlayStation did reveal that Marvel's Spider-Man 2 would be out sometime this Fall. \nAccording to the voice actor for Venom in the game, Tony Todd (who we heard briefly in the game's reveal trailer), Marvel's Spider-Man 2 will be out this September. Strangely, Todd responded to a fan excited about the game and spilled the beans. \n \nLooks like September! Massive publicity coming in august. Commercials start dropping in august so I’m told. Hold on to your … and hold breath! Gonna be necessary\nMarch 21, 2023\nSure seems like information Todd wasn't supposed to reveal, right? Despite what you might think, though, Todd's tweet is still up at the time of this writing, meaning Insomniac Games hasn't made him take it down (yet). \nOnce people started to realize that Todd had potentially revealed Marvel's Spider-Man 2's release date, he cheekily tweeted the following: \nNo more hints about #Spiderman2 it was all a fever dream Blame it on jet lag who knows I might not even b #Venom pic.twitter.com/dKf1EsLFwQ\nMarch 21, 2023\nNow, it's important to note that just because Todd says the game is coming this September doesn't mean it actually is. We should remain cautious about an official release date or release month until it comes from developer Insomniac Games. But September lines up with the previously revealed Fall window.\nA September release date would put this big PlayStation first-party launch up against Xbox's big first-party launch in Starfield (September 6) so this Fall could be quite busy. \nDo you think Marvel's Spider-Man 2 will launch in September?

This beta will feature Crash Bandicoot, Coco Bandicoot, Tawna Bandicoot, Doctor Neo Cortex, and Dingodile. \n\n\nThe game will cost $29.99 but a deluxe edition for $39.99 will also be available. Crash Team Rumble will also include a battle pass and both editions include the first season's pass. The deluxe edition will also include the Season 2 battle pass, a free 25-tier boost for Season 1, and the digital proto pack, which brings \"Blocky\" skins to the game alongside some equippable items, according to VGC. \nPreviews released today mention three different roles in Crash Team Rumble: Booster, Blocker, and Scorer. Using these three roles in a MOBA-like fashion, players will need to collect as much Wumpa Fruit as possible and bring it to their zone. If you've played 2021's Pokemon Unite, you probably get the gist here. \n\nCrash Team Rumble will feature crossplay. It is being developed by Toys for Bob, the team that developed the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy collection and Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time. \nWhile waiting for Crash Team Rumble to release in June, read Game Informer's Crash Bandicoot N.

          "description": "Last November, Game Freak released Pokémon Scarlet and Violet on Switch. The game quickly became one of the top-selling games in the history of the popular console, and now, it's time for the new generation to kick off within the popular Pokémon Trading Card Game. The inaugural Pokémon Scarlet & Violet expansion does more than just introduce the ninth generation of Pokémon into the TCG; it also implements a whole host of changes, not the least of which is a higher price tag for most items. \nHowever, along with that price increase come several benefits, including a new guarantee of three foil cards in every booster pack, plus the introduction of the silver border in the U.S. and other quality-of-life improvements with regards to the designs. The Pokémon Company sent over several booster packs for us to crack open and see what we could pull. While I was less frequently blown away by the big cards I pulled, this is one of the most robust galleries of \"the coolest cards\" articles I've done in a great many expansions. Partially, that is due to me enjoying seeing some of the newer Pokémon from Gen IX getting their first cards, but I can't help but think the increase in foil cards was to thank.\nIn total, the Pokémon Scarlet & Violet expansion introduces more than 190 new cards, including more than 10 new Pokémon ex cards, more than 30 Trainer cards, new Tera Pokémon, and tons of special-illustration Pokémon and Trainer cards. You can see the coolest cards we pulled from this expansion in the gallery below:\n\n Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet is available starting on March 31.

Atari simply says it has acquired a \"dozen retro arcade games\" so it's likely the other 10 properties are from the same era of arcade games as Berzerk and Frenzy. \n\"Atari...announced today the acquisition of a dozen retro arcade games, including the '80s classics Berzerk and Frenzy,\" the press release reads. \"Atari will seek to expand digital and physical distribution of the classic titles, create new games based on the IPs, and explore brand and merchandising collaborations.\"\nAtari says Berzerk is \"a top-down, multidirectional shooter designed by Alan McNeil that was released for arcades in 1980.\" It's perhaps best known for being the first arcade video game with speech synthesis. Following its arcade release, Berzerk was ported to the Atari 2600 and Atari 5200 by the console maker. Frenzy is actually a sequel to Berzerk first released in 1982. \n\"Berzerk is one of those foundational games that so many people first encountered playing on an Atari console,\" Atari CEO Wade Rosen writes in the press release. \"Berzerk, and the other titles included in this acquisition, are a perfect fit for our strategy of commercializing classic retro IP.\"\nWho knows if we'll learn what the other 10 retro arcade properties Atari has acquired are – only time will tell.

Presumably, people have been speculating that the game might come to Game Pass as Blizzard Entertainment and Xbox are close to teaming up by way of Microsoft's pending acquisition of Activision Blizzard. \nIt's awesome seeing the excitement around the Diablo IV Beta, and our Wolf Pack puppy! We’ve been getting some questions about D4 on Game Pass and I want to let you know we have no plans for that. See you in Sanctuary during the Beta Early Access weekend starting on March 17!\nMarch 13, 2023\nAs you can see in Fergusson's tweet above, there's no plans for Diablo IV to come to Game Pass. But Diablo IV is out June 6; perhaps there's time for plans to change (although I'm not betting on it, personally). \nIn the meantime, if you preorder the game, you can hop into a closed beta starting tomorrow, March 17. That closed period runs until March 19 and then starting March 24, there will be an open beta that anyone can jump into.

Dinosaurs have also begun appearing all over the globe through mysterious wormholes, so our heroes strap into their weaponized exosuits to deal with that very strange problem. \n\n\nAs a cooperative team-based multiplayer game, Exoprimal is an always-online experience and will feature season passes with a number of unlockable rewards, such as cosmetics. Those itching to try the game early can jump into a free open beta that runs March 17 to 19, but you'll need to register for a Capcom ID to play. Exoprimal will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC. It will also launch on Xbox Game Pass.",

          "description": "This year our project was accepted to the Google Summer of Code program for the eighth year in a row (and 16th time in total).\nThe intention of the program is to bring new contributors to open source projects, and the eligibility rules for participants are the same as last year, with both students and non-students welcome to participate. Check the  Google Summer of Code website for details of eligibility.\nParticipants can apply for either short tasks (about 175 hours) or long tasks (about 350 hours). The coding period typically runs from the start of June to the end of August, but there is some flexibility and the participants can opt to use a longer coding period if they are not available to work full time on the project during the summer.\nScummVM is looking for applicants! A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we’re open to your own ideas too. Please make sure you provide the required information in your application before submitting. We also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server and follow the #scummvm-gsoc channel where you can engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, and get advice and help on getting started with the project and writing your application.\nWe have gathered some information to guide you, based on our previous 15 years of experience in the program. You may start your exploration from our Google Summer of Code miniportal.\nWe are looking forward to your application and participation!\n>",
