          "description": "Some resolution.\nThe announcement of a Switch remake of the beloved SNES game Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars set many a nostalgic heart racing during the June 2023 Nintendo Direct, and sharp-eyed gamers have noted that the upcoming return of Square's 16-bit classic will bring some previously blurry elements into much sharper focus. In fact, it's now possible to spot cameo appearances from other Nintendo characters that were difficult to discern back in 1996.\nOn current evidence (check out the trailer at the bottom of the page if you'd like a reminder), the modernised art style is being used to sensitively adapt the original isometric visuals for modern hi-res displays, and @BridgeOfFaust on Twitter noticed a cameo from none other than Diskun in the new trailer. Playdate's Cabel Sasser noted a potential nod to Stunt Race FX beside the Japan-only Famicom Disk System mascot, too:\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

One would think that such a legendary release would spawn a broader franchise, yet it never got a proper sequel, and Meat Boy only recently received another starring role in Super Meat Boy Forever, an auto-runner that failed to come anywhere close to matching the legendary status of his first game. Now Headup Development is trying with Dr. Fetus’ Mean Meat Machine, a Puyo Puyo-style falling block puzzler that focused heavily on crushing difficulty. It has its charms, but this is ultimately another middling new release for Meat Boy.\nTaking place after the events of Super Meat Boy Forever, Dr. Fetus’ Mean Meat Machine places you in the role of the youthful villain as he sets up a lab and attempts to make the perfect clone of Meat Boy. Unfortunately, the DNA sample that he has is flawed, resulting in thousands of imperfect clones which are of no use to him. He thus puts the clones through a literal meat grinder, slowly weeding out the weak and imperfect ones while the best clones evolve and gradually become closer to the real deal.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Shown off at this year's Summer Game Fest showcase, Sand Land is an upcoming RPG from the folks over at Ilca Inc, the developers of One Piece Odyssey, and the creator of Dragon Ball, Akira Toriyama. It's an adaptation on one of Toriyama's lesser-known mangas, which features a band of misfits who aim to right the wrongs of a king who's hogged the desert's vital water supply. I got to play it for all of 20 minutes, in a demo that was as stripped back as a grated cactus. Still, I got to sample a bit of roaming about in a tank, one brief stop at a town, an opening of one (1) chest, and some fighting. It seemed okay, I guess? But my main worry is whether its desert is interesting enough to hold people's attention.\nRead more",

          "description": "Stop me if you've heard this one before: the RTX 4060 Ti just came out but you should probably buy the RTX 3060 Ti instead. It's around 85 to 90 percent of the performance at less than 70 percent of the cost - although you do give up better power efficiency and DLSS 3 on the newer model. \nWe've highlighted a few UK RTX 3060 Ti deals before, but here's one for the US market courtesy of Best Buy - on a PNY unit with a simple dual-fan design, plenty of cooling potential and a price that makes a lot of sense: $275, down from a previous price of $320 and considerably less than the $399 Nvidia is asking for their 4060 Ti FE. \nRead more",

This makes it a better time to buy this particular item than times when it is more expensive, generally speaking. \nThe specifics are as follows: the Sapphire Pulse Radeon RX 7900 XTX has been discounted from $1000 to $900 in the US (tick the $100 code on the product page), while Sapphire's AMD reference design has dropped from £1099 to £949 in the UK (no ticking required). \nRead more",

But as he pulled away, he caught a snippet of our conversation that was so unusual it's the reason this seemingly normal car ride has cemented itself as a core memory. We were talking about the price of eggs. And tomatoes. And the order in which we were planting crops to ensure the greatest yield.\r\n\n\r\nMy poor father interrupted us, turning in his seat to ask what the hell we were talking about. “It’s a game we’re both playing called Harvest Moon” I scoffed in his direction. “You wouldn’t understand”.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It’s the first to really capture the white-knuckle vibe of setting up perimeters, quipping out that last line of top-tier banter you’ve been saving, and seeing the shapes on the motion tracker creep closer and squeal louder. It really does do the license justice, so if that’s what you’re looking for, dig in. I just wish it trusted me to be able to count higher than one. Not that much higher, either. Just four.\nDark Descent is not a game for strategy game fans nearly as much as it’s one for Aliens fans. You order your entire squad around at the same time, pausing or slowing time to issue commands like grenades or suppressive fire, using a stock of command points that refill over time. It’s a game that’s (rightly) decided that a very particular type of strategy game is the best format to convey Aliens’ whole schtick, but then seems to have realised, hang on, we’re at risk of (alien) isolating and possibly even (alien)ating a lot of potential customers here.

Tales & Tactics, in case you’ve forgotten, is best pitched as a mixture of Slay the Spire and Dota Auto Chess; in other words, it’s a fantasy roguelike (like StS), where you can pick up abilities, gear and whatnot during each run, with auto-battling combat (like Auto Chess) - except here it’s on a hex board.\r\n\n \nRead more",

You can view the entire June Next Fest line-up right here if you'd rather browse at your leisure, but we've also been playing some of the demos in advance to bring you some curated highlights of what we've enjoyed so far. We haven't have access to every demo in this year's Next Fest, I should note, but think of these more as some initial tasting suggestions to get you started, rather than a complete overview of what's worth playing.  \nRead more",

It's true that higher-end models offer more features and can support better overclocking performance, but for the vast majority of people you're better off putting your budget towards the highest-tier graphics card and processor you can afford - as these actually determine in-game performance! - then slotting in the cheapest motherboard that gets decent reviews and supports your components. \nOne excellent example of just such a motherboard is the Gigabyte B760M Gaming X DDR4, a simple option that supports 12th/13th-gen Intel processors all the way up to the 13900K. With an asking price of just £116 right now, you can pick up this plus a cheap 16GB DDR4 RAM kit for just £152, letting you spend the vast majority of your PC budget where it really matters. \nRead more",

It's an adventure game with quick-time event bits, and a 50s America setting, all of which could put me off it entirely, but I can't bring myself to say anything bad about it at all.\nRead more",

Wasn't I only delighted, then, to play a bit of Galacticare, an upcoming hospital management sim in the same sticky vein as the hospitals Theme or Two Point. The twist? These hopsitals are in space! Like those managment games, your task is to build a hospital that runs as smooth as some kind of alien baby's bottom (the alien probably has tentacles), where you want to treat people and prevent them from dying as much as possible, but largely because death is bad for your profit margin more than any altruistic impulse. I mean you can be altruistic if you want, I suppose, but if you run out of money it's harder to build more weird bone-fixing machines.\nThe tone - though Galacticare has strange diseases like being eaten from the inside out by a singularity, and wacky treatments including a sort of laser disco machine - is actually much closer to kind of satire-ish hijinks of spacestation management game Startopia than I had expected, thanks in part to the extremely dry AI helper offering input, and the many alien species who'll come to you for treatment.\nRead more",

What happened before that point is never really interrogated during Dordogne's three-hour run time, but we do know her father is a stubborn old goat who cut ties with Mimi's really quite nice grandmother Nora after a summer she spent there as a shy, sheltered twelve-year-old. It's this summer that seems to be the cork in Mimi's memory bottle, and it's also the window in which Dordogne frames its sweet, coming of age tale. As Mimi in the present comes to terms with her grandmother's recent passing, the objects she finds in Nora's now-empty summer house trigger important flashbacks to that golden summer, and maybe also the answer to Mimi's apparent amnesia. Dordogne never demands very much of you during these sequences, but it does know how to luxuriate in life's little details, and find pleasure in a more leisurely lifestyle.\nRead more",

But having played a 30 minute demo of it this week, I reckon it's nothing like COD at all, really. Instead, it's more like Doom / your other retro shooter of choice, but one that carries itself with a frightening seriousness. Sometimes, that's fine. There have been plenty of these smaller sorts of blockbusters that have successfully struck the right balance of silly to serious, with the best ascending to a place of endearment.

The ceilings are too low, the stairs too narrow, the pipes an afterthought. Jagged Alliance 2 isn't that far gone, but it’s getting there. It gives lots of options for fine control but using them is largely gated behind esoteric, repetitive keyboard shortcuts, which get doubly cumbersome during its awkward transitional moments between real and turn-based movement. \nIt's about leading a group of mercenaries to overthrow the tyrannical queen of a fictional island. A guerrilla warfare sim with great strategic freedom and probably the best turn-based tactical combat ever, all buoyed away from self-seriousness by a campy, irreverent tone and intentionally over the top characters.\nWhat I'm saying is: it's still worth it.\nRead more",

Build rides to attract crowds, shops to fill their stupid mouths, doctors to treat the vomitous and cleaners when the doctors were too late. Punters pay to use any ride, they pay for entry, for toilets and cash machines, and for every item you price in every shop.\nThat's as close as it gets to micromanagement, unless you count finely tuning the position of every rock, shrub, and decorative roof panel. It's more Planet Coaster than the cynical money grubbing of Theme Park, so if you're here for rollercoasters that do stunt jumps over canyons, it's mostly good news.\nRead more",

But I was also keen to find out whether they considered this a reboot for the series, or whether it had any connection to the Sands Of Time trilogy, and game director Mounir Radi was happy to oblige. For him and his team, it's first and foremost \"a whole new chapter\" in the series, although you could call it a prequel, if you really wanted to. Whatever you do, though, don't call it a reboot.

When it was first announced on Sunday, we knew very little about the game other than it looks very pretty, and we've been eager to know more ever since. The game also opened Capcom's own showcase the next day, where the same trailer was shown and we didn't get any new information on it. Very enlightening.

          "description": "LA is an amazing, if tremendously grey place. Everywhere you go, there are grey skyscrapers touching the clouds, so they all look like the concrete's puffing on numerous cigarettes. More often than not, cracked paving gives way to an empty lot or a vacuous car park, often with one guy slumped in a little booth ensuring it stays as grey as possible. So, what better way to commemorate grey than with a look at its president, Armored Core 6: Fires Of Rubicon?\nHaving seen a 20 minute presentation of the game at this year's Summer Game Fest, I'd say it struck me as an action game through and through, with the most recognisable bits of Souls soldered onto it when it came to, say, tough battles set to erratic rhythms. Honestly, I would say the hands-off demo is exactly what I expected it to be: lots of fast bits of metal slamming into each other in what was, perhaps, the least surprising FromSoftware reveal I've seen. Here's a piecemeal, slightly chaotic breakdown of the whole experience, coming to you from the frazzled mind of a jetlagged man sitting at a wobbly table.\nRead more",

          "description": "Five years of interconnected adventure\nSquare Enix has announced that it will hold a special anniversary live stream next month to celebrate five years of the narrative adventure franchise Octopath Traveler. The stream will take place on July 13, the same date as the first title graced its presence on Nintendo Switch.\nDeveloped by Square Enix and Acquire, the Octopath Traveler titles allow players to follow the interconnecting tales of a party of distinct protagonists, who cross paths under their own respective circumstances. Octopath Traveler and its recent sequel, Octopath Traveler II, have garnered devoted fanbases due to their traditional RPG nature, interesting characters, and artistically impressive worlds. The second title has sold over one million copies since its February launch on PC and consoles.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exUzGmKmr60\nProduced in alignment with Weekly Famitsu, the live stream will feature guests such as Square Enix producer Masashi Takahashi, Acquire lead Keisuke Miyauchi, and series composer Yasunori Nishiki. The stream will include interviews, a retrospective, and the results of a recently held Japanese fan survey. As to whether we can expect any reveals... Well, a sequel literally arrived less than six months ago, so any new titles or spin-offs seem unlikely. But perhaps Square Enix will have something interesting to show fans.\nThe Octopath Traveler Anniversary Stream will take place July 13 at 20:00 JST, which is a red-eyed 04:00 in PT times. If there is any news, we will be sure to keep you abreast of it.\nOctopath Traveler II is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch.\nOctopath Traveler 5th Anniversary Live Stream set for July 13 [Gematsu]\nThe post Octopath Traveler anniversary live stream set for July appeared first on Destructoid.",

The two cars featured are the \"1956 Barbie Movie Corvette EV\", (featured in the Chevrolet section), and the \"2022 Barbie Movie Hummer EV Pickup\", (featured under GMC). Videos of the vehicles in Showcase Mode were later uploaded by another Forza devotee, Aziial.\nNo dates for the drop have been announced, so it is assumed the two *electric vehicles will arrive as free downloads or in-game rewards to cross-promote the movie itself, which premieres July 21.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wN7qCE4uI_s\nDirected by Greta Gerwig, Barbie follows the adventures of the titular doll, as she and her long-time pal Ken (Ryan Gosling) leave Barbieland to visit the \"real world\" and get a taste of reality. A huge ensemble cast includes Simu Liu, Kate McKinnon, Will Ferrell, Michael Cera, America Ferrara, Issa Rae, and Helen Mirren. Response to recent trailers has been extremely positive, and all that's left is the waiting game before we find out with the talent both in front of and behind the lens can live up to the hype.\nForza Horizon 5 is available now on PC and Xbox platforms.

          "description": "No more random flatlining\nAh, Cyberpunk 2077. What a road you've been down. From one of the most disastrous launches in recent gaming history to an enjoyable dystopian RPG from the people that brought us The Witcher. CD Projekt Red has been doing what it can to make its open-world title the product it should have been at the start, and the latest update has been rolling out.\nPatch 1.63 for Cyberpunk 2077 comes with a host of tweaks and fixes, as all good patches should. In this instance, particular attention has been paid to some of the game's quests. For example, there's been a fix for the \"All Along the Watchtower\" and \"I Walk the Line\" missions, in which V could randomly flat line.\n\nThere's also been some fixes for some of the side quests (known as \"gigs\"), including \"Guinea Pigs,\" \"Bloodsport,\" \"On a Tight Leash,\" and more. The patch also puts a band-aid on some issues with the UI and makes improvements for DLSS Frame Generation, specifically for those running the game on AMD processors. The patch notes on Steam give a better idea of just how much has been fixed for version 1.63.\nIt's clear that Cyberpunk still has a few problems, but then what release doesn't these days? Hell, Skyrim is still one of the most popular RPGs of the last decade, and that title's so loaded with bugs that it's pretty much become a meme at this point.\nAlongside these changes, many of you are anticipating Cyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty DLC, which is set to release on September 26. There's also a follow-up that CD Projekt Red announced in 2022, but that's far off into the future. Hopefully, CDPR has learned a lot from Cyberpunk 2077's notorious launch before diving into sequel development.\nThe post New Cyberpunk 2077 patch fixes multiple issues with questlines appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Yay or neigh?\nCygames revealed Umamusume Pretty Derby: Nekketsu Hachamecha Dai Kasha-sai as part of Japan’s Nintendo Direct yesterday, but there was little indication of its release plans. The publisher has now confirmed that the game will be coming to North America as Umamusume: Pretty Derby – Party Dash.\nThe pixel art visuals are cute, but what grabbed my attention is the obvious nods to the Nekketsu/Kunio-Kun series. There are four events in this party Grand Prix: Hurtling Hurdles, Blazing Baskets, Dodgeball Demolition, and Gourmet Gauntlet. Alliterations are fun. Three of those events bear a resemblance to games in the Kunio-Kun series. In particular, the Blazing Baskets game has three nets stacked on top of each other, which was part of Nekketsu Street Basket.\nhttps://youtu.be/M8SzQG-VLjU\nHomage aside, it’s definitely not just a straight copy. There are a lot of new things mixed in with these games, like turning someone into a penguin for some reason. Collectibles of some sort are on the playing field. It looks like all events are a free-for-all. There actually isn’t a whole lot to go on in this press release, but I think the trailer speaks for itself.\nWe’re promised a “star-studded cast of Umamusume to play as.” I don’t know what that means beyond them being horse girls. I’m going to be honest with you, I know nothing about Umamusume. This is actually the first time I’ve heard of it. I do watch anime from time to time, but it’s part of a very sparse likelihood that I’ll watch a TV show at all. This trailer doesn’t really get me interested in the show, but the game looks fun.\nUmamusume: Pretty Derby – Party Dash is coming to PS4, Switch, and PC sometime in 2024.\nThe post Umamusume: Pretty Derby – Party Dash is galloping westward in 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

While it's unlikely that the game will let you \"hang ten\" (or whatever) while exploring alien worlds, you can still pull some moves with a skateboard themed on the game.\nOver on the Bethesda website, if you wish to relive those glory days of the Tony Hawk games you can pick up an \"aerial skate deck\" while you wait for Starfield to come out. Featuring the logo and artwork inspired by the upcoming game, the item itself does not actually come with wheels. But don't worry. The site says you can still hang it on your wall.\n[caption id=\"attachment_388074\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"450\"] Image via Bethesda.[/caption]\nThis is just one of many Starfield paraphernalia objects that you can buy (so long as it's in stock), such as a journal, \"constellation\" jacket, desk mat, and, of course, a mug. If you do want to pick up the skateboard deck, currently priced at $75, you will need to purchase the wheels and grip tape separately, unless you have some spare lying around.\nMuch of the gaming world is eagerly awaiting the arrival of Starfield. Originally set to release in November 2022, the date was pushed back to sometime in 2023 before a final launch date of September 6 was officially announced by Bethesda.\nIt represents something a little different for the Elder Scrolls and Fallout studio, so a lot of people are curious to see what Todd Howard and his team have been working on these past few years.

Now, the story has reached the gaming world, as the indie horror title Iron Lung has seen its sales increase in the wake of the real-world incident.\nAccording to developer David Szymanski over on Twitter (via PC Gamer) there's been a spike in the amount of units that have sold for the creepy, underwater game. Szymanski shows a graph that depicts a significant uptick in sales, right around the time the missing sub became huge news in global media. This would suggest that the story of the missing occupants onboard the submersible has inspired some to buy Iron Lung.\nhttps://twitter.com/DUSKdev/status/1671498543771574273\nFor those who don't know, Iron Lung is a small horror game that tasks you with investigating mysterious goings-on underwater. You're placed inside a cramped, iron vessel that takes you to the depths of an alien ocean, with nothing but ominous sounds and grainy pictures to keep you company. It was actually one of our Top 10 pics of 2022.\nHowever, the fact that people are now buying the game in the wake of the missing Titan could be seen as poor taste by some. In fact, the developer has said, in response to someone on Twitter, that they \"feel kinda uncomfortable\" about the rise in Iron Lung's popularity. One person made a comment about not being sure whether they'd be \"honored or horrified\" by what's been happening, though Szymanski says they are \"pretty horrified.\"\nAt the time of writing, the Titan sub, which went missing on June 18, has still not been located. Additional search and rescue teams are still looking for the vessel as well as its five occupants.\nThe post Iron Lung sales increase in wake of missing Titan sub, dev feels ‘uncomfortable’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Well, pluck me running\nThe Wild Gentlemen and Joystick Ventures have announced that the Chicken Police are returning in Chicken Police: Into the Hive. It’s currently set for release sometime in 2024.\nI didn’t play Chicken Police: Paint it RED when it was released in 2020, but did pick it up the following year. It was fantastic. I may have missed its review window, but I still ended up praising it high-and-low in a later article. While the first game stuck to its noir trappings, it was a strangely optimistic story that left me with good feels, even while its narrative was decidedly dark. While it has a strange veneer, it also presents an intriguing world that I’m excited to see further explored.\nhttps://youtu.be/Alt5JsimUbY\nWhile Chicken Police: Into the Hive’s trailer is somewhat lacking in specifics, the Hive was explained in the previous game. It’s essentially an area where the city of Clawville sends its unwanted, which is a slightly more generous way of saying that it's a slum for insects. Manny expresses regret that the population was treated so unfairly, but the area isn’t really explored beyond that in the first game.\nThis makes the Hive a fertile ground for storytelling in Chicken Police: Into the Hive. Again, the trailer only gives hints of what it’s going to cover, but it depicts a cold-blooded murder and unrest in the streets.\n[caption id=\"attachment_386194\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via The Wild Gentlemen[/caption]\nMoreover, it shows a return of the unique mix of photo-manipulation and anthropomorphic animal characters that helped the first game stand out. I’m so jazzed for this. I can barely contain all my jazz.\nUnfortunately, I’ll need to keep a lid on my jazz until 2024, which is when Chicken Police: Into the Hive is expected to launch on PC.\nThe post Chicken Police: Into the Hive brings the partners back for another finger-lickin’ mystery appeared first on Destructoid.",

It doesn't seem like there's any wiggle room here, as Konami notes \"to enjoy all available content, game data must be downloaded (free),\" and an \"internet connection is required.\" The site even recommends a microSD card off the bat.\nThe bit of good news, which is actually kinda-sorta false hope, is that these download sizes are \"tentative\" and \"will be finalized by September 2023.\" Sorry, it's not actually good news, but you deserve some hope.\nAll of the Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Switch download sizes: What's on the cart?\nPhysical Version : 24.1GB ( *Front loaded onto cartridge 2.4GB )\nMetal Gear Solid- Master Collection Version : 4.8GB\nexcl.

          "description": "QuakeCon announcement incoming?\nEverybody's favorite spoiler, The Game Rating and Administration Committee of Korea, is at it again, this time apparently lifting the lid on an incoming remaster of one of the most genre-defining shooters of all time, id Software's Quake II.\nWhile Activision is yet to officially announce said remaster, we have been here once before, as game ratings board previously leaked the remaster of the original Quake, ahead of its official reveal at the annual gathering of all things id, QuakeCon. Given that QuakeCon 2023 is set to take place in a little over a month from now, it seems pretty snug that Quake II Remastered is scheduled to make its appearance.\nOriginally released in 1997, at the height of the second major FPS boom, Quake II is a violent, sci-fi shooter that sees top-tier marine Bitterman fend off an entire alien invasion with an arsenal of bombastic weaponry. With its smart, interconnected stages, multiple player characters, and commitment to chaotic destruction, Quake II was highly praised by critics and fans, becoming a mainstay on the early online multiplayer circuit and boosting the Activision coffers long before Call of Duty was even in consideration.\nWe will be sure to give you a heads-up when an official announcement is forthcoming. QuakeCon 2023 takes place at the Gaylord Texan Resort & Convention Center in Grapevine, Texas from August 10-13.\nThe post Quake II Remastered surfaces on Korean Ratings Board appeared first on Destructoid.",

Planned to roll out on August 1, the price increase will apply to most countries apart from the US, Japan, Chile, Brazil, and Colombia. This move practically mirrors Sony's PlayStation 5 price increase that occurred last year.\nAccording to the statement, the Xbox Series X will move to £479.99 in the UK, €549.99 across most European Markets, CAD $649.99 in Canada, and AUD $799.99 in Australia. The Xbox Series S will remain at $299.99 and not see any sort of increase.\n\"We've held on our prices for consoles for many years and have adjusted the prices to reflect the competitive conditions in each market,\" said Kari Perez, head of communications for Xbox in their statement to The Verge.\nXbox Game Pass will see a price increase in most markets\nAlongside the console price increase, the monthly cost of Xbox Game Pass for consoles will also be increasing. This price change will go into effect nearly a month earlier, on July 6. Under these changes, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will increase $2 from $14.99 per month to $16.99. The cost for the base Xbox Game Pass will increase by $1 from $9.99 per month to $10.99. The price of the PC Game Pass will not increase.\nOf course, those already subscribed won't see the price increase until their next subscription renewal on or after July 6.\nAlthough a bummer, I'm not surprised by these increases. Sony increasing the cost of the PlayStation 5 in select markets made it a no-brainer that Microsoft would probably do the same. As for the Xbox Game Pass, I think we all saw this coming. Most entertainment subscriptions have seen an increase in the last year or so including Sony's own PlayStation Plus. Hopefully Nintendo Switch Online won't be following suit!\nThe post Xbox Series X and Xbox Game Pass price increase in some countries appeared first on Destructoid.",

And while the North American Nintendo Direct had a bunch of games to show off, today's Nintendo Direct for Japan also had some surprising, intriguing games on display.\nI try to make a habit of watching the Japanese Nintendo Direct after the North American one airs. For one, it's an interesting way to see how Nintendo organizes these shows for different regions; some games move further up in the rundown, or feel like they get a little more time. And in other cases, some games only show up in certain regions' Directs.

Sonic will also return in Sonic Origins Plus this very Friday.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoyoWlOJILc\nOrigins Plus is a collection that features four classic Sonic games in HD, as well as 12 Sonic games from the Game Gear.

Twitter users are already claiming that the game has been leaked, and fans aren't happy with the quality of the sound of the Game Gear remasters. Twitter user Kirisame states that he has analyzed the audio files and complains that the stereo changes actually make the game sound worse.\nhttps://twitter.com/kirisamemofo/status/1670235195050536961?s=20\nTo learn more about it all and more, stay tuned to Sonic's Twitch or Youtube channels this Friday, June 23, at 8 am PST or 11 am EST.\nThe post Sonic Central stream teasing “upcoming projects” airs on June 23 appeared first on Destructoid.",

While the job is far from over, Season 4 marks another big step forward and we remain committed to this journey with the Halo community.\"\nOf course, 343 Industries was one of the Microsoft subsidiaries that was hit by layoffs at the start of the year, which forces the dedicated Halo team to prioritize its manpower and talent on the core elements of the sci-fi shooter.

Streamers may receive warnings for failing to accurately label their content, with potential blocks for repeat offenders. That said, Twitch also notes that a streamer will not be auto-suspended for mislabelling their channel. You can check out the full details on the new labeling system on Twitch.\nTwitch continues to implement and experiment with rules, guidelines, and features in order to combat explicit content on the website. Of course, given the mammoth nature of the streaming platform, moderation has been a momentous issue for the Twitch team, which has led to false positives, user confusion, and the controversial application, (and sometimes retraction) of security and marketing measures.\nThe post New Twitch labels hope to better classify mature content appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Coming October 20\nTo cap off its Nintendo Direct presentation, the legendary publisher lifted the lid on Super Mario Bros. Wonder, a brand new 2D platform adventure starring the iconic plumber and his friends. The new title will launch on Nintendo Switch on October 20, 2023.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JStAYvbeSHc\nThe trailer featured what, at first, appeared to be some classic 2D Super Mario action, but soon gave way to an elastic and playable world, featuring growing pipes, talking flowers, lanky Goombas, a night-time mode, and various other strange phenomena. The trailer also showcased the \"Wonder Flowers\" — powerups that can change our hero in all manner of ways, from making him taller, to increasing his jump height, and even turning him into an elephant!\nOther characters are playable, including Luigi, Princess Peach, Princess Daisy, and Toad, and while the gameplay seems authentic to the 2D Super Mario style, Super Mario Bros. Wonder looks to play with the world and its characters in ways never before experienced, all daubed in a vibrant, \"cartoon\" visual style. More information will be revealed by Nintendo in the lead-up to the game's launch on October 20.\nThe post Super Mario Bros.

In addition to some excellent RPG news, we've got some info about interesting original titles as well. A prime example of this is Penny's Big Breakaway, a new 3D platformer from the team behind Sonic Mania.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hAgpRYM2M8\nWhile the game itself doesn't have too many similarities to the typical Blue Blur video game, it does promise a speedrun-centric slant with its Time Attack mode. More importantly, we got lots of yo-yo based attacks, which the titular Penny can modify with various snack-based power-ups. We can already find mentions of unlockable bonus items and secret stages, so it looks like this one will lean heavy on replay value.\nFortunately, this title won't be a Nintendo Switch exclusive. Penny's Big Breakaway will launch on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch in Early 2024.\nThe post Penny’s Big Breakaway is a new 3D platformer from Sonic Mania team appeared first on Destructoid.",

Just more amiibo. I'm sure all of you are thrilled.\nNintendo confirmed both Zelda and Ganondorf amiibo figures, which were heavily rumored thanks to some recent datamining efforts. No footage was shown off in terms of what they actually bring to the table digitally, but we did get a good look at the figures themselves, and they are fantastic.\n[gallery link=\"file\" columns=\"2\" size=\"large\" ids=\"387849,387850\"]\nThis dual reveal comes directly after the recent news of Zelda amiibo restocks\nNintendo seems committed to getting a ton of Zelda amiibo back into circulation, as they confirmed prior to the Nintendo Direct that there was going to be a wide restock of old figures. This led to all sorts of speculation that they'd reveal more Tears of the Kingdom amiibo, which turned out to be accurate.\nWe still have the Sages/new Champions too!

Then a character opens their mouth, and the dialogue and how it’s delivered is so cringeworthy that you’re ready to jump ship. Sometimes that’s bad writing. But when we’re talking about a game from a different part of the world, it’s just as likely that questionable localization is the culprit. \nLocalization and translation is difficult. Doing it exceptionally well is exceedingly difficult. Often, minute cultural differences in how storytelling is delivered in different places can add up; in the aggregate, those minor differences can alienate players from another region.

Like Xbox's other first-party releases, Machine Games' Indiana Jones game will also come to PC. \nHowever, Hines also revealed that Disney and Bethesda parent company ZeniMax originally signed an agreement that this Indiana Jones game would be multiplatform, meaning it'd likely also release on PlayStation. Hines says after Microsoft acquired ZeniMax in 2020, the agreement with Disney was amended to transition the Indiana Jones game away from a multiplatform release and instead, into one that will release exclusively on Xbox and PC.\n\n\nToday's court trial also revealed that Xbox head Phil Spencer told Hines that Bethesda should look at title exclusivity on a case-by-case basis, IGN reports. As for why Indiana Jones was transitioned into an exclusive, Hines cited \"reducing risk and trying to get a degree of clarity.\" \n\"You're dealing with a licensor who is giving a ton of feedback on what you're making, is going to add a ton of time to your scheduling, these agreements, you don't get to take as long as you want, you have a window of time in which you're going to release a game, you immediately have a clock that's ticking on you,\" Hines said, according to IGN.\nBethesda revealed Machine Games' Indiana Jones game back in 2021 with a short teaser trailer, and that was the last we've seen of it. However, Bethesda head Todd Howard says he first pitched this Indiana Jones game way back in 2009. There's still no release window for the game today. \n[Source: IGN]\nEditor's Note: The headline has been updated to reflect the game will also come to PC.",

Petey Piranha, who made his debut in Mario Kart: Double Dash; Wiggler, who debuted in Mario Kart 7; and Kamek, who appears in Mario Kart Tour (and was a character in Mario Kart 64 before being replaced by Donkey Kong in the retail version) are all set to join the roster of playable racers in this wave of DLC. Seven more courses will join the pack as well, but we have no indication of which tracks those will be just yet. You can see the announcement trailer below.\n\n\nWave 5 of the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass arrives this summer. The Booster Course Pass is included as a part of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription plan, or you can buy the DLC pack itself for $25.",

The game heavily emphasizes decision-making as your choices determine which of many playable allies you meet along the way join your party. \n\n\nThis enhanced remake includes a modernized version of the game’s real-time combat; players can now stun enemies with chain attacks. Another cool addition is that party members not in combat can still lend a hand by executing assist-style follow-up attacks.\nStar Ocean The Second Story R launches November 2 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.",

But Link was far from the only star of Nintendo's most popular game of 2023. During today's Nintendo Direct, the company announced the two other stars, Zelda and Ganondorf, are also set to receive Amiibo figures.\nWhile the Tears of the Kingdom Link Amiibo is somewhat disappointing in its functionality (mostly the same as its Breath of the Wild counterpart), it provides special fabric for Link's paraglider. It appears as though fans should expect similar functionality from the upcoming Zelda and Ganondorf Amiibo figures, as the press release promises \"valuable in-game items, as well as special fabric for the paraglider.\" \nThe Tears of the Kingdom Zelda and Ganondorf Amiibo figures arrive later this holiday season. For more on what each Amiibo in the Legend of Zelda series does within The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, check out our Amiibo guide here.

This transforms the world and gameplay in unexpected ways; pipes come to life, Mario can stretch his body to absurd lengths, and hordes of stampeding rhinos can appear, among other wacky effects. The biggest gasp came from a new power-up that transformed Mario into an elephant. Yes, you read that right. Mario's an elephant now, and it looks delightfully ridiculous. \nSuper Mario Bros. Wonder looks like a trip, and it launches on October 20.",

From a new underground area, to night expeditions, to a new demo out next week, here's everything you need to know about Pikmin 4.\n\n\nThe main draw in the newest game in the Pikmin series is Oatchi, a dog-like companion that assists you and your Pikmin as you try to survive the cute and hostile alien world. In addition to helping out with lifting and pushing items, you and your Pikmin can ride him across land and water. You'll also be able to upgrade his abilities over time, increasing the amount of damage he does, the number of Pikmin he can carry, or the total weight of objects he can push.\nYou'll need those upgraded abilities to explore Pikmin 4's new underground areas, which appear to be more heavily centered around contraption-based puzzles. With more treasures and new enemies, it's a lot less open than the aboveground portions, but should provide an interesting challenge.\nFinally, Pikmin 4 marks the first time in the series your explorer will be able to go on nighttime expeditions. Wild creatures are in a frenzy, making them much more dangerous, but you'll have the help of the new Glow Pikmin, a species only out at night. Instead of throwing them one by one, you can focus them into one glowing energy ball to release all at once, doing huge amounts of damage.\nIf you want to try it for yourself, a demo for Pikmin 4 will be available on the Nintendo eShop on June 28. The full game will be released one month from today, on July 21. For more on the game, check out the recent trailer that reveals you can customize your explorer, or download Pikmin 1 and 2 on your Switch right now.",

Today changed that, as the Nintendo Direct showed off in-game footage for the very first time. Check it out for yourself below.\n\n\nTitled “The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero,” this DLC comes in two waves. The Teal Mask is slated for this fall, while The Indigo Disk will come this winter. The first expansion will be available to play as soon as the player begins the treasure hunt, which happens a few hours into the game. Meanwhile, The Indigo Disk will require you to complete the entirety of the main story plus the previous expansion.\nThe first of the two expansions, The Teal Mask, will bring trainers to the land of Kitakami, an area completely distinct from the Paldea region they were born in. The adventure takes place during some kind of festival, and players will be tasked with unraveling mysteries tied to the local folklore. Part two, The Indigo Disk, takes place at Blueberry Academy, a school similar to Naranja and Uva Academy. As an exchange student, you’ll get to take classes, interact with students, and participate in the school’s battle-focused curriculum.\nWhile the trailers didn't provide any major new announcements, we got another look at Pokémon we already knew about, like Okidogi, Munkidori, and Fezandipiti in the Teal Mask and Terapagos in The Indigo Disk. There are also new looks at the DLC's exclusive characters Carmine and Kieran.\nNo specific dates were announced today, but The Teal Mask will still be released this Fall, while the Indigo Disk will be released sometime this winter.",

The implication of the teaser was that it was a game in early development, which is why it was a surprise when the game was revealed to be releasing July 20, 2023. That release date has now slipped, but only be a few weeks. It is now launching a month and a couple of days later, on August 22.\nYou can find the full delay statement, signed by developer Ascendant Studios and the game's director, Bret Robbins, below.\nAs you know, this is our first game as a self-funded independent studio. We set out five years ago to ambitiously make an original Magic FPS in a new fantasy world. Along the way, we worked through a pandemic, built a new team, developed on Unreal Engine 5.1 and pushed the boundaries of what we thought was possible. Now, the finish line is in sight.\nThe recent feedback to the game proves to us what we already felt: that Immortals of Aveum is something special. In order to realize our full vision, we are going to take a few extra weeks, making our new launch date Tuesday, August 22nd. This will give us time to further polish the game, finish optimizing all platforms, and deliver a strong launch. We owe it to ourselves and to you to get this right.\nFor more on Immortals of Aveum's delay, you can find an official blog post here.

What briefly began in the early 2010s at Techland, the developer behind the first Dead Island and similar open-world zombie game Dying Light, then moved to Yager Development, then Sumo Digital, and then finally, Deep Silver's Dambuster Studio, was for many years a giant question mark in the game industry.

Yesterday, Death Stranding's game director Hideo Kojima took to Twitter to clarify his involvement.\nJust to be clear, I am deeply involved in producing, supervising, plotting, look, design and content of the film adaptation of DS, just not in charge of directing.\nJune 18, 2023\nHere, Kojima confirms that he will not be directing the movie, but fans worried that Kojima Productions' involvement wouldn't involve input from the man at its helm can rest easy. In addition to his role as producer, Kojima will be \"deeply involved\" with many other elements of the film, including its plot and overall aesthetics. While the movie takes place in the existing Death Stranding world, it will \"introduce new elements and characters within the Death Stranding universe,\" according to Deadline. Whether that consists of a retelling of an existing plot or an entirely new one is unclear, but it will certainly have that distinct Kojima touch.\nIn addition to the film-focused branch of Kojima Productions, the film will be produced by Hammerstone Studios. Founded in 2018, the studio's best-known films include Barbarian (2022) and Bill and Ted Face the Music (2020). The studio's founder, Alex Lebovici, had the following to say to Deadline about the upcoming project:\nGiven the fact that the production teams have yet to announce any director, writer or actor that's attached to the project (I'm hoping it involves Nicolas Cage), it's still a few years out. If you're dying for more Kojima before then, you can re-watch the Death Stranding 2 reveal trailer or fantasize about the game Kojima wants to make in space.",

The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it?

Update!” hits on July 5 and adds two new game modes accessible after players have completed the main game. You’ll access these features by using a new arcade cabinet that appears in the hideout. \n\n\nThe first is BPM Rush, in which players fight waves of enemies as the beats per minute gradually rise with each level, eventually topping out at 200 BPM. The second new mode is Power Up! Tower Up!, a remixed version of Rhythm Tower that tasks players to take a completely underpowered Chai and gradually build him with randomized upgrades by climbing floors and tackling waves of foes. \nThis update also introduces new photo mode features such as stickers, filters, and poses, new clothing unlocks for Chai and Korsica, fresh 808 looks and accessories, and special attacks that incorporate CNMN and Smidge. \nHi-Fi Rush is available on Xbox Series X/S and PC.

Next week, PlayStation fans finally get their turn.\nDeveloper Cellar Door Games has announced that Rogue Legacy 2 will make the jump to PS5 and PS4 on June 20. Like the first game, you’ll take a randomly generated knight boasting a mix of strengths and sometimes hilariously crippling weaknesses through a sprawling castle to kill monsters, collect treasure, and uncover new areas. Between runs, you’ll spend hard-earned loot upgrading your town HQ, and unlocking new stores while improving the traits of your lineage of warriors to raise your odds of surviving subsequent runs. \n\n\nWe awarded Rogue Legacy 2 a 9 out of 10 in our review, with former editor John Carson writing, \"Despite my nitpicks, every new discovery unveiled, skills obtained, and boss defeated wipes away any grief and replaces it with deep satisfaction. There’s a lot to clean up with the core progression systems to make the ramp from beginning to end escalate more evenly, but I’ve enjoyed most of my hours struggling through countless generations of my goofy little bloodline. I am overjoyed the entertaining heritage of this series remains firmly intact.\"",

Like the game, the plot unfolds on a cursed island consumed by a devastating plague that has warped its residents into dangerous monsters. Only a flame-headed hero of legend can set things right, even though said savior isn’t entirely thrilled with the idea. \n\n\nDead Cells consists of 10 seven-minute-long episodes that will first air exclusively on the French anime streaming service ADN (which is co-producing the show) before becoming available worldwide. \nFor more on Dead Cells, check out our impressions of its last major crossover expansion, Return to Castlevania.

But all is not what it seems in the world of Varn...\nThe ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for the PC version of the first game of the Might and Magic series: Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Two modes are supported:\nThe original look and feel of the game (sound, which in the original consisted of merely the occasional beep, is not supported)\nA ScummVM-exclusive enhanced mode, which uses the interface of the later Xeen games, including niceties such as better character screens, automapping, and sound effects. It also integrates the impressive \"Might and Magic 1 Graphics Overhaul Mod\", which provides better in-game map and monster graphics. The xeen.cc file is required from Might and Magic: IV or Might and Magic: World of Xeen.\nBoth modes allow saving your game anywhere outside of combat via the ScummVM Global Main Menu (unlike the original game that only saved a single roster when checking into an inn). So make sure you save regularly, just in case you encounter problems.\nHelp us test both game modes by grabbing a daily build and adding mm.dat to the same folder as your game files. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way.\nNow, go forth, and discover the true secrets of the game that started the long running epic fantasy series!\n>",

          "description": "As I write this many of the development team and other members of the community are busy having fun at a meet-up in Brussels. Not me though, I’m stuck here doing a release. We’ve been busy refactoring quite a lot of the underlying code to make future changes easier, but along the way we’ve found and fixed a few more bugs and quality of life improvements that we figured were worth releasing sooner than whenever 14.0 comes along. Notably, OpenTTD will now automatically disable hardware acceleration if it detects that the last crash happened while initialising the graphics driver. While hardware acceleration works well for the vast majority of people, it causes crashes for people that then required command line arguments or manual config file editing to get it to work. This should be a better solution for those users. Additionally, there is a change to the default mouse mode on Linux to improve experience when dragging the map (and often to match expected behaviour in other games). As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. While you’re at it, have you seen the post about the upcoming addition of a automated opt-in survey to OpenTTD 14? If you have opinions, we’d like to hear them! Details here. Download Changelog Bug tracker",
