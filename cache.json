In case you missed it, the remake will run at 30fps in both docked and handheld mode. Now, you might wonder why this is supposedly such a big deal, but those who played the 2004 GameCube original will know that it ran at 60fps.\nIs it really that big of a deal, though? Sure, in principal, it would have been nice if Nintendo were able to achieve parity between the two versions, but given the significant leap in visual quality from the original to the remake, we can also understand why certain sacrifices had to be made (sentiments echoed by Bayonetta Origins' director, by the way).\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

In fact, we experienced the game exclusively on the PS5, so while we've got a good idea of how it runs on Sony’s hardware, we’re sadly not able to discuss how the Switch version fares.\nThat said, two hours is still a hefty amount of pre-release time to spend with Vengeance, so we can wholeheartedly confirm that if you’re a fan of the original, or if you’ve dipped your toes into some of Atlus’ other games, then you can be confident that you’re in for a wild ride (if only for the ever-amusing presence of the phallic-shaped demon, Mara).\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

You know the sort of thing, usually pairing some new-fangled/novelty control scheme with an activity you'd never tried in a game before; making cakes, driving a quad bike...eh...bobsleighing with the Jamaican Olympic team? The Endless Ocean series fits right into this mould and, as it turns out, revisiting its chillaxed dives — even with up to 30 other players in tow — wasn't a very good idea.\nNow, before we get into the negative stuff, let's start by pointing out that if you're looking for an incredibly low-energy, low-effort sort of gaming experience where all of the focus is on simply scanning marine life and then reading a tiny informational excerpt about each of them in order to expand your underwater knowledge, this is 100% the game for you. In fact, you'll likely never find another game more suited to your very specific needs. Please enjoy. For the rest of us, as much as learning about all the amazing creatures that live under the sea is a captivating pursuit, we're not sure we can justify the price tag given that there is precious little else to do here.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Not too shabby, considering that it's mostly the work of just one person, Grzegorz Styczeń of Slavic Magic, who has hopefully found time to sleep now and then between fielding bug reports and preparing the game's first patches.\nStyczeń understandably doesn't have much time for interviews right now - those troublesome archers aren't going to balance themselves - but yesterday I spoke to Tim Bender, CEO of Manor Lords publisher Hooded Horse, about how Styczeń is getting on. The answer, apparently, is: pretty good, because Styczeń has a healthy approach to early access development in keeping players close, without quite handing them the wheel.\r\n \nRead more",

Me too! Must have been the direct influence for Sea Of Thieves' new Season 12, which launched earlier this week with a bang - from two smoking barrels! Among the additions in this season of the ever popular salty sea-dog open-world adventure are double barrel pistols. They deal less damage per shot but have higher rate of fire, and you can charge them up to fire both barrels at once. \nOn the other end of the weapon scale are new throwing knives, capable of sneak attacks, light slashes, or, you know, throwing. You can nab any throwing knives you see lying around, too, which is fun. But honestly, the Bone Caller tool (the aforementioned jar of skeletons, which has a great Jason and The Argonauts vibe) and the Horn Of Fair Winds are are probably more useful. The winds from said horn can make your ship go faster, but can also put out fires or crowd control enemies, or for some reason make you swim faster? I don't think that makes sense, to be honest, but the horn has limited uses so as not to make you an unstoppable wind machine. \nRead more",

Fr. Justin, who was already kind of controversial anyway, offered the sacrament and claimed to be a real priest to Futurism, and gave the thumbs up to baptising a baby in Gatorade in an emergency.\nCatholic Answers (who have the domain Catholic.com; gotta imagine His Holiness wishes he'd moved quicker on that one) then defrocked Justin, making him  a lay theologian in a suit jacket, jeans and an open collar shirt that gives him a \"me and my wife saw you across the bar\" kind of vibe, when before he had the whole dog collar kit and caboodle.\nRead more",

I also distinctly remember making a not-completely serious but also somewhat true statement at the party about how that Tesco trip was the most fun I’d had in months, after which one of the metal men sneered at me. I felt self conscious at the time, but I’ve since grown comfortable enough with myself to realise that the metal man was a joyless fool, and going to big supermarkets is at least as fun as going to average metal gigs. There is nothing a drop D power chord can evoke in me that compares to the feeling of blurrily espying a chocolate trifle in the reduced to clear section.

          "description": "Harold Halibut has the vibes of a game that should be 4-6 hours long and is, inexplicably, 10-12. It's inexplicable not only because it's a slow game low on interaction - the game is really just a plot delivery mechanism; a TV show you can walk around where you advance the story by pressing A - but also because it's a game created using handmade miniatures. It's a sci-fi animated dolls house under the sea, self described as \"a cross between a game and a stop motion film\", and if my game required that amount of labour I'd edit that script down. Then again, there aren't that many locations, so maybe you'd really want to show them off.\nI love miniatures, and Harold Halibut is beautiful. It's also a lovely story about finding yourself and your place in the world, even if that place is unexpected, and having the courage to take that step. There are unexpected silly bits and strange bits and bits where people break into song, and bits where you read undelivered letters. But, at the same time, I totally understand why some people would find it boring.\nRead more",

          "description": "Lethal Company is a fun game but I know what you're thinking: it lacks feline energy. Whilst the simplistic game loop of collecting scrap on monster-infested moons and selling it to an equally monstrous company is enjoyable at first, it can get old pretty fast. As both Alice and James have attested with their experiences of this month's RPS Game Club pick, Lethal Company is a game that lacks a certain direction the more you play. I soon found myself settling into an existential crisis, reminiscent of my tumultuous stint in retail. A recurring thought back then was why bother stacking shelves, only to have someone buy the products and make me re-stack them again?\nIn the vain hopes of gaining a higher purpose in Lethal Company, I stumbled across the 'Needy Cats' mod. Essentially this mod adds a variety of cats to your game that will wander around the facilities and yelp for attention.\nPerhaps I'm just a glutton for heartbreak, but I decided that the game needed a galactic sanctuary full of adorable balls of floof. I hearkened back to my time playing Stray, the adorable cat adventure set in a post-apocalypse where humanity was all but wiped out. Could this be the prequel to Lethal Company? What if all Apocalypse games share the same universe, all orchestrated by The Company secretly pulling the strings of fate? Or maybe I just wanted to look at cute cats instead of terrifying mannequin monsters. Either way, the cats needed help. What follows is a diary log of my adventures which soon lead to increasing madness and ultimately, disaster.\nRead more",

          "description": "Great was the consternation of singleplayer horror likers at the popularity of Lethal Company, a landmark creepfest and satire of corporate piecework that is best enjoyed in groups of four. When will developer Zeekerss give us a proper singleplayer campaign mode, the loners of the gaming community wondered, peering from their boltholes and eyries. A Lethal Sole Trader, as it were - or failing that, how about some bot support? Well, this particular monkeypaw finger has curled. It curled about four years ago, actually, when Zeekerss released singleplayer-only horror compilation It Steals. \r\n\n\r\nI've been playing It Steals (available on Itch and Steam for £4 or $5) as part of our latest Lethal Company-dedicated Game Club, and let me tell you, it makes Lethal Company look positively, er, Nonlethal. There are many points of comparison between games, but while Lethal Company is geared more obviously for laughs, with its whoopie cushions and ReactionTube-friendly co-op mechanics, It Creeps just wants to scare you shitless. It's also brilliant.\r\n\n \nRead more",

This is true! It's also janky, and the RNG on the weird, warren-like buildings prompted me to ask \"Who designed this? What is this for? What kind of office is this??\" out loud, as I faced yet another dead end full of pipes. And yet! There's something about it that endears me to it far more than other similar games like Phasmophobia. Games like this all largely rely on you making your own fun with the tools they provide, but I think we should give the Lethal Company devs props for their tools, because they are weird and make no sense, and allow for some fantastic slapstick.\nRead more",

I don’t think survival games should emphasise wood-chopping in their announcement footage. It's like doing a Call of Duty montage of people getting shot three seconds from spawn. Still, if there's no katamari mechanic, the idea of raising a small army of mostly AI-controlled Roman soldiers behind enemy lines has a certain charm.

          "description": "To keep the ball rolling with this month's Game Club pick, we're asking what you, the readers, think of Lethal Company?\nBy now, I can confidently say that the RPS team are scrap collecting experts and can easily meet the quota set by the enigmatic Company. Much to James' chagrin, who prefers the chaos of being objectively 'bad' at the game. So confident was I in our abilities after our co-op sesh, that I dove into a solo game. Cue immediate death by a vengeful face-hugging bug. I'm expecting my first round of xenomorph child maintenance fees any day now.\nWith our blog chat scheduled for Friday 26th April, 4 PM GMT, here are a few conversation prompts we've gathered ahead of time. Tell us your thoughts in the comments and shoot any questions our way too. We hope to see you there!\nRead more",

          "description": "Fallout 4's \"next generation\" update goes live today. Timed to capitalise on the Fallout TV show's mad popularity, it'll encumber the 2015-released open world wasteland RPG with widescreen and ultra-widescreen support, Creation Kit fixes, and a \"variety of quest updates\" across Steam, Microsoft Store and GOG. There will be new items for the Creation Club, including the Makeshift Weapon Pack, which lets you blast people with a piggy bank like Elon Musk, and a new quest, Echoes Of The Past, in which you try to \"stop The Enclave from spreading their dangerous ideology and gaining a foothold in the Commonwealth\".\nThey're also bringing the game to the Epic Games Store and upgrading it to Steam Deck Verified status. Such days of bounty we do live through, but beware - it's possible the update will break existing Fallout 4 mods, which will be a problem for the very large numbers of you who've been downloading mods after watching the show. Indeed, the possibility of today's update messing with mods has already seen the creators of the promising Fallout: London delay release to assess the damage. If you're similarly concerned, you might want to disable auto-updates right now.\n Read more",

          "description": "Most of my time in Lethal Company is full of tomfoolery, panicking, and ultimately letting the quota down. As I run back and forth from the ship, only able to carry four things at a time in my puny arms, I frequently see the various monster inhabitants of the game excelling at pretty much everything. The Forest Keeper has brawny strength and can travel across the map in a blink of an eye, the Eyeless Dogs can sniff out an intruder in next to no time and The Butler has dedicated his life to maintaining a mansion even after the owners have long since gone.\nThis had me thinking - surely the various monster inhabitants of Lethal Company would make for a much better worker than myself?\nSure, most of them are ravenous killing machines - but that fits with the core values of The Company. After all, most of your time spent in the game will be collecting scrap on distant moons to meet an arbitrary quota set by The Company. You'll then feed your pilfered belongings to the insatiable maw of a tentacled horror (otherwise known as the boss). You may be able to sympathise depending on your occupation.\nSo, if the monsters in Lethal Company were given the chance to work for said company, which of them would make it as an employee of the month and which would crash and burn harder than me getting thrown from the airlock five times in a row?\nJoin me as I peruse the CV's of my favourite monsters in Lethal Company (as far as I know only half of them have opposable thumbs) and advocate for which of them should be my replacement as The Company's new hire. After all, once this month's Games Club is finished I'm not sure they'll even let me back on the ship.\nRead more",

The shrimp-looking Mantis may be recognisable to veterans (it once appeared in pre-Steam builds). And the Viperling is a venomous variant of the existing Spineling (a thorny seaworm with hull-piercing porcupine-like spikes). But don't worry, the medical systems have also seen a \"mini-rework\", which means drugs like morphine are \"less of a 'solution for everything'\". Wait. What?\r\n\n\r\nSubmariners in the game can still use morphine, opium and fentanyl to ease the pain of a monster attack, broken bones, wrecked organs, or be-bulleted body. However, the developers feel these drugs have been over-used. So they've rebalanced the opiates as part of their Blood in the Water update. Now the drugs have \"a much higher risk of causing addiction and overdoses, and morphine heals much more slowly, making it less viable for combat-heavy situations.\" Well. Guess I'll just die. \r\n \nRead more",

Usually, this process unveils new maps, modes, or weapons, and that was the case with Season 3 Reloaded. \n\n\nAs discovered by realityuk_, a new Pistol linked to 2024's Call of Duty release is set to be added to the game, with the name \"Sally\" written on it, and six tally marks. This has immediately set tongues wagging, with plenty of fans claiming the tally marks are confirmation that Black Ops 6 will be released later this year. \n\n\n\n\nFor those hyped by this prospect, I'm here to pour some cold water on the flames of your excitement. Look at that gun again, and tell me if you think it looks familiar. It should do, because it's the same pistol featured on the cover of 2010's Call of Duty: Black Ops, complete with the same tally marks and Sally scratching. \n\n\nIn my opinion, the inclusion of this pistol is to hype up the new Treyarch-developed game, but this pistol doesn't tell us anything about a possible name. \n\n\nIt's the exact same pistol. Image via Activision\n\n\n As for what the next CoD could be called, the prevailing theory right now is Black Ops Gulf War, although that hasn't been confirmed just yet. We'll likely learn more during the Call of Duty Direct that's set to take place on Sunday, June 9. \n\nThe post Black Ops 6 confirmed!?

The location is in the back area of a walled-in yard of a beige-colored building.

Doing so will update both the Mark the location of the body and Locate the body objectives for the Leave No Man Behind task, so it is time to head to an LZ and extract to base camp.\n\n\nOnce you're back at the base camp, open the Vendors tab and go to Gunny.

          "description": "Every time you turn in a task in Gray Zone Warfare, you receive numerous rewards. Typically you're rewarded with some items, cash, experience, and reputation with the Vendor who gave you the task. However, some users have noticed they aren't receiving the physical task rewards such as items and cash. Here's how to fix the missing task rewards in Gray Zone Warfare and get the items and cash you are missing for completing tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to get your rewards for completing tasks\n\n\nIn order to fix your missing task rewards in Gray Zone Warfare and get the items and cash you are missing, you need to collect the rewards from the messenger. Every time you complete a task that includes a physical item as a reward, be it some sort of loot, gear, or cash, you should get a notification in the bottom right that you received a message from that Vendor.\n\n\nThe message you receive is actually how you collect your missing rewards. Hit Tab to open up the UI when you are base camp, then look for the message icon in the top right, as indicated by the red arrow in the above screenshot. This opens up your messenger app, and now you want to click on the window of whichever Vendor you completed the task for. Then, in the message log on the right, you should see a yellow button where you can collect the items and cash that have been sent to you from the vendor.\n\n\nNon-physical rewards such as experience and reputation are automatically given to you when you complete the task and do not need to be collected. So every time you complete the task, this is all you have to do to get your rewards:\n\n\n\nComplete the task by clicking the complete button on the proper Vendor tab.\n\n\nOpen the messenger app by clicking the message icon in the top right of the UI.\n\n\nClick on the Vendor who gave you the task.\n\n\nClick on the collect button to receive the task rewards.\n\n\nThe post How to fix missing task rewards in Gray Zone Warfare appeared first on Destructoid.",

Here is everything you need to know about the BAL-27 and its best class setup for multiplayer. \n\n\nIt won't take long for players to notice that the BAL-27 is not your traditional AR. The weapon has a unique damage profile because the first four shots have a slower fire rate than the rest of the magazine. As a result, the weapon easily mows down enemies, but there is a slight delay in reaching that maximum damage value. \n\n\nWithout any statistics to use, it's hard to pinpoint how exactly the BAL-27 will stack up against other options during Season 3 Reloaded. But after getting some hands-on experience with the AR in a few multiplayer matches, the BAL-27 has potential and could very well be one of the best weapons to use. We set out to create a perfectly balanced loadout that excels in every category. \n\n\n Best BAL-27 loadout in MW3 multiplayer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuzzle: Purifier Muzzle Break\n\n\nBarrel: Crown-H3 Barrel \n\n\nUnderbarrel: DR-6 Handstop \n\n\nStock: Clarent Light Stock\n\n\nRear Grip: Channel-M Grip\n\n\n\nWhile using an AR, Tac-Stance, and hip-fire are irrelevant because those attributes are more important when using an SMG in close-range gunfights. So, for this BAl-27 loadout, we sacrificed both to improve statistics more suited for a medium-and-long-range dedicated weapon. Lets start with the Purifier Muzzle Break improves horizontal recoil and firing aim stability at the cost of bullet velocity and range. So to counteract that loss, the Crown-H3 Barrel improves Bullet Velocity and Range. \n\n\nNext, the DR-6 Handstop and Channel-M Grip both forego hip-fire and Tac-Stance spread to greatly improve ADS and aim walking speed, recoil, and gunk kick. Finally, the Clarent Light Stock addresses ADS Walking, crouching, and general movement speeds. This set of attachments strikes the perfect chord between mobility and recoil control.\n\nThe post Best BAL-27 loadout and class setup in Modern Warfare 3 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "In Disney Dreamlight Valley, you'll encounter three trials with mini puzzles as you explore Eternity Isle's ancient ruins. During the \"A Bit of Help From Your Friends\" quest, EVE's trial requires you to power an ancient console, while Rapunzel tests your musical ability by arranging notes on a stone wall. \n\n\nDisney Dreamlight Valley music note arrangement puzzle solution\n\n\nYou'll first find the solution to Rapunzel's music note arrangement puzzle on the floor in the East Chamber. After clearing out boulders and crystals, you'll uncover a small pressure plate and a note, revealing the placement of each musical note. Once you find this hint, interact with the three pillars in the room's center to move each note up along the wall, aligning them with the lines you find in the note.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nInteracting with a pillar once raises a music note by half a line. If you wish to use the note hint to figure out the puzzle on your own, now's your chance. You can find the note again by heading into your Eternity Isles memories menu and selecting the note under the Dreamlight Valley section. Otherwise, you'll find the exact music note arrangement below.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe leftmost note lays the lowest and needs only a couple of pillar activations, while the others require multiple. Once you use the pillars to place the notes on each line, stand on the plate you uncovered earlier to activate the puzzle's power and hear a brief singing session from Rapunzel. Doing this lets you progress through the \"A Bit of Help From Your Friends\" quest, leading to you activating one last pressure plate and unlocking the Ancient ruin's trap door. \n\nThe post How to find the right arrangement of music notes in Disney Dreamlight Valley appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Activision has already introduced several big-name crossovers during Modern Warfare 3's life cycle, but leaks point to a massive event coming in Season 4. \n\n\nSeason 3 Reloaded just started, but players are already looking forward to what's next. CoD leaker WarfareForum discovered files mentioning Fallout, Gundam, and The Crow crossovers in a data mine. This shouldn't come as too much of a surprise as Amazon Prime's Fallout show sparked a resurgence in popularity for the storied franchise. Several Fallout titles hit new concurrent player peaks, and the show was quickly renewed for a second season after shattering expectations. \n\n\nImage via Amazon Prime\n\n\nActivision has already established a trend of springboarding off the success of television shows. During Season 3, Activision added Rick Grimes and Michonne from The Walking Dead, coinciding with the launch of a new spinoff show. Before that, during Season 1, the devs reintroduced operator skins for Homelander, Starlight, and Black Noir from Amazon Prime's The Boys a few months before the upcoming new season this summer. \n\n\nUsing these previous crossovers as evidence, the Fallout show has plenty of potential candidates for operator skins. The three protagonists, Lucy, Cooper Howard, and Maximus, would all fit perfectly into the Modern Warfare 3 universe. An operator bundle usually costs around $20, including weapon blueprints, finishing moves, and other cosmetic items. Based on the Season 3 battle pass, we expect Season 4 to start on Wednesday, May 29. \n\nThe post Fallout crossover rumored for MW3 and Warzone Season 4 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Game-breaking glitches have marred Season 3 Reloaded's launch day in Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone. One of the issues makes it impossible to reload weapons, but thankfully there is a simple temporary workaround. \n\n\nThe Activision support team launched an investigation into an issue causing auto-tac sprinting to prevent reloading a weapon. Raven Software presented players with a temporary fix while attempting to permanently address the matter. Let's jump right into what's required. \n\n\nHow to fix the auto tac-sprint reload glitch in MW3 and Warzone\n\n\nImage via Activision \n\n\nHere is a step-by-step guide on how to fix the auto-tac sprint reload glitch. \n\n\n\nLaunch MW3\n\n\nGo into the Settings tab, which is located in the top-hand corner of your screen\n\n\nSelect Controller \n\n\nScroll over to Gameplay \n\n\nUnder Automatic Sprint, select Off from the drop-down menu \n\n\n\nWith this setting selected, sprinting is activated manually with the sprint button. Getting used to playing without sprinting automatically will take some getting used to, but it's much better than not being able to reload at all. Raven Software did not provide a time-line for when this issue will be addressed. \n\n\nSeason 3 Reloaded also caused Dev Error 5433 to rear its ugly head and created issues for PlayStation users trying to login. If this is still a problem for you, make sure to check out our guide on how the devs recommend fixing the error code, while a permanent solution gets worked on. \n\nThe post How to fix the auto tac-sprint reload glitch in MW3 and Warzone appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Square Enix, the company behind last year's Final Fantasy XVI and this year's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, has seemingly canceled some in-development games, taking on some big losses as a result. As for why, the company is aiming to be more selective about its projects moving forward. \nThis news comes from a release related to Square Enix's holdings, which explains the company is incurring losses of 22.1 billion Yen, or roughly $140 million, on its financial books for the fiscal year that ended in March. \n\n\n\"At the meeting convened on March 27, 2024, the Board of Directors of Square Enix Holdings voted, in light of the myriad changes underway in the environment surrounding its group, to revise the group's approach to the development of high-definition (HD) games with the intention of being more selective and focused in the allocation of development resources,\" the release reads. \"As a result of a close examination, the company expects to recognize approximately 22.1 billion Yen in content abandonment losses on its books for the fiscal year ended March 2024.\" \nWhile potentially canceled games might sound doom and gloom, it sounds more like Square Enix is sharpening its developmental focus to ensure that the games it releases are hits or, at the very least, financially successful for the company. Nonetheless, it sounds like roughly $140 million of games in development have been canceled and it's unlikely we'll ever find out what they were. \nThis release comes after a big splash from Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, which Square Enix released in February. Elsehwere in 2024, Square Enix is releasing Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail, the new expansion for the MMO that will kick off a new saga for the long-running game, in July. \nWhat's your take on this news?

          "description": "Housemarque is celebrating the three-year anniversary of its hit shooter roguelike Returnal by teaming up with Dark Horse Comics for a graphic novel, artbook, and a new animated adaptation you can watch right now. This news follows yesterday's tease from both Housemarque and later Dark Horse Comics about Returnal, sending fans into an understandable frenzy about what the teams had in store for players. \n\"Another year, another cycle,\" a post on X (formerly Twitter) from Housemarque reads. \"The Third time around, extra loot is exposed with Dark Horse flair.\" \nHere's what that flair brings to the Returnal universe: \nReturnal: Fallen Asteria Graphic Novel\nReturnal Artbook\nFallen Asteria Animated Adaptation\nNow, even with PlayStation dipping its toes into cross-media production with Amazon's God of War series and Netflix's Horizon adaptation, this Returnal adaptation isn't the same. Instead, it's an \"animated version of the first issue of the upcoming graphic novel, Returnal: Fallen Asteria.\" Check it out for yourself below: \n\n\nHosuemarque says the 88-page graphic novel will arrive in paperback on bookstore shelves starting October 22, 2024, and it will hit comic book shops the next day. \nIt's unclear if the animated adaptation above is the animated adaptation today's announcement is referring to or, if it's just the first part of it, since it only adapts the first issue of the graphic novel. \nHere's a look at the Returnal: Fallen Asteria issues coming this October: \nThere's no word on when the Returnal artbook will arrive, but presumably it's this year. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Returnal review, and then check out this story about the PC specs required to play Returnal on a desktop or laptop. After that, read about Returnal's Ascension update, which added co-op gameplay and a new challenge tower to the game. \nReturnal hit PlayStation 5 on April 30, 2021. It launched on PC on February 15, 2023. \nAre you excited about today's Returnal news? Let us know in the comments below!",

Plus, a new update for Starfield is coming later this week that will make changes to ship-building mechanics and more. \nHoward revealed this and more about Starfield in a new interview with Kinda Funny, which is where the Bethesda executive producer also discussed Amazon's Fallout TV show and the Fallout series in general, as reported by XboxEra. As for what to expect of Shattered Space, Howard didn't say much. However, we already know it will bring new story content, locations, gear, and more to Starfield. \n\n\nAs noted by XboxEra, Shattered Space will be free for all Starfield Deluxe Edition owners. \nAs for the update coming to Starfield later this week, Howard says it will focus on the ship-building. This lines up with what the Starfield team shared last year in its 2024 plans for the game. Here's what it said at the time: \"For those who love ship building, we'll also be expanding on ship customization with ship decorations, new ship building options, and more.\"\nOther updates scheduled for 2024 include new ways to travel, city maps, mod support, accessibility and additional difficulty options, and more. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Starfield review, and then read about how Starfield is surprisingly great as a remote-play game. After that, check out this story about how Starfield is more like a sci-fi theme park than an open world adventure. \n[Source: Kinda Funny via XboxEra]\nWhat do you hope to see in the Shattered Space expansion?

The company states the event will return in the future, but it plans to showcase upcoming games in a different manner over the coming months. \nFirst announced in a blog post, Blizzard plans to share details on upcoming games like World of Warcraft: The War Within and Diablo IV’s Vessel of Hatred expansion at other trade shows, such as Gamescom. The company also plans to launch “multiple, global, in-person events” for Warcraft’s 30th anniversary, which are described as being “distinct” from BlizzCon. \n“Our hope is that these experiences – alongside several live-streamed industry events where we’ll keep you up to date with what’s happening in our game universes – will capture the essence of what makes the Blizzard community so special,” Blizzard states in the blog post.\nA Blizzard representative tells Windows Central that Blizzard made the call to cancel BlizzCon and not Microsoft, which completed its acquisition of the company last year. In a statement to the outlet, the representative says, “This is a Blizzard decision. We have explored different event formats in the past, and this isn't the first time we're skipping BlizzCon or trying something new. While we have great things to share in 2024, the timing just doesn’t line up for one single event at the end of the year.”\nBlizzCon began in 2005 as an annual convention celebrating all things Blizzard. Last year's show saw the reveal of World of Warcraft’s next expansion, The War Within, as well as two other expansions coming after it. It's good that event is only taking a year off as opposed to being canned for good, and we're curious to see how the alternative events shape up over the coming months.",

          "description": "Dragon's Dogma 2 launched a little over a month ago and has already managed to sell 2.5 million copies, but Capcom is still releasing updates to patch minor issues with the game. While a large volume of complaints have been about the lack of a performance mode, this update (like the last update) does not address that issue. However, it does aim to clean up a number of irritating errors involving the behavior of pawns, the player's AI companions.\nAn update for Dragon's Dogma 2 is now live on all platforms!\nhttps://t.co/waEdG0ntSv\nApril 25, 2024\nFor starters, this update makes it easier to detect dragonsplague, an affliction that, if untreated, can lead to devastating consequences for your pawns and your world. It's also contagious, so it's a good idea to nip it in the bud as soon as you first encounter it. When afflicted, pawns' eyes will glow red – after this update, they'll glow more noticeably. The update also causes the disease to infect pawns less frequently.\nPawns should also be a lot less annoying now, thanks to a whole slate of minor refinements to their behavior. They'll jump off cliffs less often (which is hilarious but a wild inconvenience), say some lines less often, say other lines at more appropriate times and become less likely to offer to be hired while passing by on the street. They're one of the highlights of the game, so anything done to make their constant presence more consistent is always welcome.\nThere are also smaller adjustments, like adding the ability to zoom in on a character's face in shops, preventing monster attacks in town from leading to the player's arrest, and other miscellaneous bug fixes. You can read the full list of updates, as well as all past updates, here.",

          "description": "Taming a wolf in Minecraft is one of the game's simplest joys, and no matter how many times I start a new world, I always hoard bones in case I encounter one. But once you've adopted a canine companion, you probably hide them away in a house for safe-keeping, shielding them from the horrors of the game's hostile mobs. Today, Minecraft is adding a way to make them a little stronger – wolf armor.\n\n\nLike leather armor, wolf armor can be colored using dyes in-game, so if you've got multiple adopted animals, it'll still be easy to tell them apart. This variation is separate from the collar colors as well, creating plenty of possibilities. Even better, the game is also adding wolf fur variants for the first time, bringing eight new patterns for a total of nine. Each variant (Pale, Woods, Ashen, Black, chestnut, Rusty, Spotted, Striped, and Snowy) spawns in a specific biome. You can take a look at all the new breeds in the gallery below.\n\nOf course, players will need to be able to craft this wolf armor as well, which is where the new mob, the armadillo, comes in. These armored relatives of anteaters can be found in savannah or badland biomes, where they can be seen strolling around and curling into a defensive ball when certain enemies come near. Armadillos drop armadillo scutes, which are used to make the wolf armor, but the developers have reassured players that they can be brushed rather than defeated, so you won't have to go on an armadillo massacre to protect your pets. Armadillos can also be used to scare away spiders since they eat insects and arachnids in real life, and spider eyes can be used to breed them if you want to make your own armadillo farm.\nYou can read the rest of the notes for the 1.20.5 update right here.",

Epic says players who have these emotes hidden with this new setting will see a player using the emote standing still, with no emote sound. \nThis new setting can be found under \"Social Privacy\" in the Fortnite settings and it defaults to only show these confrontational emotes from friends in your party. Epic stresses that this setting does not change a player's ability to use any emotes. It is now live in-game. \nFor more about Fortnite, check out these Avatar: The Last Airbender skins now available in the game, and then read about how Fortnite's next Star Wars crossover will span Lego, Fortnite Festival, and Battle Royale.

          "description": "Publisher Atlus and developer Studio Zero have released a new trailer for the upcoming fantasy RPG, Metaphor: ReFantazio, and it features plenty of new gameplay. It also reveals Metaphor: ReFantazio will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 11. \nDubbed \"The King's Trial,\" this new trailer sets up a bit of the Metaphor: ReFantazio's world more, highlighting a tournament for the king's throne at the center of the narrative. It seems our protagonist and the friends and allies they encounter along the way are vying for a crown that others are also after. In order to claim it, players must complete trials across the lands, proving their worth. \nCheck it out for yourself in the Metaphor: ReFantazio gameplay trailer below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Metaphor: ReFantazio continues to look excellent, with its Persona inspirations on full display. That's not surprising, though, considering Studio Zero is composed of various leads from Atlus' popular Persona series, including the latest in the franchise, Persona 5. \nIf you've played Persona 5 Royal, or even the recently released Persona 3 Reload, then you know we're likely in for a treat when it comes to a few things: combat, narrative, and art. And if this new look at the game's menu are any indication, the Persona team has been cooking something special for Metaphor: ReFantazio. \nThe trailer also reveals Metaphor: ReFantazio will get a special Collector's Edition for $149.99. The game's standard release will cost $69.99.\nHere's what the Collector's Edition looks like: \nMetaphor: ReFantazio hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 11, 2024. \nFor more about the game, watch the Metaphor: ReFantazio reveal trailer. Read Game Informer's Persona 5 Royal review, and then read Game Informer's Persona 5 Tactica review after that. \nAre you picking up Metaphor: ReFantazio on day one?

The latest of these artists is Billie Eilish, who announced her collaboration with the game on social media earlier today.\nFortnite Festival Main Stage: 4.23.24 pic.twitter.com/dxaQBsqD4A\nApril 22, 2024\nEilish is not just getting a skin added to the game (like Eminem, for example), she's the next headliner for Fortnite Festival's main stage event, which will start tomorrow, April 23. This includes a set of artist-specific rotating songs players can compete for high scores in, as well as unlockable skins, songs, instruments, and other cosmetics, though unlocking all of these requires the purchase of the pricey 1,800 V-Buck Festival Pass. Previous headliners were The Weeknd and Lady Gaga.\nEilish recently made headlines for winning a Grammy, Golden Globe, and Oscar for \"What Was I Made For\" from the Barbie movie, which is a task she's now accomplished twice. Even more recently, she announced her upcoming album Hit Me Hard And Soft, which is likely her main marketing incentive for appearing in the game.

The showcase will also spotlight co-op roguelike 33 Immortals and Don't Nod's upcoming adventure title, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage.\nFor more context, last year's version of this event included over 20 games, including Sea of Stars, Karateka, and Vampire Survivors again, somehow.

          "description": "Total Eclipse, a real-time, curse-breaking, 3D adventure (with a dash of Indiana Jones flair), is ready for public testing!\nOriginally unleashed by Incentive Software Ltd. in 1988, Total Eclipse added yet another groundbreaking title to their repertoire of revolutionary games.\nStep into the shoes of a heroic archeologist on October 26, 1930, as a total solar eclipse akin to the one happening today over North America looms over Cairo. Knowing of the Ardognus prophecy, created by the powerful high priest Hahmid III, you must find and destroy the hidden shrine devoted to Ra before the eclipse occurs.\nEmbark on this exciting journey packed with a trusty gun for blasting through doors or dispatching undead mummies; a compass to guide you through a treacherous pyramid; a wristwatch to track the precious time left; and a water bottle to fight dehydration (you’re only human after all). \nCan you solve this ancient mystery within 120 minutes and avert catastrophe, or will Rah's wrath obliterate the moon?\nOur modern reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Total Eclipse support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC. More releases are coming at a later date. Additionally, there are three playable demos if you want to test the game. Please contact us if you have some other release or demo.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.\n>",
