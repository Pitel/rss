Sporting a gorgeous new art style and some additions and tweaks to the core gameplay, this reimagining of the ‘other’ NES ninja platformer offers up a fun and brutal return to basics.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Any suggestions? It almost seems there may be something tonally mismatched about the idea — unless you're going for comedy — and, honestly, when playing Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club, it's sometimes tough to know whether it's horror or humour we're supposed to be enjoying. It's hard to know whether to laugh or cry.\nThis brand new entry in the Famicom Detective Club adventure series has managed to arrive to quite a bit more fanfare and interest than would usually be reserved for an entry in a visual novel franchise that, whilst perfectly fine, has never really set the gaming world alight. Old has-beens (like this writer) sampled Tantei Club Part II via fan translation and enjoyed it for what it was, but whilst the 2021 remakes are nice to have, it's hard to say they are absolute must-plays, even whilst recognising their importance in terms of influencing the likes of Ace Attorney.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The opening radio chat between starting squad member Sid and a pal has that telltale charming tinge of overeager cockney. It also contains the words “bloody” and “arse” in quick succession, though thankfully not next to each other. The only piles are the logs Sid’s crouched behind as he prepares to sneak up to a cable car guarded by Nazis. That is the only haemorrhoids allusion I will ever make on this website. Until the next time I have to write about Andrew Wilson.\n“Oil just use my trusty knoife” mutters Sid as I take down my first guard. Straight away, the animation and noise indicators evoke the same Shadow Tactics or Desperados III goodness you’re probably expecting. Fine with me - that’s exactly what I’m here for. Mimimi’s closing was a real gutpunch, and while I don’t expect anyone to match their exceptional work any time soon, it’s at least reassuring to see Warsaw studio Artificer picking up the torch.\nRead more",

It seems there was more to that story than concern about the progress of Marathon. According to a new Bloomberg report citing anonymous sources, Barrett was in fact fired this spring after he was accused by several female Bungie staff of inappropriate behaviour.\n  \nRead more",

As several of you identified, this seemed like an odd comparison when Spice Maureen 2 specifically plans to charge for comparable cosmetics, although I imagine Willits was referencing the “packs” that his space game’s baubles come in. “Our fans never thought we ripped them off in World War Z,” he said, comparing Space Marine 2’s optional spendables to that game.\nWhether you see the cosmetic's pricing as egregious or not, yesterday’s roadmap does look to make good on Saber’s promise to keep wearables and playables separate.

          "description": "Almost a decade after his acrimonious departure from Konami, the shadow of Hideo Kojima still looms over Metal Gear Solid. He's there, barely camouflaged, in the undergrowth of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - a remake of the fifth Metal Gear game, originally released in 2004, which tells the tale of a lone US special operator hunting superweapons and old mentors in the jungles of the southern Soviet Union. \r\n\n\r\nI say \"remake\" but this feels more like a re-release, in spirit. True, it now runs on Unreal Engine, with the option of a manual, third-person perspective and cover-shooter controls in addition to the old top-down viewpoints. Yes, it boasts new flourishes, such as wounds now leaving scars, and clothes picking up stray leaves. Yes, there's a new interface with floating in-world menus, which makes shuffling between the layers a bit less awkward. It's the product of much labour, with development split between Konami and external support partner Virtuos. But where Konami's other big restoration project, Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake, is a creative dialogue with the original game, Delta seems consumed by faithfulness to Kojima's original design.\r\n\n \nRead more",

(It came out in 1997, and as such, I think the statute of limitations on spoilers has passed, but if you still intend to play, stop reading now.) The mission completes the long arc of foreshadowing begun by the intro's mention that capital-class spacecraft have been outlawed, following a ruinous war. It turns out that one particular evil corpo has been sneakily building one of these megaships - not only that, but you get to fly inside it, cannons ablazing. It was while doing so that teenage me realised the true exceptionality of the Video Game Artform. You can't fly inside capital ships in, like, symbolist poems or baroque symphonies, can you? You can't fly in poems or symphonies at all, unless you do so metaphorically - \"metaphor\" being a kind of poor man's graphics card.\nThe technology of flight simming has advanced mightily since G-Police's day. For instance: in Everspace 2's just-announced Titans DLC, you get to fly inside not just regular old spaceships, but massive space kaiju with procedurally generated digestive systems.

You can, quite literally, go on tours curated by historians around each of the game's respective maps. Instead of diving off a Sphinx and plunging your hidden blade into someone's spinal column, you can look up at the Sphinx and read a paragraph on its significance. Maybe view an actual, real life bit of ancient Egypt from an actual real life museum collection in-game. Perhaps embody an Anglo-Saxon lad in Valhalla, instead, and like, cook up some nettle soup having just got a fresh \"Friar Tuck\" at the local hair choppers (no guarantees on this last bit).\nThis is all to say that Black Myth: Wukong deserves such a mode, too. There were so many times throughout my review time where I stopped and stared and wondered as to something's meaning. Not only in the architecture, but in the characters, too. So here I am with a proposition: how about instead of thwacking things with my staff, I can use it as a walking stick and point it at things I want to learn about.\nRead more",

Still, it does sound like he’s managing to have some fun there, mainly by hitting up Saber Interactive COO and former id Software co-owner Tim Willits for some top tips on how to avenge Edwin’s thieving ways.\nTips about kill-stealing aside, James found time to ask Willits about Space Marine 2's microtransactions, and whether there was any nervousness returning to a cult hit series… especially one a lot of people had almost given up on ever seeing again. “Even the “push forward” combat of the original was part of [id’s] inspiration when we created Doom 2016,” answered Willits. “So for me personally, it’s this huge circle. It’s always intimidating working on a franchise that people love.” But, with the right team, technology, and vision he says, “it just comes together.”\nRead more",

          "description": "Now, I never played quite as much as our Brendy did of the original Splitgate. But I had a fun time with its mixture of Halo-esque trigger pulling and portalling around! So I was intrigued to give the alpha version of Splitgate 2 a go and see if it had a little more substance to it than its initial reveal, which gave off a, \"it's Splitgate but with more money\" feel. \nWell, I think it's… a bit serious? It certainly has more polish and some extra additions, yet I didn't come away from it thrilled by its more competitive, class-based FPS leanings. I think it just needs a bit more time, perhaps, for a portal to open and some silly rocket launchers and baseball bats and zombies to come tumbling out of it.\nRead more",

A long-limbed man riding a bicycle in a threadbare suit chases children down an alley. A gangly, bowler-hatted pursuer scuttles down a long table like a spider. It's familiar enough territory, at least at first glance. But when Tarsier have a body of work subconsciously scarred by phantasms this vivid, recurring nightmares are just as potent.\nRead more",

It also features a traffic-summoning warlock named Steve wearing a hi-vis robe. It’s finding that one absolutely, perfectly ridiculous XCOM turn, every turn…and at the same time knowing it’s absolutely, perfectly fine if you don’t.

Developed well over two decades ago, the original Silent Hill 2 is the magnum opus of Polish horror stalwarts Bloober Team. Running on then-innovative \"Unreal Engine 5\" technology created by Jazz Jackrabbit publishers Epic MegaGames, it's a wonderful abyss of a game that remains perfectly playable today, given a certain amount of tolerance for the quirks of the era.\nIt begins with your character, James Sunderland, descending from the road towards the eponymous Midwestern nowhere-town. Like many games of the period, Silent Hill 2 uses a third-person, over-the-shoulder manual camera, which allows you to glance fearfully up at the monstrous pine trees that fringe the path - each rising from a bulging tide of fog that menaces with the suggestion of approaching figures. There is moisture everywhere, gushing from drain pipes and dribbling down concrete barriers. As you amble into the murk, deathly chords and groaning, unmechanical motifs reverberate from somewhere deep underground. \r\n \nRead more",

Silent Hill 2 is the more feted of the Hills - if I were a calculating franchise custodian tasked with 'bringing back' one of the acclaimed original trilogy, that's probably the instalment I and my spreadsheets would fix upon. I mean, it's the game with Pyramid Head in it - the nearest thing Silent Hill has to a mascot, and it's not like there's an issue of cutting out plot material: each game in the Silent Hill series is, on some level, a distinct story with a distinct protagonist.\nStill, the decision to 'skip' the first game in the series, whose world, narrative themes, music and art direction set the parameters for all the rest, made my brain itch a bit, and when I ran into Bloober's creative director Mateusz Lenart and lead producer Maciej Głomb at a Konami event, I had to ask about it. \r\n \nRead more",

Still, I'd quite like it to come good, if only so I can justify op-eds about Lewis Carroll, and I'm somewhat encouraged by what I've heard of the game's forthcoming Realms Rebuilt update. \n Read more",

What separates Black Myth from the crowd, though, is its slick presentation and a sense of generosity. You're to witness the most lavish, cinematic worlds and its creatures. And you're to enjoy battering everything with your staff as a highly athletic monkey with copious spells at his furry follicles and fingertips.

The strategy game’s 5.2 update is on the horizon, and tagging along with it are the first of the “extra bits” the team teased in June. I’m very excited about them. They sit somewhere between the usual patch fare of stat tweaks and errata, and the weightier faction facelifts that come alongside paid DLC. They’re also focused right where Immortal Empires needs them the most: depth, rather than width. In the dawi’s case, quite literally.\n \nRead more",

Po čtyřech dnech výslechů ho propustila z vazby, ale Durov bude pod policejním dohledem a nesmí opustit zemi. Ve středu to podle agentury AFP uvedla pařížská prokuratura. Paříž vyčítá Durovovi a jeho síti Telegram, že nedostatečně komunikují s úřady a neposkytují informace, o které žádají soudní orgány. Tím by se platforma a její šéf mohli dopustit spoluúčasti na zločinech, které uživatelé Telegramu plánují a koordinují pomocí této sociální sítě. Francouzské úřady v této souvislosti zmiňují pašování drog, šíření dětské pornografie či vydírání.",

          "description": "Grenaa Games has announced that Fabledom, a casual city-builder set in a magical fantasy world, will arrive on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch on September 12, 2024. While its full release has been available on PC since May 13, you can now enjoy this relaxing from the comforts of your couch, bed, or anywhere else you game from.\n\n\nFabledom is a city-builder game that, although it still has resource management and villager satisfaction as key features, focuses more on the casual side of the genre. You still have to watch your income and available resources, but these normally stressful features are dialed down slightly to help you focus on the more cozy side of things. Along the way, you'll watch your villagers grow the town by building various important structures, preparing for winter, and even occasionally finding romance.\n\n\n\n\nWhen Fabledom 1.0 initially launched on PC, it added numerous new buildings, rulers, and quests, which we expect will also be available on consoles from day one. There are even dragons, which I'm always happy to see regardless of the game or genre. These all make for extra opportunities to experience the relaxing and interesting side of magical fantasy worlds.\n\n\nSince then, it's also received its final patch, 1.06, which introduced numerous bug fixes, optimizations, and quality-of-life changes. Fabledom's console release will likely get some tweaks to address any issues that surface from the transition, but we likely won't see many new features in the near future.\n\n\nFabledom will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch on September 12, 2024, for $20.99 or your regional equivalent. It's available for pre-order now, allowing you to prepare for its launch early. Its full PC release is also available through Steam for the same price.\n\nThe post Adorable fairytale city-builder Fabledom launches on consoles next month appeared first on Destructoid.",

Now, a recent post from the developer shows that this is still the case, but the patch is taking so long, it's detracted from working on their next project.\n\n\n\n\nThe message on X shows that Barone is more than aware that 1.6 is taking a lot longer than they imagined, admitting it would be a \"huge relief\" if it was ready today.

          "description": "Switch owners may ask the question, \"Heaven or Hell?\" soon as a PAX West banner has reportedly leaked a Guilty Gear Strive port early. The event begins this weekend, but the banner was put up earlier than publisher Arc System Works likely wanted. \n\n\nImage via Arc System Works\n\n\nGuilty Gear Strive is likely heading to Switch\n\n\nIn an X post by SoySauceAsian_ that's since been taken down, an image of a Guilty Gear Strive banner advertising a Switch version was published to the internet. It has since been circulating around Reddit and other outlets. The banner says \"Nintendo Switch Version\" in bold letters, asking PAX West attendees to pre-order the game. \n\n\nYou would think the developer would let attendees check out the game. Arc System Works, however, doesn't have a booth at the event, according to the exhibitor list on PAX's website. Perhaps Nintendo could be hosting the game as Guilty Gear Strive is a popular title within the fighting game community. Come to think of it, it's strange that Guilty Gear Strive wasn't revealed during the latest Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase.\n\n\nAn official Guilty Gear X page has confirmed over 3 million copies have been sold since the game's launch in June 2021. With this success, the series is also getting an anime adaptation. It makes sense if Arc System Works wants to expand the game's reach to the Nintendo Switch audience. The developer has also previously launched Dragon Ball FighterZ and DNF Duel on the system. \n\n\nOur 8.5/10 review called Guilty Gear Strive \"a good, solid, very online-capable fighting game with plenty of big swords, charging dolphins, and doctors with questionable credentials to go around.\" That sounds like a recipe for a great anime fighter. \n\nThe post Guilty Gear Strive Switch port leaked at PAX West appeared first on Destructoid.",

When you start crafting armor beyond Legendary into Mythic, it’ll be useful. \n\n\nThe stat boosts in armor and other secondary effects that come from it will make the remainder of your game much easier too. The transition in difficulty from Chapter 4 and onward is steep, so you definitely want to even the playing field.\n\n\nHow to get Celestial Ribbon in Black Myth: Wukong\n\n\nTo get Celestial Ribbons in Black Myth: Wukong, you will start getting them after beating the main final boss of Chapter 4. After that, you’re mostly going to get this from major bosses and chests moving forward until the end of the game. This also includes buying some for Will at a Shrine.\n\n\nThe following bosses after Chapter 4 will drop Celestial Ribbons:\n\n\n\nKeeper of Flaming Mountains\n\n\nYaksha King\n\n\nBishui Golden-Eyed Beast\n\n\nSupreme Inspector\n\n\n\nIn Chapter 5, three chests contain this crafting material, so stay vigilant. In Chapter 6, you’ll earn one from buying it at a Shrine store.\n\n\nIn the end, you should end up with ten Celestial Ribbons if you did everything up until the initial credits. \n\n\nYou can earn two additional ones if you complete the secret ending. This will require you to complete all secret areas from every chapter including the treasure hunter quest.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHow to farm Celestial Ribbon in Black Myth: Wukong\n\n\nYou can’t really farm this material. There is only a finite amount of them you can collect on your first run. If you are looking to craft all armor sets for the trophies/achievements or you’re trying to turn everything mythic, you have to go into New Game Plus.\n\n\nThese will be more readily available to you, along with other armor sets of the Mythical rarity.

It turns out to be a gag, and if you could easily look up the name (like you maybe just did), then you’d miss it entirely.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe question comes up after Kamihara introduces you to the bartender, Mama Shoko. She apparently knows everything about the area, but she doesn’t trust police, and while you’re not a police officer, you’re close enough, and she doesn’t trust you either. You have to impress her before you open up. Guessing her name is how it’s done. To find her name, you have to read the Health and Safety placard directly behind her (next to the alcohol). Your character will then deduce that the name on it is Mama Shoko’s real moniker, and you can then start the dialogue by asking about Mama Shoko.\n\n\nOnce you’ve entered the name, she’ll then reveal a big secret to you. It’s not going to crack the case wide open, but it will confirm a few things. I won’t spoil it for you, but even if I did, you probably didn’t read this far.\n\nThe post Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club: What is Mama Shoko’s real name? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club is the third core title in the Famicom Detective Club series. What was formerly Japan-exclusive finally came to North America in 2021 as Famicom Detective Club: The Missing Heir and The Girl Who Stands Behind. How important is it to have played those games before starting Emio.\n\n\nNot all that important, as it turns out. Emio is its own mystery and features characters who are newly introduced to the series. There are some returning faces like Mr. Utsugi, Ayumi, and Detective Kamada, but their roles require no previous introduction.\n\n\nLikewise, there are references made to previous games, but knowing what they refer to, specifically, doesn’t really matter. The protagonist sometimes refers to his parents and troubled childhood, but it’s within context. He also mentions having a previous bout of amnesia, but that’s all you need to know. The references made are within the context of the current case, so intimate knowledge isn’t required.\n\n\nFamiliarity can enrich the experience, however. It’s also worth noting that the remakes of the first two Famicom Detective Club games are very recent and close to the standards of Emio. If you’re curious about the series, it might be more fun to start at the beginning (The Missing Heir if following release order, The Girl Who Stands Behind if you prefer chronologically). However, if the plots of those two games don’t interest you, while the idea of a bag-enshrouded serial killer is more enticing, then you won’t lose much if you skip ahead and start with Emio.\n\nThe post Should you finish the previous games before starting Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club appeared first on Destructoid.",

Here’s where to find the blueprints for Natlan’s weapons so you can craft as many as you need.\n\n\nNatlan Smithy location: Stadium of the Sacred Flame\n\n\nAll of Natlan’s craftable weapon blueprints can be purchased from Alom at Natlan’s Smithy. The Smithy is located in the southern section of the Stadium of the Sacred Flame. From the teleporter at the entrance to the Stadium, walk forward until you see a small set of stairs to the left. Go up the stairs and through the door. Head down the corridor, and you should be face to face with the Smithy.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nTalk to Alom and ask to buy some weapons. He has the forging blueprints for Natlan’s craftable weapons for sale. They don’t cost Mora, though. Instead, you’ll need to trade various Natlan regional materials as well as Condessence Crystals.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nOnce you have the blueprints, the weapons can be forged using Condessence Crystals, White Iron Chunks, and Borderland billets. If you don’t have Borderland billets, you can convert billets of another type at an Alchemy bench. Before you spend your precious billets, though, you might be able to get some of them for free.\n\n\nGet some Natlan weapons for free\n\n\nAt the time of writing, Genshin Impact has a web event with three of the craftable weapons as prizes. All three weapons have been unlocked as rewards, so all you need to do is click through the web event to receive them. This only takes a few minutes, and your rewards should be delivered instantly via in-game mail. The web event runs until September 24, so if you haven’t participated yet, do it now!\n\nThe post How to get Natlan craftable weapon blueprints in Genshin Impact appeared first on Destructoid.",
