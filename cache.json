The gaming world - and Switch - is full of cat games, either starring cats or centred around caring for them, or just focus on chilling in a virtual cat café. So many cats.\nSome of us prefer the qualities that dogs can offer, though, and a rather charming title on the way to Switch later this year will give a creative twist to a true story. Space Tail: Every Journey Leads Home picks up the story of Bea, a dog sent into space in the early years of the space race. In reality a number of animals were sent to their deaths to test technology ahead of manned missions, but this game aims to craft a fantastical adventure around Bea as a surviving canine.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Created, designed, composer, and written by Laura Shigihara — whose voice you can hear on the Deltarune soundtrack, To the Moon, and Minecraft, as well as being the composer for Plants vs. Zombies — Rakuen is an adventure game with no combat but a ton of feels.\nWith plaudits such as \"I haven’t felt so swept away by a world in so long\" from our friends at RPS, we can see that Rakuen succeeds in being a thought-provoking, heartwrenching, and heartwarming game that might just make us shed a tear or two. It's clear that working on To the Moon and Finding Paradise, two games that were also made using the RPG Maker XP engine, has influenced Shigihara's own emotional game.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "EarthBound 2? Earth3ound? MotherEarth?\nLast weekend we celebrated Mother's Day by having a real Mother of a blow-out. We began with our weekly Box Art Brawl poll pitting EarthBound against Mother 2. We then took a look back at memories old and new of both EarthBound and the legendary (and legendarily sobering) Mother 3.\nAnd then we followed up with the centrepiece of our celebrations — a real labour of love from one of NL's resident senior video producers, Mr Zion Grassl. His hour-long video — 'The MOTHER We Share: Our EarthBound Story' — featured a whole bunch of luminary EarthBound fans (including one Toby Fox, creator of Undertale) in an exploration of why the series means so much to many gamers. It's really something and definitely worth checking out if you haven't already.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

And this year's presentation has a few juicy morsels, one of which reveals that EA is working on a Remake for the end of 2023.\nWe already know EA is publishing the upcoming Dead Space remake, so this is likely to be something brand new. EA has a huge library of games that it has published or developed, of course, so it could be absolutely anything. Ignoring that 2012 reboot, though, perhaps a remake of SSX or its incredible sequel, SSX Tricky, could be on the cards?

If the game’s grimdark aesthetic didn’t warn you, here’s another from me directly: this game is brutal. Be mentally prepared to start over, over and over again. The “one more round” syndrome is strong with this mashup of tower defense and strategy.\r\n\n\r\nThe game’s premise is simple: survive. While the standard survival mode is challenging enough to warrant hours of gameplay, Age Of Darkness’s modifiers let you amp up the carnage for a nightmarish good time. See those little creatures all over your screen like bees in an unstable hive? Now picture building a settlement over them. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Even with King Kong and Godzilla arriving in the game today, I'm still playing Fortnite over it, which says it all, really.\nWhy did I stop playing Warzone? Other games came along, I suppose. Maybe I'd become a bit burned out, which would only be natural considering the amount of hours I spent ducking and trucking. But I think the way it's changed has played a big part in my departure. More specifically, there's been too much change. The game looks bonkers now.\nRead more",

Despite suffering a stroke just a couple of months beforehand, the 85-year-old YouTuber was on fine form during her PAX East panel, speaking to a packed out theatre of fans and viewers who have spent the better part of six years following her various playthroughs through Skyrim as a multitude of different characters. She talked briefly about her writing and character creation process for her Let's Play-style videos, before spending a whopping 45 minutes answering questions from the audience. These covered everything from her favourite things in Skyrim to her favourite, real-life candy, and also included a surprising number of horror game recommendations. In her own words, she loves stuff that's \"weird and creepy\", and has recently been looking for something new to play. \"I’d really like to play a dark, scary game,\" she said, and the audience were only too happy to oblige. \nIt was a truly wonderful way to spend a Saturday afternoon, and as soon as it was over, both Liam and I knew it was too good not to share. Here's a written transcript of the entire audience Q&A in full, plus a summary of her opening speech, for your reading pleasure. \nRead more",

These latest swings at Nvidia and their best graphics cards are ostensibly available from today, though third-party retail listings are currently hard to find, and AMD’s own store only lists the RX 6750 and RX 6950 XT... which are both sold out.\r\n\n \nRead more",

They're asking $810 for the graphics card after a $30 rebate, some $450 below the GPU's ludicrously high MSRP. That makes this model actually cheaper than almost all RTX 3080 10GB cards on the market, and a worthy deal for our hallowed deal archives. \nRead more",

No fully-formed, review-style thoughts on it yet, though after an unusually stressy installation I do have a question: does it need to be so god-damned big?\r\n\n\r\n“Yes, because heat” is probably the answer, as when you’ve got as many processor cores as the RTX 3090 Ti, running at such high clock speeds as the RTX 3090 Ti, and with as much memory as the RTX 3090 Ti, it’s a bad idea to try building an RTX 3090 Ti that’s the size of a postage stamp.

Magic is corrupting the land, giving rise to monstrous creatures and ravenous undead, and the source of all of this destruction, Mages, must be hunted and their hearts devoured if the Kingdom is to survive. Like Ska Studios’s previous outing, the game features difficult combat, extensive equipment options, and hulking bosses to slay. But while the scale has increased and the combat and visuals are as slick as ever, there are some growing pains that only just manage to hold the game back from its full potential.\nUpon booting the game up, it’s immediately clear that you’re in for a visual treat.The design and detail are just ever so lovely: from the way firelight gives a soft glow to its surroundings in the twilight, to how fog wafts lazily over cobble stairways in a musty dungeon, it’s all just so utterly gorgeous to look at. Ska Studios have always had a recognizable art style – imposing architecture and grungy moppets – but it’s plain to see here that they’ve upped their game in the best possible way. According to the devs, every asset was created from scratch, and that care shows in every frame.\nRead more",

          "description": "I spent much of my childhood hunkered around the family PC using an emulator to run Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Arcade Game. Years have passed since I last played, causing the vague memories to distort into a recollection that’s nothing like reality. In my head, that first arcade game captured the frenetic energy of the TMNT cartoons I’d watch on a Saturday morning. The reality was quite different, with the turtles awkwardly bumbling through Manhattan while occasionally smacking an enemy.\nThat realisation has never been more apparent than after playing the first two levels of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge, a successor to those early beat ‘em up TMNT arcade games being developed by Tribute Games and published by DotEmu. It captures the aesthetic of those childhood memories and makes them a reality, which is a testament to Tribute Games’ understanding of TMNT as a brand. But it also feels far too familiar, failing to substantially innovate on the original formula.\nRead more",

Games that are best enjoyed with a notepad often involve some mystery, or require drawing strange symbols or shapes that can't be quickly or easily replicated on your PC. They might involve hurried arithmetic, amateurish maps, doodled floorplans, scatter-brained lists. In these cases it transpires that the giant machine whirring three inches from your nose just won't cut it. Sometimes you gotta use a pencil.

The Naga Trinity's key feature is that it comes with three interchangeable side panels, each with a different amount of layout of buttons - so you can have a regular two-button side layout for FPS titles, a seven-button layout for more complex games (MOBAs?) and a 12-button calculator-style layout when things get properly exciting (MMOs). Or you can just figure out which one is your favourite, and keep it on forever more. \nThe Naga Trinity's UK RRP is £110, but it normally goes for about £70 or £80. Today, it's down to £55 - a nice discount!\nRead more",

          "description": "May is a relatively quiet month when it comes to new PC games. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, of course. The first half of 2022 has been unusually stuffed with great things to play, and I’m sure a lot of us will be thankful for the opportunity to spend some time with the few bits and pieces that were overshadowed by your Elden Rings and your Dying Light 2s earlier in the year.\r\n\n\r\nFor those looking for something new, however, May still has a lot of interesting stuff to offer those hungry for an indie game or two. Think of me this month as a waiter in a fancy restaurant, offering you a carefully curated selection of bite-sized delights as part of our tasting menu. What we have on offer is both nutritious and delicious, a journey through genres that is sure to excite the palette.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I started playing it, then moved and didn't have a PC for a long time, and it was only recently I finally got my PC back and finished the game last week. It took me around 12 hours of playing the game to travel around a strange cuboid planet using postage stamps to fix hairdryers for robots, but stretched over three months in real life. And reviewing a game this many weeks after release isn't normal procedure either, but I really like FixFox and I want people who might like it to stand a better chance of finding it. I also think a break of several weeks isn't the worst way to experience it, either.\nRead more",

I will hug and skulk between half and full height walls like nobody's business, creeping up the map inch by inch lest one of my precious party members accidentally sets off an entire warren of alien nasties by blundering too far ahead or, heaven forbid, one of them gets nicked by a stray bit of shrapnel. To say I'm overprotective is an understatement. \nThankfully, the Grey Knights in Warhammer 40K: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters are made of sterner stuff. I mean, just look at these brutes. They're enormous. Even the Gears Of War lads would be jealous of the kind of muscle these big robo boys are packing, I'm telling you now. They're by no means invincible, of course, but they can hold their own out of cover, and pick themselves back up again when your best laid plans inevitably start going down the drain. It may not be my most natural style of tactical manoeuvring, but man alive is it liberating.\nRead more",

That's a fantastic deal for a comfy mouse with 11 programmable buttons, adjustable weights and an 'infinite' scroll wheel. \nIf you prefer your mice with more batteries and fewer cables, the wireless G502 Lightspeed is also discounted heavily, from £129.99 to £57.99. I reckon that's strong value for a mouse that remains comfy, high-spec and fully-featured, while adding on Logitech's industry-leading wireless tech. The wireless mouse is also much less frequently discounted than its predecessor, which does tend to see a price drop in line with the major 'shopping holidays' of the year. \nRead more",

          "description": "Bethesda has delayed Starfield and Redfall to the first half of 2023. \nThis news comes by way of an update posted today by the official Bethesda Twitter account which explains that both teams behind Starfield and Redfall, which are Bethesda Game Studios and Arkane Austin respectively, need more time to ensure the games are the best they can be. \nAn update on Redfall and Starfield. pic.twitter.com/pqDtx26Uu6\nMay 12, 2022\nRedfall was announced just last year with a planned release for sometime in the summer of this year while Starfield, which was revealed nearly four years ago, was expected to release on November 11, 2022. Now, players will have to wait roughly a year to play both.\nBoth will launch onto Xbox Game Pass now that Bethesda is owned by Microsoft. It's unclear when we'll get our first deep-dive looks at both of these games but considering Bethesda said \"soon\" in its update today, there's a good chance they show up at the Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase happening on June 12. \nWhich game are you more excited to see?

This time, the iconic Chucks highlight a single Pokémon on each pair. There are Pikachu shoes, Eevee shoes, Charizard shoes, and Mewtwo shoes, and all four pairs look amazing. \n\nAs you can see in the images above, the shoes are designed to match the main color of each Pokémon they represent – the Pikachu shoes are bright yellow, the Eevee shoes a tan-ish brown, the Charizard pair are fire-type orange, and the Mewtwo chucks are a stylish and subdued pink-ish purple. Unfortunately, all signs point to this drop being exclusive to Japan. \nFirst off, they only seem to be available on Converse’s Japan website, with all four pairs expected to go live this week for roughly $75. There’s also the fact that the shoes feature the Japanese nomenclature of each Pokémon’s name, which is why the Charizard shoes say Lizardon. However, that might just be a styling decision so perhaps there’s a chance that these shoes make their way over to the West sometime in the future. For now, though, it seems you’ll need to navigate the Converse Japan site to secure a pair (or four pairs) of your own. \nIn the meantime, check out the most recent Pokémon x Converse team-up and then read about the reveal of Pokémon Violet and Pokémon Scarlet after that. \n[Source: Kotaku]\nWhich pair of Chucks are your favorite amongst this lineup?

Next month, we can run off to our favorite Lego supplier to grab an Optimus Prime Lego set. We don't know what it looks like yet, how many pieces are in the box, or how much it will cost, but it's OPTIMUS PRIME! None of that stuff matters. This will likely be a no-brainer purchase for Transformers fans. Here's Lego's official teaser announcement:\nBegin the epic build. #LEGO #Transformers #OptimusPrime pic.twitter.com/rjdQbdej43\nMay 11, 2022\nLego is kicking of Transformers' reign in Lego the right way: with the leader of the Autobots. If this product flies off of shelves (which it likely will), I'd love to see more Transformers get the brick treatment. Megatron would likely be the second set, and what comes next is anyone's guess. Grimlock, Bumblebee, Soundwave, and Starscream are a handful of characters that probably wouldn't be far off.\nI'm guessing the brilliant minds at Lego have figured out how to use all of the pieces in the box for two transformations: the robot form and the vehicle. Some Lego sets that already exist use the same pieces for three different builds (meaning we could get some triple changers!)\nWhat do you think of Transformers moving on from Kre-O brick building to Lego? Which characters or action sets would you like to see next?\nI'm an avid Lego collector and builder. The only thing that may scare me off of this set is if it is based on the Transformers films. I'm hoping Lego goes with a Generation 1 design, which debuted in the 1980s era cartoon.",

The flow of combat, the density of the open world, and the overall dark vibe align nicely with the Arkham series, which this Montreal studio had a hand in with Arkham Origins.

Rising up from quirky Scotland-based developers with a taste for pulp and crime fiction, Rockstar evolved radically, shifting into innovators and provocateurs, creating some of the industry's most influential and blockbuster titles. In the lead up to the eagerly anticipated Red Dead Redemption 2, we came together as a staff to rank every single game that Rockstar developed (this means we excluded published titles like L.A. Noire and Smuggler's Run). From the humble top-down beginnings of Grand Theft Auto to the blood-soaked streets of Manhunt and the beautiful jaw-dropping vistas of Red Dead Redemption, you’ll find every single title put in its proper place in terms of influence, importance of innovation, and just plain fun.\nWith all that in mind, let’s steal a ride and roar down this road to hell.

          "description": "Pro wrestling is a combat sport. Scripted, yes, but the crux is two superstars stepping into a ring and (mostly) pretending to beat the snot out of each other. That’s why it’s been understandably boxed into the fighting/simulation genre. Outside of a few collectible card games and general manager sims, the genre has rarely strayed beyond its competitive roots, and I think that’s a shame. Wrestling can offer so much more to video games. \nThe upcoming WrestleQuest is a great example of what you can do with wrestling games if you apply a bit of creativity. The title transforms the core concepts of the sport into a 16-bit RPG inspired by games like Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Trigger. It’s such a refreshing idea, and I can’t wait to see how it turns out when it launches later this year. WWE re…",

          "description": "After nearly 30 years of partnership, EA Sports and FIFA, the international governing body of association football, are parting ways after the release of this year's soccer video game. The announcement comes from a blog post from Electronic Arts that reveals what's next for the footie franchise.\nWith the current deal dissolving in 2023, EA will no longer use the FIFA name on its popular football series but will instead adopt the moniker of EA Sports FC. It's shedding any licensed identity in the name but still keeping many of its deals with existing football clubs and players. Cam Weber, General Manager of EA Sports, writes in the blog post, \"Everything you love about our games will be part of EA Sports FC – the same great experiences, modes, leagues, tournaments, clubs, and athletes will be there.\" \nOutside of potentially losing the use of the World Cup tournament, it's unclear what else might be missing in future iterations. However, EA is still boasting impressive numbers of players and teams involved moving forward.\nOur unique licensing portfolio of more than 19,000+ players, 700+ teams, 100+ stadiums, and 30 leagues that we’ve continued to invest in for decades will still be there, uniquely in EA Sports FC,\" says Weber. \"That includes exclusive partnerships with the Premier League, LaLiga, Bundesliga, Serie A, the MLS – and more to come.\"\nThis year's FIFA 23 sounds like it will be business as usual with more features, World Cup content, leagues, clubs, and more and won't be subject to any of these changes. Weber says that we'll have to wait until summer 2023 to hear more of what's to come for EA Sports FC.\nHow do you feel about this change in branding and partnership? Is FIFA just a name to you, or does it bring something special to EA's brand of virtual soccer? Let us know in the comments below!",

Respawn Entertainment, the development studio behind the Jedi title, is overseeing production for three different Star Wars games: a strategy title, a first-person shooter, and a sequel to Jedi.\nI don't know what to expect from the first two games, but I expect Jedi to be a direct sequel that reunites fans with protagonist Cal Kestis, who is still trying to find his place in a troubled time with the Empire on the rise. If Respawn goes in this direction, here's what I hope to see:\nThe Light and Dark Side of the Force\nForce Turmoil\nA Gruesome Death for the Poncho\nPlay as BD-1\nLarger Environments\nMore of the Same with the Lightsaber and Fighting\nA Connection to The Mandalorian\nThe Mandalorian show, but I didn't expect to see one from Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. Star Wars fans believe BD-1 was in the show, meaning he's been around for over twenty years. How awesome would it be to see BD-1 return to that location and show us why he was there in the first place?\nAnd now I'd like to hear what you want to see from Respawn's next Jedi game?

          "description": "The original Mass Effect trilogy is one of gaming's most celebrated epics, despite the controversial finale of the third chapter. Depending on players' choices, the fate of legendary protagonist Commander Shepard was either ambiguously hopeful or dismally tragic. Mass Effect Andromeda moved away from a Shepard-led story, and players have been eagerly awaiting any news about the next numbered installment. A Mass Effect 4 trailer dropped during the 2020 Game Awards and revealed everyone's favorite Asari Shadow Broker. And now, a new lithograph might be hinting at the return of the illustrious Commander. \nAccording to a VGC report, the initial description of a Mass Effect lithograph says it all: \"While Shepard and the survivors are left to pick up the pieces, fans are left wondering what’s next.\" YouTuber MrHulthen noted that the text was quickly swapped out for something less direct. It now reads, \"The threat of the Reapers might have been ended, but at great cost including Earth itself. While the survivors are left to pick up the pieces, fans are left wondering what’s next.\" Read the whole thing for yourself by clicking the link above. Could this sudden change mean that the Commander is coming back? Only time will tell, as Mass Effect 4 narrative details have been particularly scarce. \n\n\nOf course, BioWare isn't only working on its famed space opera. The next adventure in its high fantasy RPG franchise, Dragon Age, is on the way too. Similarly, story info for that game is few and far between, but excitement for both series couldn't possibly be higher. \n[Source: VGC]\nWould you like to star as Commander Shepard again?

According to the film's description, the two now have a family with kids of their own, and The Way of Water is the first of many new stories to chronicle \"the trouble that follows them, the lengths they go to keep each other safe, the battles they fight to stay alive, and the tragedies they endure.\" Previously we got to see how the Na'vi live and thrive in the lush jungles on the planet of Pandora. This time we see how they fare on the coast, in the oceans, and of course, in the skies above it. The humans are still around, too, and look to be up to no good with armed Na'vi or Avatars in their ranks.\nThe trailer, which you can watch above, has plenty of grandeur, drama, and action. It brings back memories of how gorgeous the setting of Avatar is, and the last shot of the trailer shows Cameron hasn't forgotten how to make a cool action sequence. He is responsible for Terminator 2 and Aliens, after all. If I wasn't sold on the idea of more Avatar before the trailer, seeing Jake surf into the skies on a flying crocodile with a huge gun in hand and an ax on his back was more than enough for me to buy a ticket when presales go live later this year. \nAvatar: The Way of Water stars Zoe Saldana, Sam Worthington, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang, Cliff Curtis, Joel David Moore, CCH Pounder, Edie Falco, Jemaine Clement, and Kate Winslet. It will be released in theaters on December 16, and yes, there will be a 3D version.\nAre you excited about Avatar: The Way of Water?

          "description": "Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness hit theaters Thursday and it’s doing quite well for Marvel Studios, scoring the biggest opening in 2022 thus far and claiming the 11th best domestic box office opening of all time. Critically, it’s been more divisive than one might guess, with many either being put off by how \"Sam Raimi\" the Doctor Strange sequel is or completely smitten with it as a result of the Evil Dead director’s style. \nIf you’ve seen the movie, you’ve likely noticed how unique it is in the pantheon of Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. It features more horror elements than ever before, and it introduces a lot of new concepts and ideas to the MCU. In fact, I think Multiverse of Madness sets up where the MCU is ultimately going later in Phase 4 and beyond. To speak any furthe…",

While it officially releases tomorrow, I've only had the game for the past weekend and have plenty more to explore. In lieu of a full review before the game launches, I present my initial impressions of Salt and Sacrifice, which are decidedly mixed after a dozen hours of hunting Mages.\nFollowing its predecessor's footsteps, Salt and Sacrifice hits a similar 2D Soulslike feel. After perishing in the opening moments, your character becomes Spellmarked, an entity that treads the line between life and death by the power of magic.

Unfortunately for them, that will soon come to an end. \nThe WWE Games Twitter account tweeted that on June 30, the online functions for both of those games will be shut down. 2K explains that doing so allows the team to give its full attention to supporting 2K22. Once the shutdown occurs, 2K19/20 players will be unable to play online, download/upload user-created content, or interact with presumably any other feature dependant on the servers.   \n📣 Attention WWE 2K community: On June 30, 2022, we will sunset support for WWE 2K19 & WWE 2K20 servers. This includes all online functions, such as online matches & Community Creations. We are turning our full focus toward supporting #WWE2K22. Thanks for your continued support! pic.twitter.com/vOJ06AA9iy\nMay 9, 2022\nWhile 2K20 is largely remembered as a disaster, 2K19 was generally well-liked, but both games haven’t exactly maintained bustling online communities. The average Steam player count for both games currently sits between 90-130 players, so it’s easy to understand why 2K would feel justified in sunsetting online support.\nFurthermore, WWE 2K22 garnered positive reviews (here's ours) and recently received the first pack of DLC wrestlers of its months-long roadmap. On paper, it behooves the team to bolster a game perceived as a relative return to form with updates as much as it can. It's undeniably a bummer to lose such a big function of the old titles for preservation purposes, if nothing else, but at least fans have plenty of time to squeeze in some online match-ups before the final bell tolls.",

          "description": "Gotham Knights might feature four-player co-op, if an updated PlayStation Network Store listing for the game is to be believed. \nGotham Knights, which lets players control either Nightwing, Batgirl, Robin, or Red Hood in a Gotham without its Batman, has marketed co-op as a feature since its reveal back in 2020. However, its co-op only supported up to two players. It seems that developer Warner Bros. Montreal, the studio behind Batman Arkham: Origins, might be looking to bump that number up. That’s because a new PSN listing for Gotham Knights lists the game as having four-player co-op, as reported by PCGamesN. \nAs you can see in the screenshot above (taken by Game Informer this morning), PlayStation lists the game as one that “supports up to 4 online players with PS Plus.” It even features the symbol and wording for “4 network players” beside that, further supporting the claim that Gotham Knights might feature four-player online co-op. However, as PCGamesN notes, the description for the game still says Gotham Knights can be experienced “in solo-play or with one other hero,” which sounds a lot like two-player co-op. \nPerhaps Warner Bros. Montreal has a surprise announcement up its sleeve, or maybe it is developing a mode separate from the campaign that supports four-player co-op. Only time will tell. \nFor more, check out this Gotham Knights gameplay walkthrough and then watch the latest trailer for Gotham Knights, which highlights the control of the Court of Owls. Read about how Gotham Knights was delayed to October after that. \n[Source: PCGamesN]\nDo you want four-player co-op in Gotham Knights? Let us know in the comments below!",

No longer will the Murlocs be the only amphibians making their presence known in the Battlegrounds. In total, Rise of the Naga will add 23 minions to the Battlegrounds pool of cards, all of which you can gaze upon below. \n\nSince Naga are the new hotness in Battlegrounds, that tribe will be receiving the most support, with 16 total Naga being added to the game. They'll mostly be the cards embued with Spellcraft, although there is one non-Naga with the ability. Five more minions of other types are joining the card pool as brand new minions, and two familiar faces will be making a return to the format. However, with all of these additions, there are going to be some subtractions; five minions will be retired from Battlegrounds as soon as patch 23.2 hits on Tuesday.\nHow much do you think the Naga will change the meta of Hearthstone Battlegrounds?

          "description": "A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. \nThe game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. \nWatch on Twitch!\nFallen Order was released on November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. \nJoin Marcus Stewart, Andrew Reiner, and Jill Grodt on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat. Just as a reminder, subscribing to Game Informer on Twitch rewards access to the official Game Informer Discord channel where you can interact with our lovely community as well as the editors.
