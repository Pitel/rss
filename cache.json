          "description": "A bountiful harvest.\nFans of Nintendo’s long-running Picross series are well aware that there’s no shortage of nonogram puzzlers on the Switch, with developer Jupiter and the Big N’s franchise alone accounting for over a dozen games and counting so far. Even so, there’s an addictive simplicity to the core concept that ensures that further entries will always be welcome, especially when they mix with popular IP like the Sega Genesis and, uh… Kemono Friends. Nintendo certainly doesn’t have a monopoly on the concept of a nonogram puzzle, either, leaving the door open for other publishers like Rainy Frog and developer Score Studio to introduce their own franchises that use the concept, such as Piczle Cross. The latest entry in the Piczle Cross series merges the timeless puzzling action with the chill vibes of the Story of Seasons franchise and though Piczle Cross: Story of Seasons isn’t exactly a revolutionary new entry in the genre, it still ticks all the boxes to provide a satisfying puzzle experience.\nGameplay in Piczle Cross could be most closely likened to a mixture of Minesweeper and sudoku puzzles, tasking the player with methodically deducing a solution by process of elimination. You’re presented with a grid that’s anywhere from 5x5 to 20x20 squares in size, with the edges of each row and column containing hint numbers that indicate how many squares you have to fill in. Which squares you need to fill in is always a mystery, however, so you need to use the hint numbers to carefully rule out which ones you can safely mark off and which need to be filled in. Puzzles can last anywhere from a few seconds to about 20 minutes apiece, with the final product always revealing some cute pixel art rendition of a random farm-related item or person.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

We were expecting to see both Hi-Fi RUSH and Sea of Thieves, but alas, while both of those have been confirmed for release on the PS5, there is currently no sign of them on Nintendo's platform.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Nearly five years after the release of Splatoon 2’s Octo Expansion, Agent Eight’s story continues in the drab and colourless world of the Memverse, but is it worth the train fare to reach this particular station?\nLet’s be blunt, Side Order is a roguelite, meaning there’s a series of semi-random levels you must beat sequentially in order to triumph. The catch? If you run out of lives, you’re sent right back to the start. Note the ‘t’ in the genre name, though, as unlike a roguelike, you can unlock bonuses and boons to make each subsequent run up the tower that little bit easier.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

After 11 years in development, Ubisoft's pirate game isn't necessarily a disaster, I just think its live service model has transformed piracy from a roguish lark on the waves into a tremendously dull series of shipping tasks.\nRead more",

Doom has burned through people's souls and minds, filling them with a desire to play Id Software's seminal shooter on every device they can. The question \"Can it run Doom?\" has driven these demonic vassals to make it playable on everything from tractors to teletext. These hellbound hearts are even daring to corrupt the totemic device of American liberty: the lawnmower. Come April, you will be able to play Doom on the Husqvarna Nera line of robotic automowers.

          "description": "Lil Guardsman is a game that wears its heart on its sleeve. In a victory for normative determinism, this is a fantasy adventure about a small girl named Lil who somehow becomes the first (and seemingly only) line of defence at a city’s border patrol as a guardsman. At various points, both Lil and those around her frequently call attention to the fact that, yes, you are merely a 12-year-old child who is massively underqualified for this task, and that if you’re going to continue filling in for your good for nothing father who’s down the pub gambling on the latest ball game, then really, what do your superiors expect? It’s very self-aware in that sense, and occasionally verges on breaking the fourth wall. This alone will probably be a fairly good indicator of whether you’ll gel with Lil Guardsman’s sense of humour or not, but for the most part, this is a sweet and jovial narrative adventure whose characterful animation and charming voice cast help bring this oddball tale of fate and consequence to life.\nIt's also not shy about where it’s taken its main source of inspiration from either. This is fantasy Papers, Please through and though, albeit one that’s more about interrogating and probing would-be citygoers for information than checking documents and spotting inconsistencies. During the day you’ll be working your post, dealing with the increasingly large, but fixed queues of fantasy species all trying to enter the city gate to go about their business. When you're off the clock, it's time to pick up the game's wider plotlines, with Lil able to travel around the city to set locations where she can chat with other townsfolk, sometimes partake in the odd mini-game or two, and visit the local shop before toddling off to bed. It’s admittedly quite a straightforward interpretation of Lucas Pope’s magnum opus, with star ratings denoting clear right and wrong answers for how you deal with each day’s horde, but you know what they say about first impressions. Good ones go a long way.\nRead more",

          "description": "Satan has vanished, the throne of hell lies empty, and eight Archfiends are all jostling to be its chief seat warmer. It's a great setup for a role-playing strategy game, and the allure of plotting, scheming, backstabbing and shmoozing your way to victory remains as enticing today as it did when Solium Infernum first came to PC in 2009. At the time, it launched to relative obscurity, and was mostly kept alive by dedicated play-by-email multiplayer groups. It was through one of these groups that Armello developers League Of Geeks first came into contact with it, and now, years later, have taken on the task of remaking Solium Infernum for a modern audience.\nThe original Solium was, by all accounts, an intensely knotty and dense affair, impenetrable to newcomers, or at least to those who were unprepared (or unwilling) to study and absorb all the countless variations and statistics involved in creating your own unique Archfiend. It was a bit like creating a D&D character sheet, only about ten times more complicated, and whose strategic implications may or may not have made themselves apparent until it was far too late. You could biff yourself before you began, in other words, and League Of Geeks have made admirable attempts to tame and streamline this unruly hell beast, doing away with a lot of that initial fussiness. As is perhaps fitting for the theme here, there are unfortunately still a few pesky gremlins causing mayhem behind the scenes at time of writing (I'm pointing the finger at literal bug queen Beelzebub for this), but for the most part, there's good fun to be had in this new incarnation of Solium Infernum - and particularly if you have some willing friends who you soon hope to call enemies.\nRead more",

          "description": "Last Epoch is, as has been observed many times, a kind of middle-ground ARPG. You hold down a button to evaporate hordes of enemies from a top down isometric perspective, but, in a step further than Diablo 4, it has more in-depth, any-time crafting for entry level percentage perverts to eke out incremental slivers of health regen vs. damage. At the same time, it's less complex than Path Of Exile, which is where advanced percentage perverts go when they die. Last Epoch has been in early access for a while now, so there's a decent chance that you already know what you think of it now it's in 1.0. If you haven't yet dipped your toe in, then I can tell you it's very decent. It makes building an extremely overpowered mega-wizard very easy, and I liked it better than Diablo IV, I think.\nRead more",

He was BioWare's general manager for several years, but left the company in 2017 following the release of the less-regarded Mass Effect: Andromeda. New survival sim Nightingale is his first early access project, and it's certainly been a learning experience, with Flynn obliged to rethink many of the things he learned about gamedev during his BioWare days. Speaking to me ahead of Nightingale's launch, Flynn talked about the difficulty of making headway as a new developer in an industry where the most successful competing live service titles have effectively become part of the landscape - indeed, a force of \"gravity\".\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Playing Pacific Drive reminds me of an army recruitment advert shown on British TV about 20 years ago. A group of soldiers are travelling along a road at night in a Land Rover, when suddenly they spot the enemy ahead. The front seat passenger starts barking orders at the driver: “Get off the road! Kill the lights! Through the trees!”. You sense the panic as the camera, inside the vehicle, jolts with the suspension on the rough ground, and the driver fights the steering wheel to stay in control. It’s a scene you reenact quite frequently in Ironwood’s survival game with roguelike trimmings. Well, except, instead of a Land Rover you’re behind the wheel of a rusty station wagon, and instead of military opposition, you’re scarpering from paranormal phenomena.\nRead more",

Well, the procedurally generated landscapes are engrossing, a blend of British fairytale influences with many a hushed forest, spidery swamp and tempting ruin. We're also pretty keen as a team on the game's Realm cards system, which lets you shape those fairytale worlds both before and after you portal into them. But we were less enthralled by HUD and user interface elements such as the crafting menus and hotbar, which we found ornate and circuitous to the point of confusing. \r\n\n\r\nSpeaking to me after our co-op hands-on - in which guides writer Kiera made friends with a tree monster only for somebody to shoot it - Inflexion's CEO Aaryn Flynn explained a bit about how the game will evolve during its early access period, which Inflexion estimate will last 9-12 months. Thankfully, it sounds like fine-tuning the UI is a priority, though Flynn is \"cautious\" about committing to a full-blown roadmap.\r\n \nRead more",

In 2022, I more or less had the music of Tunic and Citizen Sleeper on repeat whenever I left the house. In 2021, it was Chicory. In 2020, it was Coffee Talk and Signs Of The Sojourner, and in 2019, it was all Mutazione, all the time. 2023 was a pretty great year for game music as well, as we not only got Alan Wake 2's exquisite musical set-piece that's honestly just been getting better and more insane as time's gone on, frankly, but also the toe-tappingly brilliant soundtrack of Cobalt Core, which has somehow risen even higher on my forever playlist after revisiting it for this month's RPS Game Club.  \nComposed by Aaron Cherof, Cobalt Core's music alternates between high-energy battle tracks and calmer, more relaxed ambience. It's so dang good, and an absolutely perfect backdrop for sliding in and out of oncoming missile fire in its roguelike spaceship fights. So come along and jam to some of its best tracks with me below as I pick out some of my musical highlights.\nRead more",

          "description": "There's a particular boss encounter in Balatro that always feels like it's cheating a bit. In this mesmerising poker roguelike, each stage is made up of three blinds - small, big and boss - with the blind essentially being a high score you have to hit by playing different kinds of poker hands - your traditional flushes, straights, pairs and so on. Each hand has its own number of chips and multiplier bonuses associated with it, and Balatro's whole deal is about shuffling closer to victory by making the most of the cards you're dealt. While some blinds are tiny, stretching to just 300 or 450 early on in a run, they quickly start ramping up into the tens of thousands as each successfully defeated boss blind ups the ante and the accompanying stakes. Reach an ante of eight, and bingo, you've won a run of Balatro.\nThe boss blind I keep coming a cropper with, though, is The Flint. This sucker not only halves a hand's chip score, but it also cuts its multiplier in two as well, and I've yet to figure out exactly how to defeat it. Sometimes it appears with a blind of just 600, but other times it's been an enormous 22,000. In fairness, all bosses have little tricks like this. Some will debuff certain card suites, making them useless in your overall score count. Others may only let you play one hand type the entire match, while the cheeky Tooth will deduct you $1 for every card used. But Balatro isn't simply about beating the odds with smart and intelligent card plays. It's about bending, twisting and abusing those odds to your will - also through smart and intelligent card plays. Cheating isn't just encouraged in Balatro. It's damn near mandatory, and it's all thanks to the brilliantly conceived joker cards that give the game its Latin-based name.\nRead more",

Minor cards are played within worlds to mess with their workings.

It's what the Cobalt Core devs Rocket Rat Games made first, and you can immediately see a lot of shared DNA between the two games - not least its chunky, charming pixel visuals and some crossover between its cast of characters - including our pal Soggins. \nIt is, I should stress, a very different game to Cobalt Core - it's a sandboxy spaceship builder with zero combat involved, for starters - but I've been playing it again this week ahead of some other Game Club-themed articles I've got cooking, and I've been having a lovely time with it.

          "description": "I'm kind of fascinated by what happened to Hello Neighbor. The original, a stealth horror game against a creepy AI that learned your likely movements, was hugely popular in alpha in 2016. The series was acquired by TinyBuild in 2020, and since then there has been a heroic number of spin-offs. There's one set in an amusement park, a multiplayer game called Secret Neighbor in which one small child is actually a large adult man in disguise, a direct sequel called Hello Neighbor 2, and a VR game called Search And Rescue. I think everyone got a bit of Neighbor fatigue there, lads.\nThis might include the original creator Nikita Kolesnikov, as (still under the auspices of TinyBuild) he's made a new thing. Currently on Steam for playtesting, the project currently known as RBO isn't falling far from the home invasion tree, as players will either be a home-owning Protector - a McCallister, if you will - or an Intruder, or Wet Bandit.\nRead more",

After nearly a decade of delays, you’d probably just want to get it out the door, right? Skip straight to the open-world pirate adventuring, none of that 'making it work on a range of graphics cards' nonsense.\nBut nope. For all its other shortcomings, Skull and Bones performs alright on PC, very often more smoothly than its system requirements suggest. Though I’d still recommend abiding by its SSD storage requirement – following the rules might not be very piratey, but installing on a hard drive will curse you to some pretty tedious load screen waits. Geoffrey Rush would hate it, honestly.\nWhile Edwin sequesters himself in the starting area, let’s head below deck for a closer look at Skull and Bones’ PC particulars. That includes a full rundown of its graphics options – which include ray tracing and DLSS – and a quick guide to the best settings for an ideal prettiness-to-performance ratio.\n Read more",

During today's Age of Empires New Year, New Age Livestream, Microsoft unveiled Age of Empires Mobile which is coming to both iOS and Android\n\n\n\n\nDeveloped by TiMi Studios, Age of Empires Mobile brings the classic RTS genre to mobile devices for the first time ever. Featuring several different civilizations including China, Rome, France, and Byzantine, players will be able to choose from over 40 heroes to raise an army and conquer others.\n\n\nVisually Age of Empires Mobile actually looks pretty good. I know mobile graphics have come a long way, but I sort of expected it to just look like Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition but it actually looks better.\n\n\nUnfortunately, I'm not completely sold on the gameplay. Even though several scenes showed what looked to be pretty similar to authentically classic Age of Empires gameplay that we've come to love over the many years, other scenes showed what looked to be pretty normal markers of current mobile \"Pay to Win\" trends like a VIP Level, timers (that can be skipped for a cost, I'm sure), and more. Hopefully, I'm just being paranoid.

There's also Mother 3, a really good RPG from what I've heard, that still hasn't made it to the west. \n\n\nEver since it came out in 2006 for the Game Boy Advance, fans have been begging Mother series creator Shigesato Itoi for an official English release. We've recently learned that Mother 3 will be coming to Nintendo Switch Online, but still only in Japan. Western fans naturally clamored for a Western release, which got him to make a tweet asking fans to ask Nintendo, not him.\n\n\n\n\nBy looking at the Tweet above alone, it's hard to infer whether he's just politely saying that there's nothing he can do about it, or if he really wants us to beg louder for Nintendo to get Mother 3 to spread all over the world. \n\n\nEither way, Twitter user Lone translated a letter by Itoi that seems to vent his innermost thoughts and feelings about the game, and it sure does look like the man would be really happy if we got to play Mother 3.\n\n\n\n\nFreeing Mother 3 from its GBA-shaped prison and putting it on the Switch is great. This rocks not just for the instant gratification of Japanese fans, but also for gaming preservation purposes — even if it's only coming out digitally. Still, it's a total bummer that there's no news of a possible English port.\n\n\nIn any case, fans have infamously, notoriously found ways to still play lauded games that never came over to the West. And maybe, right now, that's still the best solution for someone just dying to play them. Or, if you just don't want to wait on a western release of Mother 3, then perhaps it's time to finally learn Japanese.\n\nThe post Mother creator asks fans to question Nintendo about Mother 3, not him appeared first on Destructoid.",

Mythology takes the foundation of Age of Empires but adds a mystical twist to it, allowing players to call upon various gods to help them in combat. Greek, Norse, Egyptian, and Atlantean pantheons are all options in Age of Mythology. \n\n\nAs great as Age of Empires is, there has always been something special to me about Age of Mythology. Being able to summon Nidhogg or call in a massive thunderstorm not only felt fun but felt like it added a unique element to the RTS genre.\n\n\nAge of Mythology: Retold is primarily a graphical upgrade to the original, mixing its classic gameplay elements with modernized visuals. It will include the 50-mission campaign as well as an all-new Arena of the Gods feature that allows you to complete all new trials either solo or co-op with friends as you take on challenges as the gods themselves battle it out.\n\n\nWhile no specific release date was given, Microsoft Game Studios did indicate Age of Mythology: Retold will be released later this year on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and be available Day One on Game Pass.\n\nThe post Age of Mythology: Retold is a definitive version of the classic RTS, out later this year appeared first on Destructoid.",

Did we really expect anything different?\n\n\nAccording to the promotional images for Connecting Worlds, the one-hour-long documentary features \"A visionary journey into the creation of Death Stranding.\"\n\n\n I've always been a fan of behind-the-scenes-style game-dev documentaries. It's always fun to see the truly creative process of game development first-hand.  Based on the trailer it looks like a bit of Kojima praising mixed with some actual behind-the-scenes, so maybe I'll give it a whirl.\n\n\nThink Geoff Keighley will make an appearance?\n\n\nDeath Stranding: Connecting Worlds is available to stream now on Disney+, Hulu, and Hotstar depending on region.\n\nThe post Hideo Kojima’s Death Stranding documentary is available for streaming now appeared first on Destructoid.",

While you do work as a trolleybus conductor, and your job is mostly to issue tickets and collect fare, you also spend much of your time engaging in mortal combat with rule breakers. To my knowledge, this isn’t something that conductors regularly do, but maybe things are different in Moldova.\n\n\n\n\nBoth the art style and the general concept of Troleu remind me of Night of the Consumers. Maybe that is the main influence, but the change of vocation completely alters the focus of the game. A big focus of its trailer is on kicking Soviets and misogynists screaming out the door.\n\n\nThe concept sounds like it will only support a short experience – which might be true, as that tends to be what the developer is known for – but the press release suggests that you’ll be visiting a number of locales. It says, “From bustling city streets to tranquil suburbs, every route presents its own set of challenges and surprises.”\n\n\nAndrground is well known for their short horror work, Elevated Dread, which is, coincidentally, the state of mind I perpetually exist in.\n\n\nTroleu doesn’t really have a release date, so you’ll have to survive by watching the trailer repeatedly, as I have.\n\nThe post Troleu looks like an accurate representation of the carnage of public transit appeared first on Destructoid.",

It literally takes seconds to enter.\n\n\nThere is actually a second chance of winning.

Along with some new content coming in March, the asymmetrical survival game is also throwing up the horns for heavy metal.\n\n\nFor all you metalheads out there (yo!), this one's for you. Dead by Daylight just launched a special collection that takes cues from the legendary Iron Maiden. More specifically, there are a number of outfits inspired by the band's Eddie mascot.\n\n\n\n\nThe above video has announced that the collection is out now via the in-game store. You can get such variations as the Dredge, the Doctor, the Deathslinger, and the Oni. There are also some rare tour shirts for the original Survivors.\n\n\nThe download of the beast\n\n\nI suppose something like this was bound to happen eventually. Horror and heavy metal go hand-in-hand. There's just something about the loud and rebellious sound of rockin' guitars and violent video games that makes them such good bedfellows. I mean, just look at Brutal Legend (disappointing though that was).\n\n\nThis isn't even the first time Iron Maiden has graced the world of gaming, either. Back in 2016, Nodding Frog Ltd released Legacy Beast RPG, a fantasy, turn-based role-playing game for mobile. Then there was the video game/greatest hits album Ed Hunter, released in 1999.\n\n\nIn short, Bruce Dickinson and co are not exactly strangers to our world, and Eddie joining Dead by Daylight sounds like a pretty good match.

Not only is it reviving a beloved series for football fans, but it's also bringing all 134 FBS (formerly Division I-A) schools along for the ride.\n\n\nIt's no Mutant Football League, but it'll do\n\n\nFirst released as Bill Walsh College Football in 1993, the series was renamed College Football USA in 1996, and NCAA Football in 1998. Then, the NCAA opted not to renew its licensing contract with EA in 2013 due to a legal dispute regarding player likenesses. Despite plans to continue under the College Football name, EA put a pause on the series after several conferences revoked their licenses with the publisher.\n\n\nScreenshot via EASPORTSCollege on X\n\n\nOn February 2, 2021, the official EASPORTSCollege X account made a post stating \"College Football is coming back.\" Fast forward to this morning with the announcement that all 134 FBS schools would be in the next entry in the series, College Football 25.\n\n\nAdditionally, per The Athletic, players on any of the teams within the included 134 FBS schools can opt-in for inclusion in the title. In return, they'll receive $600 and a copy of the game. Initial rosters will include up to 85 players and those who don't opt-in will have a generic avatar as their stand-in. The Athletic anticipates at least 11,000 players to be represented, so EA would be shelling out $6.6M at minimum if they all opt in. With that kind of payout, EA needs to ship a massive number of copies to recoup costs.\n\n\nFortunately for the publisher, college football in the States is a huge business, with individual teams in the Big Ten generating upwards of $134M a year.

Publisher 2P Games announced that the latest from developer WHIRLLAXY LIMITED is set to launch on Nintendo Switch and PC (via Epic Games Store) on March 7, 2024.\n\n\nAny of the ideas here might not be novel on their own, but the trailer certainly has my interest piqued. I'll admit, a lot of that has to do with the visuals. Yes, it's another pixel art roguelite, but so far I'm digging the designs, effects, and how it all appears to work in tandem with the core customization mechanic. \n\n\nThrow in a plot to liberate your fellow robots and overthrow an organization full of crooked politicians, scientists, engineers, and secret agents and you have my attention.\n\n\n\n\nThe aforementioned nogoodniks at the corporation known as AWC are looking to remove sentience from robots and exercise total control over every single automaton. Naturally, that means you have to build your own transforming mecha with the help of more than 100 weapons and a variety of core component mods. The weapons can range from rapid-fire naval artillery to flaming chainsaws and laser cannons, and they can be augmented with mods that address overheating issues, raise your firing rate, and more. \n\n\nThe level of randomization that comes along with weapon and mod pickups moves Metal Mind firmly into roguelite territory, hopefully keeping each run interesting Beyond that, it looks like the meat of the game lies in mixing and matching what you find and the top-down combat that follows. When Metal Mind makes its way to Switch and Epic Games Store it'll be priced at $17.99 with a 15% discount at launch.\n\nThe post Transforming mech roguelite Metal Mind is coming to Switch and PC on March 7 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "D4 Enterprise is continuing the pace of PC-88 games releasing on Switch under their EggConsole label with 1987’s Hydlide3: The Space Memories. Like many of their recent releases, it has the caveat of being untranslated.\n\n\nA couple months ago, we got the first Hydlide. Not having a translation was fine there since it didn’t have much text to begin with, but Hydlide3 has menus, stat windows, and dialogue that relies on knowledge of Japanese. It’s probably still doable without knowledge of the language, but it could be more comfortable.\n\n\n\n\nThe Hydlide series is sometimes thought of as a progenitor of the JRPG, predating Dragon Quest, though the combat is Ys-style bumping rather than turn-based. Hydlide 3, however, has an attack button, which does away with the bumping and makes it feel more akin to Zelda. There’s also a day/night system and even morality.\n\n\nA port for the Genesis/Mega Drive actually made its way to North America under the title Super Hydlide. Whether it’s good or not depends on your tastes. Both contemporary and recent critics suggest that it’s a very difficult game, and some like its hardcore flavor while others are repulsed by it. Me? I haven’t played it, but I’m probably going to. I’ve said this before, but while rereleasing untranslated games from a Japanese home computer is catering to an extremely niche audience, it’s one that I fit into.\n\n\nEggConsole Hydlide3 PC-8801mkIISR is out today on Switch.\n\nThe post Hydlide3 is today’s PC-88 EggConsole release appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "For those of you with conflicting feelings about making calamari of your fellow Octolings and Inklings, you can rejoice as Wave 2 of the Splatoon 3 Expansion Pass, Side Order, launched today. With none of that nasty PvP business, you can focus on ethically annihilating other species.\n\n\nYou got Nier: Automata in my Splatoon 3 DLC!\n\n\nThe Splatoon 3 Expansion Pass was announced during the February 2023 Nintendo Direct. Priced at $24.99 and divided into two waves, players were able to return to the original Splatoon hub, Inkopolis, in Wave 1. It didn't feature a whole lot of new content aside from the Squid Sisters performing during Splatfests and thus, was underwhelming for those without a strong sense of nostalgia.\n\n\n\n\nSide Order puts players in control of Agent 8 who must figure out why Inkopolis Square has been drained of color. Working with Pod, err... Pearl, Agent 8 works up each level of The Spire of Order, much like Aya Brea in Parasite Eve's Chrysler Building back in 1998. \n\n\nDesigned as a roguelite, players must ascend as far as possible, collecting Color Chip Enhancements along the way and completing objectives. On each floor, players choose one of three objectives to complete. Each choice gives a Color Chip Enhancement, which goes onto the overall palette and offers a wide range of buffs and modifiers. When you eventually fall, your Chips will be converted into Prlz which can be spent on permanent upgrades. It's your standard roguelite and while it's not Vampire Survivors, it's no slouch either.\n\n\nIn the wake of other, arguably larger, Nintendo news, like practically everything announced yesterday during Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase, it's understandable that Wave 2 of the Splatoon 3 Expansion Pass would slide under the radar. Regardless, if you've been looking for a reason to get back into Splatoon 3, this is it.\n\nThe post Splatoon 3’s Side Order DLC is out today appeared first on Destructoid.",

It would seem that a new developer and a slight name change weren't enough to save the third-person MOBA from a second death.\n\n\nRule #2: Double Tap\n\n\nThe Netmarble team made the announcement on February 21 that Paragon: the Overprime would be shutting down on April 22, 2024. This is a little over a year since the title went into early access on December 8, 2022. The reasoning for the decision is the inability \"...to provide a stable and satisfying service moving forward.\"\n\n\nImage via Netmarble\n\n\nThis isn't the first time that the Paragon franchise has heard the death knell. After launching in March 2016, the MOBA was shut down in March 2018, following an official Reddit post stating that a number of staff had been moved to Fortnite in the wake of its massive success. After being shut down, Epic Games released $17M worth of Paragon assets for free to all Unreal Engine 4 developers, including 29 characters and over 1,500 environment components.\n\n\nDespite a few other studios making use of the Paragon assets, Epic Games ultimately granted Netmarble the full rights to the license in October 2022, which led to the studio's title being rebranded Paragon: The Overprime. With the release of a new hero, Terra, less than a month ago, this end-of-service announcement seems abrupt. Either way, if you're a long-time fan or were mildly curious, now is the time to jump in as the servers will go dark in April.\n\n\nParagon: The Overprime - End of Service Schedule\n\n\n\nFebruary 22, 2024: Purchasing end\n\n\nApril 22, 2024: Service ends\n\n\nApril 29, 2024: Social media and official communities end\n\n\nAugust 22, 2024: Customer service ends\n\n\nThe post Paragon: The Overprime is shutting down appeared first on Destructoid.",

From Final Fantasy VII to SpongeBob SquarePants, this compelling cleaning sim is willing to tackle dirt no matter where it may be. Following a series of teasing posts on X by the PowerWash Simulator account, we finally have a release date for what might be the most ambitious crossover yet, Warhammer 40,000.\n\n\nUse the might of the powerwasher to purge the unclean\n\n\nPowerWash Simulator leaps to the 41st Millennium to clean the various instruments of death and destruction of the Warhammer 40,000 universe on February 27, 2024. Players will be able to clean everything from a Rogal Dorn battle tank to an Imperial Knight and even an entire Sacristan Forgeshrine. There isn't a price listed yet, but I would expect it to be in line with other, non-Square Enix, collaborations at $7.99.\n\n\n\n\nI'll admit that I know next to nothing about Warhammer 40,000, but my love for powerwashing might lead me down a dangerous path of learning deep lore and using my savings account on minis. As I trade in my gills from Bikini Bottom for a sacred MKII Aqua-Santica Arquebus powerwasher, I step into a world filled with fanaticism, endless war, and utterly filthy machines.\n\n\nEven if I ultimately don't fall head over heels in love with Warhammer 40,000, I'll take any excuse to boot up one of my favorite titles and zone out to the hum of a powerwasher.

          "description": "Final Fantasy VII Rebirth hits PlayStation 5 exclusively on February 29, but reviews for Square Enix's latest entry in its Final Fantasy VII remake trilogy dropped yesterday. We enjoyed the game a lot, and you can read about why in Game Informer's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth review. It turns out, a lot of reviewers enjoyed the game too, because at the time of this writing, it's the second-highest rated game in the Final Fantasy series on Metacritic, as noted by video game sales analyst Benji-Sales on X (formerly Twitter). \nCurrently sitting at a 93 on Metacritic, which aggregates various reviews into a single Metacritic score, only one other Final Fantasy game has been rated higher: Final Fantasy IX on PlayStation 1. It has a 94 on Metacritic.\nThere’s only 6 Final Fantasy games that have gone above a 90 Metacritic score.\npic.twitter.com/8PvD3wfpvZ\nFebruary 22, 2024\nAs you can see above, with a 93 on Metacritic, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth joins a prestigious list of games in the series with a Metacritic score of 90 or higher, as pointed out by AndSpaceY on X. Now, it's important to note that some Final Fantasy games are not rated on Metacritic as the aggregate site was not around when they released. For example, Final Fantasy VI is one of the most beloved entries in the franchise and arguably the best – released in 1994 on the SNES, Metacritic was not around at the time so it does not have a rating on the site. \nStill, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth rating so high is another example of how Square Enix's Final Fantasy VII remake project is landing with both critics and fans alike. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth review and then check out our Final Fantasy VII Rebirth cover story hub for exclusive features, videos, and more.

It received middling reviews – read Game Informer's review here to find out why we gave it a 6 out of 10 – and fans have been less-than-impressed with the shooter. It seems Warner Bros. Discovery is less-than-impressed, too, as the company said in its latest financial call that Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League had \"fallen short of our expectations,\" as reported by IGN. \n\n\nMore specifically, that's Warner Bros. Discovery chief financial officer Gunnar Wiedenfels who said Rocksteady's latest effort fell short of the company's expectations. However, Wiedenfels did not mention a sales figure. According to IGN, the executive lamented that Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League's missed expectations set Warner Bros.' games division up for a tough year when it comes to year-on-year comparisons.\nWiedenfels is likely alluding to Hogwarts Legacy, the company's massive hit that launched last year and went on to become the best-selling game of 2023, beating out titles like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. The sales of Hogwarts Legacy was certainly a tough act for Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League to follow. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's review of Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, and then check out Game Informer's list of the best superhero games of all time.

          "description": "It’s been a long time since Little Devil Inside, a promising survival action RPG from indie developer Neostream, has made any noise. The game’s last substantial update came in October 2021. But after over two years of silence, Neostream has come back with a new trailer and cryptic update hinting at what’s been going on with the team.\nAs reported by The Indie Informer, Neostream’s Kickstarter post, published yesterday, apologizes for the lack of updates and cryptically alludes to an internal conflict within the team, potentially due to clashing visions about the game, being one of the causes. It states in part,\nThe rest of Neostream's update indicates the team has reduced in size but confirms that the founders and core members remain at the studio. The studio assures backers that Little Devil Inside still exists and that it is currently discussing publishing before it can give fans a more substantial update. Until then, the team has prepared a six-minute montage video showing off the game running in Unreal Engine 5.\n\n\nLittle Devil Inside was first revealed way back in 2015 with the launch of its Kickstarter campaign, but it gained its first mainstream recognition as part of the 2020 PlayStation 5 showcase prior to the console's launch. You play as an explorer who embarks on research mission at the behest of a university professor to explore a large world filled with beasts both real and supernatural. You'll visit different towns along the way to meet quirky citizens, defend yourself from threats with a sword, and engage in survival mechanics like camping and cooking. Despite how much time as past, we ultimately still know relatively little about Little Devil Inside but it has remained a charmer each time it resurfaces. \nLittle Devil Inside has no release window but we're hoping to learn more concrete details in the near future.",

However, Sony has revealed it is currently testing PC support for PS VR2, with hopes to make that support available this year. \n\"[We're] pleased to share that we are currently testing the ability for PS VR2 players to access additional games on PC to offer even more game variety in addition to the PS VR2 titles available through PS5,\" a new PlayStation Blog post published today reads. \"We hope to make this support available in 2024, so stay tuned for more updates.\"\n\n\nThe rest of the blog goes on to detail new and upcoming titles coming to PS VR2, but those are going to be playable with PlayStation 5 consoles.

While we still don’t know when it’s coming, we do get another look at it in a new trailer.\n\n\nThe 2D 2v2 tag-team fighter looks very promising based on today’s footage. The game takes cues from Marvel vs Capcom in its assist-focused tag team play and utilizes more simplified inputs to lower the barrier for entry while maintaining strategic depth. Based on previous updates, online play features rollback netcode. Set in the world of Runterra, 2XKO features a roster of League of Legends champions, including Darius, Ekko, Ahri, and Yasuo. As Riot states on the game’s website, it’s still “heads down” working on updates to share, so a release window may not be coming in the near future. \n2XKO was first announced as Project L in 2019 alongside other League of Legends projects, including what would later become Valorant and LoL: Wild Rift. Hopefully, it will cross the finish line sooner than later. What do you think of the game's official title and this fresh look at gameplay? Let us know in the comments.",

You can capture Pokémon-like monsters called Pals in special balls (and you can capture humans, too), but it's smart to shoot them or hack at them with an axe first to lower their health. And then, once under your command, you can give them their own guns to use, of course. \nFollowing various trailers since that 2021 reveal, including this gameplay showcase and this one highlighting the different Pals you can find, we learned at Geoff Keighely's Summer Game Fest last year that Palworld would finally…",

Now, it's time for a new fighter from a different universe to join the roster. John Cena's Peacemaker, the hero that first appeared in 2021's The Suicide Squad and later in his epoynomous HBO Max series, joins the game next week on February 28. \nAhead of his release, NetherRealm Studios has released the first look at Peacemaker's gameplay in Mortal Kombat 1, and it features a lot of justice, a lot of peace, and, of course, a lot of blood. \nCheck out the Peacemaker gameplay trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, Peacemaker is voiced by Cena himself and features moves inspired by the character's live-action counterpart. That includes the fatality, which starts with Peacemaker ripping Quan-Chi in half by way of jet pack before sonic booming the rest of his body into bits. \nPeacemaker hits the Mortal Kombat 1 roster on February 28 for those who own the Premium Edition of the game or the Kombat Pack. Peacemaker goes live for individual purchase on March 6. \nElsewhere in this trailer, we learn that Janet Cage is joining the game as a new Kameo fighter in March – she's an alternate version of Johnny Cage from a different reality. We also learn that crossplay (or Krossplay as NetherRealm calls it) will go live on February 28, allowing PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store) players to fight against each other in-game. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Mortal Kombat 1 review. \nAre you going to play as Peacemaker in Mortal Kombat 1 next week?

First announced in 2015, the live-action film brings Gearbox’s popular co-op loot shooter to life with some big-name stars, bigger explosions, and (hopefully) even bigger laughs. \n\n\nDirected by Eli Roth, the film stars Cate Blanchett (Lilith), Kevin Hart (Roland), Jack Black (Claptrap), Edgar Ramírez (Atlas), Ariana Greenblatt (Tiny Tina), Florian Munteanu (Krieg), Gina Gershon (Moxxi), and Jamie Lee Curtis (Tannis). Like the games, the film follows our group of Vault Hunters as they search for a valuable relic on the desert planet of Pandora. They also stumble upon a missing girl with a powerful secret that could endanger the universe. \nBorderlands hits theaters on August 9.",

Rare’s shared-world sea-faring pirate game is heading to PlayStation 5 on April 30.\nSea of Thieves joins Hi-Fi Rush, Grounded, and Pentiment as the four Xbox titles going multiplatform, each confirmed today. The PlayStation 5 version supports crossplay with Xbox and PC. “Something we’ve always been passionate about is that idea that we should remove barriers that prevent players from playing together,” says game director Mike Chapman in an announcement video below. \n\n\nAs associate design director Shelly Preston points out in the video, this marks the first time in Rare’s nearly 40-year history that it’s released a game on PlayStation, which is a wild milestone. Since first launching to a tepid reaction in 2018, various updates and expansions have improved Sea of Thieves and fostered a dedicated community of players. PlayStation 5 players have the benefit of jumping into a now-content-rich game from the get-go.",

Hi-Fi Rush, a rhythm-action title from the studio behind The Evil Within and Ghostwire: Tokyo, is joining the PlayStation 5 library, as confirmed by Xbox Wire.\nHi-Fi Rush surprise launched on Xbox Series X/S and PC in January 2023, quickly becoming a critical darling and fan favorite. While many were shocked the colorful game was created by the horror developers at Tango Gameworks, fans quickly fell in love with the stylish combat, beautiful presentation, and fun integration of music.\nHi-Fi Rush arrives on PS5 on March 19. According to reporting by The Verge, the final previously exclusive game jumping across the aisle is Sea of Thieves. Hi-Fi Rush took home Game Informer's 2023 \"Best Microsoft Exclusive\" award and, as of this writing, has a spot on our Top 10 Xbox Series X Games list.

Blending the adventure genre with a gorgeous storybook aesthetic, Pentiment was a critical darling when it launched on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC in 2022. Now, a new stable of players will have the chance to experience the title, as it is coming to Switch tomorrow.\nPentiment puts you in control of Andreas Maler, a 16th-century artist from Nuremberg who finds himself in the middle of several murder mysteries. Taking place over the course of 25 years, you must investigate the murders, collect physical proof, interview townsfolk, and accuse who you think committed the crime based on the evidence you gather. \nWhen it launched on Xbox in PC, Pentiment earned an 86 on reviews aggregate sites Metacritic and OpenCritic. Game Informer's Charles Harte felt similarly, awarding it an 8.5 out of 10, saying Pentiment is \"a perfect example of this, telling a deep, complex story about religion, truth, and history in the form of a book, which the player experiences as it’s being written. Despite a few sections with inconsistent pacing, it’s a must-play for fans of adventure games.\"\nPentiment arrives on Nintendo Switch tomorrow, February 22. For more on the title, be sure to check out our review here. Pentiment joins Grounded as previous Xbox exclusives to come to Switch. According to Xbox's Phil Spencer, there are four games in total that will arrive on additional platforms in the near future.

Bandai Namco is also releasing a physical version of the game, the Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree Collector's Edition, which includes a statue and other goodies.\nYou can check out the trailer below.\n\n\nThe trailer begins by focusing on a setting where an optional boss appeared in the main game and where you can find Miquella's egg. The trailer shows new monsters and bosses, like a lion creature with a rotating head and another made entirely of flames. There are also new abilities, items, and weapons, one of which appears to be a roaring bear's head. There is also some kind a porcupine alligator creature and the player character sprouted angel wings in one fight. Those are just a few of the standout reveals.\n\nThe game's official product page does confirm a few additional details, like the name of the main boss seems to be Mesmer the Impaler. Shadow of the Erdtree is also not standalone despite carrying a $39.99 price tag. The page refers to it as an expansion and it will require the base game.

          "description": "Some may look at an early clip of Kingmakers and think they already know what to expect: tactical battles in which you command medieval armies across sweeping battlefields. And that’s partially true. But this new title by Redemption Road Games features an unexpected and absolutely absurd twist.\nWe’ll let the trailer speak for itself.\n\n\nIn Kingmakers, you control a soldier from a dying world in the future. To save your present, you must travel 500 years in the past to medieval England to change the course of a war to prevent a later apocalypse.\nSince the protagonist evidently has no regard for blending in, he arrives fully strapped with modern weaponry such as assault rifles, shotguns, grenade launchers, armored vehicles, and even helicopters to blow these knights back to Camelot. You’ll command your own medieval army, with gameplay seamlessly switching between zoomed-out RTS-style view to issue commands to various units and more action-focused third-person shooting.  \nRedemption Road Games states Kingmaker’s armies are fully simulated by a next-generation multithreaded A.I. This allows them to execute advanced pathfinding, decision-making, and even a loyalty system, with a procedurally generated animation system helping bring the mobs to life. Kingmakers also feature co-op with up to three other players. Each ally commands their own army to work together to topple enemy fortresses or defend friendly strongholds. \nRedemption Road Games states in an X post that it has been working on Kingmakers for the last five years. It looks wild and is certainly a refreshing concept. Hopefully, it’s as fun as it looks, and we'll find out when it launches to PC via Steam sometime this year.",

Today, we got an answer: Lady Gaga, who will be coming to the game in some kind of collaboration this Thursday, February 22. Notably, the image released specifically says \"Fortnite Festival,\" implying the crossover might be linked to the game's musical mode, likely in the form of instrument skins and songs.\nThe funniest part about this announcement is the manner in which it was announced. In 2019, Lady Gaga tweeted, \"what is fortnight,\" either misspelling the popular video game or talking about something else entirely. Now, over four years later, she's corrected that spelling mistake with an asterisk while simultaneously announcing her appearance in the game.\n*fortnite https://t.co/1FwPHmMfRJ pic.twitter.com/9BSG6S23zh\nFebruary 20, 2024\nFortnite is the biggest game in the world, and it's getting even bigger in the future, thanks to a 1.5 billion-dollar investment from Disney.

I recently played the upcoming revival, called Gigantic: Rampage Edition, and wished my session didn’t have to end. As an ardent fan of the original, jumping back into Gigantic is invigorating. Explosive fights erupt across the map’s many paths and objectives as each team races to expose and defeat the opposing squad’s Guardian with stylish spells and ultimate abilities. Notably, Gearbox Publishing is leaving the original’s free-to-play structure in the rearview, ditching microtransactions altogether for a $19.99 premium version featuring two new heroes, additional maps, console and PC cross-play, and updated gameplay systems.\nWatch The Gigantic: Rampage Edition Announcement Trailer:\n\n\nNotably, Game Informer's original Gigantic review wasn't as positive as I personally felt about the game.

Not every project is a hit, but there have been enough success stories that learning about a new film or TV show in the works doesn't instantly fill fans with dread. The latest example of that growing trend is the live-action Borderlands movie, which we just got our first official looks at, thanks to People.\nThis image shows the main line-up of the movie. Going clockwise, starting from the top left, Ariana Greenblatt is Tiny Tina, Florian Munteanu is Krieg, Jamie Lee Curtis is Tannis, Jack Black is the voice of Claptrap, Kevin Hart is Roland, and Cate Blanchett takes the lead role as Lilith. You can see a head-on image of her character below.\nThis film has been in the works for a while now, but outside of these images, there's not much new information. If you haven't seen it yet (or just need a refresher, since it's been over two years), here's the official synopsis from a 2021 press release:\nIGN also shared the movie's first official poster.\nHere's the exclusive new poster for the @BorderlandsFilm!\n\nRead what director @eliroth and Gearbox founder Randy Pitchford (@DuvalMagic) had to tell us about bringing the classic looter shooter game to the big screen: https://t.co/NNw83A3xuX #BorderlandsMovie #IGNFanFest pic.twitter.com/TBnRH1tsdn\nFebruary 20, 2024\nBorderlands, directed by actor/director Eli Roth, hits theaters August 9.\nWhat do you think of these new images?

Nintendo states in a press release that it will showcase “Nintendo Switch games coming in the first half of 2024 from our publishing and development partners.”\nIgnoring the faint voice in my head whispering, “Hollow Knight: Silksong”, these are some noteworthy games with actual confirmed release dates within that window that could appear:\nInkulinati\nUnicorn Overlord\nGylt\nHighwater\nSouth Park: Snow Day!\nOpen Roads\nBotany Manor\nTales of Kenzera: Zau\nSaGa Emerald Beyond\nBraid: Anniversary Collection\nNumerous third-party games slated for 2024 lack release dates, so there’s always a chance some of those could get launch windows or new trailers, at least. Some big ones include Contra: Operation Galuga, Decapolice, the long-awaited Switch port of Kingdom Come: Deliverance, Little Nightmares III, Neva, Pepper Grinder, Star Wars: Hunters, Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution, and The Plucky Squire.\nOr we could also find out which of those four mysterious first-party Xbox games now going multiplatform is heading to Switch. Just a thought. \nOf course, there’s likely to be at least a few brand-new game announcements. Hopefully, it will be a fruitful Direct, and we luckily don’t have too much longer to wait and find out.

          "description": "As promised earlier this week, Microsoft and Xbox executives Phil Spencer (head of Xbox), Sarah Bond (president, Xbox) and Matt Booty (Head of Xbox Game Studios) got together today to share some important \"updates on the Xbox business.\" You can check out the full update below, but the headline is that four future formerly Xbox and PC exclusive games are coming to other consoles, but Spencer was not ready to reveal what those games are. They are games that are more than a year old that have been on Xbox and PC for awhile. A couple of the games, Spencer says, are community-driven and service-based games that have reached their full potential on Xbox and PC. They are franchises that Xbox wants to continue to invest in. Two are smaller games that were not built to be platform exclusives. Though he wasn't ready to share the game titles, he did confirm that Starfield and Indiana Jones are not in that group.\nAccording to sources reported by The Verge, it seems the four titles may be Hi-Fi Rush, Pentiment, Sea of Thieves, and Grounded.\nSpencer cushioned everything he said, presumably in expectation of pushback from Xbox fans by saying, “We make every decision with the long term health of Xbox in mind.” He also made sure to remind everyone that Xbox already has games on other platforms, calling out Minecraft in particular. Spencer also briefly touched on the company's decision to lay off over 1900 employees, though offered little in terms of reasonable rationalization.\nBond also mentioned that Xbox is looking forward to and making plans surrounding future hardware and vaguely promised a substantial leap in technical prowess, but offered little in terms of concrete details.\n\n\nThe podcast also confirmed Activision/Blizzard games are coming to Game Pass starting with Diablo IV on March 28 and that we can expect a new Xbox showcase in June.",

          "description": "It’s been three years since EA announced it was making a new college football game after a years-long hiatus. Dubbed EA Sports College Football 25, not much has materialized about the game since its reveal in the way of updates, but the publisher has broken its silence with a new trailer confirming a release window and promising a bigger look at the title in the near future.\nThe video heavily leans into the skepticism fans have expressed over College Football’s existence, proudly expressing, “Yes, the game is real” while showing off snippets of behind-the-scenes development footage. The snazzy video doesn’t do much besides that, but it ends with a promise of a full reveal in May and a summer launch window. \n\n\nEA Sports College Football 25 is being developed by EA Orlando (formerly known as Tiburon), the team behind the Madden games. This will be the first college football game from the publisher since the demise of its NCAA Football series, the last entry of which was released in 2013. The franchise was shelved due to a 2014 federal lawsuit in which the judge ruled that the NCAA’s long-standing rule prohibiting college athletes from being compensated for their in-game likenesses was unlawful. \nWith Name, Image, Likeness (NIL) rules now in place in college sports, players can now be paid for appearing in advertisements or products. That would, of course, include video games. EA Sports struck a deal with OneTeam Partners to broker deals with players to include their NIL in the upcoming game. However, this was met with resistance from school/player licensing agency The Brandr Group last summer, which filed a lawsuit to prevent EA from conducting such deals with OneTeam Partners. Both entities eventually agreed to a settlement in November, dropping the lawsuit (thanks College Football HQ). \nWe don’t know what platforms EA Sports College Football 25 will target, but that answer should hopefully come in May’s larger update.",

Its guardian, Stella, grants Peach the ability to transform and gain powers based on the costumes she dons. Stages take the form of different theater plays with ever-changing sets. \nThe video introduces Figure Skater Peach, which sees her gracefully skating across a winter-themed stage and performing spins to take out enemies. The Dashing Thief costume gives Peach a Carmen Sandiego-esque look and vibe as she uses a retractable grappling hook to zipline and swing across 2D levels while evading security bots. Mermaid Peach grants a siren-like singing voice used in what appears to be a type of musical mini-game. Mighty Peach basically turns the Princess into a Super Sentai-like hero battling aliens using super strength and a jetpack to take out foes mid-air.\n\n\nPrincess Peach: Showtime is coming to Switch on March 22. Nintendo is also launching pink rose-colored Joy-Cons for the occasion.",

We need as many people as possible to test this beta version of the 14.X release series, so you can find and we can squash as many bugs as possible before the actual release. To guide you a bit towards what you should be looking for: Generic gameplay bugs and crashes. There is a new Ship Pathfinder; test it out. Buoys are optional to use. You can now automatically unbunch your vehicles at a depot. We added our own interpretation of daylength to the game. More on this soon in another blog post. There are many GUI improvements throughout the game. More consistent look, better GUI scaling. There are many more things worth talking about, and this will be made more clear when we approach the release of 14.0. But for now, play the game, and please report any issues you find. The usual titlegame competition has also been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker",

When you're done using the device, Google wipes all your data and factory resets the device before making it available to another developer.\nDuring Open Alpha, you can use Device Streaming at no cost. To get started simply sign into your Developer account from Android Studio and select a Firebase project. If you don't already have a Firebase project, it's easy to create one.
