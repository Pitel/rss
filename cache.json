Either they wake up in a world where all their classmates are beautiful anime girls who want to jump their bones, or they find themselves in a twisted supernatural murder mystery. Unfortunately for Takumi Nishijou, the protagonist of Chaos;Head Noah, he’s stuck in the latter. What plays out is a very good, if narratively inconsistent, story that is gripping and disturbing in equal measures.\nDespite being the first game in the Science Adventure series which includes the excellent Steins;Gate, this is the first time that Chaos;Head Noah has had an official English release. Spike Chunsoft has done the localisation work to bring this game and its indirect sequel Chaos;Child to the rest of the world. Chaos;Head Noah is a remaster of the original, which includes HD upgraded visuals that look sharp and crisp either in docked or handheld mode. They fare slightly better in handheld, with the Switch proving once again to be the perfect console for visual novels. Both games are available individually on eShop or bundled together in one text-heavy physical Double Pack.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

All signs pointed to it being a flop: its development had been plagued by bankruptcy and downsizing; it came out on a last-generation console just after the release of the Nintendo 64; and worst of all, it was a game about... farming. This was an era where kids wanted to fly spaceships and save princesses, not till soil and pull weeds.\nBut something about Bokujō Monogatari captured the imagination of Japan's gamers, and although its sales weren't stellar — just 20,000 sales at launch — it was popular enough to make it over to North America a year later, and Europe six months after that, rebranded as \"Harvest Moon\".\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "You're powered up, get in there!\nThe recent release of Splatoon 3 spawned an interesting discussion over what justifies a sequel. Considering that Splatoon 2 is still playable on the Switch and maintains a healthy player base, its follow-up was viewed by some as an unnecessary iteration that failed to meaningfully innovate. Blizzard’s recent release of Overwatch 2 reminds us quite a bit of that situation; what we have here is a sequel that made some subtle tweaks to the gameplay without really changing or adding anything (beyond a notable switch to free-to-play here), only in this case you can’t go back and play the predecessor if you preferred it. Overwatch 2 manages to provide an enjoyable competitive FPS experience that can be a real thrill to engage in, but it’s also chock full of reminders of how much it missed the mark.\nThough Overwatch 2 certainly could be classified as an FPS, its heavy focus on teamwork and maximizing the utility of each character’s abilities imbues the gameplay with plenty of MOBA elements. Characters are sorted into either the healer, tank, or DPS roles, but even those of the same type often play radically differently.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

But the developer has now hinted that the next update will introduce a beloved, wholesome mechanic — at least, we assume.\nIn a recent Twitter poll on the official Disney Dreamlight Valley account, the developer asked a very simple question with a very simple answer: \"Would you like to be able to interact with your animal companions?\" We personally think it's a one-answer question, and so does Gameloft apparently! But the poll has multiple options, all variations on \"Yes\" (what else would it be?).

With the RTX 4090 and a whole family of oversized GPUs on the way, those tiny PCIe slots on your motherboard are taking on an incredible amount of weight, such that even mid-range cards can sag and bend over time. \nThe best way to prevent this is with a brace, which pushes up from the bottom of your case to the far end of the graphics card, holding it level and preventing all that force from affecting the card or the PCIe slot. You sometimes get a support brace like this free with your graphics card, but otherwise you can pick one up fairly inexpensively from a range of manufacturers. \nRead more",

          "description": "I keep forgetting Valkyrie Elysium's PC release date is later than its console one. The action platformer came out on PlayStation late last week, but it's not coming to Steam until November 11th. So far, reviews have been quite middling, which isn't wholly surprising in some sense, but having played the public demo the other week, I'm not ashamed to say that I had a pretty all right time with it! Based on two hours of play time, I'd say it's very much in the same kind of vein as your Bayonettas and Nier: Automatas, and I'm 100% down for that.\nRead more",

And all things considered, I do not miss it in the slightest. I spent so much time straining against the game's tug-of-war matches that I simply grew tired of trying really hard at it - or perhaps more accurately, trying not to launch my head through the nearest plaster wall.\nClearly, there was a time where I adored Overwatch, though. A time when I'd grind solo-queue most evenings until 3am, in a bid to climb the ranks ever higher. To what end? My own personal satisfaction, I suppose. I'd eventually hit Master (let me brag just once, okay) and then a few months later, I applied for a job at Gamer Network writing guides about Overwatch's intricacies. I moved to Brighton for my first proper job. Now, with Overwatch 2's release, it all feels like it's come full circle.\nRead more",

And while it certainly captures the same kind of atmosphere as Returnal, I'm sorry to say that's about as far as the comparison goes, as the rest of Scars Above is a much slower, more traditional kind of space action game. \nRead more",

          "description": "Over at Eurogamer, I kind of have a thing for LG's Fast IPS screens. This tech combines the best feature of TN panels - their incredibly fast pixel response times - with the traditional advantages of an IPS screen, namely gorgeous colours and wide viewing angles. These screens pop up in LG's 27GL850 and 27GL83A monitors, but are also used in Dell's even better S2721DGFA - and it's this monitor that's on sale today. With a code available here, you can take an extra £30 off a model that's already seen an £80 discount, dropping the price from £380 to £268 - an incredible deal for a monitor of this specification. I used the code $6ZZXZWLF0WV7D, but your code is likely to be different!\nSo what is this specification? Well, the S2721DGFA exists right at the sweet spot for gaming monitors too, with a 27-inch screen size, 2560x1440 resolution and 165Hz refresh rate. This spec is good because it's not too hard to drive, even with a mid-range gaming PC, but you still get a noticeable increase in clarity and fluidity compared to your standard 1080p 60Hz monitors. And with the Fast IPS screen that I was talking about earlier, you have a monitor that's equally well-suited to fast-paced, competitive shooters as it is slower-paced and more atmospheric games from a wide range of genres.\r\n\nI have gone on about the Dell S2721DGFA a few times now, so I'll link to those previous posts so you can find out a little bit more about this monitor - and see how much it used to cost too! Suffice it to say, if you have a look at some reviews you'll see that I'm far from the only fan of this model, so I hope this deal is useful to you! Thanks for joining me once again and I'll see you tomorrow for more deals. \n Read more",

          "description": "Moonbreaker is an early access turn-based tabletop game by the Subnautica devs, and before you ask, no there isn't a Blue Eyes White Basking Shark piece that inhales everything on the board. There are, however, plenty of sci-fi people who wield spears and guns and do battle by spending a currency called Cinder, if that's your jam.\nWhether you're new to tabletop strategy or already like bashing miniatures together, the game makes for a perfectly enjoyable time. I just don't know whether it goes beyond \"perfectly enjoyable\" into \"thrilling\", though, and that may be down to its lack of, well, lots of things. Give it time and it may just evolve into a game of serious depth but right now it's a bit too miniature to recommend wholeheartedly.\nRead more",

          "description": "Somewhere at the edges of the galaxy in No Man's Sky lies a large, verdant planet with an abandoned, but functioning, starter ship on it. I left it there in 2016 after discovering a larger ship out in the wilds, but it's a decision that still haunts me to this very day. You see, I was so taken with my new set of wings that I failed to notice it didn't have a functioning hyperdrive attached, which is needed to punch through the atmosphere to visit another solar system. It also turned out that this particular planet didn't have any of the necessary resources to craft a new one either, leaving my only form of escape back in my tiny little starter ship – which, of course, was now nowhere to be seen. I spent hours looking for that little ship, but the planet was so vast that I never saw it again. \nUpcoming aerial survival game Forever Skies doesn't have lots of large planets to lose your only means of transportation in, thankfully. In its Steam Next Fest demo at least, the only things I was able to land my makeshift aircraft on were tiny, rusty platforms perched atop decaying skyscrapers on an Earth ruined by disease and an ecological apocalypse. But that fear of getting stranded somewhere I shouldn't be has never left me, and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't just a teensy bit scared of jumping down from my ship and finding I wasn't able to get back up to it again. \nRead more",

Both display a vast chaotic ballet, in which two teams composed of some of the most well-realised characters in hero shooters wage war until one team emerges triumphant. Just like its predecessor, Overwatch 2 is one of the most delicately crafted sensory onslaughts I've experienced in a game.\nGuiding my old favourite heroes through venerable maps like King's Row and Route 66, it's like I never left. In many ways, it feels like I've simply been given a reason to play Overwatch 1 again. Is that enough for a sequel? Is it enough to justify the incredibly confusing, lengthy, and oft-botched process of trying to make Overwatch feel relevant again? I'm not certain it is. But perhaps it should be.\nRead more",

Finally, another game befitting A44, the studio behind minimalistic Ashen which Brendy quite enjoyed.\nColour me excited when I had the chance to see a half-hour presentation of the game in action at this year's Gamescom, and chat to A44's CEO Derek Holding at the same time. It was even better than I'd expected, honestly, and I've come away with the belief that it may just be one of the best Soulslikes to arrive in quite some time.\nRead more",

          "description": "Petrol stations might not be the most natural setting for pondering life's biggest questions, but the ones in Flat Eye, the next game from the makers of detective taxi-me-do Night Call, aren't your ordinary rest stops. As well as a convenient place to relieve yourself and top up on snacks, these futuristic service stations also house cosmetic surgery bots, operation tables, teleportation booths and more - and they're all overseen by a powerful AI trying to find the best possible future for the human race. As the station's head clerk, you'll debate the ethics of eternal youth and end of life care, while also making sure your station has enough power, stocked shelves and a happy customer base. It's certainly an intriguing combo compared to other management games out there right now, so I sat down with director Laurent Victorino and writer Antony Jauneaud to find out more.\nRead more",

Beatrix LeBeau has packed up her slime-wrangling gear and has crossed the Slime Sear to Rainbow Island, a new land packed with new mysteries and new slimes.\nAs a seasoned slime wrangler myself, I was excited to dive head-first into this new, colourful world. Review code didn't arrive until launch day unfortunately, but all week I've been vibrating with anticipation. After spending a handful of hours frolicking with slimes and skipping around Rainbow Island, though, that early dazzle is starting to wear off. Monomi Park’s sequel feels a little too familiar to its predecessor in its early game, and it's put a major downer on my goo-hoovering adventures.\nRead more",

          "description": "Out Of Hands is a fairly \"does what it says on the tin\" title for this, a game where you play a dude who dreams he is made entirely out of hands every night. It also operates as a decent joke, because rather than being out of hands, he, if anything, has too many. So full marks for the name. The game itself is kind of a deckbuilder but not really, and though it also describes itself as a thriller, I can't say my heart rate was raised. In fact, behind the (admittedly very cool) visual style there seems to be a pretty run-of-the-mill \"a girl I liked is no longer in my life and I'm pretty cut up about that\" story. I guess in the full game it might turn out she was murdered, or she mudered the main character, or the main character murdered her - just, some kind of murder, maybe?\nBut in the four demo levels I played recently, it seemed like a pretty normal breakup. I was really excited to give it a go, but in the preview I didn't find the contrast between a face made of squirming hands and the well trodden women-be-leavin' plot to be particularly affective or evocative. The squirming hands are cool, though.\nRead more",

          "description": "At this year's Gamescom I got hands-on with Bytten Studio's Cassette Beasts, an upcoming monster-taming open world RPG in the vein of Pokémon, which is far more interesting to me than the basic concept of Pokémon. That's because you're able to fuse together any monsters you 'catch', but moreso because it's a monster collectathon where you become the monster, essentially fusing yourself with bomb dogs and hermit crabs with traffic cone-homes.\nI like the way the game does away with the overdone shonen story of wanting to become the very best there ever was, and instead puts the spotlight on its cast of characters and the relationships you form with your buds. It's looking mighty promising.\nRead more",

          "description": "If you've ever wondered what the 1987 film Running Man might look like as a turn-based tactics game (see also last year's Netflix sensation Squid Game, if the Running Man reference doesn't quite do it for you), then Homicidal All-Stars probably comes pretty close. It's the debut game from Artificer, a new studio formed by a bunch of ex-CreativeForge devs who worked on the first Hard West and Phantom Doctrine, and it centres on a woman called Scarlett who finds herself competing in the deadly TV show that gives the game its name. Like Running Man, Squid Game and all those other 'deadly games' you know and love, Homicidal All-Stars is about folks who down on their luck fighting for their lives, where their only consolation prize in these dystopian bloodbaths is not getting pulped at the end of it. \nFor Scarlett, this means mowing down scumbags in classic turn-based fashion with a bunch of other friendly competitors she's teamed up with, but this is far from a straightforward XCOM-like. Between fights, you'll also be navigating its trap-filled arenas in third-person, dodging sniper turrets, disabling tripwires, and dashing over spiky/fiery/horrible pits to get to the end of each 'episode'. It's a refreshing mix based on an early preview build I've been playing recently, especially when its gameshow hook allows for its malicious host, Orion Ford, to start meddling with your success. \"He’s the person behind the worst of the twists,\" creative director and Artificer CEO Kacper Szymczak tells me. \"He’ll start filling the level with poisonous gas, he’ll turn off the lights, drop explosive barrels everywhere, to name just a few.\"\nRead more",

Jiná jsou duplicitní, další si protiřečí. A o tom, jak jsou na tom tyto systémy s uživatelským komfortem, a do kolika z nich může veřejnost alespoň trošku nahlédnout, o tom snad ani není třeba mluvit. Hackathon už několik ročníků ukazuje, jaké přínosy a výhody může mít pro stát i občany to, když stát otevře a zpřístupní svá data. Jak se tato data dají využít k novým poznatkům, k tvorbě aplikací a systémů, ke zkvalitnění prostředí, ve kterém vy, daňoví poplatníci, žijete\".",

The sequel has been one of the most anticipated games of recent memory, and it's looking pretty good based on the most recent story trailer we got during a State of Play.\nNow the studio has announced that God of War: Ragnarok has gone gold, meaning they have sent off the final version of the game to get ready for its release on November 9. It's a huge step for any game developer, and it's even more impressive for a game as ambitious as we know this one to be. Here's hoping they have at least a bit of time to celebrate before continuing work on patches and bug fixes.\nhttps://twitter.com/SonySantaMonica/status/1578415056215330817\n \nRagnarok is set three years after the events of its predecessor, and picks up at the end of Fimbulwinter giving way to the apocalyptic Ragnorak. Kratos and his son Arteus are trying to find a way to prevent the event from happening, all while wrapping them up in the family drama of the Norse gods. The game looks gorgeous, and it promises to deliver on some exciting new gameplay mechanics. Plus, it's fun to get a new take on the Norse pantheon after the MCU version has reigned supreme for so long.\nPlayers have lots to look forward to gameplay wise, as Kratos is getting a revamped battle axe and access to his classic chains weapons. There're also gonna be some new elemental attacks, specifically fire and ice charged attacks, and shields and parries will also play a role. Basically, get ready for all the hack-and-slash, axe-throwing goodness we know and love, but also with some upgrades.\nI know I'm looking forward to Ragnarok, and with only a few short weeks to wait, I'll be here before we know it.\nThe post God of War Ragnarok has gone gold appeared first on Destructoid.",

Considering it started as something of a rip-off of Ninja-Kun after Jaleco published the Famicom port of that game. It never really had a strong identity, but Jaleco was going to throw it against the wall as many times as it could until it finally stuck.\nIt never stuck. Reinvention didn’t work. The biggest offshoot was Ninja Jajamaru-Kun's attempts at JRPGs, but 1991’s Ninja Jajamaru Ginga Daisakusen for Famicom is perhaps the one that feels most desperate.

          "description": "And it's insanely gorgeous\nEvery once in a while, I see something a player has created on Reddit or Twitter, and it makes me have faith in video games again. I've been feeling a bit run down after the tumultuous Overwatch 2 launch this week, but then I saw something so beautiful, it made me remember what a beautiful medium games can be: a Minecraft player recreated the entire universe in the game. Yeah, it's just as beautiful as it sounds.\nUser u/ChrisDaCow uploaded a video of his work to the Minecraft subreddit, among other sites, earlier this week, and the post has amassed more awards than I've ever seen on Reddit before. The build features a black hole, a nebula, the whole solar system, and a super cluster.\nChrisDaCow also made a whole vlog documenting to process of the build, which I find fascinating as someone who hasn't played more than a handful of hours in Minecraft. He says one of the most useful tools that made the entire build possible is the fact that you can \"paint with light\" in the game (something I never knew was a thing), which allowed him to recreate how light actually works in space.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAkb2mpybnM\nHe also had to scale the blocks way down to fit everything into one Minecraft world, and Chris even breaks out some math to make sure to get the scale of Saturn's rings just right. I'm seriously impressed by how much effort he put into this whole thing, and I get the feeling it's going to go down as one of the all time greatest Minecraft builds of all time.\nNot gonna lie, I usually have a good deal of existential dread rattling around, but seeing our universe depicted so beautifully and with so much care helps me see things in a new light.\nThe post This player recreated the entire universe in Minecraft appeared first on Destructoid.",

A new report indicates that was a mistake, however.\nAccording to Eurogamer, the trailer listing both PlayStation platforms is \"a mistake,\" as the outlet understands. The original listing for PS4 obviously stirred up some rampant speculation that this might turn out to be a PS4 game as well.\nWhile this trailer is still online as of this writing, it no longer lists PS4 in the title as it previously did. Looks like Dead Space is still aiming for just the newer generation.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWrBqrifdvk\nBack out to space\nThe Dead Space remake is being handled by Electronic Arts' Motive studio, which previously worked on games like Star Wars Battlefront II and Star Wars Squadrons.\nFor Dead Space, the team has been surprisingly candid about the development process. Motive has shown several deep, behind-the-scenes looks at the making of this remake, spotlighting sound, art, and more.\nWe also got a look at some gameplay just this week, along with the reveal of a really neat (and really expensive) collector's edition from Limited Run Games.\nIt's been quite a few years since players first set foot on the USG Ishimura. But honestly, I'm more than ready for a Dead Space revival. I'm not even one for horror games most of the time, but I loved the sci-fi terror of the Dead Space series.\nWe'll see how Motive's own venture onto the Ishimura goes when Dead Space launches January 27, 2023 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.\nThe post Dead Space remake trailer with PS4 listing was a mistake appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Shield your savings account\nThose of you who were big into the merchandising angle of Blizzard Entertainment's Overwatch will likely remember, (or perhaps even own) some of the excellent statues that were released, depicting heroes such as Tracer, Widowmaker, Mercy, and Dva in fine form at a relatively reasonable price — Well, the statues are seemingly returned, although the \"relatively reasonable price\" part may not be.\nFollowing this week's launch of flashy sequel Overwatch 2, Blizzard has opened pre-orders on a brand new statue of perhaps OW's noblest and most steel-hearted of heroes, the mighty Reinhardt. This very impressive centerpiece is sculpted of PVC and polyresin and stands a huge 25 inches in height, showcasing the shining knight one step away from launching his devastating ult: Earthshatter.\n\nThis hand-painted specimen features exquisite detail, perfectly recreating Reinhardt's battle armor and expertly capturing the hero in an extremely dynamic pose. While all of the Overwatch statues have been impressive, Reinhardt's intricate design, strong posture, and base detail seem to be setting the tone for a new wave of statues, ones that will see the heroes \"mid-match\" rather than standing at rest.\nOf course, all of this size and detail comes at a price, and Reinhardt is a doozy. Now available to pre-order over at the official Blizzard Gear store, Reinhardt will set you back $1,100 USD (not including shipping or any potential customs costs). There does not appear to be any sort of installment plan ala most statue sellers, so you may have to drop the four figures in one lump sum come launch day. Reinhardt is tentatively expected to release in November... You still have a couple of weeks to save up..?\nOverwatch 2 is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Overwatch 2 Reinhardt statue to bring the hammer down on your wallet appeared first on Destructoid.",

Once again, the funky fresh aliens have crash-landed on Planet Earth, and must recover all of the pieces of their \"Rapmaster Rocket\" in order to get back out into the great beyond.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQlK-jTIiwU\nNow sporting a roster of both new and familiar playable characters, as well as four-player co-op action, the series' dopey sense of humor, and the tongue-in-cheek \"radical\" vibes of the 1990s, all slickly adapted for the modern age. A suitably fresh soundtrack was composed by funk musician Cody Wright, while the entire project was overseen by Toe Jam & Earl co-creator Greg Johnson and, believe it or not, lifelong fan Macaulay Culkin.\nOn release, Back in the Groove was welcomed by the TJ&E fanbase, while critical reviews ranged wildly from mediocre to excellent. As divisive as the duo has ever been, Back in the Groove is clearly a title that will mean different things to different players. At least, given its upcoming freebie status, you'll be able to check out where you stand on the animated actioner — no strings attached, dude.\nToe Jam & Earl: Back in the Groove will be free to download from Epic Games Store from October 13.

It was incredible to play the game in a pre-launch bubble where it didn't really impact me that much: only to see the game actually come out, and witness the subject be debated on high for months on end. But as Reddit user Vados_Link shows us, people ended up discovering unique ways to approach the game's many deliberate, or accidental puzzles.\nCleverly, they use Magnesis to pick up an already-used treasure chest, and utilize the enemy's lack of line of sight to set up their plan. Then they flick the chest into a giant group of formidable enemies, line up their shot, and shock it multiple times with a Shock Arrow. One of the best parts of the clip is how they all thunk into the ground in a satisfying way.\nWhile we really don't have any details on Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's approach to durability, they have to have taken some lessoned learned from Breath of the Wild at least. While there are plenty of ways around it (and it didn't really impact me much on any of my playthroughs, including the first, which was completely blind), it's a polarizing topic that has a few different solutions.\nOne of the best uses of Shock Arrows in Breath of the Wild:\n\n \nThe post As we wait for Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, there are still fun things to discover in Breath of the Wild appeared first on Destructoid.",

The \"Waypoint\" update overhauls some fundamental pieces of the No Man's Sky experience, from inventory and UI to game modes.\nOne big part of the update is custom game modes. Players can essentially tailor the gameplay of No Man's Sky to their liking through different presets and options. Tick survival elements all the way down if you don't want to deal with toxic hazards, or combat way up if you want a bit of a challenge. Even elements like fuel usage can be set to \"free\", letting you zip around the stars with no gas fees attached.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWgZ2kjL4bM\nThis adds to the roster of already existing modes, like Normal, Creative, and the Community Expeditions. Another new mode setting, Relaxed, is also being added. It's described as an accessible, laid-back experience for players who want to check out No Man's Sky with less danger and grinding involved. Sounds like a good time, to be honest.\nSky's the limit\nOf course, there is even more in this No Man's Sky update. Seamless Auto-Saves are a big one, letting players not worry too much about making manual save points.\nAMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 2 is getting integrated too, so all PC players can get a boost in performance regardless of what card they're using.\nSpecial rockets can now deliver goods up and into space for sale, and Drop Pods have more in-game data made apparent. The inventory itself is also seeing a major overhaul, with new icons and better clarification for managing all those goods.\nSprinkle in some touches like new planetary effects and making the anomalies a little more eerie.

We just got The Pitt when it comes to the latter approach, and now another seasonal event is coming back in the rotation: Invaders from Beyond.\nThe gist is that literal aliens have come to West Virginia for research purposes, and it's your job to take various quests/partake in public events to take them down, in a wave-based format. It's a fun arcadey little diversion that goes along with the cheeky alien references in various prior Fallout games.\nBethesda has hosted this event before, including earlier this year (twice), which features \"all-new Public Events and even random encounters (of a third kind) as you fend off the alien threat with your teammates.\"\nAlso remember, Fallout 76 is free to try this week\nA lot is currently going on in the Fallout-verse, too.\nDue to the 25th anniversary celebration event, Fallout 76 is currently free to try. While the first day kicked off on October 4 you still have some time left, as it runs through October 11. The game is also currently still free on Prime Gaming through November 1.\nThe post Invaders from Beyond returns to Fallout 76 for a limited time appeared first on Destructoid.",

The new title will be added to the Switch Online archives on Thursday, October 13.\nReleased on N64 in 1996, Pilotwings 64 is a revamped edition of the much-loved 1990 SNES classic, best known for its groundbreaking use of Mode 7 technology, which was very much a boasting point for Nintendo during the 16-bit era. Much like the original, Pilotwings 64 features an array of airborne stunts and acrobatic activities, including skydiving, Cannonball, stunt gliding, or even taking to the wild blue yonder equipped with a jet pack or seated in a gyrocopter!\nMy dad started building a gyrocopter a decade ago. I think he sold it before completion. True story.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmepP3ehkaM\nAnyway, Pilotwings 64 will be made available to all Nintendo Switch Online subscribers, and joins a roster of beloved hits from yesteryear that already includes Kirby 64, Pokemon Snap, Mario Golf, F-Zero X, Star Fox 64, Banjo-Kazooie, and, of course, Super Mario 64. Most recently, Nintendo finally confirmed that GoldenEye 007, one of the N64's most iconic releases and conspicuous by its continued absence, is headed to the archives in the near future, complete with online multiplayer.\nPilotwings 64 will be available to download from Nintendo Switch Online on October 13.\nThe post Pilotwings 64 touches down on Nintendo Switch Online October 13 appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's still 1000 Platinum Points.]\n[Update #2: Nintendo has once again restocked the Metroid Dread poster as of the evening of November 10, 2021.]\n[Update: The My Nintendo Metroid Dread poster just got a restock on October 19, 2021! This thing has been going for $50 or more on eBay as a set (or $25 individually), so maybe consider getting in on it.]\nWelcome back to the '90s, where everything is holographic! Nintendo is celebrating the launch of Metroid Dread with a new My Nintendo reward, which has become the new norm for first-party games. Given how popular they are on the shop, it's no surprise that it's a Metroid Dread poster set.\nAs a two-pack for a whopping 1000 Platinum Points (plus shipping), you can get two holographic foil Metroid Dread poster rewards. Both feature art from the game, including Samus squaring off against two of the main enemies from the game: the mysterious Chozo remnants and the E.M.M.I. robots. The posters are sized at 11.75\" x 18\", and Nintendo also has a few digital wallpapers on the same reward site.\nAs a reminder, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward, like the Metroid Dread poster two-pack here. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time.\nJust know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.\n\nThe post Now that Metroid Dread is out, it has a My Nintendo poster reward (Update) appeared first on Destructoid.",

Kojima Productions as QR codes posted at PAX Australia were found to link to a new, uncensored version of the same headshot, with some variants replacing the phrase \"Who Am I?\" with a new question: \"Where Am I?\"\n\nFanning will join a list of notable Tinseltown actors who have worked with Kojima Productions on its releases. Most notably, 2019's Death Stranding, which featured appearances from Norman Reedus, Mads Mikkelson, Lea Seydoux, Margaret Qualley, and Lindsey Wagner, among others. There was also a role for film director Nicholas Winding Refn, who coincidentally directed Fanning in the aforementioned psych-horror film, The Neon Demon.\nIt is very likely that we will hear more about Kojima Productions' new project and the involvement of Elle Fanning at The Game Awards, which is scheduled to take place December 8 at the Microsoft Arena in Los Angeles. I wouldn't start the hype engines just yet, however. Given that this is yer boy Hideo that we're talking about, there is likely to be something of a long haul ahead before the new title is even likely to be viewed in a playable state.\nThe post Elle Fanning revealed as star of Kojima Productions’ mystery project appeared first on Destructoid.",

The game was always more than just the multiplayer experience — it was the comics and the animated shorts and the seasonal story events, too.

If you need recommendations, they never steer you wrong with their pre-made bundles, they prop up small indie creators who likely wouldn't get a platform otherwise, and a lot of times they raise a ton of money for worthy causes with their charity bundles. This October, they're shining a light on one of the best games of last year: Deathloop, Arkane's time-looping first-person shooter mystery roguelite.\nThat's some serious video game word salad, but trust me when I say it delivers on all of those fronts. Deathloop is a slick, stylish game with a unique premise and some of the best game voice acting performances of late, and personally I feel like it deserved even more hype than it already got.\nA lot of people may not know that you can even become a monthly subscriber to Humble Bundle Choice for $12 a month, which gives you a whole slew of free games every month that you get to keep after you've cancelled your subscription. Members also have access to a rotating library of games you can play, as well as discount codes. It's another gaming subscription service, but overall it's a good deal if you like the kinds of games that they have.\n\nEnter Deathloop, one of the free games on offer this month, along with seven other titles:\nThe Dark Pictures Anthology: Little Hope\nDisciples: Liberation\nEpic Chef\nGolf Gang\nMaid of Sker\nMonster Train First Class (Collector's Edition)\nRailroad Corporation\nIf you've yet to play Deathloop, this is a great opportunity to give it a try.

          "description": "Turns out I'm 100% a gamer\nLizzo has been one of the most prolific pop artists of the last few years, releasing bop after endlessly catchy bop. She made news recently by elegantly playing the former president James Madison's crystal flute in the Library of Congress, reminding us that she's not just a great performer, but also a highly trained musician. Lizzo has brought fresh, bright sounds to pop that have been missing for a while, and she's also done a lot to give back after all of her success. If you can't tell, I'm a big fan of hers, so it's cool to see her influence cross over into the games space. Considering Lizzo's contributions to modern pop music, it was only a matter of time that she was immortalized by one of the highest honors in the land -- her own Beat Saber DLC pack.\nAs something of a Beat Saber aficionado myself, I can say with confidence that Lizzo's upbeat, bubbly, and groovy pop songs are nothing short of perfect for the VR rhythm game. The pack will also a include special environment that is themed after Lizzo's newest album, Special, featuring purple and yellow blocks, a rainbow, and Lizzo's name spelled out in lights.\n\nThe pack's full track list includes:\n\"Be Loved (Am I Ready)\"\n\"About Damn Time\"\n\"Cuz I Love You\"\n\"Everybody's Gay\"\n\"Good as Hell\"\n\"Juice\"\n\"Tempo (ft. Missy Elliot)\"\n\"Truth Hurts\"\n\"Worship\"\nThe new song pack is out today, and goes for $11.99, or $1.99 per individual song. It's been a minute since I've played because of how annoying it is to redownload my Beat Saber mods every time the game updates, but considering this is an officially released song pack that won't give me that same issue, it might be time for me to dust off the Oculus after a few months away.\nThe post Beat Saber’s newest DLC pack features Lizzo’s most iconic songs appeared first on Destructoid.",

Movie, from Nintendo and Illumination.\nShown off during a special Nintendo Direct today, we got a little bit of info from Shigeru Miyamoto and Illumination's Chris Meledandri on the putting-together of this collaboration.\nThen, we got to see the trailer. We see an intro scene of Bowser and Kamek arriving to overthrow a penguin kingdom, eventually grabbing a star in the process. Then, we pan over to see Chris Pratt's Mario, hearing his take on the iconic plumber for the first time alongside a big look at the Mushroom Kingdom.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPpazvJrHm0\nMario goes to the movies\nReports of Nintendo and Illumination's team-up first started in 2017. In the time since, we've had a few crumbs here and there, including a full voice cast reveal last year. Alongside Pratt's role as Mario, several celebrities are set to lend their talents, ranging from Charlie Day as Luigi to Keegan-Michael Key as Toad. Both of those got a little spotlight in today's trailer too, though the main show was Mario and Bowser.\nThe video game-movie adaptation pipeline has certainly grown over the last few years. Sonic the Hedgehog has had two major motion pictures and more is on the way, leading the way for many more. PlayStation has been kicking up its own productions, with an Uncharted movie already out and The Last of Us headed to HBO.\nThis obviously isn't Mario's first silver screen appearance, but it's a pretty big one. I will say, Jack Black's Bowser works pretty well for me. As for some of the others, I'm going to need to hear more (I was a little bummed we didn't hear more of Day as Luigi, or see Princess Peach at all).\nThe Super Mario Bros.

The page went live today, with reservations open for anyone who wants to pick up a new resting spot for Steam Deck.\nThe official Valve Steam Deck Dock goes for $89. As of the time of this writing, it lists an estimated delivery date of one to two weeks, though that could shift.\nThis USB-C Dock acts as an extension, essentially, for a Steam Deck. It's got HDMI 2.0 and DisplayPort 1.4 connections for external displays, alongside three USB-A 3.1 Gen1 ports and a Gigabit Ethernet port.\nLinking the Deck to the Deck is a USB-C captive cable with a special low-profile, right-angle connector so it slots in right on top. This also acts as a power delivery source.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvokyBOYe8Y\nSteam power\nIn an FAQ question on the order page, Valve confirms the Steam Deck Dock comes with both the Docking Station and a power supply cable, the same one as the one that came with the Deck.\nWhile Valve says it's tested on a wide range of displays and peripherals, it also asks users to note in the Steam forums if their setup is not compatible.\nImportantly, the Docking Station will not increase the performance of the Steam Deck. The Dock just allows for charging and connectivity. The Dock can also be used without a power supply, though Valve notes the USB ports will have reduced throughput to conserve power in this configuration.\nFor those who haven't got a Steam Deck yet, it also seems like orders are continuing to speed up. Users were reporting short delivery times earlier today, though that's been shifting and will shift depending on demand. Valve has stated that it's moving through reservations faster than expected, so this might be a decent time to try nabbing a Steam Deck for the holidays.\nThe post Valve’s official Steam Deck Dock is up for orders appeared first on Destructoid.",

Solidifying this bond gives us the opportunity to up our game — to plan even more ambitiously and bring Limbic Entertainment to the next level.\"\nBandai Namco previously purchased a minority stake in Limbic back in February 2021, as the studio began its work on the aforementioned new-gen park builder, Park Beyond, to be published by Bandai Namco once development is complete.

          "description": "The mode won't have any buy-in anymore\nUnknown Worlds' Moonbreaker recently dropped into Early Access, allowing players to buy in and test it out. And in response to that feedback, the studio is already removing one element: the Cargo Run's Contracts.\nCargo Run is a game mode in Moonbreaker where players can carry over, battle-to-battle, in order to build up a streak and win rewards. Playing through rounds, you still play typical Moonbreaker. Fight another team with your squad, defeat the Captain, and move on. If you fail, you drop the Cargo Run.\nPlaying these Cargo Runs initially cost a Contract. It's not too dissimilar from how Hearthstone handles its Arena draft mode. Along the way, you can pick up cargo during matches for power boosts to your chosen squad, and get Blanks, a type of currency in Moonbreaker.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA_ApUlmD6A\nDropping some cargo\nPlayers, however, didn't seem to like this set-up. Moonbreaker costs money to buy into already, and having an additional fee on top to play the Cargo Run mode didn't seem to sit right.\nIn a post titled the \"Cargo Run Update\", the Moonbreaker team confirms it's removing Contracts from the game entirely.\n\"While our intent was always for players to be able to earn enough Blanks during Cargo Run to continually unlock additional Contracts to play, we understand the community’s collective frustration that this mode felt gated and the desire to have any possible limitation removed,\" the blog reads.\nAny players who purchased Contracts using Pulsars or Blanks before this change will get the full amount of relevant currency refunded. Any Contracts still in your player inventory will be converted to Blanks. And as the game is being adjusted for unlimited Cargo Run play, Blanks will not be on the reward table for the mode any more. Season Track XP will still be earnable, though.\nThe post Moonbreaker is removing Cargo Run Contracts from the game appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Oh! Well DLC bundle will launch on all platforms October 13.\nThe new DLC includes five all-new Eternal Well stages to conquer, each sporting creepy variants on its villains and a Burton-esque color scheme, adding to the supernatural vibe. As Kao punches his way through each stage, he will also unlock a selection of five freaky skins, which will be perfect for October 31, when yer bouncy boy goes trick or treating. You can check out the new content in the trailer below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp2YhX-23nQ\nThe Kao the Kangaroo sequel launched last summer, following a successful player campaign to bring the marvelous marsupial back to the world of mascot platformers. While the new title will be unashamedly over-familiar for fans of another 3D platform hero, Kao the Kangaroo is a fun, attractive, and charming adventure — definitely worth checking out for genre fans. In fact, from October 13, players can pick up the original game, all previous DLC, and the new Halloween bundle for a special $34.99 bundle price.\nKao the Kangaroo is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch — The Oh!

NFS Unbound will follow the escapades of a die-hard, passionate gang of street racers, as they battle their way through the neon streets of the city, the ever-present wail of police sirens floating listlessly in the night skies.\nAs is to be expected, NFS Unbound will feature state-of-the-art visuals and game mechanics, and will also place a heavy emphasis on player customization, allowing the community to modify and decorate their ride so it will spin as many heads as it will wheels — in keeping with the new game flashy fashionista aesthetic. Developed by racing genre veterans Criterion Games, it is a fairly safe bet that NFS Unbound will deliver when it finally pulls out of the garage this winter.\nNeed for Speed Unbound launches on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X on December 2.\nThe post Need for Speed Unbound hits PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X in December appeared first on Destructoid.",

Spoiler for Bayonetta 1: Cereza is the child version of Bayonetta, so perhaps our hero simply wanted to return to her adolescent roots. However, the third game's focus on the multiverse has prompted some fans to consider a more tantalizing theory. \nFirst, to provide some context, here's a (relatively) quick refresher of Bayonetta's backstory for newcomers or lapsed fans. Five hundred years prior to the events of the first game, Bayonetta, whose real name is Cereza, was born the child of an Umbra Witch and a Lumen Sage. Since the light-worshipping Sages were rivals to the da…",

It features the slick realistic visuals fans of the series know quite well but this time, it's mixed with an almost anime-like animation style. It looks great, in my opinion, but it likely won't be for everybody. \nCheck out the Need For Speed Unbound reveal trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Unbound represents a pretty drastic departure for the series in terms of visuals but elsewhere, it looks like Need For Speed. There seems to be plenty of car customization, cops to run from, city streets to speed through, and if the reveal trailer's song by A$AP Rocky is any indication, a great soundtrack.\nOnly time will tell but fortunately, we don't have to wait too long because Need For Speed Unbound hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on December 2. As you might have noticed, the reveal trailer doesn't mention consoles from the previous generation, like the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, so you might need a current-gen machine to play the game. \nAre you excited for Need For Speed Unbound?

One of the less-discussed casualties of the news was that Tequila Works’ Gylt, a horror adventure game and the first Stadia-exclusive title, would disappear entirely. Thankfully, that won’t be the case.\nTequila Works has confirmed that it plans to make Gylt multiplatform in 2023. It doesn’t specify which platforms the game will become available on, but it’s a relief to know that one of Stadia’s few original gems won’t be lost to history. \n🎃 We bring terrific news: GYLT is going multiplatform in 2023! More info to come in the upcoming months.https://t.co/ON1pbiGsB9 pic.twitter.com/2sWdseym2G\nOctober 4, 2022\nGylt launched in November 2019 alongside Stadia. It stars a young girl named Sally who searches for her missing cousin across a town haunted by evil spirits. The narrative also serves a commentary on bullying and depresssion. The game’s vibe and art direction evoke films like Coraline or Tim Burton’s animated works and channels games like Inside and Silent Hill. Gameplay emphasizes stealth, with players using a flashlight to defeat enemies. Despite its more innocent veneer, the game has its share of genuinely creepy moments, and I personally found it to be an enjoyable horror romp.\nWill you be checking out Gylt before Stadia shuts down or wait to play it elsewhere next year?

          "description": "Sony announced its new gaming loyalty program, PlayStation Stars, back in July, and the service is now live in North and South America. PlayStation users can sign up for the free program, but there’s one big caveat.\nPlayStation Stars allows players to earn points and digital collectibles by completing “campaigns,” which range from completing small objectives while playing games to larger monthly challenges. Any PlayStation player can join Stars; you don’t need a Plus subscription. \nCompleting campaigns also raises your Star Status, a leveling system consisting of four ranks. Everyone begins at Level 1, but doing things like purchasing games from PSN or earning a certain number of trophy rarities raises this level, increasing the quality of rewards you earn. \nDigital rewards, which Sony confirmed are not NFTs and cannot be resold, include models of old PlayStation consoles and characters from first-party titles. You can also redeem points to use as funds for your digital store wallet and to purchase DLC. Points remain available for 24 months after earning them. \nIf you’re running to sign up now, there’s already a waitlist to join PS Stars. Sony states that new users will have to wait about two months after the date they register to be accepted into the program. It's unclear why this is the case, but one could assume Sony doesn't want to be flooded with too many memberships at once as it gradually gets the program off the ground. Registration also doesn't seem consistent yet, as some folks were immediately let in while others have been told to wait (and some others still can't access Stars in parts of the U.S. as of publishing). \nPlayStation Stars will launch in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand next week on October 13. To learn more about the program, including its handy FAQ, you can visit its official site here.",

Likely the most crucial moment to readers of Game Informer was the debut of the Nintendo Entertainment System.\nThe NES pulled the burgeoning industry out of the “video game crash” and introduced countless iconic characters and franchises. It seemed like every hit property received a game at the time. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Top Gun, DuckTales, Dungeons & Dragons, American Gladiators: the list goes on and on. However, one iconic brand shockingly never made the transition into a NES game.\nGarbage Pail Kids, which also debuted in 1985, was a trading card series that mixed the cuteness of the hit Cabbage Patch Kid…",

This image accompanies the announcement of a Nintendo Direct happening this Thursday, October 6, all about the movie. Nintendo specifically points out that there will be no video game news, however, so don't expect anything more than Super Mario Bros. \nTune in at 1:05 p.m. PT on 10/6 for a #NintendoDirect: The Super Mario Bros.

There's Toad, an antiques stall selling relics of Mario's past video games, plenty of pipes and platforms, and of course, Princess Peach's castle high above the rest of the kingdom. There's probably plenty more to glean from the image so have at it. \nThis image is our first look at the movie, but during the Direct on Thursday, which begins at 1:05 p.m. Pacific/4:05 p.m. Eastern, Nintendo will formally introduce the movie with the first-ever world premiere trailer, so be sure to tune in. \nSuper Mario Bros. hits theaters on April 7, 2023.\nWhile waiting for this Thursday direct, read about how Nintendo is reportedly happy with the film and so happy, that additional Nintendo movies are likely on the way. Read about how Chris Pratt says his Mario voice is \"unlike anything you've heard in the Mario world\".

According to Hulst, \"further investments in areas that will strengthen the expansion on to PC, on to mobile, and into live services\" is definitely a possibility for PlayStation. \n\n\nHowever, more interesting to From Software fans perhaps is Hulst's answer when asked about Sony's investment in the studio. \n\"You should think of collaborations on the game development side first and foremost, but it's also not unthinkable with our PlayStation Productions efforts that we explore opportunities,\" he said. \nWhile Sony has a 14.09% stake in From Software, that's not quite enough to make decisions independent of the studio's other investors, like Tencent, which acquired 16.25% of From Software around the same time Sony invested. So while PlayStation Productions might be interested in a Bloodborne horror movie one day or an Elden Ring TV series about Jar Bairn, for example, From Software and its other investors would likely need to give the green light as well. Here's hoping, though, because From Software's properties, be it Bloodborne, Elden Ring, Dark Souls, or something else, seem ripe for an on-screen adaptation. \nWhile waiting to see if anything comes of this, read about how Bloober Team is making a TV series adaptation and then read about how Sony is developing God of War, Gran Turismo, and Horizon screen adaptations after that. \n[Source: Reuters]\nWhat is your dream From Software movie or TV series?

The latest hits of streaming platforms based on games such as Cyberpunk: Edgerunners or Arcane have shown that this is the perfect time for such productions.\" \nAs noted in Babieno's writing above, The Medium will join a slew of recent video game adaptations that have found great success, like Cyberpunk: Edgerunners (Cyberpunk 2077) and Arcane (League of Legends), and others still in development, like Sony's God of War, Horizon, and Gran Turismo productions. \nFor more, read Game Informer's review of The Medium. \n[Source: Bloody Disgusting]\nAre you excited about a TV adaptation of The Medium?

The game’s official Twitter account announced that we’ll see this footage tomorrow at 8 a.m. Pacific/11 a.m. Eastern on the game’s YouTube channel. \nTrailer tomorrow. Tune in at 8am PT for the first official look at #DeadSpace gameplay.\nhttps://t.co/n9sLvsOLJS pic.twitter.com/b9GEoOZfEf\nOctober 3, 2022\nThis premiere is being dubbed as the \"first official” look at gameplay. That distinction likely means that the footage will be of a near-complete build of the game since developer Motive Studios has spent the last year releasing several behind-the-scenes videos showcasing gameplay in more unfinished forms. This transparent approach to Dead Space’s development has given fans raw looks at how the 2008 classic is being updated. Player feedback from these videos has even allowed Motive to make subtle but important changes earlier in the pipeline. With the game only a few months away, we're curious to see how all of that work has coalesced. \nDead Space launches on January 27 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

The collection draws inspiration from Sonic's aesthetic from the 1990s, with graphics inspired by art from the time. \nThose who are interested in the collection can look forward to clothing items like a cotton sweater with Sonic's image, a zip-up polar fleece, heavyweight rugby jerseys, a French terry loopback hoodie, cotton tees, and mesh shorts. The line also includes baseball caps, canvas tote bags, a necktie, and a hand-embroidered Sonic patch for blazers and other clothing items.\nYou can see a gallery of some of the items in the collection below.\n\nAccording to Jack Carlson, founder and creative director of Rowing Blazers, which has done collaborations with FILA, Umbro, the NBA, and more, the company's creations all hold important links to his personal life.\n\"A lot of it has to do with the things I loved growing up: the sports, the brands, the culture,\" he said in a press release. \"I grew up in the '90s playing Sonic the Hedgehog on the Sega Genesis. Sonic has always been such an interesting character to me. In the original games, he was a little bit brash, a little bit punk. He was different from other cartoon and video game protagonists. He was very '90s. Of course, there have been a lot of Sonic clothing capsules created over the years. I wanted to do something elevated, really beautifully made, and kind of timeless in its aesthetic. Of course, there's a kind of irony to it because Sonic himself isn't really very preppy, but that's the fun of it.\"\nThe collection retails as low as $38 to $325, though nothing is currently listed at the higher end of that spectrum just yet. The collection is live now, having launched yesterday. If you'd like to check out the collection for yourself, you can head here.",

          "description": "Google has revealed that its cloud-streaming games service, Stadia, will shut down early next year. \nMore specifically, Stadia will close down its platform and end its online servers on January 18, 2023. After that, you won't be able to access the Stadia service in any way. As for your games and hardware, Google is offering refunds \"for all Stadia hardware purchases (Stadia controllers, Founders Edition, Premiere Edition, and Play and Watch with Google TV packages) through the Stadia store,\" according to an FAQ posted by Google today. It seems like the only aspect of Stadia that won't be refunded are Stadia Pro subscriptions. However, you \"will be able to continue playing your games in Pro without further charges until the final wind down date.\" \nIf you are hoping to get a refund for your hardware, Google says \"most hardware purchases...made directly from Google\" will not require you to return your hardware. The company intends to have the majority of refunds processed by Stadia's January 18 shutdown date. \nThe Stadia Store and all its functions have been turned off so you will not be able to make any more Stadia-related purchases or in-game transactions. \nStadia shutting down isn't the most surprising news. Despite cloud gaming's continuing rise in popularity as of late thanks to the likes of Microsoft's Xbox Cloud Gaming initiative and others, Stadia never seemed to really take off. The first big sign that Stadia might not be long for this world came back in February of last year, when Google revealed it was ending its first-party game development and closing two studios. Then, this February, word got out that Google Stadia had reportedly been deprioritized by the company. Now, Stadia has just a few months left in it before it becomes a part of history. So long, Stadia. \nDid you use Stadia? What do you think of this news? Let us know in the comments below!",

It was delayed to at least March 2020 after that, but things went quiet and the game missed that window. Then, in May of last year, Ubisoft announced that Skull and Bones would release sometime between April 1, 2022, and March 31, 2023. And now, it's slipping out of its November 8 release date, which was only just announced back in July, into a new March 9, 2023 date. As for why, the team cites a need for more polish and balancing.\nKotaku's Ethan Gach says sources say the teams working on Skull and Bones are burnt out. According to Gach in his Kotaku story, the latest technical test for the game ended on September 19. One source involved with the test told Kotaku that gameplay was more refined than in previous tests but that progression needed work as it still felt too shallow. Gach writes that this is a concern shared by multiple sources close to the game's development. \nHere's what Ubisoft has to say about the delay: \nThe last the public saw of Skull and Bones in a big way was during a July showcase, which is where we saw extensive gameplay and received the now-delayed November 8 release date. I learned a lot more about the game around the same time when Skull and Bones was Game Informer's cover story. At the time, the team seemed confident in its November release date but given the history of this title, I'm not surprised it's been delayed again. \nAre you excited to play Skull and Bones next March?
