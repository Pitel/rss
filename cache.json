It isn't realism for its own sake (look no further than the automated vehicles and the ludicrous citizen behaviour to refute that), but a fundamentally different interpretation of what city building means. It's about co-ordinating all your pieces so they'll be in the right place to support each other, and how the whole is all that matters, but that whole will fail if you don't organise its parts.

He asked whether I thought it was big enough to consider the DLC a pseudo-sequel, and at the time I said something along the lines of, \"It's hefty, but I think that's probably pushing it\".\nI was wrong. The Land Of Shadow may not be as expansive as the base game's Lands Between, but it's knottier, denser, more of a twisting mass that burrows into the earth and soars into the skies. For this reason I think it produces some of Elden Ring's finest moments, as exploration leads to a truer sense of discovery reminiscent of old Souls. But I also think its sheer density exposes more chinks in its open world format, where its interconnected sprawl leads to even greater recollection paralysis.\nRead more",

I mean, I wasn't that surprised to see an open world survival shooter with monsters at the top of the ladder - why else would we dedicate a bunch of Best Of features to such things? - but I am surprised that number three is a leering parody of neglect. Also, there's a game about mopping dungeons that appeals strongly to my Dungeon Meshi-watching sensibilities.\r\n \nRead more",

The truth is the pixellated hangout zone of the early 2000s never went away. It has been alive this whole time. You forgot about the Hotel.

I'd save up to buy one of the premium headliners, attempt to get my money's worth inside a week, then swap it for a respected double-A and perhaps a sub-£8 oddity with the manual missing - nesting one purchase within the other like a series of Matryoshka dolls.\nThis was my Big Short, my Moneyball. But it had a drawback: often, I was so eager to leapfrog to another game before the trade-in price changed that I skimmed RPGs that are now considered classics. The big one was Suikoden 2, which I spent only an evening with before gambling that I'd eke more FunValue out of a game with a less traditional battle system. I can't remember what I traded that for, which says it all. Another was Baten Kaitos on Gamecube, which - yes, we are finally getting to the point here - has just been rereleased on Steam in the shape of a Baten Kaitos I & II HD Remaster. I can't remember what I traded Baten Kaitos for either, which again, says it all. Please, gentle reader - be better.\r\n \nRead more",

Leaky ceilings, busted panelling, faulty drill machinery - the omens pile up as you spend your first thirty minutes wandering through the colleague-packed canteen and over the platform into the boss' office for a severe dressing-down. It's a classic pre-disaster setup for a mostly traditional monster story, yet the game sticks expertly to the first-person horror form, and its voice actors' performances are so spot-on, that it'd feel churlish to judge this foaming fear simulator for sticking to type. It also has some markedly unsettling use of the shipping forecast, a famously dull feature of British radio I definitely did not expect to freak me out in a video game.\nRead more",

It's another indication that this will be more biffy action game than thinky party-based RPG. The upside, assuming you find that last sentence disappointing, is that exploration and combat will be more \"intimate\", and individual characters will have more screentime to bounce off each other and flourish as personalities.

This week, it was a completely context-free message containing several photos of what appear to be artificial houseplants from a man named ‘Harold’.

Without meaning any disrespect to those currently working in the genre, which I've had a tonne of fun with, when's the last time you were seriously excited by tower defence? As of this week, I am seriously excited by tower defence, because Path Of The Goddess has captured my imagination. It's a stately, beautiful thing. I had a go at this year's Keighleycon, and it's one of two games at the show I wanted to carry on playing once my time was up.

Deep Dip 2 is a fan-made tower of racetracks that was published as a challenge to the racing game's community last month. It is 16 floors of unfathomably difficult ramps, tunnels, ledges, pipes, and beams. A simple mistake sees drivers plummeting to the bottom, like the sad cauldron man of Getting Over It. The first three players to finish would share a prize pool of over $32,000. Over the weekend, one player has now managed it, and another has since joined him.

You do get a party, drawn from a retinue of seven, larger-than-life, romanceable companions encompassing a range of classes, abilities and go-faster hairdos, but control of that party has been streamlined, and there's a God Of Warlike emphasis on booting Fade demons into pits.

Respectable shinobing, for sure. Papa Tenchu would be proud.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "One of my absolute most favouritest Steam Deck cases, besides the one you get for free with the Steam Deck OLED, is the Dbrand Project Killswitch. It’s not so much a carrying vessel as a hardened second skin, providing protection without all the bag-hogging bulk of a traditional case – while throwing in handy bonuses like a clip-on kickstand and grippy thumbstick covers. For owners of the Asus ROG Ally, the recent launch of a Project Killswitch for their own handheld PC should therefore represent glad tidings with extra gladness, even if it won’t also fit the upcoming ROG Ally X.\nThank the new device’s bigger battery, wider SSD and reworked connection layout for that particular lack of forwards compatibility, as the ROG Ally X’s thicker dimensions will make it just slightly too beefy to slip into the Killswitch’s skintight silicone. A shame, but at least it makes a quality addition to the original Ally right this second. I’ve been manhandling one for a week now, and it’s just as practical and protective as the Steam Deck version.\nRead more",

She could also be the villain. Then again, Fable is a series in which you can be the villain. Egad, such shenanigans! \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Back in September 2023, GameCube card-based RPG duology Baten Kaitos made its way back to a Nintendo platform with the launch of Baten Kaitos I & II HD Remaster. While it may have been easy to miss last night's announcement, the collection is now available on Steam.\n\n\nThe Steam drop of the remastered set — which includes Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean and Baten Kaitos Origins — is priced at $49.99. Those who pick it up between now and July 1 will get upgraded to the Month 1 Edition, which packs the games with a digital art book. As Bandai Namco details, the art book includes \"concept art, character designs, historical documents, and the latest visuals\" for both games. All of the content within is in Japanese. \n\n\n\n\nBaten Kaitos series character designer Nakaba Higurashi whipped up a new illustration to commemorate the Steam release.\n\n\nIn addition to updated visuals, the remastered versions of the Baten Kaitos games add in some progression-focused features for those who just want to experience the story. There's the ability to turn on No Encounters so you can sail through the game without having to worry about battles. If you want to fight but don't want battles to impede progress, there's also an Instant KO setting that lets you defeat enemies in a single attack. \n\n\nImage via Bandai Namco\n\n\nBaten Kaitos I & II HD Remaster is 10 percent off on Steam for a limited time, so if you want to grab it now, you can do so for $44.99. \n\nThe post Baten Kaitos I & II HD Remaster goes live on Steam appeared first on Destructoid.",

I didn't until I woke up this morning, and it may just be the most bizarre gaming crossover of 2024.\n\n\nI suppose it does make some sense since the crossover is specifically with the original Mighty Morphin Power Rangers team, whose giant Zords took the form of prehistoric creatures, like a tyrannosaurus rex and a saber-toothed tiger. It's also a mod that's completely free to download, letting you dress your character up as one of the five original Rangers, complete with unique animations, and there are even optional skins for your weapons and specific dinosaurs, turning them into the Dinozords.

The Romancing SaGa series allows players to forge their own stories as they choose from an arsenal of main characters and expand their legacy, passing down powers and skills with each generation. Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven is headed to Switch on October 24, 2024.\n\n\n\n\nBased on the trailer, it looks like Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven features some pretty substantial upgrades both graphically and gameplay-wise.\n\n\nIn Romancing Saga 2 players must oversee a Royal Court, leading an empire to longevity and prosperity by dictating its economy, technology, city construction, and magic. At its core, Romancing SaGa 2 is about prospering over generations as opposed to focusing on the short term.\n\n\nThis is another one I've yet to play, primarily because it was originally released in Japan and I just never got around to playing. It looks like a great time to finally get into it with the Revenge of the Seven remake.\n\n\nRomancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven is scheduled to release on Nintendo Switch on October 24, 2024.\n\nThe post Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven coming to Switch this October appeared first on Destructoid.",

The gameplay shown off looks a lot like the Metroid Prime we’ve become accustomed to. There's even series' antagonist, Dark Samus, stepping in at the end.\n\n\nSamus is in her classic Varia suit (setting it before Metroid Fusion) and can roll into a ball. It looks like lock-on aiming has returned, which means it will feel natural to me. Rejoice! Scanning is back. The trailer opens with a battle between Federation soldiers and the Space Pirates, but it closes with a look at a more peaceful environment that could be taken straight from a JRPG.\n\n\nAnyway, take a look for yourself:\n\n\n\n\nMetroid Prime 4 is coming to Switch sometime in 2025.\n\nThe post Metroid Prime 4: Beyond gameplay trailer finally arrives, releases in 2025 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Hundred Line -Last Defense Academy- is arriving as a Nintendo Switch exclusive in early 2025.\n\n\n\n\nBoasting Danganronpa's signature art style and narrative parallels, The Hundred Line -Last Defense Academy- takes place in an apocalyptic world where mysterious, hostile creatures are invading. Playing as the protagonist, Takumi Sumino, your goal is to survive 100 days as you and your fellow classmates defend your school against these creatures. \n\n\nRight from the get-go, we see its resemblance to previous Spike Chunsoft games like those from the Danganronpa series. Some of the most notable similarities are the existence of a small animal mascot, the forced enrolment of 16 students in a questionable school, and the collapse of society as monsters destroy everything in their path. The premise is the same outside of the absence of murder mystery and case-solving, but its gameplay is vastly different.\n\n\nImage via Spike Chunsoft (Nintendo Direct)\n\n\nRather than being a primarily visual novel-based game, The Hundred Line -Last Defense Academy- features a combat grid where you'll arrange your characters and defeat waves of enemies, with things getting increasingly challenging as you progress through the 100 days. While little is known about the specifics of gameplay and combat, we at least know there's some variety here. \n\n\nThe Hundred Line -Last Defense Academy- will launch on Nintendo Switch in early 2025.

Not only does this mean the two games will be available on modern hardware, but this marks the second game's debut in the West.\n\n\nFor context, the original Ace Attorney Investigations, which sees you play as prosecutor Miles Edgeworth as he solves crimes, came out in 2010. Its sequel launched just a year later in 2011, but only in Japan, with Capcom opting not to localise it. Fans did come together to make their own translation, but many had assumed the game would never officially come to the West.\n\n\n\n\nCapcom seems eager to push Ace Attorney more nowadays, as evidenced by how all the mainline games are readily available. This includes The Great Ace Attorney duology, which was also Japan-only for many years. All in all, fans of the series are eating well.\n\n\nThis new collection will feature enhanced visuals, with more fluid and detail character animations, but there will be an option to switch to the original graphics as seen in the DS versions. Obviously, this won't be a Switch exclusive and will also launch on PC via Steam, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

Link battles off a horde of enemies to free Zelda from a crystal. However, this time around, Link gets sucked into a strange rift, and this time it's up to Zelda to step up to the plate and save Hyrule. Instead of wielding a sword, Zelda wields a mysterious staff that can duplicate items called echoes. Once the princess learns an echo of something she can re-create it however many times you like to help traverse the map and move past obstacles. \n\n\n\n\nWooden boxes, old beds, tables, and water blocks are just a few items Zelda can use. The first trailer gives players a first look at how the duplication system works. For example, Zelda duplicated multiple beds to scale a wall. Instead of traditional combat, the staff can create echoes of monsters, and each enemy has a unique set of abilities that can be used for different situations. Nintendo set out to create an experience that will be different for players, based on how they decide to use echoes. \n\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom launches on September 26, 2024.

This collection brings together such out-of-reach licensed classics as The Punisher and Marvel vs. Capcom 2.\n\n\nOkay, here’s the trailer:\n\n\n\n\nAnd here’s the list of games. Capitalization is all Capcom marketing:\n\n\n\nX-MEN CHILDREN OF THE ATOM\n\n\nMARVEL SUPER HEROES\n\n\nX-MEN VS. STREET FIGHTER\n\n\nMARVEL SUPER HEROES vs. STREET FIGHTER\n\n\nMARVEL vs. CAPCOM CLASH OF SUPER HEROES\n\n\nMARVEL vs. CAPCOM 2 New Age of Heroes\n\n\nTHE PUNISHER\n\n\n\nThis is extremely exciting to me. I’m always thrilled when old licensed games get re-released because I know it’s often a lot of hoops for the publisher to jump through. Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 is probably the top of the heap, but that doesn’t mean that the others included aren’t great on their own. \n\n\nThe more obscure entry here is The Punisher.  Rather than a fighting game,  it's a beat-’em-up where you play as the eponymous anti-hero and Nick Fury. It’s no Alien vs. Predator (hopefully, one day), but it’s appropriately violent and an excellent arcade title.\n\n\nIt comes with some bells and whistles, too. There will be Online modes with rollback netplay, and training modes for all the fighting games. There is also a spectator mode, a jukebox, and screen filters.\n\n\nMarvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics will be released later this year for Switch, PS4, and PC.\n\nThe post Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection is full of retro licensed goodness appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "During the newest Nintendo Direct, four fan-favourite classics were confirmed to be coming to the Nintendo Switch's online service. And best of all, they're dropping later today.\n\n\nThe first two are a pair of Game Boy Advance games: The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords and Metroid: Zero Mission for Game Boy Advance. The former is a compilation title that includes a GBA remake of the beloved SNES game A Link to the Past, and a multiplayer spin-off that sees four Links team up and explore randomised dungeons. This will allow for online co-op.\n\n\nImage via Nintendo\n\n\nAs for Metroid: Zero Mission, it's a GBA remake of the very first Metroid game, letting you experience an updated re-telling of Samus' first adventure. It may not be as fancy looking as Metroid Prime 4, but it's still worth playing.\n\n\nThe other two additions are a pair of Nintendo 64 games: Turok: Dinosaur Hunter and Rare's original Perfect Dark. Both of these are first-person shooters, with Turok being all about, well, hunting dinosaurs, while Perfect Dark is set in an alternate future where agent Joanna Dark goes on a mission to thwart an evil corporation. Perfect Dark will also feature online multiplayer. These two will be exclusive to Nintendo's new catalogue of mature rated titles.\n\nThe post Perfect Dark, Turok, and more are coming to Nintendo Switch Online today appeared first on Destructoid.",

We also have a release date: November 14, 2024.\n\n\nWere you betting on the original trilogy of Dragon Quest games getting a remake? Good news! The other two games are also getting remade, but they aren’t part of the same collection. Dragon Quest 1&2 2D-HD will be coming sometime in 2025.\n\n\n\n\nI’m not sure there’s much else to say. It’s a remake of the third Dragon Quest game in Square’s 2D-HD style. It’s a foundational JRPG, so maybe play it if you haven’t before.\n\n\nHonestly, Dragon Quest 3 was probably my least favorite of the four NES titles. I think it just felt really long and kind of drab. It’s still good, and I’ll definitely be getting the HD-2D remake. I’m just happy that the first two are also getting the treatment.\n\n\nDragon Quest 3: 2D-HD is coming to Switch on November 14, 2024.

          "description": "Among Us fans on Nintendo Switch, rejoice! Three new roles, two for Crewmates and one for Impostors, are being added to the game as part of a free update on June 18. \n\n\nAnnounced during the jam-packed Nintendo Direct, Crewmates can now end up with the Noisemaker or Tracker roles, while the new Phantom role for Impostors will make it even harder for your opponents to sus you out. \n\n\nNoisemakers will be able to send out a signal to everyone in the game that they've been killed, so there's no way they can be silently eliminated by the bad guys. Elsewhere, the Tracker will be able to plant a tracking device on other players and watch their movements using the in-game map. \n\n\nFor those who end up as Impostor, the Phantom role will allow you to turn invisible, which will be very handy for evading Crewmates after a kill, or sneaking into position for your next assassination. \n\n\nLet your teammates know you've been slain. Image via Innersloth\n\n\nThese three roles were first teased back on April Fool's Day, appearing briefly in the lobby during the video. The roles aren't actually live on PC or console just yet, which means that if you want to play them, you'll need to break out your Switch to give them a go. \n\n\nThe Phantom definitely seems like the most powerful of the lot, with the ability to turn invisible definitely going to lead to some awesome plays. The Tracker could also be useful if there's a player you don't trust, although giving away information that contradicts them could make you a prime target for their knife.\n\n\nThe new Among Us roles are just one of many big announcements at June 18's Nintendo Direct, including the new Mario & Luigi: Brothership and an HD version of Donkey Kong Country Returns.\n\nThe post Among Us is getting three new roles on Nintendo Switch today appeared first on Destructoid.",

MIO: Memories in Orbit is a 2D Metroidvania that is planning to be released in 2025 as a Nintendo Switch exclusive.\n\n\n\n\nIn the beautiful, vast landscapes of space, Mio: Memories in Orbit has your character, the android MIO, set out to explore the galaxy and its wonders. As MIO breaks out of its wire-covered vessel and steps foot into the world, you'll battle enemies, use your grappling hook-like abilities to climb around the terrain, and avoid various deadly obstacles to discover new areas in the universe and save your spaceship from a growing hostile force.\n\n\nDiving into its gameplay more, the world premiere reveals multiple terrain traversal methods you'll use, from a light beam acting as a grappling hook to pull you through the air to gliding, multi-jumps, and basic combat attacks. You'll use these various mechanics to defend and evade against enemies as well as avoiding challenging traps that require careful navigation.\n\n\nMio: Memories in Orbit will be available on the Nintendo Switch in 2024.

Well, now its predecessor, Donkey Kong Country Returns, is making the leap as well in early 2025.\n\n\nOriginally released in 2010, this marks the second time Donkey Kong Country Returns has seen a port, since Nintendo put it on the Nintendo 3DS as well in 2013. This Switch version seems to be a simple HD port of the original Wii game, but it will include the extra levels from the 3DS version as well.\n\n\n\n\nAside from that, it doesn't appear to boast any wholly new features or content.

Here is everything you need to know about the brief patch notes. \n\n\nUbisoft has had its hand full lately. On June 12, an update finally added an aiming penalty for players who spam jumped. In addition, sniper rifles finally recieved a nerf as XDefiant increased flinch when getting fired at. As a result, it's harder for sniper rifle users to shake off bullets. As for this time around, the update takes care of other issues that have been raised over the past few weeks.  \n\n\nXDefiant June 18 patch notes\n\n\nImage via Ubisoft \n\n\nGameplay\n\n\nSped up the process of unlocking weapon attachments by lowering the amount of XP needed to level up your primary weapon, from 3,500 to 3,000, and your secondary weapon, from 1,500 to 1,000. This change is retroactive, meaning your existing weapon levels will likely be even higher now. Pause for polite applause.\n\n\nTo counterbalance this speedier access to performance-enhancing attachments--and provide a greater challenge to the community--Weapon Mastery level requirements have increased. However, any player who has already unlocked Bronze/Silver/Gold skins will get to keep them. We're not monsters.\n\n\nNetcode\n\n\nImproved how quickly your health reacts when being shot, which should reduce the feeling of being shot behind walls.\n\n\nWeapons\n\n\nPlayers wielding the MDR while strutting around in the Firestorm skin were experiencing an abnormal level of recoil, which has been reset to normal recoil. So strut away.\n\n\nFactions\n\n\nRestored the decorum of lying down when dead to players who previously remained on their feet after dying while under the influence of Libertad's Medico Supremo ultra.\n\n\nMiscellaneous\n\n\nAdditional crash fixes.\n\nThe post XDefiant June 18 patch notes: Faster weapon leveling, improved netcode, more appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s maybe in the same wheelhouse as Animal Crossing, but not entirely. My Melody (that’s a character) is opening a store in a theme park on a tropical island, and you have been brought along to help. But the park is abandoned, and the trip can only be saved with the power of friendship.\n\n\n\n\nThere’s a character creator. You can decorate your friendship cabin. There’s baking. The press blurb says it’s over 100 hours, and I believe them. More importantly: there are no microtransactions. It’s been getting updated with new content since it was first released on iOS.\n\n\nHello Kitty: Island Adventure was really well received on Apple Arcade. It was nominated at The Game Awards 2023 for Best Mobile Game, if you remember. It lost to Honkai Star Rail because there’s no justice in our world, but it did win the Webby People’s Choice award as well as the Apple Arcade Game of the Year Award.

If you're suffering, here's everything we know about it, and what you can do to try and fix it. \n\n\nThis issue raised its head again on June 18, with VAN 82 making it impossible to log into the game. Unsurprisingly, players aren't too happy about this and want to know what's stopping them from getting into matches and dominating their opponents. (Although for me, it's more likely to get stomped.)\n\n\nNot what you want to see. Screenshot via Destructoid\n\n\nWhat does VAN 82 mean in VALORANT?\n\n\nEssentially, VALORANT's VAN 82 error means that there is a problem connecting to the game's servers. This could be on your side, or on Riot's side, but more often has to do with the game's developer. \n\n\nWhen you see VAN 82, you're not getting into a match, as the game tells you that it's \"encountered a connection error.\" \n\n\nHow to fix VAN 82 in VALORANT\n\n\nIf the problem is on Riot's end, then the bad news is that you can't do anything about it, and just have to sit tight and wait for the developer to fix it. In the meantime, keep an eye on the official server status page and wait for updates. \n\n\nIf, however, the servers are up and you're still struggling to get into games, here are a few things to try:\n\n\n\nRestart your VALORANT client: This is the fix suggested by Riot, and the easiest to do. \n\n\nRestart your PC: If your Vanguard is having an issue, sometimes restarting your PC is the best way to address it. \n\n\nRestart your internet: If you can't get into matches, it could be worth giving your entire network a reboot, just to knock out any gremlins. \n\n\nTry a different server: If nothing is working, then a different VALORANT server may help you get into the game. \n\n\n\nHopefully, some of these tips will help you out, and get you back in the game as soon as possible. \n\nThe post VALORANT’s VAN 82 error explained: What causes it & fixes appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "There's nothing worse than jumping on your PC to play a game of VALORANT just to find that the servers are down, but thanks to the VAN 84 error that is plaguing Riot's FPS, that's what's happening. \n\n\nThe error is appearing whenever you try to boot up the game, greeting you with a screen that reads: \"Connection error. VALORANT has encountered a connection error. Please relaunch the client to reconnect.\" Unfortunately, even if you close down the client and try again, you'll be met with the same problem. \n\n\nEven worse, it's not clear what's causing this issue right now, as Riot has yet to comment on it to confirm that they're aware of it or working on a fix. Speculation is running rife that it could be linked to VALORANT's Vanguard anti-cheat system, but this is unconfirmed. \n\n\nIt tells you to restart, but it won't help. Screenshot via Destructoid\n\n\nSo far, it's been radio silence from Roit, with nothing on their official X account about the outage. Even their official server status page fails to mention the problem, leaving us all in the dark about what's going on. \n\n\nUnsurprisingly, social media is filled with unhappy VALORANT players asking the developer what's going on, and pleading for them to fix the problem. It's not just the FPS that's affected either, with League of Legends players also complaining on X about the VAN 84 error. \n\n\nFor now, there's not much we can do but sit tight and wait for Riot to fix the problem. We'll be sure to update this article as soon as we hear anything from the developer, or the servers are restored. In the meantime, sign up for the VALORANT console limited beta so you try the game on a new platform when the servers are finally up. \n\nThe post VALORANT’s VAN 84 error has taken down servers and locked players out of game appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Atari and Wayforward have announced that Yars Rising, a spin-off/reimagining of the 1981 Atari 2600 title, Yars’ Revenge has a release date of September 10, 2024. They’ve also released a new trailer that covers the gameplay in better detail.\n\n\nAnnounced back in April, Yars Rising is a gated exploration (Metroidvania) game that bases itself on Yars’ Revenge. It’s a weird way to reimagine a fixed-screen shooter from the early days of home games. While the initial trailer didn’t really show much relation to the original beyond some visual references, both the demo and the trailer show a more distinct link. I’m talking about the hacking mini-games that are essentially new configurations of the classic Yars’ Revenge gameplay.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s a better trailer overall, though I’m still not sold on the aesthetic. I say that as someone who actually likes Yars’ Revenge. However, Joseph Luster tried out the demo and came to the same conclusion that he’s curious, but not wild about the game. I’m just not seeing much of a hook here.\n\n\nYars Rising still fits into Atari’s business model of adapting old licenses into smaller-budget games. So far, a lot of what I’ve experienced from the initiative is solid but unremarkable. However, with the resurrection of the Infogrames label and Nightdive and Digital Eclipse at their side, they aren’t restricting themselves to one strategy. It’s a lot better than what we had a decade ago when they last tried to resurrect Yars Revenge and Star Raiders.\n\n\nYars’ Rising will be released for Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, and PC on September 10, 2024.\n\nThe post Atari and Wayforward’s Yars Rising is out in September and looks slightly more Yar appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Uncharted 2 movie is officially in development, as confirmed by Sony’s president of international distribution Steven O’Dell, who gave the update during the 2024 CineEurope trade show, as reported by Variety.\n\n\nFor those unfamiliar, the first movie and its now-confirmed sequel are video-game adaptations of Sony and Naughty Dog’s Uncharted franchise. The first movie, released in 2022, starred Tom Holland as protagonist Nathan Drake and Victor Sullivan, Drake’s best friend, was played by Mark Wahlberg.\n\n\nBoth of the characters are expected to reprise their role. Wahlberg’s return seems to be almost confirmed, given that the actor provided an update earlier this year in an interview with Screen Rant. He revealed that the studio asked him to start growing his moustache. The actor also shared that the movie’s script is done.\n\n\n\n\nWahlberg said that the “audiences really loved the first one” which is partly a fair assessment. The movie did earn $407 million at the box office, but it didn’t receive the kind of reviews that complement its gross earnings. As it stands, Uncharted has a 40% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, a 6.3 score on IMDb, and a 45% rating on Metacritic.\n\n\nRegardless, the performance at the box office is strong enough for Sony to greenlight a sequel, and it remains to be seen how Uncharted 2 will perform upon release. However, it is still early to wonder about its reception as the movie is currently under development and with no official confirmation that Tom Holland is returning, it will be some time before Uncharted 2 hits the theatres.\n\nThe post Uncharted 2 movie is officially in development, confirms Sony appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "We recently learned about five Mega Man games arriving on Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy catalog, but Nintendo has recently focused an increasing amount of its catalog efforts on more obscure titles or those that never came to the West. With many of the most classic titles already on Nintendo Switch Online's various catalogs, the output has decreased significantly. However, during today's Nintendo Direct, four of the most requested games were announced for release today.\nMetroid: Zero Mission, the excellent Game Boy Advance remake of the original Metroid, and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords, the Game Boy Advance remake of the classic SNES title but with a separate co-op campaign, come to Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy Advance catalog. On top of that, Nintendo announced the Nintendo 64 catalog is getting two M-rated entries: Perfect Dark, the GoldenEye 007 spiritual successor from developer Rare, and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter.\nAs a reminder, the NES, SNES, and Game Boy libraries are included in the base Nintendo Switch Online subscription, while Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance, and Sega Genesis catalogs require you to upgrade to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription. As such, to access all of the games announced and released today, you'll need to subscribe to that premium membership. The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords and Metroid: Zero Mission join the Game Boy Advance library today, while Perfect Dark and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter join the Nintendo 64 catalog today.",

          "description": "In recent years, Capcom has really shown its dedication to the Ace Attorney series by bringing the games to modern consoles. The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles brought two games to the West for the first time, while the Apollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy gave the newest games in the series a facelift. Today, with the announcement of Ace Attorney Investigations Collection, Capcom is not just bringing another Japan-only release to Western gamers, but it's also made the entire library of Ace Attorney games available on modern consoles.\n\n\nThe Investigations games follow Miles Edgeworth, an antagonist turned reluctant ally from the original trilogy of Phoenix Wright games. Instead of defending suspects in court, Edgeworth is a prosecutor, so it's up to him to build a case against the main suspects. By collecting evidence and completing logic puzzles, he and the lovable Detective Gumshoe solve mysteries and serve justice. While the first game launched in the States as a DS title, the second never officially made it over, so this is many players' first chance to see its story.\nLike other Ace Attorney collections, the Ace Attorney Investigations Collection will have a number of modes and settings for fans to appreciate the art and music of the original game. While it includes new \"hand-drawn character visuals\" for a more modern look, it also allows players to switch to classic pixel sprites if they prefer the look of the original. Meanwhile, the gallery includes character art, a photo album, and music from the game, including orchestral arrangements.\nWhile the announcement was made during the Nintendo Direct, Ace Attorney Investigations collection is far from a console exclusive – the two-game collection will launch on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 6.",

Super Mario Party Jamboree is a brand-new entry in the franchise, but it’s looking as if the general thrust of play remains mostly intact, with a few notable additions.\nThe reveal trailer shows Mario and friends descending on a small archipelago of islands that make up a massive resort. Across the many boards, players can encounter 110 different minigames.\nJamboree includes five new boards – Mega Wiggler’s Tree Party, King Bowser’s Keep, Roll ‘em Raceway, Goomba Lagoon, and Rainbow Galleria – plus returning boards from earlier games, including Mario’s Rainbow Castle (From Mario Party) and Western Land (from Mario Party 2). We got to see a bit of how the board games play out in a couple of these locales. Roll ‘em Raceway includes a turbo dice item that allows player Karts to zip forward up to 40 spaces with a good roll. In Goomba Lagoon, a changing tide adjusts the path across the board.\nThe most surprising addition is the new Koopathlon game mode, which allows up to 20 players to jump in together online. The early gameplay on offer here calls to mind other online party titles like Fall Guys.\nNintendo is touting Jamboree as the largest game in the series. We’ll see how true that is when the game launches for Switch on October 17.",

The game was originally being developed by Bandai Namco, but was later restarted and moved over to Retro Studios, the developer behind the the first three Metroid Prime games.\n\n\nFinally seeing the game is action is exciting, but in a way, not surprising. The action is reminiscent of Retro's other Metroid games (which is a good thing). We see Samus land on a planet clearly in the middle of a battle in a new ship, she moves around, scans elements of the environment, attacks monsters, and turns into a Morph Ball.

Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is headed for release on January 16, 2025.\nThe new version looked great in its reveal trailer today, which showed off DK and his little buddy, Diddy Kong, making their way through a slew of jungle-themed environments, collecting bananas, popping barrels, and even riding Rambi the Rhinoceros.\nThe new remaster is set to include 80 levels, which means it will also have all the extra levels that appeared in the 2013 3DS port. The trailer also reveals plans for two-player local cooperative play.\nCheck our the new trailer for yourself below.",

If you haven't checked it out yet, today is a great day to do so, thanks to the free update that adds a brand-new chapter of gameplay.\nMystery In Monoth sees Mickey and friends lend a helping hand to Monoth's greatest detective, the trench coat-clad Dash Dolphin. In addition to what appears to be new levels packed with platforming challenges, players will get to experience some mystery-solving as well by collecting clues and evidence and connecting them using a classic bulletin board with thumbtacks and red string.\nYou can return to the land of Monoth to snoop and sleuth when the Mystery In Monoth update drops later today.",

          "description": "During today's Nintendo Direct, developer Mistwalker announced that its popular RPG Fantasian would be making the leap to Switch later this year in an enhanced version called Fantasian Neo Dimension. The title arrived as an Apple Arcade exclusive in 2021 and currently holds an 80 out of 100 on reviews aggregate site Metacritic. It also won the award for Mobile game of the Year at the 25th Annual DICE Awards. \nMistwalker was founded in 2004 by Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, who produced Fantasian. The studio frequently collaborates with longtime Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu, who also worked on Fantasian as the composer. To date, Mistwalker has released multiple critically acclaimed games, including Blue Dragon, Lost Odyssey, and The Last Story.\nFantasian uses similar turn-based design conventions as were found in many of the most classic Final Fantasy games. The title also implements several quality-of-life modernizations, such as the ability to skip random encounters with enemy types you've already defeated until they choose to fight them all at once. Despite being a mobile title, Fantasian's ties to Apple Arcade means it does not include any microtransactions or paid DLC.\nFantasian Neo Dimension arrives on Nintendo Switch this holiday season.",

          "description": "Yars Rising is the successor of the 1982 Atari classic Yars' Revenge. However, on the surface, it has little to do with the original game created by Howard Scott Warshaw. After all, one is a 2D space shooter while another is a modernized sci-fi Metroidvania. However, with homages to Atari and gaming's past galore, all developed by a renowned studio like WayForward, this release could be one to look forward to when it arrives on its newly announced September release date.\nTaking control of a hacker named Emi (codename Yar), players must blast, hack, and sneak their way through various areas. As she progresses, she unlocks new powers that allow her to take out enemies more easily and, in true Metroidvania fashion, access new areas. Yars Rising is published by Atari and pays homage to the company's past, including bosses and minigames that borrow gameplay elements from classic Atari titles.\nThough the game is coming to a broader array of platforms, PlayStation 5 and Switch players can pick up physical editions of the game. We recently had a chance to go hands-on with Yars Rising and included our impressions in our list of the coolest things we saw at Summer Game Fest. To read that entry and see the rest of the list, head here. Yars Rising arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on September 10.",

This means that players will have the opportunity to drive around Mexico in a 2024 Ford Mustang Dark Horse, 2023 Hyundai IONIQ 5 N, 2021 Toyta GR Yaris, 2023 Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo Turbo S, and 2023 Kia EV6 GT. However, for many, those are unlikely to be the highlight of this batch of releases. Available tomorrow, Forza Horizon 5 is bringing several iconic vehicles from Universal Studios films and TV shows.\nThe Universal Icons Car Pack adds KITT from Knight Rider, Jurassic Park's 1992 Jeep Wrangler Sahara, and a distinct version of the Delorean Time Machine from each Back to the Future film in the trilogy. Each Time Machine features a unique look and visual effects once you hit 88 miles per hour. The Jurassic Park Wrangler features the park's logo as well as the iconic color scheme from the film. Finally, KITT includes a body kit that includes Super Pursuit Mode.\nThis isn't the first time Forza Horizon 5 has introduced licensed vehicles from pop-culture properties. Players can already purchase the Forza Horizon 5: Fast X Car Pack as well as the Forza Horizon 5: Hot Wheels expansion. In addition to those aforementioned vehicles, this season adds 17 EventLab props to help players build modern highways and a robot collectible out in the world.\nWe absolutely loved Forza Horizon 5 when it came out in 2021, awarding it a 9.5 out of 10, naming it one of the top 10 games of 2021, and awarding it both Best Microsoft Exclusive and Best Racing Game for that year. The Universal Icons Car Pack will be available tomorrow, June 18. The Mustang arrives on June 20, the IONIQ and EV6 land in-game on June 27. The Yaris comes out on July 4 and the Taycan on July 11.",

The studio is the latest to be closed by the troubled company over the last 10 months. \nPieces Interactive’s website now only features a graphic listing “2007-2024 Thanks For Playing With Us” and a short blurb detailing its history: \nAlone in the Dark launched on March 20 to mixed reviews, currently sitting at a 63 on Metacritic. The game stars actors Jodie Comer and David Harbour, who lent their voices and likenesses, in a third-person reimagining of the 1992 survival horror classic. \n\n\nFollowing the collapse of a $2 billion deal with the Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group in 2023, Embracer has undergone a massive restructuring to stay afloat, resulting in a significant reduction of headcount across its many studios. That has included laying off over 1,000 employees (including those at Eidos-Montreal), selling off its studios (Saber Interactive, Gearbox Entertainment), and outright closing others (Free Radical Design, Volition Games). Embracer has most recently split itself into three separate companies, with its studios divided among them.",

          "description": "Fans of the A Quiet Place films may remember that a video game based on the franchise was announced almost three years ago. After years of worrying yet oddly appropriate silence, publisher Saber Interactive has revealed the title and first trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead.\nThe first-person adventure is an original story starring a young woman who must trek across a new area of the film’s post-apocalyptic landscape for unknown reasons (though the game’s description mentions she’s dealing with some kind of family drama). Like the movies, keeping quiet to avoid the wrath of the sound-sensitive alien invaders requires using tools such as a customized microphone that measures the sound levels in an area. \n\n\nStealth is key, and players must carefully observe environments to create their own paths while avoiding noise-making hazards such as stepping on broken glass, as seen in the video. The trailer didn’t show any combat, but if it’s anything like the films, guns are likely to be present but perhaps deemphasized (they're quite loud, you see). \nInterestingly, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead seems to have switched developers. When the game was first announced, Illogika was at the helm. Now, the game credits Stormind Games, the team behind the Remothered horror series and, most recently, Batora: Lost Haven. \nA Quiet Place: The Road Ahead was originally slated to launch in 2022, the same year A Quiet Place Part II hit theaters. With this trailer arriving ahead of the June 28 premiere of A Quiet Place: Day One, the game is again riding the momentum of a new film release. A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is coming sometime this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

          "description": "Developer-publisher Dragami Games has revealed that Lollipop Chainsaw RePop, its remaster of the 2012 zombie action game, will launch September 25 on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. Dragami revealed this release date in RePop's first trailer, which shows off some of the remastered gameplay and the characters players will meet in the game.  Lollipop Chainsaw represents a collaboration between Goichi \"Suda51\" Suda (No More Heroes, Killer7), and Guardians of the Galaxy director and now DC film head James Gunn. At the time of Lollipop Chainsaw's release, Gunn was known primarily for directing the films Slither and Super, and writing the two live-action Scooby Doo films and Zach Snyder's Dawn of the Dead remake. We spoke with Suda51 recently about his career and whether or not he keeps up with James Gunn.\nAlongside the trailer, Dragami has also released various details related to the remaster of Chainsaw Lollipop, including word that PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC players can enjoy the game with 4K resolution and 60 FPS (the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch versions support 1080p resolution and 30 FPS). Dragami says RePop has shorter load times, improved camera and keystroke response, increased attack speed, and faster movement speed, too. \nPlus, the Chainsaw Blaster now has \"auto rock on,\" an auto-fire mode, and an increased maximum ammunition count, while combos are now usable from the start of the game. Nick Roulette has received some changes, and so have minigames. Plus, a new auto-QTE feature is on by default now. \nCheck all of it out for yourself in the Chainsaw Lollipop RePop gameplay trailer below: \n\n\nLollipop Chainsaw RePop will be available on September 25 for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. \n For more, read Game Informer's original Lollipop Chainsaw review here. \nAre you going to be playing Chainsaw Lollipop RePop this September?

Currently, you can only use Discord on PS5 after first joining a voice chat group via a PC or phone, which is quite a cumbersome step to take in order to talk with friends while gaming. \nThe update will gradually roll out to PS5 players in the coming weeks, starting first with Japan and Asia, followed by Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and the Middle East, and finally, North and South America. You will need to update your console to the latest system software and link your PlayStation Network and Discord accounts in order to take advantage of this upcoming feature. \n\n\nTo start a Discord voice chat directly from a PS5, players need to select the Discord tab in the Control Center's Game Base. Here, choose a Discord server or DM group you'd like to join, select your preferred voice channel, and you're set. You will receive a notification when another Discord user calls you, too, allowing you to join immediately. \nThis upcoming update will arrive more than two years after PlayStation gave players the ability to link their PSN accounts to Discord back in 2021. \nAre you excited about this update?

It did so with a new Visions of Mana trailer that runs for nearly four minutes and features plenty of gameplay and details about the upcoming RPG. \nFor the uninitiated, Visions of Mana is the first new mainline game in the franchise in 15 years. Across its 30 years of existence as a franchise, there have been 17 games, though what is now the Mana series today actually began as Final Fantasy Adventure in 1991.\nIn the trailer, we get a look at the five playable characters, including Soul Guard Val (voiced by Stephen Fu), Oracle of Wind Careena (voiced by Rachel Rial), Radiant Sword Morley, (voiced by Kaiji Tang), Queen of the Deep Palamena (voiced by Vanessa Lemonides), and Woodland Custodian Julei (voiced by Amber Aviles). Players can swap these characters in and out to create three-person parties and can change each character's class to attune to different elements. They won't be alone, though, as non-player companions can assist the player's party in combat, according to the trailer. \nCheck out the Visions of Mana release date trailer for yourself below:\n\n\nThe standard edition of Visions of Mana will cost $59.99, but there is a Collector's Edition for $199.99 that features a Ramcoh plush, the Art of Mana special issue, a Visions of Mana original soundtrack collector's edition special box, and of course, the physical game. However, Square Enix says the PlayStation 4 standard and collector's edition will not be available in the U.S. \nHere's a look at the Visions of Mana Collector's Edition: \nVisions of Mana hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on August 29. \nFor more about the game, watch the Visions of Mana reveal trailer, and then check out this gameplay trailer from earlier this year. \nAre you going to be playing Visions of Mana this August?

Set to premiere in November, show creators Christian Linke and Alex Yee confirm the upcoming season will be the show's last.\n\n\nSeason 2 is billed as \"the final chapter\" and will center on Jinx's attack on the Council, which will be the centerpiece of the escalating Piltover/Zaun conflict. Hailee Steinfeld (Vi) and Ella Purnell (Jinx) will reprise their roles in Season 2. While Arcane will conclude, Christian Link stated during a League of Legends dev update today that it won't be the last animated tale based on the franchise. \n“Arcane is just the beginning of our larger storytelling journey and partnership with the wonderful animation studio that is Fortiche,\" said Linke. \"From the very beginning, since we started working on this project, we had a very specific ending in mind, which means the story of Arcane wraps up with this second season.

The open-world scoundrel game shows protagonist Kay Vess, a thief looking to start a new life, trying to hunt down a gunslinger to learn her talents. This takes her from a space station marketplace to Tatooine's iconic Mos Eisley. \nThe 10-minute guided walkthrough focuses on one aspect of Outlaws, which is tracking down elusive experts in order to learn their craft. From being the fastest draw in the galaxy to mastering sleight of hand, these skills will help Kay go from a common (though wanted) thief to a legendary outlaw. The video shows off the seamless ground-to-ship gameplay, one of the optional space dogfights you can engage in, speeder bike gameplay across the sands of Tatooine, as well as stealth and shootout sequences. \n\n\nIf you'd like a more condensed summary of what Star Wars Outlaws entails, another trailer serves as a shorter tour through some of the planets players will visit, the characters they'll meet, the systems at play, and a glimpse into some story moments. \n\n\nStar Wars Outlaws launches on August 30 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.\nThis is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.\nIf you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.\nNow, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)\n>",
