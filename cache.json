          "description": "No more. No less.\nAfter Bioware's Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic wowed audiences with its in-depth storytelling and RPG mechanics in 2003, publisher LucasArts decided that a sequel would have to be made as soon as possible. Much akin to how Majora’s Mask came out barely a year after Ocarina of Time changed the game, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II was fired out as soon as developer Obsidian Entertainment could possibly make it and released a little less than a year and a half after its predecessor. Considering that an entirely new development team of just seven people took over for this entry while still meeting that narrow deadline, it’s truly a miracle that the final product turned out as good as it did. As a standalone that was evidently rushed to market, KOTOR II may overall feel weaker than its predecessor, but it also does a fantastic job of maintaining the high standards previously set in storytelling and gameplay.\nBefore we get too into the weeds, we think it bears mentioning that this re-release on modern platforms brings with it the opportunity to finally play the game KOTOR II was originally envisioned as before the demands of the deadline necessitated that the dev team cut content. A free post-launch patch — The Sith Lord Restored Content DLC — is coming which will bring this missing content back by reworking the entire final act of the game with a whole new level, hundreds of bug fixes, adjusted cutscenes, new enemy encounters, and expanded dialogue with important characters. Those of you who have played this in the past on PC may already be familiar with the content (which comes courtesy of a fan-developed mod) but suffice to say this is an exciting new chapter for a game viewed by many as not living up to its full potential in its original form. If you're after the 'complete' KOTOR II package, this re-release will offer that — if not at launch.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

We say might because, with these kinds of games, you can never tell what you're going to get, but we're excited to get some hands-on time with the shmup segments to see just how everything blends together.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Choose House Hack 'n' Slash.\nIt's been five whole years already since Nintendo's Fire Emblem and Koei Tecmo's Warriors series first collided, resulting in the rather magnificent Fire Emblem Warriors, a game we called \"one of the best Musou outings yet\" that \"combines enjoyable combat with real-time tactics, faithfully paying tribute to the two franchises it fuses together.\"\nYes, we may have been somewhat concerned in the run-up to 2017's hack-and-slash spectacular, fearing that we'd get little more than a bog-standard Musou effort with a quick Fire Emblem reskin, but our fears proved unfounded as Omega Force and Team Ninja managed to serve up a delightful melding of two unexpected bedfellows. Here was a game that successfully took the strategy and relationship elements of Nintendo's turn-based tactical RPG and fused them with the OTT action of Koei Tecmo's long-running Musou franchise, resulting in a delightful experience that sits alongside the likes of Hyrule Warriors as the very best the genre has delivered in the past ten years.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Now presumably you’ve chosen some obscure sport that Mario hasn’t played because you saw where this bit was going, but that doesn’t change the fact that our red plumber chap hasn’t been in a hell of a lot of sports games — he mainly sticks to golf, with a little baseball on the side. Mario Strikers: Battle League attempts to carry on the legacy of the much-beloved Strikers series, but does this third entry achieve the hat-trick we’d all love to see?\nWhen you boot up the game you’ll be presented with various modes. Quick Battle allows you to jump into a game right away, setting the duration, how skilled the CPU is, whether or not you want items and/or Hyper Strikes to be enabled (more on those later), and whether the game should take place in the daytime or at night. This is the basic mode that most people will bust out when playing with friends, and thankfully you can do so on a single console (with up to eight players at a time), local wireless, and over that new-fangled internet that you might have heard of. If you want to play a quick game of Strikers, this is likely where you’ll go.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Up and down they go, covering distances seemingly impossible for their tiny, wiry frames, yet without coming to any harm whatsoever. It's an instinct the team at BlueTwelve Studio know all too well, having modelled their unnamed cat protagonist in their debut adventure game Stray after a couple of their own feline companions - and colleagues, it turns out.\n\"About 80% of the team are cat owners, or are being owned by a cat depending on how you see it,\" says producer Swann Martin-Raget. \"We actually have two cats that are joining us almost everyday at the office and are working with us. The main character is based on one of the director's cats called Murtaugh. He's not an exact copy, but he's the main reference. We also have Oscar, who is a Sphynx, a furless cat, so he's a very good reference for animation because we can clearly see all the movements. We also have a lot of strays that we've adopted, but yeah, we definitely are huge cat lovers and these animals are fascinating to us.\"\nRead more",

          "description": "Going into my chat with Steve Piggott and Rasmus Löfström of Torn Banner Studios, I thought I had a reasonable grasp of the developer’s trajectory up to that point. After finding success in 2012 with their breakout hit Chivalry: Medieval Warfare, Torn Banner had gone on to compose the difficult second album Mirage: Arcane Warfare – an Arabian Nights-inspired take on Chivalry’s multiplayer melee combat. Mirage had not been as well-received as Chivalry, yet despite this stumbling block, the studio had found its feet again with Chivalry 2, a souped-up sequel to their earlier work with more nuanced combat, bigger maps, and support for 64-player battles.\nIt turns out that, while broadly correct, I wildly underestimated Torn Banner’s reversal of fortunes. In the five years between the launch of Mirage and Chivalry 2’s impending Steam release, Torn Banner has gone from a studio on the brink to being more successful than its leadership ever imagined.\nRead more",

          "description": "Hello folks. Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve written one of these Letters From The Editor. Things have been… manic, to say the least. Manic in the traditional ‘busy’ sense (hello Elden Ring, PAX, V Rising and now notE3 planning), but also in the ‘man, there are so many cool things I want to talk to you about but aren’t quite ready to announce yet’ sense. I’ve been on the cusp of writing about these things every single month since, err, March, but then something falls through, the weeks go by, and we’re back to square one again. So I’m sorry about that, I really am. \nWhat I’m writing to you about today still isn’t one of those exciting things, unfortunately, but it is nonetheless very important. When we relaunched our RPS Supporter Programme last year, we did so on June 17th, which means its one-year anniversary is just around the corner. It also means that those of you who signed up for our yearly supporter tier will be coming to the end of your subscription soon, and I wanted to explain a little bit about the renewal process as it’s… err, a bit convoluted. Sorry again about that.\nRead more",

So, it came as no surprise when I found myself testing out the closed alpha of yet another of their ilk: Ripout, an upcoming sci-fi horror FPS that's very Doom 3.\nWhat's nice is that vidbud Liam joined me! Both because he's a fan of the FPS genre and to be present with a jar in hand, lest I crumbled into dust. Thankfully this didn't happen and we had a pretty swell time, I'd say.

          "description": "Xalavier Nelson Jr has a bit of a love hate relationship with screens right now. As development on his studio’s gutsy market game Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator was wrapping up at the end of last year, he tells me he remembers “just being really angry at the concept of the borders of the screen”. He was, by his own admission, in “a vague fugue state” at the time, having spent months immersed in Space Warlord’s black and green trading interfaces. But the feeling of having his game “chained to these walls” at the edge of his monitor proved to be a surprisingly powerful one - so much so that it spurred Nelson Jr and his team at Strange Scaffold to create an entirely new kind of game in the months leading up to Warlord’s release: Witch Strandings.\r\n\nThat's right. Taking cues from Hideo Kojima’s hiking postal sim Death Stranding, Witch Strandings is a game that not only asks what Sam Bridges’ cross-country cargo routes might look like if they were made with a fraction of Kojima’s development budget, but also how games can create experiences that are “larger than my screen,” says Nelson Jr. And the answer, it turns out, lies in your PC’s humble mouse.\nRead more",

It turns out that, not only are there a lot of locations in Elden Ring, but the definition of a distinct location is largely up for debate. The opening area of Limgrave, for example, could be as many as four separate regions (East Limgrave, West Limgrave, Stormhill and Weeping Peninsula) depending on how you interpret it. That's not to mention all of the dungeons, caves, chapels, and other landmarks scattered throughout the Lands Between.\nYet like a newly minted Wretch squaring up to Margit the Fell Omen for the first time, I am prepared to plough on despite the pain that awaits. Below you'll find a comprehensive ranking of Elden Ring's major regions and legacy dungeons, based on the admittedly woolly criteria of how fun and interesting each location is to explore. So grab your map, put on your boots, and update your life insurance policy as we embark upon a grand tour of From Software's magnificent fantasy realm.\nRead more",

Oh, and obviously spending time on a beach somewhere hot, purposefully ignoring that horrible bit where you try to get your socks back on after taking a dip in the ocean and the sand scrapes against your skin.\r\n\n\r\nOK, so maybe summer isn’t all it’s cracked up to be.

It's already much more polished than the demo, with more yet to come. It's a life sim with a bit of a Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing vibe, except instead of farming you are a witch called Ellie (size: small) living in a biome (type: forest).\nIn the story you start to free the nearby village from cursed vines, and this requires that you catalogue and collect ingredients for spells, and thence expand your repertoire of witchy recipes. At the same time you can trade spells and magical candy with locals for currency, which you can use to improve your little machines - a roaster, a caldron, a press for ingredients - to make even better things, more efficiently. It's a satisfying process of mastery and exploration. But that is not the important bit. The important bit is that Little Witch In The Woods is disgustingly adorable.\nRead more",

We got nothing on Intel’s Arc graphics cards, and Nvidia’s keynote revealed some new DLSS games but otherwise went light on GeForce deets.\r\n\n\r\nThat said, this year’s show wasn’t a bust either: there was fresh AMD Ryzen 7000 info, Corsair’s first crack at a gaming laptop and, at long last, some PCIe 5.0 SSDs you can actually buy. One day. In the future. That’s in addition to the wackier, moon-shooting tech on display, without which it just wouldn’t be Computex.

In a community post, AMD asserted this particular Preview Driver could provide double-digit percentage gains in games running DirectX 11; claims that were backed up by early independent testing, like the creator of benchmarking tool CapFrameX getting an extra 24% out of Crysis Remastered.\r\n\n\r\nThis week, AMD Software Adrenaline Edition 22.5.2 released, making that new Radeon driver available to anyone who didn’t fancy switching to preview builds. Armed with an RX 6500 XT (a low-end card that desperately needs a performance kick), I gave the new software a whirl – and found that, for all those big numbers, Radeon owners should probably lower their expectations.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Unless there’s a direct sequel, you must pull your pants up and shelve those emotions and move on.\nNot that I struggle with letting go of characters and stories particularly, but my brain makes an exception for the Yakuza games. More specifically, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio's games. I’ve reached a point where I’m ordering Lost Judgment with no intention of playing it for months - maybe even a year?

Proceed at your own risk.\nIt's like I'm really there\nOne of the things I love about games is how much they lean into genre fiction. Games have never been afraid to lean hard into sci-fi, fantasy, westerns, apocalypse stories, and so on. This means we get a lot of stories that stand out with their unique characters, mechanics, and lore, but one of my favorite aspects of games has to be how settings take on a whole personality of their own. Rather than serving as a backdrop for the action, so many game settings take a front seat in the story, driving home its themes and moving the plot forward.\nPerhaps my favorite example of great settings in games comes from the BioShock series.

These public flights offer a chance to test things out, stress them a bit, and provide some feedback to the team.\nIf you're hoping to get some network co-op in, you're able to sign up for the program here on the Halo Waypoint.\nhttps://twitter.com/Halo/status/1534233991972257792\nKeep in mind, this is just the insider test that's rolling out in July. 343 Industries is still targeting later this year for the official launch of campaign co-op. And note that that's network campaign co-op, too, so no split-screen just yet.\nCarrying on the fight\nCampaign co-op has been an elusive addition for Halo Infinite. First it slipped the launch window, then was pushed into 2022, and now it seems to be aiming for an August launch.\nThe Forge, Halo's extensive custom map and content creation tool, has also been pushed back a few times as well. At least with test flighting on the way for co-op, odds seem good that 343 Industries is closing in on a launch.\nThat might help 343 set a better tone for Halo Infinite moving forward too. The post-launch rollout has had some bumps, with the team acknowledging a \"bumpy start\" to Halo Infinite Season 2 last month.\nCampaign co-op and the Halo series are synonymous for me, so it's safe to say that the full launch of online campaign co-op would definitely get me to boot Infinite back up. The latest Halo has been something I enjoy going back to every couple of months for a few quick matches of Team Slayer and Big Team Battle, but I'd love to see 343 finally roll out the heavy hitters it's been working on.\nThe post Halo Infinite campaign co-op testing will start in July appeared first on Destructoid.",

This grisly and alternate take on undead life in the American Frontier will hit PC and console platforms September 20.\nDeveloped by studio Flying Wild Hog, who sure know their way around an exploding head or three, Evil West sees players don the hat and poncho of a lone gunslinger, one of the last remaining members of a clandestine monster-hunting society. As a terrifying and bloodthirsty battalion of vampires, ghoulies, and legions of the undead emerges to lay waste to the Old West, it is up to our hero to lay down a law that goes way beyond a sheriff's badge, and put these decaying varmints back in the ground. Permanently.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O35NOsTIoE\nOne or two players can saddle up for a hyper-violent campaign that will follow our outlaws as they forge a path through America's formative towns, cities, and wildlands, facing off against an army of ungodly creatures and offering all a date with oblivion. In typical Flying Wild Hog fashion, Evil West is loaded for bear with a huge arsenal of explosive, anachronistic weaponry, while players will also earn perks and upgrades to help turn the tide of battle in their favor.\nIt's a really cool setup, and I'm liking what I'm seeing in both the chaotic, cathartic gameplay and the atmospheric old-west-horror cutscenes. Evil West already looks to be one of those titles that might not be making a huge impact on the radars of the gaming community, but will prove to be one of the year's slickest and most compelling shooter experiences.\nEvil West launches September 20 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post Evil West brings its gory gunslinging to PC and consoles in September appeared first on Destructoid.",

As a reminder, Nintendo describes Aionios as \"the rich world where you’ll begin your journey to end the cycle of violence between two opposing nations in Xenoblade Chronicles 3.\" Those two nations are Agnus and Keves. Through the clip below, we're able to get a glimpse at some of the verticality of exploration, some teases into a few structures that will likely have story ramifications, and of course, several enemy designs.\nFor me, it's hard for the team to really top Satorl Marsh from the first game. It's such a gorgeous area and it's the first thing I think of when I hear the phrase \"Xenoblade Chronicles.\" Walking through it was a joy in the original and made me recall some of the best zones from '90s JRPGs, and going back through it in the Switch edition was a treat.\nXenoblade Chronicles 3 locations trailer:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5w6ANGPFTw\nThe post Leave it to Xenoblade Chronicles 3 to deliver more beautiful locations appeared first on Destructoid.",

As I said at the time, you sometimes have to \"do the thing to do the thing\", and if Bend delivers a major hit for Sony with this new project, then perhaps the parent company will see to making Days Gone 2 a reality.\nIn related news, Bend Studio also revealed its new branding, complete with a snazzy new logo. The company has opened up numerous job listings for a wide variety of designers, coders, artists, and animators.

          "description": "The animated tease is the most interesting part so far\nSo the unveiling of Sonic Frontiers gameplay didn't really go as planned for Sega, but they did tease an interesting departure from the open world formula: animated story sequences. Thanks to a new Sonic Central stream, we got a small tease of Sonic Frontiers story details.\nThere's two teases afoot, actually, both in the same day. One comes from the latest IGN video, which provides a snippet of the story:\n\"After flying into a wormhole with Tails and Amy, Sonic finds himself separated from his friends and all alone on an isolated island, with nothing but an AI voice guiding him to collect the Chaos Emeralds.\"\n\nSo the obvious takeaways here are that Tails and Amy are a part of Frontiers, and that we possibly won't get an overload of \"friends.\" Remember the tenuous original story tidbit shared by Sega back during the announcement, too, which was subsequently removed from Polygon's report due to Sega deeming it \"incorrect:\"\n\"In Sonic Frontiers, Sonic’s long-time nemesis Dr. Eggman discovers an ancient technology on the Starfall Islands and installs his AI program SAGE to hack in and take over. But there is more to this technology than he realizes, and unintended consequences immediately come to bear. Sonic must race against time to discover the truth, save his friends, and maybe even save himself at the same time.\"\n\nThe second recent tease comes via a short clip in the Sonic Central stream that's literally just a few seconds, we see Knuckles at the top of the stairs seemingly guarding an emerald [probably the master]. The full short will be shared \"later this year, prior to the release of Sonic Frontiers.\" Remember, this story will be penned by Sonic comic writer Ian Flynn, and right now, it's the most intriguing part of this new entry.\nThe post We got our first glimpse into the story of Sonic Frontiers appeared first on Destructoid.",

The next one will be a Stardew Valley Switch Online trial, limited to Australia, Europe, and Japan currently.\nWith my European and Japanese Switch accounts (they're helpful for reporting!), I was able to see the notification in the \"news\" sections at the bottom of the Switch UI. The trial will run from June 13 (12:00 JST) through June 19 (17:59 JST). Australia even has an eShop page up for it.\nIf you somehow haven't played Stardew Valley yet, now is the time, provided you're able to take part in the trial. It's tough to really put into words how magical this game is that hasn't already been said, but suffice to say a few hours with it should give you a clue as to whether or not you're going to be spending another 100 hours with it.\nAlso note that you should be able to take advantage of the extra My Nintendo mission points once the trial is live. As a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward.\nThe post The next Switch Online game trial is Stardew Valley, in select regions appeared first on Destructoid.",

Valve did not release a full list of the available titles, but a short trailer — which you can check out below — references a huge variety of spunky young developers and publishers, all of whom are no doubt hoping that you will find a few minutes to check out their wares.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gnu-nh4NI0Y\nAccording to the above video's description, the Steam Next Fest trailer spotlights (deep breath) Arksync, BROK the InvestiGator, Cult of the Lamb, Daydream Forgotten Sorrow, Exophobia, Foretales, Gestalt Steam Cinder, Glimmer in Mirror, Harmony's Odyssey, King of the Hat, LEGO Bricktales, Misc. A Tiny Tale, Nine Sols, Eyes in the Dark, Fays Factory, and Ghost Song. Of course, these titles make up just a sliver of the demos that will be spotlit during the event.\nSteam Next Fest will end on Monday, June 20, so you have a full seven days to check out as many demos as you choose.

While it currently errors out if you try and download/access it, the listing clearly points to a demo reveal that will likely happen in the near future, so keep an eye out for it: especially if you pre-ordered already.\nTypically, Warriors demos involve several early stages, potential access to the world map, and the ability to free play until a certain point in the game. At that point, you should be able to carry over progress into the full version. So for fans, it should be a meaty dive into what Three Hopes has to offer, and provide a glimpse into the new take on the storyline, as well as any potential gameplay adjustments.\nOf course, it'll also be an important showcase for something that's deeply impacted Warriors games, especially on Switch: performance. While some can live with framerate issues, others can't, and Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes demo will need to put its best foot forward if it wants to sell more people on the game leading up to launch. Performance hasn't stopped Omega Force and company before, though!\nAgain, when it goes live, you'll find it here, or on the eShop proper.\n[Update: Nintendo has confirmed that the Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes demo is live as of 10:00AM ET June 8, 2022!

But producer Hideki Kamiya thinks you should.\nWe've been through this before in the past. As recently as four months ago, Kamiya noted that folks who played the original two games would get more out of the threequel, which is still slated for later this year. Now he's taken to Twitter this week to reiterate that this is still his stance.\nHere's what he says, roughly translated:\n\"Somehow I wanted to say this again, but if you are thinking of playing Bayonetta 3, I definitely want you to play Bayonetta 1 and Bayonetta 2 by now ... I think that person can enjoy the story 100 times more.\"\n\nKamiya notes that with the second game, he \"intentionally created a story where you can play it in any order\" and not be too lost. But with Bayonetta 3, he worked on the story in such a way that he assumes enough people are aware of the series to have played it, and wanted to make the world-building elements \"more profound\" with that background informing the audience. He goes on to share this \"introductory video\" of the first two games (which is in Japanese).\nNaturally, if Bayonetta 3 is anything like its predecessors, it'll stand on its own two feet as an action game, even if you skip the entire story. But I really want to see what the third game has up its sleeve now that we have a full-on universe on our hands at this point.\nKamiya answers the question: \"Should you play Bayonetta 1 and 2 before 3?\"\nhttps://twitter.com/PG_kamiya/status/1534005515432660994\nThe post Kamiya once again urges folks to play Bayonetta 1 and 2 before 3 appeared first on Destructoid.",

But in the modern era of \"solved design\" (I'm using quotes liberally here) and roster-update-centric sports games, and the extreme homogenization of the genre, a silly soccer game with Mario characters in it is going to at least spark some interest on my end.

          "description": "The not-so-Nice Guys\nIn a week expected to be jam-packed with rumors and leaks, the loudest whispers of the past 24 hours concern Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima and his studio, Kojima Productions — according to the word around town, the studio is preparing to reveal a brand new horror title, going by the name of \"Overdose.\"\nThe rumor was sparked by professional spoiler Tom Henderson, who has an uncanny knack for being very right in these matters. Writing on Try Hard Guides, Henderson claims to have already seen the first teaser trailer for Overdose, which sees a young woman — played by Margaret Qualley of Death Stranding, The Nice Guys, and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood — picking her way through a creepy corridor by torchlight.\nWhile this remains a mere rumor at present, Henderson's word has been proven correct on numerous occasions. In fact, (as noted by VGC) Henderson has gone on to claim that Kojima Productions has directly requested the removal of his words, in a tweet that has itself been removed. If Kojima and pals are preparing to reveal Overdose, then one would surmise that we can see it during this season's gaming news digest — perhaps during Thursday's Summer Game Fest, hosted by Kojima's speed-dial buddy Geoff Keighley.\nEither way, it's exciting news, people have been linking Hideo Kojima to horror for many years, (lest we forget P.T.), and he has already proven he knows his way around a creepy character or two in the Metal Gear and Death Stranding titles. If Overdose exists, then it could prove to be the realization of the scary, Silent Hill-type adventure that has eluded the studio thus far.\nThe post Rumor: Kojima Productions set to reveal new horror title Overdose appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Meet Apollo, the god of music\nHades is one of my favorite games of all time. It was my go-to game at the start of the pandemic, and after all was said and done I think I put close to 400 hours into that bad boy. I have played and replayed Hades to death, so anything new to help switch it up is a welcome change. Enter Apollo — the Greek god of music who was left off of the game's original lineup, but has since been added to the game by way of a mod thanks to AlexKage's project, OlympusExtra, which was originally spotted by ResetEra.\nThe mod adds Apollo to the game as if he were just like any of the other gods, including Boons (solo and duo), a Keepsake, a Wrath (you know, the environmental attack the gods spring on you when you're in a two-Boon chamber), and of course, plenty of dialogue. An artist named Reikiix did Apollo's portrait, which honestly looks so good you can't tell that it wasn't part of the base game.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbeHCKiDB7M\nApollo's specialty is a blinding effect, which makes enemies more likely to miss their attacks. I can imagine that would go really well with Aphrodite or Athena's Boons if you want to go for a low-damage or even no-hit run. There are already some videos out there of modders playing with the Apollo mod, so those might be worth checking out if you want to see what he can do to help Zagreus escape the Underworld.\nOlympusExtra is still in its early stages — not only will Apollo's inclusion of the game be more built out in the future with some more voice lines and duo Boons on the way, but other gods will also be added to the mix, including Hera, Hestia, and Hephaestus. Hades has fostered a huge cult following since its release in 2020, and it's great to see the modding community getting in on the action.\nThe post This Hades mod adds Apollo to the game’s roster of gods appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "...And the clock's ticking, dude\nAs part of the Limited Run Games summer showcase, wherein the retailer revealed its long laundry list of physical releases for 2022-2023, it was announced that Dotemu's cool-looking brawler TMNT: Shredder's Revenge will be getting a hard copy on PS4, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.\nAll three versions will include a disc/cart-based copy of Shredder's Revenge, a full-color art booklet, a set of character stickers, a reversible cover, and, in a nice little throwback, a voucher for a free personal pan pizza at participating branches of Pizza Hut. This neat bonus is, of course, a throwback to the release of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2: The Arcade Game on NES, which also included a free pizza with each purchase!\nhttps://twitter.com/LimitedRunGames/status/1533910176637517827?s=20&t=1OyPR7h4FbGbLewoOupIfg\nIt seems like Limited Run really had to pull some strings and do some serious organizing in order to get the pizza tie-in promotion on board, and as such, the offer is only redeemable at North American outlets and is tied exclusively to the Limited Run edition of TMNT: Shredder's Revenge. Still, it's a very cute, unique, and nostalgic freebie, especially for those who can actually eat pizza, unlike your feather-stomached boy Moyse. Regardless, pre-orders are now live on the Limited Run Games store.\nWhile no images were shown, Limited Run also has a full Collector's Edition of the cartoon brawler in the works, which will include all of the above gubbins along with a Playmates figure of Shredder himself, replicated from the megaselling 1990s toy line. More details on this edition will be revealed in the near future.\nTMNT: Shredder's Revenge launches 2022 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Limited Run Games’ TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge comes with a free pizza appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Something to look forward to\nE3 was already struggling before the pandemic hit, so its gradual departure over the past few years seemed to be a long time coming. While it may not have taken anyone by surprise, it was still pretty sad to see an event that had become such a staple of the gaming industry close its doors indefinitely. We've had plenty of other news streams to keep us busy, but it just hasn't quite been the same. So naturally, we're pretty excited to hear from the Entertainment Software Association (the organization that runs E3) that the event will be back fully in person in 2023 after three years, as they told The Washington Post.\nAs ESA president and CEO Stan Pierre-Louis told the site: \"We’re excited about coming back in 2023 with both a digital and an in-person event. As much as we love these digital events, and as much as they reach people and we want that global reach, we also know that there’s a really strong desire for people to convene—to be able to connect in person and see each other and talk about what makes games great.\"\n\nE3 had already been in a transition period before the pandemic hit — the event had been struggling with attendance and its own identity for years. They were making big changes, like allowing fans to attend what was previously a trade-only event in 2015, but even that wasn't enough to keep them afloat with many of the large companies opting for their own solo press conferences.\nWhile it can be a lot of fun to have one huge event to look forward to every year, some have considered the benefits of sunsetting E3 for good, like more games being able to stand out when the press is paced more evenly throughout the year, rather than being dumped on us all at once.\nAs an LA local, I'd love to be able to go in person again for E3 2023, but I know for others it's not that simple. I guess now it's just a waiting game to see if the ESA actually pulls through on this one.\nThe post The ESA says that E3 will definitely be back in person next year appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Super Crash Bros.\nIn the week of summer streamin', one can always expect a flurry of leaks and rumors, and 2022 is no exception. Regarding everyone's favorite crate-smashing psycho, Crash Bandicoot, the word on the street is that publisher Activision and developer Toys for Bob are preparing to reveal a brand new brawler/platform fighter starring Crash and The Boys... umm...\nThe rumor was sparked by Window Central writer (and known spoiler) Jez Corden, speaking on a new episode of the Windows Central Gaming Podcast. According to Corden, Toys for Bob is beavering away at the new title, which is expected to be a chaotic platform fighter in the style of games such as MultiVersus, Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, and, of course, Nintendo's Super Smash Bros. While the conversation on the podcast was a little spirited and jokey, there was a clear inference that the title could be revealed during this week's run of \"non-E3\" live streams.\nCrash Bandicoot, as a franchise, has certainly gotten to the point where it has enough beloved characters to launch its own fighting game. And given that it has already run the gamut of kart racers, puzzle titles, and mobile spin-offs, it seems that stepping it the ring is one of the few genres left for Crash, Coco, Cortex, and co. are left to conquer. I have already decided that Ripper Roo is my main, and we don't even know if he is in the Crash Bandicoot brawler... or even if there is a Crash Bandicoot brawler! I guess we'll just have to keep 'em peeled as the week progresses.\nYou can check out the full episode of the Windows Central Gaming Podcast below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwpO_G7OYW8\nThe post Rumor: Smash Bros.-like Crash Bandicoot brawler in the works appeared first on Destructoid.",

Electronic Arts and DICE debuted a trailer today, showing what's coming in Battlefield 2042 Season 1 on June 9, 2022.\nIn today's trailer, the team gives us a good look at Exposure, the new map arriving in Season 1. It's set in the Canadian Rockies and looks to make big use of verticality, allowing aircraft and wingsuits to really get around.\nAlso shown is the new Specialist, Ewelina Lis. Lis is particularly skilled at tackling vehicles, using a remote-controlled rocket launcher to wreak havoc on armor.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Hfeb7eIzbo\nAlongside those, new vehicles and weapons are also coming in Battlefield 2042 Season 1. Two new gunships, the RAH-68 Huron and YG-99 Hannibal, take to the skies. The BSV-M Marksman Rifle offers a new mid-range option. And the Smoke Grenade launcher offers some infantry ground cover.\nBut good lord, the Ghostmaker R10 Crossbow looks like a blast. Literally, because it has explosive ammo, alongside regular, light, and heavy ammo. The core content additions are available as part of the free Battle Pass track, though it will require playing to unlock. Additional cosmetics are in the Premium Battle Pass Track.\nSeasoned veterans\nThere are also more fixes for stability, balance, gunplay, performance, and more. It looks like DICE is trying to make good on its commitment to improving Battlefield 2042 after its rough launch.\nThe focus comes at the cost of some initial pillars, like the removal of the 128-player Breakthrough variant. The team also shuttered all future content development for Hazard Zone, its Tarkov-style multiplayer mode, in favor of focusing on its other pillars.\nWith Season 1 for Battlefield 2042 finally going live, it seems like this could be the time for DICE to rally and try to right the ship.

The video provides looks at how players will traverse and survive the red planet, as well as the launch date they’ll get to do so.\nDeliver Us Mars is coming on September 27. The space-faring adventure stars Kathy Johanson, an astronaut who enlists on a mission to Mars to locate stolen colonization vessels in search of a way to restore a dying Earth. She’s also chasing a mysterious signal that may be linked to her long-lost father. \n\n\nLike the first game, players will split time between solving environmental puzzles as well as platforming. The video shows Kathy scaling cliffs and other structures with her climbing ax, and the game also features scuba diving and zero gravity exploration. In addition to trekking across Mars’ dusty terrain, players will explore icy landscapes as well as interiors of ruined vessels and abandoned colonies. \nDeliver Us Mars will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC for $29.99.

          "description": "After a teaser trailer last year, DC and Warner Bros. Pictures have finally released an official trailer for its Black Adam movie starring Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson.\nFeaturing arguably one of the brightest color palettes in all of the DCEU, this trailer provides some backstory to the anti-hero that is Black Adam before showcasing the strength of this character. And that strength is enough to seemingly rival Superman as Black Adam doesn’t so much as break a sweat when up against baddies, missiles, crowbars, and more. Check it out for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, this trailer explains how Black Adam came to be. Nearly 5000 years ago, some bad people enslaved the man who would become Black Adam. Those same people then killed him, but somehow, his son sacrificed his life to help his father become Black Adam – an ancient god bestowed with mighty powers. However, just as quickly as he gained those powers, he was imprisoned. The trailer reveals that in the modern-day, he is somehow freed from the tomb and ready to “unleash his unique form of justice on the modern world.” \nThat unique form of justice will likely put him up against or on the paths of Aldis Hodge’s Hawkman, Noah Centineo’s Atom Smasher, Sarah Shahi’s Adrianna, Marwan Kenzari’s Ishmael, Quintessa Swindell’s Cyclone, Bodhi Sabongui’s Amon, and Pierce Brosnan’s Dr. Fate. The director of Jungle Cruise, which also starred Johnson, Jaume Collet-Serra, is the director behind Black Adam. \nDC’s Black Adam hits theaters internationally on Oct. 19. It hits U.S. theaters two days later, on Oct. 21. For more, watch this teaser trailer from last year. \nWhat do you think of this trailer? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "There are a few PlayStation studios that we haven't heard much from in a while, one of which is the Days Gone developers Bend Studio. That changes today with a blog post detailing the history of Bend Studio and giving a tiny hint at what the team is up to with its next project.\nThe post details the games Bend had developed in its nearly 30-year history, from the first days of the studio when it was known as Blank, Berlyn and Co., through the time it was known as Eidetic when it developed Bubsy 3D, the Syphon Filter series, and beyond. There's a lot of great history about the studio packed in there alongside concept art and more. But, what comes next for Bend Studio is a break from any series or franchise it's worked on or created before. \n\"We are currently working on a new IP that includes multiplayer and builds upon the open-world systems of Days Gone, but brings you a whole new world that we are extremely excited to craft for you. We cannot wait to reveal it to you when the time is right,\" writes Kevin McAllister from Bend Studio.\nThis is the second time Bend has mentioned its new project, with the first word coming from a tweet last year. While the next game from the studio won't be Days Gone 2, nor a return to Syphon Filter, it at least looks to be learning and building from those prior works. Additionally, whether this new IP will be part of Sony's new initiative to develop more live service games remains to be seen.\nBend Studio also took the opportunity to debut a new logo in the blog post, which you can see above. The logo treatment is a nice change in design from the previous iterations since it's now modular and can be fitted into different aesthetics for various occasions.\nFor more on Bend Studio's former projects or what never came to be, check out what the studio pitched for a sequel to Days Gone that never saw the light of day.",

The emerald green superhero is joined by former Diva Stacey Keibler, NXT UK’s A-Kid, and former NXT Tag Team Champion Wes Lee. \n\n\nLike past DLC wrestlers, each new face comes with MyFaction EVO cards, including a Booker T and Sapphire Seth Rollins. The Stand Back pack costs $9.99 on its own and is part of the $39.99 Season Pass (included in the Deluxe and nWo 4-Life editions). \nPer the game’s roadmap, the next, and penultimate, content pack arrives on June 28. To learn more about WWE 2K22, check out our review.",

          "description": "A massive 1.0 update for Battlefield 2042 is out now on all platforms, and it brings hundreds of changes, bug fixes, and quality of life improvements to the online shooter ahead of its Season 1 launch. \nAnd speaking of Season 1: Zero Hour, DICE will reveal gameplay today at 8 a.m. PT/11 a.m. ET on its official Battlefield 2042 YouTube channel, as reported by VG247.

As for the update, here’s what Dice has highlighted: \nMultiple improvements to soldier gameplay which will result in overall smoother animations and movement.\nWeapons received updated netcode to improve bullet hit registration. We’ve also done a further balance pass which includes increased projectile speeds for DMR’s and LMG’s, and improved accuracy for Shotguns.\nMultiple new XP events have been added, such as for killing an enemy who recently wounded or killed a squadmate, or when an enemy vehicle you recently damaged is destroyed by a teammate and the occupants are killed\nThe number of available in-world vehicles has been increased for Conquest which should make it easier to move across the map\nSundance’s Wingsuit has been adjusted to lower overall flight time, while making it easier to maneuver. To simplify their Specialty, the EMP Field Smart Explosive has been removed\nDice is scheduling the next update for early July, but it’s “a smaller update that brings further fixes and changes to the battlefield.” Head to Dice’s full patch notes list for the complete list of changes, bug fixes, and improvements. \nWhile waiting for today’s Season 1 debut, read Game Informer’s Battlefield 2042 review and read about how the next Battlefield has entered pre-production with “valuable lessons” learned from Battlefield 2042.

          "description": "Madden NFL 23 is coming in August with some new tech set to change the game entirely on both sides of the ball. Our own Brian Shea recently went hands-on with the latest version of Madden and its game-changing feature FieldSense, which encompasses a variety of changes to gameplay and animations. You can check out a deep dive into everything FieldSense offers in the video above.\nFieldSense, which is exclusive to the newest generation of consoles (PS5 and Xbox Series X/S), has a few different aspects that are covered in the video by senior game design director for Madden NFL 23, Connor Dougan. First is a set of new physics-informed animation as well as animation branching technology that brings a more realistic look to the action on the field. New gameplay techniques like 360 Cuts introduce more control for receivers and running backs, while Hit Everything is a feature that affects just about everything on the defensive side of the ball. For Quarterbacks, Skill Based Passing will let players fine-tune where they're throwing the ball for more precise passes that can be kept away from pass defenders. There are demonstrations of those new concepts and more in the almost five-minute breakdown.\nMadden NFL 23 lands on August 19 this year with the man himself, John Madden, gracing the cover. While FieldSense is only available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, other versions of the game are also coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

          "description": "Back at E3 2021, we learned that Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties, one of the strangest FMV games of the ’90s, was getting remastered for modern consoles courtesy of Limited Run Games. Now we know that John, Jane, and Thresher will return later this year. \nThe news comes by way of today's Limited Run Presents showcase. What the heck is Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties, you ask? The 1993 game is best described as an interactive romantic comedy firmly aimed at adults, thanks to its mild nudity and sexual innuendo. Players guide a plumber named John, who tries to win the heart of a beautiful woman named Jane in an adventure laden with ridiculous hijinks. That includes dealing with an unreliable narrator and confronting a, shall we say, creepy boss. The gameplay involves making simple decisions in a choose-your-own-adventure format and watching live-action cutscenes. \nTo editorialize a bit, Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties is absurd and pretty bad. However, as footage of the game found its way on YouTube over the years, the game has found new life as a cult favorite “so bad it’s good” oddity, not unlike Night Trap (which got a similar remaster a few years ago). Since Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties had a limited release on PC and the poor-selling 3DO console, not many folks have been able to play it themselves. \nThe Definitive Edition polishes up the adventure with 4K visuals and adds features such as deleted scenes, a progress chart, and new video interviews with the cast. \nPlumbers Don’t Wear Ties: Definitive Edition launches later this year for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. It will be available both digitally and in physical form, thanks to Limited Run Games. If you’re into FMV games, check out this deep-dive feature about the history of the genre.",

While we await more details on some of those features, Capcom has divulged some info on Ryu's new look and the game's place in the Street Fighter timeline.\nThe game's official Twitter account shared a statement by director Takayuki Nakayama that confirms Street Fighter 6 takes place after the events of Street Fighter III. This places the game at the end of the series' timeline given that Street Fighter V is set before SF 3. \nAs for Ryu's new look, Nakayama explains his Buddhist robe, also called a kasaya, showcases Ryu's newfound dignity despite the warrior feeling he's \"not there yet.\" What that means is up to interpretation, but the attire does pair well with Ryu's dashing beard if nothing else. \n\"Although Street Fighter 6 occurs after the Street Fighter III series, Ryu still feels that he's \"not there yet\" - though he seems to have gained some dignity. The way he wears the kasaya (Buddhist robe) is reminiscent of his master, Goken.\"\n@takaNakayama pic.twitter.com/yFdzRHsPVp\nJune 6, 2022\nStreet Fighter 6 launches sometime in 2023 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC.",

Now, Pokémon Go and the Pokémon Trading Card Game are crossing over with events that will touch both games. For Pokémon Go, the event begins on June 16 and brings the chance to catch Wimpod and a new version of Pikachu wearing a TCG hat.\nFor the Pokémon Trading Card Game, the next expansion is themed around Pokémon Go, and will feature cards based on Team Mystic, Instinct, and Valor. We'll have to wait to see just how many of the cards are true crossovers, but no matter what, it's great seeing these two popular games work together.\nFor the mobile trainers out there, Wimpod is one of those Pokémon that requires 400 candies to evolve. When this number is hit, Wimpod evolves into Golisopod. The creature that looks a bit like a dead fish transforms into one of the coolest Godzilla-like beasts in all of Pokémon.\nThis event also sees Mewtwo returning to five-star raids. All Mewtwo caught from June 16 to June 23 will have the Shadow Ball charged attack. Those caught from June 23 to July 1 will have the Psystrike charged attack.\nIf you use the Mystery Box during the event, you'll have the chance to catch a Shiny Meltan. The Mystery Box is only obtained by sending a Pokémon to Pokémon Home or Pokémon: Let’s Go, Pikachu! or Pokémon: Let’s Go, Eevee! It's a bit of a hassle to get the Box, but it's well worth it, as Meltan is great for battling.",

In the final moments of last night's event, we saw Obi-Wan Kenobi locked in combat with Darth Vader. The feared Sith Lord is one of the new skins that is unlockable when you purchase this season's battle pass. At a later date in the battle pass bonus tier, archaeologist Indiana Jones will join the fight.\nFortnite Chapter 3, Season 3 is officially called Vibin', and true to form, it brings a colorful, party atmosphere to its new story thread and areas of the map. On the eastern coast, you'll see two new areas to explore: Rave Cave and Reality Falls. These Biomes feature giant mushrooms to bound across, as well as waterfalls and strange trees to interact with.\nThe tallest tree is called the Reality Tree and it's in full bloom, spreading Reality Seed Pods across the island. If you grab a seed and plant it, a Reality Sapling will grow. If you weed it, you'll be rewarded loot. The more times a sapling is uprooted, the better the loot. Yes, you can get Mythic weapons this way.\nOn the gameplay front, you can now use animals as mounts. If you see a wolf or boar, see if you can catch a ride. Ballers are also back thanks to the reappearance of the Screwballer amusement park ride. The Ballers have more health than before, can float on water, and are battery-operated, meaning you know how long the ride will be.\nWe'll have to wait to see what other surprises and changes await us in Vibin', but it's off to a great start, and you gotta love seeing Indiana Jones and Darth Vader joining the character ranks.\nWhat did you think of the Collision event?

Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise. This week we start from the beginning as we unpack one of the most influential action games ever, Devil May Cry.\nArriving stateside on October 16, 2001, the game stars Dante, a demon hunter (and half-demon himself) on a mission to stop underworld emperor Mundus from invading the human world. The game began life as Resident Evil 4, helmed by a hotshot young director named Hideki Kamiya who veered the game from survival horror to stylish action. While it proved too drastic of a departure for Resident Evil, Capcom knew they had something and reworked the project into its own franchise. Listen on to learn how Dante was conceived, our thoughts on the game’s story, and how we fared against the game’s legendarily brutal difficulty.\nJoin hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), along with MinnMax contributer and former Game Informer editor Joe Juba (@Joejuba) \nIf you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

          "description": "Amazon Games has partnered with Disruptive Games, the studio behind Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 and Diablo II: Resurrected, to create a new intellectual property that will release on a variety of machines. Described by Amazon Games as an online multiplayer action-adventure with cooperative and competitive play, this new experience appears to be set in a post-apocalytpic or post-war world. This observation comes from two pieces of concept art that show crashed airplanes that appear to be heavily weathered.\nThe humans pictured in these artworks hold primitive weapons, such as a rifle with a bayonet. One of the characters appears to have mechanical legs. Several of these beings also wear headsets with tall antenna, likely for cooperative communication.\nIn a press release, Christoph Hartmann, the vice president of Amazon Games, says we can expect something different from this multiplayer experience. \"The talented team at Disruptive Games is creating a fresh take on the multiplayer action-adventure genre, with strong game design and rich world-building that we're excited to help bring to players.\" \nOn Disruptive's official website, this new IP is amusingly codenamed \"super secret project.\" We'll have to wait for more details, but the usage of concept art with game title implies it's a long way off.",

On June 4, players are invited to experience a timed event called \"Collision.\" This story-driven moment can only be played once and will kick off at 4 p.m. ET. Epic Games says the fate of the Zero point will be decided in this gameplay event, which I believe will lead into Chapter 3, Season 3.\nThe events in Fortnite are always fun, as they shake up the gameplay, change the environments, and introduce new characters to the battle royale universe. Collision hits just a week after Obi-Wan Kenobi is introduced. A mysterious tower has also appeared in the center of the island.\nEpic Games is encouraging streamers and players to record the event, as it won't be repeated. The last event brought us The Foundation (played by Dwayne Johnson) and Spider-Man. The island also flipped over and gave us an entirely new map to discover. What will happen this time? The teaser image above gives us a taste of a monstrous return.\nIf you have the Battle Pass, you have just one week to complete it and get Doctor Strange (and his alternate costumes in the bonus tier). Fly through the missions you can for big XP bumps.\nIf you log in at any point on June 4 after 8 a.m. ET, you'll receive an exclusive loading screen and lobby track for Collision. You'll be able to log into the Collision lobby 30 minutes before the event begins.\nWhat do you hope to see from Season 3? Any character skins you are hoping to see added or return?",

The Resident Evil 2 and 3 Remakes have been a perfect way to relive the glories of the past with contemporary improvements. But what comes next? Resident Evil 4 Remake is the answer, and we're pouring over every detail of the new trailer in today's spoiler-filled breakdown.\n\n\nAlex Stadnik is your host for the video and welcomes Resident Evil 4 superfan Blake Hester to dissect every nook and cranny of Capcom's surprise announcement from the latest Sony State of Play. As stated above, we go into a lot of spoilers of the original game, so if you haven't played it yet, please bookmark this video and come back.\nThe boys kick things off by discussing their levels of surprise when the fourth entry in the iconic series makes its first appearance. They then break the trailer down scene by scene, letting you know what they think will be different and what will stay the same. They also ponder if the remake will feature a character similar to Mr. X, Nemesis, or Lady D instead of creating a straight one-to-one recreation. Finally, they wrap by discussing whether or not the game will get delayed and what their levels of hype are after seeing Leon's return.\nAre you excited about Resident Evil 4? The wait isn't too long as Capcom's next remake is launching on March 24, 2023, for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC!

          "description": "Sega revealed a quick 30-second teaser of Sonic Frontiers gameplay earlier this week, and IGN released a full seven-minute look at the open-world gameplay of the Blue Blur’s latest. Now, you can watch more than six minutes of combat from the game, and it looks like Sonic combat…in a 3D open world. \nAs we previously saw, Sonic Frontiers’ world is beautiful and one of the most realistic-looking games in the franchise’s history. Today’s combat showcase takes place in the same area as the previous gameplay premiere but with decidedly less rail grinding and more spinball fighting action. As you might expect, Sonic fights in Sonic Frontiers like he always has – lots of jump attacks, spin moves, kicks, and more. However, it seems he does have a few new tricks up his sleeve. Namely, an in-air jolt attack that makes him dash all over the screen before doing an interesting rotating circle attack. Take a look for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Sonic is up against some new types of enemies in Sonic Frontiers, and they seem to tank a lot more damage than the Blue Blur is traditionally used to doling out. That doesn’t appear to be a problem for him, though, as he aptly takes them out with ease. We also get a look at Sonic confronting a massive creature-like machine that stands extremely tall toward the end of the video. Sonic uses some interesting moves to eventually defeat that, too. \nUnfortunately, we don’t yet have a release date for Sonic Frontiers, but it’s coming sometime this year, so hopefully, we don’t have to wait too much longer. In the meantime, check out this trailer from last December, and then check out this other snippet of Sonic Frontiers gameplay that debuted earlier this week. \nWhat do you think of the combat in Sonic Frontiers?

It turns out Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is actually coming to PC this year, too, according to a PlayStation Blog Post spotted by IGN. However, while Spider-Man Remastered will be released on PC this summer, the PlayStation blog says Miles Morales will “launch on PC in fall 2022,” so presumably later than August 12. \nOddly enough, PlayStation didn’t reveal Miles Morales was coming to PC during yesterday’s showcase, an odd exclusion for a segment of the show that was all about Spider-Man’s big PC release. Nonetheless, you can play through both of Insomniac’s Spider-Man games on PC later this year.  \nThe original story continues below...\nOriginal story, 6/2/22:\nHave you been wanting to web-sling as Spidey on your PC? You’re in luck! Today, at Sony’s State of Play, it was announced that Insomniac’s Spider-Man is coming to PC in its remastered form on August 12. Previously, you could only play the game on PS4 and PS5. \nThe remastered edition includes new assets, tech, and plenty of updates. In this edition, Peter Parker was recast to Ben Jordan to better match actor Yuri Lowenthal’s facial capture for PS5.\nThat’s right in just a few months, you’ll be able to experience the game that our own Andrew Reiner gave a 9.5, saying: “Like Batman: Arkham Asylum before it, Spider-Man raises the bar for one of the world’s most beloved heroes.” You can read his full review here.\nWant more? You can watch the reveal trailer above, which showcases the announcement and all the awesome action in store for Peter Parker.",

Following that trailer, Square Enix has uploaded some new screenshots of the beautiful landscapes in FF XVI we’ll be trekking across, and they look fantastic. Check them out for yourself below: \n\nAs you can see, they feature new looks at different parts of this world that we haven’t yet seen in trailers, which have focused more on the story and combat of the game than the actual setting.

          "description": "We haven't seen the jaw-dropping, peaceful-seeming indie since last year. Just a few months after its debut at The Game Awards, the title seemed to be stalled after several hostile workplace allegations. However, today's State of Play proved the game is still in development and aims to come out in Autumn. The unexpected release window is coming up quickly, but the gorgeous new trailer suggests Season: A Letter to the Future will be ready.\n\n\nSeason won't task you with fighting monsters or saving the world. Rather, the game puts the player in the shoes of a traveler named Estelle, who is recording everything around her for posterity. There are hints that Season's sweeping vistas, sun-drenched fields, and flowing waterfalls won't be around for future generations. The trailer explains that no one knows what will happen when \"the season\" ends, which makes the job of documenting the world for the future so important. We see the protagonist going about this assignment is various ways, like writing in a journal, taking photos, and recording audio. She also stops off to speak with the people around her while exploring the landscape on her bike.\nAs the narrative designer, Meg Hutchison explains:\nThe title looks like it is shaping up to be a pensive and beautiful experience when it comes out on PlayStation consoles and PC this fall.",

In it, independent developer Studio Sai invites you to find love in the most trying times – during an apocalypse.  \nThe game challenges you to make the most of life during this catastrophic situation. That means finding life and saving the world. When a mysterious entity infects humans and turns them into monsters, you must race against the clock to find an answer for survival, especially if you want to save your new relationship. In the game, you scavenge, dungeon crawl, and date your way to answers. But be aware that you're doing it all on a deadline, with a clock constantly ticking, reminding you to meet your deadlines.\nStudio Sai promises dungeons with traps and puzzles, alongside fun dancing minigames. You also get to pick from a cast of five characters for your romantic pursuits, each with their own unique stories and skills to help you battle. The action showcased in the trailer looked fast-paced and featured mostly hacking and slashing away at baddies while using the face buttons to unleash powerful skills and magical abilities. There was even a motorcycle sequence to get your adrenaline pumping. You can watch the trailer above to see it all in action for yourself. \nSo get ready to hold hands, makeout, and fight to stay alive when Eternights debuts on PS5, PS4, and PC sometime in early 2023.",

A new bloodsport called rollerdrome will apparently become all the rage in that year. Rollerdrome is in development at Roll7, the studio behind the OlliOlli series, and will be published by Private Division on August 16 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC.\nAnyone can compete in this deadly game, but the deck is stacked against them, as they take on house players (much like the American Gladiators show). The goal of each competitor is to achieve the highest score possible, by combining rollerskate tricks with eliminations. The player assumes the identity of Kara Hassan as she enters her first match. Your goal is to rise the ranks and hopefully become the Rollerdome champion – meaning you stay alive.\n“It’s been amazing to see this project come to life from the original prototype that received a lot of love online, all the way to the brutal and intense experience it is now – thanks to the amazing work of the team at Roll7,″ Paul Rabbitte, creative director at Roll7, said. “We’re really excited for players to jump into Rollerdrome.”",

As for the trailer, it showcased more of the behind-the-cat, third-person (err, third-feline?) gameplay central to the game. As previously seen, this stray cat inhabits a very cyberpunk-esque world, filled with robots and more. As for the titular stray cat's place in all this, it seems they're on a mission to help inhabitants of this world and ultimately, find a way home. \nYou can watch the trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nHere's what publisher Annapurna Interactive has to say about Stray: \"In Stray, players take the role of a stray cat who must untangle an ancient mystery to escape a long-forgotten cybercity amidst the detailed neon-lit alleys and the murky environments of its seedy underbelly. Along the way, the cat befriends a small flying drone, known only as B12. With the help of this newfound companion, the duo must find a way out.\" \nFor more about the game, watch the original Stray reveal trailer. \nAre you excited about Stray?

The game got a new trailer at today’s presentation, along with a December 2 launch date.\nFor those not in the know, Striking Distance Studios is led by Glen Schofield, the same person who helped lead development of the original Dead Space way back in 2008. Even as EA is actively working on a remake of that original game, Schofield’s team is charting out a new universe of horror that is clearly inspired by the gameplay and visual palette of that older game.\nIn the new trailer, we get an extensive glimpse at the gory and terrifying gameplay in store for players when the game launches later this year. We see protagonist Jacob Lee as he makes his way through one scary-looking outer space locale to the next, often with the looming presence of the gas giant planet of Jupiter overhead.  \nJacob wanders through tight and dimly lit corridors before an array of monsters manage to get to him. We see an interesting mix of melee and ranged weapons that the scared hero can wield. But even with some helpful toys, things don't always go well for Jacob. Striking Distance is pulling no punches in regard to what happens to their lead character if players don’t manage to pull him out of trouble. In one especially disturbing concluding sequence, we see one of the creatures tear a portion of his head and face off in what is almost certainly a preface to a game over screen.\nThe Callisto Protocol just happens to be this month’s cover story at Game Informer, and you can head over to our game hub to check out all the info we’ve got on the game as it becomes available.\nIn the meantime, check out the trailer in all its creepy glory, and watch for The Callisto Protocol's release on December 2 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

          "description": "Sony opened Thursday's State of Play livestream by announcing the long-rumored, often-leaked Resident Evil 4 Remake. While the brief trailer didn't show much in the way of gameplay, it did show various locations and characters from the game, and most importantly, a release date: March 24, 2023.\nMost strikingly – and predictably – the new Resident Evil 4 looks leagues better visually than its 2005 counterpart. During the minute-long trailer, we see protagonist Leon Kennedy, antihero Ada Wong, Ashley Graham, Luis, and brief glimpses of antagonists Osmund Saddler and Bitores Mendez. The trailer also shows quick looks at Salazar Castle and the iconic village from the beginning of RE4 and the baddies that inhabit them. The voiceover seems to indicate the game's story has been expanded and will act as a more direct sequel to Resident Evil 2, which also stars Leon as its protagonist. \nThe trailer ends with a brief tease that VR content is also in development for Resident Evil 4. \nSee the trailer in full below.\n\n\nThis is just the latest in the long line of Resident Evil remakes – which, if you're being exact, starts all the way back on the GameCube with the remake of the original 1996 game. In 2019, developer-publisher Capcom released a remake of Resident Evil 2, which was then followed by a Resident Evil 3: Nemesis remake in 2020. And if you're being technical, this is actually the second Resident Evil 4 remake in as many years – kind of. Last year, Capcom partnered with developer Armature Studios on the excellent Resident Evil 4 VR.",

If they find a new gear set they prefer, they can take on all the stats of it while keeping the look of their favorite set thanks to transmog. \n\n\nElsewhere, this update allows players to completely reset their skills and redistribute skill points. That's going to be especially helpful for players who need to reshape their build in a new difficulty now live in Horizon Forbidden West: Ultra Hard difficulty. \nGuerrilla Games has been hard at work fixing visual problems with the game through multiple patches, such as shimmering in foliage and elsewhere, and today's update includes \"improved visual fidelity.\" There's no word on exactly what that addresses but it's probably safe to say the game will look better after installing the update.

However, it did reveal some of the game's big narrative plot points. The trailer, which you can watch below, was also filled with lush environments and showed off several impressive, first-person shots of the world's monstrous machines.\n\n\nYou'll be playing as Ryas, an entirely new character, who was once a Shadow Carja. He finds himself mysteriously released from prison by Blameless Marad, the Sun King's right-hand man, to combat a deadly threat.

The wild rapids look like they'll be an experience in the PSVR2 game's campaign, but players can check out even more rushing waters in the Call of the Mountain River Ride. This bonus feature offers to show you Horizon's world in a totally new way. \nA post on PlayStation's blog offered more insight for players who are ready to jump into the Ryas' story, saying:\nBut that's not the only Horizon news from today's event.

His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh's main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.\nMichael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.\nEmanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.\nAvijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet's task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.\nThe team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.\nPlease give a warm welcome to our new students! Let's make GSoC 2022 a huge success – together!\n>",
