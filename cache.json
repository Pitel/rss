Like a herd of frigates scenting a pride of destroyers lurking behind a nearby asteroid, I rerouted hastily and took up a holding position approximately one astronomical unit from the Buy button, hoping that the developers might iron out a few of the wrinkles. \n Read more",

But I'm also the ideal reviewer to tear it apart over the most minor hiccups and defects. I'm the Anton Ego of factory games. I don't like food, I love it. If I don't love it, I don't swallow.\nAh, you needn't worry. This is by far the most fun I've had reviewing a game, and Shapez 2 has, in my mind at least, turned the holy trinity of factory games (Factorio, Satisfactory, Dyson Sphere Program) into a holy quartet. Its pared back, everything-is-free-forever approach is quite liberating, and I've never had so much fun placing conveyor belts in my life. But 40 hours into my save file, I've often found myself yearning for a bit more creativity in the challenges, a few more curveballs sent in my direction.\n Read more",

Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s October 31st release date leaked earlier, Steam have put together a Summer Fright Night bundle featuring RPS fave Hauntii, and I’ve got a strange urge to gorge on Haribo and mini Double Deckers until blood comes out of my eyeballs. What a perfect time, then, to dive into the alpha demo for vampire management game Blood Bar Tycoon, especially since Two Point seem to be resting on their laurels a bit too comfortably for my liking.\nThe idea here is you build a swanky bar serving claret cosmopolitans, ichor-ish coffees and uh, viscera vampiros to your undead clientele. But (with the sorta exception of the crimson-sapped Dracaena cinnabari) blood doesn’t grow on trees, so you’ll also be moonlighting as a human-nabber. You’ll research a slew of “whacky contraptions” to extract their blood, which I greatly enjoy, because “zany exsanguination” is a real winner of a feature. You can’t frivolously phlebotomise with impunity, however - you’ll also want to be on the lookout for vampire hunters aka the fun police.\n \nRead more",

Still, a clutch of disgruntled ‘divers have recently found a novel way to protest an increasingly unpopular series of nerfs: laying down their guns and letting the bots take the damn planet.\n“If Super Earth wanted to remain safe, they would stop nerfing our guns,\" reads one comment on the subreddit, in response to a post titled “Let the bots advance. Let the Super Earth burn.” It seems to have picked up some steam inside the actual game, too. As of earlier this week, there’s only around a thousand players actively trying to stop the bots advancing perilously close to the home planet, via Gamesradar.\nWhether this is all massively overblown for the sake of a dramatic yarn or not, Arrowhead themselves have taken note of player concerns over nerfs. Yesterday, game director Mikael Eriksson unveiled a plan for the next 60 days, directly addressing player feedback over the controversial ‘Escalation of Freedom’ update.\n \nRead more",

The Deck’s compatibility issues aren’t nearly as issue-some as they were at launch, but between its Linux-based SteamOS and its relatively mild processing power, but it is true that beefier Windows handhelds will more likely cater to your entire cross-launcher library.\nUnless, that is, you get something else to run them for you. Streaming games on the Steam Deck has emerged as a nifty workaround for the portable PC’s lingering compatibility woes, making even officially unsupported games playable. Usually with much better performance, too, as the actual rendering work is done remotely – what you see on the Deck’s screen is basically a video feed of that remote device’s display output, with your control input beamed the other way via a low-latency connection. And because you’re not using SteamOS or the internal hardware to actually run the game, it’s not bound by their limits.\nRead more",

          "description": "Among the many, Gigery beauties of 2014's Alien: Isolation is that you save using an in-game, wall-mounted Emergency Phone - a maddeningly analog process of slotting a keycard into the machine and waiting for three beeps. Doing this requires you to stand upright in full view, with your back turned upon an entire space station's worth of shiny domed technology and guttural industrial noises. Delightful!\nAmongst the players harrowed and compelled by this fixture is Fede Álvarez, director of the 2013 Evil Dead remake, 2016's Don't Breathe and, most recently Alien: Romulus - the seventh and avowedly \"back to basics\" Alien movie. Isolation is the Alien experience that convinced Álvarez the Alien could still be scary, after decades of milking the creature's dugs for spin-off movies and making it share a screen with the Predator, the Pepsi Max to Alien's Dom Pérignon 1921. In possibly self-defeating homage to Creative Assembly's work, he's filled the movie with Emergency Telephones, turning them into a straightforward-sounding form of foreshadowing.\n Read more",

Saber and Focus Home have released an extended trailer that walks you through two major modes - the PvE boss and wave-slaying frenzy of Operations, and the 12-player PvP carnage of Eternal War, which spans a range of match types.

In that time, many other survival games have sprouted, blossomed, and gently faded away. I first visited the burnt-out ruins of this zombie-infested world a decade ago and I returned to it this week to find a tree-puncher that, despite bearing the pockmarks of early access, retains much of what made it enjoyable back when the survival genre was still wearing its baby onesie. Instead of a review, I figured I'd scribble together a mini starter guide for new (or returning) players. Partly because the game is a proper time sink and it was taking me so long to get through everything. But mostly because I wanted to use that numberful headline.

This is not the murmuring of some poor sod on a nineteen-hour Dota 2 binge who’s started thinking that the crumbs in his keyboard resemble a viable snack, but a bold new reality, one I recently found myself staring down during a trip to Asda. The supermarket chain – third biggest in the UK by turnover and purveyors of ill-fitting clothes and surprisingly good doughnuts alike – has added light-up gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets to its mountain of own-brand wares.\nAsda being what it is (Americans, if you’re unfamiliar, think Walmart with less gun violence), it’s all dirt cheap as well. £17 for a full-size keyboard. £16 for an FPS mouse. Overwhelmed with curiosity, I ended up taking home a complete starter set (keeb, different mouse, headset, and mousemat) for £45, or about a third of the price of the Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL that I’d shortly kick off my desk. Could this be a new frontier in affordable PC hardware, bringing tech to the masses in a way no specialist retailer ever could, or should supermarkets stick to cereal and meal deals? Surely the Asda Tech (real name) 4-in-1 Gaming Kit would have the answers.\nRead more",

          "description": "Is early adoption a chump’s game? I dunno about that, though between the Asus ROG Ally X and the Steam Deck OLED, those who stayed their hand on their earlier handheld gaming PC counterparts do have a couple of quality second-genners to choose from. Valve’s effort manages to wring multiple performance, design, and battery life improvements out of its new display, while the ROG Ally X makes similar upgrades with a bigger-yet-better take on the original ROG Ally.\nThe only thing to do, clearly, is make them fight. It’s probably in the Irish Code Duello or something: \"Should one portable games box impugn another’s honour by releasing shortly after it, satisfaction must be claimed through a comparison article.\" My hands are bound here, folks, though if you yourself have been playing the waiting game on a handheld purchase, perhaps this little head-to-head can help you pick the right one.\nRead more",

          "description": "Cinematic platformer Bionic Bay opens on a scene of a very large egg doing very bad things - easily my third favourite genre of speculative fiction. You awake to a world of tree trunks that twist like viscera and corroded contraptions powered by luminous goop that’s stored in the balls, uh, big glass orbs. A beam of light soon fills your character with newfound vigour, which is a nice moment of triumph in what otherwise feels like a deeply oppressive rust pit, all unsteady platforms and jagged pipes.\nIt doesn’t take long before you start spotting examples of the reason Bionic Bay went viral earlier this week. Above your head hangs a painstakingly detailed mass of vents and cables, looming lifelike with dust and shadow and history. I stood and stared because I’d seen how the sausage was made, but I like to think I would have lingered longer than usual anyway. It really is just that impressive.\nRead more",

So if there's only one person in your village who knows how to brew tastier beer, and they die after being freakishly savaged by a passing wolf (it happens), suddenly your village will have no artisanal lager master. The results may be devastating. Luckily, you can share knowledge in a number of ways - by copying books, or having \"wise conversations\". The exception to this is child characters, whose pea-sized brains can't learn specialist knowledge, only soaking up basic attributes like \"manners\" from the teachers you assign to them. Well, until now. The developers for the Rimworld-meets-Crusader Kings catastrophe simulator have made kids a little smarter. They'll now learn more important things from their adult teachers.\nRead more",

No colons, no bespoke jargon, no tortuous subtitles like \"Gaia's B.O.U.N.T.Y.\" or \"Hyperion's Wild Rumpus\" - just the steadying prospect of a titanic quest that, who knows, may involve actual titans. The action-RPG beneath the moniker appears similarly straightforward: it's about following a plot thread through a mythological world in top-down view, smashing Ancient Greek giga-crabs and the like to obtain shinier, pointier varieties of gear. I'm sure I don't need to tell you that there's an endgame in which you farm monsters for crafting materials.\r\n\n\r\nLike Pandora opening her box, but without the accompanying tidal wave of sickness, curses and death, THQ Nordic have released a new trailer that talks you though all of this in detail. Here it is...\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The first World Of Goo was a cheerful parade of goopy engineering with a sense of never-ending novelty (well, never-ending for about four hours). Every level would introduce a new goo type or a twist on the basic bridge-building puzzle that challenged you to get a gaggle of gurgling balls to the nearest pipe. World Of Goo 2 pursues that sense of novelty with just as much twitchy eagerness as its predecessor, throwing new toys and goos at the player in an effort to keep you on your sludge-coated toes. That pursuit doesn't always result in pleasing new levels, though. There is a \"hit and miss\" feeling to things this time around. But those hits are hits. For anyone who has spent the last 16 years yearning for more sticky structure-building: I hope you like comically unpredictable fluids.\nRead more",

          "description": "Each week in Destiny 2 brings a new Nightfall mission and a weapon to grind the god roll for. This is the go-to for most endgame players as you get access to some very strong Adept weapons sporting some fantastic perks.\n\n\nOne such weapon has a unique god roll thanks to its archetype, and it only comes around ever so often. Here's the god roll for the Undercurrent grenade launcher in Destiny 2.\n\n\nThe best perks and attachments for the Undercurrent in Destiny 2\n\n\nImage via Destructoid.\n\n\nThe Undercurrent is part of the Wave Frame archetype of grenade launchers, which means the grenades it shoots send out a wave when they hit the ground. This damages all enemies in a line and makes the weapon great for ad clear. However, this also means the iconic build of running Disorienting Grenades, Auto-Loading Holster, and Vorpal Weapon doesn't work. However, the following build does nicely:\n\n\n\nLauncher Barrel: Quick Launch\n\n\nMagazine: High-Velocity Rounds\n\n\nPerk 1: Demolitionist\n\n\nPerk 2: Voltshot\n\n\n\nQuick Launch lets you get that shot out from the Undercurrent much faster, giving better weapon ready speed and projectile speed for a good combination. High-Velocity Rounds expands on that, giving you an even faster reload and projectile speed for follow-up shots. Demolitionist makes for a great flow between regenerating your grenade charge, throwing it out, and then repeating the process with a reloaded grenade launcher. Finally, there's Voltshot, which seriously improves the ad clear potential through jolt.\n\n\nIf running this with a grenade build isn't your forte, then Ambitious Assassin is a great alternative perk, provided you can get several kills with one grenade. You could also run Lead from Gold to seriously improve your ammo economy.\n\nThe post Destiny 2 Undercurrent god roll – Best perks and attachments appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Paradox Interactive announced today that the new Stellaris: Cosmic Storms expansion for the sci-fi strategy game is set to launch via PC on September 10, 2024. The new expansion brings new technologies and edicts to respond to the new Cosmic Storm threat as well as the all-new Storm Chaser origin and two new precursor stories.\n\n\n\n\nWhile storm systems already exist in Stellaris, the new Cosmic Storms expansion adds 8 new types of Cosmic Storms that replace the existing Space Storms and randomly spawn across the map. The new Cosmic Storms are Electric, Particle, Gravity, Magnetic, Radiant, Stardust, Shroud, and Nexus. The storms will automatically grow, shrink, and change speeds as they work their way across the galaxy.\n\n\nAlongside the storms is the new Storm Chaser Origin, an empire of people that seek to push themselves beyond their own limits. As such, they strive for enlightenment by engaging with the new fierce Cosmic Storms that the universe sends at them.\n\n\nWith the new Storm Chaser Origin comes three new civics: Astrometeorology, Storm Devotion, and Environmental Architects. There are also two new precursor stories that discover the stories of the Ancients, vanished masters of the storms: Weather Manipulators and the adAkkaris Convention of Benevolence. Completing each narrative will unlock a new relic.\n\n\nStellaris: Cosmic Storms will be released on PC via Steam on September 10, 2024, at the price point of $12.99. It's part of the Season 8 Season Pass and will also be added to the monthly Expansion Subscription for Stellaris.\n\nThe post New Stellaris expansion Cosmic Storms sweeps across the galaxy in September appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Destiny 2's Salvation's Edge raid weapons are all rather unique, if not in function then definitely in appearance. Each one is about as weird as the visuals of the raid itself, not that this makes them any less powerful.\n\n\nAmong them is a new sword that, while not including Eager's Edge, has a rather potent DPS combo for certain boss fights: The Summum Bonum.\n\n\nHere's the god roll for the Summum Bonum sword in Destiny 2.\n\n\nThe best perks and attachments for the Summum Bonum in Destiny 2\n\n\nImage via Destructoid.\n\n\nThe Summum Bonum sword sports the highly sought-after Wave Frame archetype, allowing its heavy attacks to send out a wave in front of you. This gives your sword a little range if you either get pushed back or are still approaching the enemy. The following perks and attachments should pair nicely with it:\n\n\n\nBlade: Hungry Edge\n\n\nGuard: Balanced Guard\n\n\nPerk 1: Relentless Strikes\n\n\nPerk 2: Chaos Reshaped\n\n\n\nHungry Edge immediately provides max sword ammo, which is something swords tend to struggle a lot with. Any buff there helps a ton. Balanced Guard gives a much better guard, though you shouldn't worry about ittoo much since you won't be using it. Relentless Strikes is where things get interesting since it gives back sword ammo on continuous light swings---which you'll be doing many of. Finally, we have Chaos Reshaped, increasing damage based on how long you're in combat. A great buff for boss DPS.\n\n\nHow to get the Summum Bonum in Destiny 2\n\n\nThe Summum Bonum comes from the new Salvation's Edge raid. It can drop from the second encounter (Herald of Finality), the fourth encounter (Verity), or the fifth one (The Witness). On top of this, the object that appears after defeating The Witness lets you spend 20 Spoils of Conquest to get a deepsight version of whatever weapon you want, including the Summum Bonum. Getting five of these grants you the ability to craft it.\n\nThe post Destiny 2 Summum Bonum god roll – Best perks and attachments appeared first on Destructoid.",

This witchy farming sim comes from Spellgarden Games, who previously worked on Sticky Business. It's currently due out through publisher Team17 sometime in 2025.\n\n\nBeyond Steam, Ritual of Raven is eyeing a release on Nintendo Switch. Spellgarden is aiming for maximum coziness with this one, as previewed in the announcement trailer below.\n\n\n\n\nRitual of Raven describes itself as a farming sim, but you actually collect and enchant Arcana Constructs to work on your magical herb garden for you. While these magical creatures help grow ingredients for rituals, it's up to you to embark upon quests, befriend various characters, and get to tradin'. You'll also want to suss out what's up with all these portals that have been popping up throughout the land.\n\n\nIf the crux of your coziness lies in customization, it seems there's plenty of it to go around here. You can decorate your farm as you see fit, and you can also apply a bunch of customization options to the wider world of magic beyond your farm's borders.\n\n\nEnchanting ingredients\n\n\nScreenshot via Team17\n\n\nSo far, it all looks like it's eyeing a nice balance between chill sim gameplay and a touch of mystery lurking around the edges. If you want to try it out for yourself and happen to be heading to gamescom, Ritual of Raven will be playable at the event.

If you look at the piece of paper in the office, you'll see that the six-digit code 101225 appears the most, which is the correct passcode to the ZZZ Undercover R&B episode.\n\n\nIf you're having trouble entering this room, you can go through the gates on the right side of the counter. However, some players have indicated that these gates wouldn't allow access. In this case, restart the game and try to go through it again to fix the issue.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nOnce the locker opens, head to the equipment room and grab the master keycard. The path from here is relatively straightforward, but you'll still need the Port Peak videotape to satisfy the gangster's request. You can find it in the Proxy's main hub at Random Play.\n\n\nAlthough the Proxy will take point at this stage, you'll play as Jane Doe again in the next phase. It's the perfect chance to get familiar with her combat and movement, as she will appear as a banner in the second half of Zenless Zone Zero Version 1.1.\n\nThe post What is the passcode in Zenless Zone Zero Undercover R&B episode? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you and your friends have the dream of managing NFL teams, Madden NFL 25's Franchise mode is the perfect option to test yourselves (albeit on the virtual platform).\n\n\nI love playing the Franchise mode as a solo journey, where I am up against the AI managers. But there's an option to conduct a league between you and your friends, where each of you takes charge of a franchise. Let's take a look at the exact steps of setting up a multiplayer league and how your friends can join them.\n\n\nHow to create a multiplayer league with Madden NFL 25 Franchise mode\n\n\nCreating a multiplayer league in Madden NFL 25 isn't very different from a solo league.\n\n\n\nOpen and load the game.\n\n\nSelect Franchise.\n\n\nGo to League Creation and pick the second option.\n\n\nSelect the franchise of your choice.\n\n\nProceed to the next stage to open league settings. Here, you can tweak different settings, including making it public or private (password-protected).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo play with your friends, make sure to create a private league. The maximum number of users is 32. Next, note down the league name and password and share it with your friends.\n\n\nIf you or your friend want to join a league, they can do so from the Franchise mode as well. They will have to enter the league name and password to join the league. Once they're in, they can pick a franchise of their liking and continue with the different aspects of management.\n\n\nThat's pretty much it when it comes to playing Franchise mode with your friends. Just make sure to coordinate and decide who's picking which franchise so there's no quarrel about it later.\n\nThe post How to play Madden NFL 25 Franchise mode with your friends appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Developer BioWare and publisher Electronic Arts released an all-new trailer for the upcoming RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard today that showed glimpses of what to expect from the first title in the series in almost a decade. The focus of the trailer, however, was to indicate when we can expect to get our hands on The Veilguard: October 31, 2024.\n\n\n\n\nEven though we've had to wait almost 10 years to get back to Dragon Age, the wait is almost over. With a Halloween 2024 release date that means we're just 2.5 months away from getting our hands on Dragon Age: The Veilguard.\n\n\nSurely not coincidentally, the story in The Veilguard takes place a decade after the events of its predecessor, Dragon Age: Inquisition. Players will take on the role of Rook and his companions as they put an end to a ritual in progress by Solas, one of your allies and party members from Inquisition who has become a villain. However, doing so breaks free the corrupt Elven gods who are hellbent on blighting the world, and it's now up to you and your party to fight back against the ancient rulers.\n\n\nFor those interested in freshening up on their Dragon Age lore and knowledge, all of the Dragon Age games are currently on sale for 90% off on all platforms through August 19 as part of the ongoing Electronic Arts August sale.\n\nThe post Dragon Age: The Veilguard pits us against corrupt Elven Gods this Halloween appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Pounce Light has announced that its free-form scene creator, Tiny Glade, now has a release date. It’s hitting PC on September 14, 2024.\n\n\nTiny Glade (I keep writing “Grove”) is a cozy game where you construct little buildings using an impressively intuitive editor. There’s no judgement (no “wrong answers” as the developer says), so the goal is to simply create scenes that please you. Maybe pet the sheep while you’re at it.\n\n\n\n\nThe unique hook here is its editor. It’s not grid-based, and features that you place adapt to being morphed. The structure adapts to objects placed, such as windows, so it’s all about plopping and dragging. It’s a game that really sells itself because even watching the trailer and the gifs on the store page is satisfying. \n\n\nI’m someone whose mind has been polluted enough by modernity that I feel the need to have some sort of progression, and it doesn’t look like Tiny Glade has that, but the creation kit alone has me wanting to play it. Considering the fact that poor life choices have practically ensured that I will never own a home of my own, the idea of being able to easily create one from my imagination is appealing.\n\n\nTiny Glade had an impressive demo this past May’s Steam Next Fest. Paula Vaynshteyn gave it a look and came away with a craving for more.\n\n\nWe won’t have to wait long, as Tiny Glade launches on PC September 14, 2024.\n\nThe post Cozy scene-building game Tiny Glade is out in September appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Nintendo Switch is very nearly at the end of its life cycle. It's had a pretty successful run, being a vehicle for Animal Crossing: New Horizon, Tears of the Kingdom, Super Mario Bros. Wonder, and many more. Not to mention, it picked up a lot of the slack from the lackluster Wii U. But what of its follow-up?\n\n\nWell, many of us have been anticipating a launch of the Switch 2 (as it's being referred to currently), with some expecting it to launch maybe at the end of this year. However, that idea seems out of reach now.\n\n\nImage via The New Yorker.\n\n\nAccording to a recent report from Eurogamer – which has corroborated information with the likes of GamesIndustry.biz – the Switch sequel may not see the light of day until later in calendar year 2025. Developers have reportedly been told to not expect it until after the end of the financial year, which would be April at the earliest.\n\n\nNintendon't do this to us...\n\n\nLook, we know it's happening. That's just a given. Rumors about the Nintendo Switch 2 have been inbound for a good while now, and Nintendo itself has confirmed there's a successor on the way.\n\n\nThe Eurogamer article goes on to speculate that we could be looking at a Switch-esque announcement, which was revealed in October 2016, and was subsequently released in March the following year.\n\n\nWhether this is the plan is anybody's guess at this stage. But it feels like we're so on the cusp of receiving official word on the elusive Nintendo Switch 2, if Nintendo's plans to announce news this fiscal year hold true. It also means that – if the rumors are true – then we can wave goodbye to any hopes of getting the new console in time for Christmas 2024.\n\nThe post Nintendo Switch 2 might not launch until April 2025 at the earliest appeared first on Destructoid.",

Playing as the protagonist of our fairytale story, Jot, you'll set off on a magical adventure alongside friends to return to your book and defeat the story's villain, Humgrump. As Humgrump kicks you out of the story and throws the land of Mojo into chaos, you'll have to find your way back in while using the \"real\" world and the book's features to save the day.\n\n\nThe game also features a peculiar shift in art as you swap from 2D to 3D, with the former having a simplistic, cartoonish style and 3D changing to a more realistic approach. I became interested in The Plucky Squire when it was first announced in 2022, and the more I hear about it, the more fascinated I am by its adorable yet slightly bizarre gameplay elements. I don't normally love platformers, but I'm curious to give this one a shot. \n\n\nThe Plucky Squire will be available on September 17, 2024, for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch.\n\nThe post Dimension-swapping adventure The Plucky Squire sets off this September appeared first on Destructoid.",

She’s looking for someone there, but finding them suddenly isn’t her biggest problem. There are both monsters and puzzles about, and safety is beyond the wall.\n\n\n\n\nThe aesthetic and framework are based on ‘00s horror games. The best horror games. While much of the indie horror scene has focused on PS1-style, ‘90s horror was a bit goofy. When we got to the ‘00s, we seemed to hit a sweet spot of hardware horsepower and team sizes. We got games like Silent Hill 2, Fatal Frame, and Rule of Rose. The gameplay could sometimes be stiff, and the combat (especially in those games I just named) was often garbage, but they were invariably interesting.\n\n\nWhat I’m saying is that there’s a diminished focus on combat and more on atmosphere and puzzle-solving. There’s also a mix of dynamic and fixed camera angles. It definitely looks the part.\n\n\nI’ve had my eye on Hollowbody for a while. I had the demo installed since a Steam Next Fest and only uninstalled it in an ongoing struggle to manage the shrinking free territory on my hard drive. So, I didn’t actually play the demo since I thought I’d wait until the full release. That would have made this article easier to write since I’d have more intimate familiarity with the game.

Of all graphic novels sold in the U.S. during 2023, half were manga. Of those who consume manga digitally in Japan, the most prolific are the over 50s; half read manga every day. Estimates show that over 1,300 pirate sites offer manga and in a recent single month, 100 new pirate manga sites appeared online. Cost to the industry: $800m per month.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",
