From 1987 to 1994, it was a subsidiary of Atari Games focused on creating unlicensed titles for the NES by attempting to circumvent Nintendo's licensee restrictions. After obtaining a copy of the Nintendo lock-out program, Tengen was well on its way to creating its own NES cartridges. However, Nintendo promptly sued Tengen which eventually led to the company being consolidated into Time Warner (Atari Games' parent company at the time).\nNow, in 2024, one sole developer by the name of Jeff Silvers has managed to acquire the Tengen name and has used this to create a brand new company called 'Tengen Games'. According to the website, Silvers had conducted research in 2022 and discovered that nobody owned the Tengen name at the time, so simply began a lengthy process of officially registering it with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The registration is now currently in the 'final stages' of completion.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Operation Strix is on and the only way to ensure world peace is to help Anya Forger with her homework. In the case of Spy x Anya: Operation Memories, that means taking her to lots of fun places and taking pictures of her while she does adorable things. It is a low-stakes, cosy adventure that will make fans of the Spy x Family smile and leave everyone else scratching their heads in confusion.\nThe confusion isn’t because the game is particularly complicated – it is actually delightfully, relaxingly simple. However, unless you are familiar with the characters and jokes of Spy x Family, most of the plot of Spy x Anya is going to go straight over your head. The game assumes that you know the overall goal of Operation Strix and that each of the Forgers has a secret they are keeping from everyone else. Loid is a spy. Yor is an assassin. Anya can read minds. Even the dog can see the future.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "According to the wikihow page “how to fall safely”, the best way to minimise injury while falling is to stay loose, keep your arms and legs bent, and roll on impact. According to ragdoll-prone shooter Helldivers 2, however, it’s better to stand to attention in mid-air and perform a crisp salute. It’s long been known that the game’s emotes confer unexpected defensive advantages, with emergency hugs sometimes shielding you against artillery fire, but now, one redditor has proven via careful scientific experimentation that they also protect you against the force of gravity.\r\n \nRead more",

The studio's existence had been under threat since early this year, after being targeted in Embracer's purgatorial studio massacre. At that time the German studio were hopeful to avoid being closed down, insisting \"don't write us off yet!\" Unfortunately, it looks like those who worked at the studio have since been laid off.\nRead more",

The best-known is probably Frostpunk, with its perpetual raging against the dying of the light, its ceaseless scrape for coal and wood as the temperature falls. Anoxia Station, announced this month, is similarly driven by the gathering of fossil fuels, and similarly shaped by questions of worker death and morale, but it takes you deep underground - into a sumptuous, brutal world of quartz crystals, salt caves, magma lakes, moonmilk rivers, swirling gases and, judging from the below trailer, enormous maggots and centipedes. Larva lakes, amirite.\n Read more",

It has now been occupied by Russia for almost two years, during which, as reported by the Associated Press, Russia has demolished, rebuilt and renamed much of the city, overwriting its Ukrainian heritage.\nThe Disco Elysium-inspired RPG Hollow Home is a memory of Mariupol from just before the war - not a 1:1 recreation, but a collection of details, colours, personalities and some familiar buildings, painstakingly amassed and offered up in the face of erasure. Speaking to me during a very brief demo at Digital Dragons in Poland this year, artist Anastasia Hlyniana called my attention to the plants jutting from old car tyres around the game's isometric map, which she says are a common sight in Mariupol.\n Read more",

The tune you were whistling dies in your throat as you hurry past into the reassuring shadow of the relatively gnomeless bungalows to either side. Gardening sim Horticular is like that, but with an even greater sense of contrast, because it asks you to resettle a desolate planet. There is no generic urban scenery to hurry onto, here.

But no seriously, I think no matter if it's a bit Soulsy or not, my key takeaway is one of relief. There's a lot more substance to back up the style than I thought there would be, alongside it feeling a lot more compact than the behemoth I envisioned in my head.

          "description": "I think I've written about it a bazillion times here on RPS, but I do think Elden Ring is a massive open world game that's a bit too large and in charge. I reached the exhaustion point once, and now the DLC's come out, I'm scared I'll reach it again despite the fact I think it's very good. It's interesting then, that FromSoftware's president Hidetaka Miyazaki sees Elden Ring as \"the limit\" for FromSoftware in terms of project scale (cheers The Guardian for the interview, and PCGamer for the spot). I think it's a great thing, personally.\nRead more",

They’d like to “revisit some of the games we've created in the past and modernize them,” Ubisoft told Ubisoft about Ubisoft.\nElsewhere in the blog, Guillemot repeatedly praises what he sees as the potential for generative AI and how it “can enrich NPCs to be more intelligent, more interactive,” saying this could “potentially extend to animals in the world.” So, look forward to remake Ezio putting glue in his pizza sauce I suppose?\n \nRead more",

The answer: it didn’t, at first. Luckily, a semi-quick fix was enough to get me in, where I found a game that for all its ray tracing inclinations, is comfortable with life on the Deck. Reasonably. Most of the time.\nWith any luck, my issue could be purged completely by the time The First Descendant releases on July 2nd. Partly because I was using a technically non-final preview build, and partly because the problem itself was a silly one: launching was blocked by a case of missing Visual C++, something that the Steam Deck’s Proton compatibility witchcraft usually takes care of. Come on, Proton lad, you’re kinda dropping the ball here.\nIf this ever happens to you, in The First Descendant or any other game, I heartily recommend YouTuber JD Ros’ video tutorial on fixing it. The method boils down to installing the latest C++ versions via the Steam Deck’s Desktop Mode, then adding their executables to the game’s launch options. This worked a treat for me, and I didn’t suffer any further compatibility headaches from there on out.\n Read more",

It improves Olympian Boons, adds lots of new UI icons, reworking Keepsakes, and basically touches every aspect of the game you could possibly think of. One thing it doesn't change is how sexy the gods are, but because they're so sexy anyway, I don't think that's an issue moving forwards.\nRead more",

The more than 100 games included at launch was far from stingy, with an extra dozen being added in a free update at the end of last year.

Charming! The Ancient Greek gods were outraged both by the king's violation of the norms of hospitality, and by his general insistence on being too clever by half - and I feel a similar way reading the Xitter feed of Bashir \"ManliestDev\" Kashalo, who is making a game in which you play as Sisyphus after his eventual demotion to Hell's chief stone-shover. \r\n \nRead more",

As someone who mainly plays games on consoles, I believe that there are definitely merits to using a keyboard and mouse.

          "description": "Starry Studios anticipated online survival game, Once Human, has finally arrived. If you’re looking to get into it with friends, you may wonder if you need to be on the same platform as your friends.\n\n\nOnce Human is cross-platform with a few caveats.\n\n\nFirst, it should probably be noted that there is no console version yet. That’s where cross-platform is really tested. Instead, you can play the game through different PC platforms, such as Steam and Epic Games Store. Later on, it will launch on Android and iOS, which will likely also use the same servers. Console versions haven’t been solidly announced.\n\n\nAll the different versions of Once Human have access to the same servers. If you join the same server as your friends, you can play with them. That’s perhaps the most important part.\n\n\nThe big caveat is that you can’t necessarily log in with your Steam account on Epic Games Store. If you’re playing on Steam and decide you want to switch to Epic Games Store (for whatever reason, I’m not judging), then you’ll be starting fresh.\n\n\nHowever, Starry Studios is planning to add more account options in the future that may allow for better conformity. For now, you’ll want to pick your preferred platform and stick with it.\n\n\nHowever, to reiterate, regardless of whether you download from Steam, Epic Games Store, or Loading Bay, you can play with your friends on other platforms. It does have crossplay.\n\nThe post Is Once Human cross platform? appeared first on Destructoid.",

For example, if you create your character on the wrong server. So, can you delete them and start over?\n\n\nBad news: you can’t delete your character.\n\n\nIf you’re reading this article, there’s a chance that it’s already too late. However, before getting further into this, I will clarify that you can’t delete your character right now. This information comes from the Starry Studios Once Human launch FAQ, which also clarifies that being able to have multiple characters will be added in August 2024, which isn’t far off.\n\n\nRight now, you’re kind of out of luck. Even if you went to a different platform, if crossplay is set up, you’re still stuck with that character on the server you chose. One account, one character.\n\n\nThere is one possible solution, and that is to create a new account. Depending on what platform you’re playing on, that might be more trouble than it’s worth, but right now, that seems to be the only possible way to fix it.\n\n\nThe alternative is to contact Starry Studios’ support to see if the character can be removed from the back end. How you do that is another matter. Maybe through Twitter? However, since the FAQ suggests that it’s a technical limitation, it’s not a certainty that anything can be done.\n\nThe post Can you delete your character in Once Human? appeared first on Destructoid.",

The new Arrowhead Games CEO agrees.\n\n\nThe bug footage didn't escape the eye of Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani. Quoting on an X post with the clip, Jorjani simply asks the official Arrowhead account: \"can we please, please keep this?\" \n\n\n\n\nIf the CEO wants the bug to stay, who can say no? Well, maybe Johan Pilestedt, the former CEO. But I'd guess  he'd be on board with keeping it. \n\n\nHell, many players are discussing how the bug can become a real feature. \"I wanna see two ‘divers doing this whilst playing rock / paper / scissors,\" says one Reddit user who was suddenly struck with pure, white-hot brilliance. Other users imagine busting out a Super Earth salute as they aim for the bushes.

However, since Genshin Impact spans various platforms, the button for it varies on each device. So, to cover all the bases, we'll show you how to use Elemental Sight on PS4, PC, and mobile.\n\n\nGenshin Impact Elemental Sight guide\n\n\nTo perform Elemental Sight in Genshin Impact, you can use the following interactions:\n\n\n\nPC: Hold down the Scroll Wheel on your mouse (or adjust Key Bindings) \n\n\nPS4 and PS5: 'L1 + D-Pad Left' buttons\n\n\nMobile: Tap the eye icon on the top-left corner of the screen\n\n\n\nFor PC users, you must hold the middle button on your mouse to produce Elemental Sight. If you don't have a mouse, go to the Paimon menu and select Settings to adjust the Key Bindings of Elemental Sight. Change it to your preferred button for easy access.\n\n\nAlternatively, there's an option to press the 'left-Alt' key to produce a mouse on the screen. You can then click on the eye icon on the top-left corner to gain the sight temporarily.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nGenshin Impact's mobile version of Elemental Sight uses a similar tactic with the eye icon. To get it to work, simply tap the symbol at the top-left corner of the screen.\n\n\nFor PS4 and PS5 players, hold down the 'L1' trigger ('LB' if you're Xbox) and hit left on the D-Pad. You'll see the symbol of the eye here, presenting the interaction for Elemental Sight.\n\n\n\n\n\nElemental Sight only lasts a few seconds, allowing you to find Elemental Trails. You'll likely need this in various missions, puzzles, and domains to guide you to hidden locations. It also helps identify enemies and accessible objects to get a general sense of the lay of the land.\n\nThe post How to use Elemental Sight in Genshin Impact for PC, PS4, and mobile appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Simulanka is a new map expansion coming to Genshin Impact on July 17. It’s a fairytale land full of talking toys and shooting stars, but will it last forever?\n\n\nIs Simulanka permanent?\n\n\nSimulanka is a limited-time area in Version 4.8 of Genshin Impact. It will accompany the patch’s flagship event with new minigames and places to explore. After Version 4.8 ends on August 28, Simulanka will no longer be accessible.\n\n\nThis means all chests and Primogem rewards exclusive to Simulanka will also disappear at the end of the patch. If you don’t want to miss out on any potential rewards, be sure to do a thorough search of the area before it’s gone.\n\n\nImage via HoYoverse\n\n\nWill Simulanka return in the future?\n\n\nThere is a chance we’ll be able to visit Simulanka again in a future patch. Genshin Impact’s summer events always feature a limited-time area, but they’re sometimes old areas with a fresh coat of paint. The Golden Apple Archipelago region was used twice – once in June 2021 and again in July 2022. The second version of the Golden Apple Archipelago was recognizable as the same set of islands, but had new chests, features, and quests. \n\n\nChests in the 2021 version of the Golden Apple Archipelago did not reappear in 2022 if you missed them the previous year. This means that, even if Simulanka does return in a subsequent patch, you probably won’t get to make up for incomplete exploration in the region. It’s best to assume that once Version 4.8 is over, this version of Simulanka will be gone for good.\n\n\nIt’s also possible that Simulanka won’t be seen again. Genshin Impact’s 2023 summer event was set in the Velyuriam Mirage, which is not returning this year. Simulanka and Velyuriam Mirage could be used again for future summer events, or they may be one-off regions. Only the team at HoYoverse knows for sure.\n\nThe post Is Simulanka a limited-time area in Genshin Impact? appeared first on Destructoid.",

That's because developer Sucker Punch Production's Ghost of Tsushima, which originally launched on PlayStation 4 back in 2020, was the best-selling game of May 2024 in the U.S. And that's almost assuredly due to the recent PC release of Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut on May 16. \nGhost of Tsushima Director's Cut hit PC almost four years after the game's initial launch on PS4, which speaks to PlayStation's PC release strategy it detailed last month.

          "description": "The culture around social interaction is constantly shifting, but those profoundly strange years of the pandemic were especially jarring. In the wake of such a weird cultural moment, I’m certainly not the only one left wondering how the dust settles, especially as it relates to how we meet up, build friendships and relationships, and socialize. If you’re a gamer, answering those questions requires an additional layer of complexity since we spend much of our free time in virtual worlds. I’ve found myself wondering where our favorite hobby fits into the equation.\nFor some years, the “third place” gave a name to a thing that’s been part of our lives forever. If home is your first place, and work is your second, the third place is the other social and gathering hub for your life as part of a c…",

Owners of these games will still be able to play their single-player content, but online support for these titles will end on November 7. The embedded announcement post on X also includes a link to an FAQ to answer additional questions about the sunsetting process. \nhttps://t.co/2W8dLlGjBM\nJune 28, 2024\nWhile the digital PS3/Xbox 360 versions of these games are going away, Battlefield 3 will still be available to purchase on PC. The same is true for Battlefield 4 and Hardline, and these two titles will also remain on sale for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The PC/PS4/Xbox One versions will remain unaffected by today’s updates.\nIt never feels good to see games get removed from sale like this. The reason likely has to do with EA sunsetting online support; it wouldn't be right to continue selling games with popular online modes if that component doesn't work anymore. For those still logging into Battlefield matches on PS3 and 360, you've got a few more months to enjoy the ride.\nFor more on Battlefield, you can learn about how the next entry is shaping up (which is being made with help by Dead Space remake developer Motive Studios) here.",

And it continues to look like a scary new addition to the A Quiet Place movie universe. \nThough there's still no release date – it's launching sometime this year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC – this story trailer reveals more about the state of the world in The Road Ahead. It seemingly begins on Day One, when the aliens, which possess incredible hearing that requires people to remain silent to survive, attack Earth. It then jumps ahead to Day 105, with Alex, an asthmatic college student trying to survive the end of the world with her boyfriend Martin, on the hunt for supplies and more. \nCheck it out for yourself in the story trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead below: \n\n\nAs you can see, it seems Alex might be pregnant, which, if you've seen the first A Quiet Place movie, can make trying to remain silent in this world quite difficult. We'll have to wait a little longer to find out how the story of A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead plays out because it launches later this year on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. \nFor more about the game, watch the reveal trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead. \nAre you excited for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead?

And last week, we traveled to California to go hands-on with the game. You can read Game Informer's full Concord preview thoughts here, but in short: it feels great and we're excited to play more. \nWe have a lot of questions remaining about the game's progression, seasonal content, narrative emphasis, and more, but if the handful of hours we've played of Concord are any indication, developer Firewalk Studios has, at the very least, created a fun and great-feeling shooter. In today's New Gameplay Today, host Wesley LeBlanc talks about his visit to PlayStation's HQ to play the game with Kyle Hilliard and how he felt after checking out 10 of the game's 16 heroes and three of its gameplay modes. \n Check it out for yourself in the Concord NGT below: \n\n\nHead to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

Originally slated to launch next month on July 25, the upcoming narrative-driven city-builder is now arriving on September 20.\nDeveloper 11 Bit Studios sates that following a recent beta, the team wants to take extra time addressing feedback to ensure the best possible experience. In a press release, design director Jakub Stokalski and art director Lukasz Juszczyk issued the following statement:\n“Based on the surveys we received after playing Beta, the average rating you gave us was 8 out of 10. We’re super grateful for that! At the same time, it was only a small slice of a work-in-progress, still-growing game. While our backlog is plentiful, it was an opportunity for us to listen to what you enjoyed, and what didn’t quite land yet”. \n“This allowed us to prioritise things better, and bring upfront the features and modifications we were already working on. But we also realised that to guarantee the best possible experience on launch, we need more time to finish the development of Frostpunk 2. That’s why we made the difficult decision to postpone its release to September 20th, 2024”.\n11 Bit States that it plans to work on new additions to existing game mechanics and improve the UI and UX, among other things. \nFrostpunk 2 will launch first for PC on September 20. PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions are planned to arrive later. We recently played the game, and you can read our extensive preview here.",

More specifically, it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam) on August 1, and it brings with it updated visuals and controls and a new skin that harkens back to the original game's most infamous easter egg. \nIn the reveal trailer, we get a look at the graphical improvements Aspyr has implemented in Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, but the game still retains that 2002 PlayStation 2 and GameCube charm. This re-release follows a limited PlayStation 4 physical run that launched back in 2019. \nCheck out the Star Wars: Bounty Hunter announcement trailer below: \n\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, you play as Jango Fett throughout the story, which itself is a prequel to Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. \nIn the original game, there was an easter egg message that said, \"Cash in all bounties to play as Boba.\" However, cashing in all bounties did not let you play as Boba. To make good on that original promise from 2002, Aspyr media has included a Boba Fett skin in Star Wars: Bounty Hunters you can use after completing the game's campaign. \nStar Wars: Bounty Hunter hits PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on August 1. \nWhile waiting for its launch, check out this lengthy gameplay demo of Star Wars Outlaws, another mercenary-centric Star Wars game launching this year.

Though the once previously Xbox-exclusive game has since made its way to PlayStation and PC platforms, it remains unclear which platforms this remaster is coming to. And there's no word on when to expect the remaster either. \nRevealed with a short 47-second teaser trailer, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster looks great, almost more like a remake than a remaster. It's unclear if this is a remaster of the original 2006 game or the HD version of Dead Rising that launched on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC back in 2017. Regardless, we're stoked to head back into a zombie-infested mall with journalist Frank West whenever this remaster launches. \nCheck out the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster teaser trailer for yourself below: \n\n\n\nAre you excited for Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster?

          "description": "The one and only Elden Ring expansion we're getting, Shadow of the Erdtree, launched last week and thousands of Tarnished went to the shadow realm to take on dozens of new enemies, bosses, and more. Now, just a few days later, developer From Software has released a new patch for the game that should make Shadow of the Erdtree a bit easier. \nNow live, Calibration Update 1.12.2 targets the scaling of the attack and damage negation given to players with each Shadow Realm Blessing upgrade. Here's what's changed: \nThe attack and damage negation has been increased for the first half of the maximum amount of Blessing enhancements, and the second half will now be more gradual. \nThe attack and damage negation granted by the final level of Blessing enhancements has been slightly increased. \n\n\nThis patch should apply automatically like any other Elden Ring update but if it doesn't – the Calibration Version listed at the bottom right reads \"1.12.2\" if it has – select \"LOGIN\" and that will apply the latest version of the game. \nThe only other thing this update contains is word from From Software on a confirmed bug where the raytracing settings of Shadow of the Erdtree are automatically enabled (if you've previously loaded save data from previous game versions), which is causing framerate issues for some players. If you're encountering said issues, check to see if you have raytracing on or off in the game's system graphical settings. \nThis patch arrives after one that hit the game last week, which added new hairtsyles, inventory features, balance adjustments, and more to Elden Ring ahead of Shadow of the Erdtree's launch. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review, and then check out this interview where From Software's Hidetaka Miyazaki discusses his approach to difficulty in games. \nWhat do you think of this update?

To access it, go to \"Settings\" on your PS4 version of Minecraft while playing on a PS5 and select \"Preview.\" This preview includes the new Tricky Trials update, so you can venture into the trial chambers, meet a breeze, craft a mace, and more. \nMojang asks that players who encounter bugs during this preview report it to the developer, and more generally, provide any feedback they might have. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Minecraft review, and then check out this story about how actor Jack Black has all but confirmed he's playing Steve in the upcoming live-action Minecraft movie.

For the greater good, it's a case that Sony must lose and for once in a copyright lawsuit, things are headed in the right direction.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.\nThis is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.\nIf you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.\nNow, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)\n>",
