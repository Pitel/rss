WitchSpring R is a whimsical, story-driven RPG that follows the story of Pieberry, a talented young witch who’s grown up in the woods by herself.\nAs the name might suggest, Pieberry is a big fan of pies. And strawberries. The story starts off calmly enough, with Pieberry attempting to leave her magical forest home to track down a strawberry pie like the one she ate as a child, all while trying to understand why she was seemingly abandoned by her parents. It spirals from there, with a vast world and vibrant roster of characters, ranging from pudding monsters and lightning lions to witch hunters and celestial beings. It’s a narrative-driven experience, but the gameplay switches from turn-based combat to fun puzzles quickly.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Credulous fools attribute this to the existence of a \"bank holiday\" on Monday 26th, but true initiates like ourselves know the sobering truth: the Maw has eaten one of our weekdays. We have dispatched our finest gastronauts equipped with extremely long pairs of tweezers to retrieve the missing Monday from the Maw's bowels. We can only hope it hasn't been digested yet - imagine living in a world with a four-day working week? The horror. Anyway, here are this week's PC game releases of note.\nRead more",

          "description": "Almost a decade after his acrimonious departure from Konami, the shadow of Hideo Kojima still looms over Metal Gear Solid. He's there, barely camouflaged, in the undergrowth of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - a remake of the fifth Metal Gear game, originally released in 2004, which tells the tale of a lone US special operator hunting superweapons and old mentors in the jungles of the southern Soviet Union. \r\n\n\r\nI say \"remake\" but this feels more like a re-release, in spirit. True, it now runs on Unreal Engine, with the option of a manual, third-person perspective and cover-shooter controls in addition to the old top-down viewpoints. Yes, it boasts new flourishes, such as wounds now leaving scars, and clothes picking up stray leaves. Yes, there's a new interface with floating in-world menus, which makes shuffling between the layers a bit less awkward. It's the product of much labour, with development split between Konami and external support partner Virtuos. But where Konami's other big restoration project, Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake, is a creative dialogue with the original game, Delta seems consumed by faithfulness to Kojima's original design.\r\n\n \nRead more",

(It came out in 1997, and as such, I think the statute of limitations on spoilers has passed, but if you still intend to play, stop reading now.) The mission completes the long arc of foreshadowing begun by the intro's mention that capital-class spacecraft have been outlawed, following a ruinous war. It turns out that one particular evil corpo has been sneakily building one of these megaships - not only that, but you get to fly inside it, cannons ablazing. It was while doing so that teenage me realised the true exceptionality of the Video Game Artform. You can't fly inside capital ships in, like, symbolist poems or baroque symphonies, can you? You can't fly in poems or symphonies at all, unless you do so metaphorically - \"metaphor\" being a kind of poor man's graphics card.\nThe technology of flight simming has advanced mightily since G-Police's day. For instance: in Everspace 2's just-announced Titans DLC, you get to fly inside not just regular old spaceships, but massive space kaiju with procedurally generated digestive systems.

Instead of diving off a Sphinx and plunging your hidden blade into someone's spinal column, you can look up at the Sphinx and read a paragraph on its significance. Maybe view an actual, real life bit of ancient Egypt from an actual real life museum collection in-game. Perhaps embody an Anglo-Saxon lad in Valhalla, instead, and like, cook up some nettle soup having just got a fresh \"Friar Tuck\" at the local hair choppers (no guarantees on this last bit).\nThis is all to say that Black Myth: Wukong deserves such a mode, too. There were so many times throughout my review time where I stopped and stared and wondered as to something's meaning. Not only in the architecture, but in the characters, too. So here I am with a proposition: how about instead of thwacking things with my staff, I can use it as a walking stick and point it at things I want to learn about.\nRead more",

Still, it does sound like he’s managing to have some fun there, mainly by hitting up Saber Interactive COO and former id Software co-owner Tim Willits for some top tips on how to avenge Edwin’s thieving ways.\nTips about kill-stealing aside, James found time to ask Willits about Space Marine 2's microtransactions, and whether there was any nervousness returning to a cult hit series… especially one a lot of people had almost given up on ever seeing again. “Even the “push forward” combat of the original was part of [id’s] inspiration when we created Doom 2016,” answered Willits. “So for me personally, it’s this huge circle.

So I was intrigued to give the alpha version of Splitgate 2 a go and see if it had a little more substance to it than its initial reveal, which gave off a, \"it's Splitgate but with more money\" feel. \nWell, I think it's… a bit serious? It certainly has more polish and some extra additions, yet I didn't come away from it thrilled by its more competitive, class-based FPS leanings. I think it just needs a bit more time, perhaps, for a portal to open and some silly rocket launchers and baseball bats and zombies to come tumbling out of it.\nRead more",

A long-limbed man riding a bicycle in a threadbare suit chases children down an alley. A gangly, bowler-hatted pursuer scuttles down a long table like a spider. It's familiar enough territory, at least at first glance. But when Tarsier have a body of work subconsciously scarred by phantasms this vivid, recurring nightmares are just as potent.\nRead more",

I’m only tangentially familiar with the Dying Light games, but I was under the impression that the model here was releasing a single game, then updating and expanding it for years. Whether standalone adventure Dying Light: The Beast represents an attempt to course correct after Dying Light 2’s mixed reception, then, I’m not entirely sure. But if nothing else, it does share something in common with all the other adverts at Gamescom tonight: it is a game that exists, and will presumably be playable at some point.\n \nRead more",

Developed well over two decades ago, the original Silent Hill 2 is the magnum opus of Polish horror stalwarts Bloober Team. Running on then-innovative \"Unreal Engine 5\" technology created by Jazz Jackrabbit publishers Epic MegaGames, it's a wonderful abyss of a game that remains perfectly playable today, given a certain amount of tolerance for the quirks of the era.\nIt begins with your character, James Sunderland, descending from the road towards the eponymous Midwestern nowhere-town. Like many games of the period, Silent Hill 2 uses a third-person, over-the-shoulder manual camera, which allows you to glance fearfully up at the monstrous pine trees that fringe the path - each rising from a bulging tide of fog that menaces with the suggestion of approaching figures. There is moisture everywhere, gushing from drain pipes and dribbling down concrete barriers. As you amble into the murk, deathly chords and groaning, unmechanical motifs reverberate from somewhere deep underground. \r\n \nRead more",

I mean, it's the game with Pyramid Head in it - the nearest thing Silent Hill has to a mascot, and it's not like there's an issue of cutting out plot material: each game in the Silent Hill series is, on some level, a distinct story with a distinct protagonist.\nStill, the decision to 'skip' the first game in the series, whose world, narrative themes, music and art direction set the parameters for all the rest, made my brain itch a bit, and when I ran into Bloober's creative director Mateusz Lenart and lead producer Maciej Głomb at a Konami event, I had to ask about it. \r\n \nRead more",

Now, it's Cosmic Storms. Due for release alongside the Stellaris 3.13 Vela update on September 10th, these are a paid \"mechanical expansion\" (priced at a rather chunky £11, $13 or €13, and available as part of the current season pass) that builds upon the game's existing Space Storms, \"providing a deeper experience with strategically meaningful gameplay and beautiful upgraded visuals\". Wash that down with new civics, precursor narratives, anomalies, archaeology sites, techs, edicts, a new Ascension perk, and new galactic community resolutions.\n Read more",

But I'm also the ideal reviewer to tear it apart over the most minor hiccups and defects. I'm the Anton Ego of factory games. I don't like food, I love it. If I don't love it, I don't swallow.\nAh, you needn't worry. This is by far the most fun I've had reviewing a game, and Shapez 2 has, in my mind at least, turned the holy trinity of factory games (Factorio, Satisfactory, Dyson Sphere Program) into a holy quartet. Its pared back, everything-is-free-forever approach is quite liberating, and I've never had so much fun placing conveyor belts in my life. But 40 hours into my save file, I've often found myself yearning for a bit more creativity in the challenges, a few more curveballs sent in my direction.\n Read more",

Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s October 31st release date leaked earlier, Steam have put together a Summer Fright Night bundle featuring RPS fave Hauntii, and I’ve got a strange urge to gorge on Haribo and mini Double Deckers until blood comes out of my eyeballs. What a perfect time, then, to dive into the alpha demo for vampire management game Blood Bar Tycoon, especially since Two Point seem to be resting on their laurels a bit too comfortably for my liking.\nThe idea here is you build a swanky bar serving claret cosmopolitans, ichor-ish coffees and uh, viscera vampiros to your undead clientele. But (with the sorta exception of the crimson-sapped Dracaena cinnabari) blood doesn’t grow on trees, so you’ll also be moonlighting as a human-nabber. You’ll research a slew of “whacky contraptions” to extract their blood, which I greatly enjoy, because “zany exsanguination” is a real winner of a feature. You can’t frivolously phlebotomise with impunity, however - you’ll also want to be on the lookout for vampire hunters aka the fun police.\n \nRead more",

          "description": "It's hard not to feel Visions of Mana is a bit of a surprise. The Mana series has quietly stirring for some time at Square Enix's studios; the Collection of Mana, and 2020's 3D remake of Trials of Mana, all seem like trial balloons in hindsight. \n\n\nNow, Visions of Mana is the first fully-fledged new entry since 2006's Dawn. The good news? It's practically overflowing with Mana charm, even when its showing some rough edges.\n\n\nVisions of Mana is an action RPG that keeps to its roots in many ways. The protagonist, Val, is a bright-eyed warrior who's more than happy to play Soul Guard to his entrusted Alm and childhood pal Hinna. They're tasked with taking Hinna to the Mana Tree, so she and the other Alms of various elements can give their lives to keep the Mana of the land flowing.\n\n\n\n\nWe're …",

          "description": "Sure, surviving the frosty tundra of a frozen Earth is rough enough, but what if you add dinosaurs to the mix? Well, that may just be an option when the post-apocalyptic sequel Frostpunk 2 launches in September. Developer 11 bit studios teased mod support for the survival city-builder via Twitter earlier today with a brief video clip.\n\n\n\n\nMod support would be pretty chill-y\n\n\nThroughout the video we see a variety of, let's just say, not normal Frostpunk entities including a T-Rex, a dragon, the massive circular roaming base from 11 bit studios' other upcoming title, The Alters, as well as an army of adorable pink creatures from their recently released Creatures of Ava.\n\n\nFrostpunk 2 already looks to be a quality sequel to the original, putting players in the role of building a prosperous settlement in the Arctic wastes, managing the various factions that reside inside instead of focusing purely on surviving. But the official mod support always has the potential to add a ton of new content as well, once players are able to learn how the modding works and start pushing what can be done with it.\n\n\nThe video teased that we will learn more in just a couple of days on August 28. Popular mod solution mod.io also commented on the tweet asking, \"What could it be?👀\". With more recent titles adding mod.io support, it's quite possible that's the route that 11 bit studios have taken with integrating mod support into Frostpunk 2. But as the video says, we will find out more on August 28.\n\n\nI already have a ton of ideas of what types of mods I'd love to see in Frostpunk 2, but dinosaurs and dragons aren't a bad start. Frostpunk 2 is set to release on September 20, 2024, on PC via Steam, Epic Game Store, and GOG as well as on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5. It will also be a Day One on Game Pass release.\n\nThe post Frostpunk 2 hints at mod support, featuring a T-Rex, ahead of September release appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Twitter user playsegasaturn has posted images from Gamescom displaying a Sega Saturn arcade stick and a prototype wireless Dreamcast controller. These haven’t been officially announced by the company and seem to be in an early state, but they’re a good indication of future plans.\n\n\nThe arcade stick is somewhat similar to the console’s Virtua Stick (it’s displayed next to a Virtua Stick box) while also being evocative of the Sega Astro City control panel. It has 8 buttons and (confusingly) labeled for both Switch and other platforms. There’s a large number of sync options on the dial for xinput, dinput, Switch, Sega Saturn, and so on.\n\n\nBesides that, there is the wireless Dreamcast controller. It looks to largely be a similar form factor as the standard-issue console controller. However, there are additional face buttons and a different stick and d-pad. Notably, there is no window for a VMU display. However, there is also what looks like the preliminary mold for something that would contain a VMU. Either way, it looks like a very early prototype, and it could change. I don’t know why it would have such a large face without the VMU window, so I imagine it just isn’t implemented yet.\n\n\nNeither device has yet received Sega’s approval, so things may change to meet their vision. Retro-bit has previously released replica Genesis and Saturn controllers, and have even released a new wireless Saturn controller with added analog sticks.\n\n\nI could honestly use a wireless Dreamcast controller. Living rooms have changed, and I have had to buy cable extenders for my wired ones. On the other hand, I don’t need a new stick. I’ve done modifications on the one I currently use to make it suit my preferences, and they take up a lot of space. However, if the design changes to something closer to a Sega Astro City panel, then I may be enticed.\n\n\nNo word on when we’ll see either of the controllers.\n\nThe post Retro-Bit is showing off a Saturn arcade stick and wireless Dreamcast controller appeared first on Destructoid.",

You may remember this Black Ops Cold War mechanic, allowing you to pick up a body and use it as a defense mechanism. Black Ops 6 offers this maneuver once again, which will go along nicely with its new Omnimovement.\n\n\n\n\nBesides the body shields, we got a brief snippet of some shiny new toys to try. One, in particular, is a baseball bat melee weapon with a brutal Finishing Move. The RC-XD (Remote Controlled Explosive Device) also makes an appearance, bringing chaos along with it. Both tools were a part of past Call of Duty iterations, and now they'll be revamped in BO6.\n\n\nThe list of returning CoD features from this latest trailer could go on and on, including the classic tomahawks and Prestige system. Plus, the reveal confirms the comeback of the Prestige Master, a mechanic that permits players to reach Level 1,000. Although you won't be able to use it in the beta, it should be good to go by launch day. \n\n\nImage via Activision\n\n\nIn addition to this content, you can look forward to plenty of new features, especially with the 16 Black Ops 6 exclusive maps. The trailer already gave us a sneak peek into the brand-new locations, from the tropics to desolate buildings.

          "description": "The adorable yet powerful ensemble of Generation 8 will finally be coming to Pokémon Go as Niantic unveils a teaser of the upcoming Max Out event.\n\n\nSword and Shield fans will quickly notice the sightings of Grookey, Scorbunny, and Sobble. The creatures made their mark as starters in Pokémon SW and SH, encapsulating Grass, Fire, and Water Types. Now, they'll seemingly return to Pokémon Go for the Max Out event from Sept. 3 to Dec. 3.\n\n\n\n\nThe teaser also showcases a possible Gigantamax Form toward the end, which is another Sword and Shield exclusive. This form substantially increases a Pokémon's size, similar to Go's XXL creatures. It also offers G-Max moves that take their normal attacks to new heights.\n\n\nAlthough the event is still under wraps, the starters and the Gigantamax Form Pokémon will likely be obtainable during the celebration. Grookey, Scorbunny, and Sobble have the potential to work their way up the meta, as we've seen with Generation 7's Popplio and Generation 9's Fuecoco.\n\n\nImage via Game Freak\n\n\nGrookey proves to be an excellent Grass Type, with its two robust evolutions, Thwackey and Rillaboom. Then, there's the fiery Fire Type, Scorbunny, considered the best starter of Sword and Shield. But, if you're more of a Water enthusiast, Sobble can be a beast on the battlefield, especially with its all-powerful evolution forms.\n\n\nSince the Pokémon Go Max Out event is out in September, we should be getting more news on what it will entail. Many other events, including the Ponyta and Galarian Community Day, are already in the works. So, clear your calendars and get your Poké Balls ready for Generation 8's debut on Sept. 3.\n\nThe post Niantic teases Pokémon Go Sword and Shield starters launch, with upcoming Max Out event appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "While killing enemies and controlling lanes are the main objectives in Deadlock, other objectives matter just as much and are crucial once you step into the late game.\n\n\nOne such buff that might not be self-explanatory is the Rejuvenator, and its Rejuvenation Credit buff. Here's what the Rejuvenator does in Deadlock.\n\n\nWhat does the Rejuvenation Credit buff do in Deadlock?\n\n\nImage via Destructoid.\n\n\nThe Rejuvenation Credit buff is given upon killing the Mid Boss, marked by a small golden symbol in the middle of the map. This boss, when killed, drops the Rejuvenator, which you need to heavy melee to secure. Once you do, all living teammates will be granted the Rejuvenation Credit buff for a lengthy period. This buff causes all minions you kill to drop 50% more souls and reduces the timer on your next respawn by half. It also grants increased health regeneration.\n\n\nThe Rejuvenation Credit buff is lost upon death, though the respawn reduction applies to this death. It's also worth noting that this buff can be stolen by the enemy team. If your team manages to kill the Mid Boss, but fails to melee the Rejuvenator before the enemies do, they'll receive the buff instead.\n\n\nWhen should you go for the mid boss and Rejuvenator?\n\n\nYour team should attempt the mid boss either when you have a substantial lead or when several enemy players are dead. If you attempt the Mid Boss while all enemies are up, there's a good chance they could rush into the mid boss room and melt your team. \n\n\nWorse yet, one person could sneak in and steal it. If the enemies are defending all lanes from minions in their base, it could be worth the risk. All in all, you should attempt it very cautiously and assess the situation.\n\nThe post What does the Rejuvenator do in Deadlock? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you’ve got the stomach for some disturbing space horror, Mouthwashing will have you covered on September 26, 2024. It’s coming to PC.\n\n\nThat’s exciting. Y’know, in an “I can’t wait to be existentially distressed” kind of way. Did you play the demo? I can’t see this one having a happy ending. It’s about a crew of five people stranded in space after a disaster upends their long-haul delivery mission. The captain has been left immolated and is dubiously alive. Supplies are low, and chances of rescue are slim. Everybody hates each other, and these contents are under pressure.\n\n\n\n\nThe crew decides to open up the cargo hold and find stacks of boxes packed with bottles of mouthwash. High in both sugar and ethanol, great for what ails you. The game jumps around back and forth in time, and nightmarish sequences are interspersed throughout.\n\n\nThe scariest part, though? Each time the scene transitions, the game looks like it glitches out, and the audio hitches like your computer is crashing. It got me more times than I want to admit.\n\n\nThis is all based on the demo, by the way. Anything could have been changed by now. However, it was a ridiculously effective demo, which is still available if you want to try it out. Its audio-visual tricks just make things all the more uncomfortable. It doesn’t matter if a monster shows up at that point. The isolation of the ship, the people inside, and the vast vacuum around it are scary enough.\n\n\nMouthwashing releases for PC on September 26, 2024.\n\nThe post Nightmarish sci-fi horror Mouthwashing arrives in September appeared first on Destructoid.",

More importantly, I don’t remember the last time I played a decent, new vehicular combat game. Maybe Gas Guzzlers Extreme or Carmageddon: Max Damage. Quite a drought in games about stapling miniguns to station wagons.\n\n\nFatal Run was a very latterday game for the Atari 2600 and 7800. As such, it was pretty much unknown to anyone outside the core fanbase of those consoles until its inclusion in the Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration. That’s when I played it, and while the 2600 version just feels significant for the way it translated the game to well-fermented hardware, the 7800 version was fun. Of course, as a fan of raster racing games and car combat, I was set.\n\n\n\n\nFatal Run 2089 looks pretty fun. It’s running on Unreal Engine 5, but I wouldn’t have guessed that. It has the grungy metal look and simple terrain of an Unreal Engine 3 title. However, it does have it where it counts, by which I mean when you land a jump, the camera shakes to make it seem like your car is very heavy.

          "description": "A new Nintendo stream is upon us, and it's airing on pretty short notice. Tomorrow, August 27, Nintendo will host a two-part stream featuring an Indie World Showcase followed by a Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase.\n\n\nThe stream goes live at 7 a.m. PT / 10 a.m. ET on Nintendo's YouTube and other channels. The Indie World Showcase will air first, followed by the Partner Showcase, for a total of roughly 40 minutes, after all is said and done.\n\n\n\n\nIn case the names didn't tip you off, don't expect any news about the successor to the Nintendo Switch here. Not only do these streams normally not focus on Nintendo news (Partners and Indies are both third-party showcases), but Nintendo is outright saying that there will be no mention of the Switch successor.\n\n\n\n\nWhat can we expect then? Well, the Silksong faithful are already donning their clown masks. And I mean, we have to hear something about that game again at some point, right? Oh no. It's happening to me too.\n\n\nI expect the Indie World side of things to be full of surprises and, fingers crossed, a \"later today\" drop or two. Those are always exciting to see, and my Switch could use a new indie game or two to pick away at.\n\n\nAs for the Partner Showcase, that will be all third-party offerings. My best speculation is to expect some frequent collaborators; Square Enix, for example, or Marvelous. I'd love to get some more details on whatever Level-5 has been up to as well. After the delay of Fantasy Life i into 2025, I'm curious about where that's left their other games, like Decapolice.\n\n\nWe'll find out what's in store for the Switch as we head into the Nintendo Direct double-header tomorrow at 7 a.m. PT.\n\nThe post Nintendo is hosting a Direct double-header tomorrow, with indies and partners alike appeared first on Destructoid.",

Many believed that the band itself was responsible, something we highlighted in our August 2009 article. Coinciding almost perfectly with the leak's 15-year anniversary, a complaint filed with Google now claims that the report violates copyright law and must be permanently deindexed from search results.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",
