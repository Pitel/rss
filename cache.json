The good news is that it seems to have proven a hit with critics, though it doesn't reach the heights of some of Nintendo's most prestigious Switch games, gaining a total score of 33/40. The split for this one is relatively even at 8 / 8 / 9 / 8.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "There's always room for one more good one.\nAbout five years ago, solo developer Evan Tor set out to make a new game in the crowded Metroidvania genre called Rebel Transmute. Tor launched a Kickstarter in 2022 to secure the funding to get the game over the line, and after a successful campaign and development period, the title has finally made it to consoles and PC. Rebel Transmute may not be a particularly innovative new entry in the genre, but what it lacks in novel ideas it more than makes up for in polish and quality. Rebel Transmute is great comfort food for the dedicated Metroidvania fan, and we’d suggest you pay attention to it.\nRebel Transmute places you in the role of Moon Mikono, a “space scrapper” in search of her mother who’s gone missing in action. Her search brings her to the isolated planet of Terra 6, which was once home to an extensive research facility helmed by the mysterious Foray corporation that her mother worked for. An EMP causes Moon’s ship to crash on Terra 6, and she wakes up twelve years later in a hostile and decrepit environment where something has since clearly gone wrong. Moon’s mother appears to be alive and somewhere on the planet, so our unlikely heroine sets out on a journey to find her and figure out what happened to the facility.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Generative AI is all over the entertainment industries right now, and lots of people in games are making excited noises about finding new ways to integrate it into their products, from game developers and publishers such as Ubisoft and Square Enix to platform holders and hardware firms such as Epic and Nvidia. This new industry obsession is still taking shape, and there are lots of questions still to be answered about how much it might cost in the future, who will have access to it, and what it will actually help with, not to mention fears about job losses and other harms. But there’s a bigger question bubbling underneath all of this that threatens to burst the wobbly generative AI bubble: is the entire boom built on stolen labour?\nRead more",

In this sequel to 2016's alternately wistful and frenzied action-RPG, you are a debonair-looking sod with a hoverboard, paraglider, blades and guns, sent out into the procedurally generated realms of the Overgrowth to kill Abyss Kings, eat stat boosts and extract with loot.\nThe aforesaid hoverboard and glider, together with the streaking neon visual direction, suggest a game of fluid acrobatics, akin to the studio's last release Solar Ash, which, to quote Ed's review, \"has you rollerblade around shattered worlds like a post apocalyptic gazelle on wheels\". Perhaps that game exists deeper within Hyper Light Breaker, but during my 20 minutes with the game at GDC, I found myself stopping and starting and struggling to build momentum using a combat system that felt both deliberately challenging and stilted. \nRead more",

Gone are the professorial waistcoat and bow tie of his angular 1992 incarnation, replaced instead by the grubby suit of a life-bruised 1930s noir PI, complete with hipflask of brandy for when the stress of being unaccompanied with the lights out gets too much.\nCarnby isn’t the only one who’s transformed in this reboot of Alone in the Dark, the classic survival horror avant la lettre, either. Veterans will find plenty of callbacks and familiar names as they poke around its Louisiana manor house – talk of the Pregzt Shipping Company might raise an eyebrow, for instance, as may the gnarled tree filling much of the conservatory. But like these, everything here is remixed, rewritten, relocated. Indeed, Decerto house is no longer empty but a ‘home for the mentally fatigued’, while player characters Carnby and Emily Hartwood now arrive together, since she’s hired him to help check on her uncle, a long-term resident who may be in danger.\nRead more",

          "description": "Solo developer Billy Basso's enigmatic Metroidvania Animal Well has been dated for May 9th, publishers Bigmode announced yesterday. In it, you'll explore a vast labyrinth of tunnels, solve puzzles and escape its many mammalian-based horrors, all of whom  are out to gobble you up in one fell swoop - though as a strange, tiny little blob creature the size of a chicken nugget, it's unclear both what you are, and why exactly you're so appetising to them. Well, it probably has something to do with looking like a sentient chicken nugget, I suppose. Come and watch the release date trailer below. \nRead more",

I've only seen three of them so far, out of its total of eight, but it's immediately obvious just how much of a step-up these places are compared to the dusty plains and rolling hills of the most recent Final Fantasy game to hit PC, FF15. An obvious take, perhaps, given that FF15 first came out eight years ago in 2016, but I'm sure anyone (all right, mainly me) who's ever despaired at Noctis' seeming inability to climb even the smallest hillock in front of him, or how everyone always rides right into your backside while gunning about on a chocobo, will feel some m…",

In Death Of A Wish, combat has substance: it's a form of redemptive self-expression. The game's fights are a means of asserting and cherishing yourself in the face of a world that regards you as a deviant, a world whose poison you carry on the inside. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Either way, when I’m done, I’ll put the day’s harvest into the processing machines to work while I’m away, and then go exploring for minerals.\nMy goals are clear. I need to build a new machine, or upgrade my mech so that I can clean up a new area of the map and get new resources in return. Those will – you guessed it – let me build new machines or upgrade my mech again. There might be a few steps to juggle on the way, but nothing that needs me to hold long recipe flowcharts in my head.

As with the Arc Thrower stratagem, the lightning shotgun fires arcs of electricity that conduct between players and enemies alike, but there's a fresh armour perk, Electrical Conduit, which reduces arc damage by 95%, allowing close-knit teams of Helldivers to roll around the battlefield frazzling themselves without much penalty. \nStill, I think the real star pick here is surely the Localization Confusion booster, which extends the time between enemy spawns, allowing weirdo solo players such as myself to disentangle from a dragged-out gunfight a little more gracefully.\nRead more",

          "description": "Cast your eye over the original Outcast from 1999 today, and you'll find a world that's more abstract than alien. Hazy, almost block colour textures are stretched to breaking point over terrain that looks like it's been pulled and poked by a child sculpting in putty slime, while its cast of beige, three-fingered Talans are so rigid that they'd all be reigning champions at the local robot dance-off. Understandable, given the era in which is was made, but even so - what a difference 25 years make. Even after 2017's remake glow-up with Outcast: Second Contact, A New Beginning's version of Adelpha is a lush and verdant paradise, with treetops soaring over your head, and mountains requiring several triple or quadruple jetpack jumps to traverse. It's no Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora, admittedly, but it leans in very much the same direction, punching your eyeballs with such bright, primary colours that you'll feel enticed to explore every inch of it.\nA shame, then, that all its visual splendour amounts to is little more than an empty husk filled with open world busy work that already felt tired and done ten years ago. Its non-linear approach to storytelling remains intact, letting you tackle the quests and problems of its numerous village settlements in any order you wish, but even this has been boiled down to tedious checklists of fetch quests, escort missions and shooting up the same identikit facility one after another. Topping off this fatal combo is returning protagonist Cutter Slade, whose macho army dude dial is still set firmly to cringey wise-cracking and patronising stereotypes. A new beginning this ain't.\nRead more",

It's easily slid into one of my favourite games of the year without question, and presumably, for the hundreds of thousands of others who've also opted into preserving democracy.\nBut there seems to be this sentiment that Helldivers 2's roaring success has come as a shock, so much of a shock that top execs and investors are doing YouTube thumbnail faces in boardrooms with mini-nuke explosions erupting from their heads.

But it turned out that the critical perspective was something Nemati appreciated, and so we had a chat that dug down into the meat of it all.

And then you have games like Ereban: Shadow Legacy, which has just been given a release date - 10th April. In this mystical third-person stealth-platformer, your character can literally disintegrate and travel through shadows as a ripple of dark energy - a transformation that puts me in mind less of Thief than of squid-mode in Nintendo's Splatoon. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Unless you’re a long-term fan of his work, you might have asked that upon hearing about Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story, the latest interactive documentary from Digital Eclipse (following on from The Making Of Karateka and Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration). You might have heard Minter’s name in connection with the remake of the unreleased Atari arcade game Akka Arrh in 2023. Maybe you played his mind-warping shooter Polybius in VR. You might remember as far back as the Atari Jaguar and Minter’s phenomenal Tempest 2000, the unexpected highlight of the console’s library. Or perhaps you recall his work from the 8-bit glory days. You could just know him from the daily videos of him feeding his sheep on YouTube.\r\n\n\r\nThe point is that Jeff Minter has been making games for a phenomenally long time – more than 40 years, in fact. And in all that time, he has stayed true to what he believes in. “One of the things we say in the game itself is the idea of him being the last indie developer,” says Chris Kohler, editorial director at Digital Eclipse in California. “The last of the people from the early 80s who very consciously never sold out, never took the money, never looked to expand or do anything other than [be] just Jeff at his computer, making the sorts of video games that he wants to make.”\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's just designed in an \"agnostic\", systems-first way and this in itself makes stealth a possibility. It's also a quiet attempt to capture something of the intricacy of a full-blown military simulator, while still being a very \"arcadey\" game at heart, which owes a little to Arrowhead's own collective time in the military.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Cline, who you will remember is the writer of Ready Player One, is apparently one of the co-founders of Readyverse, and I'm sad to see he's still in search of a second idea. Open (that's the name of the game, but it's in all caps in their press assets) is an \"immersive multiverse filled with nostalgia-infused biomes featuring characters and cultural legends across iconic franchises\", coming to early access this year. Also it somehow involves web3.\nRead more",

I don't know how White Wolf's RPG is viewed in the land of table tops these days, but here in computerville it has delivered exactly one good video game in the last 25 years (and don't come gibbering to me about 2022's Swansong, it wasn't fit to polish Bloodlines' fangs). Sure, Bloodlines 2 might prove a winner, but given years of delays and a developer change, I'll believe it when I see it.\nWhich brings us to Vampire: The Masquerade - Justice, the beleaguered series' first prowl through the rain-slick streets of VR. In theory, this should be exactly my cup of haemoglobin; a gothic, linear stealth game where you use your vampire powers to sneak across the rooftops of Venice. In its mechanics and design, Justice aspires to be a cut down version of Dishonored. Unfortunately, it's in the cutting down where most of its problems arise. It's too cramped, too basic, and too fuzzy around the edges, and the whole experience ends up being a bit mid.\nRead more",

          "description": "Even those of you who don't play Stardew Valley will almost certainly be aware that the big 1.6 update went live yesterday. It adds a ton of new content to the game, seemingly well worth the wait. As such, it will surprise exactly zero people to learn that this has resulted in a massive boost in the game's popularity.\n\n\nAs noted by SteamDB, Stardew Valley's new patch has led to a jump in concurrent players on Steam. The screenshot from the Twitter/X post below shows it peaked at 102,774 players, setting a new record for the game. However, even this is outdated, as that figure has since risen to 146,159, according to the most recent data.\n\n\n\n\nIt's also jumped a pretty hefty 90 places on Steam, where it's currently sitting at number nine on the Top Sellers list. This will most likely change as time goes on, but one can imagine Eric \"ConcernedApe\" Barone will be waking up today as a rather happy developer.\n\n\nConsole and mobile patches coming soon\n\n\nAs for what version 1.6 actually contains, it's a seriously humongous list of changes, new editions, bug fixes, quality-of-life improvements, and the lot. You're honestly best off checking out the changelog on the Stardew Valley website, but be prepared to get a bit of soreness from all that scrolling. It's a huge update, is what I'm saying.\n\n\nExamples of some of the new features include (but are definitely not limited to): a new festival, a new farm type, the ability to add multiple pets, winter outfits for NPCs, a bookseller who \"comes to town twice a season,\" and a shed load more.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the update is only available on PC for now. Barone has said Xbox is \"incoming soon,\" so those of us who play on console and iOS/Android will need to wait a little bit longer.\n\nThe post Unsurprisingly, Stardew Valley has smashed its all-time player record appeared first on Destructoid.",

Stardew Valley is no different, but there’s a new Chest to help with this — the Big Chest. \n\n\nWhile a regular Chest has 36 slots, the Big Chest has 70 slots, so it’s worth crafting this improved storage option. You don’t even need to move anything from your Chests to a new Big Chest, because the Big Chest can be placed on top of a regular Chest. You also get the original Chest back! \n\n\nHow to make a Big Chest\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nTo make a Big Chest, you’ll first need to purchase the recipe from Robin for 5,000 gold. It’s a relatively easy recipe to craft, using the following materials:\n\n\n\n130 Wood\n\n\n2 Copper Bars\n\n\n\nHow to place a Big Chest\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nPlacing a Big Chest is done in the same way that you place anything in the world. Build the Big Chest in your crafting menu and then select it from your inventory. Once you’re rather impressively wielding the chest above your head, pick a spot and then place it down. \n\n\nTo replace a smaller Chest with a new one, place it in the same way and once you’ve placed the bigger Chest down, your old Chest will fly off to the side ready for you to pick up and use again, if you need even more storage.\n\nThe post How to craft a Big Chest in Stardew Valley appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you’re an animal lover, then one of the updates to Stardew Valley in 1.6 will make you very happy indeed. You can now have more than one pet on your farm and it’s actually not too difficult to do. Here’s how to get a second (or further) Pet in Stardew Valley. \n\n\nYou get your first pet very early into the game, once you earn 1000 Gold. Marnie shows up at the Farm brandishing an animal (either a cat or a dog, depending on which you chose while making your character) for you to adopt. Until now, this would be your only pet for a whole playthrough, but now you can have more. \n\n\nYou must reach the maximum friendship level with your first pet before you can purchase any further pets. To do this, you'll need to give them water in their food bowl and pet them regularly. You'll know when you've reached maximum friendship because you'll see a pop-up that says \"(Animal name) loves you\". You can check your friendship level with your pet through the animals tab in the pause menu.\n\n\nHow to get more Pets in Stardew Valley\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nIn order to get an additional pet, you’ll need to visit Marnie at her home, which is directly south of the farm map. Here, you’ll be able to adopt a cat, a dog, or a turtle. After spending your gold, Marnie will tell you that your new pet will be on your farm shortly. \n\n\nOnce you’ve secured ownership of your second pet, you’ll need an additional food bowl on your farm to help them feel at home. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nTo get an additional food bowl you’ll need 25 Hardwood, then head to Robin’s house and after speaking to her, select “Construct Farm Buildings''. Find the food bowl and then select your style before pressing “build”. \n\n\nPlace the bowl down on your farm and after a brief ‘construction period’, your new bowl will be set up and ready to go for your new pet! \n\nThe post How to get a second Pet in Stardew Valley 1.6 appeared first on Destructoid.",

To prevent this, use a Tent Kit.\n\n\nThe Tent Kit is a new, single-use item that was added with the 1.6 update of Stardew Valley. It works a little like a Campfire, meaning you can craft one and put it down wherever you like and sleep there overnight. \n\n\nWhile I wouldn’t advise setting out on any long expeditions any time soon, Tent Kits are useful in a pinch so it’s a good idea to always keep one in your inventory, or otherwise carry the materials to craft one if you need it.\n\n\nHow to get a Tent Kit\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe first way to get a Tent Kit is by venturing to Ginger Island and visiting the Jungle on the Eastern side of the map. Here, you’ll find a package containing not one but three Tent Kits. \n\n\nOtherwise, you’ll need to craft one if you’re in need.

          "description": "Gone are the days of leaving a fruit tree where it is because you don’t want to give Pierre gold for a new sapling. \n\n\nOne thing that has been updated in Stardew Valley 1.6 that has players incredibly thankful is the fact that fruit trees will now drop saplings when chopped down. Here’s what Stardew creator ConcernedApe has said in the patch notes:\n\n\n“Chopping down a fruit tree now yields the appropriate fruit sapling. If the tree is mature (i.e. the fruit quality is > basic), it will yield a sapling with the same quality as its fruit. The higher the quality, the faster the sapling will mature.”\n\n\nHow to get high quality Fruit Tree saplings\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nA tree will drop a sapling that is of the same quality as the fruit that was on the tree when it was chopped down. This means that if a tree was providing you with Iridium quality fruit, then the sapling you’ll receive from chopping down this tree will be of Iridium quality. \n\n\nHow does Sapling quality affect tree growth\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nTrees have four stages of growth until they are fully grown and each stage takes seven in-game days to complete. Once a tree is fully mature, the fruit it provides will increase one star in quality each year it is in place. After four in-game years, your fruit tree will provide you with Iridium quality fruits. \n\n\nSaplings that are gained from chopping down a tree which provides Iridium quality fruits will go through their growth stages at a faster rate.\n\n\nHowever, you will not immediately get fruit that is of the same quality as the sapling you planted. Even if you plant Iridium quality saplings, fruit trees will still need to go through the year-on-year improvement that they always have.\n\nThe post How to get high quality Fruit Tree saplings in Stardew Valley 1.6 appeared first on Destructoid.",

This is part of the process of repairing the Community Center, so you’ll need to catch at least one Eel to progress through the story of Stardew Valley. \n\n\nOther than this, Eels can be used as an ingredient in the following recipes:\n\n\n\nFried Eel\n\n\nMaki Roll\n\n\nQuality Fertilizer\n\n\nSashimi\n\n\nSpicy Eel\n\n\n\nYou can also use an Eel in the spool of the Sewing Machine in order to craft a Sailor Shirt, and it can be placed in the Dye Pots at Emily and Haley’s house as an Orange dye. \n\n\nEels can be placed in your Fish Pond and will reproduce every three days. Once in your Pond, Eels will produce Eel Roe, which can then be used in the following ways:\n\n\n\nAs an ingredient in Aged Roe and Caviar\n\n\nIn the spool of the Sewing Machine to create a Polka Dot Shirt \n\n\n15 Roe is an option in the Fish Farmer’s Bundle in Pantry (Remixed)\n\n\nThe post How to catch an Eel in Stardew Valley appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, unlocking this feature requires buying a specific crafting recipe and obtaining some challenging items before diving into cooking mechanics.

Once you get every item, craft the smoker and use a fish alongside some coal before waiting for them to finish cooking. Much like using a furnace, it isn't an immediate process, making this a good time to do other things before returning to grab your food. Eventually, the fish will finish smoking, allowing you to give it to the raccoons, keep it, or sell it for extra money.\n\nThe post How to smoke fish in Stardew Valley 1.6 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "On March 19, patch 10.2.6 for World of Warcraft: Dragonflight went live bringing with it an all-new game mode: Plunderstorm. Plunderstorm is essentially a fast-paced pirate-themed battle royale mode. However, there's not really any instruction on how to play Plunderstorm in World of Warcraft. Here's how to jump into the battle royale mode and play right away.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHow to queue for the new Plunderstorm game mode\n\n\nIn order to play Plunderstorm in World of Warcraft, you need to actually enter it from the character selection screen. If you are already logged in, you need to log out to the character select screen. Once you're at the screen where you normally choose a character or realm to log in to, you need to look in the top left corner. Alongside the World of Warcraft: Dragonflight logo you will actually see a completely separate logo for Plunderstorm. Click this logo and it will switch to the Plunderstorm queue instead of the default character login queue.\n\n\nOnce you're on this new Plunderstorm screen you can click Customize Character to customize the pirate character you will be playing Plunderstorm as. When you are ready to play, just click Join Game and you will enter the queue to play Plunderstorm!\n\n\nThe only requirement to play Plunderstorm is having an active World of Warcraft account with active game time, either for retail WoW or WoW Classic. You do not need to have the World of Warcraft: Dragonflight expansion, but you do need to have the Dragonflightretail client downloaded and installed to play Plunderstorm.\n\n\nYou can choose to queue solo or with a friend in duos. All progress on the Plunderstorm Keg Leg Crew renown track is account-wide, so you can customize your character at any time without fear of having to restart progression on the track.\n\n\nThat's how to play the new Plunderstorm battle royale mode in World of Warcraft. It's actually a fun mode, so be sure to give it a shot!\n\nThe post How to play Plunderstorm in World of Warcraft appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Moss is a helpful resource in Stardew Valley for making items like the deluxe worm bin and mushroom log. However, it is initially challenging to spot, so you'll need to get your hands on this material before you can make them. Here's how to get moss in Stardew Valley.\n\n\nWhere to find moss in Stardew Valley\n\n\nYou can find moss on trees during any season other than Winter. However, only trees with a green mossy texture along their trunks have moss on them. Once you spot a mossy tree, hit it with an axe to get one to two moss out of it.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nMossy trees commonly spawn around the map, including in Cindersap and the Secret Forest. As you travel around Pelican Town, the quarry and various forests, you'll spot these trees everywhere, allowing you to farm moss quickly. \n\n\nHow to use moss in Stardew Valley\n\n\nYou'll use moss in multiple crafting recipes, including the deluxe worm bin and mushroom log. Creating the deluxe worm bin requires a regular version of this machine and 30 moss, and it allows you to get better bait for fishing. The mushroom log also needs moss alongside ten hardwood to make, allowing you to obtain mushrooms occasionally. Placing one near wild trees will make it more effective, so crafting some and putting them in tree-filled areas is worth crafting.\n\n\nYou can also use it to cook moss soup. One bowl of moss soup requires 20 moss, making it slightly expensive when you're just starting. Although the soup doesn't give any status effects, it restores 70 energy and 31 health, making it useful for cave exploration.\n\nThe post How to get moss in Stardew Valley 1.6 appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, before doing this, you'll have to find the tree, farm an uncommon resource, and build the neighbor's home. Here's how to find the Big Tree in Stardew Valley.\n\n\nWhere to find the Big Tree in Stardew Valley\n\n\nThe Big Tree is in Cindersap Forest, the region south of your farm, just before the entrance to the Secret Forest. Once you go south from your farm to the forest, you'll spot it to your left inside the fenced-in area.\n\n\nHowever, you can't do anything with its initial tree form. Instead, you can only interact with the Big Tree after encountering the \"strong wind storm\" event at night, after falling asleep. This night event causes the tree to fall and produce a large stump. You'll know it's ready when you find a question mark icon on the stump, indicating you can start its quest line. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nOnce you interact with the stump following the strong winds dialogue, you'll gain \"The Giant Stump\" quest, which asks you to get 100 hardwood. You can get hardwood around your farm and in the Secret Forest. Since you need 100, you may need a few in-game days to gather enough. Fortunately, there isn't a time limit for completing this, so you can collect the hardwood at your own pace. \n\n\nAfter gathering the wood and returning to the Big Tree's stump, you'll build a house on top and wait for someone to move in. After some time, you'll have a new neighbor to interact with.\n\nThe post How to find the Big Tree in Stardew Valley 1.6 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Books in Stardew Valley are a fantastic resource for increasing skill EXP and gaining permanent character buffs. However, finding them requires digging artifact spots for books or purchasing them from a bookseller. Here's how to find a bookseller in Stardew Valley.\n\n\nWhere is the Bookseller in Stardew Valley?\n\n\nThe bookseller is an NPC in Stardew Valley located on the northeast side of town, just north of the museum and JojaMart. Upon reaching JojaMart, you'll find a stairway leading directly to the bookseller. However, you can only access this vendor on days when the bookseller is visiting town, which you can check by looking for a notification in the bottom-left side of your screen or by checking your calendar for a blue hot air balloon icon.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nOnce you find the bookseller, you can purchase or trade in books. Buying books allows you to pay a one-time flat gold fee, ranging from a few thousand to over 25,000 gold. Although it's a hefty fee, the skill and perk benefits often outweigh this. Alternatively, you can trade in books in exchange for items. The items you use to exchange books include cooked dishes, rare items for valuable books, and materials like wood, coal, and bait for skill books.\n\n\nThe book options change each time the bookseller visits, with duplicates having a thumbs-up icon to avoid you buying them twice. The exception to this is skill books, which you can read repeatedly for multiple EXP boosts. If you read a skill book but have a maxed-out skill, you'll gain mastery points instead. In other words, you'll have to revisit the bookseller multiple times to get mastery quickly or unlock every book perk.\n\nThe post How to find the Bookseller in Stardew Valley 1.6 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Stardew Valley 1.6 introduced four new crops that, unlike most seeds, are not purchasable through Pierre's General Store. Each item is available in different seasons, with Powdermelon being an exclusive winter crop. Here's how to find Powdermelon in Stardew Valley.\n\n\nWhere to find Powdermelon seeds in Stardew Valley\n\n\nIn Stardew Valley, you can find Powdermelon seeds by digging grass tufts and artifact spots during Winter. Artifact spots drop artifacts and seeds, while grass spots have a much higher chance of giving seeds. These grass spots look similar to artifact dig spots, except they appear as grass flowing in the wind. You can dig both with a hoe to get one to two seeds.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nArtifact spots look like worms poking out of the ground, while grass tufts look like grass blowing in the wind. They appear randomly around the map, dropping one of the four new seed types. The grass spots pictured above both dropped Powdermelon seeds, while another grass tuft north of my farm that I found on the same day had a carrot seed. \n\n\nOnce you have your Powdermelon seeds, you can grow them after planting and watering the crop for seven in-game days during Winter. After seven days, they'll mature, allowing you to harvest them. Like most crops in Stardew Valley, you can use Powdermelon in a seed maker to produce more seeds, giving you a renewable way to get additional melons without running back to the forest or the wild. Alternatively, you can sell them for a base value of 60 gold, with farming level buffs and quality increasing this further.\n\nThe post How to get Powdermelon and Powdermelon Seeds in Stardew Valley 1.6 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "30 years ago, Success's shoot 'em up series Cotton made the leap from 2D side-scroller to Space Harrier-style rail shooter in Panorama Cotton. 24 years ago, Rainbow Cotton expanded upon that 3D flight of fancy on Dreamcast, and now it's finally making its way to the West. \n\n\nWhile Rainbow Cotton launched in Japan only on Dreamcast back in 2000, ININ Games recently announced plans to bring a remake to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC. Those spring 2024 plans were just narrowed down to a specific launch date of May 9, and ININ put together something special for the accompanying trailer. Rather than simply showing off Rainbow Cotton in all its updated glory, the new trailer serves up a brief guide to how the team brings retro games to modern audiences. \n\n\n\n\nThere tends to be a lot of discussion about where the line is between remaster and remake, and the video above does a good job of succinctly summing it up, at least in terms of how ININ Games handles it. They get into where emulation and ports fall in the mix of the Cotton re-releases, and why Rainbow Cotton deserves the distinction of a full remake.\n\n\nThe remake features upgraded graphics in full HD, updates to the user interface, lock-on targeting, a two-player mode. and other bells and whistles. Those who just want to play the original as it appeared on Dreamcast can do that, as well. ININ calls it \"as authentic as it can possibly be,\" so you'll just have to imagine you have your VMU plugged into your modern platform of choice. \n\nThe post Dreamcast shoot ’em up Rainbow Cotton finally makes western debut on May 9 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Microsoft's highly publicized acquisition of Blizzard has had wide-reaching effects, and while some of them have been quite awful, this month showcases one of the upsides. Diablo IV, one of Blizzard's big 2023 releases, comes to Xbox Game Pass late next week, on March 28. We enjoyed the game quite a bit at launch, calling it a \"massive and deeply engrossing action RPG,\" so if you've been waiting to check it out, now is a good time to do so.\nThis month also includes a trio of games built around cars, though the three are each very different. F1 23 simulates the realism and intensity of Formula 1 racing, Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 is an arcade racer full of child-like wonder, and Open Roads (which will launch on Game Pass) is a quieter, narrative-driven game about a mother and her daughter going on a road trip. Maybe they'll help me on my journey of learning how to drive.\nHere's the rest of the line-up:\nWhat's Coming To Game Pass This Month\nLightyear Frontier (Game Preview) (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) – Today\nMLB The Show 24 (Cloud and Console) – Today\nThe Quarry (Cloud and Console) – March 20 | Our Review\nEvil West (Cloud, Console, and PC) – March 21\nTerra Invicta (Game Preview) (PC) – March 26\nDiablo IV (Console and PC) – March 28 | Our Review\nHot Wheels Unleashed 2 – Turbocharged (Cloud, Console, and PC) – March 28 | Our Review\nOpen Roads (Cloud, Console, and PC) – March 28\nArk: Survival Ascended (Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X|S) – April 1\nF1 23 (Cloud) EA Play – April 2\nSuperhot: Mind Control Delete (Cloud, Console, and PC) – April 2 | Our Review\nWhat's Leaving Game Pass On March 31\nHot Wheels Unleashed (Cloud, Console, and PC) | Our Review\nInfinite Guitars (Cloud, Console, and PC) \nMLB The Show 23 (Cloud and Console) | Our Review",

The large 3,745-piece set is set to release on April 1 in LEGO stores and to those in the LEGO Insiders program. Everyone else can roll for initiative on snagging a set on April 4, for the price of $359.99.\nProduced through the popular LEGO Ideas platform, where fans are able to submit their own build concepts that are then refined and produced as official sets, the final set includes a full dungeon and tower, a tavern, and six minifigures (including an Orc Rogue, Gnome Fighter, Elf Wizard, and Dwarf Cleric). Builders also get several iconic D&D monsters, including an owlbear, beholder, displacer beast, and, of course, the red dragon Cinderhowl, who acts as the centerpiece of the set.\n\nInterestingly, LEGO is offering an actual D&D adventure book to LEGO Insiders as a free digital download or as a paperback book that can be purchased with 2,7000 Insider points. That same book will show up on D&D Beyond (Wizards of the Coast’s digital hub for D&D) complete with characters sheets and digital dice. Presumably, the idea is that you could play out the adventure with the included LEGO minifigs and monsters as the miniatures used on the table, which is a pretty slick way for dedicated players to capitalize on the completed build.\nIn addition to the larger set, LEGO also revealed plans for a full line of D&D-themed minifigures, launching in September 2024.\nWill you be checking out this crossover set?

I awarded it a 9.5 out of 10, writing in my review, “Balatro is an ingenious and entertaining roguelike and one of my favorite games of the year. Playing it has become a near-obsession; everything feels perfectly designed to encourage you to keep trying because that next run could be the run of your life.

I still can't grasp the response to this game, and I am overjoyed that so many people have been able to have fun with my silly creation.

The most recent entry, Garou: Mark of the Wolves, was released in 1999 for arcades (and 2001 for Dreamcast in the West), meaning the series has been dormant for over 25 years. Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves sees the series make its long-awaited return, and it already feels ready to stand alongside the big boys of the genre.\nI had a chance to play over an hour of City of the Wolves at the SNK World Championship Finals last weekend, where I also spoke with director Hayato Konya .

          "description": "No matter the industry – sports, television, movies, or games – the debate of \"the greatest of all time\" inevitably comes up. These debates are often full of superfluous apples-to-oranges comparisons and, as a result, are unlikely to come up with a definitive answer everyone will be happy with. But that's what makes them so fun. In that spirit, we're taking the month of March to hold our own bracket-style tournament, voted on by readers, to determine the greatest video game of all time.\nThough we here at Game Informer assembled the bracket, even that was heavily influenced by our Reader Vote we held in 2018 to coincide with our 300th issue. Using the results of our 2018 Reader Vote combined with some input from staff, general sentiment in various online communities, and critical reception for more recent games, we assembled a starting bracket of 64 games. From here, we'll hold two rounds of voting per week until we whittle this field down to one ultimate winner.\nWill this result in a definitive selection of the best game ever released? Or will it reveal a coordinated effort from a particular gaming community committed to seeing their favorite game rise through the ranks? Only time will tell. \nWhile this is meant to be a fun experiment to see how the results shake out within the Game Informer readership and community, we hope you'll come back to root for your favorites every Monday and Thursday until we are able to crown our champion in the 2024 Game Gauntlet. Be sure to bookmark this page or follow us on social media to be alerted when a new round starts! \nRegion 1\n \n\n\n\nRegion 2\n \n\n\n\nRegion 3\n \n\n\n\nRegion 4",

More specifically, developer Shared Memory, which is just solo dev Billy Basso, revealed in a new gameplay trailer the game will launch on May 9. \nDunkey revealed Big Mode, his own publishing arm, back in 2022, later announcing that Shared Memory's Animal Well would be the first game it publishes. Now, just shy of two years later, Animal Well will finally be in the hands of players in just a couple of months. \nCheck out the Animal Well release date trailer for yourself below: \n\n\n\"After nearly 7 years of development, Animal Well is finally almost ready to be released out into the world,\" Basso writes on X (formerly Twitter). \"I have made this trailer to commemorate the occasion. I hope you like it. I don't really know what else to say.\" \nAs you can see in the trailer above, Animal Well continues to look hauntingly gorgeous, and even kind of cute if you're a fan of spooky animals. We also get new glimpses of the game's metroidvania exploration, too, by way of a special yo-yo with a light that lures animals forward and more. Plus, there's a dog, which rules. \nAnimal Well hits PlayStation, Switch, and PC on May 9. \nAre you going to play Animal Well in May? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "Gameloft, the studio behind Disney Dreamlight Valley, has revealed it is partnering with Wizards of the Coast to create a new Dungeons & Dragons game. It's being developed for both consoles and PC and Gameloft describes it as an \"innovative hybrid of survival, life simulation, and action RPG.\"\nDisney Dreamlight Valley is popular in the life sim genre, mixing fun gameplay, unique customization, and Disney together into a package that players seem to really enjoy. It launched into Early Access back in 2022 before the full release debuted in December. All of this is to say: if you're a fan of Disney Dreamlight Valley and Dungeons & Dragons, there's a new game to keep an eye on. \nCurrently untitled, Gameloft says in its announcement on Instagram that the game is set in the mythical Forgotten Realms, which is also the D&D setting Baldur's Gate 3 takes place in. The game, which will mix survival, life simulation, and action RPG elements into one, will feature \"unique cooperative gameplay,\" the studio says. \n\"Players can expect an adventure where the rich lore of this legendary franchise meets real-time strategy in a unique campaign of resilience, camaraderie, and danger at nearly every turn,\" the announcement reads.\" \nThere's no name for the project and no release window either. Gameloft is currently hiring for the project. \nNews of this D&D game arrives roughly a year after Wizards of the Coast, which owns the D&D IP and is a division within Hasbro, reportedly canceled five unannounced games. The last D&D game released was Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance back in 2021 – read Game Informer's review of it here. \nAre you excited about this game? Let us know in the comments below!",

In spring, a Boss Rush will be released alongside even more outfits for Sargon, and in summer, the Divine Trials update brings new combat, platform, and puzzle challenges as well as new amulets, outfits, and more.

Coincidentally, that patch was centered on Terminids and nerfing spawn rates for Bile Titans and Chargers on the harder difficulties of Helldivers 2. Windows Central reports Shriekers only appear when a \"Shrieker Lair\" is one of the side objectives on a planet, noting they look like \"smaller versions of the mushroom-like Spore Towers that perpetually keep a large area around them covered in a thick haze.\" \n\n\nShrieker Lairs, like the Spore Towers and Terminid egg nests can be destroyed up close and from afar with a well-placed rocket, grenade, or strategem. \nKeep your eyes on the skies, Helldivers and remember...DEMOCRACY.\nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Helldivers 2 review, and then read about a recent patch that introduced meteor showers and fire tornadoes to the game.

The built-in speakers can now produce higher volume sound, which PlayStation says will allow players to hear in-game sounds and voice chat audio more clearly. Plus, the noise cancellation on the controller's built-in mic has been improved. \n\n\n\"The mic input quality on these controllers has been improved, courtesy of a new A.I. machine learning model,\" a PlayStation Blog post reads. \"Background noise from button presses and game audio are suppressed, resulting in a better voice chat experience.\"\nShare Screen is also getting some new features with today's update. Namely, viewers can move a pointer around and send a ping or draw a line on a shared screen, allowing them to highlight objects in-game or guide a player. Plus, viewers can now send emoji-based reactions to the host's screen – these features are turned off by default and the host and viewer must turn them on. PlayStation says these Share Screen features will hit the PS App, which also allows Share Screen, later this month. \nFinally, today's update allows users to adjust the brightness of the PS5 power indicator. Simply go to Settings, then Beep and Light, and then Brightness. \n\n\nFor more, read about the last big PS5 update that added Dolby Atmos, larger SSD capacity, and more to the console, and then check out this story about a retailer listing of a \"V2 DualSense\" with a 12-hour battery life.

          "description": "If you ask any Final Fantasy fan what their top five favorite songs in the franchise are, there's a 99 percent chance one of them is \"To Zanarkand\" from Final Fantasy X. However, it turns out, it wasn't originally intended for the game. \nThis news comes from Audrey (aitaikimochi on X, formerly Twitter), a mega Final Fantasy fan, Twitch streamer, and CEO of Aitai Japan Inc., who translated a recent interview between Weekly Ochiai and Final Fantasy X composer Nobuo Uematsu, whose credits also include One-Winged Angel and Aerith's Theme from Final Fantasy VII and so much more. In that interview, Uematsu revealed \"To Zanarkand\" originally began as a piece for a French flute player, meant to be played during a recital. \n\n\n\"'To Zanarkand' was actually not meant to be the theme for Final Fantasy X,\" Uematsu tells Weekly Ochiai, as translated by Audrey on X. \"There was a flute player from France who originally asked me to write a song for them to play during a recital. When I wrote the piece, I thought perhaps this sounded a bit too sad for a recital. So I set it aside for the time being. \n\"Sometime after, when I was making the score of Final Fantasy X, I was falling behind all the while the producers were hounding me. So since that flute piece was unused, I just kind of meekly handed it to them. They listened to it and said, 'Yes! This is brilliant!'\" \nIn retrospect, it's wild \"To Zanarkand\" wasn't originally composed by Uematsu for Final Fantasy X because it fits the game's themes so well, nailing the somber and sad tone present throughout Tidus and Yuna's journey in Spira. \nFor more about Final Fantasy music, read Game Informer's exclusive four-part series on composer Masayoshi Soken's score for last year's Final Fantasy XVI:\nPart 1: Creating The Prelude\nPart 2: The Victory Fanfare\nPart 3: Finding A Main Theme\nPart 4: The Sound\nAfter that, read Game Informer's review of Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster. \nWhat's your favorite Final Fantasy theme song?

This news comes from a recent notice to investors that explains board member Juergen Goeldner is taking over as interim CEO in the meantime, as reported by GameDeveloper. \nWhile Starbreeze's messaging around Sjögren's leave isn't super clear – the team simply says it is bidding farewell to the former CEO – today's news arrives after Payday 3 failed to meet expectations, according to GameDeveloper. \n\n\n\"On behalf of the board of directors, I would like to thank Tobias Sjögren for his achievements during the past three years,\" board chairman Torgny Hellström writes in the notice to investors. \"Tobias took over the helm of Starbreeze in a challenging phase of its journey and we wish him well in his future endeavors.\"\nGoeldner, the new interim CEO, adds, \"Starbreeze has a strong history of developing and publishing games globally. After launching Payday 3, the company is well-positioned to leverage the strengths of the organization to monetize and develop the IP portfolio. I am looking forward to assuming an operative position and, together with the management, ensure the execution of this strategy.\"\nGoeldner has 40 years of experience in the games industry, including several executive positions, according to the notice. His last executive position was as CEO of Focus Home Interactive. He has been a member of Starbreeze's board of directors since last year. Starbreeze has initiated a recruitment process for a permanent CEO. \n\n\nPayday 3 hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on September 21. We enjoyed the game around launch, giving it an 8 out of 10 in the Game Informer Payday 3 review. More than 3 million people played Payday 3 in its first month, but the game still failed to meet the expectations of the studio. \n[Source: GameDeveloper]\nAre you still playing Payday 3?

          "description": "MultiVersus, the Warner Bros. free-to-play crossover platform fighter, makes its big comeback on May 28. The game has been rebuilt and returns almost a year after its open beta was taken offline.\nPlayer First Games game director Tony Huynh explains in a developer diary that MultiVersus has been remade from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5, meaning it sports improved visuals and lighting. It also has a totally revamped netcode to provide what Huynh promises will be consistent online performance regardless of platform.\nEvery existing fighter sports new attacks and combat mechanics, and Huynh promises that new fighters are on the way. Additionally, new stages were teased with concept art depicting arenas based on The Powerpuff Girls’ Townsville and Dexter’s Laboratory.\nLastly, Huynh reveals a brand-new PvE mode is coming to the game. He doesn’t go into detail, only teasing it will offer “additional ways of playing with unique rewards.” \n\n\nMultiVersus was first launched in open beta last May and pits characters across Warner Bros. stable of IPs, such as DC, Looney Tunes, and even Game of Thrones, in a tag-team-focused twist of Super Smash Bros. inspired combat. The game was initially quite popular and generally well-liked. Writer Bryan Vore gave the game’s beta incarnation an 8 out of 10 in our review, writing that “Living games have the potential to go in frustrating directions, but MultiVersus has a strong foundation. If it can meaningfully roll out content and smooth out its rough edges, this could become a new crossover obsession for years to come.” \nUnfortunately, months of infrequent updates and lack of communication following the game’s second season saw engagement decline. Player First Games pulled MultiVersus from stores to address these criticisms. When the game returns, it will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.\nAre you looking forward to jumping back into the new and improved MultiVersus?

However, during last September's Nintendo Direct, we learned that this well-liked sequel is making the leap to Switch as Luigi's Mansion 2 HD, joining the third entry in the hybrid console's catalog. Today, Nintendo announced that Luigi and his Poltergust 5000 will return to Switch in June.\nWhen it arrived on 3DS in 2013, it received strong review scores, including an 8.5 from Game Informer. This sequel actually involves the younger Mario Bro visiting a series of mansions to capture ghosts and rescue Mario from King Boo. You can see the reveal trailer for Luigi's Mansion 2 HD below.\n\n\nLuigi's Mansion 2 HD arrives on Nintendo Switch on June 27. If you just can't wait to bust ghosts as Mario's brother, be sure to check out Luigi's Mansion 3, which is perhaps one of the most underrated first-party games on Switch. You can read our review of Luigi's Mansion 3 here.",

          "description": "Coming off last year's overwhelming success of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Nintendo and Illumination have announced that work has begun on a second movie set in the world of Super Mario Bros. The announcement, made by Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto and Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri, states that this film will arrive in theaters in the United States on April 3, 2026.\nWhile the announcement stops short of calling this \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" or even referring to it as a sequel, Miyamoto confirms that Nintendo and Illumination are working together on this one, and the director duo of the first film, Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, are returning. \"As for the details of the new movie, as I often say, we'll let you know once we're at the stage where we're ready to share more,\" Miyamoto said in the announcement video posted on Nintendo of America's YouTube channel. \"This time, we're thinking about broadening Mario's world further and it'll have a bright and fun story. We hope you'll look forward to it!\"\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie stars Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Day, Jack Black, Keegan-Michael Key, and Seth Rogen. Nintendo and Illumination have yet to confirm any of the cast of this new film set in the Super Mario Bros. world. The Super Mario Bros. Movie arrived in theaters on April 5, 2023 to positive fan and critic reception, and earned a place among the highest-grossing films of all time. The new film set in this same world is set to arrive almost exactly three years later on April 3, 2026.\nWhat do you want to see from a new Super Mario Bros. animated movie? Do you think it'll be another wide cast film? Or will it zero in on a specific subset of characters, like a Luigi's Mansion or Donkey Kong Country movie?",

With more than 12 million monthly visits, Vumoo was one of the more popular piracy portals. The site was presumably being operated from Vietnam, where many of the largest pirate sites and services still reside today. \nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

In Brazil, a deal between MPA and ANCINE was effectively torn up for allegedly prioritizing U.S. content over that produced locally in Brazil. \nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

          "description": "For the 17th time, ScummVM has again been accepted for the Google Summer of Code program this summer.\nThe program intends to bring new contributors into open source projects. In the most recent two years this has included both students and non-students as eligible candidates for participation.\nLike last year, participants can apply for working on either short tasks (about 175 hours of work), or large tasks (about 350 hours of work). The coding period typically runs from start of June through August, but there is some flexibility which allows participants to have longer time frames if they are unable to work full time through the summer.\nScummVM is looking for people interested in participating in GSoC with us. A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we are also open to your own ideas as well. Please provide the required information in your application before submitting.\nWe also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server, in the #scummvm-gsoc channel. This allows you to engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, to get advice about how to get involved with the project, as well as writing your application.\nBased on our previous 16 years of experience with GSoC, we have put together a Google Summer of Code miniportal to help you get started.\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\n>",

Exactly 21 years ago, I received an ICQ message (look it up, kids) out of the blue from a guy named Ludvig Strigeus (nicknamed Ludde). “Hello, you probably don’t know me, but I’ve been working on a project to clone TTD for a while.” he said, more or less. He didn’t want to release this to the public yet, and wasn’t entirely sure what he was going to do with it. (He’d been working on it since 30th June 2002, so I guess that is technically the birthday of what would become OpenTTD…) Ludde sent me a copy of what he’d been working on, and it was very exciting indeed. It was a fully functional version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, written in C. Admittedly incomplete at that time, it was still quite remarkable.",
