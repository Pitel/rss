We had various small updates previously of course, adding new events, items and themes, but today's arrival was far more substantial. In addition to new characters, locations and features, it seems to have added a lot of items.\nDatamining results shared on animalcrossingworld.com suggest the number of new items could be as high as 9000+. That's crazy, but the number is currently being reviewed and debated, as it also depends on whether you count clones and new colour variations of existing items.

It's since become something of a cult object in the world of gaming, inspiring adoration with older gamers (as well as a feature-length documentary), but this much-maligned peripheral is getting another chance of movie fame thanks to HBO's upcoming festive flick, 8-Bit Christmas.\nSet in the late '80s, the film tells the quest of one boy to get a Nintendo Entertainment System, the hottest item with any self-respecting child.

The last mainline entry in the series was released over eight years ago for the 3DS, while the last home console entry was another ten years before that. Moreover, Shin Megami Tensei V was one of the first games ever revealed for the Switch, mere months after the console itself was first shown to the public. All those years of hype have thus generated some awfully high expectations. It was never in doubt that Atlus would give this release the attention it deserves, but the question has always been whether it would be good enough to get over the high bar set by its predecessors. Fortunately, any such concerns can be cast aside — Shin Megami Tensei V is the best entry in the series yet and stands as an impressive achievement for a beloved franchise.\nRight from the off, it’s made abundantly clear that Shin Megami Tensei V is every bit as ‘heavy’ as its predecessors. Things start off seemingly normal as you follow your character through a typical day of school, but there’s an ominous tone to the announcement at the end of the day that advises students to travel home in pairs. People have been disappearing and there are rumors of violent attacks taking place around Tokyo, but nobody really seems to have a clear idea of what exactly is going on.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Duguet believes that the technology \"will enable more play-to-earn that will enable more players to actually earn content, own content, and we think it's going to grow the industry quite a lot\".\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Call Of Duty: Vanguard continues this trend in a big way, with 27 primary and 9 secondary weapons that you can unlock, customise, and experiment with.\nWe fully expect Call Of Duty: Vanguard's weapon meta to evolve quickly with future updates and balance patches, but at the moment there is definitely a top tier of guns which have risen above the rest in effectiveness. Below we'll walk you through the very best guns in the game and how to get the most power out of each one.\nRead more",

Now, Amazon Games are bringing its flashy, Diablo-like combat to the west in the form of a closed beta later today, and we've had an early sneak peek at it. Of course, what with Amazon's own MMO New World now settling into its third month, not to mention Final Fantasy 14's Endwalker expansion looming on the horizon, Lost Ark arrives at a busy time for fervent EXP grinders. The big question, then, is whether Lost Ark’s Diablo-y formula can do enough to compete with the already well-established MMO juggernauts.

Led by this, the Intel Core i9-12900K, Alder Lake sees the adoption of a hybrid architecture that combines high-power Performance cores (P-cores) with Efficiency cores (E-cores) that can free up headroom by taking on background tasks. The Core i9-12900K takes this opportunity to bulk up, combining eight P-cores and E-cores apiece for a total of 16 cores and 24 threads.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Ever since AMD’s Ryzen chips appeared with an alluring balance of gaming speed, desktop multitasking performance, efficiency, and affordability, Intel seemed to sink into a comfort zone of simply raising clock speeds and maybe adding a few cores. \r\n\n\r\nThis was often enough to earn some half-throated recommendations for gaming builds specifically, but this past year proved that something needed to change, with the AMD Ryzen 5 5600X claiming the best gaming CPU title and 11th Gen Rocket Lake Intel chips – like the 5600X’s rival Core i5-11600K – looking thoroughly skippable. For those who did decide to wait until the 12th Gen Alder Lake launch, consider yourselves vindicated, as the Core i5-12600K is a great all-rounder: both a Ryzen-beater in games and, thanks to a long-overdue architecture revamp, a drastically better general purpose processor.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Even though I’ve been dead excited about Weird West since its announcement last summer, when the time finally came for me to play a preview build last week, I found myself unusually hesitant. Primarily, this was because I loved the game’s concept so much (“What if Dishonored and Desperadoes III had a rooting tooting baby, then let it watch way too many horror movies?”), that I didn’t really want to face the possibility that developers WolfEye Studios might have fallen short on it. But more than that, I was worried I’d have to… well, make an effort.\r\n\n\r\nFor whatever reason, my enthusiasm to start new games has been taking one of its periodic dips over the last month or so, leaving me in the comforting arms of old favourites I can play on autopilot. Time and time again, I’ll get right to the point of hitting play on something, before convincing myself - completely unreasonably - that it’ll probably be a load of hassle for moderate reward. And however promising a sprawling, top-down immersive sim set in a world of haunted stetsons sounded, I was certain it would involve a lot of fiddling about with inventories, reading long screeds of text, and going on sidequests.\r\n\n\r\nI’m delighted to say, however, that I was completely wrong. Because while Weird West does involve all those things (and features even more emergent complexity than the hefty dose I’d anticipated, to boot) I have not had a smoother time getting into a game in a long while. The build I played only featured one of the game’s five character campaigns, admittedly. But unless the other four are all set in a Tesco car park or something, I can heartily recommend it to you.\r\n \nRead more",

There are hay people hunting you in the night, monstrous masks inspired by traditional Swiss carnival costumes, and the decapitated head of the goat Allegria, bleating and chattering from your backpack. \r\n\n\r\nMany horror games either try to establish a sense of mundane familiarity in a recognisable, contemporary world before shattering that familiarity, or else rely on the dusty, done-to-death setting of haunted manors. In most cases, neither approach does much to surprise. Horror often relies on the grotesque, but Mundaun’s weirdness is different. It is an earthy kind of weirdness, a strangeness with roots so deep that it might be confused with familiarity. It’s a horror that smells not of blood, but of hay and dung, snow and soot. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Yes, it is named after the metaverse, because tech megacorps can't resist the delusion that their platform to sell adverts is elevating humanity to a new plane of existence. Mark Zuckerberg suggests that in the future they're building, you'll experience everything through virtual and augmented reality, and that definitely won't be a horrible world devoid of intimacy, okay, it'll be great.\nRead more",

He immediately follows this up by telling me a friend of his had nightmares because of the menacing figure you play cards against, so yeah, maybe it's a bit horror-like. But I kind of understand his point. \r\n\n\r\nAt the start, Inscryption is like a hostage situation, where you're forced to play a card-based roguelike against a sinister games master. Then, just as you start getting the hang of things, the game evolves into something way more complex. If you've played Mullins' other games you'll know his work can go to some weird, meta places. I won't say more above the cut, because I'd hate to spoil it.

They feature stats like time played, checkpoints cleared, that sort of thing. Many people don't seem to like this, which I totally understand.

Players control the titular boy, with the help of his shape-shifting blob companion, to solve 2D platforming puzzles.

Codenamed Volt, this game had reportedly gone through multiple iterations since first being conceived but ultimately, what led to its cancellation was the repeated “reboots, technological hiccups, and challenges caused by COVID-19,” Bloomberg reports. \nVolt’s development began in 2017, and it was set to be centered around various superheroes competing against each other. It would have featured an emphasis on online gameplay. \n“It was set to be a new intellectual property for Hangar 13, but 2K executives didn’t see it as a worthwhile investment because of the amount of time needed in development before it became a finished product,” Bloomberg’s report reads. \nThere have been no layoffs as a result of this at the time of this writing, and Bloomberg reports that Hangar 13 employees will meet Thursday in Novata, California, where the studio is based, to discuss what happens next. \nBloomberg writer Jason Schreier, who wrote this report, tweeted out additional details about the canceled project and those affected. He said Hangar 13 staff in California learned today via email that Volt was canceled, and he also noted that some non-US staff members learned of this news from his report. \nSchreier also said this canceled game was not Mafia 4, which some thought Hangar 13 was developing according to rumors. He said Mafia 4 rumors “were always false, aside from their early attempts in 2016-2017.” \n[Source: Bloomberg]\nWhat do you want to see Hangar 13 develop next? Let us know in the comments below!",

As expected, it sold out immediately. \nAs far as special editions of Halo Infinite goes, there’s the Halo Infinite Xbox Series X bundle, the special steelbook that comes with preorders in select locations, and that’s about it. Before today, we hadn’t yet seen a special Halo Infinite edition that comes with what’s usually expected i.e. a statue of some kind, maybe some patches or stickers, and an art book. \nIt seems Walmart had the lock on that because overnight, it released the Halo Infinite Collector’s Edition for $169.99. It sold out near immediately. It features the game, of course, a steelbook case (the same one being sold by other retailers), a set of five patches, a Plasma Pistol replica bottle opener, an Energy Sword desk lamp, two lanyards, a mini art book, a desktop portfolio, and a special developer note. \nAccording to Walmart, this edition was limited to just 10,000 units and now, it’s sold out. It’s unclear if more Collector’s Editions will be released. It’s also important to note that oddly enough, neither Microsoft nor Xbox have mentioned this edition yet. \nPerhaps it’s an unofficial one made by Walmart, although that would be odd considering it comes with some very official-looking merchandise. Maybe Walmart jumped the gun and released it early. All we know is that we’re very sad we were sleeping while this went live. \nFor more about Halo Infinite, check out this story about Craig the Brute’s glow-up of the year and then read about how 343 Industries used Halo 3 and Halo Reach as inspiration for Infinite’s character and enemy design.

It will have live-service components, a global launch, and locales and a narrative based on or at least inspired by Chinese mythology. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nThe new trailer, which launched over the weekend, features a gorgeous and flashy open world significantly more open than that seen in Honor of Kings...which makes sense considering Honor of Kings: World is meant to be an open world title.

Tencent originally wanted to make a mobile version of League of Legends, but Riot Games passed on it and so Honor of Kings was made by TiMi Studio instead. \nSimilar to Genshin Impact, World appears to be a third-person action-RPG set in a fantastical world filled with different towns and cities, NPCs, enemies, and more. A release date for World has not been announced, but a worldwide launch is planned for multiple platforms, presumably PlayStation, Xbox, mobile, and PC platforms. \nWhile waiting to learn more about Honor of Kings: World, check out our thoughts on Genshin Impact in Game Informer’s Genshin Impact review and then read about how it's celebrating its first anniversary.

Developer FJRD Interactive announced today that the game will officially launch on November 10 for PC.\nAmong Trees was first revealed during The Game Awards in 2018 and launched in Early Access in June 2020. Set in a scenic, living forest, your task is to gather materials and food to survive. You’ll chop down trees to build a cabin, which you can upgrade by adding new rooms to unlock cooking, crafting, sewing, and gardening. Speaking of that last mechanic, you can construct an entire greenhouse to grow food to consume raw or use as ingredients for recipes. You can also build a hydration system and even a brewery. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nThe gorgeous world includes forests and caves. As peaceful as it looks, it’s not without its dangers. Predators such as bears roam its landscape, which you’ll need to avoid to prevent a The Revenant situation. If that’s too much excitement for your blood, a peaceful Zen mode allows you to enjoy Among Trees’ laid-back vibe without killer animals breathing down your neck. On the friendlier side, you can adopt and train a fox companion to help you locate valuable resources. \nFJRD says it plans to continue bug fixing throughout the year. Other than that, don’t expect any new significant features or content. After spending five years working on Among Trees, the team is excited for it to go 1.0 and begin transitioning to other projects. \nAmong Trees will be available on Steam and the Epic Games Store for $14.99.",

The downside: the shoe wasn’t for sale and could only be won in a contest. Fortunately for gamers and sneakerheads, the two companies are at it again, creating another console-inspired sneaker that you can purchase the old-fashioned way. \nDubbed the Xbox 360 Forum Mid, the shoe draws aesthetic inspiration from, you guessed it, the Xbox 360. Like the original version of the console, the sneaker sports a predominantly white look with silver and lime-green accents. Eagle-eyed fans will notice the strap resembles the 360’s disc tray. The heel has elements referencing the removable hard drive and memory unit slots. These easter eggs are largely subtle; the Xbox button on the sides of the shoe is the only dead giveaway you’re wearing a console on your feet. The sneaker also comes with four extra laces in red, yellow, green, and blue. I’m sure you can guess the significance of those colors. \nClick image thumbnails to view larger version\n \n                                                                                                             \n\nThe Xbox 360 Forum Mid is a limited edition release.

Sol Cresta will follow in the footsteps of previous Cresta games in that it will feature spaceships flying through galaxies, taking out enemies, and more in classic vertical-shooter arcade fashion. It will also allow players to dock with allies, just like the original games did nearly 40 years ago. \nAt the time of Sol Cresta’s announcement back in August, Kamiya said “we want to make all kinds of games...not just action games.” Platinum Games is perhaps best known for what it does on the action side of gaming – Nier Automata, Astral Chain, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, to name a few – but it seems the studio is using Sol Cresta to prove it can do vertical shooters, too. \nAs noted by Eurogamer, Kamiya’s stream featured gameplay of Sol Cresta’s new Caravan Mode, which is a five-minute score attack mode.

How to Say Goodbye, an enchanting puzzle game from one of the minds of Monument Valley 2, finds an adorable, perhaps more palatable avenue for accepting loss. \nPlayers explore a world filled with spirits as the ghost of a recently departed person. According to publisher Arte France, the goal is to escape the “liminal space between life and death in which they are trapped.” That means sliding the floor and surrounding decor to guide the ghost through tricky environments to an exit. The grid-based areas allow horizontal and vertical movement, but you’ll also have to contend with dark spirits hindering your paths. Since many of the spirits are still grappling with the reality of their demise, escaping symbolizes the acceptance of your death by allowing yourself to move on. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nHow to Say Goodbye Comes from Florian Veltman, formerly a designer on Monument Valley 2 and Assemble with Care, and Baptiste Portefaix, an award-winning sound designer and composer. The game’s art direction draws inspiration from illustrated children’s books such as The Moomins, The Little Prince, and Where The Wild Things Are. How to Say Goodbye arrives sometime in 2022 for PC and Mac.\nWhat do you think of How to Say Goodbye?
