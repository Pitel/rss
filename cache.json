          "description": "Solo developer Billy Basso's enigmatic Metroidvania Animal Well has been dated for May 9th, publishers Bigmode announced yesterday. In it, you'll explore a vast labyrinth of tunnels, solve puzzles and escape its many mammalian-based horrors, all of whom  are out to gobble you up in one fell swoop - though as a strange, tiny little blob creature the size of a chicken nugget, it's unclear both what you are, and why exactly you're so appetising to them. Well, it probably has something to do with looking like a sentient chicken nugget, I suppose. Come and watch the release date trailer below. \nRead more",

I've only seen three of them so far, out of its total of eight, but it's immediately obvious just how much of a step-up these places are compared to the dusty plains and rolling hills of the most recent Final Fantasy game to hit PC, FF15. An obvious take, perhaps, given that FF15 first came out eight years ago in 2016, but I'm sure anyone (all right, mainly me) who's ever despaired at Noctis' seeming inability to climb even the smallest hillock in front of him, or how everyone always rides right into your backside while gunning about on a chocobo, will feel some m…",

In Death Of A Wish, combat has substance: it's a form of redemptive self-expression. The game's fights are a means of asserting and cherishing yourself in the face of a world that regards you as a deviant, a world whose poison you carry on the inside. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Either way, when I’m done, I’ll put the day’s harvest into the processing machines to work while I’m away, and then go exploring for minerals.\nMy goals are clear. I need to build a new machine, or upgrade my mech so that I can clean up a new area of the map and get new resources in return. Those will – you guessed it – let me build new machines or upgrade my mech again. There might be a few steps to juggle on the way, but nothing that needs me to hold long recipe flowcharts in my head.

As with the Arc Thrower stratagem, the lightning shotgun fires arcs of electricity that conduct between players and enemies alike, but there's a fresh armour perk, Electrical Conduit, which reduces arc damage by 95%, allowing close-knit teams of Helldivers to roll around the battlefield frazzling themselves without much penalty. \nStill, I think the real star pick here is surely the Localization Confusion booster, which extends the time between enemy spawns, allowing weirdo solo players such as myself to disentangle from a dragged-out gunfight a little more gracefully.\nRead more",

          "description": "Cast your eye over the original Outcast from 1999 today, and you'll find a world that's more abstract than alien. Hazy, almost block colour textures are stretched to breaking point over terrain that looks like it's been pulled and poked by a child sculpting in putty slime, while its cast of beige, three-fingered Talans are so rigid that they'd all be reigning champions at the local robot dance-off. Understandable, given the era in which is was made, but even so - what a difference 25 years make. Even after 2017's remake glow-up with Outcast: Second Contact, A New Beginning's version of Adelpha is a lush and verdant paradise, with treetops soaring over your head, and mountains requiring several triple or quadruple jetpack jumps to traverse. It's no Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora, admittedly, but it leans in very much the same direction, punching your eyeballs with such bright, primary colours that you'll feel enticed to explore every inch of it.\nA shame, then, that all its visual splendour amounts to is little more than an empty husk filled with open world busy work that already felt tired and done ten years ago. Its non-linear approach to storytelling remains intact, letting you tackle the quests and problems of its numerous village settlements in any order you wish, but even this has been boiled down to tedious checklists of fetch quests, escort missions and shooting up the same identikit facility one after another. Topping off this fatal combo is returning protagonist Cutter Slade, whose macho army dude dial is still set firmly to cringey wise-cracking and patronising stereotypes. A new beginning this ain't.\nRead more",

It's easily slid into one of my favourite games of the year without question, and presumably, for the hundreds of thousands of others who've also opted into preserving democracy.\nBut there seems to be this sentiment that Helldivers 2's roaring success has come as a shock, so much of a shock that top execs and investors are doing YouTube thumbnail faces in boardrooms with mini-nuke explosions erupting from their heads.

But it turned out that the critical perspective was something Nemati appreciated, and so we had a chat that dug down into the meat of it all.

And then you have games like Ereban: Shadow Legacy, which has just been given a release date - 10th April. In this mystical third-person stealth-platformer, your character can literally disintegrate and travel through shadows as a ripple of dark energy - a transformation that puts me in mind less of Thief than of squid-mode in Nintendo's Splatoon. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Unless you’re a long-term fan of his work, you might have asked that upon hearing about Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story, the latest interactive documentary from Digital Eclipse (following on from The Making Of Karateka and Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration). You might have heard Minter’s name in connection with the remake of the unreleased Atari arcade game Akka Arrh in 2023. Maybe you played his mind-warping shooter Polybius in VR. You might remember as far back as the Atari Jaguar and Minter’s phenomenal Tempest 2000, the unexpected highlight of the console’s library. Or perhaps you recall his work from the 8-bit glory days. You could just know him from the daily videos of him feeding his sheep on YouTube.\r\n\n\r\nThe point is that Jeff Minter has been making games for a phenomenally long time – more than 40 years, in fact. And in all that time, he has stayed true to what he believes in. “One of the things we say in the game itself is the idea of him being the last indie developer,” says Chris Kohler, editorial director at Digital Eclipse in California. “The last of the people from the early 80s who very consciously never sold out, never took the money, never looked to expand or do anything other than [be] just Jeff at his computer, making the sorts of video games that he wants to make.”\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's just designed in an \"agnostic\", systems-first way and this in itself makes stealth a possibility. It's also a quiet attempt to capture something of the intricacy of a full-blown military simulator, while still being a very \"arcadey\" game at heart, which owes a little to Arrowhead's own collective time in the military.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Cline, who you will remember is the writer of Ready Player One, is apparently one of the co-founders of Readyverse, and I'm sad to see he's still in search of a second idea. Open (that's the name of the game, but it's in all caps in their press assets) is an \"immersive multiverse filled with nostalgia-infused biomes featuring characters and cultural legends across iconic franchises\", coming to early access this year.

I don't know how White Wolf's RPG is viewed in the land of table tops these days, but here in computerville it has delivered exactly one good video game in the last 25 years (and don't come gibbering to me about 2022's Swansong, it wasn't fit to polish Bloodlines' fangs). Sure, Bloodlines 2 might prove a winner, but given years of delays and a developer change, I'll believe it when I see it.\nWhich brings us to Vampire: The Masquerade - Justice, the beleaguered series' first prowl through the rain-slick streets of VR. In theory, this should be exactly my cup of haemoglobin; a gothic, linear stealth game where you use your vampire powers to sneak across the rooftops of Venice. In its mechanics and design, Justice aspires to be a cut down version of Dishonored. Unfortunately, it's in the cutting down where most of its problems arise. It's too cramped, too basic, and too fuzzy around the edges, and the whole experience ends up being a bit mid.\nRead more",

Is Dune appropriative? Is the appropriation the point? Whatever the case, Funcom want you to know that their upcoming survival game Dune: Awakening has nothing to do with any of that, posting a short Xeet from the official Awakening account that's the written equivalent of sticking your arms straight out, waving your hands, and going \"Woahwoahwoah, hang on a minute.\"\n\"We agree that religion is an integral part of the Dune universe. This is why in Dune: Awakening you will meet and interact with people of different religions along your journey. However, as opposed to the story presented in the books, the player is not a messiah and will not play a major role in any of them. Leading people on a holy war is not why you arrive on Arrakis,\" reads the post in full. Personally, I approve of this effort to keep games apolitical. Politics? In my Dune. No thank you.

EA has made these classics and more, and for some reason The Saboteur, available on Steam for the first time. You can see the full list of games here. I don't have anything specific against The Saboteur, but I do think it's very funny that the list goes, like, \"beloved game from the 90s, beloved game from the 90s, 7/10 action game from 2009, beloved game from the 90s\". Also, I can take the opportunity to make fun of Graham and James, the tallest wrongest boys at RPS, who apparently both liked it.\nRead more",

          "description": "Dragon's Dogma series director Hideaki Itsuno has announced that the meat you can cook over campfires in Dragon's Dogma 2 is, in fact, \"real meat\". There's been a certain amount of PlayStation-instigated speculation about whether the meat is CGI-generated, following the last round of Dragon's Dogma 2 previews. Speaking to Japanese site 4Gamer, as translated by Automaton, Itsuno revealed that the game's scenes of sizzling flesh are derived from live action film of steaks being grilled - partly for the sake of authenticity, and partly to save money versus creating computer models of meat products. You can cook several types of meat in Dragon's Dogma, each of which has its own cutscene, and a number of Dragon's Dogmatists are already performatively salivating at the prospect on social media.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Towards the conclusion, one NPC is selected as \"Beloved\" and promptly abducted by a dragon for you to quest forth and rescue. There are a few characters who are positioned more obviously as romanceables, but the brilliance of the system is that you can raise your Affinity with pretty much anybody. If you want to finish the game staring passionately into the eyes of the court jester or that hearty bloke who runs the armour shop, it's within your power.\r\n \nRead more",

I may be doing this out of respect, or, perhaps, as an attempt to get something for me in the will — you will never find out.\n\n\nWhat you may have already found out, however, is that many have complained that the life of the PS5 seems to parallel the early years of the PS3, with a sore lack of games.

As part of the event you can earn daily login rewards, partake in exclusive event-oriented game modes, and more.  But when does the Dead by Daylight Blood Moon event end? Here's what we know.\n\n\n\n\nDead by Daylight Blood Moon event end date\n\n\nThe Dead by Daylight Blood Moon event ends on March 31, 2024. The event started on March 18, 2024, meaning it will last for almost two weeks in total. Even though Blood-related events are common in Dead by Daylight, this is the first ever actual Blood Moon event, so there's no telling if it will return.\n\n\nWhat should you do before Blood Moon event ends\n\n\nThere are several event-specific rewards that are only obtainable during the Blood Moon event, so you should try to get them before the event ends. The Blood Moon event rewards are:\n\n\n\nElodie Rakoto — Catacomb Exploration outfit\n\n\nThe Oni — Red Mist outfit\n\n\nUniversal Charm: Blood Basin\n\n\nUniversal Charm: Dripping Skulls\n\n\nUniversal Badge: Blood Basin\n\n\nUniversal Banner: Bubbling Blood\n\n\nUniversal Banner: Blood Web\n\n\n\nAs you complete event-specific challenges on the codex you will receive Thrombotic Trinkets. You can then use these Thrombotic Trinkets to acquire all the above rewards, which you should do before the event ends. Once the event ends you will not be able to acquire anymore Thrombotic Trinkets and obtain the limited-time rewards.\n\n\nThere are also four Event-specific store items that are only purchasable during the event which are:\n\n\n\nAce Visconti — Gambler's Rush outfit\n\n\nMikaela Reid — Blood Magic outfit\n\n\nThe Doctor — Blood Shock outfit\n\n\nThe Skull Merchant — Scarlet Vengeance outfit\n\n\n\nIf there are any rewards that you are interested in, make sure you grab them before March 31, 2024 when the Dead by Daylight Blood Moon event ends.\n\nThe post When does Dead by Daylight Blood Moon event end? appeared first on Destructoid.",

This time, he’s confirmed the addition of a new farm type, to the surprise of no one, but it now has a name — Meadowlands Farm. \n\n\nIf nothing else will convince you to begin a new save file to enjoy everything 1.6 offers, perhaps a new farm type with blue grass and beloved by animals will. \n\n\n\n\nAccording to the small image that ConcernedApe shared, Meadowlands Farm comes complete with ‘chewy blue grass that animals love’, leaving some in the comments to speculate whether this means produce quality increases will be accelerated due to happier animals. \n\n\nPerhaps more excitingly, Meadowlands Farm will come with a coop and two Chickens from the offset, meaning you can immediately begin caring for them in order to get their eggs. Perhaps this goes hand-in-hand with yesterday’s update about drinking Mayonnaise, but I don’t want to think about that. \n\n\nStardew Valley 1.6 is set to be released tomorrow, March 19, so this is likely to be the last teaser we get from ConcernedApe before we can all play ourselves. With that said, here’s everything we know about 1.6 ahead of its release:\n\n\n\nFruit Trees will yield Saplings of the same fruit\n\n\nHarvesting will be at the same speed in either direction\n\n\nLarger area of effect for downward Melee attacks\n\n\nMoving past pets will now take less time\n\n\nSpouses will now have a seven day ‘Honeymoon Period’ in the week after the wedding\n\n\nJelly, Pickles, Wines and Juices will now reflect the color of their main ingredient\n\n\nWe will be able to drink Mayonnaise\n\n\nThe post The final Stardew Valley 1.6 sneak peek confirms new Meadowlands Farm type appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "With the Stardew Valley 1.6 update less than a day away, you might be wondering whether your favorite mods will still be usable after the patch drops. Well, you’re in luck because ConcernedApe has shared the details about what is and isn’t updated.\n\n\nEven if your favorite mods aren’t quite compatible with 1.6 just yet, rest assured; the developer has thought of that, too. While he does encourage players to try out 1.6 minus the mods, he has added a public Steam branch that enables you to keep your mods by playing the game as it is now, on version 1.56. \n\n\nWill update 1.6 break mods?\n\n\nAccording to the list shared by ConcernedApe, the likelihood is that 1.6 won’t break most mods that you’ve got installed. \n\n\nThe list is long, and I mean long, long, so I won’t be listing absolutely everything here. If you want to see if your preferred mods will be compatible after the March 19 update, visit the SMAPI page. Here, you can search for your mods and find out whether they’re compatible. \n\n\nThat said, here’s a brief list of the most popular mods that have been updated to be compatible after patch 1.6:\n\n\n\nSMAPI\n\n\nStardew Valley Expanded\n\n\nContent Patcher\n\n\nNPC Map Locations\n\n\nChests Anywhere\n\n\nCJB Cheats Menu\n\n\nLookup Anything\n\n\nFarm Type Manager\n\n\nTractor Mod\n\n\nAutomate\n\n\n\n\n\nThe list goes on and on, but the majority of the most popular available mods appear to have been updated in time to seamlessly apply after 1.6 goes live. This list also enables you to see which mods are no longer maintained, while also offering alternatives, which is a nice touch. \n\nThe post Stardew Valley Update 1.6 includes long list of mods ready for patch day appeared first on Destructoid.",

The latest of these sneak peaks, posted on March 17, has me feeling confused. And concerned. \n\n\n\n\nYes, that’s right. Players of Stardew Valley can now partake in a lovely, thirst quenching drink of… mayonnaise. \n\n\nNow, I’m not sure about you but I’ve never once thought “I love this game, but do you know what would make it better? A lovely cold glass of mayonnaise”, but apparently there are some players who, for reasons I cannot fathom, are actually excited by this prospect. \n\n\nWith comments stating everything from “the moment we’ve been waiting for” to “does this mean I can drink Pickle Juice now too?”, I have some questions that I don’t particularly want answers for. \n\n\nPrior to this Tweet appearing, players were growing concerned due to the lack of updates, prompting them to ask ConcernedApe if he’d forgotten to post, or even if he was okay. Overall, yesterday was a pretty strange day on Twitter for Stardew Valley fans.\n\n\nWhat changed, ConcernedApe?\n\n\nBack in 2021, ConcernedApe replied to a Tweet saying the following which, in light of this most recent 1.6 reveal, has me wondering what happened between then and now to get us to this point:\n\n\n\n\nWell, regardless of how bizarre this latest update is, we’ve got one more sneak peak of 1.6 before it goes live at some time on March 19.

          "description": "This is getting a bit weird now. Two weeks ago, Steam broke its concurrent player record, registering 34.6 million users. One week later, it broke through that number, logging over 35 million players using the platform at the same time. Seven days later, it's gone and broken the record yet again. \n\n\nAccording to figures from the third-party website SteamDB, over 36 million concurrent players were using Steam over the weekend. The screenshot posted to Twitter/X shows the exact figure as 36,294,835. However, the most recent data shows it as 36,354,393. That's within the last 24 hours.\n\n\n\n\nI casually mentioned last week that it can't be said for certain whether the numbers would keep going up. As of now, it does seem a pattern is emerging which suggests we might Steam log even more users. Possibly by next weekend.The PC storefront certainly has good reason to prep for upcoming demand, too. This week, we'll see Stardew Valley launch its 1.6 update first on PC tomorrow, March 19, while Dragon's Dogma 2 makes its debut on March 22. \n\n\nI should have more faith in my predictions\n\n\nThere probably isn't one single reason why these numbers have been broken for three weeks in a row. The Steam Spring Sale kicked off last week – and is ongoing until this Thursday. That could explain some of the uptick, but there's usually other factors involved.\n\n\nI guess the reasons aren't massively important. Gaming is forever becoming more popular in general, generating billions in revenue on a yearly basis. But the data on SteamDB shows the PC gaming client has seen an increase of 8.9% over the last 30 days, something that hasn't been noted in quite some time. \n\n\nThat's quite the anomaly, given there doesn't appear to have been much of note over the last weekend. Either that or I'm missing something.\n\nThe post Guess what? Steam has, once again, beaten its concurrent player record appeared first on Destructoid.",

One of these, Pale Ale, has a rather funny side effect when consumed and while it’s not difficult to make, there are some steps that need to be followed. \n\n\nIf you don’t want to make your own Pale Ale, and you’ve unlocked the Ginger Island Resort, you can purchase it there for 1,000 Gold. This is a slightly easier, less time-consuming, though more expensive option if you really just want to get tipsy (Note: being tipsy reduces movement speed). \n\n\nHow to make Pale Ale in Stardew Valley\n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nBefore you can make Pale Ale, you’ll need a Keg, which can be crafted using the following resources once you’ve reached Farming level 8:\n\n\n\n30 Wood\n\n\n1 Copper Bar\n\n\n1 Iron Bar\n\n\n1 Oak Resin\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve crafted and placed your Keg, you’re also going to need some Hops to put in it. You can purchase a Hops Starter from Pierre’s General Store for 60 Gold, and once planted you’ll need to wait 11 days before you can harvest. \n\n\nOkay, you’ve got your Keg and your Hops, now for the easy part. Put the Hops into the Keg and after one to two days, you’ll have some Pale Ale! \n\n\nWhat is Pale Ale used for?\n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nThe most important use for Pale Ale is for furthering the progress of the Community Center. Pale Ale is part of the Brewer’s Bundle in the Pantry (Revised).\n\n\nOther than this, Pale ale is a pretty commonly liked gift for the Villagers, with Pam particularly loving it. In fact, Pam requests a Pale Ale on the 14th of Summer as part of the “Pam is Thirsty” quest. Most other villagers like receiving Pale Ale as gift aside from the children (why would you give alcohol to a child?) and the following two adult Villagers:\n\n\n\nSebasitan\n\n\nPenny\n\n\n\nYou can put Pale Ale into the spool of the Sewing Machine in order to create a Black Leather Jacket, or it can be used as a yellow dye in the dye pots at Emily and Haley’s house.\n\nThe post How to get Pale Ale in Stardew Valley appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Castform variants are a tricky bunch to get due to their reliance on weather conditions. Even more so, those who don't live in snowy regions often miss out on the chance to see the creature's rarest form (with the exception of the Shiny). So, if you aren't sure how to catch Snowy Castform in Pokemon Go, here's what you can do. \n\n\nWhere to find Snowy Castform in Pokemon Go\n\n\nIf you don't live in a snowy region or are having difficulty finding Snowy Castform, the only way to get it is by completing Weather-themed Field Research tasks. The objectives primarily involve catching Pokémon with Weather Boosts, which activate with specific forecast conditions. However, the Weather Week event ends on March 18, 2024, at 8 PM local time, taking off the required tasks for the Snowy Castform. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nEven if it isn't snowing in your area, Snowy Castform appears when the event is active, regardless of weather conditions. Unfortunately, catching the creature in Pokémon Go is still very rare, so try to complete as many Field Research tasks as possible. In the case that there are no Weather-themed objectives on the board, delete a current task and spin a PokéStop to unlock them. \n\n\nOne assignment, in particular, requires the capture of multiple variants through the Weather Week Collection Challenge: Castform. This includes Normal, Sunny, Rainy, and Snowy. All types may also be captured through Field Research until the event ends. Those lucky enough to find them earn an Elite Collector medal, incense, and 5,000 Stardust. But if you miss your chance, don't worry; there will likely be another Weather Week or opportunity in the near future.  \n\nThe post How to catch Snowy Castform in Pokémon Go appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Last week, Sony produced a poll asking participants to pit PlayStation-exclusive titles against each other to see which would come out on top. The bout is still ongoing, but fans were quick to point out the absence of Bloodborne, which some may interpret as a tad suspicious.\n\n\nThe original post on Twitter/X invites users to determine \"which PlayStation game reigns supreme.\" Voting showed that—in the first round—God of War Ragnarok beat out Demon's Souls, The Last of Us: Part II trounced Horizon Forbidden West, while Returnal was pulverized by Marvel's Spider-Man.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, PlayStation fans were largely distracted by Bloodborne wasn't in the running as a pick for platform favorite. Many people—including famed YouTube personality Jacksepticeye—have been asking why FromSoftware's celebrated gothic-horror action game hasn't been included in the contest.\n\n\nA forgotten classic (forgotten by Sony, that is)\n\n\nFeel free to choose your own conspiracy theory, but it does seem odd that, in a poll asking people to crown the best PS-exclusive of all time, there's no Bloodborne, which has only ever been released on PS4. User @Bkwrd1 believes its notable absence is because Sony knows the game \"would WASH the whole list.\"\n\n\nIt's true that many have been waiting for quite some time for Bloodborne to either be remastered or remade. At the very least, fans just want it to be ported to the PS5. As such, some may interpret the game not being included in the poll as an intentional snubbing from Sony, as though it refuses to acknowledge its existence. But I'm not here to put words in your mouth.\n\n\nRecently, Bloodborne's creative director Hidetaka Miyazaki spoke about how pleased he was that so many fans are still talking about the 2015 game. Sadly, he has no knowledge about the fate of any possible remake of it.\n\nThe post Sony poll about PlayStation games prompts everyone to ask ‘where’s Bloodborne?’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's been in development for well over a decade – with an early access version of the game available to play – and has become one of the most highly-funded crowdfunding campaigns of all time. But now, the journey to a full release seems within grasp. Sort of.\n\n\nAccording to a recent letter from the chairman and founder of Cloud Imperium Games, Chris Roberts, Star Citizen is on the path to 1.0, which the team considers \"the features and content set to represent 'commercial' release.\" The letter says this means \"the game is welcoming to new players, stable, and polished with enough gameplay and content to engage players continuously.\"\n\n\n\n\nIn other words, \"it is no longer Alpha or Early Access,\" as the developer continues on a roadmap that will see the fruition of multiple milestones for the Persistent Universe (the main module of the game).\n\n\nStill a long journey ahead\n\n\nTo coincide with these plans to bring Star Citizen 1.0 to the fore, Cloud Imperium has initiated a re-organization, which includes having developers relocate to be \"closer in time zone to our main development operations in Manchester, Frankfurt, and Montreal.\"\n\n\nThere are also some words from Rich Tyrer, who recently became Senior Game Director. Tyrer has said his new role involves him \"coming on board to help push Star Citizen to the next stage of its development, ultimately culminating in leaving early access and releasing the 1.0 version of the game.\" However, there's no release date for the long-awaited commercial release.\n\n\nAs of right now, Star Citizen has amassed a total of $672,037,749 in donated funds. Given this staggering figure, you'd be forgiven for understanding why a lot of fans have grown impatient waiting well over ten years for the game proper to launch.\n\nThe post Star Citizen is heading towards its long-awaited 1.0 ‘commercial’ release appeared first on Destructoid.",

Whether I’m battling Eikons in Final Fantasy XIV or trying to chop down trees in Stardew Valley, she’s on my lap trying to play, and this My Little Pony game feels like the perfect moment to introduce her to a game she might actually be able to play. \n\n\nFrom the moment she was born, she’s seen me and my partner gaming.

The program launches today in the Steam Beta Client and it replaces the Steam Family Sharing and Steam Family View features. \nSteam Families can have up to six members, and joining gives you access to any sharable games in each member's library. “Sharable games” is an important distinction, as Family Sharing is a feature that any developer can choose to opt out of for any reason at any time. Some games are also ineligible for sharing due to technical reasons. \nNoteworthy games currently eligible for Family Sharing include Helldivers 2, Baldur's Gate 3, Balatro, Cyberpunk 2077, Elden Ring, and Hogwarts Legacy.

These debates are often full of superfluous apples-to-oranges comparisons and, as a result, are unlikely to come up with a definitive answer everyone will be happy with. But that's what makes them so fun. In that spirit, we're taking the month of March to hold our own bracket-style tournament, voted on by readers, to determine the greatest video game of all time.\nThough we here at Game Informer assembled the bracket, even that was heavily influenced by our Reader Vote we held in 2018 to coincide with our 300th issue. Using the results of our 2018 Reader Vote combined with some input from staff, general sentiment in various online communities, and critical reception for more recent games, we assembled a starting bracket of 64 games. From here, we'll hold two rounds of voting per week until we whittle this field down to one ultimate winner.\nWill this result in a definitive selection of the best game ever released? Or will it reveal a coordinated effort from a particular gaming community committed to seeing their favorite game rise through the ranks? Only time will tell. \nWhile this is meant to be a fun experiment to see how the results shake out within the Game Informer readership and community, we hope you'll come back to root for your favorites every Monday and Thursday until we are able to crown our champion in the 2024 Game Gauntlet.

It's being developed for both consoles and PC and Gameloft describes it as an \"innovative hybrid of survival, life simulation, and action RPG.\"\nDisney Dreamlight Valley is popular in the life sim genre, mixing fun gameplay, unique customization, and Disney together into a package that players seem to really enjoy. It launched into Early Access back in 2022 before the full release debuted in December. All of this is to say: if you're a fan of Disney Dreamlight Valley and Dungeons & Dragons, there's a new game to keep an eye on. \nCurrently untitled, Gameloft says in its announcement on Instagram that the game is set in the mythical Forgotten Realms, which is also the D&D setting Baldur's Gate 3 takes place in. The game, which will mix survival, life simulation, and action RPG elements into one, will feature \"unique cooperative gameplay,\" the studio says. \n\"Players can expect an adventure where the rich lore of this legendary franchise meets real-time strategy in a unique campaign of resilience, camaraderie, and danger at nearly every turn,\" the announcement reads.\" \nThere's no name for the project and no release window either. Gameloft is currently hiring for the project. \nNews of this D&D game arrives roughly a year after Wizards of the Coast, which owns the D&D IP and is a division within Hasbro, reportedly canceled five unannounced games. The last D&D game released was Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance back in 2021 – read Game Informer's review of it here. \nAre you excited about this game? Let us know in the comments below!",

You can read Game Informer's Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review here to find out why we love it so much. Now, Ubisoft is giving players another reason to jump back in with a new post-launch content roadmap. \nWhat's more, all of the new content coming to the game is set to release throughout the year, starting with new Speedrun and Permadeath modes this month as well as new outfits for Sargon. In spring, a Boss Rush will be released alongside even more outfits for Sargon, and in summer, the Divine Trials update brings new combat, platform, and puzzle challenges as well as new amulets, outfits, and more. All of this will be free, too. \nHowever, later in 2024, new paid story DLC will hit Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, although Ubisoft offers no teases about what to expect. \nIt's an exciting roadmap, doubly so considering the majority of the new content is free. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review, and then check out our breakdown of the four ways Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown gets the metroidvania genre right.

          "description": "Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Game Studios quietly snuck flying Terminid bugs into the game in the latest update, it seems. Windows Central noticed flying Shrieker bugs are enemies that appear on planets plagued with Terminids and while official accounts for the game play coy, more and more players are running into them. \nIt seems the Shriekers were added with Patch 1.000.102, which went live yesterday. Coincidentally, that patch was centered on Terminids and nerfing spawn rates for Bile Titans and Chargers on the harder difficulties of Helldivers 2. Windows Central reports Shriekers only appear when a \"Shrieker Lair\" is one of the side objectives on a planet, noting they look like \"smaller versions of the mushroom-like Spore Towers that perpetually keep a large area around them covered in a thick haze.\" \n\n\nShrieker Lairs, like the Spore Towers and Terminid egg nests can be destroyed up close and from afar with a well-placed rocket, grenade, or strategem. \nKeep your eyes on the skies, Helldivers and remember...DEMOCRACY.\nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Helldivers 2 review, and then read about a recent patch that introduced meteor showers and fire tornadoes to the game.

This update was in beta last month but rolls out for everyone starting today. \nThe biggest features are coming to the PS5's DualSense controller. The built-in speakers can now produce higher volume sound, which PlayStation says will allow players to hear in-game sounds and voice chat audio more clearly. Plus, the noise cancellation on the controller's built-in mic has been improved. \n\n\n\"The mic input quality on these controllers has been improved, courtesy of a new A.I. machine learning model,\" a PlayStation Blog post reads. \"Background noise from button presses and game audio are suppressed, resulting in a better voice chat experience.\"\nShare Screen is also getting some new features with today's update. Namely, viewers can move a pointer around and send a ping or draw a line on a shared screen, allowing them to highlight objects in-game or guide a player. Plus, viewers can now send emoji-based reactions to the host's screen – these features are turned off by default and the host and viewer must turn them on. PlayStation says these Share Screen features will hit the PS App, which also allows Share Screen, later this month. \nFinally, today's update allows users to adjust the brightness of the PS5 power indicator. Simply go to Settings, then Beep and Light, and then Brightness. \n\n\nFor more, read about the last big PS5 update that added Dolby Atmos, larger SSD capacity, and more to the console, and then check out this story about a retailer listing of a \"V2 DualSense\" with a 12-hour battery life.

          "description": "If you ask any Final Fantasy fan what their top five favorite songs in the franchise are, there's a 99 percent chance one of them is \"To Zanarkand\" from Final Fantasy X. However, it turns out, it wasn't originally intended for the game. \nThis news comes from Audrey (aitaikimochi on X, formerly Twitter), a mega Final Fantasy fan, Twitch streamer, and CEO of Aitai Japan Inc., who translated a recent interview between Weekly Ochiai and Final Fantasy X composer Nobuo Uematsu, whose credits also include One-Winged Angel and Aerith's Theme from Final Fantasy VII and so much more. In that interview, Uematsu revealed \"To Zanarkand\" originally began as a piece for a French flute player, meant to be played during a recital. \n\n\n\"'To Zanarkand' was actually not meant to be the theme for Final Fantasy X,\" Uematsu tells Weekly Ochiai, as translated by Audrey on X. \"There was a flute player from France who originally asked me to write a song for them to play during a recital. When I wrote the piece, I thought perhaps this sounded a bit too sad for a recital. So I set it aside for the time being. \n\"Sometime after, when I was making the score of Final Fantasy X, I was falling behind all the while the producers were hounding me. So since that flute piece was unused, I just kind of meekly handed it to them. They listened to it and said, 'Yes! This is brilliant!'\" \nIn retrospect, it's wild \"To Zanarkand\" wasn't originally composed by Uematsu for Final Fantasy X because it fits the game's themes so well, nailing the somber and sad tone present throughout Tidus and Yuna's journey in Spira. \nFor more about Final Fantasy music, read Game Informer's exclusive four-part series on composer Masayoshi Soken's score for last year's Final Fantasy XVI:\nPart 1: Creating The Prelude\nPart 2: The Victory Fanfare\nPart 3: Finding A Main Theme\nPart 4: The Sound\nAfter that, read Game Informer's review of Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster. \nWhat's your favorite Final Fantasy theme song?

After launching Payday 3, the company is well-positioned to leverage the strengths of the organization to monetize and develop the IP portfolio. I am looking forward to assuming an operative position and, together with the management, ensure the execution of this strategy.\"\nGoeldner has 40 years of experience in the games industry, including several executive positions, according to the notice. His last executive position was as CEO of Focus Home Interactive. He has been a member of Starbreeze's board of directors since last year. Starbreeze has initiated a recruitment process for a permanent CEO. \n\n\nPayday 3 hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on September 21.

          "description": "MultiVersus, the Warner Bros. free-to-play crossover platform fighter, makes its big comeback on May 28. The game has been rebuilt and returns almost a year after its open beta was taken offline.\nPlayer First Games game director Tony Huynh explains in a developer diary that MultiVersus has been remade from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5, meaning it sports improved visuals and lighting. It also has a totally revamped netcode to provide what Huynh promises will be consistent online performance regardless of platform.\nEvery existing fighter sports new attacks and combat mechanics, and Huynh promises that new fighters are on the way. Additionally, new stages were teased with concept art depicting arenas based on The Powerpuff Girls’ Townsville and Dexter’s Laboratory.\nLastly, Huynh reveals a brand-new PvE mode is coming to the game. He doesn’t go into detail, only teasing it will offer “additional ways of playing with unique rewards.” \n\n\nMultiVersus was first launched in open beta last May and pits characters across Warner Bros. stable of IPs, such as DC, Looney Tunes, and even Game of Thrones, in a tag-team-focused twist of Super Smash Bros. inspired combat. The game was initially quite popular and generally well-liked. Writer Bryan Vore gave the game’s beta incarnation an 8 out of 10 in our review, writing that “Living games have the potential to go in frustrating directions, but MultiVersus has a strong foundation. If it can meaningfully roll out content and smooth out its rough edges, this could become a new crossover obsession for years to come.” \nUnfortunately, months of infrequent updates and lack of communication following the game’s second season saw engagement decline. Player First Games pulled MultiVersus from stores to address these criticisms. When the game returns, it will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.\nAre you looking forward to jumping back into the new and improved MultiVersus?

Movie, Nintendo and Illumination have announced that work has begun on a second movie set in the world of Super Mario Bros. The announcement, made by Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto and Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri, states that this film will arrive in theaters in the United States on April 3, 2026.\nWhile the announcement stops short of calling this \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" or even referring to it as a sequel, Miyamoto confirms that Nintendo and Illumination are working together on this one, and the director duo of the first film, Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, are returning. \"As for the details of the new movie, as I often say, we'll let you know once we're at the stage where we're ready to share more,\" Miyamoto said in the announcement video posted on Nintendo of America's YouTube channel. \"This time, we're thinking about broadening Mario's world further and it'll have a bright and fun story. We hope you'll look forward to it!\"\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie stars Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Day, Jack Black, Keegan-Michael Key, and Seth Rogen. Nintendo and Illumination have yet to confirm any of the cast of this new film set in the Super Mario Bros. world. The Super Mario Bros. Movie arrived in theaters on April 5, 2023 to positive fan and critic reception, and earned a place among the highest-grossing films of all time. The new film set in this same world is set to arrive almost exactly three years later on April 3, 2026.\nWhat do you want to see from a new Super Mario Bros. animated movie? Do you think it'll be another wide cast film? Or will it zero in on a specific subset of characters, like a Luigi's Mansion or Donkey Kong Country movie?",

However, a few months after the game's June release during The Game Awards 2023, Square Enix revealed FFXVI would be getting two DLCs. \nThe first – Echoes of the Fallen – was a combat-centric DLC released that same night. The second – The Rising Tide – is a more expansive, story-focused DLC about the Leviathan Eikon curiously missing from the main game. While we still don't know when to expect The Rising Tide other than this spring, I spoke to Yoshida and DLC director Takeo Kujiraoka about what players can expect and more, and you can read about that in my preview here. \n\n\nI also asked the d…",

          "description": "Famed manga artist and Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama has passed away. He was 68.\nThe news was broken early this morning in a public letter by Toriyama's manga studio, Bird Studio. Bird revealed in a letter posted on the official Dragon Ball X account that Toriyama died on March 1 of acute subdural hematoma. A private funeral service was held, and the studio has asked fans to respect the privacy of Toriyama's family. You can read the full letter below.\nInformation ; Dear Friends and Partnershttps://t.co/85dXseckzJ pic.twitter.com/aHlx8CGA2M\nMarch 8, 2024\nAkira Toriyama was born in 1955 and became a manga artist at 23. Primarily known for his works in Weekly Shōnen Jump for works such as Dr. Slump, his biggest claim to fame would be Dragon Ball. First published in 1983, Dragon Ball would explode into a cultural phenomenon, spawning a massively popular multimedia franchise with multiple manga volumes, a successful long-running anime, several films, and a litany of merchandise. Dragon Ball has become one of the most influential mangas of all time and would also become a massive fixture in video games, with dozens of titles across a variety of platforms. \nUpcoming games based on Toryiama’s work include Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero, the next entry in the Budakai Tenkaichi series, and Sand Land, an action RPG launching on April 26 based on his 2000 manga. \nToryiama would also lend his distinct art style to video games such as the Dragon Quest series, Chrono Trigger, and Blue Dragon. Six years ago, Game Informer editors current and former got together to talk about Toriyama's influence on the game industry. You can watch that video here.\nGame Informer extends its condolences to Toriyama’s family and loved ones.",

Targeted repositories included pirate apps and games, as well as hundreds of RARBG backups. The number of takedowns has increased significantly in recent years. However, legitimate projects have grown faster and GitHub says it continues to take a developer-first approach.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

          "description": "For the 17th time, ScummVM has again been accepted for the Google Summer of Code program this summer.\nThe program intends to bring new contributors into open source projects. In the most recent two years this has included both students and non-students as eligible candidates for participation.\nLike last year, participants can apply for working on either short tasks (about 175 hours of work), or large tasks (about 350 hours of work). The coding period typically runs from start of June through August, but there is some flexibility which allows participants to have longer time frames if they are unable to work full time through the summer.\nScummVM is looking for people interested in participating in GSoC with us. A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we are also open to your own ideas as well. Please provide the required information in your application before submitting.\nWe also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server, in the #scummvm-gsoc channel. This allows you to engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, to get advice about how to get involved with the project, as well as writing your application.\nBased on our previous 16 years of experience with GSoC, we have put together a Google Summer of Code miniportal to help you get started.\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\n>",

          "description": "If you don’t know me, I’m Owen Rudge, and have been involved in the online Transport Tycoon community for almost 25 years. Exactly 21 years ago, I received an ICQ message (look it up, kids) out of the blue from a guy named Ludvig Strigeus (nicknamed Ludde). “Hello, you probably don’t know me, but I’ve been working on a project to clone TTD for a while.” he said, more or less. He didn’t want to release this to the public yet, and wasn’t entirely sure what he was going to do with it. (He’d been working on it since 30th June 2002, so I guess that is technically the birthday of what would become OpenTTD…) Ludde sent me a copy of what he’d been working on, and it was very exciting indeed. It was a fully functional version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, written in C. Admittedly incomplete at that time, it was still quite remarkable.",
