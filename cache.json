Starting life as a Shin Megami Tensei spin-off in 1996 with Revelations: Persona on PS1, Persona took a while to reach a wider audience. A shift in tone, some more slice-of-life and school elements, and a gradual upgrade and explosion in style and aesthetics put Atlus' turn-based RPG series on the map. It's far eclipsed SMT in popularity nowadays, with Persona 5 being one of the most recognisable games in the genre.\nWhile Shin Megami Tensei has a storied history with the Big N, Persona took much longer to make the jump to Nintendo systems. A few years of spin-offs on the 3DS and Switch paved the way for Persona 5 Royal and, eventually, the other \"modern\" Persona games to come to Switch.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Best not speculate.\nAnyway, Fallout London is a huge effort from modders Team Folon that was recently sabotaged when Bethesda treated Fallout 4 to a next gen update to capitalise on the Amazon TV show's popularity, rendering several mods incompatible and breaking a lot of stuff. Team Folon have now fiddled with the workings and sent a Fallout London build to GOG for QA testing, which suggests that release is imminent. The catch, however, is that you will need to downgrade your copy of Fallout 4 to play the mod, because even with Team Folon's last-minute adjustments, Fallout 4 next gen and Fallout London simply don't get on.\n Read more",

Like the lootbox hawkers of yesteryear, gacha designers understand the appeal and power of a pleasingly animated gizmo, ker-chunking open and fizzing with potential. This poppy visual and sonic language stretches across Hoyo's latest game, from its cinematic moments, to each character's attacks, to the cute bunny mascots that erupt into gatling guns, to the barista's coffee-making ritual and the recipes of the robo-limbed noodle server.

The best-known is probably Frostpunk, with its perpetual raging against the dying of the light, its ceaseless scrape for coal and wood as the temperature falls. Anoxia Station, announced this month, is similarly driven by the gathering of fossil fuels, and similarly shaped by questions of worker death and morale, but it takes you deep underground - into a sumptuous, brutal world of quartz crystals, salt caves, magma lakes, moonmilk rivers, swirling gases and, judging from the below trailer, enormous maggots and centipedes.

The tune you were whistling dies in your throat as you hurry past into the reassuring shadow of the relatively gnomeless bungalows to either side.

          "description": "Capcom spat a little squirt of news bile on us yesterday, like a hideous zombie vomiting up demos and release dates. One of the smaller chunks was a brief comment by Resident Evil 7 director Koshi Nakanishi, who confirmed that a new Resident Evil game is in the works. That's not too much of a surprise - big franchise gonna franchise - but still, it's nice to hear.  \"It was really difficult to figure out what to do after [Resident Evil] 7,\" he said, \"but I found it. And to be honest it feels substantial.\"\nRead more",

          "description": "The Fear & Hunger games are pitch-black horror RPGs quite unlike anything else I’ve ever played, taking aspects of JRPG, survival horror and adventure games and distilling them into something I’d be tempted to call bleakly nihilistic if they didn’t display so much evident love for their craft. They also both start with a content warning listing “extreme violence, gore, sexual violence, and drug usage”. You’ll want to take this seriously, and just to be clear: the third item on this list does manifest in some tasteless, albeit brief, ways in the first game. It’s a frustrating blemish on what is otherwise an incredibly evocative and creative series, though you can download a mod to censor the more egregious bits. You will miss the full effect of critically severing an ogre’s massive schlong, however.\n \nRead more",

The little spinning symbol cautioning players against impatient acts of powering down. \"Don't turn off your system when this symbol is displayed,\" goes the message seen often while booting up a game (or some other version of these words). The implication is clear. The saving process is delicate and if you interrupt this invisible ritual the data that's being written to some folder deep in your PC's innards will become corrupted, wrecked, banjaxed. You will lose all your progress, all your precious swords and accomplishments.\nBut is this true? How likely are you to really suffer a catastrophic loss of shotgun shells? To find out, I decided to spend a very annoying afternoon of turning my gaming rig off and on again during multiple games. Was this a good idea? I don't know.

There's a lot more substance to back up the style than I thought there would be, alongside it feeling a lot more compact than the behemoth I envisioned in my head.

          "description": "Mika and The Witch's Mountain appears to be an unofficial video game adaptation of Kiki's Delivery Service, which is a Studio Ghibli film about a witch who decides to go postal, but not in the Running with Scissors sense. Created by developers Chibig and Nukefist, it's a \"mini open world\" game about carrying packages by broomstick while investigating the titular mountain, flying through hoops a la Pilotwings, and savouring the balmy inconsequentiality of an island that reminds me of Super Mario Sunshine. It also now has an early access release date, 21st August, and a charming new trailer.\n Read more",

If memory serves, when they ran that particular trailer I was busy sponging swampwater out my eyes after writing up South Of Midnight, while Nic had become so vociferously agitated over the debut of Doom: Dark Ages that he was no longer solid and tangible enough to operate a keyboard. Graham had long since absconded with Joanna Dark to Immersive Sim Land and Matt, poor Matt, had fallen into a Locust sinkhole while \"omnimanouevring\" around Black Ops 6. But if one of us had been free and willing we might have had enthusiastic thoughts about this \"evolution of JRPGs\", in which you must thwart a self-serious artist who is about to magically murder everybody over the age of 32. It is, alas, too late for me.\n Read more",

Two hours being the length of the free Dragon's Dogma 2 trial that is now live on Steam. For context, this is approximately how much time Capcom gave me to preview their latest action-RPG, many headline cycles ago. During that brief window, I managed to become the worst wizard in Dragon's Dogma 2, but I know you can go further.

In the latest episode, they're discussing their (relatively new) Boston studio and how it's spearheading the as-yet-enigmatic sequel to Cyberpunk 2077. There's a lot of middle-managey chit chat but one thing that stood out was one developer's earnest remarks about what he considers some of the sci-fi RPG's shortcomings. \n\"I see that we didn't push the envelope far enough in some places, for instance,\" said Paweł Sasko, Associate Game Director at CD Project RED.  \"Like, let's say the homeless crisis... when I look at it, I'm like, we weren't far enough in '77.

Amid all these unique collaborations, we will now have a WWE crossover for Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone, set for Season 5 on July 24, 2024.\n\n\nEven if I've grown accustomed to the bizarreness of these collaborations, the franchise never ceases to surprise me. Though, a WWE crossover isn't too out of left field, given that they both involve fighting in some shape or form. \n\n\nThe teaser for the World Wrestling Entertainment x Call of Duty event only showed us a brief clip of a wrestling ring. It didn't take fans too long in the comments to come up with Operator desires, including the legendary Randy Savage, also known as Macho Man.\n\n\n\n\nI'm hoping for a John Cena Operator skin, given that he's about to do his last match in WWE. However, I'm not sure how it would work since you won't be able to see him.\n\n\nWhoever shows up in the CoD ring will undoubtedly offer a dynamic Finishing Move, bringing the smackdown to MW3 and Warzone. The characters will likely feature a few iconic voice lines they're known for, as we've seen with past Operator iterations.\n\n\nImage via Activision\n\n\nBased on the wrestling ring teaser in the trailer, Call of Duty Season 5 may implement this setting in an event or new mode. Game modes have been picking up recently, especially with the entertaining Get Higher event. A WWE rendition could continue on this fun track, potentially showcasing a 1v1 or 2v2 match.\n\n\nGet ready to mark your calendars for the WWE x Call of Duty crossover on July 24.

          "description": "If you’re a lover of minions in Final Fantasy XIV, the good news is that Dawntrail is full of them. One of them, the Mischief Maker, is what we can call cute in his own way, especially if you like clowns or clown-adjacent things. \n\n\nThe good news is that in order to get the Mischief Maker, you’ll get to enjoy what is possibly one of the best dungeons added to FFXIV in a long time. \n\n\nHow to get the Mischief Maker minion in Final Fantasy XIV\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe Mischief Maker minion comes from perhaps the most appropriate dungeon, The Strayborough Deadwalk. This dungeon can be unlocked once you complete the Dawntrail MSQ and reach level 100, and is also one of the Duty Roulette: Expert dungeons. \n\n\nTo get your hands on the Mischief Maker, you’ll need to get through all three boss battles of The Strayborough Deadwalk - His Royal Headness Leonogg I, Jack-in-the-pot, and Träumerei. \n\n\nOnce you’ve defeated Träumerei, there is a chance that the Mischief Maker minion will appear in the final coffer of the dungeon, although this is not guaranteed. \n\n\nCan you buy the Mischief Maker minion in Final Fantasy XIV\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nAs a tradeable minion, Mischief Maker can be purchased on the Marketboard, although it’s not the cheapest to buy. \n\n\nAt the time of writing, the Mischief Maker minion can be bought on my home world for around 900,000 Gil. This price obviously varies by server, but according to Universalis, the lowest price for this minion on North American servers is around 500,000 Gil. \n\nThe post How to get the Mischief Maker minion in FFXIV Dawntrail appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "In a recent blogpost from Blizzard, we got new details on one of the biggest features coming to World of Warcraft in The War Within: Warbands. These aren't just a boon for players who have a baseball team's worth of alt-characters, they're a bit of a technical marvel as well. \n\n\nWarbands are, in the simplest terms, a gaggle of four characters across any faction, realm, even account, limited only by region (e.g. Americas, Europe). These four characters can share a whole slew of features, ranging from a collective bank, parallel progression for faction reputation, the ability to trade currencies, and more. Gear will even feature a new binding modifier, \"Warbound until equipped,\" so that you can toss gear for your alts into their shared bank. \n\n\nThe most impressive bit of black magic is the sharing of things like reputation, mounts, transmog, achievements and currency across accounts. Blizzard is assuming, of course, that these accounts all belong to one player, but the ability to quickly access characters across different subscriptions probably took no shortage of backend labor. \n\n\nHere's a quick list of what's shared within a Warband:\n\n\n\nGold and most currencies, though some older currencies may incur a character transfer fee\n\n\nA collective bank of Warband items, non-soulbound items, and reagents \n\n\nMount, toy, and pet collections\n\n\nMost reputation progress\n\n\nMost achievements and their rewards\n\n\nMap exploration progress\n\n\nFlight points\n\n\n\nWhile there are several exceptions to what is shared, like certain achievements and reputations, the trend toward an utterly alt-friendly World of Warcraft that kicked off in Dragonflight seems to be continuing. Warbands are arriving with the pre-expansion patch, which goes live on July 23.\n\nThe post WoW’s upcoming Warbands are an alt-lover’s dream come true appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It’s that time of the year when reports about EA Sports FC 25 start to pop up, as the game’s official announcement draws inevitably near. The EA FC 25 release date has been leaked by popular insider billbil-kun (via Dealabs), who claims that FC 25 will be released on September 27, 2024. The report estimates that EA will announce the next game by July 17, but the exact date is unknown at the moment.\n\n\nMoreover, the FC 25 logo has also been apparently leaked by X/Twitter account PlaystationSize, giving fans the first look at what looks to be almost the same logo as FC 24 but with green as the primary color. PlaystationSize has also claimed that FC 25 will be released for PlayStation 4.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it would be surprising that EA is still pushing for FC 25 to be available on previous-gen. While it is understandable that a major portion of gamers are still on these consoles, the online cross-play functionality becomes restricted. Currently, FC 24 players on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC can play with and against each other, but cannot get into a match with players on the old-gen.\n\n\nEA’s football simulation titles generally get revealed in July or August, with a release date set for sometime in September of the same year. So, this report might hold true about a September release date, but it remains to be seen if the game will actually launch on September 27.\n\n\nThe report on Dealabs also claims that FC 25 Standard Edition would cost $69.99 on PC, whereas the Ultimate Edition is said to be priced at $99.99. Gamers who buy the Ultimate Edition will reportedly get to play the game seven days before the global launch, just like how things were for FC 24 when it was launched.\n\nThe post EA Sports FC 25 leak claims it will arrive in September appeared first on Destructoid.",

They have received four games – three for Game Boy Advance, one for DS – but only the 2009 DS game ever released in America. Today, the original three Game Boy Advance games are now available for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. The games retain their original title, Densetsu no Stafy, and have not been localized.

It was only last year that we played Double Dragon Gaiden, a pixelated throwback brawler (or belt-scroll action game, per its official YouTube description) take on the franchise.\nThis next entry is decidedly more modern, with fully 3D visuals. It's not the first time the series has explored this dimension, but it is a rare occurrence. The game is being developed by Yuke's, the developer that worked on the WWE 2K franchise until 2K19 and most recently developed AEW: Fight Forever. It is being published, or presented by, as the trailer implies, Arc System Works, the developer behind Guilty Gear and Dragon Ball FighterZ.\nDouble Dragon Revive is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and One, and PC sometime in 2025.\n\n\nFor a whole lot more on Double Dragon, but maybe not the version of Double Dragon you're thinking, head here to read all about the 1994 movie. Back in 2019, I tracked down the film's director, James Yukich, to talk about the bizarre film's trajectory, what went wrong, and what he would have done differently had he been giving a chance to try making the film again.",

And later this year, there will be a handful of price increases for various tiers.

These changes will enable us to bring members more value and more great games to Game Pass.\nThe new Xbox Game Pass Standard tier for new members will be $15 a month and will not include access to Day One releases, EA Play, Game Pass for PC, and cloud gaming.\nXbox Game Pass Ultimate, which includes access to all the bonuses now not included in the Standard tier is increasing its price from $17 a month to $20.\nXbox Game Pass Core, which offers online access and a much smaller library of curated games, is changing its yearly from $60 to $75. The $10 monthly price for that tier, however, will remain unchanged.\nPC Game Pass is increasing from $10 per month to $12, but that tier will still include Day One releases.\nAll of these price changes will be reflected starting on September 12.\nPrice changes for services you already pay for are always frustrating.

This action grants an opportunity to follow up with an attack on the spot while simultaneously adding to RE4’s original close-quarter smackdown.\nAdapting this to the PlayStation VR2 wasn’t easy.

Owners of these games will still be able to play their single-player content, but online support for these titles will end on November 7. The embedded announcement post on X also includes a link to an FAQ to answer additional questions about the sunsetting process. \nhttps://t.co/2W8dLlGjBM\nJune 28, 2024\nWhile the digital PS3/Xbox 360 versions of these games are going away, Battlefield 3 will still be available to purchase on PC. The same is true for Battlefield 4 and Hardline, and these two titles will also remain on sale for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The PC/PS4/Xbox One versions will remain unaffected by today’s updates.\nIt never feels good to see games get removed from sale like this. The reason likely has to do with EA sunsetting online support; it wouldn't be right to continue selling games with popular online modes if that component doesn't work anymore. For those still logging into Battlefield matches on PS3 and 360, you've got a few more months to enjoy the ride.\nFor more on Battlefield, you can learn about how the next entry is shaping up (which is being made with help by Dead Space remake developer Motive Studios) here.",

          "description": "With just four days in Seoul, South Korea, I filled my maps app with pins of restaurants, Buddhist temples, must-see attractions, scenic parks, market streets, and more to visit. I clocked around 10 miles of walking daily and think I saw as much of this massive city as possible with my allotted time. My journey from east to west, north to south of Seoul was only possible by the city’s expansive public transportation network of buses and trains. And while I listened to “Magnetic” by K-Pop group ILLIT more times than I’ll admit (when in Korea, right?) through headphones on these trains and buses, I spent much of my time observing how others spent time waiting for their stop.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, everyone is glued to their phones, myself included.

          "description": "Throughout my visit to BioWare's Edmonton office for Game Informer's current cover story about Dragon Age: The Veilguard, game director Corinne Busche reiterates that the studio designed the game with inclusivity in mind. That's extremely evident in the character creator, where players begin their journey in Veilguard. It's easily the best character creator in series history and possibly the most robust I've ever seen in a video game. From hundreds of sliders and options to customize your player-controlled Rook to the ability to pick pronouns separate from gender and more, this character creator speaks directly to the inclusivity of Veilguard – read about my in-depth look at the character creator here. \nBut that feeling doesn't end in the character creator.

Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days.

Instead of competing with Life Is Strange, a series that Don't Nod created with the first Life Is Strange and continued with Life Is Strange 2 before Double Exposure developer Deck Nine took over with 2017's Before the Storm and 2021's True Colors, the studio decided to push to 2025. \nWe've made the decision to move the release dates of Lost Records: Bloom & Rage to early 2025. We know you're all excited for both Lost Records and the new Life is Strange game, and we wanted to ensure both have adequate space to shine. The wait will be worth it! pic.twitter.com/PH1O7z3uUy\nJune 28, 2024\nLife Is Strange: Double Exposure launches October 29, and now, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, which will be released in two parts, will launch sometime early next year. Both games are set to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. \nIn the meantime, watch the reveal trailer for Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, and then watch the Life Is Strange: Double Exposure reveal trailer.

Despite my expectations, I was not prepared for how robust it actually is in Veilguard. Robust enough, even, that BioWare used it to create most of the NPCs in the game, save for mainline characters like companions. Setting hyperbole aside, it is a staggeringly rich creation system, and I look forward to seeing player-created near-replicas of celebrities and monstrous creations that'd be more at home in a horror game. \nBut I'm also looking forward to the community's reaction to the Dragon Age series' best character creator yet.

Originally slated to launch next month on July 25, the upcoming narrative-driven city-builder is now arriving on September 20.\nDeveloper 11 Bit Studios sates that following a recent beta, the team wants to take extra time addressing feedback to ensure the best possible experience. In a press release, design director Jakub Stokalski and art director Lukasz Juszczyk issued the following statement:\n“Based on the surveys we received after playing Beta, the average rating you gave us was 8 out of 10. We’re super grateful for that! At the same time, it was only a small slice of a work-in-progress, still-growing game. While our backlog is plentiful, it was an opportunity for us to listen to what you enjoyed, and what didn’t quite land yet”. \n“This allowed us to prioritise things better, and bring upfront the features and modifications we were already working on. But we also realised that to guarantee the best possible experience on launch, we need more time to finish the development of Frostpunk 2. That’s why we made the difficult decision to postpone its release to September 20th, 2024”.\n11 Bit States that it plans to work on new additions to existing game mechanics and improve the UI and UX, among other things. \nFrostpunk 2 will launch first for PC on September 20. PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions are planned to arrive later. We recently played the game, and you can read our extensive preview here.",

More specifically, it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam) on August 1, and it brings with it updated visuals and controls and a new skin that harkens back to the original game's most infamous easter egg. \nIn the reveal trailer, we get a look at the graphical improvements Aspyr has implemented in Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, but the game still retains that 2002 PlayStation 2 and GameCube charm. This re-release follows a limited PlayStation 4 physical run that launched back in 2019. \nCheck out the Star Wars: Bounty Hunter announcement trailer below: \n\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, you play as Jango Fett throughout the story, which itself is a prequel to Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. \nIn the original game, there was an easter egg message that said, \"Cash in all bounties to play as Boba.\" However, cashing in all bounties did not let you play as Boba. To make good on that original promise from 2002, Aspyr media has included a Boba Fett skin in Star Wars: Bounty Hunters you can use after completing the game's campaign. \nStar Wars: Bounty Hunter hits PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on August 1. \nWhile waiting for its launch, check out this lengthy gameplay demo of Star Wars Outlaws, another mercenary-centric Star Wars game launching this year.

Though the once previously Xbox-exclusive game has since made its way to PlayStation and PC platforms, it remains unclear which platforms this remaster is coming to. And there's no word on when to expect the remaster either. \nRevealed with a short 47-second teaser trailer, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster looks great, almost more like a remake than a remaster. It's unclear if this is a remaster of the original 2006 game or the HD version of Dead Rising that launched on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC back in 2017. Regardless, we're stoked to head back into a zombie-infested mall with journalist Frank West whenever this remaster launches. \nCheck out the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster teaser trailer for yourself below: \n\n\n\nAre you excited for Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster?

If its first trailer,  which was revealed by IGN today, is any indication, farming/townbuilding sim fans will want to keep an eye on the game. \nThe reveal trailer gives us a great look at what to expect, which includes ranching, treasure hunting, mining, farming, and, of course, romancing. The game is coming to PC sometime in the future, but there's no release date or window in sight. Cattle Country's Steam listing simply says the release date is \"to be announced.\" \nCheck out the Cattle Country reveal trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you might be able to hear, the Cattle Country reveal trailer is narrated by Red Dead Redemption 2's Arthur Morgan, or rather, Arthur Morgan's voice actor, Roger Clark. \n\"Cattle Country straddles the saddle of cozy wholesome gaming and action-adventure,\" the game's Steam listing reads. \"Serving up hours of the slice-of-life you'd expect on the frontier – including mining, fishing, crafting, and farming – along with deep-rooted Wild West quests delivering stories of romance, cattle drives, bandits, and robberies.\"\nHere are some Cattle Country screenshots: \n\nWhile waiting to learn more about Cattle Country, read Game Informer's Stardew Valley review, and then read about Stardew Valley developer ConcernedApe's next simulation game, Haunted Chocolatier. \nWhat do you think of Cattle Country's reveal?

          "description": "The one and only Elden Ring expansion we're getting, Shadow of the Erdtree, launched last week and thousands of Tarnished went to the shadow realm to take on dozens of new enemies, bosses, and more. Now, just a few days later, developer From Software has released a new patch for the game that should make Shadow of the Erdtree a bit easier. \nNow live, Calibration Update 1.12.2 targets the scaling of the attack and damage negation given to players with each Shadow Realm Blessing upgrade. Here's what's changed: \nThe attack and damage negation has been increased for the first half of the maximum amount of Blessing enhancements, and the second half will now be more gradual. \nThe attack and damage negation granted by the final level of Blessing enhancements has been slightly increased. \n\n\nThis patch should apply automatically like any other Elden Ring update but if it doesn't – the Calibration Version listed at the bottom right reads \"1.12.2\" if it has – select \"LOGIN\" and that will apply the latest version of the game. \nThe only other thing this update contains is word from From Software on a confirmed bug where the raytracing settings of Shadow of the Erdtree are automatically enabled (if you've previously loaded save data from previous game versions), which is causing framerate issues for some players. If you're encountering said issues, check to see if you have raytracing on or off in the game's system graphical settings. \nThis patch arrives after one that hit the game last week, which added new hairtsyles, inventory features, balance adjustments, and more to Elden Ring ahead of Shadow of the Erdtree's launch. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review, and then check out this interview where From Software's Hidetaka Miyazaki discusses his approach to difficulty in games. \nWhat do you think of this update?

Its unique aim, timing of your power, and launch aspect makes this one of the most “easy-to-learn, hard-to-master” type games.

No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.\nThis is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.\nIf you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.\nNow, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)\n>",
