If you speak to one of them, it will state that Peach brought them back with her from the Moon as a souvenir.

          "description": "These hands are rated E for Everyone.\nA couple years ago, a small Croatian development team called Room-C set out to create a new game set in Arthurian mythology called The Hand of Merlin. Following a roguelite structure and based around high-difficulty, tactical gameplay, the release quickly gained a passionate fanbase that eagerly awaited each new iteration as the title went through Early Access on Steam. Now that the title has finally reached 1.0 status, it’s been ported to consoles, and we’re happy to report that the final product is an enjoyable and intense experience that’s well worth your time.\nThe narrative in The Hand of Merlin is kept to a minimum, consisting of a larger overarching event that’s filled in by various smaller emergent events which change from run to run. The main thrust of the story here is that there’s a terrible Cataclysm slowly corrupting the land and killing off life, and the spirit of Merlin the Wizard is the last hero of the Round Table who can do something about it. Though he’s, uh, sorta dead, he’s able to travel the multiverse and help various bands of heroes and adventurers in their quest to save their world. If they fail and die, Merlin bails on them and goes to another universe to try again.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The RTS potential for an interplanetary ground war against overwhelming swarms of giant not-insects is obvious enough. But the dual spirit of most Paul Verhoeven films is a major reason that The Extraordinary Lust Of Dizzy (working title: Starship Troopers) still holds up 25 years on.\n\r\n\r\nTerran Command understands that. Certainly it nods to the satire here and there, but mostly it focuses on the shooting and desperate defences and evacuations instead. This was the right decision. Though it's a little short on narrative flavour, unless you're really into exploring the setting, it's got enough tactical heft to make up for it.\r\n\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The RTX 2060 isn't the new hotness that it was a few years ago, but a global pandemic and chip shortage means that the card is still a surprisingly capable option three years later. The cheapest RTX 2060 on Amazon costs £370, but if you're willing to go refurbished you pay way less: just £190. \nThat's a heck of a deal for an RTX and DLSS-capable graphics card, especially given the GPUs come with a six month warranty from the folks at Laptop Outlet. This Zotac card will run rings around the GTX 1660 Super, the best card you could buy new for this price, especially in games that support DLSS to boost frame-rates. \nRead more",

In fact in the presentation the game was referred to as a \"farmadventure\", which isn't a portmanteau and you only have to go another centimetere along to get farmventure, which is just about a portmanteau and, furthermore, is fun to say. \nDevelopers Frame Break are keen to emphasise how chilled out Lightyear Frontier is: it's very peaceful, and there's no death (a \"survival game without survival\"). It's all about ecology and being one with nature. This does, at times, feel slightly at odds with the other eye-catching thing about Lightyear Frontier, which is a bloody massive tractor mech stomping about everywhere. \nRead more",

He’s one of the more memorable characters you meet in Tendershoot’s alternate reality web simulator, an angsty teenage boy whose home page is slathered in camouflage textures and GIFS of exploding handguns. Since release, Zane has become one of Hypnospace’s de facto mascots, a beloved dweeb that is abrasive but also kind of painfully relatable? It’s hard to laugh at Zane’s baggy trousers and love for Linkin Park-esque rap-metal when you grew up in the mid-2000’s. I mean, we all bought a dog lead from Wilkinson’s and hooked it between the belt loops on our jeans at one point, right? …right?\n\n\nAhem. Anyway. Announced earlier this year alongside Dreamsettler (a proper sequel to Hypnospace), Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer is an FPS spin-off that stars the fan-favourite teen. Slayers X is framed as being an in-universe project that Zane worked on as a teen, and has been uncovered by his now 37-year-old self, who is determined to finally see it released. There’s a short demo available as part of Steam’s most recent Next Fest, and I’m delighted to say it’s exactly what I hoped it would be.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Abib the troubadour killed an ancient evil spirit by throwing his knife at it. Tinyfolks is not a \"story generator\" sort of game, but that fight removed any doubt that it was excellent.\r\n\n\r\nThere's no shortage of dungeon-ish turn based combat games, nor of those made of all the usual fantasy archetypes, nor of pixelly low-fi games with bleepy bloopy music. Nor again are we likely to run short of games that combine some or all of the above. But like a good meal, combining even the most common ingredients in just the right way can make them delicious.\r\n\n\r\nIt doesn't matter that you're a monarch ousted by evil forces, now set on reclaiming your land within 45 days by fighting tonnes of monsters until your team is tough enough to kill the big nasty. What matters is that you'll have a great time doing it.\r\n\n \nRead more",

So everyone was pretty excited to see what this new space RPG holds at the Xbox & Bethesda Showcase stream this weekend. And, sure enough, we actually got a pretty big eyeful of it.\nNow, keep in mind that this game is set in outer space, the vast expanse and wonders of which we cannot ken. You could do any cool, awe-inspiring thing you want with space. Crystal waterfalls that flow backwards into the sky. Aurora borealis-like lights but so low down they whip along at ground level. Deserts of hot-pink dust sprouting deep blue rock spires. Destiny 2 has some cool planets, for example. Imagine my confusion, then, when the footage of Bethesda's brand new IP made it look like they've accidentally done Fallout or Elder Scrolls again.\nRead more",

Arkane's spooky co-op FPS has been on my most anticipated list for a while, especially because I was hoping the studio would put their signature weird twist on things. Judging by the big guns and big abilities you have at your disposal, they have - and the vampires should be watching their be-caped backs. Never thought I'd see the day when someone made being a vampire hunter look cooler than being a vamp, but we might be getting there. \nRead more",

One of the coolest announcements at the event was Hill Agency: PURITYdecay, described as an \"Indigenous cybernoir detective game\" and in the works at Achimostawinan Games. Although maybe \"in the works\" isn't quite an accurate description, because the game is in fact out very soon: on August 31st this year, to be exact.\nThe trailer is a pitch-perfect hearkening back to the golden age hardboiled detective stories of the 1940s — complete with a black-and-white palette with just the occasional hint of colour to highlight the high-tech parts. High-tech because, despite its 20th century influences, this game is set quite far in the future, in 2262. It's not exactly a nice vision of the world in 240 years' time, though, as the narrator is quick to point out that it's riddled with \"crime, conflict, and propaganda\".

It's about time to check out the Final Fantasy VII 25th Anniversary Celebration, which will be streaming live at 3:00 p.m. Pacific today. What's on the docket? Officially, Square Enix has promised \"all the latest information relating to the 25th anniversary of Final Fantasy VII.\"\nDepending on who you ask (and which leaks you believe), this stream could touch on many different things — a Steam release of Final Fantasy VII Remake, a coveted glimpse of FFVII Remake Part 2, and potentially even some FFVII \"expanded universe\" news.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wohQiEysqIA\nYou can watch the event live on YouTube and Twitch.\nWhile the FFVII 25th Anniversary Celebration stream is supposed to be on the shorter side, the hype for this event has really snowballed in the past 24 hours, as is the way.\nAdmittedly, I'm less interested in hearing about stuff like The First Soldier and Ever Crisis, and with Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2 such an unknown quantity at this point, I'm sure many of you feel the same way. If we get anything concrete on the Naoki Hamaguchi-directed game, and maybe a fun wild-card announcement, I'll be happy. A few details — heck, even a bit of familiar imagery to latch onto — can go a long way while we wait.\n(Worth reminding: if Dragon's Dogma is more your speed, Capcom is also hosting a 10th anniversary stream at the exact same time. I'm feeling reserved yet hopeful.)\nY'all ready for this?\nThe post Let’s watch the Final Fantasy VII 25th Anniversary Celebration appeared first on Destructoid.",

But even if you're not into going fast in an anime world, you should also take some time to check out the Neon White OSTs from Machine Girl that hit Bandcamp today.\nArtist Machine Girl composed not one, but two OSTs—or original soundtracks—for Neon White. They're the tunes that play in the background as you speed along, zipping from demon to demon and blazing through the outer limits of heaven. They're extremely good.\nCheck out this track, dubbed The Wicked Heart, from the first OST. It starts out at full throttle, with punchy drums and raw noise bleeding throughout the track. The melody drops in around the 1:13 mark and is one of my favorites in Neon White.\nNeon White OST 1 - The Wicked Heart by Machine Girl\nNeon White and catch some relaxed, easygoing beats. It's perfect for kicking back after a long day of setting records.\nNeon White OST 2 - The Burn That Cures by Machine Girl\nTracks like Bloody Sneakers, the theme for Neon Violet, almost remind me of early PlayStation days. I think of the Racing Lagoon soundtrack, and in the best way possible.\nNeon White OST 2 - The Burn That Cures by Machine Girl\nBeats to blast your record in half\nWhat I'm saying is, the Neon White OSTs are a jam. It's already a contender for best soundtrack of the year, in my book.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0b-qZTF0Mc\nAs for Neon White itself, it's great. I've spent the last week setting and then besting my times, competing with other early players along the way. It's anime as heck, like the sort of series you'd find on a VHS tape in the '90s at your local mom-and-pop rental place. Suffice to say, if you like going fast, Neon White is worth your time—and it's got some killer beats, too.\nThe post The Neon White OSTs are on Bandcamp, and they’re fantastic appeared first on Destructoid.",

We got a new game last year on Nintendo Switch, sure, but a big part of the fun is that initial discovery phase before you've got every zany \"think fast!\" task figured out. With that in mind, I may not be super into Atari, but the idea behind Atari Mania sounds great.\nAtari Mania has 150+ microgames built on the brand's legacy, from Pong to Adventure to Yars' Revenge. The team says that we'll \"never think of Bentley Bear the same way again.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QErw-mKwLg\nIn the game, you'll play as the Atari Vault caretaker, so there's a wider story element to bind the '70s- and '80s-inspired microgames together. There are \"dead pixels\" to stop.\nAs for the gameplay structure, it'll be a gauntlet of escalating microgames in a random order, culminating in boss battles. So you'll need to be quick and consistent to survive.\nBeyond today's trailer, Atari Mania developer iLLOGIKA also confirmed collectibles like \"vintage Atari art, posters, manuals, and fun facts,\" along with \"fully playable versions of remastered Atari classics\" that can be unlocked via challenges.\n[caption id=\"attachment_330595\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1920\"] One of many microgames. Note the timer bar at the bottom.[/caption]\nFor me, it's mostly going to come down to the individual microgames more than anything else — are they fun? Surprising? How deep are these cuts? That said, it's good to hear that there's more substance with collectibles, and the price seems reasonable enough.\nAtari Mania will launch on Steam, Nintendo Switch, and Atari VCS this summer for $19.99.\nThe post Atari Mania is a retro-fueled microgame collection appeared first on Destructoid.",

Interested parties can sign up for the new release ahead of its launch on iOS and Android platforms this summer.\nSet once again in the lavish lands of Orsterra, Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent will feature the fantasy RPG action and deep storytelling lore of the original 2018 adventure, stylized with that \"retro 2D sprites on 3D rendered backgrounds\" aesthetic that all of these mobile spin-offs tend to rock. Choose a party of \"Chosen Ones\" from the 64 available characters, before embarking upon a branching narrative packed with exploration, adventure, and oodles of juicy monster battles.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKYvONIJ3tE\n\"A few years prior to the events of Octopath Traveler, Orsterra is ruled by tyrants hungry for “wealth, power, and fame,\" reads an official blurb. \"While the tyrants’ desires have unleashed a bottomless darkness upon the world… there are those who resist the darkness. You will meet them while traveling the world as “the Chosen Ones” of a divine ring. What will you obtain, and what will you experience through this journey? Soon the story will lead you to the tyrants of the land.\"\nChampions of the Continent sports the stunning art style of its predecessor and features familiar and original tunes from series composer Yasunori Nishiki. Very unlike the original release, however, the mobile edition of Octopath Traveler is a free-to-play title that also features a variety of in-app purchases.

And ID@Xbox notes that these demos are not the average demos you'd usually see on stores. While those usually come from fairly completed games, the ones in ID@Xbox are more akin to \"show floor demos\" you might catch at PAX or something. Basically, these are early-stage projects, so be constructive if things seem a little rough.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBskR9Pcv7o\nThe full list of demos is arriving closer to June 21, but ID@Xbox showed four of them today. These include:\nBatora: Lost Haven: An isometric action game where you journey through colorful planets and fight to save Earth using your physical and mental superpowers.\nBroken Pieces: A time-based thriller that seems ideal for Control fans, where you have to solve the mystery of this bizarre French village.\nSevered Steel: One for the blood-pumping FPS fans, it's got bullet-time and destructible environments.\nTinykin: A Pikmin-style game that we've had our eye on for a while, with an incredible look and tons of little helpers.\nDozens of demos galore\nIt's already been a pretty good summer for demos. The Steam Next Fest is on right now, and there are a ton of upcoming projects to discover and add to your wishlist there.\nLast year's ID@Xbox demo event had some pretty great hands-on previews in the lineup too. Games like Tunic, Lake, Sable, and more were all part of the 2021 demo fest. It'll be exciting to see what pops up in this year's event.\nThe post ID@Xbox Summer Game Fest Demo event kicks off next week appeared first on Destructoid.",

It is available to download from the eShop today, priced at around $30.\nYou can check out a trailer for the fun-looking arcade blaster below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbFFTZ706ew\nIn the aftermath of a brutal world war, a fantastical, furry take on the planet has fully disarmed itself of all weapons in order to prevent such an atrocity from taking place again. Unfortunately, the skies are now under siege from an invading intergalactic force, The Gozareans, and with nowhere else left to turn, it is up to a party of retired pilots to take to the air in their vintage battle planes, squaring up against the invaders despite being both outmanned and severely outgunned.\nHorgihugh and Friends boasts cheerful, cartoonish artwork by industry veteran Kou (Shantae, Mega Man X2) and a rousing soundtrack composed by Motoaki Furukawa (Metal Gear, Policenauts). As animalkind's last hope, players will blast their way through six stages of pew-pew action, gathering power-ups, swiftly dodging a skyful of projectiles, and taking on a seemingly endless army of drones, captained by no less than 13 unique boss characters.\nI'd been hoping to get to this release for review, but the relentlessness of the Not-E3 news season has unfortunately prevented me from doing so.

          "description": "Stuffed Crust\nToday sees the launch of nostalgic smack-'em-up Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge, (you can check out our review right here), but while the Heroes in a Half-Shell have only just returned to the streets, fans are already poking the developer squad on the possibility of post-release DLC.\nIn an interview with Xbox Expansion Pass, Tribute Games' Yannick Belzil was asked about the possibility of alternate character skins, for example, the turtles' penchant for trilbies and overcoats. In a response that makes perfect sense, Belzil noted that the distinct animated style of Shredder's Revenge prevents the team from altering the sprites too much, and thus alternate costumes are unlikely to be on deck, now or at anytime in the future.\nhttps://youtu.be/GemOAwU-9fo\nHowever, following some misleading \"No DLC at all\"-style headlines, Dotemu's Cyrille Imbert took to Twitter to clarify that while there are currently no plans for post-launch content, factors such as public perception and player feedback could decide whether the team returns to Shredder's Revenge at some point in the future. I'm sure, right now, they'd just like to rest up after a job well done.\nPut simply: There are no DLC plans now. There could be in the future.\nTMNT: Shredder's Revenge is a solid and fun brawler, but there is room, should Dotemu decide, for additional modes — such as Time Attack, Boss Rush, Endless, or 1CC. The TMNT lore runs deep, so should Tribute Games choose to add extra stages and/or characters, it would be understandably welcomed by fans. But all of this is putting the cart well before the horse. The game isn't even a single day old yet. But for those players who prefer the chase to the catch (seemingly all modern video game fans), know that future content ideas haven't been flushed down the sewer just yet.\nTMNT: Shredder's Revenge launches today on PS4, PC, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post No plans but possibility of TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge DLC appeared first on Destructoid.",

On the games side of things, that includes a few freebies. And this year the lineup is pretty good, as Prime members can get a copy of Mass Effect Legendary Edition and some Star Wars games for the low, low price of free.\nIn an Amazon blog, the company reveals some of the games arriving as freebies for Prime Day. Mass Effect Legendary Edition is a big one, as that's all three Mass Effect games and their single-player DLC, packing the whole trilogy into one launcher.

          "description": "I hope it stays interesting that whole time\nThe jury is still out on Sonic Frontiers, as an array of takes are swirling from folks who have played it. For now, we can look at some facts. The Sonic Frontiers length is looking like \"20-30 hours\" according to director Morio Kishimoto (who spoke to IGN).\nNaturally, that length is variable. Kishimoto also claims that it'll take \"double\" that length to clear everything and go for 100%, and a \"character progression\" system (which involves a skill tree and leveling) is supposed to keep people playing through that journey. For reference, Sonic Forces (the last mainline 3D Sonic) is roughly four hours long, and it takes around 20-ish hours to fully 100% it. 3D Sonic games typically range from five to 10 hours depending on the entry, so \"20-30\" is a massive shift, due in part to the \"open world\" focus.\nIt's really easy to be skeptical of how this will turn out. Shifts to massive open worlds don't always work out, as \"character progression\" alone might not be enough to propel players through a 100% completion, much less one campaign clear. The entire world needs to be interesting as well, and offer unique sidequests as well as a general sense of wonder and firm level design to ground the exploration.\nBased on what we've seen, it's iffy whether or not that'll end up being the case. More so than anything, the open world design is the most make-or-break thing for me.\nThe post Sonic Frontiers boss says length will run you “20-30 hours” to finish appeared first on Destructoid.",

While the animation frames are clearly 1:1, the character model is, frankly, stunning. Tess looks far more her requisite years, with visual weathering yet steely reserve deserved of a woman who has fought, killed, and seen more than enough of her fair share of death during her time in the Boston zone.\nhttps://twitter.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1536854906056822785?s=20&t=TEyaELJ2-xWwocFh1_74mw\nTo be clear, I think that the original iteration of Naughty Dog's magnum opus is still a fantastic-looking title, but there's no denying the amazing upgrade on display in this brief clip. Responding to the fans who treated the reveal with positivity, the developer would confidently assure them that they \"ain't seen nothing yet.\" Does a Last of Us remake even need to exist? I'm not sure it does, personally, but that doesn't mean I can't appreciate when fine work has been done in the talented sphere of game development.\nThe Last of Us Part I is currently in development for PS5.

We'll see how it fares come July, but for now, I'm pretty happy with what Nintendo is showing off. And that includes this new beautiful Xenoblade Chronicles 3 song called \"A Life Sent On.\"\nShared by way of the Nintendo UK Twitter account, the track is described as a \"somber flute-based melody,\" which is played by \"off-seers\" in the universe (specifically Noah and Mio) to mourn people who have fallen in battle. Based on the small amount of lore we have, off-seers are tasked with some sort of guidance for a facet of the afterlife, and could potentially play a larger role in the narrative.\nFor now, I've listened to this particular Xenoblade Chronicles 3 song a bunch of times now (even when writing this!) and it's giving me extremely good vibes for how the game will turn out. Aesthetically it seems to be nailing everything it needs to, as that's arguably been one of the stronger points of the series from the start: outdoing other similar games on the same hardware.\nHopefully we get even more quality of life upgrades and a killer story. There's a lot to improve upon in the second core game mechanically.\nListen to the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 song A Life Sent On\nhttps://twitter.com/NintendoUK/status/1534828335804649474\n[Update: And another song just dropped!

The studio has been feeding the community a steady stream of tidbits ever since its official gameplay reveal during last week's Sony State of Play presentation. With the spirit of a parent holding their newborn baby, Capcom has excitedly rolled out character reveals, music videos, test sessions, and a wide variety of minor details and elements.\nDespite blatantly stating this past weekend that the developer would be going \"dark\" on the title, Capcom simply cannot help itself, offering up new clips and information pertaining to everyone's favorite Family Man, Guile — first revealed during Thursday's Summer Game Fest.

          "description": "A little frog on a big adventure\nFor years now, crowdfunding sites have been one of the best ways for indie games to secure development. Because fans get to directly support the projects they want made, we've seen some of the most creative and innovative titles of the past decade come from platforms like Kickstarter and Fig, including Outer Wilds, Undertale, and Hollow Knight, just to name a few. I'm always on the lookout to see what new games are up for funding, because you never know what hidden gems you'll find. This time, I'm trained on A Frog's Tale after spotting its Kickstarter campaign on Twitter, and it looks like it could be an indie darling in the making.\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/normanfrog/a-frogs-tale\nA Frog's Tale is a retro RPG, with pixel art inspired by SNES and GBA classics, and gameplay inspired by titles like Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga, Kingdom Hearts, and Tales of Symphonia. It features musical turn-based combat and set pieces that are synched with the game's score, making for a truly unique experience.\nFrogs have been a recent trend in video games, and considering how adorable A Frog's Tale looks, you certainly don't see me complaining about it. The whole thing looks incredibly polished and sleek, and while we only have a few short clips of gameplay so far, it's already feeling like it has what it takes to stand out from the crowd.\nA Frog's Tale went up on Kickstarter last week (four days ago as of the writing of this post), and it will probably meet its $60,000 goal in the next few hours. There's still nearly a month left for the funding campaign, so the future is looking bright for this game. There are some pretty great rewards available for backing A Frog's Tale, so if it seems like something you'd be into, I definitely recommend checking it out.\nThe post A Frog’s Tale could be the newest crowdfunded indie darling appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "\"My Friends Are My Power!\"\nWhen Tetsuya Nomura retires, he'll have one hell of a career to look back on. Not all of it landed for everyone, but his work has had a major impact on so many people: notably, his stewardship of the Kingdom Hearts franchise. Nomura opened up about several facets of the Kingdom Hearts series in an interview with Game Informer: and shared an interesting behind the scenes tidbit about Sora in Smash Ultimate.\nWe already learned that Sora ended up in the game due to a \"chance meeting\" with a Disney rep, but now Nomura confirms that he was actually more \"picky\" than Disney was in regards to his appearance. Nomura notes that he was \"obviously happy\" that Disney would acquiesce and allow the character to appear, and \"[couldn't] believe that Disney okayed him to be in [the] game.\" But once the deal was ready to go, Nomura admits that while Disney was gung-ho, he was the one who had reservations.\nNomura was concerned about his ability to pull it off, \"because it might clash with he established lore in Kingdom Hearts and Disney worlds,\" (it's wacky enough, no worries there!) and had to \"consider [it] very carefully.\" But he doesn't regret it one bit, seeing the positive reaction overall to what ended up being the final [for now] Kingdom Hearts DLC character.\nSora definitely made a splash, and it's safe to say that he and the Smash team made the right choice. It's also cute to see Nomura so humbled by the crossover. Through thick and thin, and all the ups and downs the series has had, it's clear he still cares about it.\nThe post Nomura had more reservations about Sora in Smash than Disney appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Make good choices at Digimon camp\nThe long-awaited Digimon Survive got a new trailer today, highlighting both its tactics and its story ahead of its July 29 launch. There are dangers, decisions, and a whole lot of Digivolution.\nDigimon Survive is one-part visual novel mystery adventure, following a character lost in the world of Digimon. These sections seem to follow the cast of humans as they venture around, trying to figure out what's happened and how to get back home.\nThen, once a battle breaks out, it gets tactical. Digimon battles happen on a grid system with turn-based tactical fights. And yes, the Digimon can evolve into wild, wacky new Digimon.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLiTAk9TyUk\nThe mix of mystery and tactics certainly seems interesting. And I can't help but be drawn in when the trailer shows a chart of Digivolutions with all kinds of crossing arrows and paths.\n\nDigimon are the champions\nThe tactical story-driven Digimon Survive has been in the works for quite a long time, with quite a few delays. Then, earlier this year, the team finally locked a firm date for it on July 29.\nWith such a long road to launch, I'd hope Digimon fans find what they're looking for in Survive. Other Digimon games like Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth have flown under the radar, but been pretty solid.\nThe tactical take and incorporation of adventure game elements in Survive really intrigues me, even as someone who isn't the biggest Digimon fan. (I did really like Our War Game, though.)\nHopefully the wait's been worth it. Digimon Survive will launch on July 29 for PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam.\nThe post Digimon Survive shows off its choices and tactics ahead of July launch appeared first on Destructoid.",

According to a new report from the Tinseltown insiders over at Deadline, Columbia Pictures is scoping a summer 2023 release date for the fast and furious movie adaptation.\nDirected by Neil Blomkamp, (the big chair behind the great District 9 and the abominable CHAPPiE), Gran Turismo has something of a strange plot concept. Reportedly, the movie will follow the exploit of the world's greatest Gran Turismo player, who transitions their digital racing skills onto the real-world professional car racing circuit. Think The Last Starfighter, but without the world-saving angle.\nAs cheesy as that premise sounds, it is, surprisingly, an adaptation of a true story. British racing driver Jann Mardenborough legitimately won a Nissan-sponsored GT Academy contest in 2011, securing themselves a scholarship in the Nissan’s Driver Development Programme. Since the competition, Mardenborough has gone on to compete in numerous major race tournaments including Japan's GT Super series and the famous 24-hour Le Mans rally.\nPersonally, I prefer my driving movies to focus on people in pleather flame trousers stealing DVD players, but each to their own. Gran Turismo is the latest in a series of film and TV adaptations based on PlayStation properties. Live-action takes on The Last of Us, God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Twisted Metal are already in the works, while the Tom Holland vehicle Uncharted launched earlier in 2022.\nGran Turismo is tentatively scheduled to arrive in theaters August 11, 2023.\nThe post Gran Turismo movie adaptation coming August 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

To be eligible, you needed to have previously bought and registered (the second point is salient, it can't be sitting in a closet somewhere), your service account needs to be inactive (without a sub), and you needed to have been inactive for \"at least 30 days.\" If all of that is true, you can log back into the game and play. For a limited period of time.\nYep, note the second proviso! The login period begins \"four days including the day on which users first log in.\" That period will unilaterally end on the \"fourth login day\" at 11:59PM PT. This starts after you login, not when you zone in and start doing something, so make it count.\nAs long as you're aware of the eligibility and the login restrictions, you should be fine. Just maybe do it on a lazy Thursday/Friday so you have the entire weekend to spare! My advice: use this Final Fantasy free login period to potentially finish up wherever you left off on the main story quest (MSQ).

Yep, no Sonic kissing confirmed.\nSpeaking to Axios (via IGN), Sonic Frontiers producer (and long-time Sega designer) Takashi Iizuka mused on the issue when it was brought up, stating: \"I don't think we'll be doing that again.\" Iizuka has a clean conscience when it comes to the game in question too, as he didn't even work on it — instead opting to direct Shadow the Hedgehog, Sonic Riders, and Sonic Rivals around that same time. Iizuka also points out that two of the main Sonic rules are still in effect: including the obvious \"go fast\" rule, and the \"he can't swim\" rule.\nFor reference, the scene in question is from Sonic 2006, when Sonic the Hedgehog kissed a human woman. It was immediately clowned on directly after release, and when coupled with the fact that the game itself was one of the most egregious entries in the \"3D\" saga, it's one of the only notable things that anyone talks about when referencing the infamous 2006 game.\nThe post Sonic NOT kissing a human girl confirmed for Sonic Frontiers appeared first on Destructoid.",

Tribute Games and Dotemu’s throwback to the classic TMNT brawlers is out today, and a group of Game Informer editors will tackle the game live on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central.\nShredder’s Revenge is a new adventure inspired by the 1987 TMNT cartoon. Up to six players team up to battle over a dozen stages to fold Shredder’s evil schemes. If you’re a fan of brawlers, Shedder’s Revenge hits all the right notes. In my 8.75 out of 10 review, which you can read here, I described the game as a “polished, raucously fun throwback that plays better than how I remember the original games.”\nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

Events like Steam's Next Fest even let us get our hands on playable slices to better understand what these games are and how they play. Starting next week, Xbox will again be offering playable demos for indie titles in a week-long event that console players can dive into and experience the near future for indie gaming.\nThe ID@Xbox Summer Game Fest Demo Event will run from June 21 through June 27 and includes over 30 game demos for gamers to try out. In the blog post announcing the event, Xbox reminds readers that these are the equivalent of \"show floor\" demos and are a work in progress. Each of the participating demos will only be available during the days of the demo event and will be taken down after. Because these games aren't complete yet, the blog also asks players to share their feedback with developers to help make the best game possible.\nXbox isn't ready to share the full list of games for the event yet but did provide four titles that will be included.\nBatora: Lost Haven\nBroken Pieces\nSevered Steel\nTinykin\nSome of these game demos are available through Steam Next Fest (or are out on PC already), so if you have a capable PC and can't wait until next week, you can take a peek at these games early.",

Bethesda also revealed additional information about the game, including details about its different characters, co-op, and more. \nFollowing that reveal, Redfall game designer Harvey Smith spoke to IGN in a new interview about the title’s co-op and how it works. Here, Smith revealed that Redfall’s campaign progress is tied to the host of the co-op party and that it’s only persistent for that host, as reported by GamesRadar. This means that if you’re teaming up with someone to play co-op and you’re not the host, you will not receive the campaign progress they might after completing a level. \n\n\n“So for the flow of things, you want to have to redo those,” Smith said. “The story would be very confusing if you got to mission eight and it said, ‘skip this one because you’ve already done it.'\"\nSmith said that Arkane initially tried to give every player some “credit” for completing a given level when they aren’t the host. However, this didn’t work out, as those same players would then run into that same mission again when playing solo or as the host of their own co-op session. However, Smith told IGN that character progression aspects such as loot and XP would carry over to your campaign. \nOf course, with Redfall recently delayed out of 2022 and into 2023, things could change. In the meantime, watch Bethesda’s thrilling and bloody Redfall gameplay recently revealed, and then catch up on all the biggest gaming news from the 2022 Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase. \n[Source: IGN via GamesRadar]\nAre you going to play Redfall solo or in co-op?

          "description": "Bethesda and Xbox gave Starfield the spotlight during its recent weekend showcase, revealing more than 15 minutes of new footage and information from director Todd Howard. \nThe studio didn’t mention this during the showcase, but shortly after, the Bethesda Game Studios Twitter account revealed some new details about dialogue in Starfield and how your created character – the protagonist of the game – interacts with NPCs. In short, speaking to NPCs will happen in first-person, and your character will remain silent as they do not have a voice.\nYes, dialogue in @StarfieldGame is first person and your character does not have a voice. pic.twitter.com/A8384m6rGN\nJune 13, 2022\nAs you can see in the tweet above, the studio has cleared up some possible confusion around the created character we’ll all be playing in Starfield. This reveal has been praised by some and criticized by others. Some Bethesda fans prefer the studio’s RPGs where you remain silent, while others prefer their character to have a voice they can hear in-game. \nI’m cool with either. I hope Starfield’s dialogue is more akin to Fallout 3 than Fallout 4, though. In the former, you’d see essentially all of the dialogue your choice would result in, whereas in Fallout 4, your choices were more like mood options, giving just a general view of that choice’s dialogue. It took away some of my character’s agency, and I’m hoping Starfield restores that a bit. Only time will tell for now, though. \nStarfield will hit Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC sometime in 2023.\nFor more, read Game Informer’s Starfield analysis after its recent gameplay showing, and then check out this story about Todd Howard confirming that Fallout 5 is the next game Bethesda Game Studios will develop after Elder Scrolls 6 (which is the next game the studio will release after Starfield). \nWhat are your thoughts on Bethesda RPG dialogue?

          "description": "In a video interview with IGN, Bethesda’s Todd Howard divulged additional details about Starfield. He also uttered the name “Fallout 5” and gave an idea of when fans can expect to see it. \nSpeaking to Ryan McCaffrey, Howard confirmed that Fallout 5 will be the next game after The Elder Scrolls 6, which itself has entered pre-production:\n\"Yes, Elder Scrolls 6 is in pre-production and, you know, we’re going to be doing Fallout 5 after that, so our slate’s pretty full going forward for a while. We have some other projects that we look at from time to time as well.\"\nFollowing up on Starfield’s big gameplay demonstration at the Xbox + Bethesda Showcase, Howard revealed additional facts about the new IP. Starfield's main story is 30-40 hours long, or 20% larger than any Bethesda game to date. New Atlantis, one of Starfield’s four main cities and capital of the United Colonies, is also the largest city Bethesda has ever made. For character creation, Howard states there are roughly 20 character backgrounds to choose from. \nThe game’s procedural galaxy features the most hand-made content ever made by the studio. Boasting over 1000 planets that players can visit, Howard also clarified you cannot fly to each one seamlessly a la No Man’s Sky, describing the on-the-ground action and space gameplay as two separate experiences. In terms of space combat, Howard discusses how dogfighting (which he describes as having a slower pace) takes cues from games like FTL and MechWarrior and confirms that players can steal the ships they board. \nStarfield launches in 2023 for Xbox Series X/S and PC. \n[Source: IGN]",

While many of us will likely never get our hands on some of these unless we actually go to the show or find a vendor online, they're always fun to look at. This year, Funko is releasing a series of SDCC-exclusive Pop! figures. Game Informer can exclusively reveal the Pop Games: Sonic – Super Sonic First Appearance vinyl figure.\nThis version of Super Sonic features the ability to glow in the dark, paying tribute to his signature golden aura from the games, TV shows, comics, and movies. This vinyl figure stands at approximately 5.3 inches and gives the appearance it's floating above its stand. While I haven't seen the figure in person, the floating illusion probably combines with the glow-in-the-dark feature to create a cool effect when the lights dim.\n\nThis San Diego Comic-Con exclusive Funko Pop! figure comes in a box with either a \"2022 Summer Convention Exclusive\" sticker or the \"2022 San Diego Comic-Con\" sticker on the box. Despite the image in the gallery above featuring the latter, the sticker on the box isn't guaranteed. This year marks the iconic convention's grand return to the San Diego Convention Center for the first time since 2019. San Diego Comic-Con runs from July 21 to July 24.",

          "description": "Despite not having a trailer at the main Xbox and Bethesda showcase this weekend, eagle-eyed viewers may have spotted a popular survival title alongside the 2023 Xbox releases in an image near the show's end. Today it was confirmed that inclusion was very intentional, as Valheim is not only coming to Game Pass on PC this fall but will be coming to consoles and will be exclusive to Xbox when it launches in 2023.\n\n\nThe Norse-themed cooperative survival game was released into Early Access on Steam in February of last year when it quickly blew up in popularity, selling over 3 million copies in its first few weeks on sale. For people like myself who never took the plunge on Valheim, its addition to PC Game Pass in a few months is a welcomed sight, as is its inclusion in the Microsoft Store on Windows.\nThe other big news for Valheim is three-fold. First, the game is officially coming to consoles for the first time. There has been talk of its eventuality since controller support was added to the PC version earlier this year, but it's nice to finally have confirmation. When this port does land on Xbox sometime in the first half of 2023, full cross-play will be enabled to team up with any number of PC and console players. Although, no other consoles will be involved since Microsoft has locked down console exclusivity for Valheim, so don't expect to see the game show up on PlayStation or Switch anytime soon.\nIf you can't wait until Valheim joins Game Pass on your Microsoft platform of choice, it's available to purchase right now on Steam.",

To hold fans over, the team released a new cinematic during today's Xbox Games Extended Showcase.\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 was slated to launch on December 2, but development was put on hold when the studio became caught in the crossfire of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. GSC Game World is based in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital and some employees have helped defend the city. Given the situation, it seemed increasingly unlikely the game would make it this year, so today’s announcement isn’t totally unexpected. Although GSC is still working out of Kyiv, most of the game's development has resumed at a new office established in Prague, Czech Republic.\nMeanwhile, a new trailer further establishes S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2's gloomy atmosphere.  \n\n\nIn addition, a developer diary documents the state of GSC Game World during the start of Russia's invasion and how it banded together amidst days of bombings (contains disturbing imagry of the war so viewer discretion is advised).\n\n\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl will launch on Xbox Series X/S and PC.",

Moving away from other classic heavyweights like Doom and Wolfenstein, Rare's acclaimed James Bond FPS opted for aesthetic realism, intense single-player campaign levels, deep stealth mechanics with cognizant AI, and, of course, PvP deathmatch. GoldenEra, an upcoming GoldenEye 007 documentary, spotlights the development of the influential FPS. \n\n\nThe trailer, uploaded on IGN, features snippets of developer insight into the creation of GoldenEye 007. Designers stated that, at one point, FPS titles were primarily made for PC audiences. GoldenEye, of course, made waves when it found critical and commercial success on consoles. Next-gen game-changers like Halo and Call of Duty, then, were directly informed by the tight gunplay and combat mechanics of GoldenEye. Be sure to watch the trailer above for more insight. \nGoldenEra will be available digitally this month on June 27.\n[Source: IGN]",

A new game plus option was implemented months ago, and optimization updates keep the gameplay fine-tuned and responsive. Post-launch plans continue to be underway as a new update – 1.4.0 – drops today with the first \"Chapter,\" bringing photo mode and new zombies to the open-world parkour adventure. \nSo, what are the most significant features coming to the game today? A post on the Dying Light website details the introduction of a new NPC named Harper, a rank system to help players build a rapport with Harper as they complete his tasks, daily/weekly bounties, more high-tier gear, two new currencies, never-before-seen infected enemies like the Mutated Infected, Volatile Tyrant, and Volatile Hive, and a time trial Chapter Mission. \nOf course, there's also the photo mode (only available in single-player) that comes with filters, special effects, and more. Other tweaks are incoming to help balance and streamline the fun – we're talking gameplay, co-op, UI/UX, and technical updates. Read all about it by clicking the link in the previous paragraph. \nLike its prequel, Dying Light 2 Stay Human is set to get much developer support even as Techland begins developing its new fantasy action-RPG.

          "description": "Monster Hunter Rise kicked off the Capcom Showcase today, with new locations for hunters to explore on full display, along with plenty more monsters to take the fight to when the expansion releases. A demo will also be available starting tomorrow.\nFirst off is the return of the Jungle area from the second generation of Monster Hunter, which has been completely redone for Sunbreak. While the Jungle sounds like it would be strictly filled with trees and other foliage, it's situated on the coast and offers plenty of sandy beaches and ruins to explore.\n\n\nAs for new monsters to hunt, Sunbreak has a lot of exciting new targets to take on. Espinas makes its return from Monster Hunter Frontiers. As its name implies (\"espinas\" is Spanish for thorns), this creature is covered in sharp spines that wi…",

          "description": "Capcom leveraged its summer showcase event today to reveal some new details on Exoprimal, the upcoming action and shooting game in which players control warriors in exosuits as they fight off rampaging hordes of dinosaurs. An out-of-control AI called Leviathan is unleashing these dinosaurs through rifts in the sky, and forcing humans to fight them off in intricate (and frankly inexplicable) wargames – usually at high risk of death and destruction of urban landscapes.\nExoprimal's main event is called Dino Survival, where you join up in a multiplayer team of five and compete against another team to complete very specific objectives.\n\n\nThose mission objectives are varied and dynamic. In Dinosaur Cull, your team must hunt and take down one specific dinosaur. VTOL Defense demands that your team protect an aircraft on the ground as it gets swarmed by the charging reptiles. Data Key Security is an escort-style mission, in which you must deliver a particular asset from one location to the next. Omega Charge is a mission in which players have access to a swarm-clearing Omega Hammer. And Energy Taker, as you might suspect, is all about gathering more energy than the opposing team.\nInterestingly, Exoprimal will include sequences where you directly engage enemy players, but also moments where you team up to take down especially dangerous threats. No matter who you’re fighting against, you’ll earn XP to power up both your player character and their exosuit levels.\nCapcom shared that Exoprimal will soon enter a closed network test, which should allow players to get a taste of the action. If you’re interested, you can sign up at exoprimal.com.\nExoprimal is targeting a release on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, and Steam, sometime in 2023.",

          "description": "Today during the Capcom Showcase livestream, the company touched base on its recently-announced Resident Evil 4 remake – including showing all of a few seconds of gameplay. Admittedly, especially coming off the other deep dives of the presentation, it was pretty disappointing. \nDirector Yasuhiro Anpo and producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi led the presentation, filling players in on the story of RE4 and talking about how the game is both a reimagining of the source material and a faithful adaptation. Set six years after the events of Resident Evil 2 and 3, RE4 protagonist Leon Kennedy is now the personal bodyguard of the United States president. When the president's daughter goes missing, Leon is dispatched to a remote European village to find her. As you might expect, things don't go well. \n\n\nWe then see our first look at gameplay, and to be clear, visually, it looks great. The footage is set during the very beginning of the game, when Leon arrives outside the village in the forest. Compared to the original game, the forest is far darker and scarier. \"We want to nail the feeling of loneliness and fear of not knowing what lies ahead, even more so than the original,\" Hirabayashi said during the presentation. \"Of course, there will also be thrilling battles.\"\nYou'd be excused if you expected a glimpse at those thrilling battles, but unfortunately, no such look came. Our look at gameplay ends as Leon walks up to a house in the middle of the forest – which ostensibly is where Leon encounters the first Ganado, as is the case in the original RE4. \nI'm more excited for the Resident Evil 4 remake than any other game we currently know about; the original is one of my all-time favorite games. Which makes this reveal fairly disappointing. I would've loved an actual look at the game, but that wasn't in the cards today. Here's hoping we'll get a better look in the future.",

          "description": "Resident Evil Village made a surprise return during today's Capcom Showcase. After revealing the game has sold over six million copies worldwide, Capcom revealed a Gold Edition is on the way, boasting a number of notable additions. First up is a new story expansion called Shadows of Rose, which puts Rose in the lead for a mind-bending journey of discovery.\n\n\nIn this story, Rose, who is the daughter of Ethan, is in her teens or twenties. From the outset of play, you learn she's struggling with her powers. To try and control them, she enters the consciousness of the Megamycete and that's where the madness begins. Time and space are warped and she sees someone that looks just like her. The entire game is set from the third-person perspective.\nCapcom is adding that new viewpoint to the core game, allowing players to see Ethan and experience the game much like Resident Evil 4 with over-the-shoulder aiming.\nLastly, Mercenaries mode is getting fleshed out with new missions and playable characters like Chris Redfield, Alcina Dimitrescu, and Karl Heisenberg. Lady Dimitrescu stands in at over nine feet in height.\nIf you already played through Resident Evil Village, you won't have to buy this Gold Edition and will just need to get the new Winter's Expansion, which contains all three additions. Capcom is planning to release this content on October 28.",

          "description": "After a release in Asian markets last month, the overhaul of PlayStation Plus is available today in North and South America. Here's everything you'll need to know about upgrading your plan.\nThree tiers are now available, offering larger numbers of features, games, and trials to play as you go up in pricing, which is available in one-month, three-month, and 12-month subscriptions. Brief descriptions of what you get in each tier can be found below. \nUpgrading is fairly painless but will require a prorated upcharge to join the new Extra or Premium plans of PlayStation Plus. To do so, go to your PS+ tab on your PlayStation console. There, you'll find an option to upgrade. On PS5, it showed each tier and how much money it would cost to upgrade for the remainder of the month, which for most should only be a few dollars. Upon upgrading, it will tell you your next payment date and that it will charge you for a full-year subscription on that day. Don't panic. There is a way to change your subscription type. \nHow To Change Your Subscription Type From Yearly To Monthly\nThere are various ways of getting to your subscription settings, but here is the most foolproof. Go to the Settings menu for your PlayStation console, select Users and Accounts > Accounts > Payment and Subscriptions > Subscriptions. In there, you'll find your PS+ subscription. Once you've entered your subscription details, you can change your plan. \nSelecting Change Plan will give you the three tiers of PlayStation Plus to choose from. Picking any of them will bring you to another screen that will finally allow you to choose the length of subscription you'd like to pay for on a recurring basis. \nOnce you've locked in your desired subscription tier and timeframe, you're ready to enjoy all of the benefits that are now available to you, and you can rest easy knowing you're not locked in for an unexpected charge next month.",

Rotwood is a multiplayer action game, and it's expected to enter early access at some point, but that date is up in the air for now.\n\n\nThanks to the Steam description, we know a little more about Rotwood than what was revealed in the trailer. It's a roguelike dungeon crawler designed to be played with up to four people. Each run will bring your cute animal avatars through a dangerous forest where the challenge amplifies the deeper you go in. New armor and weapons can be crafted from items scavenged, and a safe haven can be built up and fortified as well.\nIn typical Klei style, the hand-drawn look of the characters and enemies is unreal. Once again, the studio is pushing the boundaries of making it look like you're controlling a cartoon character; Rotwood's models are expressive, fluid, and bursting with personality. I can't wait to see what Rotwood looks and plays like in action when I can eventually get my hands on it.\nThe trailer gave an early access date of \"202?\" which could be anytime in the next decade, though I'd expect us to play it well before 2030. Rotwood can be wishlisted on Steam, and it's unknown whether Klei is planning for release on any additional platforms at this time.",

SHODAN, the antagonistic AI who is ever-present in System Shock, is also a prominent feature in the trailer as she talks smack to the player as they explore the Citadel Station.\nSystem Shock is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

The Alters is a sci-fi adventure where one man trying to survive and get home from a mission that's gone wrong finds all the help he needs in himself. Or rather, himselves.\n\n\n \nJan Dolski, the main character, turns to The Alters, or alternate versions of himself that differ from him in ways that will help them all survive. The Alters each have different skills and character traits, so even though they all look like Jan, they'll fill specific roles in the mission to get home. The trailer shows Jan and The Alters' ship, a giant wheel-like craft with a series of shipping container units held together at the center.\nDuring the presentation, 11 Bit Studios' Lead Artist Tomasz Kisikewicz says the game has aspects of a psychological thriller, with a dash of horror, but also obviously deals with surrealism. He also says this lands in a \"classic sci-fi\" story by taking a relatable topic and applying these fictional science solutions like creating alternate selves, but the gameplay is contemporary with a focus on system design and non-linear gameplay. It's designed for players to create their own stories.\n \n\nIt seems like it's far too early for a release date, but we do know The Alters will be coming to PC whenever it does end up launching.",

What was shown is compelling, and it may be an understatement to say, but this game looks stunning.\n\n\nThe demo begins from the perspective of Yasna, a hazmat-suited explorer as she ventures into a dusty and irradiated facility. Her cohort Novik supports her on comms as she delves deeper into the mysterious local. She soon comes across a deactivated Antimatter cannon and later a robot looping a task it's been engaged in for who knows how long. The tech of The Invincible is retro-futuristic, which gives the rundown facility and gadgets Yasna uses a lot of character and charm. Yasna pulls out a handheld tracker with a field of tiny lights and uses it to discover a body buried in the sands beneath her feet, confirming this place isn't at all safe. Then, the antimatter cannon surges to life, takes aim, and blows the robot worker away with a spectacular beam of particles before turning its sights dead on our protagonist.\nI'm not usually one for slow-paced first-person narrative games, but this look at The Invincible had me on the edge of my seat, and I can't wait to see more. The Invincible is coming sometime in 2023 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

          "description": "Obsidian Entertainment, the studio behind 2019’s The Outer Worlds, has revealed Pentiment, a beautiful narrative journey through 16th Century Bavaria. It is coming to Xbox consoles and PC this November. \nRevealed during today’s Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase, Pentiment looks like quite the departure from what Obsidian has released over the past few years. Nonetheless, the project looks fascinating. The game features quite a unique visual style that looks reminiscent of an old medieval painting or book. This makes sense, too, because Pentiment is not an RPG like The Outer Worlds or a survival game like the studio’s Grounded, but rather, a narrative adventure game. \nCheck out the trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nHere’s how Xbox describes Pentiment in the YouTube trailer description: \n“Set in 16th century Bavaria, Pentiment will take players on a narrative journey through the eyes of Journeyman Artist Andreas Maler during a time of great social unrest. Led by game director Josh Sawyer, this game is brought to life by a talented team inspired by illuminated manuscripts, woodcut prints, and history itself.” \nPentiment hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC this November. \nWhile waiting for its release, read Game Informer’s review of The Outer Worlds and then read about Obsidian’s next RPG, Avowed.\nAre you excited for Pentiment?

The trailer, which was captured in-game, not only looked intriguing but also revealed the game's launch date. And it's next month!\nOn July 19, you can gear up with friends or solo to experience a story of \"betrayal, sacrifice, and resilience.\" The trailer, which you can watch above, sheds light on some of the dilemmas and challenges you'll have to navigate in a small town. It makes statements like, \"Sometimes doing the right thing is doing the wrong thing.\" The narrative-driven game will explore the entangled lives of two families across thirty years, and it looks like three characters, in particular, are at the forefront of the experience.\nThe multiplayer lets you have up to eight players, but it's unclear how each person will actually be involved in the process. \nGuess we'll know soon enough when As Dusk Falls launches on July 19 for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC. The game is also a day-one title on Xbox Game Pass.",

He also spoke briefly about Microsoft’s cloud technology, suggesting that the project might leverage that capability as well.\nIt’s not much to go on, but it’s an interesting new direction for the studio and auteur, as Kojima has more recently been connected to Sony and its PlayStation brand.\nIt will be especially interesting to see what shape this new project will take as we learn more, but that may be quite a long way off from now.",

The gameplay footage showed her stealthily outsmarting big machines and using an array of powers. She can also stab them through the head, so that's pretty cool.

During the platform's Summer Game Fest event today, we got our first glimpse at a new project from Limbo and Inside lead designer Jeppe Carlsen.\nCocoon, published by Annapurna Interactive, which has a showcase of its own next month, promises to be a mind-bending experience with an undeniably compelling art style. The creators promise to take players \"on an adventure across worlds within worlds,\" which are represented by a series of unusual glowing orbs in the trailer. The clip begins with a sweeping and stylized view of a desert landscape which is soon disturbed by a blinding beam of white light. Our hero pops out of a mechanical-looking cocoon energized by the laser and appears to be a kind of beetle. We mostly see it grabbing and distributing globes of various colors, which may allow it to jump to different locations.\n\n\n There's not a lot to glean from this reveal trailer, but the game's Steam page goes into a little more detail. \nCocoon is set to release on Xbox consoles (via Game Pass), Switch, and PC sometime in 2023. The trailer's description indicates fans should get ready to \"master world-leaping mechanics to unravel a cosmic mystery.\"",

Some of these story moments could lead to massive boss battles that require numerous players.\n\n\nDiablo IV offers cross-play between console and PC, and also two-player couch play for people in the same household.

His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools. By implementing more internal functions used by DIRECTOR, Pragyansh's main objective is to extend support for Meet Mediaband and The Journeyman Project (Win and Mac), making them fully playable without any glitches.\nMichael Hayman (aka Quote58) is about to implement support for The Immortal. The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.\nEmanuele Grisenti (aka grisenti) will be working on a new engine, HPL1. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer Frictional Games under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game Penumbra: Overture.\nAvijeet Maurya (aka StableSteady) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet's task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.\nThe team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.\nPlease give a warm welcome to our new students! Let's make GSoC 2022 a huge success – together!\n>",
