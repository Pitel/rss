          "description": "Are you planning to Have A Nice Death?\nThe industry just loves games about death, doesn't it? We've seen the grim reaper take up the scythe in multiple games, from the expletive and squeaky in Conker's Bad Fur Day to the 'travel agent' Manny Calavera from Grim Fandango. And now, Magic Design Studios is taking up the black cloak with Have A Nice Death, a roguelike all about corporate burnout and the cycle of death, all with an absurdist humour twist.\nBoasting stunning hand-drawn visuals, Have a Nice death is stylish, silly, and stuffed full of snappy combat. You'll get to explore Death, Inc. as the CEO of the company, Death himself, as you try and get your employees into shape. Some employees are reaping too many souls, while others are overindulging. So Death needs to put his (skeletal) foot down and march through the ever-changing offices.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Square Enix DE has partnered up with a German miniature train exhibition in Hamburg to recreate one of Octopath Traveler II's most memorable scenes — and it's really rather lovely.\nThe staff at Miniatur Wunderland, the largest model railway and airport exhibition in the world, have created the campfire scene which adorns the game's box art in lovely minifigure form. All eight travellers — Ochette, Castti, Throné, Osvald, Partitio, Agnea, Temeons, and Hikari — are gathered together, tucked among the trees, each with their own little figure.

Nintendo published its own advert for the upcoming release just last week, but those after a real throwback might want to check out the game's original commercial from 2002 — the director's cut of which can be seen above in HD.\nThis version differs from the one that originally aired back in 2002, containing some extra shots of Samus powering up and with a slightly different voiceover amongst other little changes. The longer cut was uploaded to YouTube by Shinesparkers after being shared by the trailer's original director, Bruce Hunt. In all of its glorious HD, it stands today as a proper blast from the past — just look at those costumes.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "As I have complained about mightily in the past, I grew up somwhere that didn't have much in the way of entertainment, so me and my friends had to engage in the time honoured tradition of making our own fun. Once we reached about age 17 this included playing poker with a shared second-hand chip set, and trying to do beer centurions (the progress in the latter affecting our interest in the former). I was never any good at it because, though poker was a fixture for several years, I was never really able to learn the rules. What hand is good? Why has your hand beaten his hand? But the little pictures are the best, I don't understand! It's disappointing because understanding poker is a cool adult thing, plus not understanding it makes certain pivotal scenes in James Bond films quite hard to parse.\nLast week we got an email (shout out Aidan) singing the praises of Aces And Adventures, and I do try to check out recommendations from readers, even if I don't have time to reply or to write about the games. In this case I've made a special because Aces And Adventures is a great game that is teaching me winning poker hands through the medium of a dwarven warrior smashing things.\nRead more",

I remember the hype around it very clearly because Gamestation had a deal where you could buy it for like £22, and I had a sideline going when the stock was low to keep some back for my friends. Apols if you were caught in the crossfire for that, but dragon fever was running high off the back of a still very cool trailer, and shouting Fus Ro Dah was the only cure. \nIn the years since, Skyrim has been released and re-released many times, on every conceivable platform. \"Arrow to the knee\" jokes became de rigueur and hacky almost overnight, and at this point might have horse-shoed back around to being funny again. There are many examples of unrelated games or videos that cut to black fading back up into the opening of Skyrim, in a kind of sub-genre of rickroll. Does it hold up now? Kind of. It's a really fun, ambitious RPG, with faults - but if the faults didn't exist maybe it wouldn't have been as popular as it was.\nRead more",

This was obviously a real treat for me as RPS' resident Sims fanatic, but I'll admit I went in with my expectations parked in neutral. After all, the theme of this new-content duo is young families, and that just isn't part of the game I engage with too much these days.\nRead more",

It's not that I dislike them. They've just never really made much impression (possibly because I don't see all that many)\nDestructure blends in a hint of shooting, resource management, and leans into the sheer fun of destruction, replacing bricks with \"structures\" that aren't meant to be anything specific, but give the whole feeling an impression of combat, an assault you're carrying out rather than a reacting, abstract geometry game.\nAlso it feels and sounds great to hit stuff.

It's been 15 years since I last visited family in Yokohama, and my last memory is one where I'm miserable and I'm staring out of a cab window going back to the airport. I didn't want to leave. It sounds corny as heck, but I can't wait to sucker punch that memory with a swing that's been building for 5478 days, then jab it full of happy ones. Really, I imagine what will happen is I'll get weirdly emotional as the plane touches down and my mate Simon, who I'm going with, will be like, \"Get a hold of yourself you buffoon\".\nI got LINE recently -  a Whatsapp equivalent that's big in Japan - to arrange some meetups with friends and family. Those arrangements have happened, which brings me great joy. But in a surprise plot twist, it meant I got back in touch with a guy called Sam. Now Sam, he's a good bud and we go a long way back. All the way back to the original Gears Of War days. And I think we've arranged, as is custom, to play Gears 6 whenever it arrives. Such is the bizarre way of things.\nRead more",

It was an insightful look at the nuts and bolts of game dev, so I’m glad Ninja Theory are returning to the concept for the spooky action sequel Hellblade 2: Senua’s Saga. The first episode takes a look at Iceland - the sequel's setting - and the team's painstaking commitment to recreating it as realistically as possible.

The 17 minute long video showcased various sections from the game, including a late-game boss fight and a greatly expanded early area that sees Leon exploring a series of creepy caves.\r\n\n\r\nAs Rock Paper Shotgun's Resident Resident Evil Liker, I took it upon myself to obsessively study each individual frame of this video file to uncover its hidden secrets. Surprising even myself, I was able to extract 17 new details about Leon's refreshed holiday to rural Spain. That's one new thing for each minute of the footage! That wasn't intentional!

And crucially, it's more approachable as a result. Clever ranks and meters reward, whether risk-taking is your jam or you're more of a careful type. It may still be a tricky venture filled with demonic, titanic cows that'll want to pound your skull into the dirt, but this is Team Ninja's most encouraging effort yet.\nRead more",

It just seemed like a fun thing to do… until I did it.” \r\n\n\r\nLaidlaw first discovered that community in the mid 90s, in the office of Valve, where Gabe Newell and team were already hard at work on Half-Life. “I’d seen bits and pieces of the levels they were working on, but as soon as I heard the name, I just got this amazing buzz,” Laidlaw says. “I could see the whole world they were aiming at somehow, and I felt it was a collective vision. This is one reason it’s so weird to me when people try to attribute authorship to me that I’ve never felt. It was all there when I got there, in embryo.”\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "One of the best things a survival game can do is make you want to share your latest experiences with your family and friends At this, Sons Of The Forest succeeds in grand fashion. Often I found myself pausing the game so I could go find my brother and tell him about the latest Big Thing that had just happened. Some of the time, it's even for the right reasons. Perhaps I'd spotted a group of cannibals adopting some startlingly intelligent behaviour. Or maybe one of my NPC companions had just done something particularly endearing in front of me.\nOr, more likely, I'd witnessed another example of the incredible jankiness which, like the island's flesh-nibbling denizens, loves to raid and pillage its way through nearly every aspect of the game. Perhaps I'd just cut down a tree and watched it soar high into the air, glitching all over the place like some demonic new type of tree mutant. Maybe Kelvin had just taken my instruction to gather logs a bit too literally, and deconstructed the entire west side of my house while I wasn't looking.\nSons Of The Forest's great strength is its ability to utterly transport you into its threatening, unsettling, but genuinely beautiful world. It quickly builds up the player's trust until they're ready to wholeheartedly buy into what at times feels like the next generation of open-world survival and crafting games. But then, at least in its current Early Access state, it breaks that trust just as quickly with a melange of unintuitive systems, game-breaking bugs, and a painful lack of content that makes one of the most gorgeous environments in games feel awfully hollow after a while.\nRead more",

That time is divided into five-second chunks during which you're shown what the enemy will do, and must use that to coordinate your own mechs, placing their orders on a visible timeline. You finish your turn by hitting a button that makes everyone go at once for a few explosive moments.\nIn practice, behind those few seconds are an eternity of theorising, testing, and tweaking. There's probably a metaphor in there somewhere about writing, video editing, or catering. The result is a game that's taken me absolutely ages, but whose numbers suggest I'm supposed to be blasting through without a care.\nI am enjoying it a lot, despite some frustration.\nRead more",

That’ll be either a GTX 1070 Ti or a Radeon RX 5600 XT. \r\n\n\r\nConsternation at the star-high starting specs prompted Private Division community lead Michael Loreno to pen a forum post explaining the requirements, suggesting they were subject to change as further optimisations are added and that \"the game is certainly playable on machines below our min spec.\" Sadly, I’ve been finding that several of the most-used GPUs among Steam users – including the immensely popular GTX 1060 – are likely to face serious performance woes in KSP2’s current state.\r\n\n \nRead more",

That's the case with this deal, where you can pick up Lexar's NS100 SATA SSD in a beautiful 1TB capacity for just £46. \nThat's a super low price for what is by all accounts quite a reasonable drive, with read speeds up to 550MB/s, write speeds up to 500MB/s, TLC NAND flash memory and a DRAM-less design. \nRead more",

A list of bugs longer than a Saturn V reads like a terrible medical diagnosis: quivering periapsis, unpredictable methane leakage, late-stage separation anxiety, loose payloads, non-stop burning, and sensitive nodes.\nThe developers, smiling bravely in circumstances presumably beyond their control, describe the launch as like dropping a kid off for their first day at school. Well the kid forgot their lunchbox, their uniform, their books and their pencil case. They showed up at the wrong school, on a Saturday during half-term. If you were stranded on a desert island and had to recreate Kerbal Space Program from memory using nothing but coconuts and string, it would look something like Kerbal Space Program 2. The game is nowhere approaching finished, it barely resembles the promotional videos, and it isn’t ready, even by Early Access standards.\nRead more",

The other two - the bulk of the game - weren't playable. Still, what I did play was simplistic fun that valued chaos over stealth, with middling results.

          "description": "“At some point,\" says Joel Jordan, \"Animal Crossing poses the question to you with alarming force: how do you want to spend your time?”\r\n\n\r\nAllow me to open with the scoundrel’s refuge that is a seemingly weighty dichotomy: I reckon there’s two really special types of indie games. Those that work wonderfully despite their smaller scope, and those that work wonderfully because of it. It’s that second kind - the particular and peculiar voyages into the miniature and mundane - that really spin wonders. Games like Unpacking, PowerWash Simulator, and Dinkum. Games humble enough in scope, and curious enough in outlook, to be uniquely capable of framing everyday experiences so that their inner oddness and strange magic - unfairly dulled by familiarity - shines. \r\n\n\r\nSo, when Jordon - solo dev on the upcoming Time Bandit - brings up the question: how do you want to spend your time? I’m left pondering it for far longer than I think I otherwise would, thinking about it in context. The obvious answer here is: playing an videogame, please. But Time Bandit’s free demo doesn’t take long to make me almost uncomfortably aware that there’s more than one way to play something. I don’t even need to be anywhere near the PC. I might actually be playing it more when I’m not [X-Files music, but also I’m going somewhere with this].\r\n\n \nRead more",

Pravidelná každoměsíční online setkání s diskuzí nad tématy ze světa vědy a techniky, zejména z praktického pohledu, často ale i s nadhledem a humorem, jejichž tradice vznikla za Covidového lockdownu. Tak jaká témata si bastlíři z projektu MacGyver.sh připravili na toto jubilejní 24. setkání? Určitě bude zmíněna statistika samotné Virtuální Bastlírny. Zajímalo by Vás kolik unikátních návštěvníků se v online prostoru bastlírenského Zoomu již sešlo a kolik bastlířo-hodin prodiskutovalo?\r\n\r\nZe světa HW pak kluci vyhrabali 100 MSa/s osciloskop postavený na RP2040, energeticky úspornou technologii pro přenos dat mezi senzory umístěnými na lidském těle, nové velice levné ARMy pod 5 Kč a nové procesory od ST, požár v továrně na čipy, falešné CO2 monitory, Raspberry debug probe, nový nástroj na tvorbu plošných spojů nebo blížící se semináře a webináře o elektronice.\r\n\r\nZa SW zase třeba zbrusu nový KiCAD 7.0.0, emulace zvukové karty Gravis Ultrasound na RP2040, probíhající standardizace šifrovacích algoritmů pro IoT, podpora Bluetooth v Rpi Pico SDK, jak se dělá raytracing na FPGA nebo spolupráce mezi projekty KiCAD a Inventree.\r\n\r\nAť už vás zaujalo cokoliv z nabízených témat, chcete ukázat nějaký svůj bastl a nebo si jen potřebujete postěžovat na nedostatek volného času, dorazte! Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v úterý 7. března od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

For those who wish to get fully up to speed, then an \"Ultimate Edition\", complete with Season Pass 1 & 2 as well as a fistful of special character colors, is available to purchase for a loftier $80. So if you want to play as post-release DLC characters such as Bridget, Goldlewis Dickinson, Happy Chaos, Baiken, or my main squeeze Testament, that's the version to bag.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN2XLp81_Ao&ab_channel=arcsystemworks\nGuilty Gear Strive is an effort by ArcSys to wind back the intricacies of the uber-deep fighter, hoping to wedge open the door a little for series newcomers. While this direction has admittedly met with some pushback from the long-time GG community, it can't be denied that Strive is the most approachable GG title in some years, and is the release to grab for anyone on the fence about this fine fighting series. For the old-schoolers, the excellent Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2 recently got updated netcode on Steam, so there's a GG out there and ready to rock for all y'all. C'mon, let's be pals.\nGuilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Xbox Game Pass. Check it out.\nThe post Guilty Gear Strive is now available on Xbox, Windows, and Xbox Game Pass appeared first on Destructoid.",

You manage a motley crew of misfits, all working together to stop the Banished Court cult from taking over the world.\nAs the tagline notes, \"Unfortunately, the best of the best are all gone, so now it's up to the best of the worst.\" Today's announcement trailer emphasizes that a bit, as your team are not quite pristine heroes, so much as endearing rapscallions.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=…",

The yo-yo swinging scrapper is available to pre-order now at Good Smile Co. and other anime-lovin' toy stores.\nProduced by legendary merch-makers Max Factory, Pop Up Parade Bridget stands a little under seven inches in height and is rocking her modernized Guilty Gear Strive look — standing in a cute 'n' coy pose with her \"Tricky Spinner\" in hand. Like her Pop Up brethren, Bridget is a static figurine with zero points of articulation or any accompanying accessories, but that doesn't mean that she isn't sporting some fine detail and great, vivid coloring.\n\nIf you want to pick up a Bridget for your bookshelf, then you can pre-order her now from the official Good Smile Co. website or whichever anime/gaming merchandiser is your turf. Bridget retails for around ¥5,500, (roughly $40 USD), not including any shipping or potential customs charges. She is expected to come rolling into your world later this summer.\nSince Bridget made her Guilty Gear return, our girl has become pretty popular on the merchandise market, with this adorable plush doll, also from Good Smile Co., and this devastatingly expensive replica of her iconic bullet yo-yo. Additionally, Bridget has featured highly in the realm of fan art projects, such as this cute PS1-style animation. She's most certainly on her way to becoming one of the franchise's most recognizable characters.\nGuilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation and PC platforms. An Xbox port will arrive this spring.\nThe post Guilty Gear Strive Bridget gets her own Pop Up Parade figurine appeared first on Destructoid.",

But before the doors close, Silver Falls series developer Sungrand Studios is getting one last launch on the Nintendo 3DS.\nSungrand has announced that two Silver Falls titles are headed to the Nintendo 3DS, in one bundle. Silver Falls Gaiden Deathly Delusion Destroyers and Silver Falls Ruby River both arrive on the digital storefront on March 9.\nThe two games will be bundled together into one for $16.99, going live only in North America on March 9. It doesn't sound like there are plans to create any physical copies at the moment, either. So you'll only have a narrow window of time before the 3DS eShop closes later this month.\nDeathly Delusion Destroyers looks to be a \"battle RPG,\" as the developer describes it. Holding the 3DS sideways, your characters hold out on the right-hand side while enemies flow in from the left. It reminds me a bit of that Flash classic, The Last Stand.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-TXT4-zySs\nRuby River, meanwhile, looks like a first-person survival crafting situation. You build a shelter, start a fire, cook steak, and generally try to stay alive as horrors strike.\nHeading back to Silver Falls\nSungrand Studios is no stranger to releasing games on platforms that will soon cease to exist. Both Silver Falls - White Inside Its Umbra and Silver Falls Undertakers released on the Wii U for NA last month, and the Wii U is also due to close its online shop soon.\nHeck, Sungrand has another Silver Falls game on the 3DS already, though our reviewer wasn't so keen on Silver Falls: 3 Down Stars. I respect the effort to try and be one of the last games on a soon-to-close digital platform, though. If you're still aching for more games to fill the 3DS slots up, the new Silver Falls bundle goes live later this week on March 9.\nThe post Silver Falls gets one more 3DS launch ahead of eShop closure appeared first on Destructoid.",

The standard edition will run $39.99 on all platforms. Deluxe, meanwhile, will net you some side quest packs and additional outfits for $10 more, while the premium rolls in a digital artbook and soundtrack for $54.99.\nIn a press release, Frogwares confirms Sherlock Holmes The Awakened is \"content complete\" and playable from start to finish.

Much like fellow Ukranian developers GSC Game World, the invasion and ongoing fighting has greatly affected the project, and the update from a few weeks ago showed just how the power outages and other factors have affected development of Sherlock Holmes The Awakened.\nThe Awakened is a remake of Frogwares' own 2007 Sherlock game. In the time since, Forgwares has made plenty more Sherlock, and also released the Lovecraft-sans-Holmes mystery The Sinking City. I'm betting that fans of this series are probably curious about how the studio approaches this older work now, with many more years of making Sherlock games under its belt.\nSherlock Holmes The Awakened arrives on April 11 for PC, Switch, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.\nThe post Sherlock Holmes The Awakened locks in an April release date appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Looking down the barrel of a gun, son of a gun...\nFans of Epic Games' Fortnite are currently picking apart new rumors that an all-new first-person mode is in the works for the battle royale juggernaut, with established leakers suggesting that the new perspective on Fortnite's cartoonish chaos will be arriving in the game's next season.\nFortnite has been a third-person battler ever since its initial launch in 2017, back when perhaps none of us had any idea of what a staggering global success Epic Games' venture was set to become. While some weapons in the game world already come equipped with first-person \"iron sights\", this supposed new mode would see players explore the game world directly through the eyes of their avatar — from first drop to failure.\nhttps://twitter.com/HYPEX/status/1631821256688300033?s=20\nSeveral credible Fortnite leakers have lent weight to the rumor, including @HYPEX, @GMatrixGames, @ShiinaBR, and @iFireMonkey. The new mode would certainly bring a whole new perspective, (literally), to the massively multiplayer scrapper, and perhaps the ever-encroaching storm will seem even more concerning when you're looking at the dang thing with your own two eyes... or Robocop's, or Ryu's, or Bruce Campbell's, or Jinx's, or whichever of the baffling choice of pop-culture figures you have purchased for your own trip into Fortnite's litany of islands.\nWhile there is currently no launch date for the third season of Fortnite, the current season is scheduled to end this week, on Wednesday, March 8 to be precise, so we can probably expect official word on Chapter 4 Season 3 and its contents very soon.\nFortnite is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and mobile platforms.\nThe post Rumor: First-person mode coming to Fortnite in new season appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Recon Mission\nThis weekend saw the unearthing of a rumor that Valve may be gearing up to release a new edition of its popular tactical shooter Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO), and perhaps even release this supposed surprise title as soon as the coming weeks/months.\nThe news comes from veteran CS:GO leaker and esports journalist Richard Lewis, who noticed that the latest updates for NVIDIA graphics cards feature item entries for \"CSGOS2\" and \"Counter-Strike 2\". The items, which were initially dug up by community member @aquaismissing, suggest that a potential new title is prepped to make an appearance in the very near future. Leading many to assume that a sequel to the 2012 release is locked, loaded, and preparing to open fire in the very near future.\nhttps://twitter.com/aquaismissing/status/1631087468366659584?s=20\nHowever, @aquaismissing poses a far simpler and more believable theory: that Valve is simply preparing to release an updated, Source 2 edition of the now 11-year-old shooter, complete with better connectivity, modern servers, a tauter engine, and perhaps even improved visuals and textures. As such, it seems more likely that it is an updated version of the original game that is being prepared for release — similar to Ubisoft updating Rainbow Six Siege for Gen 9 platforms — rather than a straight, ground-up sequel to the popular competitive shooter\nWe'll be sure to keep you updated once the official word is forthcoming from Valve.\nThe post Is there a new Counter-Strike: Global Offensive incoming? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Rock the Dragon\nThere was a pretty big surprise for all Senzu Bean lovers this weekend, as Bandai Namco dropped a reveal for a brand new title in the dormant fighting game series Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi. The new title did not receive an official title, release date, or platform reveal, but we did get a brief teaser.\nThe short, one-minute teaser features footage from some classic Budokai Tenkaichi titles being played on a CRT television, before the image blows up into fullscreen HD with protagonist Goku going Super Duper Super Saiyan, (or something). This clip is then followed by the brief message \"Get Ready for Battle... A New Sparking Begins\". Dragon Ball Sparking! is, of course, the series Japanese moniker.\nhttps://twitter.com/db_eventpj_jp/status/1632519982478405633?s=20\nOriginally developed by Spike Chunsoft and launched on the PS2 platform back in 2005, Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi was the first modernized fighting game set within the legendary anime universe, and saw a roster of familiar heroes and villains going at it on a unique 3D plane, replicating the hyper-dynamic look of the show. The game would receive two sequels and several spin-offs, the latest release being 2012's Dragon Ball Z: For Kinect. The series would essentially be superseded by the fantastic Arc System Works fighter Dragon Ball FighterZ, though die-hard fans have clamored for its return.\nThe new Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi is currently in development at Bandai Namco.\nThe post New Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi announced appeared first on Destructoid.",

Like its predecessor, the simplistic shmup features dogfighting action between a battalion of biplanes. The player is armed with a machine gun for sky-to-sky action, and bombs to take out battleships and other enemies lurking on land. Curiously for the genre, the horizon scrolls from left-to-right, rather than right-to-left, which is unique, but feels extremely weird given the (literal) direction the genre would take. The Deluxe edition also features alternate colors, weather effects, and new enemies.\nYou can check out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Were1974.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nyEeHx4i4s&ab_channel=Were1974\nUnfortunately for Sky Kid Deluxe, it launched at a time of a genre renaissance, with the arrival of a plethora of great, groundbreaking shmups such as R-Type, Gradius, 1942, Parodius, and many others. As such, Sky Kid Deluxe looked, (and played), pretty much archaic in comparison and would only perform modestly in Japan. Namco would choose not to port the sequel overseas, and it would not receive an official release in the west until its inclusion in the Namco Museum Virtual Arcade release in 2008.\nSky Kid Deluxe is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8. The original Sky Kid is also available as part of the Arcade Archives range.\nThe post Cutesy shmup Sky Kid Deluxe takes flight on Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

The 256 GB Meta Quest 2 and the newer Meta Quest Pro VR headsets are both seeing price cuts.\nIn a blog, Meta confirms the 256 GB Meta Quest 2 is dropping from $499.99 to $429.99. That price cut won't be spiralling down to the lower-capacity 128 GB Meta Quest 2, which still sits at $399.99.\nThe Meta Quest Pro sees a deeper cut, dropping from $1,499.99 to $999.99. The changes will take place on March 5 for both US and Canada.\nMeta says it's goal \"has always been to create hardware that's affordable for as many people as possible to take advantage of all that VR has to offer.\" Though the 128 GB isn't dropping in price, the company says the lowered prices on both 256 GB and Quest Pro will make them more available.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv4GWoCB4Zo\nThe price of virtual reality\nMeta Quest 2 headsets saw a price hike last year, when the company bumped the price of both the 128 GB and 256 GB models up by $100. When the Quest 2 launched in 2020, its wireless format, internal hardware, and price point all made for a very solid entry point into virtual reality.\nThat changed with the price shift though, and I don't think the cut back down on the 256 GB model changes that. Especially for PlayStation 5 owners, who now have a shiny new headset option that's in a similar price range.\nWhat's surprising to me here is the price cut on the Meta Quest Pro headset. A $500 price cut on a headset that debuted less than a year ago feels drastic. Granted, reviews of the headset weren't all glowing, and with a big price point like that, there may still be some hesitancy to buy into the newer of Meta's headsets.\nThe post Meta is cutting the price of its Quest Pro and 256 GB Quest 2 VR headsets appeared first on Destructoid.",

Players pick up the role of Norah Everhart, who ventures into a mysterious, uncharted island in the South Pacific in order to locate her husband Harry, who has vanished while on an expedition to uncover a life-changing new medicine.\nAs Norah explores the island, she will meet a party of strangers — friendly or otherwise — solve puzzles, negotiate traps, and piece together the mysteries of the island, its inhabitants, and the fate of her beloved. With luscious, classic comic artwork, a heartfelt narrative, and some pretty durn tricky, (borderline obtuse), puzzles, Call of the Sea is well worth a look for any puzzle adventure, and could prove to be a fine way to while away a coming weekend or two.\nOh, and be sure to check out our own CJ Andriessen's review.\nCall of the Sea will be available to download from Epic Games Store from March 9 until March 16.

Additionally, Christopher Judge is up for Performer in a Leading Role for his portrayal of Kratos, while Danielle Bisutti is nominated in the Performer in a Supporting Role category for her portrayal of the troubled witch, Freya. It seems highly unlikely that the smash-seller will not walk away without a fistful of gongs — at the very least — come the big night.\nAside from the God of War Ragnarok nomination sweep, plenty of great releases from 2022 are also hoping to take home a coveted BAFTA award. Titles such as FromSoftware's Elden Ring, Guerilla Games' Horizon Forbidden West, Team Asobo's A Plague Tale: Requiem, and Annapurna Interactive's Stray have also all received nominations, alongside smaller-sized hits including Half Mermaid's FMV mystery Immortality, Finji's Tunic, Massive Monster's Cult of the Lamb, and Poncle's compelling mobile title Vampire Survivors.\nThe BAFTA ceremony will take place on March 30.\nYou can check out the full list of categories and nominations over on the official BAFTA website.\nThe post God of War Ragnarok has a record-breaking 14 BAFTA nominations appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A look at who's taking up Ash's mantle\nThe next step in the Pokemon animated series is on its way. With the latest trailer, we're getting a look at the new series leads that are taking up the mantle.\nLiko and Roy look like our two new leads, each with a mysterious new artifact. Liko carries a strange pendant, while Roy has an oddly designed PokeBall. I imagine the series will probably highlight their search to uncover the meaning behind both of them.\nWe also have Friede and my personal new favorite character, Captain Pikachu. If you were worried that Ash's impending retirement would mean less Pikachu, that does not seem to be the case. We even get a Pikachu with a cool hat!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAav4UAT7zk\nPaldean starters Fuecoco, Sprigatito, and Quaxley all make an appearance here too; it looks like Sprigatito is Liko's Pokemon, while Roy has Fuecoco. Also spied in today's trailer: Fride on a Charizard, a Cerueledge, and an Oshawott just hanging out in the background of one shot. Rad!\nSetting off on a new journey\nFollowing after Ash's big championship win, this new series will see the longtime protagonist hang up his hat and let a new batch of eternally-young Trainers take the lead. It's a pretty big step, considering how Ash has been at the center of the Pokemon animated series for quite a long time.\nIt leaves a lot of weight on this special to deliver, but I'm keen to see how the show evolves with Liko and Roy in the lead. The new series premieres in Japan on April 14 with an hour-long special.\nMeanwhile, if you're keen for more in the world of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, there's plenty on the way this year. The Pokemon Company recently confirmed two pieces of DLC are scheduled for this year, with one arriving in the fall and the second arriving winter 2023.\nThe post Latest Pokemon animated series trailer spotlights its new leads appeared first on Destructoid.",

Yoshida, along with director Hiroshi Takai, combat director Ryota Suzuki, and localization director Michael-Christopher Koji Fox had a very interesting chat with Destructoid. You really should go read it.\nBut I'm a little more interested in something Yoshida said in an interview with Gematsu. During that interview, Gematsu's Sal Romano asked whether or not FFXVI would feature any lighter diversions from the seemingly quite heavy main storyline—something like Final Fantasy X's blitzball. Yoshida responded, \"We have some very dark themes that the story revolves around. We have countries at war—we can’t really have some bl…",

For each model type, there's a (Warrior of) Light version and a Dark version, which basically equates to white and blue-green, and black and purple-pink. All four of the shoes look great but before you get too attached, these shoes are Japan-only for now. There's no word on if they'll come to the U.S. \nCheck out the shoes in the gallery below: \n\nEach of these shoes will cost 17,050 yen, which is roughly $125, according to Techraptor. They will be released in Japan next week on March 15. \nShoes inspired by video games have risen in popularity, with Converse releasing two sets of Pokémon-inspired shoes last year. Perhaps more than any other shoe maker, though, Puma has been steadily releasing video game shoes. In 2018, it released a pair of sneakers based on Sonic the Hedgehog's iconic red shoes and then in 2020, Puma released a line of Super Mario All-Stars shoes. Puma announced some NBA 2K21 shoes in 2021 and then just two months later, the company revealed an Animal Crossing: New Horizons line of sneakers. \nWhile waiting to learn more, read Game Informer's Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker review. \n[Source: Techraptor]\nWhat do you think of these Final Fantasy XIV shoes?

However, its success is only possible through standing on the shoulders of the giants that trailblazed the genre. Of all the franchises Dead Cells drew inspiration from, perhaps no series was as influential as Castlevania. Because of this, the crossover between the two, which comes in the form of premium DLC for Dead Cells called Return to Castlevania, is a natural fit that not only resurrects Konami's dormant franchise but gives a nostalgic shot in the arm to one of the best roguelites available today.\nDiving back into Dead Cells for the first time in years, I couldn't help but effortlessly fall back into the hooks of the stellar gameplay loop.

In the footage of the new game, we see Goku powering up. And then the words, \"Get Ready For Battle\" and \"A New Sparking Begins\" appear on screen. \nCheck it out in the Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi teaser trailer for yourself below: \n／\n「ドラゴンボール Sparking！」シリーズ\n#ドラゴンボール #バトルアワー pic.twitter.com/VMMPWWeSUr\nMarch 5, 2023\nAs you can see, the game might be called, in some variation, Dragon Ball Sparking (that's what the tweet calls it if you use Twitter's built-in translate function, too). But regardless, the trailer ends with \"A New Budokai Tenkaichi\" begins, quelling any doubt that this is a new game in the series that has laid dormant for 16 years. Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3 was released in 2007.  \nThe teaser trailer doesn't indicate if this is Budokai Tenkaichi 4 or something else but it's exciting nonetheless to see that Bandai Namco hasn't forgotten about the series. It is somewhat surprising to see this announcement, though, considering Dragon Ball FighterZ exists. Budokai Tenkaichi is a fighting game series as well but to see a new one before a sequel to FighterZ, which was released in 2018, is something I imagine not many people could have predicted. \nWhile waiting to learn more about this Budokai Tenkaichi game, read Game Informer's Dragon Ball FighterZ review. \nAre you excited for a new Budokai Tenkaichi game?

Square Enix’s reason for the change is as follows:\nMatsuda became president in 2013, succeeding Yoichi Wada as part of a massive restructuring. His time at the top could be viewed as a bit of a rollercoaster. He pushed for innovation in Square’s flagship franchise, Final Fantasy, and voiced commitment to remaking and re-releasing popular titles from Square’s back catalog, such as Final Fantasy VII. The MMO Final Fantasy XIV also became a global phenomenon under his watch, though the company as a whole has largely struggled to land a massive success outside of the franchise. In recent years, high-profile Square Enix-published titles such as Marvel’s Avengers and Babylon’s Fall had disappoitning releases, with the former ceasing development this year and the latter shutting down this week. \nPerhaps most infamously, Matsuda was also at the front of Square’s tumultuous relationships with its North American third-party publishers, namely Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal, whose titles such as the Tomb Raider reboot trilogy, Deus Ex, and Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy were often deemed commercial disappointments. That came to a head last May, when Square Enix sold off these studios and their IPs to Embracer Group.\nIn recent times, Matsuda was also a vocal advocate for NFTs and blockchain gaming. In January, he published a letter detailing upcoming company initiatives, including making games that incorporate blockchain technology.",

Saved from the brink thanks to an infusion of Metroid DNA, the X parasite's only natural predator, she soon discovers that the parasite has spread to the research station orbiting SR388. Weakened and out of options, Samus must do whatever it takes to destroy the X threat before it's too late.\" \nNintendo says Metroid Fusion contains \"a multitude of secrets\" for players to experience that links Super Metroid to Metroid Dread. \nSpeaking of Metroid Dread, read Game Informer's review of it to find out why it was one of our favorite games of 2021, and then read Game Informer's Metroid Prime Remastered review.

You can use your high-pressure hose to blast dirt and grime off of popular locations in Midgar, and the best part is that the experience is totally free.\nThe Midgar Special Pack is available now for all versions of Powerwash Simulator. It adds five new levels, including Tifa’s Seventh Heaven bar and the Mako Energy Exhibit. Additionally, you’ll be cleaning up vehicles and mechs such as Cloud’s Hardy-Daytona motorcycle, Shinra Hauler, the Scorpion Sentinal, and the Airbuster. The pack also adds new dirt types, such as bio-residue. \n\n\nThis DLC was created in collaboration with Square Enix, with Final Fantasy VII Remake director Tetsuya Nomura writing in a press release, \n“When I heard about the proposal for a collab, I was quite busy with various other collabs and reviews, but I was especially excited about this one. I had just been playing PowerWash Simulator and was daydreaming about cleaning things from my titles. My immediate response was, 'let’s wash the entire Shinra building.' Unfortunately, that seemed to be a bit difficult, but the final line-up is exciting, nonetheless. This is something I have been looking forward to a lot, and hope everyone has a great time!”\nThis pack follows a Tomb Raider-themed expansion that launched in January. This is a pretty neat trend, and see other video game properties added to the game that are in need of good clean-up. \nPowerwash Simulator is available now for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC.",

For Asmussen, Cal's story has always been a trilogy in his head. \n\"We were already talking about the second game,\" said Asmussen. \"I mean, frankly, we were talking beyond. And these are conversations that, when we're breaking this story with Lucasfilm, it's like: 'Well, where are we going with the second game?' I always wanted to see this as a trilogy. How can we take Cal and the crew to new places beyond what we were doing in the first game.\" \nAsmussen continues, stating that Respawn had a good idea of where Survivor, which is due out April 28, takes place in terms of the Star Wars timeline. The team also knew what the stakes were going to be, what the tone was going to be, what Cal was going to be up against, and how his crew was going to be factored into all of that. On top of that, Respawn thinks about the ideas \"that we could do beyond that as well.\" \nStar Wars Jedi: Survivor was originally due out March 17, but was delayed to April 28.

The hardware is adorned with artistic elements (including obligatory crowns) and personal inspirational messages by LeBron. There’s no word yet on the prices, but you can only pre-order these items through direct.playstation.com. sometime this year. You can read LeBron's thoughts on the project by visiting the PlayStation Blog. \nOther big names involved with PlayStation PlayMakers include country music star Jimmie Allen, actor and comedian King Bach, and other professional athletes such as BMX’s Nigel Sylvester, WNBA All-Rookie NaLyssa Smith, NFL stars Ja’Marr Chase and CeeDee Lamb, French football freestyler Lisa Zimouche, and Belgian football star Romelu Lukaku.

          "description": "Telltale Games has announced that The Wolf Among Us 2 has been delayed and will now arrive in 2024. In a statement to IGN, the team explains it wants to avoid crunching the team and releasing an unfinished product as it moves development into Unreal Engine 5.\nTelltale released a brief message on Twitter announcing the delay, but CEO Jamie Ottilie shares more context with IGN. Ottilie discusses the challenges of relaunching the studio in 2019, which were then compounded when the COVID-19 pandemic began the following year. That includes announcing the game when the studio was still staffing up to help secure early funding. Despite those early hurdles, Ottilie states that development has been going well since then, but the team recently decided it wants to adopt Unreal 5 to take advantage of the engine’s new features. Unfortunately, that meant having to redo a lot of the work that had been created in Unreal 4.\nWith such a big change, Ottilie explains that the only way The Wolf Among Us 2 could still arrive this year would be either to launch it in a less-polished state (which the team wants to avoid given its high expectations) or to overwork the staff. Given that the old Telltale was infamous for crunch and burnout, Ottilie is adamant about avoiding the same practice with this iteration of the studio. \n\"I've done [crunch], and I don't want to do it again, and it's not fair to ask it,\" Ottilie tells IGN. \"You can't plan a business around it.

We don't want to burn out our good people.”\nThe Wolf Among Us 2 was announced at the 2019 Game Awards and will be an episodic title like its predecessor.

Blizzard is going to great lengths to ensure these regions are not only fun for players to explore, but feature more narrative cohesion and a stronger sense of place. \nDiablo veterans have explored regions of Sanctuary before, but this time they’re more than one-note areas highlighting a single climate or element, such as snow or desert.

It’s easily the farthest a mainline Final Fantasy game has ever been from its traditional turn-based roots, with FFXVI being easily the most action-heavy yet. That’s not surprising, though, considering the game’s combat director is Ryota Suzuki, a former Capcom developer with nearly 20 years of experience designing the action in games like Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Devil May Cry 4, and most recently, Devil May Cry 5. \nWith such a personal connection to Devil May Cry, I couldn’t resist asking: Who would win in a one-on-one fight: FFXVI protagonist Clive or Devil May Cry 5 lead Dante? Suzuki had to answer this question with two of his bosses right beside him – FFXVI director Hiroshi Takai and producer Naoki Yoshida – so perhaps we should take this answer with a grain of salt. But I don’t know, having played both Devil May Cry 5 and two hours of FFXVI during a recent hands-on preview (read about that here), I’m inclined to believe him. \nHis answer, with a sly smile and a laugh: Clive. \nSuzuki says Clive’s Eikonic abilities, which allow him to tap into the power of Eikons like Phoenix and Titan, give him the ultimate edge. And just for fun, I asked who would win in a fight between Clive and Nero. \n“Clive.” \nThere you have it, very specific fans of both Final Fantasy and Devil May Cry 5 like me; Clive wins.",

Most of that playtime consisted of me controlling Clive as I battled alongside ally Cidolfus Telamon (always a Cid, right?) through a castle dungeon. However, toward the end of my preview, I was able to fight Garuda, one of the game’s Eikons, while controlling Ifrit, another Eikon. \nAt this point in the game, roughly five hours in according to FFXVI producer Naoki Yoshida, Clive has little control over Ifrit. A special few in the world of FFXVI are Dominants, meaning they can tap into the power of an Eikon and even transform into them. Cidolfus, for example, can become the Ramuh Eikon.

          "description": "Following the release of Forspoken earlier this year, Square Enix has announced that the game's developer, Luminous Productions, will merge into the company. \nIt's a strange announcement, given that Luminous Productions was already a studio under the Square Enix umbrella. But now, it seems that Luminous Productions as an individual entity will be no more and, thus, won't be seeing its name appear on future titles.\n\"The merger is part of the Company's efforts to bolster the competitive prowess of the Group's development studios, a goal set forth under its current medium-term business strategy,\" a press release reads. \"Square Enix has developed numerous AAA high-definition (HD) games and possesses a wealth of intellectual property (IP) and content. Luminous Productions Co., Ltd. is meanwhile equipped not only with AAA title development capabilities but also technical expertise in areas such as game engine development. Combining the two entities will further enhance the Group's ability to develop HD games.\" \nAs you can see, it's not that Luminous Productions' developers are no longer with Square Enix; it's just that the team has been merged into the wider Square Enix umbrella. As for why remains unclear. Perhaps it's the result of Forspoken's mixed reception at release, but that's speculation. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Forspoken review. \nDid you play Forspoken?

This comes in the wake of a recent report stating the three console makers plan to skip the annual event entirely this year. Sony and Microsoft have yet to confirm any formal attendance. \nIn a statement to IGN, Nintendo say E3 didn’t fit into its plans but will continue to support the event alongside its organizer, the ESA. \n\"We approach our involvement in any event on a case-by-case basis and are always considering various ways to engage with our fans. Since this year’s E3 show didn’t fit into our plans, we have made the decision to not participate. However, we have been and continue to be a strong supporter of the ESA and E3.\"\nAlthough Nintendo was the first of the three console makers to stop holding live E3 press conferences in favor of pre-recorded Direct videos, it was also the last one to have a booth on the show floor. Up until the last traditional show in 2019, Nintendo still had a large, often elaborate area filled with demos and a stage where it broadcasted its Treehouse Live stream. Xbox moved its booth out of the convention center to the Microsoft Theater next door in 2018 (though it was still part of E3); PlayStation pulled out of the event entirely in 2019 and hasn't returned. \nE3 2023 is being organized by ReedPop, the company responsible for overseeing PAX and Star Wars Celebration. It will be the first in-person show since the 2019 edition and only the second to take place since the COVID-19 pandemic started (the 2020 and 2022 shows were completely canceled, while 2021 was a virtual event). E3 runs from June 13-16 at the Los Angeles Convention Center and will have dedicated attendance days for industry and fans. The show has no exhibitor list yet, but Ubisoft recently confirmed it will attend E3 if it happens. Xbox head Phil Spencer has expressed support for E3's success but also alluded to Microsoft holding a separate event around the same time in Los Angeles. \n[Source: IGN]",
