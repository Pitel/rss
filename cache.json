          "description": "COPE.\nOne particularly bright spot in Sonic's recent history was the release of Sonic Mania. One part sequel and one part reimagining of the 2D classics, that retro revival proved to be one of the best-rated and best-selling Sonic projects in recent years. In the (frankly baffling) absence of a true follow-up to Sonic Mania, Sega has instead opted to look to that game’s inspiration for Sonic’s latest 2D release. Billed as Sonic Origins, this new collection presents all the original four Sonic games—including the rarely re-released Sonic 3 & Knuckles—in enhanced widescreen format with the new option to treat all the 2D entries as if they were all one big game. The end result is, well, exactly what you’d expect. All these classic Sonic games look better than ever with their new presentation and some light quality of life updates, but those of you who have already run through Green Hill Zone more times than you can count may be left wishing for a little more.\nClearly, the main draw of this package is the original 16-bit platformers and we’re happy to report that they each remain tremendously enjoyable in their own way. There’s good reason why so many Sonic fans remember these games so fondly (and perhaps a little longingly), and that’s because these games really got what Sonic is all about. No overwrought stories and bizarre self-insert characters here, just a blue dude with a ‘tude who fights an evil mustache man to save a bunch of animals and, eventually, the world.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Steve Jackson will remember that.\nWay back in the day, long before video games were any good, the cool new narrative mechanic was Choose Your Own Adventure books. Wildly popular back in the '70s, '80s, and '90s, the CYOA genre died off sharpish with the invention of point-and-click games, text adventures, and video games with vast, sprawling branching stories, which allowed players to have all the fun of meaningful choices without all the tedium of having to turn to page 32 only to find out that you've died, again. Well, you still died a lot. But the computer did the page-turning bit for you, at least.\nThe CYOA genre came back around full circle in 2013, with Inkle's fearless adaptation of the Sorcery! books by the founder of Games Workshop and Lionhead Studios, Steve Jackson. Inkle is a studio known for its mastery of word-wrangling; the very thought of attempting to map out the intricacies of the stories the team writes is enough to send just about any writer screaming for the sweet release of death. It was Sorcery! that catapulted Inkle into the spotlight — and now, with its four-part series ported to the Nintendo Switch, hopefully more people can see why.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "In the giant jumbled word cloud of all my qualities and traits, I'm willing to bet that \"pluviophile\" would be one of the biggest words. I adore rain. Whenever it starts, I tend to drop whatever I'm doing - work, dishes, significant other - and I'll be out frolicking in the downpour before they've hit the floor.\nBecause I love rain so much, I hold games to an almost unfair standard when it comes to the simulation of precipitation. How in the world can a videogame come close to emulating that wonderful, transcendental feeling of being outside in the middle of a thunderstorm? The answer is, it can't. Games have to rely on other things, like textures, sounds, and clever little animations to really sell the idea of being out amongst the H₂s and the Os.\nThe time has come, fellow pluviophiles. It's time to grade the very best rain that PC gaming has to offer. Below you'll find our eight worthy contenders. Each has been chosen for their spectacular rendition of one of nature's greatest phenomena. Each one shall be marked according to my patented and cutting-edge WIPERS grading system for digital rain. So drop what you're doing. It's time to frolick. No umbrella required.\nRead more",

          "description": "A Plague Tale: Requiem is a stealth game with several fantastical elements. The first fantasy is that you can consistently remember how to spell \"Requiem\". The second is 'What would it be like if you had the power of rats?'. The third is, 'What if rats had any power to have?'. As a new extended trailer shows, the answer is: you can sense blood, and use that power to avoid the guards who want to do a big murder on you and your sister.\r\n\nThe trailer is worth watching for its own sake, but also comes with news: Requiem will launch on October 18th, forwarding another fantasy called 'What if a game actually came out in 2022 and wasn't delayed until next year?'.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Beyond that, Nightdive's remastering has made Westwood's 1997 adventure game look notably uglier and you'd be better off with GOG's ScummVM version. The Enhanced Edition is out today and I've been flicking back and forth between the two versions, tutting. The Enhanced Edition still looks like a 25-year-old game, only now it looks 25 years old, blurry, and unlike itself.\nRead more",

          "description": "I still don't know whether to describe The Heroic Legend Of Eagarlnia as \"complicated\" or \"simple\". Before starting a game, it gives an impression of being a complex grand strategy that's something like a fantasy Total War with a D&D alignment system and a distinctly East Asian focus on characters and dialogue.\nIt's far simpler than that. There was a period of disappointment, even, when it seemed like there wasn't much to it at all. That's partly because it's easy to play it too passively, or get stuck in attritional stand offs, and partly because of the need for a bit too much repetition. But over time its subtler details become more apparent, and your choices start to feel more multifaceted.\nAnd yet, it remains at heart the same throughout. On your first ten turns you're doing the same actions as in your 200th, and its battles in particular are largely hands off. So maybe it's complicated, but simple to actually play? Hmm.\nRead more",

Oxenfree was good, and Oxenfree II looks to be doing those same things that made Oxenfree good. A 2D, side-on supernatural thriller with radios. Good thing remains good! In a world where sequels to beloved media seem to only get progressively worse, I'll happily take it (especially since this one is a Netflix-published project now). And although it's directly related to the first game, the characters and happenings in Oxenfree II are distinct enough that it's going to be accessible if you're new to the series. And even if you did play the first game, it's possible that Oxenfree II will be more thrilling and unsettling to you now, five years later.\nRead more",

These range from teleporting back to your spawn point by changing loadout or class while touching the other team’s No Entry gate, to Spies disguising themselves and creating an invisible shield at their feet to block incoming fire.\r\n\n \nRead more",

This would involve, as they always do, a bunch of benchmark tests: repeatable runs through a specific area or sequence that would give an accurate indication of how different settings and hardware affect performance. In most games these are either quick and easy or time-consuming and easy, but not The Cycle: Frontier. Oh no.\r\n\n\r\nSee, without a dedicated benchmarking tool, running these kinds of tests requires a certain controllable environment, where variables are known and parameters can be reset in a click. This is not the case for The Cycle: Frontier, whose environment is usually trying to fucking kill you, particularly though the unavoidable presence of other players. I’ve never sat down to record some average FPS values only to spend half my time cowering behind a tree, fearful of being shot, robbed and – worst of all – forced to start work over again.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Cue a heady mix of confusion and perturbation – surely Intel weren’t suggesting that Arc GPUs would only function when paired with an Intel CPU, and a relatively new one at that?\r\n\n\r\nNo, they weren’t, though the guide’s vague wording isn’t doing it – and worse, potential Arc users – any favours. Parts of the guide appear to conflate support for Resizable BAR with support for the Arc A-series in general, which further muddies things as Resizable BAR works on AMD Ryzen chips as well as those three Core CPU generations. I asked Intel directly for clarification and essentially, Arc GPUs won’t have such super specific CPU requirements just to run - though they’ll apparently perform better in systems that do support Resizable BAR.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It doesn't look quite as cool as a Razer Blade or as beautifully thick as an XMG Apex 15, but it's got it where it counts: inside. Right now, you can pick up a Nitro 5 laptop with an RTX 3080 graphics card, Ryzen 7 5800H processor, 1TB NVMe SSD and 1080p 360Hz screen for just £1499 at Ebuyer - a nearly £400 reduction from its original UK RRP. \nRead more",

There were some demos I was meant to play for, like, actual work, and then I ran into a puzzle wall or a bug or something so I just fired up Necrosmith again.\nNecrosmith is a 2D necromance 'em up that is also sort of a tower defence game. In the middle of the map is your evil lair, the Hall Of Bones, a sort of legally distinct Sauron's tower that gets more flying buttresses the more you upgrade it. If enemies (which can be packs of wolves or flying bugs or all manner of things) do enough damage to destroy it, you lose - so that's your defense bit. For the towers bit, you have to imagine that the towers can move on their own, and also that they're shambling undead monsters made from a jigsaw of different limbs you find, like an army of very unhygenic Mr Potato Heads.\nRead more",

          "description": "There's something so intriguing about a new survival game. You just never know what you might find, with some becoming the best thing since cubed diamonds and others getting left in a state of endless early-access jank. Partly to help you all avoid the duds and partly to satisfy my own morbid curiosity, I trawled through this Summer's Steam Next Fest demo list to test out a bunch. As you might expect, I got subjected to some chugging framerates and a bit of body horror, but also found some great multiplayer shooting in Dysterra and terrific tile-placement in Above Snakes, which might just become a new personal favourite.\nRead more",

The RTS potential for an interplanetary ground war against overwhelming swarms of giant not-insects is obvious enough. But the dual spirit of most Paul Verhoeven films is a major reason that The Extraordinary Lust Of Dizzy (working title: Starship Troopers) still holds up 25 years on.\n\r\n\r\nTerran Command understands that. Certainly it nods to the satire here and there, but mostly it focuses on the shooting and desperate defences and evacuations instead. This was the right decision. Though it's a little short on narrative flavour, unless you're really into exploring the setting, it's got enough tactical heft to make up for it.\r\n\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Infinifactory developers Zachtronics have revealed what they say is their last game, Last Call BBS. It’s a compilation of eight smaller games, some new and some reworked elements of previous games. These range from assembling Gundam-esque models to the tile-matching from Exapunks, now with an added single–player campaign. Of course, there’s two solitaire games thrown in for good measure too. Check out Zachtronics’ last hurrah in the trailer below.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Star Fox 64 and Kirby 64 were changed behind the scenes too\nNintendo has made some minor N64 system changes to coincide with the release of Pokemon Snap (the original) on the Switch Online service. Interestingly enough, they're making it tougher to datamine the exact changes with each subsequent expansion pack patch.\nThe obfuscation of the configuration files was discovered by dataminer OatmealDome, who pointed out the new alteration on Twitter. What they were able to sleuth out though is extra language options for the EU version, as well as the addition of CPU hacks for Star Fox 64 and Kirby 64. F-Zero X and Mario Golf's files were changed too, potentially in a bid to address the former's framerate problems users have been pointing out since it arrived.\nAt the very least, this changelog (while clouded in mist) shows that Nintendo is still updating the Nintendo 64 lineup, following the incredibly rocky launch. Some didn't hold out hope that they'd revisit them, but since then, they've tackled some of the bigger, rougher needs, including a game-breaking bug for Kirby 64.\nThat's the good news in terms of the Nintendo 64 project. The bad news is that the cadence is still super slow. There are tons of games to get to, even in terms of just first party releases, and in 2022, the drip feed release model doesn't quite hit the same.\nThe post Pokemon Snap is out on Switch, amid small N64 system changes appeared first on Destructoid.",

It kicks off at 12:00PM ET on June 28, and will run through July 12 at 12:00PM ET. There don't seem to be any major changes: you just need to talk to Interpreter Clarence on top of the Mothman Museum, and they'll give you the quests needed to start joining in on the activities/events for Mothman Equinox.\nIn other big news, Test your Metal just arrived recently, and we have a new launch trailer that quickly showcases what you can expect, as well as a more detailed developer breakdown. It'll get players through roughly another three months of gametime, as all eyes are on the September Pitt update after that.\nOf course, all of these patches are cumulative. They're adding new content and quality of life features/fixes to Fallout 76, and have done a fantastic job of shoring up the game since launch.

As you do. Accompanied by his feline pal Nyan and the beautiful Saya, Yuu embarked upon multiple adventures, with the franchise going on to spawn toys, manga, and anime series. It is renowned for its quirky nature, goofy comedic style, and cheesecake \"sexy\" content.\n\nCosmic Fantasy: Adventure Boy Yuu would receive a number of sequels and spin-offs, though it seems that Edia's new collection will only be focusing on the original title and its ultra-rare, 1991 TurboGrafx-CD sequel Cosmic Fantasy 2: Adventure Boy Van. The latter title was the only release in the series to see a localized launch outside of Japan, so fans of M.I.A. titles — as well as the golden age of sci-fi anime — will no doubt be hoping that this collection will find its eventual way to western shores.\nCrowdfunding on Makuake, Edia is looking to raise ¥3 million (or roughly $23,000 USD) and seems relatively confident that it will do so, given that the developer has already announced a launch date and price for the finished product. We will be sure to give you a heads up when more information is forthcoming. Cosmic Fantasy Collection is tentatively scheduled to launch in Japan December 2022 on Nintendo Switch.\nCosmic Fantasy Collection announced for Switch [Gematsu]\nThe post Cosmic Fantasy Collection currently crowdfunding on Makuake appeared first on Destructoid.",

A few of them are even \"rare!\" The main one that sticks out is a problem with the save screen, which is also referred to as a \"rare\" problem: but one that even one total person would find devastating. You can read the full list here on Nintendo's official site, or below.\nPersonally, I haven't encountered any of these issues pre-launch, so folks should hopefully be good to go with it installed. Ideally, if a day one patch is in the cards, the powers that be will swiftly fix anything other people find as well. In a game as big as Three Hopes with as many party variations and missions, someone will likely find something the team missed.\nFire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes patch version 1.0.1 (Released June 23, 2022)\nFixed a rare issue where the game sometimes freezes at the end of an event.\nFixed a rare issue where the game sometimes freezes when moving from Base Camp to the War Map.\nFixed a rare issue where, after selecting a file to save to on the save screen, the screen does not change and progress is blocked.\nFixed an issue where progressing certain battles in certain sequences causes the player to get stuck and prevents progress.\nFixed an issue where using a Partner Special at certain times causes the Partner Special to not end and prevents progress.\nFixed an issue where the switch Lock On target control does not work when controlling the game with the left or right Joy-Con held horizontally.\nFixed various other issues to improve comfort of gameplay.\nThe post Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes gets a thankfully minor day one patch appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Those darned Nopino Goblins\nIt’s about damned time. Natsume had some great games that were overlooked on the SNES, at least here in the west. It’s amazing to me that they’ve not only taken the time to port games like Wild Guns and Ninja Warriors, but they’ve gone to the effort of giving them upgrades courtesy of Tengo Project. After seeing the success with those titles (at least from a critical perspective, I don’t know how they did sales-wise), I was hopeful that they’d revisit one of my favorites: Pocky & Rocky. I was afraid that the need to license from Taito would be a barrier, however.\nThankfully, we’ve now gotten exactly that, but while Wild Guns Reloaded and Ninja Saviors: Return of the Warriors were “enhanced remasters,” Pocky & Rocky Reshrined is more of a sequel.

          "description": "A classic adventure remastered by Nightdive\nOne of Westwood's classics is enhanced and available again, this time for modern hardware. Blade Runner: Enhanced Edition is finally out today for PC and consoles.\nNightdive Studios put together this remastered version of the 1997 adventure classic. It's available digitally on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox consoles, and on the Nintendo Switch. The Enhanced Edition is also getting a Limited Run physical version, too.\nWhile Westwood may be known for its history in the real-time strategy genre, Blade Runner was its surprise adventure hit. It runs alongside the Ridley Scott film, weaving through the events of the movie. It has branching paths though, and has been well-remembered for both its style and impressive design.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDxS2jh76Kg\nRemastered dreams of electric sheep\nNightdive, the studio which has tackled other remasters like System Shock: Enhanced Edition, has put a few modern touches on Blade Runner. Since it's coming to consoles, gamepad support is an obvious one.\nThe original Westwood videos have been upscaled to 4K resolution and 60 frames per second. There is also an HD display, and a new clue interface. Plus, international fans can use the original foreign-language translations in Spanish, German, French, Italian, and Chinese subtitles.\nAs for reception? Well, it currently seems iffy. Users on Steam are voting it into the Mostly Negative tier on launch day. Rock Paper Shotgun also had some words about this Enhanced Edition compared to other options, and provided some good comparison screenshots.\nThere is another version of the original Blade Runner just for PC, on GOG. So if your impressions of the Enhanced Edition are similarly tepid, you can at least pick that one up instead.\nThe post Blade Runner: Enhanced Edition is out now for PC and consoles appeared first on Destructoid.",

The studio is partnering with Bandai Namco Entertainment to bring No Man's Sky to Switch on Oct. 7, 2022.\nThis version of Hello Games' space exploration sim will be available both physically and on the Nintendo eShop. Those picking the game up will get all updates that have been added to the game so far (and there have been a lot), plus all future updates.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OD5Sxbeh0YE\nWhile it's a bit later than originally intended for the Switch version of No Man's Sky, it's still wild to see this game make its way to the handheld hybrid console at all.\nYou can't take the sky from me\nSince it first launched, No Man's Sky has been a wild game to follow. Its initial offering seemed to fall short of the expectations many had for it.\nBut as time carried on, Hello Games has continued to update and build No Man's Sky up, to the point that it feels unrecognizable at times from that initial launch in 2016.\nEvery once in a while now, we get a new update that adds something huge like smuggling or settlements into the fold. Or, you know, the Normandy from Mass Effect.\nWe'll see how this vast, ever-expanding universe translates to the small form factor later this year. No Man's Sky hits Nintendo Switch on Oct. 7, 2022.\nThe post No Man’s Sky sets off for Nintendo Switch in October appeared first on Destructoid.",

That same account has confirmed that the distribution event will run from June 22, 2022 through June 1, 2023 at 5AM PT. So if you're putting this off for nearly a year, just remember that you need to wake up early that day.\nThe actual prize is called the \"Shiny Baneful Fox Mask,\" which is \"inspired by the Hisuian Snow animation.\" Hey, that's still kind of fresh! The third (and final) episode literally just debuted on the official Pokemon YouTube channel this week, featuring a young boy named Alec living in the Pokemon Legends timeline.\nThere's a lot of potential to deliver more innovative mystery gifts like this, and masks in Legends is a decent start. But there's so much more the team can do with the system, especially when you consider the last two years leading to a bigger rise in online gaming. Hopefully Scarlet and Violet will capitalize on some of that potential.\nThe post You can get a free Pokemon Legends mask right now via mystery gift appeared first on Destructoid.",

It seems, however, that there was a third piece of KoF news that day... Though you might not find it for looking.\nOn Tuesday, eagle-eyed fans spotted a new Twitter account advertising something plainly called \"The King of Fighters Crypto\" (or \"CryptoKOF\"). This endeavor — not developed by but allegedly \"authorized by\" SNK — appears to be a blockchain/NFT project based upon the crossover fighting series. According to the Twitter page, The King of Fighters Crypto would see \"The return of the king, to fight again in the metaverse arena.\"\nYou already know what happened next. Like so many similar announcements before it, CryptoKOF was immediately hit with insults and comments of disdain from the King of Fighters community, leading the Twitter page to go private within mere hours of its initial discovery. While this is not SNK's first dabble in the NFT market (the company already has a deal with online market OnBuff to sell NFTs based on SNK properties), it is yet another example of the gaming community turning toward the blockchain market and telling it — quite succinctly — that it is not welcome here.\nAnd the horse you rode in on, fellas.\nFor more reading on NFTs/blockchain technology and gaming, check out Jonathon Holmes' report.\nThe post The King of Fighters Crypto appears, gets insulted, vanishes appeared first on Destructoid.",

As reported by Deadline, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 has smashed past an incredible $400 million USD box office since its release in April of this year.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47r8FXYZWNU\nThe movie, already pushing to be the highest-grossing video game adaptation of all time, sees The Blue Blur (voiced by Ben Schwartz), in a race against the evil Dr. Robotnik (Jim Carrey) to recover the fabled Chaos Emeralds. Sonic is assisted on his journey by long-time pal Tails (Colleen O'Shaughnessey) and must face down the powerful and mysterious echidna, Knuckles (Idris Elba). The sequel was praised for its comical script and likable characters, but criticized for its length and relatively rote narrative.\nSonic the Hedgehog 2 is currently number eight in the Top Ten Highest Grossing Movies of 2022, with the sequel still yet to hit the financially lucrative box office markets of Hong Kong and Japan, which will likely add further coffers to the Paramount Pictures vault. Of course, the incredible success of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is a consistent reminder of how things could have been so different for the cinematic adaptation. Still, it's good to know that the \"original\" movie Sonic still eventually found his way into cinema history.\nSonic the Hedgehog 2 is available now on streaming services, with a Blu-ray and DVD release planned for August.

The only catch is that you need to try the Sunbreak demo.\nIn case you weren't aware, Capcom announced the demo roughly a week ago during their \"E3\" showcase stream, and it went live on June 14. It features a selection of missions, including an ultra hard Malzeno showdown.\nHere's the list of Monster Hunter Rise bonus items for playing the Sunbreak demo:\n60 Mega Potions\n15 Pitfall Traps\n30 Energy Drinks\n15 Mega Demondrugs\n15 Mega Armorskins\nCapcom also points out that you can get the demo directly here on Steam, or here on Switch. Seems easy enough!\nWhile veterans will likely balk at the items you'll get here, newcomers will probably want to take them up on the offer if possible. Having a ton of free items at the start saves you a lot of time, as you can get by most of the early story content through Mega Potions alone; not having to craft them is a huge plus.

Potion Permit is an adorable little life sim, and if you haven't seen it yet, you're in for a treat (you can also play the PC demo right now, by the way). The game is set in the small town of Moonbury, where an illness has spread. As the Medical Association's most skilled potion maker, the player is tasked with helping create the cure for the ailing townsfolk.\nLet's be honest, all of these games have a super cute art style, but I have to say Potion Permit has one of my favorite looks from a game like this in a long time. Plus, everything looks super polished, which is a huge plus going in. From the trailer, I can already get the sense too that we won't be in want of activities to pad out our playtimes.\nhttps://twitter.com/PQubeGames/status/1539579544805548032\nThere's a ton to do in Moonbury — aside from diagnosing patients, finding ingredients for potions, and of course healing them, players can get to know over thirty of the town's inhabitants, fight off fearsome creatures, and upgrade the town and the surrounding areas. There are some RPG elements too, but we haven't gotten a good look at what those might be just yet.\nOf everything Potion Permit has to offer, I think I'm probably most excited for all of the NPCs in the game. That's just around the number of NPCs you can give gifts to in Stardew Valley, and I don't want to play the comparison game too much here, but that always felt around just the right amount to me. Having a whole new cast of characters to befriend (and romance) in games like these is always a highlight for me, and I already have an NPC or two that I have my eyes on.\nPotion Permit will be available on PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and Steam on September 22, 2022.\nThe post Life sim Potion Permit brews up a fall release date appeared first on Destructoid.",

Please check with your local retailer for availability.\"\nThe shortages appear to be most apparent in the UK and Europe, though North American territories are likely to follow suit if Microsoft is unable to ramp up production.

XSEED and Marvelous confirm today that Rune Factory 5 is getting a PC port on July 13.\nThe latest entry in the Rune Factory series launched earlier this year as a Nintendo Switch exclusive. The Steam version looks to be a similar offering. It's $59.99 for the standard edition (though it's currently on a pre-launch 15% discount) or $69.99 for the Digital Deluxe, which includes the Rune Factory 4 marriage candidates outfit set. Any pre-order also nets two cosmetic outfits and a New Ranger Care Package of items in-game.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0Edy6Bx_G8\nFarming up a storm\nIf you're new to Rune Factory, it runs in a similar vein to Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley. The key difference is that Rune Factory puts a bit more of a focus on combat and exploring dungeons than the actual farming.\nDepending on what you're looking for, that can be a positive or negative. In our review of the Switch launch, Rune Factory 5 seemed to be playing the hits, while not necessarily winning over new hearts thanks to falling into some familiar pitfalls. Things can get repetitive and basic at times too.\nWhat a PC port might offer is a performance boost, which some might welcome. All-in-all, I was a big fan of Rune Factory 4 but stayed away from the next entry after hearing some early impressions of it. I'm hopeful the Steam version gives it enough of a boost to put it back on my radar.\nRune Factory 5 launches for PC via Steam on July 13, 2022.\nThe post Rune Factory 5 is coming to PC on July 13 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Who are you going to call?\nIndie publisher Digerati has announced that DreadOut 2, the sequel to cult streaming favorite DreadOut, will be bringing its ghostly goings-on to PlayStation and Xbox platforms in July, following on from its initial release on PC way back in 2020.\nhttps://youtu.be/EjkwgcI5hNI\nDreadOut 2, much like the 2014 original, is a scare-heavy survival horror title developed by studio Digital Happiness. A third-person action-adventure, DreadOut 2 tells the tale of hardy schoolgirl \"Linda Meillinda,\" (holy shit), who must use her psychic ghost-whispering powers to uncover and banish an army of spooky spirits that are haunting her town. Much like the popular Fatal Frame series, Linda is aided in her efforts by her camera... though the Camera Obscura here is replaced by... a smartphone.\nExplore Ms. Mellinda's hometown, speak to members of both the living and the dead, take on an array of side-quests, venture into dark, desolate, and disquieting corners, or just take a literal hammer to the bonce of the undead. Keep your proton pack, Spengler. DreadOut 2 expands upon the original game with a tighter focus on both exploration and combat, but is still jam-packed with terrifying monstrosities and more than a fistful of jump scares. While it's no Resident Evil, it will certainly fit the bill for those looking for a few ghoulish scenarios on a tired evening.\nDreadOut 2 launches July 15 on Xbox platforms, with PlayStation to follow on July 20, priced at around $20. It is available to purchase right now for PC via Steam.\nThe post Cult horror sequel DreadOut 2 coming to PlayStation and Xbox in July appeared first on Destructoid.",

You can check out the trailer for Molten Mirrors below.\n\n\nThose who venture into the Molten Mirrors DLC will face off against the Fyodor, the Soul Warden who digs holes and hordes souls, probably. In the trailer, there's plenty of footage of the bullet-hell elements added to Molten Mirrors that will surely put players' abilities at dipping and dodging to the test. \nHowever, taking on the challenges of the Soul Worden and the Molten Mirrors content isn't free. You can join in on the fresh mayhem if you own the Wonderlands with the $29.99 Season Pass or purchase the DLC on its own for $9.99.\nIf you're still on the fence about whether to check out Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, read our review to better inform your potential purchasing decision.",

Translations of the interview are courtesy of Google translate, so please forgive if they are a little rough.\nRegarding the next From Software project, 4Gamer inquired about three games that were in the pipeline when Sekiro was in development. At the time, two of the titles were unknown to the public, with one ending up being this year's smash hit Elden Ring. As for the other, we seemingly don't have to wait too long to see what it is.

          "description": "Illumination’s upcoming animated Mario movie was recently delayed to next spring. Perhaps the biggest downside to that news is the fact that we have to go even longer before hearing what Chris Pratt’s Mario voice sounds like. Today, Variety caught up with Pratt to ask about the film, with the actor describing his take on Mario as “unlike anything you’ve heard in the Mario world before.”\nFor those unaware, Pratt portrays Mario in the film and much the biggest buzz around the film has centered on his voice. Some have expressed concern about a non-Italian playing an Italian character and the voice potentially being offensive while the film’s co-producer described Pratt’s performance as “phenomenal.” \nSpeaking to Variety, Pratt discusses how experimented with the voice and worked closely with directors to find a unique take on Mario that he felt proud of, saying in part “It’s an animated voiceover narrative. It’s not a live-action movie. I’m not gonna be wearing a plumber suit running all over. I’m providing a voice for an animated character, and it is updated and unlike anything you’ve heard in the Mario world before.”\nRegardless of what Pratt sounds like, Nintendo is reportedly happy with the film, which was said to be mostly finished last November, so Illumination must be doing something right. The Mario movie is slated to premiere in U.S. theaters on April 7. In addition to Chris Pratt’s Mario, the cast includes Charlie Day (Luigi), Anya Taylor-Joy (Peach), Jack Black (Bowser), Keegan-Michael Key (Toad), and Seth Rogen (Donkey Kong).  \n[Source: Variety]",

          "description": "Despite being heavily criticized for his role in Activision Blizzard’s ongoing employee sexual abuse scandal, CEO Bobby Kotick will remain on the company’s board of directors for another year.\nThe publisher held its annual meeting of stockholders, who voted on five proposals, such as its list of ten directors, including Kotick, to serve one-year terms. The document detailing the results shows that an overwhelming 533,703,580 investors voted in Kotick’s favor against 62,597,199 who voted against him. 2,162,178 shareholders abstained from voting.\nThe result means that Kotick retains his spot until Activision’s 2023 stockholder meeting next June. The development comes after Kotick spent the last year under fire for reportedly hiding details of the company’s abuse problems from shareholders, which caused some employees and investors to call for his resignation. Kotick has responded by reducing his salary until “transformational gender goals” were met. Activision has since hired new chief diversity, equity, and inclusion officer. \nAlthough Kotick remains on Activision’s board, his future as CEO once Microsoft’s acquisition of the company is complete remains unknown. The deal isn’t expected to go through until sometime next summer, possibly around the time of the next stockholder meeting.",

A new War Table blog post names the date fans will see the Goddess of Thunder in action.\nMark Monday, June 27 on your calendar as the date to watch a War Table Deep Dive detailing Jane's powers and abilities. Jane will become available as part of the 2.5 update, which arrives just a day later on June 28. That should whet fans' appetite for the character's Norse-powered return in the upcoming Thor: Love & Thunder, which hits theaters on July 8. \nIt'll be interesting to see how Crystal Dynamics differentiates Jane's moveset from Thor's. In the comics, Jane possessed all of the abilities of Thor during her time as the Goddess of Thunder. The only notable difference was her ability to manipulate Mjolnir with greater control and creativity (especially when throwing it) than her predecessors, so that's something the studio can certainly hone in and expand upon. \nFor more on Marvel's Avengers, check out our evolving list of every playable hero in the game.",

To understand the design process behind the Biophage and the game’s copious amounts of gore, we spoke with Striking Distance’s Character Director Glauco Longhi to learn how the studio created nightmares it hopes will terrify players. \nLonghi tells us the Biophage was born out of the studio’s philosophical desire to create enemies grounded in reality while also applying their own creativity. He even cites realism as one of his personal pillars of what makes the most effective horror monster.\n“It has to feel grounded, it has to feel real,” Longhi explains.  “It doesn't have to be real, but it has to feel real, right?

It first established its headquarters in Sunnyvale, California, neighbor to a host of now-famous tech startups. The new logo, a callback to the retro design of the old location, features the company’s classic branding alongside a semi-transparent “50.” Atari is calling the limited-time celebration logo “Borregas” after the street where you could find the headquarters. According to the company, this design will join with the previously revealed “Sunnyvale” anniversary logo in gracing the many upcoming corporate announcements, game reveals, partnerships, and merchandising collaborations.\n “Design innovation was a fundamental driver and differentiator for Atari during the golden age of video games,” said Wade Rosen, CEO of Atari. “Every artist, designer, and engineer challenged themselves to reach creative excellence; it is a hallmark of Atari that persists to this day.”\nIn the midst of the logo’s reveal, it also looks like an Atari classic is getting a revival. According to Gamerbraves, a follow-up to Yar’s Revenge is in the works. The information comes straight from Howard Scott Warshaw, who worked at Atari in the ‘80s and created the title for the Atari 2600. The interview contained few concrete details on the project, just that it seems the sequel has been greenlit. Hopefully, we will hear more about the game as development continues.",

The title is described as a multiplayer, multi-team heist experience set in space with a punky comic book aesthetic. What this means practically is players can jump into five teams of three to battle each other over a prize and \"engage, evade, exploit, and steal their way to victory.\" The game's debut trailer shows off some fast-pasted action, but to see everything for yourself, you can check out the trailer below.\n\n\nThe story envisions a world in which the billionaires have finally made it to mars, destroying Earth in the process. However, the rich get nostalgic for their former planet's culture. So, they send out ships to collect plunder from the remnants of Earth's poor survivors. Not content to take this sitting down, the Hyenas are fighting back.\nThe game is still in early development, so the creators have not revealed the release date, but we do know the game is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Though it's still a ways off, you can sign up for Hyenas' alpha today, and you can learn much more about the title in IGN's Summer of Gaming interview-filled stream.",

But it’s not enough to simply have horrifying monsters and an oppressive atmosphere; developer Striking Distance believes it’s how you arrange these elements. And it does so through a process the team dubs \"horror engineering.\" \nHorror engineering defines the meticulous manner in which the team constructs its scares so they have the maximum effect on players. That ranges from designing a room with strategically placed entry points for the biophage, The Callisto Protocol’s monsters, to pop out, to obsessing over details as small as whether a light bulb should flicker two times or three.

You'll be able to play it on June 23.\nTwo different editions will be available – the Standard and, as Gearbox calls it, \"Chaotic Great Edition.\" The latter includes the game's season pass and the Dragon Lord Pack Bonus Content, which, among other things, adds cosmetic content. The fancy edition also comes with (sigh) the Butt Stallion cosmetic pack and the four Mirrors of Mystery DLCs. The editions are available for $59.99 and $79.99 USD, respectively. \nAcross all platforms, the Molten Mirrors (the third of the Mirrors of Mystery DLC) is also being released on June 23. As detailed by Gearbox: \nThe last Mirrors of Mystery DLC is expected to be released later this year for owners of the Season Pass or Chaotic Great Edition. It will add a new playable class. \"This shamanic elementalist channels spirits and summons storms to wear down foes with poison and elemental damage,\" Gearbox said in a press release.\nAccording to our reviewer, Tiny Tina's Wonderland is really good. As we said, it's \"upbeat and fun from start to finish, offering a rewarding adventure filled with goofy characters, imaginative bosses, and a great sense of ownership over your character through it all.\"",

          "description": "The new and improved PlayStation Plus is live and surprisingly great. \nOf course, it has all the titles you might expect: God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, and a bunch of other triple-A games. Whatever. But there's more to it than PlayStation's ever-growing list of really expensive games.\nI had little-to-no interest in the new PlayStation Plus when it was announced. But when Sony gave me three free months – the perks of being in the press, I guess, but also something I should disclose given the glowing nature of this piece – I took the time to scroll through the games list. \nTo my delight, it's full of weirdo games you probably haven't heard of and definitely have not played. Immediately, I downloaded nearly a dozen games based solely on the criteria of \"Does this look weird and/or interesting?\" It's been a blast. \nI finally played through the Gravity Rush series, and while I think Gravity Rush 2 is disappointing, the original is fantastic. I highly recommend checking it out. It takes about seven hours to mainline and consistently keeps mission design interesting. It's also a ton of fun throwing yourself around its dizzying open world. \nI also played Mitsurugi Kamui hikae. It's an objectively bad game but I can't help but love it. You play as a girl with a big sword, going after your friend who is also a girl with a big sword – but she's evil. You load into bland combat arenas that look ripped straight out of a PlayStation 2 game and fight enemies that all look the same. Again, it's bad. But charmingly, in a way I appreciate. I played for an hour and loved every second.\nNext up are Disaster Report 4, Tokyo Jungle, and the Siren series. I can't wait. But I want to know, what hidden gems have you found on PlayStation Plus? Keep it weird, unique, and interesting. If you're finally checking out Red Dead Redemption II, keep it to yourself. We all know that's a great game. Drop down to the comments and let me know what weirdo games I should play next!",

In this exclusive Game Informer interview, Ben Walker, design director at Striking Distance Studios, breaks down how combat, dodging, and the bounty of gameplay systems work.\n\n\nJoin Alex Stadnik and Marcus Stewart as they grill Ben on all things Callisto gameplay. The trio kicks off the conversation by dissecting the basics of combat. In Callisto, players balance melee and ranged encounters to keep protagonist Jacob alive as he fights through Saturn's dead moon. At your side is your trusty shiv, a shock baton, and a wide swath of weapons to fend off the Biophage and figure out what's happening on the moon.\nWhile that may seem like a pretty standard setup, the key is how players balance their approach to enemy encounters. Callisto is not a game that will overpower players. Jacob has limited ammo and health and can't go in guns blazing if he hopes to survive. Those who delve into the fray will also have to utilize the new dodging system Striking Distance emphasizes as a massive part of combat. Instead of a simple button press, you'll have to use the left stick to dodge either left or right at the precise moment. Blocking works too, but it will always cost you a bit of health. Callisto has a lot going on moment to moment, but Striking Distance hopes this dance leads to a thrilling moment-to-moment experience.\nIf that's not enough, we also discuss how the team utilizes the PlayStation 5 controller to up the immersion, upgrade trees, and much more.\nIf you want to learn more about The Callisto Protocol, be sure to head over to our exclusive cover hub below, where you'll find our preview impressions, the GI cover reveal, and more looks at the game in the upcoming days.

          "description": "Remakes of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4 were planned at some point until publisher Activision pulled the plug. This news comes from Tony Hawk himself, who discussed the series with streamer andyTHPS. \nAccording to Hawk, the \"plan\" was to develop remakes for THPS 3 and 4 following the release of the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 remake. That plan, however, got complicated after Activision merged THPS1 and 2 developer Vicarious Visions into Blizzard. \n\"The truth of it is that they were trying to find someone to do [Tony Hawk's Pro Skater] 3 and 4, but they just didn't really trust anyone the way they did Vicarious, so they took other pitches from other studios,\" Hawk says in the clip. \"Like, 'What would you do with a THPS title?' And they didn't like anything they heard, and then that was it.\"\nYou can watch the full clip below: \nTony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 remasters were in the works but they were scrapped after Vicarious Visions was merged into Blizzard. 😔\nhttps://t.co/84rlYDgvUQ pic.twitter.com/oWR70xTOYv\nJune 20, 2022\nAt the very least, it doesn't sound like THPS3 and 4 was actively in development. As Hawk says in the clip, it was planned, but he never indicates it was in production. More curious is Activision's interest in taking the series in new directions. Historically, that's been a bad idea.  \nThe news is particularly painful because, after a drought of skateboarding games, the excellent Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 seemed to indicate the king of action sports was back. As we said in our review,  \"the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater franchise may once again have a bright future thanks to this terrific blast from the past.\" Alas, history proves otherwise. \nBut actually, skateboarding games have had a renaissance in recent years. Of course, there's Vicarious Visions' Tony Hawk's Pro Skater reboot. There's also OlliOlli World, Skate City, Session, and Skater XL.",

In a new update to the battle royale game, the Sith Lord is unleashed and he won't hesitate to take you down, but if you can take him out first, you'll get his lightsaber as a reward.\nVader appears in random places each match but is easy to locate since he arrives at the island at the same time as the players. When you are in the Battle Bus, look for an Imperial Shuttle. It'll enter the airspace just above the clouds and will quickly descend to a spot on the map. The Shuttle is highlighted with a blue glow for a few seconds after settling down on the surface.\nVader is one of the toughest bosses in the game and will take some serious firepower to take out. He's also flanked by two stormtroopers. He uses the Force in a variety of ways to mess with you and can block your shots. Your best bet is to attack him from afar with a sniper rifle or approach in a group. \nHis lightsaber is a game-changer. You too can block shots with it, and it can also be thrown a decent distance to inflict big damage. Of course, you can swing it widely for melee strikes. We don't know how long Vader will be around or how he is influencing the story, but it's awesome to see him on the island dishing out punishment.

The team set out to “develop and manufacture a full form-factor mobile gaming controller to enhance Xbox Cloud Gaming with high-quality, dedicated equipment,” and who better to work with on this than the people at Xbox. Dubbed the RiotPWR Mobile Controller for iOS (Xbox Edition), this controller is available to preorder starting today. RiotPWR will release it on Aug. 1 but if you preorder today, you’ll get 10% off the price. \n\n\n“The RiotPWR Mobile Controller for iOS (Xbox Edition) is Lightning-connected, therefore requires zero batteries or Bluetooth to use, and has a removable, adjustable phone mount display,” a press release from RiotPWR reads. “It also includes RiotPWR’s unique pass-through charging feature that allows users to charge their mobile device while using the controller without worrying about a low battery interrupting their game. Users can even record their gameplay with the push of a button and plug in headphones to fully immerse themselves in their games.” \nThis controller is available to preorder today and will be released online and at various retailers on Aug. 1. \nDo you currently have a controller for your mobile device?

If a studio wants to take a new crack at an old game, especially if it’s the studio behind the original release, why not? It’s not like I have to buy the game, and who knows, it could be a new favorite for me. That’s what happened with FF7R. I love Final Fantasy 7, and I was worried the remake would not do it justice. Well, it turns out FF7R is one of my favorite games ever.

It got an excellent trailer during both The Game Awards 2020 and The Game Awards 2021, as well as a new look during the past few weeks of video game showcases. \nNow, it’s back with a new trailer that highlights more than 10 minutes of rootin’ tootin’ western action, with plenty of vampires, of course, and it looks like a great time. If you’ve kept up with Evil West, then you likely already know its combat resembles that of 2018’s God of War, with the added bonus of guns. It’s just as brutal, with even more exploding gore. This trailer showcases a lot more of that and the wide variation of biomes we’ll be visiting, too, from western frontiers to strange caverns to foggy forests and more. \nCheck it out for yourself below: \n\nAs you can see, Evil West is looking like a fun time, and I can’t wait to check it out. If you’re unfamiliar with its premise, Flying Wild Hog describes it as “a third-person action game that puts you in the boots of a vampire hunter rescuing a Wild West devoured by darkness.” Flying Wild Hog will release Evil West on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on Sept. 20. \nFor more, watch its debut trailer and then check out this gameplay showing from last December. After that, check out this vampire-infested release date trailer for Evil West. \nAre you excited to check out Evil West this September? Let us know in the comments below!",

Over the next few weeks, we’ll be covering the history and lore of Capcom’s premiere action franchise. This week we go all the way to hell with Dante as we unpack the mysterious low-point in the series, Devil May Cry 2.\nReleasing a short 15 months after the release of Devil May Cry, Dante returns with a 2-disc adventure that’s more often than not seen as the worst game in the series, and there are very good reasons as to why it turned out that way. In this episode of Video Gameography, we talk about the tumultuous development cycle that didn’t include the team behind DMC, Team Little Devils. From an unknown first director to arcade-focused developers making their first console game and a late transition of direction, Devil May Cry 2 has all of the trappings of a project that would have been canceled. That is, if not for the man who would shepherd the series for years to come. \nJoin hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), along with Game Informer Editor-In-Chief Andrew Reiner (@Andrew_Reiner) \nIf you’d like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

Murph Nerfington (I gave them the last name) will represent the company as part of a multi-year marketing push in social media, public events, and more.\nMurph looks like a Koosh mascot more than a Nerf representative, although that would still be under the Hasbro umbrella. However, if you look closely, you can see Murph is made entirely out of foam Nerf darts. The new character was created in association with a new summer initiative for the company to invite families to get out and play. Also, given the language of they/them pronouns in the mascot's announcement, Murph doesn’t have a set gender. So happy Pride month, Murph! The company even has a new mnemonic that Murph embodies, “Unleash the play in you.” I’m not sure what hard-to-remember topic this mnemonic is supposed to remind us of, but it’s a cute enough slogan nonetheless.\nBelow are a handful of promotional images of Murph handing some new Nerf weapons and looking like a late 2000s physics tech demo. \n\nIn a press release shared with Game Informer, here’s what Adam Kleinman, senior vice president and general manager of Nerf, has to say to welcome Murph into existence: \n“The launch of Murph is a testament to the success of Hasbro’s Brand Blueprint strategy and turning Nerf into the social, active play brand it is seen as today. We are thrilled to introduce Murph to fans, a mascot that represents the playful spirit that lives inside us all and is unleashed through Nerf.”\nIf you see Murph around this summer, make sure to give them a nice cold spray from your Nerf Super Soaker. You'd be doing them a favor; it has to be hotter than hell in that suit.\nWhere on the mascot family tree do you think Murph belongs? Is it on the branch with Gritty, or maybe with AM/PM's Toomgis? How about with the McDonald's Fry Kids? Let us know in the comments!",

A follow-up story would, presumably, center on Jon’s new life with the Wildlings. \nAnother Game of Thrones spin-off, the prequel show House of the Dragon, is set to premiere on HBO Max on August 21. That series focuses on House Targaryen 200 years before the original show. It's far from the only TV show in the pipeline based on George R.R. Martin's best-selling series. Other adjacent projects, such as 10,000 Ships, The Golden Empire, 9 Voyages, and Dunk and Egg, are in various stages of development. \n[Source: The Hollywood Reporter]",

Instead, we had the third annual Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest and a handful of connected and not-so-connected streams and events from other gaming media outlets and publishers. While we had a full weekend of games on display and more than enough to cover, there's something about the current setup for the game industry's biggest info dump of the year that's leaving me frustrated and unsatisfied. I find myself missing the tight encapsulation of excitement E3 used to provide.\nWhat I'd like to see return next year is the attempt to cram all of the big summer industry news into one week or a timeframe close to it. All the better if these events could coalesce in one general location. We used to have a good seven days or so of events, press conferences…",

The first original IP developed by the prolific studio in over 25 years, Starfield is expected to redefine science fiction RPGs with unparalleled ambition, boasting considerable customization options and scale. I’m as intrigued by this game as any avid space opera fan. Still, this “unparalleled ambition” worries me. \nSunday’s gameplay footage ended with what Bethesda likely thought was a big bang (pun intended). Players can land anywhere on any planet in any solar system of their choice or, as Howard excitedly put it, “Over 100 systems. Over 1,000 planets. All open for you to explore.” On cue, the camera zoomed out, revealing countless nodes on an overwhelmingly extensiv…",

Dragon's Dogma 2 is officially in the works and is set to land in 2023.\n\n\nThe announcement came as part of a video presentation commemorating the decade that's passed since Dragon's Dogma first arrived on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Hideaki Itsuno, the game's director, and key dev team members, Daigo Ikeno and Kenichi Suzuki, announced the game by unzipping their hoodies triumphantly at the end of the presentation, revealing the name \"Dragon's Dogma II,\" which was followed by a short animation of the official logo treatment to close out the video.\nBefore the big announcement, Itsuno introduced a look back at the development of Dragon's Dogma. It's a fascinating look at the director and his inspirations in fighting games like Street Fighter and melding that kind of flexible combat system with an expansive RPG story and gameplay. He also goes into the creation of the pawn system and wanting to make a single-player RPG that felt like playing with your friends online. The presentation is worth a watch for this mini-documentary alone.\nThere's no date for Dragon's Dogma 2, or any footage of the game yet, but having it in development is a huge step forward for the series after all this time. Capcom has confirmed the game is being built using the company's RE Engine, which powers games like Resident Evil Village, Monster Hunter Rise, and the upcoming Street Fighter 6.\nWhat do you want to see from the newly-announced Dragon's Dogma sequel?
