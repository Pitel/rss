          "description": "NieR-ly perfect.\nNieR:Automata is perhaps a story of the power of word of mouth. A sequel in an IP with a devoted but modest following by Square Enix standards, it became a notable sales success over time as initial fans convinced neutrals that something special had arrived. Director Yoko Taro was also clever in his approach to storytelling - playing its predecessor(s) or the recently released remaster, NieR Replicant, gives you extra context and lore, but this entry is also self-contained and gives players all of the information they need. What we have, then, is a wonderful slice of sci-fi storytelling wrapped in an accomplished action adventure RPG. It's quite unlike anything else, and now we get to enjoy it on Switch with the content- complete The End of YoRHa Edition.\nA topic that often comes up in gaming, particularly in the retail / triple-A space, is the challenge of blending creative vision with slick, attractive experiences. Publisher Square Enix made a savvy decision, as it partnered the incredibly creative Taro-san with PlatinumGames, the latter being fans of the original NieR and very much on board to apply a flair for action and combat gaming. The blend is intoxicating, and also helped to establish the reputation of Platinum's Takahisa Taura, who worked on design here before making his directing debut with Astral Chain; it's fascinating playing Automata now, as there are whispers of ideas here that are played out more fully in 2019's Switch exclusive.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

One of these happens to be the texture of the deku stick, a key item in both games that can be used to give enemies a good whack while also acting as a pretty handy makeshift torch. Apparently, the slight difference in the stick's appearance between both games wasn't by design, but rather a bug that was left during development.

Soaring into the sky via an updraft while that twinkling piano takes over the score - it is one of the game's most magical moments.

As the final game to carry the FIFA licence before EA parts ways with its partner of 30 years, most multiformat sites have been discussing FIFA 23’s importance as the finale of a long-running series, at least in terms of branding.\nFor Switch owners, however, this is old news. People can harp on about the end of an era all they like, but as far as Nintendo players are concerned the FIFA series died half a decade ago. What we’ve been getting since then is the video game equivalent of ‘80s comedy Weekend at Bernie’s, with EA propping up the corpse of FIFA 18 on a stick and jiggling it around in the hope that people will believe it’s still a living, breathing entity.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "A couple of weeks back you may remember that I played the early access build of Gloomwood, a very good Thief-like that currently snaps shut just as you reach the best bit. The Richard Gere holding a necklace of video games. One thing that I do not dwell on in my feature, though, is that I was hamstrung not just by the early access limitations of the game. For almost all of the first playthrough I did, I thought that you could neither heal nor store items in Gloomwood. I was like \"Wow, this is a really hardcore stealth sim.\"\nYou can, of course, do both of those things in Gloomwood. It's just, I am an idiot.\nRead more",

Then a gameplay reveal arrived later at Summer Geoff Fest and it immediately slid into the \"Cor, this game looks a bit good doesn't it?\" category of my brain. Finally, another game befitting A44, the studio behind minimalistic Ashen which Brendy quite enjoyed.\nColour me excited when I had the chance to see a half-hour presentation of the game in action at this year's Gamescom, and chat to A44's CEO Derek Holding at the same time. It was even better than I'd expected, honestly, and I've come away with the belief that it may just be one of the best Soulslikes to arrive in quite some time.\nRead more",

          "description": "Developers working on games for Stadia have expressed surprise and frustration that Google still haven't made contact with them, almost 24 hours after the search giant announced they were shutting down their cloud gaming service yesterday afternoon. Many of the devs I spoke with have had no communication from Google at all since the announcement, with only one saying the company had been in touch. It's not just devs who have been left in the dark, though. Through a leaked internal email sent to Google’s Stadia team, even Google's own staff weren’t briefed until around the same time the public were made aware of the forthcoming shutdown.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Beatrix LeBeau has packed up her slime-wrangling gear and has crossed the Slime Sear to Rainbow Island, a new land packed with new mysteries and new slimes.\nAs a seasoned slime wrangler myself, I was excited to dive head-first into this new, colourful world. Review code didn't arrive until launch day unfortunately, but all week I've been vibrating with anticipation. After spending a handful of hours frolicking with slimes and skipping around Rainbow Island, though, that early dazzle is starting to wear off. Monomi Park’s sequel feels a little too familiar to its predecessor in its early game, and it's put a major downer on my goo-hoovering adventures.\nRead more",

          "description": "Out Of Hands is a fairly \"does what it says on the tin\" title for this, a game where you play a dude who dreams he is made entirely out of hands every night. It also operates as a decent joke, because rather than being out of hands, he, if anything, has too many. So full marks for the name. The game itself is kind of a deckbuilder but not really, and though it also describes itself as a thriller, I can't say my heart rate was raised. In fact, behind the (admittedly very cool) visual style there seems to be a pretty run-of-the-mill \"a girl I liked is no longer in my life and I'm pretty cut up about that\" story. I guess in the full game it might turn out she was murdered, or she mudered the main character, or the main character murdered her - just, some kind of murder, maybe?\nBut in the four demo levels I played recently, it seemed like a pretty normal breakup. I was really excited to give it a go, but in the preview I didn't find the contrast between a face made of squirming hands and the well trodden women-be-leavin' plot to be particularly affective or evocative. The squirming hands are cool, though.\nRead more",

That's because you're able to fuse together any monsters you 'catch', but moreso because it's a monster collectathon where you become the monster, essentially fusing yourself with bomb dogs and hermit crabs with traffic cone-homes.\nI like the way the game does away with the overdone shonen story of wanting to become the very best there ever was, and instead puts the spotlight on its cast of characters and the relationships you form with your buds. It's looking mighty promising.\nRead more",

          "description": "If you've ever wondered what the 1987 film Running Man might look like as a turn-based tactics game (see also last year's Netflix sensation Squid Game, if the Running Man reference doesn't quite do it for you), then Homicidal All-Stars probably comes pretty close. It's the debut game from Artificer, a new studio formed by a bunch of ex-CreativeForge devs who worked on the first Hard West and Phantom Doctrine, and it centres on a woman called Scarlett who finds herself competing in the deadly TV show that gives the game its name. Like Running Man, Squid Game and all those other 'deadly games' you know and love, Homicidal All-Stars is about folks who down on their luck fighting for their lives, where their only consolation prize in these dystopian bloodbaths is not getting pulped at the end of it. \nFor Scarlett, this means mowing down scumbags in classic turn-based fashion with a bunch of other friendly competitors she's teamed up with, but this is far from a straightforward XCOM-like. Between fights, you'll also be navigating its trap-filled arenas in third-person, dodging sniper turrets, disabling tripwires, and dashing over spiky/fiery/horrible pits to get to the end of each 'episode'. It's a refreshing mix based on an early preview build I've been playing recently, especially when its gameshow hook allows for its malicious host, Orion Ford, to start meddling with your success. \"He’s the person behind the worst of the twists,\" creative director and Artificer CEO Kacper Szymczak tells me. \"He’ll start filling the level with poisonous gas, he’ll turn off the lights, drop explosive barrels everywhere, to name just a few.\"\nRead more",

          "description": "It's tough making a story where you establish early on that your main character will still be alive at the end. In The Excavation Of Hob's Barrow, a point and click, small town, folk horror adventure game, the events are narrated by the main character Thomasina, writing in the future, and the game walks a slightly different line. Rather than successfully making you believe a character you know survives is in peril, all the way through The Excavation Of Hob's Barrow you are aware that Thomasina in the future is alive but, somehow, definitely not okay. And you believe you can save her anyway.\nThis looming dread, growing increasingly loom as the game goes on, is one of the most effective weapons in Hob's Barrows' arsenal of horror. Thomasina, a barrow-digger and proto-feminist trouser-wearer in a time when trousers were worn by men, is a practical and mostly cheerful woman. She approaches all the puzzles she has to solve in the robust, roll-your-sleeves up manner of an old-timey governess who doesn't care if you hate learning French verbs. The Thomasina of the future voiceover, however, sounds blank, drained and sad. It's a contrast that weighs more and more heavy as you slice into the horrible heart of Hob's Barrow, and it underscores how great it is to play the game in its fully voiced form.\nAs well as the voice acting, Hob's Barrow has an appropriately creepsome soundtrack, making fabulous use of the juddering bass tones that put all humans and related monkeys automatically on edge, and isn't a stranger to unsettling lighting. Evil in this game is a sick purple. Most of all, some praise should be especially given to the several horrible close-ups that pop up: Thomasina's eyes, wide in shock, a malevolent cat as he crawls onto your bed; round eyes over a slack, downturned mouth with little peg teeth in it. Devs Cloak And Dagger Games can coax extraordinary depth and motion from their pixel-art and then use that to repulse you.\n Read more",

Sadly, it's become increasingly clear that Moonscars does not like me very much, and maybe even hates my guts a bit - which is ironic, considering how many organs I've chucked at its feet over the last week and a bit to appease its hungry dread moon. \nRead more",

Otherwise, and especially with delays to Valve’s official dock, there’s not much out there from the usual PC hardware suppliers.\nI therefore turned to the makers and sellers of Etsy, where a kind of indie Steam Deck accessory market has emerged. Soon, I’d bought (with my own money, you’re welcome ReedPop) a selection of unique, handcrafted, sometimes questionable gadgets and appendages, and promptly packed them onto a train for independent appraisal by a newly minted Steam Deck owner.

          "description": "The RPS-beloved turn-based strategy game Solium Infernum is back from the dead. Announced earlier today on stage at EGX London 2022, Armello creators League Of Geeks will be resurrecting and reimagining the game in 2023. Originally released in 2009 by solo dev Vic Davis and his studio Cryptic Comet, Solium Infernum cast you as an Archfiend hoping to stake a claim for Satan's empty throne. With a strong emphasis on political intrigue and Machiavellian backstabbing over taking things by force, this strategy game from hell was a firm RPS favourite back in the day, spawning an eight-part diary series of the team's play-by-email multiplayer adventures. Alas, it never quite found the audience it deserved back in the early 2010s, eventually causing Davis to shut up shop completely in 2015 and pursue a career in tabletop.\nLeague Of Geeks are here to change that, though, and after speaking with studio director and co-founder Trent Kusters (both at EGX earlier today and during a hands-off presentation of their pre-alpha demo late last week), it's clear the team have taken great care in bringing Solium Infernum up to date for modern audiences. It leans into all the same kinds of mind games as Cryptic Comet's original, and its simultaneous turn structure is still very much intact – just with lusher 3D visuals, and all-new, revamped menu screens. And it looks devilishly good.\nRead more",

          "description": "Playing Wayward Strand feels like navigating a detailed clockwork mechanism. It reminds me of those cuckoo clocks where on the hour every hour a tiny door opens revealing two mechanical dolls that come together and have a 'lil smooch. That’s essentially how Wayward Strand works but on a bigger scale. Characters are set on strict routines, following predetermined paths and schedules that are often invisible to you. They welcome an interruption - a friendly natter or helpful hand - but whether you’re there or not, they’ll go about their business regardless. The world keeps on spinning and all that.\nIt’s an interesting way of capturing the passage of time, and in Wayward Strand how you choose to spend that time is pretty important in a game that makes a point of not waiting for you.\nRead more",

And, of course, it wouldn't be the GOTY season without the coming of Geoff Keighley's big-ass extreme bash: The Game Awards.\nThis year, ticket-buying members of the public will be able to purchase entry to the live event. This marks the first time the public is allowed entry to the event, having been understandably being barred from attending since the onset of COVID-19. For the 2022 event, however, we mere peasants will be allowed to rub shoulders with the game industry's great and good, (there are some, honestly), to enjoy a few hours of live performances, trophy handouts, and trailer, after trailer, after trailer — no doubt rounded out with a 20-second video from Hideo Kojima.\nSo, if you fancy heading to Los Angeles for this year's event to see Elden Ring win everything, then keep your eyes glued to both Geoff Keighley's Twitter, and the Microsoft Theater website.

          "description": "\"Get your first look at Dead Space gameplay\"\nA Dead Space remake trailer is coming on Tuesday October 4 at 11AM ET, and it'll be our first actual look at what the re-release has in store for us.\nThe news comes by way of the game's official Twitter account, which simply notes the date and time, as well as a brief text teaser. Here's all the info we have at the moment, as well as a reiterated release date confirmation:\n\"Get your first look at Dead Space gameplay and prepare to uncover the mystery aboard the USG Ishimura when the game launches on January 27, 2023.\"\n\nAs you may recall, we got an \"early look\" at the Dead Space remake roughly a year ago, but this one promises the \"first official look at gameplay.\" This will likely include some nuanced nods to the \"Dead Space 2 inspired zero-G movement,\" as well as the updated dismemberment system.\nSince more and more publishers have gotten into the remaster/remake game, the space is decidedly crowded, but the reaction to Dead Space 2023 has been mostly positive so far. They even confirmed a lack of microtransactions a year ago! Smart move. It also helps that this particular game was widely liked at launch, and is from 2008: which feels like legitimate remake territory.\nRemaking a popular series like this also lends itself to continued side projects of re-releases; in this case, leading into Dead Space 2 and Dead Space 3. If they can improve some things with the third entry the second time around (ha, video games in 2022 in a nutshell), they could have a big winner with re-selling this trilogy.\nThe Dead Space remake trailer (live on October 4 at 11AM ET):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTDJNZ9cK1w\nThe post An actual Dead Space remake gameplay trailer is coming tomorrow appeared first on Destructoid.",

In addition to hosting over 750km of racetrack from no less than 22 countries, the new sequel will include 49 teams from the official WRC 2022 season, as well as 37 legendary cars and 165 timed special stages.

I have no info on this.\"\nThat's the kind of mystery I live for, so I got to researching, and eventually found out that a theater company called Solid Star (Heaven Eleven, Yu x You) is putting on a River City Girls play based on the original game. It's set to be performed live from December 7th to 11th, 2022. That's quite the limited run! And the cast is massive, maybe larger than that of the original game. Is that even possible? Bannon tells me that neither he nor River City Girls 2 writer Adam Tierney have anything to do with this production, so like Willie Scott once sang, \"Anything Goes.\"\nI'd love to see Bannon and Adam go to Japan to review this official(?) River City Girls play, but I'm not sure who'll pay to make that happen. Maybe Solid Star will? Even better would be if they shelled out some extra dough to cast my old Road Rules Northern Trail friend Bob Sapp as Abobo. Bob also hit me up just last Friday, for the first time in 25 years, to see how I was doing. Having Bannon and Bob come at me on the same day feels like more than a coincidence.\nSolid Star, if you're reading this, I will personally pay for Bob's airfare and lodging if that's what it takes to see him hit the stage in your show.

The November update will add a \"Dash\" function to our dungeon-running heroes, and will also offer a \"high-speed\" option to the game's many, many, many demonic encounters.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiHU6riu1UQ\nIn regards to Soul Hackers 2's U.I. and menu system, several small tweaks have been made to expedite the process and get you back to soul 'ackin in double quick time. Players will now teleport to the shop interior when selecting the shop from the in-game map, while the tip transitions on loading screens have been stripped down to increase load times. Some menu elements will also be rearranged to prevent you over-eager button mashers from accidentally clicking the wrong option.\nIn addition to the above changes, four more demons will be added to the big book of baddies. These are the fiery Aitvaras, the priestess Isis, comical warrior Neko Shotgun, and finally, the iconic cutie-pie, Pixie (Devil Summoner variant).

Amid the sprinkling of gameplay (more so than the trailer) we've gotten so far, the latest set of clips includes gameplay of a series star. New Fire Emblem Engage Marth footage is out thanks to the series' Twitter account, and gives us a better look at the hero in action.\nHere is the full introduction/mini character bio from the inaugural tweet (translated/cleaned up), which also reveals his Japanese voice actor:\n\"Marth (CV: Hikaru Midorikawa) is commonly known as 'The Beginning Heraldry', and is a noble and charismatic hero among heroes. He is the prince of the Altea Kingdom, located in the alien continent of Archanea,\"\n\nWe get to see how guest characters seem to appear in Engage, and Marth is reconfirmed as a sword user in this entry. There will also be some story elements involved with the summoned heroes, including the below conversation with the main character.\nIf Engage pulls this off, and manages to bring in some of the most celebrated characters in this series' lengthy history, it could lead to some explosive moments. Ideally the team actually manages to make these portions sing: and elevates them over a fanservice-like inclusion.\nFire Emblem Engage Marth footage:\nhttps://twitter.com/FireEmblemJP/status/1575757841809408000\nThe post Nintendo shows off Marth in Fire Emblem Engage appeared first on Destructoid.",

Since then the powers that be attempted to resurrect the series in multiplayer form, but it also died off in its own way. But with Crystal Dynamics bought and paid for and part of the Embracer Group now, it's likely time to start tapping into nostalgia.\nAs a reminder, here are the five major Legacy of Kain games that the survey centers on:\nBlood Omen: Legacy of Kain (1996)\nLegacy of Kain: Soul Reaver (1999)\nSoul Reaver 2 (2001)\nBlood Omen 2 (2002)\nLegacy of Kain: Defiance (2003)\nQuestion topics for the Legacy of Kain survey include:\nHave you ever seen someone stream a Legacy of Kain game?\nHow would you rate each game you've played in the series?\nWhat are your favorite parts about the series (mechanically and thematically)?\nWho is your favorite protagonist (Kain or Raziel)?\nWhat would your reaction to a new \"vampire game\" be?\nDo you want to see a sequel, remake, reboot, or remaster?\nDo you want a theoretical game to be single or multiplayer (co-op is also an option)?\nBeyond that, one of the most important questions drills down whether or not you'd rather see a remaster/remake of any of the five core games first. For what it's worth, my top pick is probably a Soul Reaver remake. There are so many different directions you can go, but if I had to choose one possible outcome, that would likely yield one of the best-received/commercially successful single titles.\n[Thanks Jeff!]\nThe post New Legacy of Kain survey hints at possible sequel, remake, reboot, or remaster appeared first on Destructoid.",

This incredible feat is the latest hurdle MissMikka has surmounted in her endeavor to battle their way through the FromSoft RPG with all manner of control-based disadvantages. (Previously, MissMikkaa had won plaudits for completing Elden Ring while playing with just one hand).\nhttps://twitter.com/MissMikkaa/status/1576608756187549701?s=20&t=56BFRDUEJbyE1QwIRuBRDQ\nOf course, this was hardly a spontaneous, lazy afternoon affair, with MissMikkaa racking up a total of 553 attempts, which totals somewhere in the region of 15 hours of playtime, all spent just battling this one single boss character. Like so many of these unbelievable self-set streamer challenges, it has taken dedication, patience, practice, and knees that won't fall off at a moment's notice, (like mine), in order for MissMikkaa to step up to the plate. Literally. When you add into the mix that they were also hosting a stream and speaking to the viewers while the battle raged on — That's some multitasking.\nKudos to The Lands Between Dance Mat Champion...

Right on!\nAs some folks are pointing out: the cheeky team at Nintendo managed to put in a few clear references via Salmon Run items. The first includes Doc Brown's futuristic metal sunglasses from Back to the Future 2, titled the \"Lo-Vis Visor.\" Next up we have Marty McFly's future hat (also from Back to the Future 2), called the \"Bream-Brim Cap.\" Another spotted reference includes the \"Brain Strainer\" in-game item, which is likely a reference to Ghostbuster's 2 Keymaster Helmet.\nFunnily enough, Back to the Future 2 takes place in the glorious year of 2015: when everything was supposed to be future-ized. While the full Splatoon timeline isn't clear, it does play around with the idea of the fate of the future.\nBack to the Future Splatoon 3 items:\nhttps://twitter.com/GateauLOrange/status/1576251716949139456\n[Thanks John!]\nThe post These Splatoon 3 items are a cute Back to the Future reference appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Guerrilla Tactics\nA strange, yet unsurprising, sprang forth to the information superhighway this weekend, with several sources reporting that Sony Interactive Entertainment is in the process of creating a PS5 remaster of Guerrilla Games' epic 2017 release, Horizon Zero Dawn.\nFirst reported by MP1ST, with various industry pundits and websites supposedly corroborating the news, the remaster will be an updated and upgraded take on the anachronistic sci-fi adventure, which saw hunter and tribeswoman Aloy venture out into a lush land of dangerous machinery on a quest of reflection and self-growth. Originally launching on PS4, the smash seller would eventually make the leap to PC in 2020.\nWhile details are understandably slim — even unproven — on the supposed remaster, one can likely expect improved load times, upgraded textures, improved accessibility options, and slicker visual effects, perhaps bringing the title more in line with its utterly stunning sequel, Horizon Forbidden West. We can likely look to similar PS5 remasters, such as The Last of Us and Marvel's Spider-Man, for examples of some of the improvements SIE will be striving for in this new release.\nIn addition to the remaster, the MP1ST report also claims that Guerrilla Games is currently working on a multiplayer side-title set within the Horizon universe. The alleged project is currently in the early stages of development for PS5 and PC, and will see a conflict between the world's various tribes, with gameplay defined by some form of PvP or co-op multiplayer element. Given the success of the Horizon titles to date, it figures that SIE would be looking to capitalize on the series' growth via numerous projects.\nThe gaming industry will not rest until we are all playing the exact same four games ad infinitum.\nThe post Horizon Zero Dawn remaster reportedly in the works for PS5 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It's a waiting game\nAnyone who's been into games for more than like a day knows how long the wait can be for our favorite titles to release. Game delays are a dime a dozen these days, but for some fans, the wait is so long, you start to wonder if you'll ever get to see the Promised Land. While the development cycle can be anywhere from a year or two to six or seven years at most, there are some games out there that we've been waiting much, much longer for. One of those games is Beyond Good & Evil 2, a long-awaited sequel to Ubisoft's beloved classic. It's been so long since the game was initially teased at Ubidays 2008, in fact, that the title is considered the longest-awaited AAA game of all time.\nThe previous record-holder in this regard was Duke Nukem Forever — players had to wait over 14 years from its announcement in 1997 to its release in 2011 (or 5,156 days, to be exact). We've now been waiting 5,236 days for Beyond Good & Evil 2 as of the writing of this post, and it doesn't look like we'll be getting any updates any time soon.\nUbisoft did release a full trailer for the game at E3 back in 2017 that looked pretty good, but I guess it would have been a pretty bad omen if it didn't considering they had supposedly been working on it for nine years at that point.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsoIUHDrPcg\nSome Reddit users have pointed out that we wait so long for some games that they become something of an urban legend. Beyond Good & Evil 2 certainly fits the bill there, along with Half-Life 3 and whatever project Ken Levine is supposedly working on.\nPart of me wants to respect whatever difficulties are likely going on behind the scenes to draw development out this much, but another part of me is so beyond curious to hear about any development drama. Oh well, if it's anything interesting, Jason Schreier will probably write a book about it eventually.\nThe post Beyond Good & Evil 2 is now the most delayed AAA game of all time appeared first on Destructoid.",

Sega is allowing studio Double Jump Games to license the Sangokushi Taisen IP for its new blockchain project, utilizing the company's \"Oasys\" technology. Details are sketchy at this juncture as to what form the blockchain element will take, but characters and artwork from the series are likely to be part of the collectible process.\nAs you have likely read about, here and else, the blockchain and NFT market, allows for the creation of artwork, icons, items, and other tokens to be stored in an online capacity, with ownership rights to be bought, traded, and sold. While the past year has seen all manner of franchises and companies swiftly declare their love for the new tech, the market itself has proven incredibly unstable, leading to huge losses in revenue, stolen \"ownership\" of items, and artists' work stolen and \"resold\" in NFT format.\nIn addition, video game companies trying to implement blockchain/NFT technology into their titles have often backpedaled in the face of criticism and derision from their respective communities.

Now, we're getting more details on the allegation that Nintendo's dismissal of the worker was over a labor inquiry.\nThe labor complaint was filed earlier this year against Nintendo and contracting company Aston Carter. It alleges the companies violated the legally protected right to discuss unionization without fear of retaliation.\nIn an interview with Axios, the worker is coming forward as Mackenzie Clifton. The tester alleges they were fired in February, over a question about unions during a Q&A portion of a meeting.\nIn this company meeting for Nintendo testers, during a Q&A with Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser, Clifton says they ask…",

The game’s official Twitter account announced that we’ll see this footage tomorrow at 8 a.m. Pacific/11 a.m. Eastern on the game’s YouTube channel. \nTrailer tomorrow. Tune in at 8am PT for the first official look at #DeadSpace gameplay.\nhttps://t.co/n9sLvsOLJS pic.twitter.com/b9GEoOZfEf\nOctober 3, 2022\nThis premiere is being dubbed as the \"first official” look at gameplay. That distinction likely means that the footage will be of a near-complete build of the game since developer Motive Studios has spent the last year releasing several behind-the-scenes videos showcasing gameplay in more unfinished forms. This transparent approach to Dead Space’s development has given fans raw looks at how the 2008 classic is being updated. Player feedback from these videos has even allowed Motive to make subtle but important changes earlier in the pipeline. With the game only a few months away, we're curious to see how all of that work has coalesced. \nDead Space launches on January 27 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

The collection draws inspiration from Sonic's aesthetic from the 1990s, with graphics inspired by art from the time. \nThose who are interested in the collection can look forward to clothing items like a cotton sweater with Sonic's image, a zip-up polar fleece, heavyweight rugby jerseys, a French terry loopback hoodie, cotton tees, and mesh shorts. The line also includes baseball caps, canvas tote bags, a necktie, and a hand-embroidered Sonic patch for blazers and other clothing items.\nYou can see a gallery of some of the items in the collection below.\n\nAccording to Jack Carlson, founder and creative director of Rowing Blazers, which has done collaborations with FILA, Umbro, the NBA, and more, the company's creations all hold important links to his personal life.\n\"A lot of it has to do with the things I loved growing up: the sports, the brands, the culture,\" he said in a press release. \"I grew up in the '90s playing Sonic the Hedgehog on the Sega Genesis. Sonic has always been such an interesting character to me. In the original games, he was a little bit brash, a little bit punk. He was different from other cartoon and video game protagonists. He was very '90s. Of course, there have been a lot of Sonic clothing capsules created over the years. I wanted to do something elevated, really beautifully made, and kind of timeless in its aesthetic. Of course, there's a kind of irony to it because Sonic himself isn't really very preppy, but that's the fun of it.\"\nThe collection retails as low as $38 to $325, though nothing is currently listed at the higher end of that spectrum just yet. The collection is live now, having launched yesterday. If you'd like to check out the collection for yourself, you can head here.",

After that, you won't be able to access the Stadia service in any way. As for your games and hardware, Google is offering refunds \"for all Stadia hardware purchases (Stadia controllers, Founders Edition, Premiere Edition, and Play and Watch with Google TV packages) through the Stadia store,\" according to an FAQ posted by Google today. It seems like the only aspect of Stadia that won't be refunded are Stadia Pro subscriptions. However, you \"will be able to continue playing your games in Pro without further charges until the final wind down date.\" \nIf you are hoping to get a refund for your hardware, Google says \"most hardware purchases...made directly from Google\" will not require you to return your hardware. The company intends to have the majority of refunds processed by Stadia's January 18 shutdown date. \nThe Stadia Store and all its functions have been turned off so you will not be able to make any more Stadia-related purchases or in-game transactions. \nStadia shutting down isn't the most surprising news. Despite cloud gaming's continuing rise in popularity as of late thanks to the likes of Microsoft's Xbox Cloud Gaming initiative and others, Stadia never seemed to really take off. The first big sign that Stadia might not be long for this world came back in February of last year, when Google revealed it was ending its first-party game development and closing two studios. Then, this February, word got out that Google Stadia had reportedly been deprioritized by the company. Now, Stadia has just a few months left in it before it becomes a part of history. So long, Stadia. \nDid you use Stadia? What do you think of this news? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "Skull and Bones has been delayed again, this time to March of next year. \nIt was originally due out in 2018 but then delayed to 2019. It was delayed to at least March 2020 after that, but things went quiet and the game missed that window. Then, in May of last year, Ubisoft announced that Skull and Bones would release sometime between April 1, 2022, and March 31, 2023. And now, it's slipping out of its November 8 release date, which was only just announced back in July, into a new March 9, 2023 date. As for why, the team cites a need for more polish and balancing.\nKotaku's Ethan Gach says sources say the teams working on Skull and Bones are burnt out. According to Gach in his Kotaku story, the latest technical test for the game ended on September 19. One source involved with the test told Kotaku that gameplay was more refined than in previous tests but that progression needed work as it still felt too shallow. Gach writes that this is a concern shared by multiple sources close to the game's development. \nHere's what Ubisoft has to say about the delay: \nThe last the public saw of Skull and Bones in a big way was during a July showcase, which is where we saw extensive gameplay and received the now-delayed November 8 release date. I learned a lot more about the game around the same time when Skull and Bones was Game Informer's cover story. At the time, the team seemed confident in its November release date but given the history of this title, I'm not surprised it's been delayed again. \nAre you excited to play Skull and Bones next March?

But hopefully, I'll see that in another trainer's party because I'm not sure Wiglett is a sure bet for mine. \nFor more about Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, watch the latest trailer that shows off new school rivalries, gym leaders, and more, and then watch this trailer all about competitive play in the 9th generation of Pokémon.

Digital presentations, such as the annual press conferences held by first and third-party publishers, take place a couple of days before, beginning June 11. \nThe ESA also states that the show will feature separate admission days for industry professionals and the general public. E3 Business Days, designated for developers, publishers, and press/media, take place on June 13-15. Media registration opens in December. \nJune 15-16 will host E3 Gamer Days, where fans will be admitted to the show floor. There is no date for public registration at this time. Since E3 first opened its doors to fans in 2017, professionals and the public have largely intermingled for the entirety of the show, which has caused issues in terms of crowd traffic. E3 adopting the same dividing format as events such as Tokyo Game Show should alleviate that problem.   \nAs previously announced, PAX/New York Comic-Con organizer ReedPop will helm E3 2023. The company has promised to make E3 into a \"world class event to serve the global gaming industry.\" The last E3 to take place in-person at the LA Convention Center was in 2019.

Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. \nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice?

          "description": "The Apple TV show Ted Lasso has proven to be one of the most popular and well-liked series of the last few years, introducing viewers to a lovable cast of characters whose lives and storylines largely revolve around the fictional English Premier League football club, AFC Richmond. Through its first two seasons, the series has taken home numerous awards, including the Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series in 2021 and 2022, with several of its actors – including Jason Sudeikis, Brett Goldstein, and Hannah Waddingham – taking home awards for original performances. Now, Ted Lasso reaches into a new realm: video games. \nEA Sports today announced that Ted Lasso and AFC Richmond are joining the FIFA 23 roster of teams. Lasso is joined on the sidelines by Coach Beard, with the pitch being populated by some of the team's biggest stars like Jamie Tartt, Roy Kent, Dani Rojas, Sam Obisanya, and Isaac McAdoo. While the actors' likenesses are included in the product, EA Sports hasn't indicated if we'll be hearing Jamie Tartt and Roy Kent's signature crowd chants (though it seems doubtful, seeing as how Roy Kent's chant would probably bump the ESRB rating up to M for Mature).\nRegardless of that fact, you can play matches at AFC Richmond's home ground, Nelson Road, and even take control of Coach Lasso or AFC Richmond through Career Mode. AFC Richmond is also playable in Kick-Off, Online Friendlies, and Online Seasons. FIFA 23 Ultimate Team is also adding several AFC Richmond customization items, including kits, TIFOs, and the option to select Ted Lasso or Coach Beard as your FUT club's manager. All the AFC Richmond content in FUT will be obtainable through objectives and challenges.\nYou can see Ted Lasso and the AFC Richmond squad in action through the trailer below.\n\n\nFIFA 23 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4. Xbox One, PC, and Stadia on September 30.",

Given the latter game’s events and the tantalizing trailer for its second part, Rebirth, it had me thinking that it may be a good time to dust off my copy of 2008’s Crisis Core. Square Enix read my mind by announcing a remaster of Zack Fair’s PSP adventure, christening it with the subtitle “Reunion,” giving newcomers the answer to the question of “who the heck was that black-haired fella in Remake?” As for me, I thought I had a good reason to return to the game. After playing a decent chunk of Reunion at Tokyo Game Show, I’m all good. \nMy expectations were always reasonable. Reunion is a remaster, not a remake the scale of, well, Remake. That means that feature-wise, the best way to sum it up is “That PSP game? You can pl…",

          "description": "Let me fill you in on a little secret most people won't tell you: the real way to enjoy a video game show is at home, comfortably on your couch, watching the event on YouTube. \nOver the years, the game press has done a remarkable job tricking you into thinking otherwise. The shows look extravagant, energetic, and almost like we're getting glimpses into the future, which we then curate into bite-sized news stories and on-demand trailers for our faithful readers back home. \nThe reality is much more depressing.\nWhether it's E3, PAX, Gamescom, or in this case, Tokyo Game Show, going to a video game trade event means dealing with the near-lethal combination of jetlag and overwork. The brutal FOMO of being in some of the coolest cities in the world but spending all your time in convention halls. The unbelievable cacophony of thousands of people talking at once. The unbelievable smells of thousands of people all standing too close to each other. The never-ending lines of thousands of people all needing to use the toilet at the same time. This doesn't even touch on the unavoidable safety concerns of having a video game conference in the midst of an ongoing pandemic. But I digress.\nAll that said, there's some fun stuff to look at, like big, gaudy statues and giant booths that likely cost tens of thousands of dollars for games you've never heard of and likely will never play. Stuff that really makes it all worth it. \nWhile we'd love to fly each and every one of you out to Tokyo, sadly, we only had the budget to fly out two of our full-time employees. So in lieu of attending yourself, please enjoy my curated batch of pictures of what I saw on the show floor. \nWell, there you have it, folks. All the fun of TGS without actually being there. See you next year!",

Now, we know when we can play it because Saturnalia has captured an October 27 release date. \nThat's when it will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via the Epic Games Store). Developed by Italy-based studio Santa Ragione, the team behind games like Fotonica, MirrorMoon EP, and Wheels of Aurelia, Saturnalia is shaping up to be a great time. You can find out why in the New Gameplay Today segment we recorded that's all about Saturnalia, featuring more than 15 minutes of gameplay, below: \n\n\n\"[Saturnalia] is a kaleidoscopic adventure inspired in equal parts by authentic Sardinian folklore and classic Italian Giallo horror films,\" a press release reads. \"The story involves a mysterious, centuries-old ritual that occurs every year on the night of the winter solstice in the Italian village of Gravoi. Each of the game's four playable characters must utilize their unique abilities and confront their own personal revelations in order to expose the secrets haunting the town and ultimately escape their doom.\"\nHere are some additional Saturnalia highlights from Santa Ragione: \nSeek clues in a maze-like village with no markers or compass to guide your steps.\nExplore the ever-changing town of Gravoi using matches to keep the dark at bay.\nFlight and stealth are your only options, as you cannot fight the creature that hunts you.\nImmerse yourself in the stop-motion animation and vibrant expressionist art style of Saturnalia for an eerily beautiful atmosphere that is as enthralling as it is chilling.\nControl your fate through non-linear progression and a dynamic, adaptive narrative, with unique endgames dependent on player choices.\n\n\nSaturnalia hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC via the Epic Games Store on October 27. \nAre you going to check this game out?
