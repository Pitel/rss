There comes a time in each console's life when the games start to dry up and we look to the future, and the Switch is very much in the autumn of its years. Back in May, two months into its eighth year, Nintendo said a new hardware announcement is coming at some point before April next year, and with that acknowledgement comes a sense that the really good stuff will be saved to launch the next console with a bang.\nHowever, looking back at past Nintendo systems, it doesn't necessarily mean Switch will be running on fumes for the rest of the year. You would have been forgiven for thinking Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was the Switch's last hurrah, and then Super Mario Bros. Wonder turned up. You may have thought the release of Switch in 2017 meant that the might 3DS' days of quality exclusive software were numbered, but as we'll highlight below, that wasn't the case. In fact, Nintendo has good form when it comes to putting out brilliant games at the very end of a console's lifecycle and having sold over 140 million Switches, there's a high chance that there's still gold in them first-party hills, as well as all the third-party stuff we already know about.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

He was quickly discovered, but despite patient attempts to explain that it's  been several years since he was last here, and as per tradition he's now dead to us, we've so far been unable to dislodge him. Like the smiley face hidden in the above image, he's just... there.

It seems mad to think of Kanitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess this way, given that on some level, it is a tower defence game. Tower defence! The archetypal browser-based strategy experience and darling of emerging smartphones. The great-uncle once-removed of today's idle clickers. Without meaning any disrespect to those currently working in the genre, which I've had a tonne of fun with, when's the last time you were seriously excited by tower defence? As of this week, I am seriously excited by tower defence, because Path Of The Goddess has captured my imagination. It's a stately, beautiful thing. I had a go at this year's Keighleycon, and it's one of two games at the show I wanted to carry on playing once my time was up. Thank goodness it's out (on Steam and the Xbox store) in just a month or so's time.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Ten years ago, we were drowning in early access survival games about chopping trees and crafting camp fires. Rust pit monstrous players against one another, DayZ had us dashing around for beans and bleach, while The Forest creeped us the hell out in a dark jungle. There was even a week-long celebration here at RPS called survival week to get the genre out of our systems. A lot of those games have since graduated to a full 1.0 release, but one survivalist shambled on. 7 Days To Die is a solid sandbox craft 'em up with zombie hordes, and it never left the comfort of its early access log cabin surrounded by spikes and land mines. But a (tentative) release date is finally on the horizon, according to the developers. And it's quite soon.\nRead more",

The demo in question was for Monster Hunter Wilds, which they probably should rename Monster Hadron Collider in that a major selling point appears to be making the megafauna converge and murder each other. It's possible to do this in previous games, especially 2018's Monster Hunter: World, but not like this. Not like this. Alas for the Alpha Doshaguma.

For those of you only now noticing that tens of thousands of Twitch viewers have been religiously watching video game Hot Wheels, let me elucidate. Deep Dip 2 is a fan-made tower of racetracks that was published as a challenge to the racing game's community last month. It is 16 floors of unfathomably difficult ramps, tunnels, ledges, pipes, and beams. A simple mistake sees drivers plummeting to the bottom, like the sad cauldron man of Getting Over It. The first three players to finish would share a prize pool of over $32,000. Over the weekend, one player has now managed it, and another has since joined him. Third place is still up for grabs but, mate, I wouldn't recommend it.\nRead more",

Less Good News for returning players: going by the 45 minute segment I was shown at Summer Game Fest, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is more of a single-character action-RPG plus entourage, than a proper party-based affair in the vein of 2014's Dragon Age: Inquisition. You do get a party, drawn from a retinue of seven, larger-than-life, romanceable companions encompassing a range of classes, abilities and go-faster hairdos, but control of that party has been streamlined, and there's a God Of Warlike emphasis on booting Fade demons into pits.

          "description": "One of my absolute most favouritest Steam Deck cases, besides the one you get for free with the Steam Deck OLED, is the Dbrand Project Killswitch. It’s not so much a carrying vessel as a hardened second skin, providing protection without all the bag-hogging bulk of a traditional case – while throwing in handy bonuses like a clip-on kickstand and grippy thumbstick covers. For owners of the Asus ROG Ally, the recent launch of a Project Killswitch for their own handheld PC should therefore represent glad tidings with extra gladness, even if it won’t also fit the upcoming ROG Ally X.\nThank the new device’s bigger battery, wider SSD and reworked connection layout for that particular lack of forwards compatibility, as the ROG Ally X’s thicker dimensions will make it just slightly too beefy to slip into the Killswitch’s skintight silicone. A shame, but at least it makes a quality addition to the original Ally right this second. I’ve been manhandling one for a week now, and it’s just as practical and protective as the Steam Deck version.\nRead more",

          "description": "Computer Artworks' 2002 videogame adaptation of 1982 movie The Thing was a ghoulish and gripping third-person shooter with some terrific mechanics that weren't quite fleshed out, flesh being the operative word. For instance: you can enlist surviving soldiers as squadmates, but are they really surviving soldiers, or are they human-shaped warrens of teeth and mandibles poised to split open and shower you in digestive juices? You have a limited supply of blood tests with which to determine whether any people you rescue are Things in waiting - and even as you're worrying about them, they're casting suspicious eyes at you, care of some embryonic \"trust\" and \"fear\" systems.\nSadly, much of this acute paranoia could be easily gamed out in practice - back in 2002, I deduced that contact with enemies increased the odds of infection, and adopted a policy of shooting anyone who'd been in my squad for too long. But it's the kind of system an intelligent remake could pounce upon and have fun with. Sadly, Nightdive are not working on a remake, like their previous System Shock remakes. They've just announced that they're making a remaster, due later this year. Still, I will take a Thing remaster and thus, the opportunity to write more about The Thing, over no remaster at all.\n Read more",

Firstly, this game clearly contains a non-zero quantity of blades, from whacking great axes to katanas. Secondly, I do not accept the premise that these are phantom blades. They are very obviously non-spectral, going by the amount of stabbing and clanging on show in the video. With these potentially ruinous caveats out of the way, I am now free to tell you more about a game that looks like it's out to eat Sekiro's lunch.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Final Fantasy XVI ended up being one of my favorite games from last year. Clive’s journey to liberate the oppressed magic-weiding Bearers of Valisthea and cleanse the world of the spreading Blight won me over with its earnest and lovable characters, flashy and frenetic fights, serene and grandiose soundscapes, and the titanic, cinematic boss battles that are simply unforgettable.\n\n\nBut for all of its many achievements, Final Fantasy XVI felt a bit simple and underdeveloped at times. A number of design choices seem derived from the developer’s previous experience with Final Fantasy XIV, while other elements fail to meet the same complexity and variety as its MMO counterpart.\n\n\nIf the recently rebranded Creative Studio III gets an opportunity to follow up on this style of Final Fantasy game,…",

          "description": "Resident Evil developer Capcom recently announced that it will bring the seventh entry in its iconic series, Resident Evil Biohazard, to all Apple devices with an M1 chip or better. For Mac laptops, that means any Mac Book Air or Mac Book Pro from late 2020 onwards will be able to run the game.\n\n\nHowever, this isn’t the first time Capcom has released a Mac and iOS port for the Resident Evil series. The current Mac Resident Evil games are essentially a dedicated showcase of just how powerful the M-series chips and integrated graphics cards can be, especially on devices such as the Mac Book Air, which don’t have a fan. \n\n\nResident Evil Games for Mac Available Now\n\n\nMac and iPhone users can currently purchase both Resident Evil Village and the Resident Evil 4 remake via their device’s App Store. Resident Evil Village on Mac in particular is a spectacle to behold; I can personally vouch for its impressive performance on the M1 Mac Book Air. While there have been a few audio glitches here and there, the port is exceptionally well optimized. \n\n\nImage via Capcom\n\n\nThe Resident Evil 4 remake on M1 devices also has generally positive reviews on the Mac App Store, though users should note that you’ll need approximately 125 GB of free space on your drive to install the game, which is nearly double the listed size requirement in the store. \n\n\nUpcoming Resident Evil Games for Mac\n\n\nThe Resident Evil Biohazard Mac and iOS port is currently slated for July 2nd, 2024. However, Capcom has also announced on its Apple games page that it will be bringing the Resident Evil 2 remake to all M-series Apple devices as well. We don’t have a release date for this one yet, but if the previous Mac Resident Evil ports are anything to go by, it’s sure to be an exceptional experience.\n\nThe post Resident Evil on Mac: Which Games are on Apple Devices? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "We’ve become very accustomed to seeing new Paldeck videos released by Palworld every weekend, but the one released on June 15 is slightly different. Rather than showcasing a Pal we’ve come to know, they showed off a Pal that we’ve yet to meet — Chillet Ignis. \n\n\n\n\nChillet has become a huge fan favorite among players. The original Ice type Pal is a fluffy looking Dragon capable of inflicting huge damage, all while looking cute, and the Ignis variant is no different. \n\n\nChillet Ignis looks like someone took the original Chillet and turned up the color temperature, which is apt, because as a Fire type this Pal is likely to bring the heat. Apparently, Chillet Ignis is capable of spinning so fast it will emit sparks, so it might be best to give this one a wide berth until it warms up to you. Pun intended. \n\n\nThe Alpha Chillet Ignis shown in the Paldeck video is a level 52, which is an exciting reminder that more levels are coming when the Sakurajima update arrives on June 27. This is excellent news to anyone like myself, who has taken a break through a lack of levels to climb or new content to experience. \n\n\nWe’re usually given two Paldeck videos each weekend, so the next should release tomorrow. The sneak peak at the end of the Chillet Ignis video shows another much loved Pal, despite the fact that it’s not even in the game yet — Croajiro, the small frog armed with a stick. \n\n\nImage via Pocketpair\n\nThe post Palworld showcases a new Pal in latest Paldeck video ahead of Sakurajima update appeared first on Destructoid.",

In exchange for the power, the eater will lose their ability to swim. In fact, even the mere exposure to seawater greatly weakens them. In the world of piracy, that's a major weakness.\n\n\nDespite the risk, however, many characters couldn't resist the temptation of power. Thus, numerous ability holders roam the seas.

I’d somewhat followed the No Man’s Sky marketing, intrigued by the prospect of getting to live out my space-age fantasies, and I’d absolutely caught wind of the disastrous launch. That didn’t worry me as I headed off into the depths of space – I was borrowing my brother’s copy of the game, anyway. I figured I’d fly for a few hours until, like apparently everyone else had, I got bored and then returned the game. A few months later, I was 300 hours in, and my brother said I could just keep it. \n\n\nSince then, No Man Sky has pulled a wild turnaround, winning back the people who left it disen…",

Games like Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order have used the format of the Soulslike and thrown in Metroidvania-styled exploration, while also doubling down on a parry mechanic despite being released before Sekiro. \n\n\nStill, despite the popularity of Soulslikes, it has not felt like enough games have taken inspiration from Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. Many fans of From Software's games, as well as those who simply appreciate a well-made video game with fleshed-out combat mechanics, tend to refer to it as a masterpiece. \n\n\nSo, why a Sekiro-like instead of Soulslike?\n\n\nIt's important to lay out what separates Sekiro from the rest.

After years developing Baldur's Gate and its sequel early in its history, BioWare struck out to create its own fantasy RPG. That series began with Dragon Age: Origins in 2009. It was followed up with Dragon Age II in 2011, and then Dragon Age: Inquisition in 2014.

As part of that, <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2024/06/09/hoping-to-sprint-in-the-right-direction\">we learned the series is implementing a new movement system</a>, bringing back round-based Zombies and Classic Prestige, and taking us to the year 1991 for its campaign. We also learned another key piece of information: when we'll be able to play it.</p>\n\n<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 25. Alongside that, players can expect a campaign that hopes to instill a sense of paranoia and intrigue with the Black Ops team going rogue in order to remove an entity that has infiltrated the highest levels of government, as well as a competitive multiplayer suite that includes 16 all-new maps.

No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.\nThis is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.\nIf you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.\nNow, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)\n>",
