          "description": "A master thief creeps over cobbles in an early modern metropolis that splits the difference between Edinburgh, Glasgow and Liverpool. Lit by gaslamps that can’t quite dispel the industrial haze, they pass for a civilian - a rough one, admittedly, but not shady enough to cause an itch in the swordarm of any passing guard.\nUntil, that is, they take to the thieves’ highway - following the trajectory of their grappling hook upward to the rooftops, from which they can see the shape of the city, and the moon beyond. Up here, it’s a parallel world - the trees on street level answered by chimney stacks, and the distant hills echoed by the rise and fall of steep gables. “We’re super proud of these rooftops,” says Greg LoPiccolo. “It’s an amazing landscape that we put a lot of thought and effort into, and it’s a lot of fun to traverse.”\nBack in 1998, LoPiccolo was the game director who saw Thief: The Dark Project to completion. Today - after an 18 year detour to Harmonix to lead projects like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, among other adventures - he’s the game director of Thick as Thieves. “It really is an opportunity to do something unique and cool and new, on the shoulders of this stuff that is now well-respected,” he says. “Thief has some legs, right? People still talk about it to some degree.”\nRead more",

Fights are like if you took a MOBA and forced both teams to bash heads constantly. Success lies in picking off Spider-Man or Squirrel Girl or Marcus Fenix so as they wait to respawn, you hop on the big area that needs capturing. Or you push the cart while tanky Hulk absorbs bullets with his biceps and John Marvel snipes from afar.\nThe more I played Rivals, though, the more it hit me that it's specifically a messier, more complex Overwatch. A hero shooter with a surprising amount of polish and charm, sure, but also one that slides off my brain like water off Birdman's back. I understand why it's supremely popular at the moment and yet, I really don't.\nRead more",

          "description": "After a failure-riddled start, my attempt to turn S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2’s mutants into beasts of war is finally bearing fruit. I’ve engineered a Bloodsucker attack that wiped out the worst of villains – someone who was mean to me – and I’ve progressed far enough to really open up the map, and with it, access to more of the Zone’s fiercest fleshwarps.\nAlso, rats. Buoyed by the successful Bloodsucker siccing, I’m back on the trail of some mysterious anomaly scanners, and word is I might find a lead inside a local maze of wrecked cars. It’s heavily guarded by some gangster types, but for once, I won’t have to dash off in search of some far-off muties and coax them back here using my neck as bait. Mercifully, a gaggle of overgrown rodents are already hopping around right outside the labyrinth’s entrance. I beckon them in like a bouncer on his last day, then sprint past the stunned gunmen, who can barely shoulder their rifles before being set upon by a pack of giant carnivorous hamsters.\nRead more",

          "description": "In more ways than one, today’s Total War: Warhammer 3 expansion marks a milestone for game director Rich Aldridge and his team at Creative Assembly. Omens Of Destruction’s three headline legendary lords each bring new campaigns and units for their respective factions, but it’s the fourth lord - a Khorne champion free to all players - that I imagine Aldridge will end up remembering the most fondly.\nWhen Total War: Warhammer released back in 2016, it shipped with eight legendary lords - famous characters from Games Workshop’s fantasy setting that here act as faction leaders. The number grew steadily and, in terms of announcement order at least, today’s addition of Arbaal The Undefeated marks the series’ 100th. That's a hundred campaigns, a hundred joint efforts of game design, animation, art, writing and voice work.\nAldridge has never been shy about the team’s ambition for the series to eventually offer up each unit from every Fantasy Battle 6th edition army book (\"The goal is to do everything, right?\"). But ambition is one thing, and considering the fraught conditions at Creative Assembly and parent company Sega over the past few years, it’s not just the addition of the 100th lord that feels like something to celebrate. It’s taken time, effort, and a siesmic shift in update frequency, but Total War: Warhammer III is in the best place it's ever been.\nRead more",

It seems to play a bit like XCOM, with an oppressive world map that is slowly encroached upon as you travel around recruiting soldiers, interacting with settlements, and picking real-time fights with hellfiends \"inspired by biblical descriptions and European folklore\".

But the platform is testing a new option in the beta client, which lets you set download behaviour to git new gigs only when you actually launch a game.

My birthday is very close to Christmas, and so you’d think this might make me immune to the serotonin-sapping effects of the greyest season in a “I was born of the cold. Moulded by it” kind of way. No such luck, I’m afraid. So, since there’s only so many Vitamin D supplements and delightfully festive lunchtime Gin and Tonics one can consume, I figured I’d ask: what are your favourite comfort games for the bleaker months? The special places you can always rely on for an escape when the weather outside is frightful, and the Cosy Fireplace Ambience 4K (10 hours) keeps getting interrupted by adverts for crypto scammers and War Thunder.\nRead more",

          "description": "While it’s always worth starting a new game of Cyberpunk 2077 just to hear Judy say \"his own choomba shot him!\" for the thirtieth time, there’s now a slightly more tangible reason to start a new journey into Night City’s open world. Update 2.2 went live yesterday, bringing with it a host of fixes, as well as some deeper customisation options for both your character and vehicles. The base game is also 55% off on Steam until the 18th of December, with the Phantom Liberty expansion at 20% off, or both in a 48% off bundle. Cyberpunk is on sale often enough, although these current discounts line up with the cheapest it's ever been on Steam. Again: worth it for the line.\nRead more",

All those other games, with their decisive action, systemic consequence, and neck-snapping: I was playing those to relax, too. Why else would I have snapped all those necks? Being shorn of base pleasures does not make Naiad a restorative oasis amid a desert of stressful video games, and it doesn't make it more relaxing than its peers.

I think there are three reasons for this enthusiasm: 1) it's free-to-play with the usual comet's tail of microtransactables 2) it's third-person Overwatch with Marvel characters, a straightforwardly enticing licensing sandwich, and 3) people want to have sex with a larger-than-usual proportion of the cast and especially awful tongue-monster Venom, who has a good butt in this one. No, I'm not going to share pictures. You'll have to google that filth yourself.\r\n\n\r\nBut perhaps you are a sophisticated soul who has no time for such salacious nonsense. You're more interested in hearing how they're patching the thing. Enough with the butts already, dang it - this is a new multiplayer game so there must, of course, be patches!

It's like offering to shake hands while wearing one of those comedy hand buzzers - except that the hand buzzer is an intricate simulation of zero-G physics, missile behaviours and comms jamming, featuring spacecraft with proper internal layouts that require you to think hard about attitude control if you don't want, say, your engines to become Swiss cheese about 90 seconds before you need to retreat from combat. \r\n\n\r\nBeing a \"true\" 3D real-time space strategy game, Nebulous looks and sounds a lot like Homeworld on the surface, but it's nothing like as straightforward. It is systems within systems. It is a game in which you can, theoretically, plot the path of a single guided munition through an asteroid field, so as to catch an enemy cruiser in the back. I barely understand how to make a ship fire on another ship, using plain old armour-piercing shells, and now they're threatening to add carriers, fighters and bombers. Customisable ones!

          "description": "I’m quite smitten by the Nintendo DS stylings and traditional roguelike charms of Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon Of Serpentcoil Island, but I’m having real trouble summoning up the motivation to repeatedly grind through its opening levels to get to the interesting stuff. Early stages soon lose any real sense of surprise, and later ones can feel low on real agency. I want a new roguelike run to feel vital and verdant; heady with grand plans and plan-shattering twists. But by having randomness influence each run so significantly, Mystery Dungeon feels fickle instead of emergent - less than the sum of some incredibly novel and creative parts.\nRead more",

As the main antagonist in Indiana Jones And The Great Circle, Emmerich Voss vacates the archetypal armchair usually reserved for secondary fascist goons, so that he can goosestep straight into the big boy seat himself. He smiles with all the sleaze of right-hand-man Major Toht, the grubby gestapo who gets that right hand burned in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Yet he also engages in the pseudo-intellectual trash talk of the main archaeological rivals to Jones, like Rene Belloq or Walter Donovan. He is a hideous grab bag of all the things that make an instantly detestable villain in the series. But there's something else. Voss is so immediately and gutturally hateable because he resembles a type of racist encountered not in the 1930s, but one you've probably met today: the asshole you meet on the internet.\nWarning: Here be spoilers.\nRead more",

As one must when encountering horror media, the game and I immediately enter a spiritual staring contest, each of us knowing the real game here was it trying to freak me out. \"It’s fine\", I decided. \"It’s just a heart! I’ve got a heart. It’s actually very useful. Nothing to be scared of\". Thing is, Eclipsium’s menu heart is actually massive and sits, like The Eye Of Sauron, atop a giant obelisk. “Ah. That’s definitely a horror thing, that” I was forced to admit. \"If my heart was on a giant obelisk, I’d be proper shaken up, I reckon.\"\nSo starts Eclipsium’s very first bit of aggressive disorientation, and it basically just escalates from there. I obviously can’t describe the vibes without slightly spoiling the vibes, so do pop over to Steam for a demo if you’re curious and, oh, there’s a potted plant, the sound of its rustling mixed in such a way that it sort of sounds like it’s shrieking at me.

Another pleasant  discovery was Oolo itself, which you can discover yourself through the shrouded magic of this link to it’s free demo.\n(Do I need to keep writing ‘free demo’, by the way?

          "description": "The protagonists of two of my all time favourite RPGs share something in common. Both (the best Final Fantasy game) Final Fantasy 8’s Squall and The Witcher 3’s Geralt simply cannot get enough of leaving their friends and the entire world in mortal peril while they sneak in a quick round of cards, and I love them for it. Way back when the Wild Hunt released, there was a special edition kicking about that gave you a few decks for Gwent - the fleshed-out, playable card distraction that ended up being responsible for some of the game’s best moments. I pined for those decks, but I never acquired them. Now, Hatchette Board Games is putting out a full physical edition of Gwent next year.\nThe set contains \"over 400 cards and a playmat\" for £44/$39.99. I’m still recovering from various Fantasy Flight LCGs, so my value sense for this stuff might be a bit skewed, but that strikes me as incredibly reasonable. A good Gwent deck consists of only about 25 cards. They’re not bad cards, either! I’ve got a real pet hate for tabletop versions of videogames that just use in-engine screenshots for the cards, but these ones look to have the proper artwork from the game on them:\nRead more",

          "description": "Where were you during the Summer of Doronko Wanko? Why, I remember it like it was March, and not actually Summer, when the delightful free game about a mucky pomeranian was unleashed into the world. Yep, yep. It was definitely March. Roughly translating to ‘covered in mud doggy’, the game set you the task of racking up tangible financial damage to your owner’s house by getting mud everywhere - first by normal dog means, and then with giant mud cannons. You can grab it for free on Steam here.\nIt stole our hearts, it did. And talking of stealing things and having a good time doing it, it’s also releasing on the Nintendo Switch soon, which means the Steam version of Doronko Wanko is getting some free DLC to celebrate. It isn’t arriving until next Spring, but it’s bringing three new mystery dog breeds with it when it does.\nRead more",

The Hitlerites and blackshirts of Indiana Jones And The Great Circle sneeze and cough as they patrol the dig sites of Gizeh, or the marble corridors of the Vatican. Although this is the Machine Games' clever way of letting you know where your enemies are at all times, it is also mildly funny, as if all the Nazis have been secretly kissing each other, spreading the same rhinovirus from Italy to Egypt to Nepal and beyond. More than that, it's a stubborn reminder that, despite the many hours of perfectly motion-captured cinematics that accompany all this, you are still playing a video game. A snotty tissue that separates the Indy of taut two-hour cinema and the Indy of a sweeping first-person punch 'em up that will take days to complete. All this is to say, you will notice the difference. But that might not matter; they're both still Indiana Jones. \r\n\n \nRead more",

At best. I’d successfully lured some bandits into the deadly lair of a bucket-tossing Poltergeist, but several attempts at more actively siccing mutated pigs on the Zone’s human baddies had all failed, even when I’d seemed to actually tame one.\nNow, my only friend lay dead at my feet, and I’m in dire need of some new beasts to master. And some cash. It turns out that a fighting style that involves letting shopping trolley-sized swine creatures chew on my heels is bad for the ol’ HP, and having recently blown my savings on half a sausage, I’m forced to shift focus from my current debt collection mission towards a means to fill my own coffers.\nRead more",

          "description": "I think It’s safe to say that Trigger Happy Interactive’s upcoming survival horror Total Chaos is a bit of a palette change from their last offering - the frenetic, neon-drenched, chainsaw-legged Turbo Overkill. Still, it’s not often we see psychological horror combined with ultraviolence, and anything that gives off even a whiff of Condemned: Criminal Origins has my attention.\nTotal Chaos started life as a popular Doom 2 mod, and while I dare the say the limitations of that game sell the atmosphere a little better than this much sleeker update, I certainly trust Trigger Happy enough to make the most of the new engine. The game is set in New Oasis, a “once bustling haven for coal miners” that is now most definitely not bustling, nor haven-like.\nRead more",

The Intel Arc B580 graphics showed some nice generational uplift under Linux for most workloads but there were some anomalies where clearly the Intel Linux graphics driver had room to better optimize the new Xe2/Battlemage graphics support. Windows benchmarks of the Intel Arc B580 also showed it performing more competitively to the likes of the GeForce RTX 4060 compared to what I was seeing under Linux. Thus I spent the past few days working on some Windows 11 vs. Ubuntu Linux graphics benchmarks for both Intel Arc Graphics of Alchemist and Battlemage GPUs to see how the performance compares.",

Based on the social media rumors, the Winter Wildcards promo is going to be released this Friday. So far, EA Sports has remained tight-lipped about which players will feature in it.\n\n\nEA FC 25 Winter Wildcards promo player leaks\n\n\nAs of writing, only one player has been leaked, but it's safe to expect new names to appear as we get closer to the release. It will be interesting to see which footballers will be included in this promo and if it will be a two-team affair. If we get two teams, it means that the Winter Wildcards promo will last for two weeks.\n\n\n\nErling Haaland (expected to get two cards with two positions). \n\n\n\nInterestingly, there have been a couple of rumors doing the rounds as we wait for the names of the footballers to appear. A new card design called \"NumeroFUT\" has reportedly been added to the card database. The design seems completely different from anything we have received in Ultimate Team in the recent past.\n\n\nWinter Wildcards is also expected to have its version of Heroes and Icons. Last year, Winter Wildcard Icons had different positions on them, which really made the promo interesting. Whether EA Sports does something similar this year remains to be seen.\n\n\nEA FC 25 Winter Wildcards promo release date\n\n\nThe upcoming promo is expected to go live on Friday, December 20, right ahead of the Christmas season. The cards will be available at 6 p.m. UTC, which is the usual time for all promo releases. Apart from new cards in packs, promo items will be available in Objectives and SBCs, so make sure to be on the lookout for them.\n\nThe post EA FC 25 Winter Wildcards promo player leaks and release date appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Having a powerful fishing rod is important for your in-game progression in Fisch, and using Enchant Relics will help you to empower them.\n\n\nEvery rod has certain attributes that determine how well it works, and some of them also have unique passive abilities that help you with certain catches. Using an Enchantment Relic will help you boost the existing stats of the rods, and you can choose them to strengthen a specific aspect of a rod you own.\n\n\nHow to buy Enchant Relics in Fisch\n\n\nThere are two main ways to get Enchant Relics - buy it or fish it out of the water. If you opt for the latter, you won't need to spend any extra resources. However, you can't rely on this process, as the odds of getting a Relic are low. Secondly, the one you get might not be what you're looking for.\n\n\nIf you want a more foolproof procedure, you can buy Enchantment Relics from Merlin. You can find the NPC at Sunstone Island, and buying a Relic will cost 11,000C$. While this process has no reliance on luck, it can be expensive if you're just starting to play Fisch. You'll also have to reach level 30 before you can use this function inside the game.\n\n\n\n\nTo complete the Enchantment process, you'll have to stand at the platform situated at the Keeper's Altar when it is night. Make sure you have equipped the rod that you want to enchant. Once the process is complete, you'll have a random enchantment on the equipped rod.\n\n\nThis Altar can be found at The Statue of Sovereignty, which can be accessed from both the starter island and Sunstone Island. You'll need a boat to travel to the place, and a small amount of in-game credits is also needed to begin the Enchantment process.\n\n\nIf you're a beginner, you won't need to worry too much about getting the relics, as they're best suited once you have a few mid and endgame rods in your inventory. \n\nThe post Where to buy Enchant Relics in Fisch appeared first on Destructoid.",

She's taking over for Jo Wyatt, who voiced Ciri in The Witcher 3. \n\n\n\"Ciara Berkeley was cast as Ciri for The Witcher IV Cinematic Reveal Trailer,\" a representative from CD Projekt Red told TheGamer. \"Ciara is a talented actress who impressed us with her enthusiasm and vocal acting skills, and in this trailer we believe she truly brought Ciri to life in a way that is both faithful to the character and exciting for fans of the series.\"\n\n\n\n\nCiri gets recast for The Witcher 4, as some were assuming\n\n\nFans began speculating over the change following the release of The Witcher 4's cinematic trailer during The Game Awards 2024 last week. Even though it's been roughly a decade since the game, sharp-eared players pondered over Ciri's possible voice change. I also felt she sounded a bit off, but I chalked it up to the possible span of time between each game's story.\n\n\nI can get by the change, though. The cinematic trailer showcased what looked to be a more experienced Ciri, who passed the trial to become a full-fledged witcher. She seems older, more experienced, and perhaps as fed up with the superstitious common folk as Geralt. No wonder he took up the wine-making business. Berkeley gives the Lion of Cintra a harder edge to her voice, which makes sense considering the aforementioned.\n\n\nBerkeley is a fairly new actor, beginning in 2020 with three productions to her name. She's appeared in Swing Bout (2024), The Deceived (2020), and Normal People (2020). The Witcher 4 will be her first video game role.  \n\nThe post Your ears weren’t lying: Ciri confirmed to be recast in The Witcher 4 appeared first on Destructoid.",

For the most part, you and other players will outperform them, but they're still worth having for weekly quests.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHow to hire a specialist in Fortnite Chapter 6, Season 1\n\n\nHiring specialists in Fortnite involves visiting any NPC that appears with a square dialogue icon on your map. As you land or travel to a landmark, you'll notice these appear, indicating someone is nearby to hire or purchase weapons from. \n\n\nFortnite Chapter 6, Season 1 has four specialists in the following locations:\n\n\nNPC Name\nSpecialist Type\nLocation\n\n\n\n\nCinder\nHeavy Specialist\nOpen-Air Onsen, south of Demon's Dojo\n\n\nVi\nScout Specialist\nRolling Blossom Farm, south of Seaport City\n\n\nMizuki\nSupply Specialist\nLost Lake\n\n\nHelsie\nMedic Specialist\nCanyon Crossing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach specialist costs 250 gold bars to hire, making them inexpensive if you're only hiring them once or twice for some quests. Nonetheless, if you recruit them during every round, these costs will add up, so be sure to pick up as much gold as possible from eliminations and chest loot.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHow to collect ammo in Fortnite\n\n\nFortunately, collecting ammo is much easier than hiring a specialist.

A Kickstarter to fund it will launch sometime in January.\n\n\nIf you’re not familiar, Judero is a bizarre stop-motion game maybe about Scotland, but also not entirely? You play as a dude trying to climb the glass mountain because the game world compels him to do so. It’s hard to describe. I don’t fully get it myself, but the vibes are immaculate. I’ve got a full review of it over here if you’re interested.\n\n\n\n\nInformation on Mashina is pretty sparse. It seems to be named after how people commonly mispronounce “Machina” (it’s mahk-ee-na rather than mash-ee-na), and it seems to star a rotund little robot. The teaser trailer provides us with shockingly little information. The Kickstarter and YouTube description simply say, “A little robot digs to repair her world. Dig, build, discover and mend in a chill, stop-motion world.” That’s all the information in its entirety.\n\n\nI’m sure more details will be given out when the Kickstarter launches. Judero’s Kickstarter had plenty of information, and, looking back, had a lot of stuff already complete and ready to go. But I think you already have an idea of what you’d be getting from Talha and Jack Co.
