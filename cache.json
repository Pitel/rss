And at Gamescom, we found out when we can expect to play the game on all consoles — 11th February 2025.\nDebuting alongside the release date was the first-look at the gameplay, nd it looks absolutely stunning. Of course, we don't have Switch footage yet — and we're sort of staggered that they'll be able to squeeze the game onto the console — but hopefully it'll look nice on the hybrid console. Well, we'll find out early next year.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Unfortunately for James, he accidentally walked straight into Gamescom. “I’m starting to think that there are a lot of video games” he informed us yesterday. Horrifying if true. Still, it does sound like he’s managing to have some fun there, mainly by hitting up Saber Interactive COO and former id Software co-owner Tim Willits for some top tips on how to avenge Edwin’s thieving ways.\nTips about kill-stealing aside, James found time to ask Willits about Space Marine 2's microtransactions, and whether there was any nervousness returning to a cult hit series… especially one a lot of people had almost given up on ever seeing again. “Even the “push forward” combat of the original was part of [id’s] inspiration when we created Doom 2016,” answered Willits. “So for me personally, it’s this huge circle. It’s always intimidating working on a franchise that people love.” But, with the right team, technology, and vision he says, “it just comes together.”\nRead more",

          "description": "Now, I never played quite as much as our Brendy did of the original Splitgate. But I had a fun time with its mixture of Halo-esque trigger pulling and portalling around! So I was intrigued to give the alpha version of Splitgate 2 a go and see if it had a little more substance to it than its initial reveal, which gave off a, \"it's Splitgate but with more money\" feel. \nWell, I think it's… a bit serious? It certainly has more polish and some extra additions, yet I didn't come away from it thrilled by its more competitive, class-based FPS leanings. I think it just needs a bit more time, perhaps, for a portal to open and some silly rocket launchers and baseball bats and zombies to come tumbling out of it.\nRead more",

A long-limbed man riding a bicycle in a threadbare suit chases children down an alley. A gangly, bowler-hatted pursuer scuttles down a long table like a spider. It's familiar enough territory, at least at first glance. But when Tarsier have a body of work subconsciously scarred by phantasms this vivid, recurring nightmares are just as potent.\nRead more",

It also features a traffic-summoning warlock named Steve wearing a hi-vis robe. It’s finding that one absolutely, perfectly ridiculous XCOM turn, every turn…and at the same time knowing it’s absolutely, perfectly fine if you don’t.

Developed well over two decades ago, the original Silent Hill 2 is the magnum opus of Polish horror stalwarts Bloober Team. Running on then-innovative \"Unreal Engine 5\" technology created by Jazz Jackrabbit publishers Epic MegaGames, it's a wonderful abyss of a game that remains perfectly playable today, given a certain amount of tolerance for the quirks of the era.\nIt begins with your character, James Sunderland, descending from the road towards the eponymous Midwestern nowhere-town. Like many games of the period, Silent Hill 2 uses a third-person, over-the-shoulder manual camera, which allows you to glance fearfully up at the monstrous pine trees that fringe the path - each rising from a bulging tide of fog that menaces with the suggestion of approaching figures. There is moisture everywhere, gushing from drain pipes and dribbling down concrete barriers. As you amble into the murk, deathly chords and groaning, unmechanical motifs reverberate from somewhere deep underground. \r\n \nRead more",

Silent Hill 2 is the more feted of the Hills - if I were a calculating franchise custodian tasked with 'bringing back' one of the acclaimed original trilogy, that's probably the instalment I and my spreadsheets would fix upon. I mean, it's the game with Pyramid Head in it - the nearest thing Silent Hill has to a mascot, and it's not like there's an issue of cutting out plot material: each game in the Silent Hill series is, on some level, a distinct story with a distinct protagonist.\nStill, the decision to 'skip' the first game in the series, whose world, narrative themes, music and art direction set the parameters for all the rest, made my brain itch a bit, and when I ran into Bloober's creative director Mateusz Lenart and lead producer Maciej Głomb at a Konami event, I had to ask about it. \r\n \nRead more",

What separates Black Myth from the crowd, though, is its slick presentation and a sense of generosity. You're to witness the most lavish, cinematic worlds and its creatures.

If I don't love it, I don't swallow.\nAh, you needn't worry. This is by far the most fun I've had reviewing a game, and Shapez 2 has, in my mind at least, turned the holy trinity of factory games (Factorio, Satisfactory, Dyson Sphere Program) into a holy quartet. Its pared back, everything-is-free-forever approach is quite liberating, and I've never had so much fun placing conveyor belts in my life.

What a perfect time, then, to dive into the alpha demo for vampire management game Blood Bar Tycoon, especially since Two Point seem to be resting on their laurels a bit too comfortably for my liking.\nThe idea here is you build a swanky bar serving claret cosmopolitans, ichor-ish coffees and uh, viscera vampiros to your undead clientele. But (with the sorta exception of the crimson-sapped Dracaena cinnabari) blood doesn’t grow on trees, so you’ll also be moonlighting as a human-nabber. You’ll research a slew of “whacky contraptions” to extract their blood, which I greatly enjoy, because “zany exsanguination” is a real winner of a feature. You can’t frivolously phlebotomise with impunity, however - you’ll also want to be on the lookout for vampire hunters aka the fun police.\n \nRead more",

          "description": "It’s been looking grim for Super Earth recently. I mean, not really. Multiplayer shooty Helldivers 2 is still sitting around 35,000 concurrent players, which is perfectly respectable, if only around 10% of its peak back in April. Still, a clutch of disgruntled ‘divers have recently found a novel way to protest an increasingly unpopular series of nerfs: laying down their guns and letting the bots take the damn planet.\n“If Super Earth wanted to remain safe, they would stop nerfing our guns,\" reads one comment on the subreddit, in response to a post titled “Let the bots advance. Let the Super Earth burn.” It seems to have picked up some steam inside the actual game, too. As of earlier this week, there’s only around a thousand players actively trying to stop the bots advancing perilously close to the home planet, via Gamesradar.\nWhether this is all massively overblown for the sake of a dramatic yarn or not, Arrowhead themselves have taken note of player concerns over nerfs. Yesterday, game director Mikael Eriksson unveiled a plan for the next 60 days, directly addressing player feedback over the controversial ‘Escalation of Freedom’ update.\n \nRead more",

Back when I was OXM's online editor, \"free Xbox games\" was one of our golden Google pillars, the other two being \"Minecraft Xbox 360 update\" and \"Skyrim something something\". Well, uncle Valve has just rudely torpedoed that ancient investigative initiative by adding a Trending Free tab to the Steam frontpage, encompassing prologues, demos, free-to-play games and that most treasured of jewels, a full free game with no monetisation elements, such as Grimhook.\nDo not cry for us pitiful electronic scribblers, crowded on our melting internet icebergs. Play free games instead! Thanks to that new tab, I've just discovered a demo for neato wide-format tower defender Frontline Crisis.

          "description": "Aside from being a game where you run around a shopping mall murdering the living dead, the original Dead Rising from 2006 is a clownish satire of sleazy tabloid photojournalism. It expresses this by way of its scoring system, where you earn \"Prestige points\" for snapping pictures that fit one of five categories: \"Brutal\" scenes of characters being slain; moments of \"Horror\", such as the spectacle of an approaching horde; comical \"Outtakes\", like characters caught in bizarre poses; moments of \"Drama\", such as people reacting to discoveries; and \"Erotic\" photos of women alive or undead, which range from snaps of exposed underwear to close-ups of cleavage.\nThe Erotica tag has, however, been chopped from the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, in what Capcom gingerly suggest isn't \"a response to a changing cultural climate\", but expressive of the view that earning points from such photos is not \"an appropriate reward for survival and not a skill required of a journalist trying to stay alive\".\n Read more",

The Deck’s compatibility issues aren’t nearly as issue-some as they were at launch, but between its Linux-based SteamOS and its relatively mild processing power, but it is true that beefier Windows handhelds will more likely cater to your entire cross-launcher library.\nUnless, that is, you get something else to run them for you. Streaming games on the Steam Deck has emerged as a nifty workaround for the portable PC’s lingering compatibility woes, making even officially unsupported games playable. Usually with much better performance, too, as the actual rendering work is done remotely – what you see on the Deck’s screen is basically a video feed of that remote device’s display output, with your control input beamed the other way via a low-latency connection. And because you’re not using SteamOS or the internal hardware to actually run the game, it’s not bound by their limits.\nRead more",

Doing this requires you to stand upright in full view, with your back turned upon an entire space station's worth of shiny domed technology and guttural industrial noises. Delightful!\nAmongst the players harrowed and compelled by this fixture is Fede Álvarez, director of the 2013 Evil Dead remake, 2016's Don't Breathe and, most recently Alien: Romulus - the seventh and avowedly \"back to basics\" Alien movie. Isolation is the Alien experience that convinced Álvarez the Alien could still be scary, after decades of milking the creature's dugs for spin-off movies and making it share a screen with the Predator, the Pepsi Max to Alien's Dom Pérignon 1921. In possibly self-defeating homage to Creative Assembly's work, he's filled the movie with Emergency Telephones, turning them into a straightforward-sounding form of foreshadowing.\n Read more",

I’m tempted to look up how it works but I don’t want to find out it’s made from the luminous, genetically-engineered husks of the workers that drop dead from dehydration at the fulfilment centers or something. To help distract me with yet more books, it’s Dishonored: Death Of The Outsider writer and Destiny 2 senior narrative designer, Dr. Hazel Monforton! Cheers Hazel!

A merry old time was had, romping through fortress cities like a small herd of crusader buffalo, using the game's absurd jetpack functionality to pancake invading Tyranids, and getting our screens so slathered in gore we couldn't work out who was killing what.\nIt looks like the gargantuan action game's PvP multiplayer will be even messier. Saber and Focus Home have released an extended trailer that walks you through two major modes - the PvE boss and wave-slaying frenzy of Operations, and the 12-player PvP carnage of Eternal War, which spans a range of match types. The ecstasy of dying for the Emperor aside, both give me frightful flashbacks to the early days of Gears Of War.\n Read more",

          "description": "Playground Games has announced a brand new game mode in Forza Horizon 5. Titled Hide and Seek, this mode will pit five \"Seekers\" against one \"Hider\", who will do their utmost to escape the pursuit.\n\n\nThe trailer marked the beginning of Xbox's Gamescom 2024 livestream. Coming September 10, Hide and Seek will be available as a free update for all. While the core gameplay will be based very much on the childhood activity we all participated in, there will be a few adaptations.\n\n\nYou'll have to make strategic calls in Forza Horizon 5's Hide and Seek mode\n\n\nIn Hide and Seek, you can't just outrun your Seekers if you become a Hider. A special meter will be available at the bottom of your screen, and as the gauge fills up, you can camouflage yourself. As a result, you can even hide in the open and make a fool out of those pursuing you.\n\n\n\n\nBut beware: drive too close, and the hiders can ping your location. This will help them track you down before approaching the Endzone. From what I understood, the Endzone will be visible as a bright-orange location, but it will take time to activate. While hiding might be the right choice in certain situations, be ready to run when required.\n\n\nForza Horizon 5, released in 2021, continues to get more content in festivals and seasons. I am more than intrigued to try out Hide and Seek when it goes live on September 10, 2024. The mode will also have its own reward track, which will include XP from the games you play. Playing continuously will also help you to unlock a play streak and get bonus XP as well. \n\nThe post Forza Horizon 5 will let you play Hide and Seek with cars this September appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Windup Games, a studio founded mainly by industry veterans and former staff from Coldwood Interactive (Unravel, Unravel Two), has revealed its debut game, Hela. It’s an open-world adventure involving mice; it’s coming to PC and consoles, and it’s the best thing I’ve seen this morning.\n\n\nThe trailer shows off two mice trying to figure out some sort of puzzle involving a hanging pair of eyeglasses while not waking a cat. They hold their breath as a rolling washer makes potentially cat-rousing levels of noise. When the cat doesn’t stir, balls of light waft in through the window. They get focused into one ball by the glasses, and then the mice stuff it into a jar. Take that, magic.\n\n\n\n\nThen, it cuts to the good stuff: the gameplay. The mice swing around like Spider-man in a big yard using woolen tongues that shoot out from their frog-shaped backpacks. They then glide around by filling their backpacks with hot air or something. There’s foraging for mushrooms, giant bunnies, and some good-old cooperative gameplay.\n\n\nIt looks a bit rough in a low-budget Unreal Engine 5 kind of way, but the gameplay looks bewilderingly enjoyable. The press release describes it as “heartwarming,” but I think it looks rad. If you get to ride a paper boat down a stream, I’m going to lose my mind.\n\n\nHela doesn’t have a stated release date and is said to be coming to PC and consoles.\n\nThe post Hela, a new game from Unravel creators, features mice with frog backpacks appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "With any online video game, there are bound to be some errors and bugs, especially after a major update. Disney Dreamlight Valley is no exception, and the emergence of a new issue, Initialization Error 6, is causing some players to miss out on exploring newly added quests and characters. Here's how to fix this error.\n\n\nInitialization Error 6 fix in Disney Dreamlight Valley\n\n\nWhile Initialization Error 6 is hitting at a seemingly random time for some players, one potential culprit is the Reflection of China House Style. Using this as your house can cause this error to occur with no way to reverse it. In other cases, it may have hit at a completely random time without any apparent causes.\n\n\n\n\nFortunately, Gameloft, the team behind Disney Dreamlight Valley, is aware of this bug and is working on a fix for it. While there's no current solution at this moment, we can anticipate one arriving either on August 21, 2024, or shortly after. If Initialization Error 6 appears again after this date, Gameloft will likely reinvestigate the problem and release another hotfix.\n\n\nIn the meantime, you can try the following tips to resolve or work past the issue:\n\n\n\nRestart your game.\n\n\nRedownload Disney Dreamlight Valley.\n\n\nPlay Disney Dreamlight Valley on another platform.\n\n\nRemoving the Reflection of China House Style temporarily if you manage to get in-game again.\n\n\n\nWhile these aren't guaranteed to fix the error, they may help temporarily remove it until Gameloft implements a permanent patch. There's no exact timeline for when a hotfix will be released, but the team has listed it as a top-priority bug, so we can expect a patch pretty soon.\n\nThe post How to fix Initialization Error 6 in Disney Dreamlight Valley appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, unlike other resources that you can grow, bamboo has a specific spawn location and growing condition.\n\n\nBamboo location in Disney Dreamlight Valley\n\n\nYou can find bamboo anywhere in the Wild Tangle as part of Disney Dreamlight Valley's Rift in Time expansion. Rather than planting and growing seeds, you can forage them like you would any herb in the base game. It'll randomly and periodically sprout out of the ground, allowing you to quickly harvest it each day without spending money on seeds.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHowever, this also means you can't just grow and harvest dozens of bamboo at a time. You'll typically find between 5-10 at one time around the Wild Tangle, meaning you'll need to revisit the location multiple times throughout the day if you need several.\n\n\nHow to use bamboo in Disney Dreamlight Valley\n\n\nYou'll mainly use bamboo for quests, cooking recipes, and furniture crafting. While you won't need it for any base game missions, A Rift in Time's story quest line asks for it occasionally, particularly in its third act.\n\n\nAlongside this, you'll need it for the following cooking recipes:\n\n\n\nPiquant Piranha Soup: Bamboo, Chili Pepper, Piranha\n\n\nBraised Bamboo Shoots: Bamboo, Canola, Ginger, Soya\n\n\n\nLastly, you can create bamboo items at your crafting workbench. You can make items like bamboo shoots, benches, and walls, among other options, to turn your house into a beach resort if you'd like. I haven't tried doing this yet, but it could be a fun little project for the future.\n\nThe post How to get bamboo in Disney Dreamlight Valley appeared first on Destructoid.",

Not only can you try out some interesting foods, but you can skip creating the meals yourself by buying some from her. Let's check out how to unlock Tiana's restaurant and Meal Stall.\n\n\nHow to build Tiana's Palace in Disney Dreamlight Valley\n\n\nPrincess Tiana's restaurant, also known as Tiana's Palace, is a building you'll create after reaching level two friendship with her. You'll initially unlock Princess Tiana after finding her Cajun cookbook and making Enchanted Shrimp Etouffee, with the palace arriving shortly after. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nOnce you raise Tiana to friendship level two, you'll begin the Back From the Bayou quest, with the first objective asking you to build her palace. Unlike her house, you won't have to pay a fee to Scrooge McDuck; you'll just need the room to place it. \n\n\nTiana's Palace is her restaurant, where she'll start testing recipes and developing the idea for her Meal Stall. That's right. You won't have to wait long for the meal stall, as it comes up immediately after you build her restaurant.\n\n\nHow to build Tiana's Meal Stall in Disney Dreamlight Valley\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter building her restaurant, you'll unlock the requirements to build Tiana's Meal Stall. After entering the restaurant and talking to her, you'll see a new objective to build the meal stall, requiring the following materials:\n\n\n\nGlass (15)\n\n\nBrick (5)\n\n\nHardwood (10)\n\n\nSoftwood (25)\n\n\n\nOnce you collect each resource, you'll find Tiana's Meal Stall under Functional Items in your crafting workbench. Place the Meal Stall anywhere near her palace to unlock both locations.\n\nThe post How to unlock Tiana’s restaurant and Meal Stall in Disney Dreamlight Valley appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Resolute Counterflow is an extremely helpful and core mechanic in Black Myth: Wukong, but the description given in-game makes it a little confusing to understand. It took me a moment of trial and error to pick up the move, so allow me to save you a little time and explain how it works, so you can perform it as needed.\n\n\nHow to use Resolute Counterflow in Black Myth: Wukong\n\n\nFirst, Resolute Counterflow's entire purpose is to give you an out during your attack string. Enemies get really aggressive later on in Black Myth: Wukong, and sometimes simply dodging the incoming attack is not enough. \n\n\nTo use Resolute Counterflow, you first need to gather enough Focus Points, as the move requires you to have at least one. When you have one, to perform the move, you first need to begin your Light Attack string. In the middle of it, pressing Heavy Attack will allow you to perform Resolute Counterflow, which looks like a downward strike. The move interrupts everything you were doing prior, effectively making it a cancel move; a benefit in a pinch.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nMore importantly, the 'counter' part of Resolute Counterflow comes from perfectly timing the activation of the move with an attack that would otherwise hit and deal damage to you. This results in a significantly more powerful attack that will deal more damage and inflict more poise damage on the enemy. You'll know if you did it right when your character is glowing red during the attack animation.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nA successful Resolute Counterflow counter prevents you from taking damage from the attack you countered and any attacks that would normally land during the animation. This move is especially useful during boss fights, as many of Black Myth: Wukong's bosses have long attack strings, making it difficult to get hits in without it.\n\nThe post What is Resolute Counterflow in Black Myth: Wukong? appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's the same schedule as the one followed during the last maintenance in June. All forms of online matchmaking, including Ultimate Team, will be disabled 30 minutes before the scheduled start.\n\n\nToday's maintenance will also affect EA FC 24 servers across all platforms.\n\n\n\n\nWhen does the EA FC 24 maintenance (August 21) end?\n\n\nAs per the announced schedule, today's maintenance will be an affair of six hours. Unless there's any delay, it will end at 2 p.m. UTC/7 a.m. PST/10 a.m. EST. There's always a chance for the maintenance to be extended without prior notice from the developers.\n\n\nWhich game modes will be affected?\n\n\nUltimate Team, for starters, will be completely unavailable. Any attempts at matchmaking will result in an error. The same applies to other online modes like FC Clubs. You could play games in offline modes like Career. In Career, you can lead your selected club to glory as a player or a manager.\n\n\nThat said, fans hope there won't be any delay and that matchmaking will return as per the official schedule.\n\nThe post EA FC 24 maintenance (August 21): When will the servers come back online? appeared first on Destructoid.",

There are already some wonderful creations themed around them, and some involve future rookies. That said, importing them into a Franchise mode can be tricky if you haven't done it in previous Madden titles.\n\n\nHow to download future draft classes in Madden NFL 25\n\n\nThe Download Center will be your best friend (unless you want to sit and create the entire future draft class).\n\n\n\nStart and load the game.\n\n\nFrom the main menu, go to the first option under Download Center.\n\n\nHere, a host of different types of downloads will be available for free. The one you're looking for will be featured as Rosters. \n\n\nWhen I accessed this section, I could already find 2025 and 2026 draft classes with several downloads from the community.\n\n\nJust select one, and it will be downloaded. You can check this under the \"My Downloads\" section.\n\n\n\nThis completes the first part of the task.\n\n\nImage via Destructoid\n\n\nHow to load future draft classes in Madden NFL 25\n\n\nFor this part, you'll need a new save file.\n\n\n\nFrom the Download Center, go to the last option.\n\n\nHere, you can load your custom files. Load the one you downloaded with a future draft class.\n\n\nCreate a new Franchise mode save.\n\n\nMake sure to choose a custom squad instead of using a default one.\n\n\n\nThis will automatically load your custom squad file containing future draft prospects. Do remember that the community makes all such files. There might be a chance of something going wrong in your save in the future (it might not happen, but fair warning nevertheless).\n\nThe post How to use future draft classes in Madden NFL 25 Franchise mode appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Black Myth: Wukong is oftentimes compared to Soulslikes because of its difficulty and grand bosses, but are there settings to change that? If you want to get into the game but are scared of it potentially being really difficult, here’s what you need to know.\n\n\nCan you change difficulty settings in Black Myth: Wukong?\n\n\nUnfortunately, Black Myth: Wukong does not have difficulty setting options at this time. While the game might not be as difficult as Bloodborne, Sekiro, or Elden Ring, it’ll still pose quite the challenge. \n\n\nThe only way you can really alleviate the game’s difficulty is to farm up levels, or Sparks. Use them to further enhance your character’s abilities and you should hopefully turn the tide in battle against the dozens of bosses you’ll face ahead.\n\n\nAlso, you can skip a handful of bosses if you want, but it’s recommended that you don’t because they drop new items that can help you later down the line. They’ll also drop crafting materials for better gear and give you huge XP boosts upon beating them.\n\n\nYou can also upgrade your abilities like your spells and transformations so that you can deal more damage or have more use out of them, so use all you can if some of these battles are too tough.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nCan you summon NPCs or other players in Black Myth: Wukong?\n\n\nIf you were hoping that you could summon an NPC to take the aggro off of you in boss battles, you can’t do that. You’re mostly alone in this game.\n\n\nWith that said, you also can not summon other players via any sort of co-op or multiplayer session. It’s up to you to take on the game with the tools you have.\n\n\nSince Black Myth: Wukong is solely a single-player game, it can deter many who need a partner or a leg up against these tough bosses. No way are they in the same realm as actual Soulslikes, but they can still be a headache for many.\n\nThe post Does Black Myth: Wukong have difficulty settings? appeared first on Destructoid.",

And, after spending a few hours with its upcoming title, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, it looks like we're finally getting that successor, if not even more.\n\n\nInstead of controlling time like Max Caulfield, Lost Records has you direct moments with a video recorder as Swann, a young film enthusiast who completely embodies teenage awkwardness.

The platform's servers were targeted in a police raid just months after a French court ordered ISPs to block the site. Uptobox tried to reverse this decision, arguing that it's not the piracy haven rightsholders make it out to be, but the court denied that challenge.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",
