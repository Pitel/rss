Look at that capital \"C\", poking out of the middle like the bow on a present whose silhouette leaves nothing to the imagination. You already know broadly what this game involves, yes? Indeed, you do: it's a game about crafting spacecraft, so that you can travel to other planets and craft their resources into other, better spacecraft.

          "description": "How would a younger me react to the concept of game seasons? \"Leave me alone, please. I’m busy replaying The Suffering 2 for the sixth time to see a new 15 second cutscene that recognises which combination of morally aligned beginnings and endings I’ve picked. It reads your save from the first game and everything!\". Say ‘memory card’ to a youthful, broccoli-maned Fortnite enjoyer nowadays. Go on, I dare you. You’ll be in a home before you know it.\nStill, having new toys at regular intervals is one real upshot of our new live-service barrage of ephemeral novelty, perpetually flung at my dizzy eyeballs like gleaming carnival daggers at exhausted spinning wheels. Especially if they’re for the exquisite strategy of Mechabellum. Season 2 released yesterday alongside patch 1.2, bringing with it a new unit and specialist, some reworks, and lots of cosmetic bits I pretend not to care about but then get excited when I unlock a new one.\nRead more",

The concept for Judas is that you're trapped in a computer-run society housed aboard a colony ship, the Mayflower. The titular Judas has managed to break free of the AI-groomed status quo, and is out to start a revolution. \"Bioshock Infinite in space\", we called it, back in 2022, but Levine says it's more open-ended than either of his Bioshock endeavours, with a greater emphasis on other characters remembering and responding to your actions over time.\n Read more",

          "description": "I think the last time I read an actual, original Garfield comic was in 1998. Since then, my experience of the character has been one long litany of Gar-memes and in particular, Gorefield memes. For those blissfully unaware, Gorefield is a version of Jim Davis’s otiose, lasagna-loving housecat who has broken his comic strip shackles and become a cosmic abomination. Gorefield's manifestations are many: centipede Gorefields, arachnid Gorefields, Gorefields that extend serpentine necks of unfleshed bone towards a cowering Jon Arbuckle, demanding to be fed in a voice that sounds nothing like Bill Murray, a voice as deep and velvety as the eternal Monday before the Big Bang.\nIn Gar-Type, a free Gorefield fangame from Youtuber and pixel artist LumpyTouch, Garfield has become a planet. The good news is that, unlike many other Gore-variants, this Gorefield is vulnerable to bullets. It falls to ace pilot Jon Starbuckle and his prototype starfighter, Gar-Type D, to save the Earth from lasagnnihilation.\n Read more",

That's because the studio is still working on the tech behind it all, and plans to release two other games before it. Meaning it'll be 10-15 years before it actually comes out. \nGreene describes Artemis as an internet-like platform where users create and share things, but doesn't say specifically what those things might be. He doesn't know how his user-led \"multiverse of worlds\" will be moderated, or how it will prevent copyright infringement, or what makes this idea distinct from, say, Roblox.

But this is the first time they've properly blogged about it, sharing details of a gruelling switchover to Unreal Engine 5 and a couple of new screens.

I think that's the big theme of my selection box: being grounded within my player character. I want to feel what it's like to hike through canyons with too much sellable loot in my backpack. I want to park my soul in the head of a scared Scotsman way out of his depth, hundreds of miles from shore. The closer I can comfortably fit in my character's shoes, the more I seem to buy into the world they inhabit. Even if that world is constantly glowing a magnificent crimson. \nRead more",

          "description": "My selection box isn't really a selection box. It's a tray of barely-nibbled leftovers, hastily lifted from my Steam backlog. One of the disadvantages of being news editor, you see, is that I have  developed a goldfish-grade attention span. In my hectic pursuit of the next scoop, or the next Elden Ring update changelog, I snatch and cast aside game demos like a pickpocket speedrunning the checkout line at Harvey Nichols. I'm dimly aware that some of these cast-aside games are Very Good. A few might even deserve to be played for longer than 30 minutes. I feel immensely guilty about that. Perhaps a little... existential, too. I have measured out my life in tutorial levels. \r\n\n\r\nSo! Rather than digging out three of the games I've actually completed this year, such as The Crush House, Death Of A Wish and Mask Quest, I'm going to gamble on recommending a few I've barely scratched, but which sure feel excellent and have attracted a positive critical consensus. If I am false in this assessment, may Horace the Endless Bear bite my head off for my impudence. Let's begin.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Instead, I want to talk about mini PCs – not just small-form-factor desktops, but properly tiny, box o’ chocolates-sized computers – which have, of course, been around for decades.\nRecently, however, I’ve been wondering if mini PCs are finally on the cusp of having their moment as serious games machines. Between rising desktop component prices and ever-ballooning electricity bills, it would make sense that a smaller, cheaper system would take on a new appeal, and the success of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally show that convenience still trumps out-and-out performance for a lot of PC players. There have even been hints that Valve are resurrecting their Steam Machine mini PC concept, years after a flopping first attempt. Should you be interested?\nRead more",

          "description": "Clambering deep out of the Contemplation Pit, where reading reviews or opinions or, god help you, Takes, is forbidden, I am curious to learn how people have been categorising Songs of Silence. Its structure most resembles Songs of Conquest or Heroes of Might and/or Magic, but with little RPG emphasis or base building, and minimal tactical fighting.\nTaxonomy is arbitrary and often unimportant at the end of the day, but I am very glad to firmly rule it out of one category: It's not a bloody card game. It looks like one, sure. You do most things with cards, and characters acquire more cards over time. But even if you absolutely, utterly, and correctly loathe card-based systems, this game has none.\nRead more",

My weakest skeletons, sensing their death coming, explode into fire and shards. My strongest skeletons fight so hard and with such alacrity that upon dying, they drag their spirits together and keep fighting as ghosts for a while. Foul little bone scorpions skitter around on fans of legs made from human hands. Somewhere in the middle, almost invisible among the noise, is the character I am actually playing: Path of Exile 2’s mean-spirited, callous, and gleefully enjoyable Witch.\nThis is a review in progress. It has to be. Even in its incomplete early access period, Path of Exile 2 is a great sprawling mass of a game. Three meaty acts of a planned six act campaign are followed by a trickier return tour through them, before the absurd endgame kicks into gear and the real work begins. If I came to you having played everything on offer I would be wild-haired, bloodshot-eyed and possessing perfect, incomprehensible knowledge. Let’s compromise: I have toured the dark caverns and the antediluvian crypts. I have been killed by various accumulated nasties. I’ve had a great time.\nRead more",

          "description": "The announcement of The Witcher 4 with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's Ciri as protagonist has attracted a bit of discussion. Some of the reaction is online toddlers waxing wroth about a video game having a (somewhat older!!!) woman as lead character, and especially, shock, a video game in a series that has hitherto starred a man. And some of it is people commenting more thoughtfully on whether Ciri genuinely makes for a suitable Witcher protagonist, given that she isn't the product of the typical Witcher genetic modification regime (which is heavily tailored towards men), and given that, without spoiling too much, she has gifts that make crumbly old Geralt's sword-and-sorcery skillset look rather paltry. \r\n\n\nSpeaking to Eurogamer this week, game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber responded to a few of these comments, and also shared a little about Ciri's situation at the start of the game.\r\n \nRead more",

Later, I examined the senator's personal history more thoroughly and discovered he was \"hated by bears for cooking them a rancid meal.\" I suppose every politician has their enemies. \nThat Caves Of Qud creates fun anecdotes out of simple encounters shouldn't be a surprise. It has had 15 years of early access to establish itself as a small-but-mighty story generating roguelike of repute (there's a reason it sits deservedly side-by-side with Dwarf Fortress in the same publishing house). After creating many characters, and dying and dying and dying again, I understand why it grips the brain with such fierce glee. It is a machine of grand imagination and adventuresome comedy. A deceptively powerful RPG that isn't half as obtuse to newcomers as the screenshots make it out to be. Qud's low-res bark is just a complement to its bite.\nRead more",

          "description": "After much teasing, the vicious tyrants of Arrowhead Games and their noxious puppets, the \"democratic government\" of Super Earth, have announced the very first Helldivers 2 licensed crossover. In yet another hollow display of solidarity and \"Liber-tea\", they've teamed up with the loathsome fascists of Killzone, the elderly shooter series from Sony and Guerrilla Games.\nFrom today, you'll be able to buy weapons, armour and cosmetics belonging to Killzone's despicable stormtroopers from the Helldivers Superstore, and there's the suggestion of an additional Killzone-themed reward depending on the fortunes of the so-called Galactic War, a xenocidal bloodbath couched as an exercise in bringing \"freedom\" to the upstanding socialist Automatons, the blameless wildlife of the Tyranids, and the Wellsian cosplayers of the recently added Illuminate faction.\nWe here at Rock Paper Shotgun stand against Super Earth and Arrowhead's wanton aggression, which absolutely isn't a big satirical joke based on some Verhoeven film or other. Anyway, those capes. Find an image and further details below.\r\n \nRead more",

Sin once described writing news articles for our former news editor Alice0 (RPS in peace) as like practising backflips in front of the kung fu master. Writing about a new city builder at Sin's suggestion is like being invited to budget the development of Londinium by Julius Caesar.\nThe terror of screwing it up - together with other, more trivial distractions, like international games industry conferences - has stopped me from writing about Times Of Progress for months. Today I bite the bullet, and emerge from my lodgings to issue a hesitant speech to the masses, hoping like hell that Caesar is too preoccupied with the latest Gaul uprising to notice my errors.\r\n \nRead more",

If, like me, you really enjoyed the French developers' previous martial art sims, you might, like me, find this news deflating. Football? We already have that at home. It's like a martial art, but all you get to kick is some... ball.\nI'm not sure I'll ever entirely swallow my disappointment, but credit where it's due, Rematch does look like both an enjoyable game and a quietly disruptive one. It's also struck a chord with me inasmuch as it's a new way into the culture of a sport which I have pretty mixed feelings about.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "A master thief creeps over cobbles in an early modern metropolis that splits the difference between Edinburgh, Glasgow and Liverpool. Lit by gaslamps that can’t quite dispel the industrial haze, they pass for a civilian - a rough one, admittedly, but not shady enough to cause an itch in the swordarm of any passing guard.\nUntil, that is, they take to the thieves’ highway - following the trajectory of their grappling hook upward to the rooftops, from which they can see the shape of the city, and the moon beyond. Up here, it’s a parallel world - the trees on street level answered by chimney stacks, and the distant hills echoed by the rise and fall of steep gables. “We’re super proud of these rooftops,” says Greg LoPiccolo. “It’s an amazing landscape that we put a lot of thought and effort into, and it’s a lot of fun to traverse.”\nBack in 1998, LoPiccolo was the game director who saw Thief: The Dark Project to completion. Today - after an 18 year detour to Harmonix to lead projects like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, among other adventures - he’s the game director of Thick as Thieves. “It really is an opportunity to do something unique and cool and new, on the shoulders of this stuff that is now well-respected,” he says. “Thief has some legs, right? People still talk about it to some degree.”\nRead more",

          "description": "Palworld has its own laws and if you break them, then you will get wanted status. Once you get that status, PIDF officers will start chasing you. Fortunately, you can get rid of this dilemma and remove the wanted status, and the steps aren't that complicated. Here’s everything you need to know to remove the wanted status in Palword.\n\n\nHow to remove Wanted Status in Palworld\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nOne of the easiest options that you can do to remove the wanted status is to exit the game and reload your save. I know this is something not everyone will prefer, but trust me, it works wonders. What’s even better is that you will remove the wanted status without losing any items or resources.\n\n\nIf you don’t want to quit the game, you can always kill the PIDF officers who are chasing you. This approach might not be suitable for you unless you are up for a battle.\n\n\nAnother effective method to remove the wanted status is to simply run away. The PIDF will chase you for a while, but if you manage to stay ahead of them for long enough, they will eventually give up. Once they stop chasing, your wanted status will be removed. Another way to run away is to fly high above. It is possible to fly vertically upward to escape the PIDF with a flying mount. After a while, you can see that the wanted status is gone for good. \n\n\nIn case you like being stealthy, you can kill all witnesses to remove the wanted status in Palworld. Just like it says, a crime isn’t a crime until someone witnesses it.\n\n\nLastly, and not my favorite, if you’re looking for a more dramatic way to go, you can give up and die. You just have to let the PIDF take you out, and your wanted status will be erased. Of course, you will lose all your items, so it is best to do this near a fast travel point if you want to retrieve your stuff after respawning.\n\nThe post How to remove Wanted Status in Palworld appeared first on Destructoid.",

Animal Crossing: New Horizons has a way of pulling you back in, though. \n\n\nThere’s an undeniable appeal about escaping reality to cultivate your own getaway island community of interesting, albeit sometimes irritating, characters. Even though Tom Nook is a capitalist overlord, that detail can be overlooked thanks to the charm of having full design control. \n\n\nBut it’s understandable if you don’t want to dive right back in where you left off, especially if it’s been months or years since you last played and aren’t sure what you put where or why.

This is the latest style to be added as part of the recent update, and it can be obtained in the game.\n\n\nAs with any new addition, the recent style is pretty strong in the current meta. Let's take a look at how you can obtain it, and we will then dive into its stats.\n\n\nHow to obtain the Reo Style in Blue Lock Rivals\n\n\nTo obtain the new style, you'll have to try your luck by spinning for it. The process is pretty simple, and all you have to do is select the style button at the bottom to open the customization section. Next, you can start spending your style spins and try getting the Reo style.\n\n\nThis is easier said than done, for the rate of obtaining a legendary style is 2%. In a nutshell, you'll either have to get incredibly lucky with your pull or invest a lot of resources. Thankfully, there are plenty of ways to get mor spins, with the easiest one being codes. Make sure to check out the full list of all the available codes to get more resources.\n\n\n\n\nIs the Reo Style worth it in Blue Lock Rivals\n\n\nIn one word, yes. Here are the different abilities of the new style.\n\n\n\nV Move (Offensive): Increases Shot Power and Pass Strength.\n\n\nV Move (Defensive): Increases Tackle Speed of the player.\n\n\nC Move - Copy abilities of another player.\n\n\nB Awakening Move: Copy the Awakening Ability of any player in the game.\n\n\n\nIt's pretty clear that both the C Move and the B Awakening Move can be absolute game-changers. When executed properly, it can completely change the tide of a match.

The mode has many similarities with the core gameplay, but there are a few subtle differences. The main objective is to score the most eliminations to win matches, which will help you win Tickets.\n\n\nLet's take a look at how you can dominate the Dodgeball LTM.\n\n\nHow to win Dodgeball LTM in Blade Ball\n\n\nThe Dodgeball LTM is a team-versus-team mode, with the objective of scoring as many eliminations as possible. Whichever team has more eliminations within the allotted time will be deemed the winner. The special mode shares many similarities with the basic gameplay, but you'll have to emphasize heavily on teamwork.\n\n\nApart from focusing on eliminating the opponents, you'll also have to save your teammates. Doing so will automatically reduce the chances of the other team getting more eliminations. Winning matches will help you to get Tickets, which can be used to get Dodgeball Crates.\n\n\n\n\nDodgeball Crate in Blade Ball explained\n\n\nThe Dodgeball Crate is the main set of rewards of the LTM and is available during the event. The core system relies on spins, and you'll need Tickets for them. One ticket is required for a spin, and you can get Blades, Emotes, and Explosions.\n\n\nHere are the applicable odds for each spin of the Dodgeball Crate.\n\n\n\nCrystal Blade: 0.05%\n\n\nBlizzard Skater: 1%\n\n\nLet it Snow Emote: 2.9%\n\n\nIcy Puck Blade: 5%\n\n\nIced Surroundings Emote: 6%\n\n\nSnowboard Edge: 15%\n\n\nFrosty Goal Explosion: 15%\n\n\nIce Rink Burst Explosion: 25%\n\n\nFrosty Dagger: 30%\n\n\n\nThe Crystal Blade is a type of exclusive reward, as it can be claimed a maximum of 5,000 times.

          "description": "Have you looked through your entire collection in Pokémon TCG Pocket and noticed that you may be missing Promo Card 8 (or 008)? For completionists and collectors, this can be bothersome, but don’t fret.\n\n\nIf you’re missing this Promo Card, this is why.\n\n\nWhat is Promo Card 008 in Pokémon TCG Pocket?\n\n\nFirst off, Promo Card 008 in Pokémon TCG Pocket is a variant of the Pokédex Trainer Card. It’ll show artwork of the three Kanto starters (Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle) along with a Pikachu looking at a Pokédex. \n\n\nIt has the same effect as using the other versions of this card.\n\n\nImage via The Pokemon Company, art by Yuu Nishida\n\n\nHow to get Promo Card 008\n\n\nIf you’re wondering how to get this card, you cannot do so at the time of writing. It hasn’t been made available in the game yet, so don’t worry that you may have missed out on this. \n\n\nIt’ll be made available in the future through some kind of Wonder Pick or Drop events, similar to the Blastoise one, Lapras EX, and more. When the event comes up, you’ll have a good amount of time to get your hands on this so you can complete the entire collection the game has to offer so far.\n\n\nIs Promo Card 008 worth it?\n\n\nIf you’re a player who only plays Pokémon TCG Pocket competitively, you won’t be at a huge loss if you don’t have this card in your inventory. The Pokédex Trainer card doesn’t provide too much worth in meta decks.\n\n\nThe only reason why you’d want to have this card in your deck is for completion purposes. Other than that, it’s just a pretty card to look at as it gathers virtual dust in the other hundreds of cards surrounding it. \n\n\nWe’ll let you know when the event arrives so you can snag this Trainer card for completion’s sake.\n\nThe post What is Promo Card 008 in Pokémon TCG Pocket? appeared first on Destructoid.",

The result of the poor performance reportedly comes down not just to the incredibly prohibitive price but also to a lack of content.\n\n\n\n\nApple is reportedly still developing the Apple Vision gen 2, though its production has seemingly also halted due to the original's poor performance. Though things look dire for the product, Apple hasn't fully stopped production, rather just slowed it down, looking to bring it back to full steam should the Vision Pro's sales ever pick up. Apple is seemingly also looking into making a cheaper headset, which would be an effective way to deal with the Vision Pro's greatest issue.\n\n\nBloomberg had previously reported that Apple was looking into incorporating Apple AI into the future versions of the device, so we'll see how this news affects those plans.\n\n\nMany of the mistakes committed by Apple in the making of the Vision Pro could've been averted simply by looking at the high-priced and low-selling PSVR2 headset. Instead, Apple chose to make an even more expensive and even less interesting product.\n\n\nYou can currently still acquire the original Apple Vision Pro for its original price.\n\nThe post Apple reportedly halted production of the ridiculously expensive Apple Vision Pro because of poor demand appeared first on Destructoid.",

Incidentally, the glitch was triggered by a free pack that is part of an ongoing objective. It's safe to say that those who managed to complete the objective late have been rewarded with a New Year's gift.\n\n\nEA FC 25 Erling Haaland Winter Wildcards glitch explained\n\n\nIt all starts with the Season 4 Weekly Play Completionist objective, which rewards players with special packs. To earn these packs, players have to complete certain tasks every week. So far, players have managed to complete the objective tasks for Week 1, which rewards players with a guaranteed Winter Wildcards/Winter Wildcards Hero pack.\n\n\nThis pack on its own is pretty special, as you're guaranteed a promo card (excluding icons). However, those who have managed to either save the pack or complete it just in time were almost guaranteed a Winter Wildcards Erling Haaland. Most of those who have opened the pack late have ended up receiving the ST version of the Norwegian striker.\n\n\n\n\nAs of writing, the card costs over a million coins on the Ultimate Team market. Technically, someone could have been incredibly lucky and ended up receiving the item from the pack. However, what happened tonight is certainly a glitch. It reminds me of a similar incident that happened last year in January when an SBC inexplicably ended up giving a TOTY Messi card to many.\n\n\nIt remains to be seen if EA Sports will take any action regarding what has happened and if there will be some sort of compensation in the future.\n\nThe post EA FC 25 glitch ends up gifting guaranteed Erling Haaland Winter Wildcards in Ultimate Team appeared first on Destructoid.",

Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.
