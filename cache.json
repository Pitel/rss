In Europe the policy of not allowing refunds on eShop pre-orders led to legal action, a case that Nintendo won pending appeal. Now, however, the German court of appeal has reversed that decision following work by the Federation of German Consumer Organisations (VZBV) and The Norwegian Consumer Council.\nNintendo had already changed its policy slightly in September 2020, allowing pre-orders more than 7 days ahead of a game's release to be cancelled directly on the eShop or via Nintendo Account pages. For example when we tested this today, selecting a pre-order for a game out in less than 7 days showed 'pre-order and purchase', making clear that there would be no right to an immediate 'voluntary right to cancel'. When you select a game more than 7 days from release you get a lengthy page explaining your right to cancel up to that point, with payment and pre-loading also held off until a week before release. This customer page explains the process for cancelling, too.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Paper Mario is the first addition after nearly two months.\nIt's fair to say that the announcement and launch of the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack could have gone better. The Nintendo Switch Online Subscription service wasn't exactly blessed with a spotless reputation prior to the reveal of the premium tier, either. Though some of the YouTube downvotes may have been a joke from some, others have clearly felt that the offering is poor value, or perhaps object to Nintendo's approach to online services and retro games when compared to rival services on the market.\n\nNintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack Price, Games And Feature\n\nThe perspective on value is also, possibly, heavily dependent on whether you play and still enjoy Animal Crossing: New Horizons. As the premium tier includes the brilliant Happy Home Paradise expansion, it immediately offers a good deal if you want to dive into that content, especially if you take advantage of a Family Group to save money. If you're not a fan of Animal Crossing, though, the dynamic undoubtedly shifts as you're limited (at this point) to nine Nintendo 64 games and 14 SEGA Mega Drive / Genesis titles.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

This may sound like we’ve skipped straight to the end of this review a few paragraphs early but as it’s been a full decade since DoDonPachi Resurrection’s English Xbox 360 release, more than that since it debuted in Japanese arcades, and several years since its Steam port, there’s no point keeping anyone in suspense: this hypnotic mixture of bullets, lasers, and shiny collectibles is without a doubt one of the best of its type.\nIt’s also one of the most flexible of its type too, with eight very different ways to play and seven of those featuring extensive training options, allowing anyone to practise all levels, bosses, and even mid-bosses under any conditions imaginable. The options available go so far that, as with Espgaluda II, anyone who has a burning desire to display the main screen slightly off to the left at 107% magnification with the background image auto-changing every 38 seconds in one specific mode can do so if they wish.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

By my third restart I'd abandoned all interest in playing any character I wanted, and started trying to estimate whatever would get this over with sooner. Mechajammer is a disaster.

          "description": "The original Elex was divisive, to say the least. It was a game in which I was perpetually lonely and confused and being battered to death by carcinogenic poultry, but it must have been a profitable enough venture on its own terms to warrant a follow-up. That follow-up is Elex II, which is still several months away from release right now, but one I've been playing an early preview build of recently, showing off the first chapter of the game.\nI was talking to Graham (RPS in peace) about this and he said: \"Eventually one of these RPG sci-fi fantasy things will get close enough to being a BioWare game that it makes loads of money.\" This being the games equivalent of monkeys and typewriters. But although I agreed with Graham at the time, I think comparing it to BioWare might be mistaking the particular appeal of Elex II. It would be too simple to say that I \"enjoyed\" the hours I have spent with it so far. I didn't not enjoy it. I mostly came away respecting it for how little it respected me. Like the popular kids on the playground making life so difficult for you that you wish to become best friends with them.\nRead more",

It’s a unique combination of deck-building and turn-based strategy, presented in satisfying and stylish 3D animation. Sort of Superhot meets Slay The Spire. \r\n\n\r\n  In Fights In Tight Spaces, you play as an anonymous secret agent with the aim of assassinating bosses, while moving through the game's multiple chapters. On the way to each boss are several smaller encounters, which act as opportunities for you to get some practice in. You take turns planning the best way to take out roomfuls of enemies, and eventually upgrade your skills and continue the cycle.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's described as the largest update to Dead Cells yet, and is designed as an ending to the route started by the two previous DLCs (The Bad Seed and Fatal Falls). I think it’s going for more of a The Lighthouse vibe, and not so much The Little Mermaid. You can take a look at the new teaser trailer below.\nRead more",

This is the fifth patch for the game since its initial launch near the end of July 2021. This one includes fixes for various crashes, increases to the stability in co-op play, improvements to the audio, as well as other miscellaneous changes. \r\n\n\r\nThe patch also adds a new feature called Transmogrification, which you’re probably familiar with if you’ve played games like Destiny 2 or World Of Warcraft. In the words of Neon Giant, this’ll allow players to “change their appearance to match the visual style of any armour currently in their inventory by visiting the Stylist and paying a small fee.” Once that’s done, you can equip any armour you want, and your character’s look won’t change.\r\n \nRead more",

Whatever the case may be, Cyber Monday is still a weird 90s relic, like many other things with cyber as a prefix. Cybergoth, for example, a sub-sub-culture whose chief point of relevance in the modern era is having their entire aesthetic appropriated by gaming peripheral manufacturers. You can’t move for black and neon doohickeys with LEDs dripping from every orifice. While I’ll be the first to argue that anything is better than the beige everything of yesteryear, sometimes you need to be a bit grown-up and accessorise your PC with reliable, understated, no-nonsense black.

The twists, the turns, the drama: it all makes Merge Mansion seem like it must be bananas.\nIn that original advert, a bride gets out of a taxi to find her house (and presumably husband) is on fire. Her grandmother takes care of her and unlocks the gate to a huge mansion, which the woman begins rennovating. Then out of nowhere the cops come and arrest grandma, and she presses her hand to the inside of the police car window where, Lost-style, she's written a message on the palm of her hand reading \"He is alive\". I was reminded of it this weekend because I saw a similar ad where a policeman comes to the house to arrest grandma and she escapes on a motorbike, pulling a sick wheelie.\nRead more",

Even a modest gaming rig will be filled with  components kicking out heat for long periods of time, so it's vital to equip your CPU with a competent cooler like the Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo V2.\nThankfully, Cyber Monday is here with a deal that knocks a few quid off what was already an affordable chiller, making it even better for first-time builders and anyone looking to upgrade from stock coolers on a limited budget.\nRead more",

While today usually marks the last chance to jump on any lingering Black Friday deals, there can and will be some shiny new savings on PC gaming hardware as well – hardware like the Gigabyte B550M DS3H, a microATX motherboard that’s dropped into prime territory for first-time builders on tight budgets.\r\n\n\r\nAmazon has it for just £55, which is chump change for a mobo that’s compatible with both AMD Ryzen 3000 chips and the latest Ryzen 5000 series. That’s down from its £73 price tag on Black Friday itself, and down from a £100 RRP.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I’m still here though, highlighting deals for you, because we’re in deals season now and the ride is going to continue all through to Christmas and the New Year beyond! The whole Black Friday phenomenon is very weird if you’re old enough to predate online shopping and not from the USA. Feels like just yesterday that everyone was terrified of using their credit cards online, Amazon was just a book shop and Thanksgiving was just something you only heard of on American TV shows. Now it’s another huge American export, allowing retailers to extend their discounting shenanigans for a whole extra month. The worst thing about it is that our colonial cousins keep some of the best bargains for themselves, as is the case with this Razer BlackWidow V3 mechanical keyboard.\r\n\n \nRead more",

A few days later, I opened the package that arrived to find, not the slightly dodgy cast-off I’d expected, but a shiny SteelSeries Arctis 5. I’m not someone who gets good quality peripherals very often and the sheer generosity made me shed more than a few tears.

That game is The Vale: Shadow Of The Crown, an audio-only RPG about a blind princess fighting to save her kingdom. You may have seen it nominated in the Innovation in Accessibility category of The Game Awards this year, and frankly if it doesn't win then a great disservice will have been done. A stark contrast to the other, all very AAA nominees in its category, The Vale doesn't rely on flashy visuals to tell its story. In fact, it barely has any graphics at all. Instead, it conjures its world - and tense fighting sequences - from sound alone, creating an experience like nothing else I've ever played. \nRead more",

This puzzling creation is just one of the many combatants in Zynga's Star Wars: Hunters, a Switch and mobile game that is slated to release next year.\nStar Wars: Hunters is a free-to-play multiplayer game that takes some real chances with its roster. You won't see recognizable characters like Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, or Boba Fett battling to the death. Zynga is instead making its own lineup of warriors from the Outer Rim. Another odd one is named Slingshot, which just happens to be a droideka piloted by an Ugnaught. There's also a droid named J-3DI, which t…",

While the feature set of the Xbox Series X is impressive (not to mention its stellar backward compatibility library), you probably want some games to play on that beast of a console.\nThe team at Game Informer worked together to compile a list of the 10 games we think are the best on Xbox Series X/S.

However, only one series came to mind as I skated across its teal clouds: Sonic the Hedgehog. More specifically, the 3D entries, which are the oft-maligned titles responsible for decades of headaches for the Blue Blur. \nI’ll admit that I’m a Sonic traditionalist. My love of Sonic, like many other 30-somethings, began on the Sega Genesis, so I firmly believe the character is at his best in 2D. Sonic 2 is my favorite in the series and Sonic Mania, the 2017 throwback developed by a team of fans rather than Sonic Team proper, is the best entry in years. \nThe 3D installments have never gotten Sonic right.

          "description": "The first game from Embark Studios, a veteran team led by former EA and Dice head Patrick Söderlund, is set to be revealed this week. The game is called Arc Raiders, and we got a glimpse of what to expect in a cryptic teaser video.\nThe video is one of those “trailer for the trailer” as it states a full reveal is slated for Thursday, December 9. Hey, that’s the same day as The Game Awards — what a funny coincidence. The video shows some third-person shooting, a woman calling for volunteers, and an “Enlist. Resist” tagline. You can watch the teaser in the tweet below.\npic.twitter.com/JPsq7mL4hP\nDecember 6, 2021\nWe first caught wind of Embark’s new game last November, when the studio began hiring for a PvP team-based shooter and shared concept art of the project. It seems safe to assume that Arc Raiders is this project, but we’ll find out for sure soon enough. Embark was formed in 2018 after Söderlund departed EA earlier that same year. The team is based in Stockholm, Sweden, and boasts roughly 200 employees as of November 2020. The company’s mission statement, according to its website, is “to blur the line between playing and making,” and many of the posts have centered on showcasing development tools.\nWhat do you think about this first tease for Arc Raiders? Any guesses as to what kind of game it could be? Share your thoughts in the comments!",

Partnering with the cast and crew from the upcoming film, The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal Engine 5 Experience will show off what the new software can do.\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nThe Matrix Resurrections director Lana Wachowski is involved in bringing this tech showcase to life, and so are the film's stars, Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss, who provide performances for Awakens. The trailer for the Unreal experience is exceptionally short, only providing a couple of seconds of Reeves doing what's demanded of him in a bright white void: questioning existence, asking, \"How do we know what is real,\" which is a question that's probably pointed at his own physical being in the trailer, a near-lifelike recreation of the well-known actor. Or else he's messing with us, and that is actually Keanu on film. To that, I say, kudos for making me question three seconds of footage all day.\nThe Matrix Awakens is available now to pre-load on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Stay tuned for more info on the experience at The Game Awards this Thursday. \nHow hyped are you to return to The Matrix? Will you be stocking up on dark, glossy clothing and tiny sunglasses for the new movie and this UE5 experience? Let us know in the comments!",

          "description": "A senior executive at Sony was fired after being caught in an alleged pedophile sting video posted online. \nGeorge Cacioppo was a senior vice president of engineering for Sony for over eight years, having worked on products such as the PlayStation Store and more. Over the weekend, the amateur pedophile-busting YouTube channel People v. Preds posted a video online that accused him of trying to meet with a 15-year-old boy. After the video began to pick up steam, Sony told CNET that Cacioppo had been fired. \n“We are aware of the situation and the employee in question has been terminated from employment,” Sony told CNET in a statement on Sunday. \nCNET attempted to contact Cacioppo via his LinkedIn profile but did not receive a comment. At the time of this writing, the former vice president of engineering has not publicly commented on the video or his subsequent termination from Sony. \nPeople v. Preds told Kotaku that its videos are posted online publicly rather than turned into police for an official investigation, because “the police department doesn’t work with ‘Cyber groups’ like us,” and that “that’s when the internet takes over.” However, People v. Preds also told Kotaku that “evidence has been turned into the authorities.” \nThe video, which is still publicly available for viewing, shows Cacioppo in a PlayStation 5 shirt being accused by People v. Preds of trying to meet with a 15-year-old he met on Grindr. CNET says Cacioppo told the 15-year-old that his name was “Jeff” and that “Jeff” gave the teen an address for the two to meet and have sex. \nThe San Diego Police Department has received People v. Preds’ evidence, but police have released no public information regarding this incident. It’s still unclear if this will developer into a case, but regardless, Cacioppo is no longer a Sony employee. \n[Source: CNET]",

Marvel boss Kevin Feige finally announced the news, long-rumored to be in the works, in an interview with CinemaBlend and in it, he revealed that while Cox’s casting has been announced, where we’ll first see him remains a secret. \n“If you were to see Daredevil in upcoming things, Charlie Cox, yes, would be the actor playing Daredevil,” Feige said. “Where we see that, how we see that, when we see that, remains to be seen.” \nFans have long speculated that Cox would be returning to the role in the MCU, with some hoping he makes a more lawyer-related appearance in Marvel and Sony’s upcoming Spider-Man: No Way Home (Peter Parker is in need of a lawyer, after all, considering he’s been accused of killing Quentin Beck aka Mysterio). Perhaps that’s what Feige is alluding to – it’s also possible that the MCU hasn’t quite figured out Daredevil’s first outing, meaning Feige wouldn’t have much to say on Cox’s role in the universe just yet. \nOnly time will tell, but for those who have watched Daredevil, today’s news is sure to be welcome. Daredevil is largely viewed as Netflix’s best Marvel series, in no small part due to Cox’s role as the vigilante. If you haven’t yet seen Cox as Daredevil, the entire Netflix series is worth watching. Plus, some have speculated that Kingpin, the villain throughout the Daredevil series, might be making an appearance in Marvel’s ongoing Disney+ show, Hawkeye. \n[Source: CinemaBlend]\nAre you excited about Charlie Cox’s return to Daredevil?

He also said that in today’s Xbox ecosystem, Bungie might have stayed with Microsoft. \n“Could we [keep Bungie around] today? I think we could,” Spencer told Axios when asked if Bungie’s departure was inevitable. \nSpencer said that since Bungie’s departure, Xbox has learned a lot but understands why the studio left. \n“At the time, they had big ambitions,” Spencer said. “They had sold their business for a certain amount of money. They saw what Halo turned into. And it’s like, ‘Okay, Microsoft benefited more than Bungie did from the success of Halo.’ There’s no other story that can be written there.” \nSpencer continued and said he understands the appeal of becoming independent, citing that Bungie probably felt like it had another Halo-like franchise in them. \n“If you’re saying, ‘Hey, I think I’ve got another one of those in me. I want to really take another chance,’ I can understand the allure of doing that as an independent company,” the Xbox head said.\nBungie formally split from Microsoft, with whom it had made multiple Halo games, in 2007. On October 5 of that year, Bungie announced the split and said it had become an independent company. In the division, though, Microsoft retained all rights to Halo, a franchise now developed primarily by 343 Industries.\nNearly three years later, Bungie signed onto a ten-year publishing deal with Activision, with which its popular Destiny franchise would begin. In January of 2019, the studio announced that it had ended this publishing deal early, meaning Bungie was independent once more. It seems that Bungie intends to retain its independence for now. \n[Source: Axios]\nDo you think Bungie would be a good fit for Microsoft today? Let us know in the comments below!",

Epic recommends content creators and players record their playthrough as it will be the only way to see it again.\nThe End allows for groups of up to 16 players to queue together. Friends can get together 30 minutes before the event begins. This current season is ending a day earlier than Epic originally announced, so anyone who logs in now between December 4 will receive a 225,000 XP reward.

This week, we're tackling the franchise's most reviled – or misunderstood – entry: Metroid: Other M. \nReleased for the Wii on August 31, 2010, Metroid: Other M saw Nintendo pass the development reins to Team Ninja, the studio most famous for the 3D Ninja Gaiden games. With a new developer came a drastic new vision for the series. A considerable emphasis on narrative gave Samus her first real speaking role (and boy does she talk) and the tale fleshed out her past life with the Galactic Federation.  We'll examine this polarizing narrative along with the development decisions behind Other M's blend of 2D and 3D gameplay.  \nJoin hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and special guest, MinnMax cohort and former GI editor Kyle Hilliard (@KyleMHilliard) as we unpack the history and lore of Metroid: Other M.

This new format and everything that comes with it will launch on December 9. \nAlchemy is built on the Standard format and its yearly rotation of sets. That means when the time comes for a year's worth of cards to drop out of Standard, they will lose legality in Alchemy as well. However, a pool of new, Arena exclusive cards will be added a few weeks after each Standard-legal set launches, meaning we'll see new batches of digital cards every few months.

The service, currently code-named Spartacus, will let PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 owners pay a monthly fee for access to a catalog of both modern and classic games. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nThe subscription will be spread across three different tiers and Bloomberg’s report says the first (and cheapest) tier will basically be what players get with PlayStation Plus at the moment. The second tier will open players up to a larger library of PlayStation 4 games and eventually PlayStation 5 games. The third tier would include the services of the first two tiers and access to “extended game demos, game streaming, and a library of classic PS1, PS2, PS3, and PSP games,” Bloomberg writes. \nBloomberg’s report points towards Spartacus releasing in Spring, which is also when PlayStation Plus and Now will be merged. Sony reportedly plans to keep Plus’ branding around after the new service is out, but Now will be phased out. One important thing to note is that Bloomberg says the documentation it reviewed revealed that details on the service have yet to be finalized so there’s a chance things could change between now and its supposed Spring release. \nWhile waiting to learn more about Spartacus, be sure to check out the December PlayStation Plus lineup. \n[Source: Bloomberg]\nDo you think this Spartacus service sounds like a true competitor to Xbox Game Pass?

Recent updates, such as Update 3, which was revealed yesterday, indicate that EA is committed to improving the 2042 experience. Now, new shake-ups at the company provide further evidence that EA is doubling down on Battlefield as a core franchise. \nIn a new report by GameSpot, these shake-ups and changes are detailed, including news that Respawn Entertainment lead Vince Zampella, the person currently in charge of Apex Legends and other studio projects, is now the head of Battlefield.

Oddly enough, despite Amalur being available on the Switch, THQ Nordic’s press release about today’s Fatesworn news doesn’t mention the Switch when it comes to platforms for the expansion. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\n“This year on December 14, the journey of the Fateless One continues,” THQ Nordic’s press release reads. “After the Crystal War has been fought and Gadlow has been defeated, the people of Amalur were hoping for peace to return to their lands. And although peace has indeed come to Amalur, rumors of a new threat are starting to spread, rising in the far west, the icy lands of Mithros. None other than Telogrus, the God of Chaos himself has awoken and is gathering followers to throw the whole world into chaos.” \nTHQ Nordic says Fatesworn adds a whole new storyline to Amalur, a new environment to explore, multiple new quests and missions, new Chaos Realm dungeons, extra gameplay mechanics, more weapons and armor, never-before-seen enemies, and more. It will also raise the level cap of Amalur to 50 and it features a new soundtrack by composer Grant Kirkhope.\nYou must own the base Kingdoms of Amalur: Re-Reckoning in order to purchase and play Fatesworn, which will be out on December 14. Perhaps more interesting than the content of Fatesworn is the fact that it’s an expansion for a game that came out 10 years ago. That’s quite unheard of in games, especially single-player ones.

The number one theory links The Foundation to Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, and for good reason – the character’s armor features a design that matches up nicely with Johnson’s tattoos. \nWe were all but confident that Johnson was The Foundation, but the actor’s new Twitter video today seems to finally confirm the role. Oddly enough, it comes by way of a ZOA energy drink ad in which Johnson is seen talking about ZOA while using words that match up with Fortnite – zero point, higher ground, foundation, and the universe, to name a few. \nLate night grind, POWERED BY @zoaenergy💥⚡️\n#ifyouknowyouknow 🦾 pic.twitter.com/admN7U9QKt\nDecember 2, 2021\nThen, as you can see above, he reaches into a fridge to grab a ZOA, and lo and behold, The Foundation’s helmet is sitting there. Of course, Johnson ignores it – cheeky – but then he returns right to using some Fortnite-centric words again. The tweet that accompanies his video also says “#ifyouknowyouknow” with a robotic arm beside it, so...uhh yeah, Johnson is The Foundation – we smell what you’re cooking. \nThe timing of this reveal is curious, too – Fortnite Chapter 3 is right around the corner. Perhaps The Foundation is primed to take on a more significant role in the battle royale’s story. Maybe we’ll hear Johnson’s voice as The Foundation in Chapter 3. Only time will tell for now. \nWhile waiting to learn more, check out this trailer that shows Fortnite Chapter 2 is coming to an end before Chapter 3 launches sometime soon. Check out Game Informer’s Fornite review after that, and then give Game Informer’s list of all Marvel and DC characters in Fortnite a look. \nAre you excited to see what The Rock is cooking?

Ultimate roster was finally complete, and now, the game’s balance tuning is also complete after a new update that’s now live. \nFirst reported by Kotaku, Nintendo revealed on Twitter that the latest Ultimate balance update, Ver. 13.0.1 has been distributed and will be “the last update related to the balance adjustments of the game.” However, Nintendo said that other updates might happen to fix problems related to Ultimate. Director Masahiro Sakura also used this update to give thanks to everyone involved. \nバランス調整もこれで完了です。調整関係者各位、おつかれさまでした。\nhttps://t.co/10X7YREOnJ\nDecember 2, 2021\n“Balance adjustment is now complete,” Sakurai writes on Twitter. “Thank you to everyone involved in the coordination. The fighters used in the top-ranked battles and the average online win rate are all different, so I think this is a generally desirable distribution.” \nThe actual update features nearly 60 changes to character moves, spanning 24 different fighters. There are damage increases, speed boosts, animation length changes, and much more. You can check out the full update patch notes here. As noted by Kotaku, there are quite a handful of buffs – more buffs than nerfs, even – so many of your favorite fighters are probably feeling a touch stronger than usual. \nFor more about Ultimate, check out our thoughts on it in Game Informer’s Super Smash Bros.

One player, in particular, named “Sakana,” posted a ridiculous clip (seen below) to Twitter, showcasing the stopping power of one of the franchise’s most popular rifles. With one sniper bullet, 23 players are eliminated in mere seconds. \n23人抜きスナイパー　#HaloInfinite pic.twitter.com/AjCoGewbL1\nNovember 30, 2021\nImpressive, right? Sure, Sakana got a bunch of buddies to stand single-file, but the results are still cool as hell. Watching the kill-points increase and the red-hued damage indicator flash per each downed Spartan is pretty satisfying. The only highlight that could top this would be if 23 players somehow lined up inadvertently in the middle of a standard multiplayer match. Let’s see how many people load into big team battles in the hopes of achieving this legendary feat. Trust me, you’re more likely to get a 23-player killing spree by playing the game mode normally. \nThis isn’t the only wild thing that people have done in Halo Infinite. We’ve seen players grapple the vehicle bumpers as if wakeboarding … but without the board. We’ve learned that Spartans can lob fusion coils with NFL-level arm strength. The list goes on and on and will likely extend to Infinite’s single-player mode when it releases on December 8 for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC. \nIf you’re a Halo fanatic like we are, be sure to enter the Swarovski sweepstakes for this crystallized Master Chief helmet and energy sword. And if you’re not an Xbox Games Pass member, then you’re missing out as Ultimate subscribers are slated to get access to monthly multiplayer bonuses.  Those’ll go nicely with the extra six-match XP that 343 Industries implemented in its latest Halo update. \nThat 23-player killing spree was nuts, right?

          "description": "Respawn Entertainment has announced that its first game, 2014’s multiplayer-only Titanfall, has been delisted from storefronts and will remain delisted for good. \nThis means that anyone who doesn’t own Titanfall digitally will now not be able to as it’s no longer available for purchase on digital storefronts. However, you could still technically find a physical copy and own it that way. Titanfall will also be removed from subscription services on March 1, 2022, which means it’ll be taken off Xbox Game Pass and EA Play that day. \nFortunately for those that do already own it, Respawn says it’s keeping servers live so actually playing it is still possible for the foreseeable future. \nstudio’s official announcement on Twitter reads. “It’s a game that showcased the ambitions of the studio when it was first released more than 7 years ago and it continues to be a beacon of innovation that we strive for in all of our games.\n\nWe’ve made the decision to discontinue new sales of the original Titanfall game starting today and we’ll be removing the game from subscription services on March 1, 2022. We will, however, be keeping servers live for the dedicated fanbase still playing and those who own the game and are looking to drop into a match. \n\nRest assured, Titanfall is core to Respawn’s DNA and this incredible universe will continue. Today in Titanfall 2 and Apex Legends, and in the future. This franchise is a north star for the caliber of experiences we will continue to create here at Respawn. Thank you from the entire Respawn team.” \n\n\n\nA note about Titanfall. pic.twitter.com/Ew232HkUIo\nDecember 1, 2021\nFor more about Titanfall, check out our thoughts on it in Game Informer’s Titanfall review and then read what we thought of its sequel in Game Informer’s Titanfall 2 review.
