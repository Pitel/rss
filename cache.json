If you’ve never heard of him, the 60-year-old has been in game coding and development, and seemingly happily off his rocker since 1979. Going by the moniker ‘Yak’, Minter cut his teeth on the Sinclair ZX60 in the early '80s, going on to form his own development studio, Llamasoft.\nHaving won a loyal following over the years thanks to visually disarming, aurally arresting and crudely dazzling arcade game score challenges, Minter is probably best known for Tempest 2000 (1994), a launch title for the Atari Jaguar that remains the system’s best exclusive. Its unique hallucinogenic style and breakneck urgency has gone on to define much of his output since, from Space Giraffe to Polybius, leading to the unsubstantiated but common inference that the programmer dabbles in psychedelic drugs.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

They're tailor-made for this kind of tie in, and we're quite surprised that this is the first time this has been done.

          "description": "If you’re British and you’re old, then you love the ZX Spectrum. (Or the Commodore 64, I suppose, but not both. Never both.) Personally, I’m what they called a “Speccy” kid, and I have carried a deep and profound love of the elderly microcomputer’s cassette tape screeches, colour clash and long, long load times into my adult life, despite the fact that – and please don’t get upset, purists – many of the great Spectrum games don’t hold up in the cold light of the modern day. It’s not that the games are necessarily bad, more that they were tremendous for their time. Still eminently enjoyable, but they require the player to get their head into a certain zone, to put up with what are inarguably quite archaic controls and mechanics. \r\n\n\r\nOddly enough, there are some Spectrum games on Steam, thanks to a publisher called Pixel Games. However, with the utmost respect to their output… these are not the kind of games that are going to foster interest in the Speccy amongst modern players. Of course, that may well not be the point, but I’d be a little taken aback if even avowed old-school gamers were going to bother picking up the likes of gardening simulator Pedro, a game that scored 63% in Newsfield’s iconic Crash magazine back in the day, or Sam Stoat: Safebreaker, which did a little better at 68%.\nRead more",

They all force a little chuckle out of me, but none of them have made me belly laugh like I Am Jesus Christ, a first-person retelling of Christ’s tale from birth, to death, to rebirth.  \r\n\n\r\nI Am Jesus Christ’s genre is slightly murky, although, it almost looks like a giant Skyrim mod complete with unfeeling NPCs, first-person spellcasting, and an open world full of quest markers. The newest trailer shows some of Christ’s cool abilities like walking on water, shooting light beams at Satan, and fishing - which is incidentally what I’m looking forward to the most. \r\n\n\r\nIn fairness, the Christ sim looks like a pretty robust and thorough retelling of his journey, depicting scenes like the Last Supper, only this time all the disciples have exclamation marks above their heads. The Steam page also details 30 different miracles (or spells) and a number of different areas to explore. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Like all good fairytale characters, Pinocchio gets a revision every couple of years - except for 2022, when he was adapted thrice (mostly in bad films, except for the Del Toro one). The loveable puppet isn’t waiting too long for his next comeback, as the RPG Soulslike Lies Of P is coming to PC and Game Pass in August. \r\n\n\r\nLies Of P’s newest trailer is mostly a black screen with a lot of VO, but we get a clear look at Pinocchio's daddy Master Gepetto this time. The trailer follows a blob wobbling through very Victorian streets before it slides into some automation and uses the machine’s body as a puppet. The result is a boss-sized monstrosity that sits halfway between Lovecraftian horror and industrial defect. It also reminds me of Gears 5’s weird infected robots, with tentacles and slime hanging off their metallic arms - equally gross and cool.\r\n\n\r\nThe newest trailer doesn’t show off any Bloodborne-style combat, but we’ve had plenty of looks at that already, including a fight with a gorilla robocop. This Soulslike looks just as aggressive as you’d expect, emphasising quick dodge rolls and last-minute, anxiety-fueled parries. Pinocchio’s arm doubles up as a grappling hook to pull enemies in, which is always cool in a hack n’ slasher, and makes even more sense when you’re playing as a puppet. Also, is it just me or is Pinocchio pretty this time around?\r\n \nRead more",

Ozymandias is a bronze age 4X that builds momentum enough to turn that into \"just one more game\". It is incredibly easy to learn, and despite looking a little dry and number heavy, becomes more effortless, more pleasant the longer you play. It also becomes more clear how much depth there is hidden away in such a light design. It's about proving yourself the most prestigious civilisation, not through total conquest, but by exploiting the lay of the land, and leaning into your strengths.\nRead more",

Unlike some games, Veil Of Dust doesn't make it sound like any sort of concession; the middle difficulty is called Challenge, and says \"it's pretty tough - you've been warned\". I took the warning seriously, and thank God, because even the easiest difficulty had me pouring dandelion tea down my brother's throat like he was doing a kegstand (and in the game).\nÁine and Shane are a pair of Irish siblings who've moved to Oregon to start a new life, which, in the main story, involves eating potatoes and trying not to get depressed. It's difficult enough that I didn't think I would like it at first, as even basic tasks deplete your stamina and sleeping in your 1860s hovel with a hole in the roof doesn't restore very much per night. Áine can do spells, but they're simple and only really take the edge off what is a very hard life. Magic isn't a cure-all in Veil Of Dust, and using it has to be weighed up, just like everything else.\nRead more",

I can barely see three feet in front of my nose because of the thick blanket of fog, but I'm trying my hand at night fishing, hoping to hook something really good. I find a squid spot and start to fish, reeling in one or two fine-looking catches. The third one, however, is monstrous, a mess of jagged teeth and sickly pale flesh. Yes, this should make for a fine amount of cash. The more morbid it is, the more money I get. Suddenly there’s a deep rumbling in the ocean and panic starts to creep in. I chuck my prize into my cargo and speed back to town, the phrase ‘fuck round, find out’ circling my brain.\nI’ve not been playing Dredge long, but I’m calling it one of my favourite games of the year, right now, in February. Black Salt Games' sinister fishing RPG is gripping and enchanting in a way I didn’t anticipate. I’ve spent hours exploring its murky waters and my constant shock at what unsettling creatures my hook brings in is seemingly never-ending. Its eldritch world keeps pulling me back with its mystery and malevolent horror, and its sense of atmosphere and tension is incredible. Basically, I'm completely enraptured, hook, line, sinker. Dredge already feels like one of this year’s greatest indie horrors and all this, from a fishing game of all things.\nRead more",

Obsidian design director Josh Sawyer told me all about how the team revived long-dead historical fonts, to give them a new life in a modern format.\r\n\n \nRead more",

But that’s the fate of deep-space astronaut Selene in Returnal, when she ditches her single-seater vessel on a remote rock called Atropos. Each time she falls foul of the local fauna, she pops back into existence right next to her broken ship, with no obvious means of escape. Forget Aliens vs Predator, this is Aliens vs Groundhog Day.\nBut what a day it is, as Returnal combines a best-in-class third-person shooter with a deep dive into the psychology of its protagonist. Selene’s journey into Atropos, through a thick jungle, a burning vermilion desert and beyond, sends her circling through a smorgasbord of emotions – from confusion to hope, despair to determination. And so often, her mood dovetails with your own highs and lows of elation and frustration, until every part of Returnal encases you in its loop.\nRead more",

It was one of that era's City Building series that included Zeus and all of the Caesars, a run of games so good that they earned the capital letters. Pharaoh also happens to be one of my foundational video games, and I played it when I was knee-high to my big brother's desk, at a time when family homes had one (1) yellow-grey computer with a CRT screen. And now it's back, baby.\nPharaoh: A New Era means I can play that game of my childhood on my shiny black RGB-lit bastard. Honestly though, the \"A New Era\" part is a bit much. Sure, the updated graphics are fabulous and the quality of life changes mean it plays like smooth peanut butter to the 90s' extra crunchy. It's a good remake of a solid game, but the mummy in the casket is fundamentally the same.\nRead more",

These drives are hard to go back to after you're used to SSDs, with their near-instant access times, completely silent operation, resistance to shocks, drops and magnets and of course their overall SPEED. \nSo when I had the chance, I bought the biggest SSD I could afford, a 4TB model at the time, and copied literally every bit of data from the four or five 1TB or smaller hard drives that I'd bought over the years and stuck into my increasingly full PC tower. It was expensive, and it took ages to copy everything across, but as soon as I turned my computer on for the first time and I didn't have to listen to the clicks and whirs of a mechanical drive, I was completely convinced I'd made the right call to ditch spinning rust.  \nRead more",

In fairness, though, co-op adventure Blanc looks like it's going to be a lot lighter than games like Endling: Extinction is Forever and the notoriously upsetting Shelter series at first glance, but I’ve learned to never let my guard down around these kinds of games. Those cute art styles are almost always a front for a brutal sneak attack on your emotions.\nBlanc is very much aiming for your heartstrings with its adorable animal duo and picturesque snowy landscapes. The first half teases massive potential for a cutesy story with fun puzzle antics, but the game is majorly let down by a repetitive and often frustrating second half and lacklustre ending. After the promise of a warm, cosy adventure, I watched the end credits roll and couldn't help feeling like I'd been left out in the cold.\nRead more",

And I'm guessing it wants players to experience the joys of shredding goons, and a story told through unpredictable cuts to karaoke and anime. I'm sad to report that it isn't any of these things. Aside from the tiniest glimpses of cool when a combo comes together, the game clearly doesn't know what it wants to be, or if it did once upon a time, its original vision must've gotten lost under a dogpile of ideas. I rooted for it when I first saw it way back when, and got excited when I heard it was being made by devs behind Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive, but what's arrived is a jumbled mess that fights you at every turn. If I were Debra Meadon playing it for the first time live on Dragon's Den, and someone sidled up behind me and pressed a katana to my throat, I would still carefully put the controller down and say, \"It's a no from me\".\nRead more",

And, since an Ordinary (non-magical person) suddenly getting magic is also deemed weird in Ikenfell, it stands to reason that it’s practically guaranteed to happen. We can only assume the odds become even higher as the Ordinary ventures closer to the big magical fantasy school, which protagonist Maritte quickly discovers. Upon approaching the gate in search of her missing sister, Safina, Maritte suddenly starts to sling fiery spells.\nThose new spells certainly come in handy, as Maritte finds herself fired up (hehe, geddit?) and ready to fight through this Paper Mario-style tactical RPG. Along with some of Saf’s old friends, you explore the titular school and surrounding areas, searching for clues that might help unravel the mystery. Ikenfell has challenging combat and lots of little secrets hidden in its 8-bit world, but it’s the loveable bunch of pals (both allies and rivals) that really made me smile. Oh, and some of them have killer theme tunes that I can’t stop singing.\nRead more",

Where's the real magic? Where are the cataclysmic spells that take days or weeks of preparation, and then change the world with a single fateful ritual?\nThese games could learn something from The Last Spell, a roguelite turn-based tactics game about defending your village each night from hordes of mutant beasts that emerge from the purple fog surrounding the entire world.

          "description": "Have you ever planned to do a bunch of personally improving stuff on a Sunday morning like go for a walk down to the old pier or read 30 pages of an extremely political sci-fi book about aliens made of wool, but what you do instead is sit on the sofa playing an aggressively monetised mobile game while repeats of Modern Family run on the TV? For six hours, you do this, and eat your dinner feeling sick with unrealised potential.\nMatch-3 games are compulsive for a reason, and I don't have beef with them as a concept. I actually like them! But I don't like that to play a match-3 game I usually have to play a mobile game that wants me to spent money on Fairy Dollars so I can buy barrels of Explosive Wand Dust, making it easier to earn stars and incrementally furnish the Magic Toilet Goblin's bedroom, or whatever. It's the empty consumerism vibe of freemium mobile games that makes me feel like I've been eating the time-spending equivalent of junk food. Spirit Swap, which has a demo out now in the form of an endless mode, isn't that. It's beautiful, difficult, customiseable, and it'll swallow you time in a good way, not a faintly unsettling one.\nRead more",

Most of its parts are made to a high standard, it's tragic that its final design just doesn't work at all.\nOf all things, IOT reminds me of Fragile Allegiance. You're a 'founder', sent to an already colonised and abandoned Titan to build a new city at the behest of the Council. You're a 'founder', sent to an already colonised and abandoned Titan to build a new city at the behest of the Council. First, by salvaging its ruined buildings for minerals and isotopes, then mining for surface deposits, all of which goes back into your building resources. Curiously, you never combine two resources to produce a third, you can only upgrade minerals through a tier system. Higher tier resources are more potent, meaning, for exmaple, a building site will accept 100 raw minerals or four higher tier units. It’s a bit strange, but it mostly works. Double clicking on your starting buildings summons an interior view, where you lay out machinery, little modules for workers and storage, power pylons and so on.\nRead more",

          "description": "Vampiric survival game V Rising continues its early access with a free expansion coming in May. It's meaty, overhauling a few areas of the game including magic progression, spellcasting, and lair building in preparation for the endgame. But it’s also “giving you more of what you already love” with new weapons and spells, boss battles, areas, and factions. Quite a lot to sink your teeth into, then.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Start at the beginning, right? When faced with a self-imposed task as massive and daunting as writing a retrospective on The Sims franchise, going back to the very first game was the obvious launchpad. The original The Sims — now sometimes called The Sims 1 for the sake of clarity — was released in February 2000, and received regular updates via expansion packs through to October 2003. The game was the brainchild of Will Wright, the designer behind the SimCity series, who had decided to approach the world of his popular city-building franchise from a new angle. Switching from macro- to micro-management, Wright's new spin-off project aimed to focus on the architectural design of individual houses. As time went on, his creative interests would shift again, to also take in the lives of the people inside the buildings.\nRead more",

There's your chill little potion brewers that let you coo over a bubbling cauldron all nice and cosy like; there's your darker, more supernatural witchy adventures that dig into the spookier side of the fae realm, and then you've got your lovely genre mash-ups that add spicy, magical seasoning to well-worn action tropes, like the excellent bullet-hell Metroid-like The Knight Witch I wrote about the other day. But if I thought that was pushing against my limits of gamepad dexterity, Contingent99's 2018 roguelike Wizard Of Legend is on another level entirely.\nRead more",

All character classes are available to play up to a level cap of 25, and most of the main quests and side objectives will be included in the beta. It sounds similar to the beta test for Diablo III, which was held back in the spring of 2012 and offered up the same experience and limitations.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nhu26227MD4&ab_channel=Diablo\nPlayers who pre-order Diablo IV will receive early access to the beta for the weekend of March 17-19. The beta will be fully opened up to the public on the following weekend, March 24-26. Progress from the closed beta will carry through to the open beta. You can check out full details on what to expect from this trial over on the official Blizzard website.

Appropriately taking place after the world has spent the aforementioned nine years in darkness, you play as Europa, who refuses to let that timespan build into a full decade. Bringing with her a “healing teddy bear,” she sets off to the cursed Castle Talos to try and bring color back into the world.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/XIm-ss9L3pA[/embed]\nMusic will play an important role in the narrative. Some bosses wield “musical attack patterns.” Serving as guest composers are Metal Gear Solid veteran Norihiko Hibino and Iga-era Castlevania fixture Michiru Yamane. On top of contributing to the soundtrack of 9 Years of Shadows, these two absolute legends will make appearances within the game as NPCs. Damn.\nThe Symphony of the Night corner of the indie marketplace is a rather crowded one these days, but I’m rather stricken by the colorful pixel art that 9 Years of Shadow is showing off. It reminds me of the way Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance used bright colors to appear more visible on the Game Boy Advance’s light-hungry screen. I sometimes feel like I’ve had my fill of gated exploration titles, but they more often resemble pickles; I always seem to have room for one more.\n9 Years of Shadows will be available on PC via Steam and Epic Game Store on March 27. A Switch version is in the works and will drop in the third quarter of 2023.\nThe post 9 Years of Shadows envelopes March 27 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Even if these rankings are subjective, deciding which games are “best” wracks my brain for hours before I finish a rough draft. This is why I do not say lightly that all my lists to this point pale in comparison to the difficulty of ranking the best SNES games.\nLord Spencer elegantly described my 10 best Mario games list as “a list of nines rolling into tens.” As I jotted down my picks for this list, I realized they were all potentially tens. The SNES is so jam-packed with incredible titles that we upped the count to 15 to represent it. This is a system where legends were born, franchises were codified, and memories were made magical.

Essentially a futuristic version of the golden age Atari game, Combat, Grobda sees players control the titular tank against a battalion of enemies in top-down, maze-driven action. The player must utilize the Grobda's laser weaponry to destroy their opponents while dodging return fire across a gauntlet of 99 stages.\nCheck out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Old Classic Retro Gaming.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAXdlXLPlRQ&ab_channel=OldClassicRetroGaming\nHaving launched just on the verge of the Video Game Crash, Grobda would swiftly vanish into the void, though home versions were developed for Japanese platforms such as the Sharp X1 and the NEC PC-6001. Grobda development team featured some notable Namco luminaries, including Tower of Druaga designer Masanobu Endo, and Dig Dug composer Yuriko Keino. Always a pioneer, Keino devised a mechanic that allowed Grobda to speed up her score as the action heated up, a fun little gimmick for the time. Development was smashed out in a mere three months from conception to release. Wild days.\nGrobda is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nThe post Namco’s obscure tank battler Grobda rolls into the Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

Pomelo Games' builder is dropping on March 7, 2023.\nFirst released on the iOS Apple Arcade in 2019, Outlanders is a survival town-builder, a genre that has been growing in popularity since Shining Rock Software’s 2014 hit, Banished. Since then, the formula has been expanded by games like Frostpunk and Settlement Survival. The focus of these games is on resource management, as your townsfolk suffer from a fatal condition known as mortality. Fail to keep them fed and healthy, and they will succumb to their diseases.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/HGWqZ6mp-lo[/embed]\nOutlanders attempts a more relaxed approach, but you’ll still be tasked with filling hungry bellies. It has a narrative campaign that has you follow the paths of various leaders. There is no combat, but the media around it shows construction near a volcano. Like other games in the series, you manage the workload of the town’s inhabitants, and you can pass decrees to work the ungrateful peons to an early grave. Improvements have been made to the UI and graphics to make it better suited to the good old mouse and keyboard setup. A sandbox mode will also be available if you do better without having to worry about goals or expectations.\nOutlanders is currently available on iOS via Apple Arcade, and will be coming to PC on March 7, 2023. There is currently a PC demo available on Steam if you want to kick the tires.\nThe post Outlanders lays its foundations on PC March 7 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The gameplay in Duskers is two-fold, with players tasked with maintaining, upgrading, and micro-managing their drone units, before taking them out into the field, where they are controlled with rudimentary commands in a very \"classic sci-fi\" manner.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dux33m_7M6w&ab_channel=MisfitsAttic\nIt is the players' duty to maintain the drones' well-being, both on and off the field. This includes helping them to negotiate environmental hazards, avoid malfunctions and fuel loss, and ensure that the drones are kept routinely repaired and ready to rock from sector to sector. It's all very Silent Running, from a technical and aesthetic standpoint — Though I do not think Duskers features any actual gardening. Duskers would be critically acclaimed for its design and atmosphere on launch, even bagging several independent game awards and nominations.\nDuskers will be able to download from Epic Games Store from February 23 until March 2. Until then, players still have the opportunity to bag current freebie Warpips, before its removal on Wednesday.\nThe post Lo-fi sci-fi title Duskers is next week’s Epic Games Store freebie appeared first on Destructoid.",

Grenier heads up a team of over 10 individuals, all of whom have taken their leave of Respawn within the past two years. These include CEO Dusty Welch, project lead Mohammad Alvali, engineer Justin Cook, lead designer Carlos Pineda, project manager Amelia Duarte, and art director Robert Taube.\nhttps://twitter.com/ChadGrenier/status/1626271511748435974?s=20\nCurrently working in a remote capacity, Wildlight Entertainment has physical offices established in both Los Angeles and Seattle, and is already hard at work on its first title: a brand new, yet-to-be-revealed IP. While the pertinent details are on the hush-hush, one can only assume that the team behind Apex Legends, Call of Duty, and Titanfall will be looking to deliver a highly polished action title, perhaps with a similarly sci-fi/futuristic slant.\nYou can read more on the company and its team over on the new Wildlight Entertainment website, or follow the studio on Twitter for updates, job vacancies, and more news and info. For action/shooter fans, this will definitely be one of the developers to watch in 2024 and beyond.\nThe post Wildlight Entertainment is a new studio founded by ex-Titanfall, Apex Legends devs appeared first on Destructoid.",

But if the wait's just a bit too long, there's a demo for Ishin out today so you can get a taste of the new-old combat.\nThe \"Combat Demo\" is out now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The two-part combat demo covers a roughly 20-minute section of the game, specifically spotlighting the combat of Like a Dragon: Ishin, which sees Ryoma bringing his sword, gun, and fists to bear against foes.\nThe slice of Ishin covers both a brawl at Kiyomizu temple and a face-off with some armored foes. This demo looks to spotlight not just the fighting, but what enemies are bringing to the table to try and stop Ryoma. If he's anything like his supposed descendant, though, there's not much that can.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqkDNGqWrvE\nSega and RGG Studio have also revealed a special \"Dragon of Dojima\" skin, that will make Sakamoto Ryoma look just like Kazuma Kiryu, suit and all.\nHeading back to an older era\nIshin is a remake of the earlier entry in the series, one which we never saw ported over to the west. It's historical fiction, using the likenesses of many Like a Dragon series characters, but with different names, playing figures from the time in dramatized versions of the events.\nStill, just because Kiryu is actually Ryoma, doesn't mean there isn't some classic Like a Dragon to get up to. Alongside the brawling you can see in the Ishin combat demo, there's also the usual substories and side-games you'd expect from the series. Plus, an Another Life section where Ryoma can live it up as a peaceful farmer. What's not to like about a slice of farming life inside this classically action-heavy series?\nLike a Dragon: Ishin! goes live on Feburary 17 for Deluxe Digital pre-orders, and on February 21 for every other version.\nThe post Like a Dragon: Ishin! demo lets you get a taste of battle before launch appeared first on Destructoid.",

Initially, they had planned for the game to be out the door by February or March, but now they’re predicting it could land as late as April.\nFrogwares has released a video to go along with the announcement to outline the difficulties they have been having. The developer is based out of Kyiv, Ukraine, and because of the Russian invasion targeting the country’s energy infrastructure, the team has had trouble maintaining a work schedule. The video also outlines how some members have to alternate working remotely and in office, depending on which site has power at the time.\nhttps://youtu.be/d5XiUNnjp-4\nWhile I haven’t played any of Frogwares’ Sherlock Holmes titles, I have gotten into The Sinking City, which I mostly enjoy. I’m mostly held back by the fact that I’ve never read any of the novels. Frogwares started their adventure series based off Arthur Conan Doyle’s detective stories back in 2001. Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened is a full remake of their third game, released back in 2007. They’ve been at it for a long time, and the series has gained its share of fans.\nFrogwares isn’t the only developer trying to put together a game during an invasion. Much of Digital Dreams Entertainment, developers of Mutant Football League, are trying to create a sequel to their Football title. Likewise, GSC Gameworld is still pushing toward a release for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl, and has already had to delay it for the same reason.\nSherlock Holmes: The Awakened will be coming to PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch sometime in March or April.\n \nThe post Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened has been pushed back a few weeks appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Revenge is a dish best served all the time\n34BigThings has announced that it's dropping its loose interactive adaptation of Roberto Saviano’s novel Gomorrah today. The plot seems unconnected with either the book or the 2014 Italian TV show of the same name, instead utilizing a similar crime drama approach to the narrative.\nIn Gomorrah, you take the role Nina Miniero, the daughter of a Naplese crime boss. After Nina’s 18th birthday party is attacked and her father murdered, she takes the reins of the crime family and drives it on a collision course with revenge. You lead the family through various procedurally created missions, making each playthrough different. There are eight possible endings that you’ll reach based on your choices.\nGomorrah is presented largely as a choice-driven visual novel with visuals crafted by comic artist Luca Negri. Gameplay is largely resource management and decision-making. The team has stated that they weren’t able to work with author Roberto Saviano himself, but a screenwriter from the TV series provided some guidance.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/rRHQ_at02r4[/embed]\nI really enjoy the visual style of this game, and it sounds like an interesting experience. Something about it is giving me pause, however. I definitely don’t mind more menu-heavy gameplay, but it might just be that I’m not that big into violent crime drama. I’m familiar with neither the book nor the TV show. Still, at release, Gomorrah will run for $3, so it’s not a big investment if you want to take a peek.\nGomorrah is available today on PC, iOS, and Android.\nThe post Interactive narrative Gomorrah launches on PC and Mobile today appeared first on Destructoid.",

A full remake of the 2014 spin-off title in the Yakuza/Like a Dragon series of action-RPGS — And speaking of yesteryear, the studios announced that a special DLC skin is included in Ishin's Deluxe Edition, which sees the return of the eponymous Like a Dragon protagonist, Kazuma Kiryu!\nThe \"Dragon of Dojima\" DLC will allow players to dress Ishin's hero like his centuries-later descendant, complete with his iconic silver-grey suit and snakeskin shoes. It should be noted that this is just an aesthetic skin, Sakamoto will not literally become Kazuma — But if you fancied turning the attractive, period-piece world of Edo Japan into an absolutely dreadful anachronism, then you're sorted.\nIn this short trailer, you can see Sakamoto looking slick as he gets his ears cleaned out.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqkDNGqWrvE&ab_channel=SEGA\nLike a Dragon: Ishin! is a full remake of the 2014 PS3 release of the same name, and follows the adventures of Ryoma Sakamoto, who becomes embroiled in a local war of houses while investigating the murder of his sensei. Like a Dragon: Ishin! continues the hard-boiled drama, violent action, and a little of the tongue-in-cheek nature that is the trademark of the Like a Dragon series, but never saw the light of day outside of Japan, with Sega concerned that the game's setting and characters might not localize well enough to warrant the effort .\nOne should remember that the series then was not the highly recognized brand that it has become today, specifically since the launch of 2015's Yakuza 0, which was a huge hit on the PS4 platform.\nLike a Dragon: Ishin! launches February 21 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post Kazuma Kiryu DLC skin included in Like a Dragon: Ishin!

Playing as cute-as-heck aspiring chef, Pom, you will plumb the dark recesses of the world for ingredients to serve to your customers. You’ll weaponize your utensils to take on bigger, badder bosses in an effort to build the best recipes for your discerning customers.\nI’m sorry, I’m a bit distracted here. I keep looking at the food.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/vSxgdxR1_5s[/embed]\nBeyond ingredients, dungeon diving will net you gold, items, and additional recipes. The dungeons are procedurally assembled, giving you something new each time you plumb them. As you gather wealth and renown, you’ll expand your restaurant so you can serve more customers and thereby gather even more wealth and renown.\nThis is cute. This reminds me of 2010’s Recettear in its combination of dungeon diving and business management. The gameplay loop of setting out into the world and returning to reap the rewards is an addicting one. Better yet, I’m enamored by the graphics. Not just the food, but just the bright colorfulness of its all, its chibi characters, and the pleasant-looking towns. Also, the food. I’m not hungry right now, but the way the highlights are drawn on those meals makes me want to eat and deal with the consequences later.\nCuisineer will be coming to PC in Summer, 2023.\nThe post Cuisineer is simmering for a Summer 2023 release appeared first on Destructoid.",

The trailer then showcases how Taron Egerton's character is deadset on bringing Tetris to everybody after playing it once.

The original PlayStation VR, from the outside at least, seemed like a moderate success for Sony. It was a functional VR alternative for players who were not interested in entering the world of PC gaming and it had at least one undeniable, exclusive hit with Astro Bot Rescue Mission.\nPlayStation VR2 is the next logical step for the sub-platform. It works with Sony’s latest hardware, it improves on basically every aspect of PlayStation VR, but it’s not quite the virtual reality revolution I feel like we’ve been waiting for since the advent of the medium.\nThe Setup\nEvery virtual realit…",

Two of these titles, Song of Nunu and Convergence, had been previously announced, while the third game, The Mageseeker, makes it debut. \n\n\nThe Mageseeker is set to arrive first sometime this spring. Developed by Digital Sun, the team behind Moonlighter, it’s described as a gritty 2D action RPG. It stars Sylas and takes place in Demacia. You can find The Mageseeker on PC and unspecified consoles. \nConvergence launches this summer and was first revealed at The Game Awards in 2019. Starring Ekko, it’s a 2D action-platforming adventure by Double Stallion that features parkour and time-manipulation mechanics. Convergence launches for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam and Epic. \nSong of Nunu closes out the year. Releasing this fall, it centers on the young Nunu and his yeti partner Willump on a search to find Nunu’s mother. The charming adventure game focuses on the pair working together to solve environmental puzzles. Song of Nunu comes from the folks at Tequila Works, the developer of titles such as Rime and Gylt, and it will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam and Epic. \nRiot released its first League of Legends spin-off Ruined King in 2021 to generally positive reviews, so we're curious to see how these other projects fair and if they'll attract new, non-MOBA fans coming off Netflix's well-received Arcane series. Which League of Legends title are you most interested in?

Movie to the next level by launching a website and commercial promoting the brothers’ New York City plumbing business, and it's actually pretty cool. \nYou can visit the website here, which features a commercial promoting the Mario Bros. business. Older fans will likely recognize the catchy jingle as the theme song of the 1989 Super Mario Brothers Super Show, which is a nice homage. \n\n\nThe website also features humorous testimonials, job opportunities, and even a working phone number. Calling this number (929-55-MARIO) plays a recorded message by the Charlie Day-voiced Luigi, which provides a nice sample of his performance as the green-glad sidekick. Texting the number returns a message, which, depending on when you sent it, may return a digital poster for the movie. GI editor Kyle Hilliard got this Toad poster when he texted the number yesterday:\nIn my case, I only got a message thanking me for my interest in Super Mario Bros. Plumbing with a link to a form submission on the website. I'm not sure what you get for submitting this form, but feel free to find out yourselves. \nThe Super Mario Bros.

I liked what I saw in the initial trailer, sure, but what I found especially intriguing was that most of the game happens through a first-person view of someone driving an old station wagon through a beautiful but distraught Pacific Northwest forest. Rarely do driving games force a first-person view, and even fewer deviate from being a racer. \nPacific Drive does both, and after viewing roughly 30 minutes of gameplay during a virtual preview, I’m even more intrigued.

During today's Nintendo Direct, we got a new look at gameplay, plus the announcement of the Collector's Edition and a new Amiibo figure starring Link. However, we also got some unfortunate news surrounding the upcoming launch of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.\nIn its press release for the Nintendo Direct, Nintendo announced that the upcoming Zelda entry will retail for $69.99. This makes Nintendo the latest major publish to test the waters of raising the price of its triple-A titles in recent years. This follows other major publishers like 2K Games and PlayStation, who started pricing their major releases at $70 with the start of the new console generation in 2020. Last year, both Xbox and Ubisoft announced that their triple-A games would cost $70 going forward.\nWe reached out to Nintendo for comment regarding the reasoning for the price increase and if this will be the trend for its triple-A releases going forward, but did not immediately receive a response. We will update this story if Nintendo provides a statement.\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom launches on Switch on May 12.",

This follow-up game to The Messenger is set in the same universe, but set many years prior to the team’s first game, and with an entirely different style and genre, recalling the early era of console RPGs, represented by games like Final Fantasy VI. \nSea of Stars features some stunning pixel art visuals, and also boasts guest musical compositions from Yasunori Mitsuda, whose music enhanced such games as Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross, and Xenoblade Chronicles 3.\nThe new trailer helps to show off the wide variety of locales players visit in the game, along with some intriguing turn-based battles.\nSea of Stars increasingly looks like a major treat for anyone who has fond recollections of that golden age of early console RPGs.\nThe game is headed to Switch on August 29, and a free demo is available later today on the Nintendo eShop.\nCheck out the new trailer below.",

It will be available physically on February 22.\nThe trailer for the remaster showed off the improved visuals and also noted that the game will be playable with the modern, dual control stick first-person controls. If, however, you would like to play it as originally intended, that will be an option. Nintendo is promising additional control options, as well.\nThe trailer also reminded that the game takes place on Talon IV, and focuses on using various visors to make progress.",

There’s also a cute dog-like creature that seems to ally with the player to smash through barriers, act as a mount, and other as-yet unrevealed capabilities.\nNintendo also appeared to reveal a release date for Pikmin 4, flashing up the date of July 21, 2023.

Alongside fellow director Kazunori Kadoi, their team has taken on the lofty task of reinventing the 2005 classic for a modern audience, recapturing the game's magic while also expanding it with new features. During our cover story interview with the two designers, they spoke candidly about the early phases of the game's development, their initial hesitation to tackle such an intimidating project, and how the team's approach in identifying areas for improvement gave them the confidence to see the project through. \nAmpo and Kadoi have plenty of experience working on Resident Evil.

There's no release date for the patch, nor does the message elaborate on the specifics of these improvements. \n“We are committed to making Forspoken the most enjoyable experience possible, and will provide an update about the timing of the next patch as soon as possible,” says Aramaki in the statement, which you can read in full below (click the image to enlarge). \nForspoken earned a 7.5 out of 10 review score from Game Informer, with editor Kyle Hilliard writing, “Forspoken's story and combat fail to reach the heights of its movement and exploration, but thankfully those two latter elements make up most of the experience. I sprinted, often literally, through the campaign in about 15 hours, and now I have a large world filled with nooks and crannies I'm eager to run through and explore. The narrative won’t linger with me, and I avoided combat in the open world often, but I loved making Frey leap and fly through Athia to discover all its treasure chests and secrets.” Check out our full review here.",

          "description": "To many, Cities: Skylines is the premier city-building simulation. When the PC launched in 2015, it quickly became a fan-favorite release for those who felt let down by modern SimCity titles. When the sim title arrived on consoles two years later, the less-intuitive controls didn't detract too much from the experience, enabling it to still deliver a terrific city-building experience. Now, developer Colossal Order and publisher Paradox Interview have announced Cities: Skylines Remastered, which improves the experience for console players in myriad ways.\nThis new version of Cities: Skylines aims to let players create bigger and better metropolises than ever before. In addition to the obvious graphical and performance upgrades enabled by the newer hardware, players can take their city-planning skills to the next level with up to 25 buildable tiles instead the 9 on PS4 and Xbox One versions. Additionally, players can look forward to a quick-selection tool, user-experience improvements like precision placements and updated snapping options, a new environmental control panel, a map editor, and the ability to place structures freely.\nPerhaps most importantly, anyone who owns the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One version and its DLC will receive Cities: Skylines Remastered and DLC (up to the Airports expansion) for free on their respective console family. Those who don't already own the last-gen console version can grab Cities: Skylines Remastered for $40.\nYou can see a very brief teaser rattling off some of the improvements the team made for this new version below.\n\n\nCities: Skylines Remastered arrives on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on February 15. The remastered versions of the DLC will become available in the coming months. For more on Cities: Skylines, read our 2015 review of the PC version here and the 2017 console version here. You can also read our 2021 interview with the CEO of Colossal Order on the enduring success of Cities: Skylines here.",

          "description": "A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.6.1. It's time to prepare for a new release!\nOur lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:\nSoldier Boyz\nGLK Scott Adams Interactive Fiction games (C64 and ZX Spectrum)\nGLK Scott Adams adventures 1-12 (TI99/4A format)\nObsidian\nPink Panther: Passport to Peril\nPink Panther: Hokus Pokus Pink\nDriller/Space Station Oblivion\nHalls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II\nBesides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list. Maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long - otherwise, there are some demos of these games available on our website.\nAnd since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen notable changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.\nAs usual, we are not just adding support for new games. We are constantly working on improving the engines we already support and, in particular, we’ve seen some incredible work being done on the SCUMM engine. Yes, there are the usual bug fixes, but this time we are also adding a feature that helps playing the SCUMM games in a truly original fashion: Support for the original loading and saving dialogs within the GUI!\nSpeaking of truly original: Remember those old CRT displays we had back in the day? With ScummVM 2.7.0 you’ll be able to replicate this experience on certain platforms thanks to our new shader-based scalers. Go ahead and give it a try!\nAll testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.\nA detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.\nThank you very much for your support! Let’s make ScummVM 2.7.0 a great release - together!\n>",

Depending on your perspective, we’re either two months early for our usual April 1st release, or a bit tardy for the Christmas 2022 release we intended. We think the wait has been worth it. This is one of the largest releases we’ve done in several years, with numerous features and improvements covering the user interface, gameplay features, and modding extensions for NewGRF and Game Script creators. Some of the highlights are: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. This includes better automatic scaling when using HiDPI or mixed DPI setups. Direct access to NewGRF/AI/GS settings from the new game window. Various small tweaks and improvements to several windows. NewGRFs can now provide engine variants that are shown hierarchically in the purchase list. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. Custom league tables for GameScripts. More natural rivers which get wider as they flow downstream. And much more, which can be seen in the changelog or the previous release announcements! In addition to these features and improvements, we’ve fixed lots of bugs. (If you played with the RC2 testing release, most were fixed before then. See the changelog for full details.)
