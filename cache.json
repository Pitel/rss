          "description": "Pull my (Trinity) Trigger.\nFans of '90s JRPGs, particularly those released for the SNES, will have been watching Trinity Trigger closely. The game boasts a veritable dream team from some of the best JRPGs of the past 30 years, including those who worked on Xenoblade Chronicles, Octopath Traveler, and, of course, Secret of Mana. There is a lot for Trinity Trigger to live up to; fortunately, it managed to exceed our expectations in most areas.\nThe world of Trinitia is at the centre of an unending war between the Gods of Order and the Gods of Chaos. To prevent destroying everything in their conflict, the gods agreed to choose a champion and have them fight in their stead, but not before several of their weapons, called Arma, were scattered along the surface. Giant spears, axes, and swords have become home to monsters and scavengers alike, while the gods wait to see whether the Warrior of Chaos or Order will prevail.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "And does Breath of the Wild fit the mould?\nDespite the overwhelmingly positive reception to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild when it launched back in 2017, there are undoubtedly those who yearn for a return to what they deem to be a more “traditional” Zelda experience. With its open world, shrines, weapon degradation, and ‘rune’ abilities, Breath of the Wild most certainly made some significant changes to the games that came prior, but we have to ask ourselves here: just what constitutes a “traditional” Zelda game, anyway?\nFrom a story perspective, Zelda games have always followed a pretty similar path: you play as a hero who must embark on a grand adventure to save the land and defeat evil. That’s always been the case, whether you’re talking about the original NES game, Ocarina of Time, or Breath of the Wild. Some titles, like Majora’s Mask or Link’s Awakening, might well feel different in how they approach their respective narratives, but those games still boil down to the same essentials.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Really, though, one of the best experiences you can have this Steam Puzzle Fest week is by downloading the free demo for upcoming puzzler Viewfinder. Developed by Sad Owl Studios, I had a sneaky peek at this at GDC last month and was properly blown away by it. It might look like just another Witness-like, but don't be fooled. There are some real smart ideas in here, and I dare you not to go 'OooOOOooooOOOooooh' when you see the in-game photos you take come to life in all their full, 3D explorable glory. \nRead more",

It's still very early in development (like there isn't even a Steam page for it yet), but it's still an incredible-sounding concept, as every time you start a new game, a random NPC will be selected to become a serial killer. You can grow crops, fish, raise cattle, and also help save your fellow townsfolk from a rampaging murderer. Cute!\nRead more",

          "description": "For all its flamingo thigh stews, misshapen clothes model characters and pizza-themed DJ-ing, Betrayal At Club Low is an old-school, dice-throwing RPG through and through. Every interaction you have at Club Low is determined by the rolling of dice, whether it's simply attempting to spark a conversation with a hard-of-hearing bartender, or bluffing your way into VIP backrooms where your blown fellow agent Gemini Jay is currently being grilled by the intimidating Big Mo. \nWhether you're successful in your endeavours depends on whether you can roll higher or equal to whatever value is thrown by your opponent, with each face corresponding to a particular Skill Dice you're trying to deploy to win that scenario. A lot of the time, your skill numbers aren't nearly good enough to beat your fellow clubber outright, but for me, the thrill of Club Low comes from clinching a very plain, and highly unremarkable draw, earning you the accolade of 'Success. Barely' in the ensuing results breakdown. It may not sound very sexy, but in a world where the odds are fully stacked against you, barely succeeding will do me just fine here, thanks.\nRead more",

Samantha, one among my ragged band of survivors, breaks down sobbing on the ground and I direct Maki, a veterinarian, to do something about it. She punches Samantha full-on in the face, knocking her unconscious (“Oh, I guess that’s what ‘knock out’ means,” I realize a moment too late). Well, at least I don’t have to worry about her running off into the woods or something. It’s a rough start, but they have no choice but to work together from here on out.\nFor fans of the survival simulation genre, crashlanding on an alien planet is a familiar premise, but it's one Stranded: Alien Dawn absolutely smashes. This game has been at the top of my to-be-played list for a while and now that it’s exiting early access for a full release, it’s safe to say that Stranded is the closest thing to my dream human vs nature survival game I’ve seen yet.\nRead more",

In it, I'll be discussing some common themes between multiple games, digging into underappreciated gems from years gone by... The remit is broad and nebulous, to the point where it's clearly obvious why I haven't been able to come up with a name for it yet.\r\n\n(If you end up thinking of something, please do let me know in the comments.

It's a genuine marvel how I'm able to lay on the couch and play Like A Dragon: Ishin, or stream Resident Evil 4 - with admittedly, a ropey success rate - to it from my PC in the other room. I've even been reunited with some old friends, too. Welcome back to the fold, Rogue Legacy 2.\nBut my time spent with the Deck has me thinking that my gaming priorities have changed. I'm no longer excited by consoles that promise better graphics or blazing fast loading speeds. At least, not for big boxes designed for living rooms. Right now, I'm far more excited by the practicality of handhelds and how they'll evolve. The Deck might be the future, but it's also brought me back to my past.\nRead more",

I wanted to see how well that smoothness and stability would carry over to the Steam Deck, and although the long-delayed zombie mulcher needs some cuts to quality settings, finding the right balance will have Dead Island 2 running almost as comfortably as the very best Steam Deck games.\nAlas, it’s still not the ideal handheld game, thanks both to the odd crash (lowering settings helps with this) and the fact that it needs some tinkering with the Epic Games Launcher to get it playable in the first place. Still, playable it very much is.\nLet’s start by addressing Dead Island 2’s lack of a Steam version; it launches on February 21st as an Epic Games exclusive, and since DI2 isn’t even listed on Steam right now, that’s unlikely to change any time soon. Luckily, there are workarounds: you can either install the Heroic Launcher, or follow our handy guide on how to install the Epic Games Launcher on the Steam Deck. Both of these should allow you to get Dead Island 2 downloaded onto the handheld, still using your regular Epic account.\n Read more",

          "description": "Back in the mists of time (January 2020), I was absolutely transfixed by a Japanese novel called Before The Coffee Gets Cold. It's about a small, cosy café where customers can travel back in time by sitting in a very particular chair, for the length of time it takes for a cup of coffee to go cold. It's not long by any means, but it affords its cast of regulars the chance to get some closure on an issue that's often been plaguing them throughout their lives. It's heart-warming, soppy stuff, but very feel-good. That January was also about the same time I slurped up every last episode of Midnight Diner on Netflix, where a chill Japanese man known only as The Master serves up delicious looking dishes in a tiny, 10-person izakaya from midnight onwards. Put these two things together, and it's probably no surprise that I liked the original Coffee Talk more than most.\nCoffee Talk Episode 2: Hibiscus & Butterfly is a continuation of that story, set three years later in the same, alternate version of Seattle where elves, werewolves, orcs, mermaids and other fantastical creatures all rub shoulders as city-dwelling citizens in need of a good cuppa. Once again, you play as the owner of the titular late-night coffee shop, brewing up a multitude of exotic hot drinks that you'll need to match to each customer's request that night as they tell you their woes. \nRead more",

          "description": "In the world of turn-based strategy games, it's probably fair to say that we've been waiting a heck of a long time for Jagged Alliance to make its next move. Almost a quarter of a century has passed since the last numbered entry in the series, and the many attempts that have been made to recapture its tactical, mercenary magic since then have been mixed at best, and reviled at worst. Haemimont Games, the devs behind Tropico and current custodians of the upcoming Jagged Alliance 3, know this, and their publisher THQ Nordic said as much back in September 2021 when it was first revealed, assuring players they were going to create a game that \"really does justice to the Jagged Alliance legacy\".  \nBut in an era where turn-based tactics games are now increasingly defined by genre titans such as XCOM and Into The Breach, I'm not sure that legacy means all that much anymore. I've been playing a substantial early chunk of Jagged Alliance 3 over the last week or so, and its decision to pare back crucial information such as chance-to-hit and other modern conveniences has mostly left me feeling frustrated and annoyed rather than daring and excited. The writing also made me cringe so hard at times I think even the neighbours heard my groans of despair. It certainly looks the part of a modern strategy game, its detailed African landscape, top down perspective and interactive objects calling to mind Mimimi's excellent Desperados 3 and Shadow Tactics games, but the rest feels like it's been lifted straight out of the late 90s where we last left Jagged Alliance 2 - and not necessarily to its benefit.\nRead more",

          "description": "To pre-empt your first question, no, Dead Island 2 was not worth waiting eleven years for. In its defence, however, few things are. If George Romero had taken over a decade to make Night Of The Living Dead, the fact it takes place largely in a basement would look less like canny guerrilla filmmaking and more like staggering incompetence. It only took NASA eight years to put men on the moon from the point they started trying, which puts the value of many inhibited projects (like my folder of unfinished novels) into depressingly sharp relief.\r\n\n\r\nDead Island 2 does not put zombies on the moon, though given how daft the main game is, don't rule out a Dead Island 2: Moon's Haunted expansion shambling your way in late 2023. Yet that doesn't mean it's a bad game. In fact, it's quite an enjoyable one. Together, Deep Silver and Dambuster Studios have raised a moderately entertaining sequel to Techland's ye olde zombie survival sim, one that injects some life into its desiccated subject matter by being incredibly shiny, wilfully silly, spectacularly gory, and generally a touch more imaginative than I expected.\r\n\n \nRead more",

A crashing issue with Life is Strange Remastered Collection has also been nixxed, as has a bug that for some reason forced open the Deck’s onscreen keyboard when launching A Plague Tale: Innocence and A Plague Tale: Requiem. Most of the other addressed problems don’t look as funny in my head, but you can read them all in the full patch notes regardless.\nDownloading Proton 8.0 onto the Steam Deck is easy enough: just search for it in your Library, tap or select the icon when it appears in the results, hit Install, and restart when it’s done. Begone, foul keyboards.\n Read more",

          "description": "When The Witcher Remake devs Fool's Theory and 11 bit studios announced their new RPG The Thaumaturge at the very end of February, I'll admit that the premise didn't immediately grab me. The announcement trailer was little more than an enigmatic pan through the streets of historic Warsaw, and its climactic reveal of a shadowy man performing some Naruto finger magic to conjure a Soulsian monster from the gloom made it seem like yet another supernatural yarn in the vein of Frogwares' The Sinking City and Cyanide's Call Of Cthulhu. The gameplay trailer (embedded below) that followed a few days later revealed a teeny glimmer of what its monster fights actually look like in the flesh, but I still wasn't quite convinced this supernatural tale of demon tamers and interdimensional rifts would end up doing enough to make it stand out. \nBut actually clapping eyes on it in person at GDC? The Thaumaturge had my full attention. Set in Warsaw in 1905 - a period where Poland didn't exist on any real-life map due to it being under occupation by Russia, Germany and Austria at the time - this dark fantasy RPG sees its titular paranormal 'miracle worker' delve deep into the city's political tensions, conducting isometric detective investigations that pull from Fool's Theory's support work on Larian's Divinity: Original Sin games, while also engaging in striking turn-based battles to root out the corruption plaguing its citizens. Plus, with its hard lean into Slavic, rather than Lovecraftian, folklore for its ungodly ghoulies, The Thaumaturge has shot right to the top of my 'keep an eye on this maybe surprise hit' list. \nRead more",

Microsoft’s DirectStorage has only so far only found support in the ho-hum Forspoken, and PCIe 5.0 SSDs still aren’t widely available despite the first compatible CPUs and motherboards launching in 2021.\nHowever, the latter are coming soon, and I’ve been testing out an engineering sample of the Crucial T700 to see how PCIe 5.0 – also known as PCIe Gen5 – drives could perform in an honest-to-goodness gaming PC. The short version: with maximum read and write speeds that tower over the current generation’s best SSDs, albeit with less impact on game load times than such explosive pace would suggest.\nRead more",

They'll zomble their way up the main path, and with their high health pools they'll cut into the vast piglin forces and buy me time. With another flourish a contingent of friendly creepers scuttles along behind me. I lead them on a flanking attack around the outpost, targeting their spawners while the main piglin army is occupied with my frontal assault. A masterpiece of tactical engineering!\nOr it would have been, if my minions weren't so bloody stupid. Half my zombies fell off the staircase they were climbing due to their terrible pathfinding, and burned up in the lava moat below. Meanwhile, I sent my creepers off to explode against the first spawner I found. Only one of them got there; the others relentlessly humped a wall they could easily have climbed, until Piglins surrounded and slaughtered them. I returned to my starting point with what remained of my army, a fair bit poorer in resources, and a great deal poorer in patience.\nWelcome to Minecraft Legends, a strange mixture of real-time strategy and open-world adventure which frustrates and impresses in equal measure. There's half a great game lurking here, but it's marred by inadequacies that have nibbled away at me like piglins at my walls. This game could have been so much more.\nRead more",

More than anything, I was impressed at just how good we have it in the multiplayer FPS genre at the moment. Apex Legends, Warzone 2, Overwatch 2, Valorant, Rainbow Six Siege. That's some unbelievably tough competition. XDefiant has to either give players something completely different, or absolutely nail the basics. It's opted for the second path, and having played several matches against a medley of press people and content creators, I'm not convinced Ubisoft's new arena shooter is up to the challenge.\nRead more",

Ne-konference neznamená, že se organizátorům nechce připravovat program, ale naopak dává prostor všem pozvaným, aby si program sami složili z toho nejzajímavějšího, čím se v poslední době zabývají nebo co je oslovilo. Obsah, který vytváří všichni účastníci, se skládá z desetiminutových prezentací a delších workshopů s převážně vývojářskou tematikou od devops, přes datové struktury, nástroje, jazyky, zkušenosti s automatizací testů a různé zajímavosti ze světa IT. Co je potřeba udělat, abyste se mohli zúčastnit? Připravit si desetiminutovou prezentaci na libovolné téma, která má potenciál oslovit ostatní přítomné. Historicky proběhlo i několik velmi zajímavých nevývojářských témat, takže ani výletu do úplně jiného oboru není třeba se nikterak bránit.",

This actually marks its first official release in the west, years later, and it's got a new visual style and layout to go with it.\nMuch like the original Portopia, this new version is also a text-parser adventure.

That’s mostly because it’s essentially an apology for Castlevania 64. Love it or hate it, it’s hard to deny that Castlevania 64 had the signs of rushed development. This wasn’t anything overly major – most of its glaring problems today aren’t atypical for the time period it was released – but it comes down to a lack of polish.

          "description": "That’s a lot of hexagons\nCamlann Games has given us a little peek at Code::Arts’ upcoming 4X civilization builder, BoC: Birth of Cultures. While the “teaser” doesn’t show much of the meat in Birth of Cultures’ stew, it does portray its scale.\nBoC: Birth of Cultures features a world map that is “more than” 491,000 hex tiles in size. I’m no math person, but by my calculations, that’s a lot of tiles. For perspective, the largest map size in Civilization VI is 6,996 tiles. The map is apparently based on “realistic simulations.” Rather than using traditional fog of war, Birth of Cultures instead utilizes the planet’s natural curvature to limit what you can see. Bold of Code::Arts to take a stance like this when the whole flat/round shape of the earth is still under heated debate.\nhttps://youtu.be/tBmAIsq0eKg\nOn this large playfield, you’ll be overseeing the growth of a civilization starting from the ice age. You start as a nomadic tribe and progress through 60,000 years of development. Bold of Code::Arts to take a stance like this when the whole length of human history is still under heated debate.\nThe announcement highlights the size of the playfield and the effects of terrain and climate. However, Birth of Cultures promises a dynamic progression system and features a “sandbox-like combination of progression and cultures.” I’m not entirely sure what that means, but I’m going to assume it’s a bold stance on something.\nBoC: Birth of Cultures remains exclusive to PC via Steam for now. It is set to release into Early Access later in 2023.\nThe post Gigantic 4X strategy game BoC: Birth of Cultures coming later this year appeared first on Destructoid.",

In alignment with the launch date, the game will enter its new season, titled \"Cube of Rapacity\" and bringing a major overhaul to Torchlight: Infinite's loot and crafting systems, as well as the addition of a new character, Escapist Bing, and a variety of new systems, including the powerful \"Divinity Slate\".\nhttps://twitter.com/torchlight_xd/status/1649871334544138243?s=20\nTorchlight: Infinity, while carrying the Torchlight name, is not a product of the now sadly-defunct Runic Games, who created the franchise back in 2009 and would receive critical and player plaudits. This initial release would be followed by rock-solid sequel Torchlight II in 2012. Following Runic's closure in 2017, brand owners Perfect World would release inferior second sequel Torchlight III in 2020. Torchlight: Infinite, now developed by XD Inc. is a continuation of the franchise in a free-to-play PC/mobile vein, and features typical hack-and-slashing, dungeon-crawling action, although presented with more of a futuristic, cyber-fantasy aesthetic.\nTorchlight: Infinity launches May 9 on PC, iOS and Android platforms.\nThe post Torchlight: Infinite is leaving Early Access on PC and mobile May 9 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Vex means frustrate\nApogee Entertainment has pulled back the veil on Emberheart Games’ open-world crafting adventure Vexlands alongside a trailer. It will debut on PC in early 2024.\nPlaced in a vacant world, your job is to literally carve out your place by crafting and selling resources to buy new tiles in the procedurally-created world map. Each tile has the possibility of introducing something helpful or harmful into your environment, making each one a gamble. Your goal is to strengthen your homestead while venturing out into five biomes to lift the curse that has befallen the land.\nhttps://youtu.be/RjrAMPhi56k\nWithout fail, a cash-centric approach to an adventure always reminds me of Freshly-Picked Tingle’s Rosy Rupeeland. I kind of doubt that Vexlands will center around the populace’s greed, but on the other hand, I hope so.\nHonestly, the survival-crafting grounds have become well-stomped territory at this point, but Vexlands catches my eye for a few reasons. The first is that I absolutely love when an adventure has a cozy central base to unwind between adventures. That’s not uncommon for the genre, either. However, Emberheart Games handles development on Vexlands, who have previously done faithful remasters of Apogee classics like Crystal Caves, Secret Agent, and Monster Bash. It’s largely a solo developer headed by Primož Vovk, but they seem extremely passionate and hardworking with their projects, so I’ve had them earmarked since their release of Secret Agent.\nThat’s to say nothing of Apogee’s newest iteration, which is still helmed by founder Scott Miller. They seem really jazzed about their return as an indie publisher, and there’s a lot of charm in that optimism.\nVexlands only started development a few months ago, but Scott Miller estimates it’s about 25% done. As of writing, it will release only on PC.\nThe post Apogee shows off crafting adventure Vexlands for 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Coco is on their side? Heel turn!

In Smets' absence, production director Joel Eschler and general manager Hella Schmidt will receive promotion within studio ranks, while current studio director Jan-Bart van Beek will retain their role at Guerrilla, overseeing all current and future projects.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbl2wfyAgxY&ab_channel=PlayStation\nIn comments discussing Smets' departure, Guerrilla notes that it \"[has] full confidence in our new leadership as they steer Guerrilla towards a bright future, expanding the world of Horizon with Aloy's next adventure and our exciting online project.\" essentially confirming the continuation of the franchise. This news will hardly come as a surprise to anybody in this franchise-heavy gaming zeitgeist, but it's still a nice bit of security for franchise fans.\nMost recently, Horizon Forbidden West received a new expansion in the form of DLC Burning Shores, which sees Aloy travel to a dystopian (but somewhat familiar) new locale, where she meets new friends, encounters terrifying new Machines, and takes up arms with a selection of new weaponry. Despite a battalion of review bombs — derived mostly for the most eye-rolling of reasons — the DLC has been mostly well-received by both critics and Horizon fans.\nHorizon Forbidden West is available now on PlayStation platforms.

Inteleon was introduced in Pokemon Sword and Shield as a starter and became one of the most endearing and enduring 'Mons of that generation. The sassy-looking Inteleon has a super unique design, and it even dons a sniper perch in its Gigantamax form. It was also my starter pick, and I cherish it to this day!\nHere's all the info we have on Inteleon's return\nThe event will be held from April 28 at 9AM JST through May 1 at 8:59AM JST: with a repeat event echoing from May 5 through May 8 at the same time\nLike prior events, it'll have the Mightiest Mark (a title unique to these raid events)\nIt'll sport the Ice Tera Type\nYou can only catch one per save file, but you'll be able to fight it an unlimited amount of times for loot\nFollowing in the footsteps of prior events, Sobble and Drizzile are coming to Scarlet & Violet as well\nUsing the egg-breed method in Scarlet & Violet you'll be able to hatch a Sobble, which then evolves into Drizzile at level 16 (and Inteleon at 35).

This patch also tweaks the dead zone properties of the Xbox analog sticks.\nBut the update also removes the ability for the player to utilize a hack known as \"Scope Warping\" — A trick that allows Leon to glitch through certain walls while using the scope on his sniper rifle, or occasionally the iron sights on any weapon. The Resident Evil speedrunning community, savvy as they are, had already been using this glitch to fine effect in their efforts to complete the mission as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, once the game has been updated, this option is no more.

You find me at the end of a pretty heavy week, which has seen me operating on very, very little sleep, thanks to some medicine-induced insomnia. I'm most certainly looking forward to resting up today, and I hope that, wherever you are and however you're doing, that you too find the opportunity to take some time for yourself and recover from the trials and tribulations of the week.\nHave yourself some coffee and cake.

But in Japan, the Wars series was one of Nintendo's longest running, prolific franchises, starting on the Famicom before spreading its military might to the Gameboy, Super Famicom, GameCube, and the Wii.\nFor folks who had been following the franchise for the 20 years up to its abrupt conclusion, hearing that Intelligent Systems had no \"clear idea\" on the future of the franchise felt like the end of an era. Likewise, for longtime fans, this month's Advance Wars: Re-Boot Camp remakes from WayForward has a lot more weight to it when you know how much strife this series has been through.\nThe thing is though, when Days of…",

Cosmo Gang the Video adapts these characters and settings to a vertically scrolling shmup format, a genre in which Namco had proven itself a frontrunner.\nhttps://youtu.be/kfI4Z_P5joA\nOne to two players pilot the \"Hyper Beat\" space vessels, on a mission to fend off the Cosmo Gang, who has returned to cause further mayhem across the galaxy. The player battles waves of formation-based enemies over the course of 30+ stages, picking up power-ups and new weapons in order to even the odds against the Cosmo Gang's seemingly endless numbers. It should be noted that, despite its latter-day release date, the title is simplistic, even dated, when compared to the contemporary shmups of the day. Despite this, the arcade saw great success in its native Japan.\nCosmo Gang the Video is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.

          "description": "This is our new song\nContent creator Markiplier has announced that he’ll be writing, directing, and starring in a film based on David Szymanski’s short-form horror game, Iron Lung.\nReleased in 2021, Iron Lung became a surprise hit. Oh, hey, I’m even quoted on the Steam page. I absolutely loved it, as it was everything short-form horror should be. It was short, inventive, and also horror. It was more atmospheric than scary, so some people told me they found it boring, which hurt my ego. My recommendations are a lot like my children. I send them out in the world without fulling preparing them, and if they don’t succeed immediately, I feel unreasonably disappointed.\nIn any case, this adaptation of Iron Lung aims to be a theatrical feature. I’m not sure how you turn a 30-45 minute interactive experience into a 90+ minute feature without losing some of the mystique, but here we go. While Markiplier is writing and starring in the film, David Szymanski has been involved and assisting, and that includes helping create the script.\nhttps://twitter.com/DUSKdev/status/1649452805818658817?s=20\nMany of the details surrounding the adaptation are under wraps, but we do know it will co-star Caroline Rose Kaplan. Markiplier is financing the film by himself. While it hasn’t been revealed if the film will follow the plot of the game – which involved using a submarine to explore an ocean of blood in a universe where all habitable planets abruptly disappeared – David Szymanski says he “couldn't be happier with how it's turning out so far.”\nI don’t have many strong feelings here. I play things, but I rarely watch them. Therefore, both Markiplier and films as a whole are in my periphery, along with sports and human interaction. There’s no reason an Iron Lung movie couldn’t work, so here’s hoping the team can pull it off.\nThe post Iron Lung is being adapted to film by Markiplier appeared first on Destructoid.",

Some of mine are completely beaten up from constant use (and dropping them as a kid), and others are in pristine condition: compliments of my collector habits throughout my lifetime. But whatever the case might be, if you need a 3DS (or 2DS, or New 3DS, and so on) battery pack, Nintendo has official ones in stock now: no need to worry about a secondhand clunker.\n[gallery columns=\"2\" size=\"large\" ids=\"374741,374742\"]\nAll the links for 3DS battery pack restocks\nHere's the full replacement landing page for the 2DS/3DS. Note that some things might say \"out of stock,\" but as of the time of publication, clicking on those items will actually produce an \"add to cart\" in-stock notice.\nHere's the link to the New Nintendo 3DS XL and Nintendo 3DS XL battery packs - $14.99\nHere's the link to the Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo 2DS battery packs - $14.99\nIf you're the type of person who constantly plays 3DS and is enjoying all of those now-dead games, you might want to grab an extra or two for your model of choice. These things are relatively cheap by Nintendo standards and aren't always in stock. Remember that Nintendo changed their policy to allow free shipping for orders over $50.\nNintendo does have a helpful tip for those of you who are having 3DS issues though:\n\"If your system is not charging or holding a charge properly, we recommend checking our troubleshooting before deciding on a replacement. You'll need a small phillips tip screwdriver (not included) to open the battery compartment before you can replace the battery.\"\n\nThat troubleshooting page can be found here.\nThe post Nintendo just restocked official 3DS battery packs, if you need them appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Just a few days away from the launch of Horizon Forbidden West's Burning Shores DLC last week, Guerrilla Games has teased more adventures with Aloy. \nThis news comes from a statement released by the studio to announce that studio director and executive producer Angie Smets is leaving Guerrilla to serve as the head of development strategy for PlayStation Studios. It's a move similar to the one the team's former managing director, Hermen Hulst, made in 2019, transitioning from that director position to head of Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios. \n\n\nWithin that statement, Guerrilla teases what could be Horizon 3 or at least, a third game in Aloy's world, as reported by PlayStation Lifestyle. \n\"We have full confidence in our new leadership as they steer Guerrilla towards a bright future, expanding the world of Horizon with Aloy's next adventure and our exciting online project,\" the statement reads. \nAs you can see, Guerrilla isn't trying to hide it – the studio has plans for another adventure with Aloy. And while rumors and speculation point to the \"exciting online project\" being some kind of multiplayer game within the Horizon world, this statement made sure to separate Aloy's next adventure and that online project. \nIn terms of the studio's new makeup, the management team now consists of studio and production director Joel Eschler, studio director and general manager Hella Schmidt, and studio and art director Jan-Bart van Beek. Technical director Michiel van der Lee will \"be focusing on the future technology and strategy for the Decima engine.\" \nThis statement also includes some words from Smets, who leaves Guerrilla after \"an incredible 20 years\" there: \nFor more about Horizon, read Game Informer's Horizon Forbidden West review. \n[Source: PlayStation Lifestyle]\nWhat do you think comes first?

Join us today Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel. \nBanjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey. \nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

While we knew there would be downloadable content, we now have a much better idea about the cadence with which the new characters will arrive.\n\"A big part of Street Fighter's charm is the cast of characters from around the world that appear in each game,\" executive producer Shuhei Matsumoto said during today's Street Fighter 6 Showcase livestream. \"We believe that Street Fighter is where players can take control of unique characters with their own awesome fighting styles. For the players – and for us as well – the appeal of the characters themselves is the most important element of the series. With Street Fighter 6, we're continuing development to deliver new characters to you every year.\"\nDuring Year 1, which kicks off when the game launches, we will receive four new characters to the Street Fighter 6 roster. Rashid, A.K.I., Ed, and Akuma are the characters who will be made available during this first year of content. Rashid, who debuted in the base version of Street Fighter V, arrives in summer 2023. A.K.I., an all-new character, will arrive in fall 2023. Ed, who debuted in Street Fighter IV but was first playable in Street Fighter V, arrives in the early parts of 2024. Akuma, the Great Demon who first appeared in Super Street Fighter II Turbo, joins Street Fighter 6 in spring 2024. These characters will also appear in World Tour, the single-player RPG-inspired story mode, giving players some insight into their backgrounds.\nIf you buy either the Deluxe ot Ultimate Editions, you get the Year 1 characters included in that version. Street Fighter 6 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on June 2.

          "description": "Diablo IV may have gone gold, but Blizzard wants to ensure the servers are durable one more time before launch. Thus, it's opening the gates of Sanctuary to players one more time in a third open beta next month. \nThis next test weekend, dubbed Server Slam weekend, begins May 12 at 12 p.m. Pacific and ends May 14 at the same time. As the name suggests, Blizzard is running this beta to stress test the servers to make sure they're as sturdy as possible come June. This slice of the game is similar to the March betas in terms of content, but it will include updates and bug fixes garnered from feedback to the previous betas.\nServer Slam weekend will be a clean slate as progression from the previous betas does not carry over. Additionally, the beta supports couch co-op, cross-play, and cross-progression. Players can explore Fractured Peaks in its entirety through the Prologue and Act 1, complete World Events, and face Ashava, the toughest available World Boss. Completing challenges can earn the following new rewards:\nThe Initial Casualty title (earned by reaching Kyovashad with one character)\nThe Early Voyager title (earned by reaching Level 20 on one character)\nThe Beta Wolf Pack Cosmetic (earned by reaching Level 20 with one character)\nA new reward: the Cry of Ashava Mount Trophy (earned by defeating Ashava with one Level 20 character).\nDiablo IV launches on June 6 for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. It’s also Game Informer’s cover story for this month, and you can subscribe to the digital version of the magazine to read the issue or subscribe to the print edition hitting mailboxes this month.",

The footage showcases the protagonist, Jak, switching between his red, green, and blue magic for various attacks while also executing a number of powerful Furies, and using his Lash ability to pull enemies toward him and pull himself toward grapple points. You also get to see a little bit of puzzle-solving, which will also play a major role in the game.\n\n\nAlong with the gameplay footage, Ascendant also shared a video, seen below, highlighting some of the game's environments, which will be one of the first commercial games to use Unreal 5.1.\n\n\nFor a whole lot more on Immortals of Aveum, you can check out some hands-on impressions of the game resulting from a recent visit to Ascendant Studios here.

It will release on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC. Alongside this release date, Night School Studio also released a new trailer showcasing more of what to expect in this spooky paranormal thriller and there's a lot going on. \n\n\nSet five years after the first Oxenfree, which was released in 2016, Oxenfree II follows Riley as she returns to her hometown of Camena to investigate some strange electromagnetic waves. Just four hours ago, a mysterious cult opened a portal above Edwards Island, and Riley and her friends aren't sure they're the ones that need to save the island but they know they have to. The trailer seems to indicate we'll be playing with different timelines, spooky ghosts from other side, and more, and we'll be doing so using a special radio. \nThis time, though, we'll also have a walkie talkie to interact with locals and learn more about what might be going on. Oxenfree II: Lost Signals looks great and it hits PlayStation, Switch, and PC on July 12, 2023. \nOxenfree II: Lost Signals was originally due out in 2022 but it was delayed to 2023 last September. About a year before that delay, the game's developer was acquired by Netflix and you can read more about what that means for the studio here. \nAre you checking out Oxenfree II: Lost Signals this summer?

Publisher Humble Games announced this during today's Nintendo Indie World Showcase alongside a new trailer showcasing more of the game's titular night market. Unsurprisingly, Mineko's Night Market continues to look great and we can't wait to learn more about this special village later this year. \n\n\nIn Mineko's Night Market, an old Japanese-inspired village at the center of Mt. Fugu is visited long ago by Miko, a cat-like god. Miko visits the farms of this village each year to grant good fortune and prosperity to the farmers. However, some farmers grow impatient with their blessings and drive Miko out. With Miko banished from the land, this village works hard to create its own success and as time goes on, fewer and fewer people believe in the myth of Miko. \nBut some still do, and it sounds like we'll learn more about what that means for some characters throughout our journey in the game. \nIn the game, you'll befriend townsfolk, craft doodads, and ultimately prepare for the weekly night market. The quiet village becomes a bustling hub of commerce, parades, cat races, and stage performances. And when you're exploring the island, everything you find can be brought back and sold on the market. \nMineko's Night Market hits Switch and PC on September 26, 2023.

That means the game is essentially complete and is ready to be pressed to discs.\nThe game is set to arrive on PlayStation and Xbox consoles plus PC, and while it's good to go for launch, Blizzard plans to continually update the always-online game with various content updates over the next several years. Fans recently got to explore the game's revamped take on Sanctuary for themselves in two back-to-back weekend open betas in March, letting them taste a big slice of the now-finished pie.\n“Going gold is a landmark milestone for the incredible Diablo IV team, who have all worked so hard crafting the next-generation installment of this iconic franchise. This is a concrete, meaningful step toward our June 6 launch,” said Rod Fergusson, general manager of Diablo. “Whether players are veterans of the franchise or jumping in for the first time, we can’t wait for everyone to experience the full game: taking part in the incredible storytelling, experimenting with character classes and builds, and exploring what the endgame and the dark world of Sanctuary has to offer.”\nDiablo IV is Game Informer’s cover story this month, and you can subscribe to the digital issue to read it right now.

In his announcement tweet, Staten confirms that the game is a brand-new IP and referred to the project as a \"AAA multiplatform\" experience. You can read the full tweets below.\nSo today, I'm thrilled to announce that I've joined @Netflix Games as Creative Director for a brand-new AAA multiplatform game and original IP. Let's go! 2/2\nApril 17, 2023\nStaten is best known for his work as a writer and cinematic director at Bungie and Microsoft, mainly working on the Halo series. While he spent a few years working at the publishing side of Microsoft, in 2020, he returned to the Halo series to work on Halo Infinite, where he worked as the game's creative director. This continued until earlier this year when he returned to the publishing side of the company amidst widespread layoffs. Now, he's left the company entirely to work on this new project with Netflix.\nThis is only the latest news in Netflix's spree of expansion into the gaming industry. It recently released a sequel to Valiant Hearts as part of a collaboration with Ubisoft. Last year, it acquired the developers behind Cozy Grove, bringing its total number of internal development teams to five if you include the in-house studio that Staten just joined. On top of that, the film and tv side of Netflix has been working on loads of game adaptations, including Gears of War, Pokémon Concierge, and a new patch of episodes of Sonic Prime.\nDo you play games through your Netflix subscription?

After over a year of silence, we now know the project is officially underway, as well as the cast that will bring the series to life. \nSonic the Hedgehog director Jeff Fowler also sits at the helm of this series, and he tweeted the above image of the Knuckles clapperboard complete with the character’s cowboy hat that he donned in the ‘90s animated film Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie. Production is currently taking place in London, with Sonic the Hedgehog 2 screenwriter John Whittington serving as head writer and executive producer. \n#knuckles pic.twitter.com/Hr4zNjuLuj\nApril 17, 2023\nThe show is expected to premiere on Paramount+ later this year, with Idris Elba reprising his role as Knuckles. Variety reports that other returning stars from the films include Adam Pally as Wade Whipple and Tika Sumpter as Maddie. The cast also includes Edi Patterson (The Righteous Gemstones), Julian Barratt (Mindhorn), Scott Mescudi (AKA Kid Cudi), Ellie Taylor (Ted Lasso), and Rory McCann (Game of Thrones).\nPlot details remain scant, but Knuckles is set after the events of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and before the upcoming third film, set to hit theaters on December 20, 2024. The story centers on Knuckles taking on Wade as his student, training him to become an Echidna warrior. \nAre you looking forward to the Knuckles series? Let us know in the comments!",

This acquisition will begin next month and is expected to conclude in the second quarter of the 2024 fiscal year once it's completed the necessary antitrust reviews. \n“Among the rapidly growing global gaming market, the mobile gaming market has especially high potential, and it has been Sega’s long-term goal to accelerate its expansion in this field,” says Haruki Satomi, president and group CEO of Sega Sammy Holdings. “I feel blessed to be able to announce such a transaction with Rovio, a company that owns 'Angry Birds', which is loved across the world, and home to many skilled employees that support the company’s industry leading mobile game development and operating capabilities. Historically, as represented by the ‘Sonic the Hedgehog' series, Sega has released countless video game titles to various gaming platforms. I am confident that, through combination of both companies’ brands, characters, fanbase, as well as corporate culture and functionality, there will be significant synergies created going forward.”\n“Red and Sonic the Hedgehog: two globally recognized and iconic characters made by two remarkably complementary companies, with a worldwide reach that spans mobile, PC/console, and beyond,” says Rovio CEO Alexandre Pelletier-Normand in a statement. “Combining the strengths of Rovio and Sega presents an incredibly exciting future.”\nRovio is best known as the creator of Angry Birds, a massively successful series of mobile games that have since turned into a global media brand. In addition to a multitude of games, the series has spawned two animated films and several TV and web series.",

Though the story begins by following protagonist Clive in his 20s, the plot will also explore periods of his teen years and 30s. We got a look at the world map, various accessibility rings, and the combat prowess of Clive’s faithful wolf companion, Torgal. \nWe also looked at Cid’s hideaway, a large headquarters that opens up later in the game where you can craft gear, buy items at a store, check quests, interact with allies, and practice abilities in a special training room. Despite showing off so much, teases that Square Enix still has plenty to share in the future regarding story quests, side quests, and endgame content. \nFinal Fantasy XVI launches on June 22 for PlayStation 5.

Developer Rocksteady posted a short message on Twitter stating it wants to “take the time needed” to ensure the best possible experience. Check it out below.\nSuicide Squad: Kill the Justice League puts players in the shoes of Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, Deadshot, and King Shark as they fight to rescue Metropolis from an invasion by Brainiac. The villain has hijacked the minds of the Justice League, meaning the Squad has to take down Earth's greatest protectors to save the day. The game has received a hefty dose of fan vitriol since its last gameplay demonstration in February confirmed an always-online requirement as well as live service elements, such as a cosmetics-only battle pass. Other fans have found its cooperative loot-based shooting to be an uninspired fit for the property.\nAlthough we don't know the specifics behind the delay, sources told Bloomberg in its original report last month that Rocksteady was only pushing the game to add polish and did not plan to overhaul the game’s existing framework. Even though a nearly-year-long delay is a lot of time, it's still very unlikely that it's enough for the team to make the sort of dramatic changes some fans are hoping for. We'll have to wait and see how Rocksteady spruces up the Suicide Squad and hope it results in a quality experience when the dust finally settles. \nWhat do you think of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League's delay? Let us know in the comments.",

          "description": "The Library of Congress announced its 2023 class of National Recording Registry inductees, and it includes a video game song for the first time. That big honor goes to the classic Super Mario Bros. theme.\nOfficially titled “Ground Theme,” it was composed by Nintendo’s Koji Kondo and first appeared in 1985’s Super Mario Bros in World 1-1. The song has since become the most well-known melody of the Mario franchise, not to mention one of the most recognizable music tracks in video games. Now, it will be forever preserved alongside some of pop culture's most famous and influential songs. \n“Having this music preserved alongside so many other classic songs is such a great honor,” said Kondo in a statement. “It's actually a little bit difficult to believe.”\nMario’s classic tune will be inducted alongside heavy hitters such as Madonna’s “Like a Virgin,” Jimmy Buffet’s “Margaritaville,” Queen Latifah’s “All Hail the Queen,” and Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas is You.” You can read the full list of inductees at the Libary of Congress’ website. \nThis is quite an achievement for Nintendo and especially Kondo, who has lent his talents to numerous other Nintendo soundtracks and also had a hand in composing the music for the very successful The Super Mario Bros. Movie. You can read our recent interview with Kondo and Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto about the making of the film here.",

The animated adaptation of Nintendo’s flagship franchise has emerged from its first weekend as the best opening animated film of all time, achieving several other records along the way. \nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, the film walked away with over $375 million in sales in its first five days, surpassing Frozen 2 as the top opening animated film premiere globally. That includes a $206 million domestic haul, $146 million of which was earned over the weekend (remember the film premiered on a Wednesday). Overseas, the movie has earned over $173 million.\nAdditionally, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is now the top opening film of 2023 (beating Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania), has become Illumination’s most successful opening, and has the best opening of any video game film adaptation (surpassing Sonic the Hedgehog 2's debut). The film also has the biggest five-day premiere ever, a record previously held by Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. If all of that wasn’t enough, the film also has the biggest IMAX opening weekend of all time at $21.6 million globally.\nNeedless to say, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is exceeding expectations, and it’ll be interesting to see if it can maintain such a strong start. To get an idea of how it fares, you can read our review of the film here.
