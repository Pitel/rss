The most recent game — Atelier Ryza 3 — is the 24th mainline entry in a series that has had a new release almost every year since 1997. However, due to the franchise's more niche appeal, not every entry has made it out of Japan due to localization costs.\nAtelier Marie, the first entry in the series, was one such game that remained Japan-exclusive until now, with the release of Atelier Marie Remake: The Alchemist of Salburg finally bringing it to the West for the first time. Though it’s clear that this remake has been built on the foundation of a simple game released for the original PlayStation, Gust has nonetheless done a stellar job in modernizing its more antiquated components while enhancing its strongest features. Atelier Marie may not have set a new high-water mark for the series with this return, but it’s an impressively enjoyable RPG adventure that no fan of the series will want to miss out on\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Developer Night School Studio hasn’t gone out of its way here to create anything wildly different to its debut title, but has wisely opted to implement everything it's learned over the past seven years or so to create a game that feels much better paced with a smaller, more focused cast of characters.\nTaking place five years after the original, Oxenfree II focuses on Riley Poverly as she returns to the coastal town of Camena (with the original Edward’s Island visible in the distance) to investigate interferences with radio signals throughout the environment. There, she meets up with Jacob Summers, an old acquaintance who becomes her partner over the course of the five-six hour campaign.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "When I played a timed early demo of Forever Skies last year, my key question about this airborne Subnautica-like was how it would successfully guide its players across its boundless world of ruined, rusting skyscrapers, overgrown plant tendrils and swampy, toxic clouds. As we searched for a rumoured cure that would save what's left of humanity back in the depths of space, would we be ping-ponging from perilous rooftop to perilous turbine pad unaided as we bobbed along the nauseous expanse below? Or would it be a more guided affair, with forgotten text logs and computer terminals nudging us toward tailored waypoints? \nHaving now played its recently-released early access version, the answer is a mix of both, with the freedom to scavenge and craft new modules for your burgeoning airship at your leisure while a handy radar points you in the direction of its critical story path. Assuming you've found a busted one to research and 3D print yourself, of course. The tools you need to survive don't come easily in this strangely picturesque wasteland, but they're also not so hard to track down that you ever feel truly threatened by the minutiae of staying alive. It's a pleasant mix for casual survival toe dippers like myself right now, but the dramatic climax of its first major story chunk suggests this is but a brief calm before the eventual storm.\nRead more",

The nervousness of not truly understating the supernatural forces its cast of troubled teens was up against, the heightened tension of uncovering the buried secrets of Edwards Island, and - what I loved the most - the finely tuned undercurrent of dread that quietly crept through the game. It conjured a sense of unease in me that I couldn't shake loose, and it was a feeling that clung to me throughout my entire playthrough.\nSo I was pretty stoked when Night School Studio announced Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals, a direct follow-up set five years after the original game. Lost Signals may take place in a new location with a new cast of characters, but there's still a lot of overlap. There are supernatural spooks, personal character drama, creepy radio equipment, and those good ol' screen glitches that I've missed so much. But with all these tethers to the first game, Lost Signals feels like a re-tread of the same ground. It's still a good sequel, I should add, but it's not a particularly satisfying one.\nRead more",

Thankfully, the post-launch plans do get slightly weirder with two crossovers: one with Street Fighter and another with Monster Hunter.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "In the wake of publishers adopting NFTs and predictive language programs so flimsy that even 1998 Kojima would have laughed you out of the room for daring to call them actual AI, you fools, you complete donkeys, Konami’s infamous pivot-to-pachinko seems almost quaint now. Perhaps embarrassed by the relatively small amount of egg on their face compared to some of their more ridiculous contemporaries, Konami have decided to come crawling back to try and buy our collective forgiveness by way of their second-only-to-Squeenix PS1 back catalogue. Well it won’t work, you swines! What’s that? Suikoden remasters? Well, it still won’t work! Metal Gear Solid on Steam, you say? Balls. Balls and zounds. \nMGS1 has, of course, been available via GOG for quite a while now. It’s a noble, if barebones port, but it does mean I have Snake-related options besides dusting off my PS1 classic, which is currently doing a bang-up job keeping a dodgy table bang-upright. Either way, I’ve found myself on a bit of Metal Gear kick recently. Phantom Pain, for all its narrative faults, holds up still as a cracking stealth sandbox rivalled only by Hitman. And MGS1 is still dramatic, still goofy, still alternately comedically overwrought and genuinely touching. But most of all, it's still haunted by the same ghosts that dwelled inside it all those years ago. \nRead more",

Yesterday’s vote had 91 workers voting “yes” and 26 voting “no.” \r\n\n\r\nAEGIS announced plans to unionise earlier this year, with goals that included higher base pay, better benefits, balanced schedules, and proper staffing to “end patterns of overwork.” At the time, AEGIS claimed that “nearly a third of Sega’s long-time workers still lack full-time status, paid time off, proper training, or even bereavement leave.”\r\n\n \nRead more",

Thankfully, Amazon Prime Day has your back, offering some pretty tasty discounts on the Samsung Pro Plus in its 256GB and 512GB varieties.\r\n\nOur James reckons these specific cards are the best fit for Valve's chunky handheld, and I agree. As usual I took his advice and ended up with the 512GB card that has served me well over the last 12 months. Although the 256GB model might be enough if you're planning to stuff it full of games with a smaller footprint (such as the excellent Pizza Tower, Vampire Survivors or many other of the Steam Deck's best games), I'd recommend the 512GB card if you're leaning towards beefier titles.\n\n Read more",

          "description": "Larian Studios are nothing if not enablers of wild, unspoken desires. In Divinity: Original Sin II, they provided the impossible - making each companion character a playable protagonist, and weaving their unique plotlines into the tapestry of the main story. It was one of the RPG’s great innovations - handing you a killer backstory, a tangible motivation, and a set of prompts for how you might go about roleplaying your exiled lizard prince or demon-possessed musician. For those of us who struggle with the blank page of character creation, it was a godsend (quite literally, since the adventure concerned your ascension).\nChoosing a set character came with an obvious drawback, however. It robbed you of the chance to make the most of Larian’s character creation tools, fiddling with freckles and tattoos and biceps until you had an alter ego entirely your own. With Baldur's Gate 3, Larian have threaded the needle, conceiving an origin character who looks, sounds and fights however you like, yet enters the game with a frankly frightening amount of personal history and suspiciously lumpy baggage - and as they announced during the final Panel from Hell last week, some of that baggage will be soaked in blood. Optionally available as one of seven starting personalities, the Dark Urge is a mass murderer. Their species, gender, class and eyebrow thickness are up to you, but what you can’t change is their deep and insatiable need to kill for pleasure.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Oh, and the deadly brolly, of course. I mean, it’s a gunbrella. What else is there to say?\nThe demo I played at PAX is now available to download and play on Steam, and I highly recommend it. Even if you’re a bit like me and Metriodvanias aren’t really your thing, the hour-long demo is entirely linear, and messing around with the gunbrella's many, many abilities is more than a good enough reason to have a play, even if you're just mucking around.\nRead more",

Cue the confetti!\nUnpacking is a puzzle game that's all about pulling your homewares and personal items out of cardboard moving boxes and placing them in a new home. It's best described as a relaxing house moving sim but it's also a sort of block-fitting puzzle game. Finding the perfect spot for each item is largely down to your own personal taste, but there are some loose 'room rules' (no, you cannot put your toaster in the bedroom for some midnight cheese toastie action). If you like organising games - A Little To The Left, Sticky Business, Wilmot's Warehouse and the like - then Unpacking is the game for you.\nRead more",

On the corner of the first checkpoint, Lindsay flipped his rover, snagging the vehicle on a rock that immediately broke his scanning systems and left him driving blind. By the time of our chat, though, he’s laughing. Exo Rally Championship is a racer for those who like to roll with the punches, quite literally - an anecdote generator for players who adore the challenge of preparing for the worst, and then adapting to changing circumstances on the fly.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "This Friday on July 7th, Frontier Development's Warhammer RTS Age Of Sigmar: Realms Of Ruin is holding its first open beta test for its 1v1 multiplayer mode. Players will be able to go head to head with two of the game's four factions - the golden fantasy knights of the Stormcast Eternals and the sneaky green stink lads of the Orruk Kruleboyz - giving us our first taste of how they'll handle in battle, and the kinds of powerplays we'll be making with their respective (and rather handsome) tabletop miniature recreations. \nAnd having played four rounds of its 1v1 matches already at a press event last week, it's quite the thrill - and I say that as someone with no real attachment to Warhammer or Age Of Sigmar's specific lore legacy. The Stormcast Eternals and their flying hammer brutes are just as devastating as you'd imagine, while the lads lads lads and their Killaboss Kruleboyz are challenging late-game bloomers that will give even hardened strategy game veterans plenty to sink their teeth into. Both factions are great fun, and I'm very much looking forward to jumping back in this weekend.\nRead more",

An unassuming first-person puzzler about a puppet fisherman living in a lighthouse, it dazzled with its incredible deployment of VR's unique sense of perspective and scale. It's the kind of game that, if it featured a psychotic AI and some cake memes instead of a beard in a yellow anorak, would have been heralded as a revolution in play.\r\n\n\r\nIt would have been easy to follow-up A Fisherman's Tale in the same way, make a bigger game with a few new gimmicks and a comedy lobster voiced by Stephen Merchant. But that isn't what developer InnerspaceVR has done. Instead, Another Fisherman's Tale bends your neural pathways in entirely new forms, offering a completely different kind of puzzling. The results are equally innovative and almost as interactively satisfying - although a lack of refinement in the latter category is a deflating puncture in the game's dinghy.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The first trailer revealed lots of strange, whimsical environments, equally whimsical-looking beasties and a little person flying around on the back of a giant bird herding them around in delightful swoops and swirls. We also saw some sheep grazing in a meadow before they, too, started to fly alongside your wilder, more abstract animal pals. But the question of what you do in Flock remained unanswered - until last week, when developers Hollow Ponds showed us a little bit more of their creature collecting game during the Annapurna Interactive Showcase stream.\nThere, they revealed that we'll need to collect and charm these creatures to get them to join our respective flocks, and that we'll be able to do so in co-op with a pal. It looks intensely charming, but it still left me with lots of unanswered questions. So I spoke to devs Ricky Haggett and Richard Hogg to find out more. Naturally, there are some things they're not ready to reveal about Flock just yet, but they did tell me that you'll start on top of a mountain and will be wending your way down it with your flock of sheep. \nRead more",

          "description": "Přestože je právě léto, Virtuální Bastlírna je tu opět jako každý měsíc. Technici a vědci nic jako prázdniny nebo okurkovou sezónu zřejmě neznají! Důkazem budiž, že témat, která strahovské bastlíře tento měsíc zaujala, je více než za květen a červen dohromady. Ze žhavých novinek můžou zmínit nový DAQ nástroj Analog Discovery 3. Ohledně RP 2040 se dělo více věcí - podpora Bluetooth pro RPi Pico W, bootloader startující program z SD karty, BASIC nebo třeba bezdrátovou páječku od MiniWare. Rozhodně ale nelpí na jednom procesoru - Arduino Uno R4 bude v sobě mít ESP32-S3 a vyšlo i nové ESP32-P4.\r\n\r\nZe softwarového světa můžou bastlíři ukázat LoraWAN senzor na odečet vodoměrů s kamerou, jak se hackuje chytrý zubní kartáček, novinky v PrusaSliceru nebo KVM pro desktopy založené na Rpi CM4, opensource kalkulačku s reverzní polskou notací a výpočty nejistot nebo novo verzi KiCADu.\r\n\r\nZa hardware pak strahováci shrnou novinky, které jim přistály v poště - NanoVNA-H4, TinyPFA, TinySA Ultra, generátor pulzů a GPSDO od Leo Bodnara (a opravený SW pro něj). Pak ukázky bastlení - sondy magnetického pole, dokonce několik iterací a jak s nimi hledat problematické zdroje vyzařování a jak se dá postavit Rogowského cívka včetně zesilovače. Možná i ukáží jak minimalizovat rušení z izolovaných měničů, jak minimalizovat šum na napájení nebo jak se krásně měří s DMM6500 od Keithley.\r\n\r\nAť už vás zaujalo cokoliv z nabízených témat nebo chcete ukázat nějaký svůj bastl, dorazte! Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve čtvrtek 13. července od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

But beyond its potential for use in gaming handhelds, it's quite fascinating to see how powerful the Z1 Extreme actually is when removing power restrictions on this SoC. In this article is a wide range of CPU benchmarks putting the Z1 Extreme up against the new Ryzen 7 7840U laptop SoC as well as prior generation Ryzen 7 PRO 6850U for reference. When adjusting the ACPI Platform Profile configuration, the Ryzen Z1 Extreme proves to be very robust from a low-power SoC delivering good battery performance up through pulling 50+ Watts while outperforming the 7840U.",

          "description": "Time to return to Return to Castle Wolfenstein\nIt's not uncommon for older games to be given a modern facelift. Case in point: the original Half-Life recently got a ray tracing mod, and the new lighting makes the aged FPS look pretty spiffing. Now it's Return to Castle Wolfenstein's time to shine, thanks to an upcoming modification for the 22-year-old title.\nAs spotted by DSO Gaming, graphics engineer and Twitter user Dihara Wijetunga is currently working on a project that will see the lighting for the 2001 Wolfenstein entry be given a boost. In a recent tweet, the modder uploaded a brief clip from the game showing the path tracing technology that's being implemented.\nhttps://twitter.com/diharaw94/status/1677846492638224385\nThose familiar with the original game will see the difference, with bolder light and sharper shadows really giving the titular castle a gloomy look. For those who don't quite see it, Wijetunga's clip handily gives a side-by-side comparison, so you can see how RtCW used to look, and how it will look once the mod releases.\nWhen is Return to Castle Wolfenstein with path tracing coming out?\nThere doesn't appear to be a release date for it yet, but it's worth keeping an eye on Wijetunga's GitHub portfolio. If nothing else, you can check out their other work while you wait for the mod.\nAccording to the report from DSO Gaming, path tracing for Return to Castle Wolfenstein will not be using Nvidia's new RTX Remix software. Instead, the upcoming modification will be native to the game.\nSo far, what Wijetunga has done is pretty impressive. It kind of gives you a good sense of just how far video game technology has advanced over the years. It may be more than 20 years old at this point, but RtCW is something of a classic, so it'll be nice to replay it with some visual oomph.\nThe post Here’s a quick peek at Return to Castle Wolfenstein with path tracing appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s pretty neat! You have to appease both your villagers and the creature that they live on in a pretty inventive interpretation of symbiosis. It’s been in Early Access since September 2022, receiving steady updates since then.\nThe Ocean update adds a new saltwater biome and mechanics based around it. There are new resources and buildings to take advantage of the maritime industry. You can discover islands and shipwrecks, and the Onbu you live on paddles through the water.

It launched in early access back in 2020. It bills itself as a love letter to H.P. Lovecraft and Uzumaki mangaka Junji Ito. It is very “legally distinct” from Junji Ito’s style. Like, this game was developed because no one else was making a Junji Ito game and the developer got tired of waiting, so they made their own. It’s sort of a visual horror RPG.\n[caption id=\"attachment_391230\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Fangamer[/caption]\nThe physical version being offered by Fangamer is mercifully subdued. I don’t need more giant boxes full of merchandise I don’t use. World of Horror just comes with an instruction manual with an art card. It’s set to ship out October 19, 2023, the same day that it comes out of early access and releases on Switch.\nI used to buy a lot from Fangamer back in the day, back when they sold “legally distinct” video game merchandise. I still wear T-shirts I bought from them more than ten years ago. Then the Canadian loonie lost parity with the greenback, so I only buy sporadically now. They’ve gone all legitimate with real licensing, though. I’m so proud of them.\nYou can currently get World of Horror in its Early Access state on PC. It will be releasing fully on PC and Switch on October 19, 2023. That’s the same day that the physical version will release, but you can preorder now.\nThe post World of Horror is getting the physical treatment on Switch appeared first on Destructoid.",

During the event, Capcom revealed its roadmap for the first three seasons of Exoprimal that includes upcoming content over the next few months. Perhaps the most exciting reveal is two separate crossover events with popular Capcom titles: Street Fighter 6 and Monster Hunter.\n[caption id=\"attachment_391178\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Capcom/YouTube[/caption]\nMonths of content is already in the pipeline for Exoprimal\nSeason 1 will kick off two weeks after release, and Exoprimal will receive its first update with an all new PvE mode: Savage Gauntlet. This mode will rotate tough weekly missions giving players a chance to test out their best loadouts in end-game missions. Rounding out Season 1 is ten new Alpha variant exosuits wielding unique weapons. This update will release on August 16.\nIn mid-October, Season 2 will add new missions, the Ocean Platform map, and even more exosuits. Street Fighter fans should look forward to Season 2 as it will feature a SF6 crossover collaboration. As part of the crossover, we will get new exosuits based on Ryu and Guile.\nFinally, Season 3 will drop early next year featuring even more exosuits, a new Neo Triceratops boss fight, and a Monster Hunter crossover event.  No precise details were provided for this crossover, but we can assume there will be some new giant monsters from the Monster Hunter universe for us to beat up on.\nThose looking to save the world from dinosaurs can do so soon. Exoprimal releases on July 14 on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. PC and Xbox players can check out the game for free as part of Xbox Game Pass.

That's right, you get LEGO Half-Life 2. If you ever wondered what it'd be like to take on the Combine or seek the Vortigaunt's help as one of the Danish company's little plastic figures, wonder no more.\nThe mod is available on the Steam workshop (thanks, PCGamesN) and comes from user Not Dave or Daniel. It's described as a \"full conversion\" project that basically swaps out major Half-Life 2 characters for LEGO figurines. It seems the modder is aiming to eventually replace all the characters in the game, but the images so far show that a few have already been done.\n[caption id=\"attachment_391138\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"] Image via Not Dave or Daniel/Steam.[/caption]\nFans of HL2 will recognize the LEGO facsimiles of Dr. Kleiner, Alyx Vance, Father Grigori, and even the mute protagonist himself, Gordon Freeman. The mod is available to download for free now, and it sounds like there are going to be some updates in the future.\nSo are we gonna talk about..?\nLook, it's nearly impossible to talk about Half-Life without mentioning the whereabouts of the long-awaited third entry. It's been 16 years since Episode Two, and it's safe to assume that a new game in the series is not happening. In fact, back in 2017, ex-Valve writer Marc Laidlaw basically gave away what was likely to be the plot of Half-Life 3, perhaps in an attempt to appease fans who were still waiting.\nIt's just not coming. We have to accept that. But at least the games that are out are still getting a lot of love.

The result is a resounding ‘yes’ with 91 voting to form a union and 26 voting against it. The vote now just needs to be certified by the National Labor Relations Board.\nThis vote creates the largest union in the video game industry. It will cover Sega of America’s Irvine, California branch and more than 200 roles. This comes as part of a continued and long-overdue push by workers in the industry to unionize for better treatment. Just this past January, Zenimax QA workers voted to unite.\nhttps://twitter.com/takesAEGIS/status/1678481056520101889?s=20\nSega is largely a Japanese corporation, but like many publishers, they have offices all over the world. This past February, Sega of Japan actually gave its employees a 30% salary increase, but Sega of America didn’t follow suit. AEGIS has stated that its goals are for pay to meet inflation and for better staffing to prevent overworking.\nI’m somewhat surprised that the idea of unionizing has taken this long to catch on in the industry. We’re nearly two decades on from the “EA Spouse” blog that exposed some of the horrible practices of the industry. This mostly involved unpaid overtime, but even after successful lawsuits, crunch remains a commonly used practice across the industry. However, because this is an industry that often attracts individuals and takes advantage of their passion, many workers are afraid to put their job on the line in an attempt to unionize.\nHere’s hoping that this trend continues and we see more stories like this over the next few years.\nThe post Sega of America employees win union vote appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Give it a quick watch before you play the new entry\nWhile the late summer/early fall of 2023 has some pretty killer releases lined up; when it comes to near-future releases, I'm arguably most excited for Pikmin 4. It looks like Nintendo is shaking up the formula quite a bit, and a new brief video tutorial showcases just how that's going to play out in the main fourth entry.\nSaid video tutorial covers the following game mechanics:\nGathering up your Pikmin (which is still done through an area-of-effect whistle)\nOrdering Pikmin to build (chucking them at stuff)\nFighting enemies with Pikmin (chucking them at enemies)\nWhat different types of Pikmin do, as well as the Oatchi\nThe latter bit is arguably the most important! It reminds everyone that the red Pikmin type is \"strong and resistant to fire,\" blue Pikmin can breathe underwater, yellow Pikmin can conduct electricity [and can be thrown farther], and so on. Rock, ice, and winged Pikmin are also briefly shown off at the tail-end, with no details. But we know that rock-type Pikmin can deal crucial damage in combat (and can break certain walls), ice Pikmin can freeze enemies and bodies of water, and winged Pikmin can fly/carry objects places some Pikmin can't reach.\nOf course, the Nintendo would be remiss to not mention the new Oatchi (dog) mechanic, which is briefly shown at the end. This is arguably the biggest mixup the series has offered to date, and the demo alone offers a ton of strategic possibilities for the concept. You can put this video training to good use when Pikmin 4 launches on July 21, 2023 on Switch.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HERRRVpEX3o\nThe post This Pikmin 4 video tutorial is a nice refresher for how the series works appeared first on Destructoid.",

Electronic Arts revealed an all new Seattle-based AAA development studio, Cliffhanger Games, as the developer.\nCliffhanger is led by industry veteran Kevin Stephens, former Studio Head of Monolith Productions. Monolith is best known for Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor and its sequel Shadow of War.\n“We’re dedicated to delivering fans a definitive and authentic Black Panther experience, giving them more agency and control over their narrative than they have ever experienced in a story-driven video game. Wakanda is a rich SuperHero sandbox, and our mission is to develop an epic world for players who love Black Panther and want to explore the world of Wakanda as much as we do,” Kevin said.\nBlack Panther will feature an original story as a third-person single-player game. Cliffhanger will work directly with Marvel Games to ensure Wakanda feels authentic.\nAt this point it seems like every big publisher has a piece of the Marvel pie. Sony has Spider Man while Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal recently released Marvel's Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy.\nThis project marks Electronic Arts' first foray into the Marvel universe since Marvel Nesmesis: Rise of the Imperfects released back in 2005.

Of course, you remember Fiddlebert from Pikmin, right? For those that don't; Fiddlebert was supposedly Pikmin 1's second captain. He was \"rushed\" since he was just a smaller and green version of Olimar. He would sometimes randomly speak another language and was removed from the Wii and Switch ports of the game...at least, that's what folks on the Pikmin subreddit would have you believe.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Pikmin/comments/14pn5qe/who_the_fuck_is_fiddlebert/\nPikmin fans are currently debating the existence of the green character.

But I have to admit, I don't remember Fiddlebert ever existing. Maybe I just didn't play Pikmin as much as I remember, but surely I'd recognize this green Olimar, right?\nPikmin 4 releases on Nintendo Switch on July 21.

          "description": "It's the first new class in the world of Diablo in nine years\nThe highlight of the recent Diablo Developer Update was certainly the reveal of Diablo 4 Season of the Malignant. However, Diablo Immortal also got some big news with the unveiling of a brand new class. The Blood Knight is the first new class in the entire Diablo franchise since the release of Diablo III's Crusader in 2014.\nDiablo Immortal certainly isn't for everyone. But despite launching with an extremely predatory monetization system, the mobile-focused action-RPG still went on to make over $500 million in just one year. Surprisingly, the Blood Knight will be free and accessible to everyone when it releases on July 13.\n[caption id=\"attachment_390691\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot via Activision Blizzard/Twitch[/c…",

Of course, the next stage of that campaign: My Nintendo swag!\nAs you may recall, Nintendo celebrated the re-release Pikmin 3 in 2020 with a sticker and coaster set. Well, in a recent news post on the My Nintendo site, the publisher confirmed that there will be a sticker set coming in the future for Pikmin 4. Here's the full rundown from Nintendo:\n\"Add some cuteness to your smooth surfaces with these lovely 3” x 3” stickers! One features a Blue Pikmin, a Yellow Pikmin, and a Red Pikmin ready for whatever’s next. The other shows an explorer and a squad of Pikmin riding on the back of space dog Oatchi.\"\n\nGiven the timeframe of prior announcements, it could be anywhere between 1-2 weeks until we see the set go up on the My Nintendo storefront. Expect the price to be in line with prior sticker sets on the service, ranging from 300-500 Platinum Points.\nThere's also a Pikmin 4 demo promo for free Platinum\nIn other My Nintendo news, there's a Pikmin 4 retailer demo promo going on soon, which can net you 200 Platinum Points.\nAll you need to do is play the demo of the game at select retailers, then scan a QR code at the end. That's it! This particular gimmick will be running from July 7 through October 19, so you have plenty of time. Nintendo mentions Best Buy, GameStop, Target, and Walmart by name.\nUpdate (July 7, 2023) - The Pikmin 4 stickers are now available\nGood news! The stickers became available in record time. You can find them right here for 200 Platinum Points.\nRemember that you can bundle multiple items together so you aren't paying standard shipping for a few stickers.\nThe post The Pikmin 4 My Nintendo reward is…stickers appeared first on Destructoid.",

And in that trailer, you can hear a tease of his original track, “Splintered Minds.” \nCheck out “Splintered Minds” in the latest Stray Souls trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Yamaoka’s track sounds great, and Silent Hill fans know this is probably just a taste of some excellent music from the famed composer. The trailer also reveals plenty more Stray Souls gameplay, which features third-person gunplay, some stealth elements, and plenty of terrifying monsters. \nStray Souls hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via Steam this fall. \nAre you going to check out Stray Souls later this year?

          "description": "Today, a California judge denied the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's request for a preliminary injunction in its case to block Microsoft and Xbox from acquiring Activision Blizzard. Now, shortly after the ruling, Microsoft has announced it will pause its appeal efforts against the Competition and Markets Authority in the U.K. so that it and the CMA can negotiate. \nBack in April, the UK regulatory body blocked Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard over cloud gaming concerns. With a July 18 deadline for the acquisition, Microsoft theoretically needs to either mark the U.K. out of its market as it relates to this purchase or negotiate a deal with the CMA to quell the regulator's concerns. Microsoft was previously set to appear in court to appeal the CMA's block on July 28. According to Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith, that won't be happening now as the two parties will instead attempt to negotiate a deal that satisfies both. \nOur statement on the mutual request with the CMA for a pause of our appeal in the UK: pic.twitter.com/8Aky2IJjxS\nJuly 11, 2023\nIt's important to note that the Competition Appeal Tribunal still needs to either approve or deny this request, as noted by The Verge, but the former seems incredibly likely. In a statement received by The Verge, the CMA said it is \"ready to consider any proposals from Microsoft to restructure the transaction in a way that would address the concerns set our in our Final Report,\" likely alluding to its concerns over cloud gaming (concerns that Microsoft disagrees with). \nGame Informer has reached out to the CMA for a statement regarding Smith's announcement and will update the story if a comment or statement is received. \nWhat do you think this means for Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard?

          "description": "Tuatara Games has revealed its next project, and it’s a sci-fi survival shoot ‘em up called Let Them Come: Onslaught. \nTuatara Games has released games before – it released Bare Butt Boxing this May – but it’s perhaps best known for its work as a AAA VFX support studio working on games like Valorant, Fortnite, Godfall, and more. It’s set to release Let Them Come: Onslaught on PC via Steam Early Access in the first quarter of 2024. Let Them Come: Onslaught puts players behind the gun of a lone survivor on an alien planet who must survive hordes of creatures by activating nukes to blow up the planet. \nCheck out the teaser trailer for Let Them Come: Onslaught for yourself below:\n\n\nTuatara Games says the game features dynamic weather, and a wide range of weapons, including a flamethrower, laser beam, electric grenade, orbital strikes, and more. As you mow down hordes of aliens, you can upgrade your soldier with increased health, defense, reduced weapon cooldowns, and shields you can activate on the battlefield. To obtain these upgrades, you spend XP you earn on each run.\n“We are huge fans of this emerging gameplay experience, and are thrilled to reveal our love letter to the games that inspired us,” Tuatara Games founder Klemen Lozar writes in a press release. “Using our team’s VFX expertise, survivors can expect to fight for their lives through adrenaline-inducing experiences that have the best visuals of the genre.” \n\nLet Them Come: Onslaught also features roguelite elements, meaning a lot will be lost in between each run. However, credits collected on the battlefield stay with you, and you can spend them on permanent upgrades in the Armory. \nTuatara Games says Let Them Come: Onslaught hits Steam Early Access sometime in Q1 of 2024. It will cost $4.99. The team says, “The decision to launch first on Early Access comes from [the] continued knowledge in incorporating improvements to ensure the final 1.0 launch is as optimized as possible.”",

The fifth iteration was long-presumed to be in-development, but during the UFC's tentpole International Fight Week event over the weekend, EA Sports and the UFC made it official. While no additional details were revealed outside of the logo, we know that a full reveal is coming in September of this year.\nEA Sports UFC 5 marks the longest gap between entries since the series' introduction. Since the first EA Sports UFC game arrived in 2014, the games have arrived every two years, with UFC 2 arriving in 2016, UFC 3 in 2018, and UFC 4 in 2020. The series has traditionally been developed by EA Vancouver, so that's the expectation with this entry as well, but no official confirmation has been provided by EA one way or the other on that front. EA Sports UFC 5 will also mark the first game in the series to launch since the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S hit the market, so we might be able to expect a leap forward in terms of graphical fidelity and/or performance.\nEA Sports UFC 4 launched on August 14, 2020, and introduced various customization options, as well as new grappling and takedown physics, plus a more fleshed-out single-player career mode. EA Sports has also continually updated the game's roster, adding tens of new fighters to the game in the time since its launch, with the most recent free update featuring Jack Della Maddalena, Erin Blanchfield, and Brandon Royval arriving just last week. For more on our thoughts on EA Sports UFC 4, check out our review here.\nWe'll learn more about EA Sports UFC 5 in September, but in the meantime, what do you hope is fixed, improved upon, or included in the next game?

          "description": "EA has announced that a Black Panther game is in the works. The title is being made by Cliffhanger Games, a new triple-A studio based in Seattle, in collaboration with Marvel Games.\nThe upcoming title is billed as a single-player story-driven third-person action-adventure game. In a press release, Cliffhanger states that “Our mission is to build an expansive and reactive world that empowers players to experience what it is like to take on the mantle of Wakanda’s protector, the Black Panther.”\nCliffhanger is led by Kevin Stephens, formerly of Monolith Productions (a studio currently making a Wonder Woman game), and consists of veteran talent who have worked on titles such as Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, God of War, Halo Infinite, and Call of Duty, among others. The team is still being assembled and is actively hiring. As such, this untitled Black Panther project is very early in development, so it will be a few years before it’s in our hands. \n“We’re dedicated to delivering fans a definitive and authentic Black Panther experience, giving them more agency and control over their narrative than they have ever experienced in a story-driven video game. Wakanda is a rich SuperHero sandbox, and our mission is to develop an epic world for players who love Black Panther and want to explore the world of Wakanda as much as we do,” said Kevin.\nBlack Panther made his comic debut in July 1966, and today’s news coincides with the character’s 57th anniversary. Although he’s been a playable character in numerous Marvel titles, he’s never starred in his own solo game until now. However, it's not the only upcoming game to let players assume the Black Panther mantle. Last year, Amy Hennig's Skydance New Media announced it’s making a Marvel game set during World War II starring Captain America, Black Panther Azzuri (the grandfather of T’Challa), alongside another Wakandan spy and Howling Commando member Gabriel Jones. \nTo keep up with other upcoming superhero games, we've made a list of them for you to check out here.",

Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist). \nBanjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey. \nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

          "description": "Sonic the Hedgehog co-creator Yuji Naka has been given a suspended prison sentence for insider trading.\nNews of this sentencing comes from IGN (via IGN Japan), which reports that the 57-year-old was \"found guilty of violating Japan's Financial Instruments and Exchange Act\" for insider trading after a July 7 court appearance at the Tokyo District Court. The judge in the case gave Naka a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence but suspended for four years, and two fines of 2 million yen and 170 million yen (approximately $14,000 and $1.1 million respectively). \nThis sentencing comes roughly a month after Abema Times reported in June that prosecutors on the case were asking that Naka go to prison for two years and six months and fines totaling roughly $1.2 million. However, Naka's defense asked that this fine and prison sentence be reduced. The final verdict arrived on July 7 in Japan. \nNaka, who also directed Balan Wonderworld, was arrested in November in connection to an insider trading investigation centered around a new Dragon Quest game. Naka was accused of purchasing 10,000 shares worth 2.8 million yen (roughly $20,000) in Aiming, the company behind that new mobile Dragon Quest game. \nLess than a month later, Naka was arrested once more on a second charge of insider trading; this time involving the now-defunct mobile battle royale, Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier. Naka was accused of purchasing 120,000 shares in Ateam, the developer behind the game, for approximately 144.7 million yen (more than $1 million). \nNaka has now been formally charged and sentenced for insider trading. \n[Source: IGN via IGN Japan]",

The following year, at The Game Awards 2021, Bokeh revealed Slitterhead. Thanks to a new development diary released today, we can peek at more early-development gameplay in action. \nMost of the video focuses on the developers working on Slitterhead, with a particular look at user tests and gameplay feedback. However, sprinkled throughout the diary are new clips of Slitterhead, ranging from training room-esque encounters, some clips of a neon-lit Chinese city, and even a dog that appears to be playable. \nCheck it out for yourself: \n\n\nAs you can see in the small and often blurred snippets of Slitterhead gameplay, the studio's debut game continues to look grotesque. We see a character attack enemies using Wolverine-like claws, guns, and more. Oh, and below is that playable dog: \nIn 2020, the studio said its debut horror game would be released in 2023. But there's no word on whether the team still anticipates releasing it this year.

That gets remedied a bit with the announcement that Stadium Stampede is hitting the game in an upcoming free update. \nStadium Stampede sees up to 30 wrestlers compete in a free-for-all inside a giant empty stadium. Like the real-life version, insanity is the name of the game, as players can assault each other using whatever is around them, whether it's chairs, tee shirt guns, Molotovs, golf carts, or even ride atop a horse. The last competitor standing wins, and the reveal trailer sells how much of a goofy mess it’s going to be (in a good way, hopefully). \n\n\nUnfortunately, there's no release date for this update other than that it's coming soon. AEW: Fight Forever has other DLC heading its way in the form of downloadable wrestler packs. FTR (Dax Harwood and Cash Wheeler) were added last month, and a pack containing Keith Lee and The Bunny becomes available on July 25.

His parents did nothing, he says. They just laughed.\nDecades later, he found himself trying to re- create the experience in Silent Hill: Shattered Memories.\nNowadays, Barlow is known for making Her Story and founding the studio Half Mermaid, developer of Telling Lies and Immortality. In 2009, however, he was working at Climax Studios on Silent Hill and became obsessed with making characters slightly hairy and having them run on all fours. Simultaneously, he had the teamʼs level designers build a segment where youʼd run through a swimming pool. Read more...",

While wearing a Yoshi costume, no less.\n“The head was vacuum-formed, but Yoshi’s whole body was solid foam,” adds Kathy Lawrence, the costume designer responsible for creating the mascots for dozens of Nintendo’s TV spots in the ʼ90s and 2000s.\n“It went from a costume that weighed about 35 pounds to over 200 pounds,” Fireball says. “The foam, like a sponge, just absorbed the water, and I just started to sink.” Mistaking his outreached hand for a thumbs up, Kathy and the crew were excited as they watched her husband fight for his life underwater.

          "description": "If Ubisoft's summer showcase was any indication, it's going all-in on Assassin's Creed. But a recent report from Kotaku suggests that the company's commitment to the franchise might be going even deeper than we thought; Ubisoft has recently begun the process of remaking Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. \nThe remake is currently in \"its earliest stages,\" Kotaku reports, so details are scarce, and we won't be seeing it officially for a few years. A team at Ubisoft Singapore, a branch that has contributed to almost every mainline Assassin's Creed game, is said to be heavily involved. Most notably, Ubisoft Singapore worked on the creation of naval combat for Assassin's Creed III and IV, a success that would place it at the head of development for Ubisoft's naval-focused game, Skull and Bones. Of course, Skull and Bones is now notorious for its years of repeated delays – fans of Black Flag will just have to hope the seas will be calmer for the studio's next project.\n\n\nBlack Flag was released in 2013 on the eve of a new console generation, coming to PS3 and 360, but also to PS4, Xbox One, and Wii U. The game follows Edward Kenway – the pirate grandfather of the protagonist Connor from Assassin's Creed III – as he plunders the Caribbean and stumbles into the Assassin Brotherhood. Combining the series' classic stealth gameplay with naval exploration and combat, it's widely regarded as one of the franchise's best entries. Check out our review here.\n[Source: Kotaku]\nAre you interested in a remake of Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag? Let us know in the comments!",

Instead, the acronym is confusingly shorthand for Reach for the Moon.

As a strange humanoid creature, you’ll explore a labyrinthian H.R. Giger-inspired alien world to unravel its mysteries.

And now we know that game is Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth. As the name suggests, it takes place in 2033, which puts it between the original film and its sequel, Blade Runner 2049. Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth takes place in a dystopian Los Angeles like its cinematic predecessors, and the game's events occur after the Blackout hits. \nNot much else was revealed about the game, but you can check out its moody cinematic trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, this game looks very Blade Runner, and we can't wait to learn more about it. Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth's development is led by game director Chelsea Hash, who previously served as the director of Solar Ash and technical art lead on What Remains of Edith Finch. \nAnnapurna Interactive says Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth is the first new Blade Runner game for consoles and PC in development in 25 years. It's due out sometime in the future on consoles and PC, but there's no word on when to expect it.

It looks great – we quite enjoyed playing it recently during Summer Game Fest 2023 – and you can check it out for yourself below in the newest Thirsty Suitors trailer: \n\n\nAs you can see, players take on the role of protagonist Jala, who, after a bad breakup, returns to her hometown. There, she must confront her exes and try to reconcile with them, please her tough-to-please parents, and mend broken friendships in time for her sister's wedding. To do all that, Jala will skateboard, take part in turn-based combat seemingly inspired by Persona and Pokémon, cook meals with her parents, and more. \nThirsty Suitors hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC via Steam on November 2. \nAre you going to check out Thirsty Suitors this November?

Ever since 2004, EA Sports' annualized Madden NFL series has been the exclusive franchise for the NFL, its teams, stadiums, and players. The result was the closure of other franchises, such as the competitive NFL 2K series, as well as the arcade-focused NFL Blitz franchise (which was later acquired by EA in 2011). The recently announced Wild Card Football from Saber Interactive, part of the Playgrounds franchise, hopes to smash through the established line to give players a fresh 7-on-7 arcade-facing take on the sport starring their favorite players.\nWild Card Football doesn't possess the NFL license, but rather the NFLPA license.

          "description": "While game delays have become commonplace, the opposite is extremely rare. Today, we learned Baldur's Gate 3 is somehow doing both at the same time. Initially planned for August 31, developer Larian Studios is advancing the PC release date to August 3 while delaying the PS5 version to September 6. According to the most recent community update, the change was done to prioritize release in order of platform readiness. More specifically, the team needed a little more time to get the PS5 version up to 60 frames per second.\n\"The PlayStation 5 version will be released roughly a week later than its originally scheduled date of August 31st,\" the community update reads. \"Baldur’s Gate 3 is targeting 60 frames-per-second and we’re close to achieving that on the platform but need a bit more extra time. We don’t want to compromise on quality, and feel it would be a shame to downscale to 30fps or make other compromises to hit an arbitrary date.\"\nMeanwhile, the PC version has moved up a whopping four weeks. Larian says, \"This means the PC version of Baldur’s Gate 3 will be released at a time where you’ll have more time to play it,\" likely in reference to the release of Starfield, Bethesda's massive upcoming open-world RPG. By releasing their game over a month earlier, it's a little less likely that gamers would have to choose one or the other to devote their time to.\nThe community update also casts a light cantrip on some of the features coming to the full game, including new spells, the addition of feats, the Half-Orc and Dragonborn races, the monk class, and a huge line-up of new subclasses, which you can see listed below.\nFor more Baldur's Gate 3, check out its Summer Game Fest trailer that revealed Jason Issacs' role in the game.",

While worldbuilding can be as simple as creating fictional characters and cities, some creators dive in deeply, crafting pantheons of gods, hundreds of years of wars and conflict, and even entire languages. While it makes the world more believable, it can be incredibly disorienting for an audience to be thrust headfirst into a sea of unfamiliar proper nouns, especially before they have a chance to get to know the world's characters.

Today is the day I removed the last few DNS entries pointing to AWS’s DNS servers, and I am proud to mention that (almost) all traffic is now routed via Cloudflare (and we aren’t even receiving sponsoring to say so). In this post I want to take you with me why this migration was needed, what the benefits are, and why you possibly care. But in short summary: (Much) smaller monthly bill as AWS charges insane amounts for bandwidth. Faster download speeds for you (ranging from the in-game content service to downloading the game from our website). Easier maintainability of our infrastructure with thanks to Pulumi.
