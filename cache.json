Utilising the same principles as Dark Forces, Nightdive’s latest project breathes fresh air into the Any Channel-developed FPS which debuted on 3DO, modernising it in all the right ways while maintaining a respectable level of authenticity.\nWe should stress right from the start, though: this is a weird game, and it won’t be for everybody. The Dark Forces Remaster was based on an already well-known title, and even if you hadn’t played the original, it was crammed full of recognisable imagery from the Star Wars franchise to help ease you into the old-school experience.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "The video game equivalent of Limp Bizkit.\nFans of unconventional narrative-driven games may be familiar with Hypnospace Outlaw, a cool project from a few years ago that aimed to simulate an alternate take on the social environment of the late '90s internet. Though Hypnospace Outlaw will be receiving a proper sequel with the upcoming Dreamsettler, Tendershoot decided to give waiting players a more unconventional spin-off release that takes things in a much different direction. Dubbed Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengeance of the Slayer, this classic-style boomer shooter launched on PC and Xbox in 2023 and sort of bears some narrative connections to Hypnospace Outlaw. It’s a decent game in its own right, and even though it didn’t manage to ‘wow’ us, we’d still suggest you give it a look.\nThe story of Slayers X is rather fascinating, as there are essentially two levels to it. On the first, you have the premise: this is the in-universe game that Zane Lofton from Hypnospace Outlaw referenced. He essentially designed this with the help of a friend, so the experience you’re ultimately getting with Slayers X is something an immature, horny teenager would make if he was given free rein to express himself. This leads to the second narrative level, the ‘in-game’ plot. You play the role of “Big Z”, an X-Slayer in-training who is forced into action when the monstrous Psyko Sindikate attacks his town, kills both his mom and mentor, and kidnaps one of his fellow X-Slayers. He thus sets out on a quest for revenge, blowing up a whole lot of baddies along the way as he fights to free his friend.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Will the finished product resemble GTA to some degree? I imagine yes. Am I happy about this? Yeah, go on then.\nRead more",

Qualified hoorays for that, as well as for the fact that it doesn’t make especially mad demands of your hardware: besides netting a Steam Deck Playable badge from Valve, its minimum PC specs only list the likes of the Intel Core i5-6600 and Nvidia’s GTX 1060. Easily doable, for most aspiring galactic admirals.\nOnce a battle gets underway, however, Homeworld 3’s performance can start tanking, turning an initially smooth engagement into a more stutter-prone light show. The good news? You can more than double your framerates with a relatively small handful of graphics setting changes, even if some these (including the DLSS and FSR 2 upscalers) can be a tad inconsistent in their own right.\nRead more",

In moments like that, the passion is endearing. But in other places, it is overwhelming.

          "description": "Look, you've had 15 years to play that well-regarded time-bending puzzler sitting in your Steam library, staring at you this whole time. Well, now you can have another 15 years. Braid Anniversary Edition is out on Steam now, a high definition remastering of a classic indie. It got stuck in time following a few delays but it's finally defrosted now. The sharper look will appeal to pixel perfectionists, but there are also 40 new levels for serial rewinders. And - for those interested in the thought processes of designer Jonathan Blow - a bunch of developer commentary.\nRead more",

He's a vampire doing therapy for other vampires, while also undergoing therapy, as a vampire, from another therapist (who is a vampire). Vampire Therapist! I've been able to get to grips with a playable preview - I'd say I got my teeth into it, but I'm not that much of a hack fraud - which means I got to see some of the things that creative director Cyrus Nemati told me about in our interview in action. I remain optimistic that, on it's release on June 18th, Vampire Therapist can walk the tricky line it's drawn for itself.  \r\n\nIt's balancing on a knife point of humour, the supernatural, and sincerity about mental health, the latter using real cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT; the comments the first time I wrote about Vampire Therapist revealed a lot about our readership) concepts in consultation with licensed therapists. The preview only covered Sam's first meeting with his mentor, Andromachos, and the first client Sam treats himself - a doctor called Drayne, simultaneously self-loathing and self-aggrandising - but it gave a flavour of how the game plays. Rather than a sort of janky template on how to self-therapise, as I'd feared, when you're playing Vampire Therapist it operates more as a sort of language puzzle against different types of theatre kids.\nRead more",

But I've sampled enough to know that adding a \"Misery Mode\" to the game is sort of like upending a bucket of water over a drowning person. More misery in The Long Dark? Oh thank god, that's just what this notoriously easygoing wilderness adventure has been missing. And what's this, developers Hinterland are introducing a new predator, the Cougar, which will move into any area you're fond of and compete over territory. Finally, a bit of friction for what has previously been a stroll in the woods.\r\n\n\r\nIt's not all misery. In a first for The Long Dark, which has hitherto been a permadeath game that wipes your save between runs, the devs are working on an optional Cheat Death system. It's not as cheaty as it sounds, however. You can only return from the grave four times, and each time, you'll have to make unspecified trade-offs. The idea is to stop people backing up their saves and make failure more of an adventure or if you prefer, an agonisingly slow decline, rather than letting players avoid the consequences of their actions.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Greek god pulverizing simulator Hades 2 is getting its first patch \"later this month\", say the developers. Two things are on their to-tweak list. First, something might change about the way resource gathering tools are used (the pickaxe you use to mine silver during a run, for example). Second, and perhaps more significant, is an upcoming change to the way Melinoë's dash and sprint work. We don't know exactly what that change is but, according to Supergiant, it has something to do with your witchy batterer's \"distinct style\". \nRead more",

Up next, it seems, is the artist formally known as Assassin's Creed: Codename Red. All we knew about red was that it would be set in feudal Japan, something fans have been clamouring for for literal years. Now we know that it's an AC game set in feudal Japan called Assassin's Creed Shadows, and it's getting an \"official cinematic world premiere trailer\" debut on YouTube tomorrow, at 5pm BST.\nAlso, because this sort of thing seems to always happen with Ubi, the placeholder text for said YouTube premiere might have accidentally leaked the release date for the game as November 15, 2024.\nRead more",

          "description": "Former Microsoft senior PR manager Brad Hilderbrand has blogged about the recent closure of Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin, making a familiar case that Microsoft’s gaming division are now expected “to cut expenses to the bone” in the wake of the wildly expensive acquisition of Activision Blizzard and amid slowing growth of the Game Pass subscription business. In Hilderbrand’s view, Game Pass will likely never be sustainable or profitable. Microsoft’s only chance on this front, he says, is “to put all the world's biggest games on the service” – namely, Call of Duty, which still earns hundreds of millions annually in direct sales, or GTA 6, which, hahahaha.\r\n\n \nRead more",

You briefly meet Orpheus in the base game while playing as leatherclad muse Grace, finding him moping in the underworld, eyes dripping with glam rock mascara. In the DLC he makes a musical comeback on earth, alongside messenger god Hermes. I've not stumbled on Orpheus in the other mythical game of this season, Hades 2 (he showed up in the first Hades but there's no sign he's reappearing in the sequel). So it looks like fans of the ancient Greek sadboi will have to flock to Summerfall's expansion when it comes out this summer.\nRead more",

I confess, I found this response annoying - partly because I was hoping Johanas would bring up some obscure indie composer I could then namecheck at parties, and partly, because I have spent years waiting for Tango to escape Mikami's shadow after essentially announcing themselves as a Mikami fan project back in 2010. \r\n\n \nRead more",

This is because he studied Classics.\nI won't tell you how many years its been since he was at university, but for many years - and still sort of now, to be honest - \"liking Apollo\" was a key part of his personality.

Pro účast je potřeba vyplnit registrační formulář.\r\n\r\nNe-konference neznamená, že se organizátorům nechce připravovat program, ale naopak dává prostor všem pozvaným, aby si program sami složili z toho nejzajímavějšího, čím se v poslední době zabývají nebo co je oslovilo. Obsah, který vytváří všichni účastníci, se skládá z desetiminutových prezentací a delších workshopů s převážně vývojářskou tématikou od devops, přes datové struktury, nástroje, jazyky, zkušenosti s automatizací testů a různé zajímavosti ze světa IT.\r\n\r\nPokud chcete nasát atmosféru minulých ročníků či ohodnotit kvalitu přednášek, navštivte náš YouTube kanál. Nejoblíbenější z nich právě překonala 22 tisíc shlédnutí.\r\n\r\nCo je potřeba udělat, abyste se mohli zúčastnit? Připravit si desetiminutovou prezentaci na libovolné téma, která má potenciál oslovit ostatní přítomné. Historicky proběhlo i několik velmi zajímavých nevývojářských témat, takže ani výletu do úplně jiného oboru není třeba se nikterak bránit.",

Here are some initial benchmarks of the AMD Ryzen 5 8400F in putting it up against 230+ benchmarks under Linux while also monitoring the CPU power consumption and comparing it to Intel's closest contender as the Core i5 1440F that retails for just under $200.",

          "description": "The M16 was one of the worst weapons in MW2, and nothing changed in MW3 to make the assault rifle worth using either. However, a new aftermarket part finally vaults the M16 into meta conversations. \n\n\nPlayers unlock the JAK Patriot conversion kit by completing all Season 3 Week 7 challenges, transforming the M16 from a three-round burst into a fully automatic weapon. By sacrificing damage and suffering a small loss in accuracy, the M16 garners more attention with fully automatic capabilities. The time-to-kill potential of 299ms is above average for the class, and the M16 can kill enemies in five shots up to 40 meters, which is impressive. \n\n\nHowever, the TTK suffers a massive drop-off after that distance, so players shouldn't try to use this weapon in anything longer than a mid-range gunfight. With that being said, here is the best set of attachments to use. \n\n\nBest M16 JAK Patriot loadout in MW3\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\n\nMuzzle: Komodo Heavy \n\n\nUnderbarrel: FTAC SP-10 Angled Grip \n\n\nOptic: JAK Glassless Optic \n\n\nRear Grip: Sakin ZX Grip \n\n\nConversion Kit: JAK Patriot \n\n\n\nThe M16 with the JAK Patriot equipped suffers from a hard recoil that is sharp to the left and straight up. So, our loadout focuses on improving horizontal recoil to mitigate that issue. The Komodo Heavy Barrel, FTAC SP-10 Angled Grip, and Sakin ZX Grip all improve a combination of horizontal and vertical recoil, gun kick, or firing aim stability.  \n\n\nEven with this set of attachments, the M16's recoil will be noticeable. Thankfully, it's a predictable pattern, so players should have no issue pulling down on the right stick and mowing down enemies easily. Other ARs might still be better on paper, but it's refreshing to finally have an M16 worth using after two years of irrelevance.\n\nThe post Best M16 JAK Patriot loadout in MW3 appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, in March, Kotaku reported that the title could be delayed to 2026 as development was allegedly falling behind. Those concerns were exacerbated when Rockstar Games reportedly asked employees to return to the office for five days a week, signaling something might have gone wrong in the development process. \n\n\nBloomberg's Jason Schreier, who broke the story, acknowledged those concerns and claimed \"employees are not thrilled\" with Rockstar's decision. \n\n\nImage via Rockstar Games\n\n\nEven in light of those hiccups, the recent earnings call should help extinguish any concerns about a potential delay. However, we still only have one trailer to go on for any concrete information about the title.

          "description": "The team at Statera Studio previously showed their love for classic 2D fighting games with Pocket Bravery. Now they're taking that expertise and throwing in some platform fighter inspiration for Shield Strike, a four-player brawler that's currently eyeing a 2025 launch. \n\n\nIn a setup that will be familiar to anyone who has played a fighter like Super Smash Bros. or MultiVersus, Shield Strike puts players in two-dimensional arenas full of platforms and plenty of items to use and mayhem to cause. True to its title, the hook here has combatants using their shields as projectiles, and you can see a sample in Statera's reveal trailer below. \n\n\n\n\nShield Strike currently has plans for eight playable characters, and up to four players can get in on the action in both versus and cooperative modes. There's also a story mode that unravels more of what's going on in this medieval fantasy world, complete with a bunch of enemies and five boss battles. \n\n\nWith a match-start countdown timer that ends in \"MURDER,\" Shield Strike aims to deliver the kind of fast-paced, frantic action fans of the sub-genre have come to expect. The shield mechanics certainly have my interest piqued, but what I really want to see are more of those obstacles and other means of disruption. I don't fancy myself a competitive platform fighter player by any means. I play Smash for the chaos. If Shield Strike can harness that level of borderline frustrating unpredictability in its versus battles, count me in. \n\n\nWhile we wait for a more concrete launch date, Shield Strike is currently in the works for PC and a Steam page is live for wishlisting.  \n\nThe post Pocket Bravery devs take on 2D platform fighters with Shield Strike, coming in 2025 appeared first on Destructoid.",

On Twitter, JGOD showed that the box had a letter K, a bolt-into-action label, and a car with 98 on its door, essentially confirming that the KAR98K will be in the new update. Based on the Season 3 Battle Pass, Season 4 will likely start on Wednesday, May 29.\n\n\nImage via Activision \n\n\nActivision usually releases a blog post for MW3 and Warzone with initial details about the next update one week before a new season starts, so players should expect more news soon. In saying that, the Kar98k is already a noteworthy addition worth paying attention to. Modern Warfare 3's iteration of Warzone improved one-shot sniping by removing the explosive ammunition requirement. Without needing to use the ammunition type that drastically decrease bullet velocity to get a one-shot kill, sniper rifles dominate the battle royale and are capable of taking out enemies from impressive ranges. \n\n\nDuring Warzone Pacific in 2021, the Kar98k was widely regarded as one of the best, if not the best, weapons to use on Caldera. If the bolt-action sniper rifle can one-shot kill enemies in Season 4, there's no doubt that the Kar98k will be a must-use weapon. Because even though the MORS is arguably the best sniper rifle in Warzone right now, the KAR98k will have better mobility and aim-down sight speeds. It will all come down to how far away the new weapon can kill enemies. \n\nThe post Looks like the Kar98k is set to return in MW3 and Warzone Season 4 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "With the release of XDefiant gradually approaching, many players are starting to gear up for its highly anticipated launch. But you may wonder: When do XDefiant preloads start? Here's everything you need to know. \n\n\nXDefiant preload and launch times\n\n\nYou can check out the preload and official launch times for XDefiant here:\n\n\nRegions\nPre-Load Times\nLaunch Times\n\n\n\n\nUS and Canada\nMay 16 at 10 a.m. PT/12 p.m. CT/1 p.m. ET\nMay 21 at 10 a.m. PT/ 12 p.m. CT/1 p.m. ET\n\n\nEurope\nMay 16 at 6 p.m. BST/7 p.m. CEST\nMay 21 at 6 p.m. BST/7 p.m. CEST\n\n\nOceania and Asia\nMay 17 at 3 a.m. AET\nMay 22 at 3 a.m. AET\n\n\nSouth America\nMay 16 at 2 p.m. BRT\nMay 21 at 2 p.m. BRT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach region includes all platforms, such as Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. It's also part of Ubisoft Connect, a free service hub for various games. For Steam users, check out our guide on whether or not it will be on this platform. \n\n\nFortunately, XDefiant is a free-to-play game, so no need to break out your wallet. There may still be in-game purchases, though, with premium Battle Pass items. \n\n\nImage via Ubisoft\n\n\nIf you're one of the players who already have a previous version of the game installed, it's crucial to check for an update. This simple step will ensure a smooth transition to XDefiant's official release. It will work like other preloads, where you can only play it on launch day. \n\n\nHow many gigabytes is XDefiant?\n\n\nThanks to the specs announcement and preload reload release, we know that XDefiant requires the following storage space: \n\n\n\nPC: 35GB\n\n\nPS5: 30.09GB\n\n\nXbox Series X|S: 29 GB\n\n\n\nCompared to other first-person shooter file sizes, XDefiant's storage space is relatively small, which should come as a relief. This means there may not be a need to clear any space. Additionally, those who downloaded XDefiant beforehand should only need a little space for the new update. \n\nThe post When can you preload XDefiant? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Activision has announced on its blog today that it is forming Elsewhere Entertainment, a new studio that will focus on a new narrative-based “genre-defining” AAA franchise. We don’t know what that franchise will be, nor what genre it will be defining, but we do know it will be headquartered in Warsaw, Poland.\n\n\nActivision states that the developer will be “built from the ground up” and will establish “an environment that inspires bold and diverse ideas.” The team will consist of “storytelling experts” who have worked on such franchises as “The Last of Us, Uncharted, The Witcher, Cyberpunk, Destiny, Tom Clancy’s The Division, and Far Cry.” That’s a lot of storytelling experts.\n\n\nIt’s hard not to be cynical about a studio established by a company whose parent just shut down a handful of talented studios. It sounds like, “Why are you buying a Mercedes when you just defaulted on your last car loan?”\n\n\n“Elsewhere is opening its search for best-in-class talent from across the industry,” the release says. Yeah, I think you might know a few people who are now looking for work.\n\n\nI know that it’s never quite that simple, but it just seems really galling for Activision to trumpet its founding of a AAA studio so soon while Microsoft keeps making huge cuts across its subsidiaries.\n\n\nHopefully, Elsewhere Entertainment will do well. I don’t know what “narrative-based” means to an executive and “genre-defining” is nothing but PR speak, but at least I don’t see the words “live service.”\n\nThe post Activision announces new studio, Elsewhere Entertainment, to make a narrative-based AAA franchise appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Grand Theft Auto VI's reveal last December sent fans into a tizzy, but its then-distant 2025 release window immediately tempered that excitement. While the launch seemed more in reach now that we’re nearly midway through 2024, it appears we’ll have to wait another full year before playing it.\nPublisher Take-Two released its 2024 year-end financial report today (thanks, PC Gamer), in which it states that Rockstar is targeting a Fall 2025 release window for GTA VI. This timing is reiterated in a calendar of the publisher’s 2025 releases, posted below.\nRegarding GTA VI, Take-Two states, “We are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase.” The game is slated to release for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. A PC version has yet to be mentioned. \nGrand Theft Auto VI takes players to a modern-day Vice City (the franchise's parody of Miami, FL) and stars two protagonists, a female inmate named Lucia and her still-unnamed criminal male partner. To say anticipation is high would be an understatement; the premiere trailer garnered over 100 million views in only 24 hours, breaking a YouTube record. \nAs we continue the long wait for Grand Theft Auto VI’s launch, check out our video of Game Informer’s two resident Florida Men reacting to the debut trailer. You can also read about Take-Two's recent closure of developers Roll7 (Rollerdrome, OlliOlli World) and Intercept Games (Kerbal Space Program 2).",

          "description": "Ghost of Tsushima, specifically the Director's Cut, is out on PC today. It's a fantastic game that should be welcomed with open arms as it makes its way to a new platform, but we were specifically curious about how it performs on Steam Deck. The game is not Steam Deck verified primarily because certain features are not supported on Valve's handheld, or other comparable mobile PC game platforms. However, the offline content (the single-player campaign and the expansion) has been specifically adjusted to play well on Steam Deck. You can read port studio Nixxes Software explanation here. And spending a little time with the game shows that the single-player campaign does, in fact, play well on Steam Deck. It's not without its shortcomings – a high-end PC or a PlayStation 5 are still the best ways to play the game – but Steam Deck appears to be a great way to play the game if that's your only option or you want a portable version.\nYou can check out some gameplay with commentary from myself and Wesley LeBlanc below.\n\n\nHead to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

While the company has yet to publicly address the closures directly, Xbox president Sarah Bond said in an interview that the closures were about keeping the business healthy in the long-term. It's why news of this new studio might be surprising, given one week ago, the parent company of Activision was closing studios to cut costs. \n\n\n\"Built from the ground up, Elsewhere Entertainment is a premier and standalone studio dedicated to establishing an environment that inspires bold and diverse ideas,\" a blog post reads. \"The team's underlying mission encourages everyone to explore and collaborate creatively to craft a franchise with an enduring legacy that resonates far beyond games. [The] new studio has full access to Activision's resources and tools as it continues to increase production and development. \n\"Elsewhere is opening its search for best-in-class talent from across the industry and around the world to help create a state-of-the-art and next generation gaming experience.\" \nElsewhere is currently made up of developers with experience working on franchises like The Last of Us, Uncharted, The Witcher, Cyberpunk 2077, Destiny, Tom Clancy's The Division, and Far Cry. \nWhat kind of game do you hope Elsewhere makes?

The game has only been available in PC Early Access since April 26, meaning it achieved this milestone in only three weeks.\nPublisher Hooded Horse announced the sales account for Steam, Epic, GOG, and the Microsoft Store (where Manor Lords is also playable through PC Game Pass). The game quickly caught fire, selling 1 million copies a day after launch. Since then, Manor Lords has enjoyed a consistently high concurrent player count, peaking at 173,000 on Steam in its first weekend.  \n\n\nManor Lords is being developed by Slavic Games and puts players in the shoes of a medieval lord tasked with building and growing a city. Players manage their city’s community, infrastructure, economy, and defense/expansion, the latter of which unfold as large-scale tactical battles. The intricate social and production systems combined with an ever-changing world (complete with seasonal and weather changes) result in an organic metropolis that players have taken to in a big way. \nManor Lords joins Early Access hits this year, such as Palworld and Hades II. The game’s 1.0 launch is currently up in the air as the game continues to change and improve based on player feedback. It’s off to a great start, though, and we’re curious to see how it evolves throughout its EA period.",

The company did so after word online spread that Shadows requires a mandatory online connection to play the game. \nFollowing the reveal of Shadows yesterday, which showcased the dual samurai and shinobi protagonists we'll be controlling in 16th-century feudal Japan, people noticed wording in preorder listings and elsewhere that seemingly pointed to the game requiring an always-online connection. This frustrated fans of the series, especially given Shadows, like its recent predecessors, is a single-player game. However, that's not the case and Ubisoft released a statement today to clear the air. \n\n\n\"Hey everyone, we wanted to share some of the early information on the upcoming launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows, following some questions we've noticed in the community,\" the statement reads. \"Assassin's Creed Shadows will not require a mandatory connection at all times. An online connection will be needed to install the game, but you will be able to play the entire journey offline, and explore Japan without any online connection. \n\n\"We are super excited to bring Assassin's Creed to Feudal Japan on November 15 when the game releases, and we cannot wait to show you more along the way.\" \n\nAs you can see, it's clear Shadows is a game you can play offline, but only after connecting to the internet once to actually install the RPG. \nAssassin's Creed Shadows hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Amazon Luna, PC (via the Ubisoft Store and Epic Games Store), and Mac (with Apple silicon via the Mac App Store) on November 15.\nFor more, check out what we learned yesterday during the Shadows reveal, and then read Game Informer's ranking of the entire Assassin's Creed series.\nHow do you feel about needing internet to install Assassin's Creed Shadows?

          "description": "Ubisoft has canceled The Division Heartland. First announced in 2021, the game was a free-to-play spin-off of The Division franchise developed by Red Storm Studio.\nUbisoft revealed the cancelation in an earnings report, stating,\n“As part of Ubisoft’s efforts to streamline its operations and adapt to evolving market trends, there have been further reorganizations within the Global Publishing teams, both at the APAC region, that is not organized into three engagement hubs, and at the central level. Additionally, in line with the increased selectivity of its investments, Ubisoft has decided to stop development on The Division Heartland and has redeployed resources to bigger opportunities such as XDefiant and Rainbow Six.”\n\n\nThe Division Heartland had been quiet for some time after its reveal, including being delayed. It eventually resurfaced with closed beta tests, but scarce updates on its existence caused doubt and confusion among fans. The game was billed as a PvEvP survival action experience with players controlling a Division agent tasked with protecting a small town from enemy factions and chemical contamination. \nDespite the cancellation, we know it doesn't mean the end of the franchise. Ubisoft announced The Division 3 last September, with series creator Massive Entertainment back at the helm. That game currently has no release window. \nHeartland joins an expanding graveyard of canceled Ubisoft projects over the past few years. In January 2023, the publisher canceled its upcoming team-based arena battler Project Q and three other games in development. In 2022, the battle royale Ghost Recon Frontline, Splinter Cell VR, and two unannounced games were also axed. An unannounced sequel to Immortals Fenix Rising was also reportedly scrapped last July.",

As many speculated, Shadows puts players in control of Japan's first African samurai, Yasuke (a real historical figure), and a female shinobi character, Naoe. It will be released on November 15.\nThis dual protagonist approach isn't too surprising given it's Ubisoft Quebec developing the game – it did the same with Kassandra and Alexios in 2018's Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Jacob and Evie Frye in 2015's Assassin's Creed Syndicate – but it's exciting nonetheless.

Like Amazon's Fallout series, this Tomb Raider show will premiere exclusively on Prime Video to more than 240 countries and territories around the world. \nThis series order arrives as part of a larger deal between Amazon MGM Studios and Tomb Raider reboot developer Crystal Dynamics, which is currently working on a new Tomb Raider game in Unreal Engine 5. In December of 2022, we learned Amazon Games will publish that in-development Tomb Raider game, which Amazon describes as a \"single-player, narrative-driven adventure that will add a new chapter to Lara Croft's story in the Tomb Raider series.\" \n\"With great IP, the possibilities are endless,\" Amazon Games vice president Christoph Hartmann writes in a press release. \"The richness and depth of the fiction allows the Tomb Raider series from Prime Video and the video game from Amazon Games to tell separate stories about Lara Croft's adventures. We're honored that Crystal Dynamics has entrusted Amazon with this iconic franchise, and we're looking forward to seeing where this collaboration takes us.\" \nThis is the second upcoming TV adaptation to star the iconic treasure hunter. Netflix's animated series Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft, starring Haley Atwell, is set to premiere sometime this year. That particular show is set within the continuity of Crystal Dynamic's reboot trilogy, taking place after the events of Shadow of the Tomb Raider. \nIf you're curious about Crystal Dynamics' recent Tomb Raider reboot, you can pick up Tomb Raider: Game of the Year Edition on PC via GOG for free if you're an Amazon Prime member throughout May.

          "description": "Dungeons & Dragons has a big year ahead of it. The classic tabletop RPG is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, and the most significant event of that celebration is undoubtedly the release of a revision for the game's core rules, including the Player’s Handbook, Dungeon Master’s Guide, and Monster Manual. Backwards-compatible with the entirety of the 5th edition of the game, the new books are nonetheless a big new step forward for the game, reflecting a decade of iteration and evolution as the game has exploded in popularity.\nThe books aren’t far off. Players and Dungeon Masters alike can watch for pre-orders starting on June 18; each book is set to be priced at $49.99. Each of the three new books comes in at a hefty 384 pages apiece.\nWe had the good fortune to visit Wizards of the…",

          "description": "Sony Interactive Entertainment has revealed in its latest financial earnings report it sold 20.8 million PlayStation 5 units in the fiscal year that ended on March 31. In doing so, Sony sold more than any fiscal year since the console's launch in November 2020. However, despite that achievement, Sony still fell short of its original PS5 sales target for this year, missing it by more than 4 million units. \nOriginally targeting 25 million units for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, Sony sold 20.8 million, bringing the grand total up to 59 million, despite the 4 million units miss. As noted by VideoGamesChronicle, however, Sony revised that 25 million unit target in February to just 21 million; it still didn't hit that target, though, just narrowly missing the mark. \n\n\nAt 59 million units, the PS5 is just behind the PlayStation 4's 60 million units at the same point in its life cycle. However, Tokyo-based video game analyst Serkan Toto told VGC that 20.8 million units sold is likely going to remain the peak for the PS5, and that this number would have been much lower if not for the release of Helldivers 2 in February, which is PlayStation's fastest-selling game ever after selling 12 million copies in 12 weeks. \nOn the earnings call, Sony told investors to expect gaming sales to decrease in the fiscal year that just began (and ends March of next year) due to an expected decrease in console sales. There are also no major games from existing franchises releasing between now and then, according to the company. However, Sony says it still plans to release Concord, the new multiplayer online shooter IP from Firewalk Studios coming to PS5 and PC, this year. \nFor more about PlayStation, read about how Hermen Hulst and Hideaki Nishino have been named dual CEOs of the company, and then read Game Informer's Stellar Blade review. After that, check out Game Informer's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth review. \nHow do you feel about the PlayStation 5 at this point in its lifecycle? Let us know in the comments below!",

Midsummer Studios is a team consisting of veteran Firaxis and Maxis designers. \nMidsummer was founded by Solomon, who serves as CEO and creative director, game director Will Miller (also formerly of Firaxis), and COO/CFO Nelsie Birch, a newcomer to games with a 25-year career in financial and operations management. They’re joined by executive producer Grant Rodiek, an 18-year veteran of Maxis Studios and former producer/director on several entries of The Sims. In addition to them, the small team currently consists of six other designers.\n\n\nThe company’s debut game will be a next-gen life sim that, according to the press release, “emphasizes player-driven narratives, allowing communities to share memorable moments that grow out of the creativity of players themselves.” \n“The best stories in games are written by the players,” said Solomon in the press release. “At Midsummer we’re making a life sim focused on the drama of modern life, where our players will write meaningful stories just by playing, and then share those stories with the world.”\nMidsummer has secured a $6 million investment with several partners and is focused on growing a sustainable studio that values the health and happiness of its employees.",

It achieved this title after crossing 12 million copies sold in 12 weeks, beating out the record previously held by God of War Ragnarök, which sold 11 million copies in 10 weeks, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. \nDeveloper Arrowhead Game Studios' live-service multiplayer shooter sequel hit PlayStation 5 on February 8, with a simultaneous PC launch that same day, which is new for PlayStation. Its usual PC strategy sees PlayStation games launching on PC years after the game's console release – Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut is only just now coming to PC this month, for example. It seems launching on PC day-and-date with PS5 was the right call, though, as Helldivers 2 is now a bonafide hit for PlayStation. \n\n\nArrowhead Game Studios CEO Johan Pilestedt celebrated the news, noting there are more Helldivers 2 players than Swedes (the studio is based in Stockholm, Sweden) while thanking players for helping the team and PlayStation reach this achievement. \nAs announced in the Sony earnings call, we have sold over 12M units!\n@Helldivers2. A massive thank you to the community for your support,…\nMay 14, 2024\nNotably, Arrowhead Game Studios is independent – PlayStation published Helldivers 2 as a PS5 console exclusive, in a way previously referred to as second-party. However, given acquisitions are happening more and more this generation, it wouldn't be surprising if PlayStation attempted to bring Arrowhead Game Studios under the first-party umbrella. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Helldivers 2 review, and then read about how PlayStation recently walked back its Helldivers 2 PlayStation Network changes. \n[Source: VideoGamesChronicle]\nAre you one of the 12 million Helldivers 2 players?

Sure, other run-based indies like Balatro and Dead Cells, all-encompassing triple-A titles like Tears of the Kingdom and Super Mario Bros. Wonder, and retro compilations like Sonic Origins and TMNT: The Cowabunga Collection, have shared that title, but I always know that when I need to pass time on a flight, no game does so as effectively as Vampire Survivors. Logically, I know that each run will last, at most, 30 minutes, but for some reason, it never feels that way. And because of that, I look down for what feels like 20 minutes, and when I look up, 2 hours have passed.\nI travel a lot, so I play Vampire Survivors fairly regularly.

Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days.

This casting comes from The Hollywood Reporter, which reports that the production will begin shooting mid-summer in England. \nIneson, whom you might also know from The VVitch, The Northman, and The Creator, joins a star-studded cast for the Marvel Cinematic Universe's first film about Marvel's First Family, which features Pedro Pascal (HBO's The Last of Us) as Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic, Vanessa Kirby (Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning) as Sue Storm/Invisible Woman, Joseph Quinn (Stranger Things) as Johnny Storm/Human Torch, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach (The Bear), as Ben Grimm/The Thing. Joining Ineson is a female Silver Surfer played by Julia Garner (Ozark).\n\n\nPaul Walter Hauser (Cobra Kai) and John Malkovich (Being John Malkovich) will also appear in The Fantastic Four, although their roles are currently undisclosed. \nIf you've played FFXVI, you already know Ineson has an incredible voice, certainly perfect for the role of a massive galactic entity that devours planets; we can't wait to see what he does as Galactus when The Fantastic Four hits theaters on July 25, 2025. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Final Fantasy XVI review, and then read Game Informer's exclusive interview with Final Fantasy XVI producer Naoki Yoshida about lessons learned, Clive's reception, loose ends, and more.

While each of the four studios affected, which also included Mighty Doom developer Alpha Dog Games and Bethesda support studio Roundhouse Games, released a statement about the closures, Xbox remained silent. \nHowever, four days later, Bloomberg's Dina Bass interviewed Xbox president Sarah Bond and asked her about the Bethesda closures, to which Bond cited a desire to keep the Xbox business healthy in the long term, even through hard transition periods. \n\n\nHere's what Bond said: \nBass then asked Bond specifically about the closure of Tango Gameworks after Hi-Fi Rush, which by Xbox's own admitted metrics, was a big success. Bond's answer here was less straightforward – you can read it below in full: \nWhile it's great that Bond addressed these closures at Xbox, it still lacks the clarity you'd expect from one of the biggest companies in the games industry. Neither Microsoft nor Xbox, including Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer, has yet to address the layoffs and closures in an official capacity beyond this.\nFor more, read about how Redfall was reportedly set to receive a big offline play update this month before Xbox shut down Arkane Austin, and then read about how Xbox is reportedly considering bringing Senua's Saga: Hellblade II to PlayStation 5.

Continuing the Scarlet & Violet series is Twilight Masquerade, a set that focuses on the Teal Mask DLC of the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet video games. Because of that, players can expect locations, characters, and Pokémon from Kitakami, the folklore-rich area from the first part of the Hidden Treasure of Area Zero storyline.\nAs such, new Pokémon like Bloodmoon Ursaluna, Fezandipiti, Okidogi, Munkidori, and Sinistcha are all featured in Twilight Masquerade. However, the most common new Pokémon I encountered during my opening of several booster packs sent over by The Pokémon Company was Ogerpon; I pulled several different versions of the grass-type Legendary Pokémon from The Teal Mask. \nPokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet – Twilight Masquerade adds 226 cards, including 14 new Pokémon ex cards, more than 30 Trainer cards, and dozens of special-illustration cards. I'll always love Gen I the most, so I was happy to add new cards featuring favorites like Alakazam, Zapdos, Ninetales, and Eevee, but my absolute favorites are the special illustration versions of Applin, Sunflora, and Infernape. I also adore the Hearthflame Mask Ogerpon ex card that I was lucky enough to grab.\nYou can check out my favorite cards I pulled from booster packs below.\n\n Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet – Twilight Masquerade is available on May 24.

Announced today at LudoNarraCon, the game is getting DLC called Stray Gods: Orpheus, which follows the titular character through a new adventure. Check out the reveal trailer below.\n\n\nOrpheus (played by Rent star Anthony Rapp) appeared in the base game, but only briefly, so this expansion will give players a better idea of his backstory and personality. The trailer also features Hermes (played by Erika Ishii), though their exact role in the DLC isn't clarified. The experience is roughly two hours long with six new interactive tracks and features some returning songwriters, including Austin Wintory, Simon Hall, and Montaigne, but also adds comedic musician Tom Cardy to the mix.\nAs for the plot, the following excerpt from a press release explains what to expect. \"When the curtain has fallen and the show is over, who do you go home as?\" it reads. \"Choose to reject, embrace, or rewrite the stories the world expects of you. Is the mortal world ready for the return of Ancient Greece’s most infamous bard?\"\n\nStray Gods: Orpheus hits PC on June 27, with a console release date \"coming soon.\" For more Stray Gods, check out our feature on how it was made.

This news comes from a Bloomberg report that says employees across the Xbox organization have been told to expect more cuts. \nThese potential layoffs would follow Xbox's decision to shutter four Bethesda studios earlier this week, including Hi-Fi Rush team Tango Gameworks and Redfall developer Arkane Austin. As for the staff offered voluntary severance agreements, Bloomberg reports that producers, quality assurance testers, and other staff at ZeniMax are receiving them. \n\n\nThe publication also reports the reason Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin were shut down this week is that they were in the process of pitching new projects and hiring additional staff for said projects, something suggested by ZeniMax head Jill Braff and Xbox president Matt Booty during a town hall held this week. Xbox and ZeniMax chose to shut these studios down – both in the beginning processes of creating new games – instead of closing a studio deeper in development on projects. \nElsewhere in Bloomberg's report, which details an internal town hall held at Xbox following the studio closures this week, Booty reportedly described its studios as spread too thin, like \"peanut butter on bread,\" and that leaders across the company felt understaffed. Xbox closed three studios and had ZeniMax Online Studios absorb Roundhouse Games to free up resources. Braff said during the meeting, \"It's hard to support nine studios all across the world with a lean central team with an ever-growing plate of things to do. I think we were about to topple over.\" \nThese studio closures follow the January layoffs of 1,900 employees at Xbox, Activision Blizzard, and ZeniMax, which add to the total of more than 10,000 laid off in the games industry just this year. \n[Source: Bloomberg]\nHow do you feel about Xbox?

However, its release arrives at a rocky period for Xbox, which just shuttered four Bethesda studios, including Hi-Fi Rush team Tango Gameworks and Redfall developer Arkane Austin. As a result, Xbox players have wondered how safe Hellblade II developer Ninja Theory might be after its sequel's release, given Hi-Fi Rush was a \"break out hit\" for the company but wasn't enough to keep Tango open. \nPerhaps to help boost Hellblade II's sales, Xbox is reportedly considering bringing the game to PlayStation 5, according to The Verge. The publication's Tom Warren writes, \"I understand Hellblade II is another game that Microsoft has been considering for the PS5. If that ever happens, at this point, it's not clear if even that would be considered a success.\" \n\n\nHellblade II coming to PS5 wouldn't be out of left field, considering Xbox has brought previously exclusive games like Grounded, Sea of Thieves, and Hi-Fi Rush to PS5 this year. However, with the launch of Hellblade II happening in just a few weeks, it seems if it does come to PS5, it will be post-launch, which lines up with Xbox's strategy in this realm thus far. \nSenua's Saga: Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 21, 2024. \nFor more about the game, check out the Senua's Saga: Hellblade II PC specs and system requirements, and then read about how Senua's Saga: Hellblade II will be locked to 30 FPS on Xbox Series X/S.

The first maintenance release for OpenTTD 14 fixes a multiplayer desync bug and cleans up a few rough edges with the new ship pathfinder and the unbunching feature. As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. Download Changelog Bug tracker",
