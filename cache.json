Yes, somebody has already managed to beat the game in an eye-watering 94 minutes (thanks, VGC).\nOn the day of the game's launch, Zelda speedrunner @MrGymnast86 posted his best time on Twitter, with an any% speedrun of a little over an hour and a half. His tweet was accompanied by a video of the run in question, which we are obviously not going to add to this article on account of it showing huge portions of the game which most of us and you haven't even had the chance to play yet.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

After many years of waiting, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is finally here, letting us dive into a new (but also, kind of the same) version of Hyrule once again and get to grips with a whole bunch of fresh abilities and powers.\nOne of these abilities, Ascend, was revealed in the game's 10-minute gameplay demonstration back in March, showing us all how Link will be able to quickly get to the top of buildings, mountains and towers by effectively swimming through the ceiling. It's a pretty neat feature, to be sure, and it turns out that it actually started life as a debug code, used by the developers to swiftly leap out of a cave system when they were testing the game.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

In response, Furukawa describes the time between the two as a \"special case\", before suggesting that this is not necessarily the timeframe that the company will be applying in the future.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

You can see just how big the world is even before you land, reminding you of just how massive the previous game was.\nSomehow, Tears of the Kingdom does the impossible and makes Breath of the Wild feel like a proof of concept; it takes everything its predecessor does, improves upon every single aspect, and gives you even more freedom, an even bigger world, and tons more secrets to uncover.

          "description": "Tunic developer Andrew Shouldice has made no secret about his love of The Legend Of Zelda over the years. He's not only spoken at length about how playing the original pair of Zelda games on the NES provided ample inspiration for his crafty hack and slasher, but you can also see it right there in the game itself, from your fox hero's bright green outfit to the beautifully illustrated in-game manual you piece together to unravel the world's mysteries. \nBut speaking with Shouldice at GDC this year, I wanted to talk to him another other potential source of inspiration. Before he struck out on his own to make Tunic, Shouldice cut his teeth making hidden object games, ranging from globe-trotting mystery adventures to Atlantean-themed detective stories. On paper, this earlier work would appear to provide the perfect proving ground for Tunic, as we all know by now that it holds plenty of secrets of its own. For Shouldice, though, it was more of a reaction against his earlier work that fuelled his approach to Tunic, as he gradually came to realise his hidden object games \"weren't tapping into this very specific type of mystery and discovery and player agency and true exploration that I was interested in,\" he says.\nRead more",

          "description": "The Legend Of Zelda has always been one of my personal favourite series over the years, but being a Nintendo game, it's obviously never graced the PC in any kind of official capacity. But while we may never get to play a mainline Zelda game on PC, there's no denying it's inspired countless other developers to have a stab at it themselves, hence why we've put together this list of the best PC games like Zelda you can play right now. Whether you're looking to scratch that Tears Of The Kingdom itch or get stuck into something more retro-facing like A Link To The Past, we've got you covered. These are the best Zelda-likes on PC we'd recommend playing today.\nRead more",

It's also why I'm a little surprised how engrossing Foxhole is as a strategy game. As most players (including Brendy) will tell you, it's a game all about shuffling, ie. logistics.

          "description": "It's been a harrowing few years in our real world, and I often feel like I'm just trying to keep my own little flame of hope safe from the howling winds of indifference and despair. So Darkest Dungeon 2, a party-based dark fantasy roguelite centered on the idea of doing just that, ended up being a bit too familiar and also a bit therapeutic. Having well over a hundred hours in the first game, I was also pleasantly surprised by some of the ways this carriage-bound journey into existential dread changes up the formula… and not so much by a couple of others.\nJust like its predecessor, Darkest Dungeon 2 leads with vibes and attitude. Every bit of art and atmosphere is subtly (or not-so-subtly) menacing, worn down, and melancholic, with Wayne June's unmistakeable narration laying out the compelling story of a quest for answers that went too far. The background on how the world got this way is doled out in tiny morsels of tragic exposition after the conclusion of each run, so I always had new details to look forward to whether I won or lost. It's very clear that reality is, as they would say in the Bay Area, \"hella broken,\" and that it's somehow your fault as the nameless financier of these soul-rending expeditions into the darkness. But the nature of your crimes takes a long time to reveal itself.\nRead more",

          "description": "Every PC* needs fans, so why not pick up some of the best value options for a historic low price? Arctic's P14 140mm fans are great performers as both radiator and case fans, although they're intended primarily for the former. They've attracted strong user and critical reviews since debuting a few years back, as they offer a good balance of airflow, pressure, noise and price, and now you can pick up a five-pack for just £22 - a solid £5 off their normal cost, and the cheapest they've been since 2020. \n*OK, there are some passively cooled PCs, but most of us have at least one case or radiator fan contributing to our airflow needs! \nRead more",

          "description": "It’s funny how some aspects of game design are so ubiquitous that we stop questioning them, or even noticing them. After decades spent playing video games, I know that if I look behind the waterfall, there’s likely to be some sort of shiny goodie to collect. If I head left rather than right at the start of a level, I’m bound to find a juicy secret. There are conventions. Traditions. I can’t remember a time when games didn’t have giant lifts - and yet, I’m not entirely sure why they’re there. I’m not talking about the regular kind of lifts that you pile into, usually at the end of a level, to transition from one part of the game to another; those ones have historically been used to hide lengthy loading times, like the interminably long lifts of Mass Effect. \r\n\n\r\nWhat I mean is the lifts that are essentially tennis-court-sized moving platforms, usually with little more than a flimsy guard rail around the edge to stop elevator enjoyers from plunging down the shaft. Even more specifically, I’m talking about the diagonally moving elevators that trundle slowly into the depths, often to some nefarious laboratory. There’s a good example in the Resident Evil 2 remake, where you fight the final boss on an inclined elevator as it slowly, ever so slowly, descends towards the train that will grant your escape. So where did these giant elevators come from? And why do developers keep putting them in their games? I set out to answer both questions, and went somewhere unexpected.\r\n\n \nRead more",

They describe the game as \"fun, campy and spooky\" and hint at yet more secrets to be revealed.

Shortly before release, Valve bestowed it with Verified status for the Steam Deck, a coveted green tick that represents more or less complete compatibility and suitability for the portable PC. \nI wouldn’t normally curl an eyebrow at this sort of thing – having more great Steam Deck games is good for PC gaming – but given how all-over-the-shop Redfall’s performance is on desktop PCs, could it really settle in on the less powerful Deck? A few ambulatory vamp slaying jaunts later, I can conclude that it... maaaaaybe can. Sort of.\nRead more",

And having played the first mission of the game at GDC, I can confirm that yes, this is very much in the vein of first-person Returnal. It's a fast-paced, bullet hell shooter set on a strange alien moon where everything's out to get you, but the shift in perspective makes everything in its titular abyss feel closer and more intimate, calling to mind the frantic, confined gun fights of Doom and Quake more than Housemarque's seminal roguelike - games that creative director Benni Hill tells me were formative experiences for him growing up. \nThere's also a greater emphasis on story-telling in Luna Abyss, with Hill also citing Nier: Automata and Bioshock as other key influences. It's a compelling mix, based on the first chunk I played, and arguably one of my surprise GDC favourite demos alongside The Thaumaturge and The Lamplighters League. Indeed, Hill tells me they started working on Luna Abyss a year before Returnal was even announced, and when they first saw it during Sony's PlayStation 5 reveal stream in the summer of 2020, he and his team did a collective double-take.\nRead more",

While part of Park Beyond's selling point is making literally impossible rides via the aptly-named method of Impossification (an upgrade to rides you buy by spending units of amazement gleaned from your slack-jawed guests, in order to strap a canon to a rollercoaster), I really was not prepared for how simulation-y the simulation bits are.\nRead more",

          "description": "\"What will ye do, when steel hearts break, and courage does abscond?\" reads the penultimate line of The Pale Beyond’s poetic prologue. Actually, it’s less of a poem and more a call to action: how on earth will you keep a ragtag bunch of sailors alive in the harshest conditions on the planet? If you hadn’t already twigged, The Pale Beyond is a narrative survival sim that puts you in the frostbitten boots of First Mate aboard The Temperance - a coal guzzling steam ship that set out on a polar expedition in search of its sister, The Viscount, which went missing five years prior. As Captain Hunt’s second-in-command, you’ll take daily requests from the crew, manage the food rations, and settle petty squabbles on the poop deck.   \r\n\n\r\nBeginning life as a way for co-founders Michael Bell and Thomas Hislop to create World of Warcraft mods, Bellular Studios grew alongside its gaming and Warcraft YouTube channels into a fully-fledged development team based out of their hometown of Belfast, Northern Ireland. The Pale Beyond is their debut game that fittingly draws on Ireland’s rich maritime history, although, as Hislop tells me, this wasn’t always the plan. \"We initially didn’t set out to do so, but it quickly emerged as a core influence that we kept finding ourselves drawn back to,\" he says. \"The further we delved into the golden age of exploration, and its very local routes, the more it resonated with us personally.\"  \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "As you might expect from a roster of 12 Marvel superheroes (or 17, if you count the four extra DLC supes and its original, player-designed protagonist The Hunter), the lycra-clad buds of Marvel's Midnight Suns all look and feel substantially different from one another when it comes to combat. When Firaxis were designing the moveset for each hero, creative director Jake Solomon says he and fellow lead game designer Joe Weinhoffer would take turns being \"point designers\" for certain characters. \"Joe was point designer on one hero, I was point designer on another hero,\" Solomon says, highlighting Magic and Iron Man as two of his own favourite heroes that he designed. \nBoth are what I'd call quite technical heroes, with Magic relying on careful battlefield placement to boot enemies into nifty magical portals, while Iron Man's most powerful abilities often only come from discarding other cards. But when I ask Solomon at GDC if he thinks he has a particular design 'style' that unites his crop of Marvel heroes, he says he loves being \"bombastic\".\nRead more",

There isn't much to this one: it glows in the dark, the theme is based around some lore-specific stuff in Tears of the Kingdom, and has a Nintendo copyright on the back. The price is about in line with other similar keychains (a little lower, really), like the Kirby one that went for 600 Platinum, or the higher-priced Cat Mario keychain for 800.\nNeed Platinum Points?\nAs a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time.

According to the statement, Project Sirius now has a \"reformulated framework\" which is \"[better] aligned with [CDPR's] strategy.\" The written-off development funded is noted as being in the region of $650,000 USD.\nAs to what form Project Sirius will take, that remains known only to CDPR and the title's developer, Boston-based studio The Molasses Flood. Back in October, the project was described as having a broader scope than traditional Witcher titles, with a focus on both single and multiplayer support as well as an \"innovative\" take on the Witcher universe.\nOne element that is for sure, however, is that the new title is still a long, long way from hitting store shelves, and CDPR will remain currently focused on its long-time-coming Cyberpunk 2077 DLC, Phantom Liberty, which is still yet to confirm its (supposed) 2023 release date.\nThe post Stalled Witcher spin-off ‘Project Sirius’ is back on track appeared first on Destructoid.",

These and other issues have been bothering the GG community for an exceptionally long time, leaving the die-hard community pretty miserable while they wait for repairs.\nhttps://twitter.com/GUILTYGEAR_PR/status/1656595752976633857?s=20\nAccording to the statement, the expected rollout for these fixes is May 25, which has led some players to believe that this will probably be close to the release date of the next wave of DLC characters. After all, folks aren't gonna buy DLC for a bust game. Fixes for abnormal ping numbers, room entry crashes, and a block on uninvited players entering lobbies. The patch is said to be currently in its testing and licensing phase, but hopefully will be rolled out on all platforms before the month is out. It's been a long wait for the GG faithful, so here's hoping for a happier summer.\nGuilty Gear Strive is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

As reported by Gematsu, this collaboration was announced in Akatsuki's recently published financial report.\nNo details whatsoever were offered about the new title, but we do know that it is in production for \"next-gen\" platforms, (we're really still calling it that?), and that the companies hope to release the game before the end of the financial year. So we can, in theory, expect the game to release before March 2024.\nKoei Tecmo is, of course, famed for its handling of several popular gaming franchises, including Dynasty Warriors, Dead or Alive, Wo Long, and Ninja Gaiden. Akatsuki Games has produced licensed and original titles in all manner of genres, though the studio has more recently focused on mobile releases such as Romancing Saga Re:Universe, Dragon Ball Z: Dokken Battle, and idol-based rhythm game Uni's on Air. \nStepping up to PS5/Xbox Series X development is certainly something of a leap from producing mobile games, but one would assume that the guidance and veteran nature of Koei Tecmo will help see the developer through.

All recorded reviews so far fall into the \"Positive\" category, with only one landing in \"Mixed\" and none in \"Negative\".\nOver on OpenCritic, (as reported by VGC), the numbers are even stronger, as Tears of the Kingdom is currently the highest-rated video game of all time recorded on the platform, with a rating of 97.2, and once again beating out Super Mario Odyssey by less than a single point. Of course, these aggregates can go down, as well as up, as other reviews get added and add or subtract from the average. But, at least as of right now, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is riding high on a wave of critical success.\nIt's an undeniably impressive feat, one that practically guarantees that the long-awaited Breath of the Wild sequel will be the biggest Nintendo release, as well as one of the best-selling games, of 2023.

          "description": "The clock's tickin' dude...\nNetherrealm Studios continues to tease the reveal of the next title in its ultra-gory fighter series Mortal Kombat — Following on from the \"grain of sand\" anniversary video, a new teaser seems to suggest that the unveiling of NRS' latest is pretty much imminent.\nA short video tracks the second hand of a clock, as it ominously ticks down toward 12, (whic is, numerically, the next title in the series), however, the hand ultimately skips past 12 and jumps straight to 1. Additionally, while the clock is relatively standard-looking, the reflection in the glass shows a galaxy of grains, which is in keeping with the hourglass owned by the franchise's time-warping villain, Kronika.\nhttps://twitter.com/MortalKombat/status/1656343687352426497?s=20\nWhile there are many possible readings of the symbolism on display here, some fans suggest that skipping 12 represents a resetting of the timeline, which makes sense given the climax of Mortal Kombat 11: Aftermath. Others have opined that the clock is telling us that the new game is not Mortal Kombat 12 at all, and is either a standalone release or a non-numerical sequel/spin-off. This labyrinth of possibilities is only further complicated by a new leak from prominent spoiler bill-bilkun, who claim the new title is in development for PC and Gen 9 consoles under the title Mortal Kombat 1.\nBut, despite all this speculation, one thing's for sure: Netherrealm is getting ready to lift the lid on its next project soon. As I have previously noted, while the most recent MK timeline was certainly ambitious and even successful in the early going, the studio quickly painted itself into a corner with its interminable \"Revenants vs. PMC\" storyline. And, as such a slap of the big red reset button might be just what the franchise needs.\nIt Has Begun...

And while we can be grateful for the abandonment of those weird \"lad's mag\" years, there's definitely something of a yearning for the well (and not-so-well)-conceived commercials of the 1980s and 1990s. This was a time when context was absolutely necessary, where no answers or information could be found via a quick wander through the information superhighway.\nThe commercial had to do all the selling. No live streams, no banner ads, no YouTube previews, and no E3 visits for Johnny Public. You have 30 seconds to tell people to spend $50.

Speaking of which, the PC version also has some new graphic options, allowing for further fine-tuning of 16th-century France, and bringing all of those grisly rats and mounds of rotten meat to, erm, \"life.\" In addition, the update features a fresh round of bug fixes, which will also be applied to the Switch cloud edition.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoEwC2TxiMA&ab_channel=FocusEntertainment\nLaunching in the fall of 2022, A Plague Tale: Requiem follows the continuing odyssey of the de Rune siblings, Amicia and Hugo, as they search for a mysterious land that keeps appearing in the latter's dreams. While not quite for everybody, due to its stealth-heavy nature and oppressive and grim tone, A Plague Tale: Requiem is a fine follow-up to its 2019 predecessor, making up for its gameplay flaws with stunning visuals, interesting and engaging characters, and compelling performances.\nA Plague Tale: Requiem is available now on PS5, PC, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch via cloud.\nThe post A Plague Tale: Requiem adds Performance Mode for PS5 and Xbox Series X appeared first on Destructoid.",

You explore the town and command a slate of classic vampire powers, like turning into a bat and hypnotizing people. You use these to steal the blood of rich people. Finally, a protagonist we can root for.\nhttps://youtu.be/n-n87qBhCr8\nYour character is new to the whole vampire thing and still hasn’t made the decision on whether they should hold onto their humanity or just go with that and have a feast. That’s not a hard decision for me. The game contains themes of social conflict, alcoholism, and corruption. Hopefully, this doesn’t get too in the way of eating the rich.\nThere is no indication that romance will play a role here, but we can always hope.\nSometimes PR people will seek out journalists who fit best with the subject matter of what they’re trying to bring attention to, then they reach out to them directly. That’s what happened here. I often don’t know why they talk to me aside from “actually reports on non-AAA games,” but I totally get it with Cabernet. I can barely last 5-minutes in a polite conversation without lusting over vampires. Well played, PR person. Now I want to know if I come up in a Google search for vampire-fucker or if I’m just on a list somewhere.\nIf you, too, lust for vampires and blood, Cabernet will arrive for PC in early 2024.\nThe post Cabernet is a narrative game about eating the rich appeared first on Destructoid.",

And if you, like me, are a fan of said art, then you'll be stoked to hear that Nintendo has gathered together each and every piece, newly curated in an online gallery.\n\nThe gallery features the artwork for almost every splatfest to date, from the original Splatoon all the way through to Splatoon 3, funkily daubed by the series' long-term art director Seita Inoue.\nFrom Splatoon's Squid Sisters, Callie and Marie, through Splatoon 2 rap-rock group Off the Hook — better known as Pearl and Marina — to Splatoon 3's trinity of Shiver, Frye, and Big Man, each and every contest is accounted for. Ketchup vs. Mayo, Action vs. Comedy, Chicken vs. Egg, Movies vs. Books, and even the bizarre \"Pocky Sticks with More Chocolate vs. Pocky Sticks with Less Chocolate.\n\nAt first glance, there seems to be a lot of artwork missing but be sure to click on the links on each piece to switch out for alternates, that way you can also see some of the licensed splatfests — special events that featured collaborations with brands such as Pokemon, TMNT, and Hello Kitty. It's definitely lovely to see all of this fun 'n' funny artwork once again, even though I can't help but feel a pang of wistful nostalgia for my gurls P&M.

The trailer that dropped alongside the announcement at least points to this. There’s some first-person movement and talking to people, but no sign of, say, puzzles or combat. It mixes 3D environments with 2D pixel art characters, and the aesthetic is inspired by the Berlin techno scene.\nhttps://youtu.be/d0hiE-LnOD0\nTechno Banter casts you as a bouncer at a club. The gameplay focuses on deciding who to let through to enjoy the club and who to throw to the turf. Everywhere I look, Techno Banter keeps pointing out its “witty” dialogue. I’m not putting that in quotes to be disparaging. That’s actually how they describe it in the press release.\nConstantly pointing to your own humor is a bit of a red flag for me. If you’re funny, you don’t have to tell people you’re funny. I don’t tell people I’m funny, but that’s mostly because it would be flagrantly incorrect.\nThe trailer doesn’t really show off any of this dialogue or even imply that it’s going for the humorous approach. However, it does show off an excellently executed aesthetic. I guess what I’m saying is I’m curious. I may not have a very clear idea of what Techno Banter wants from me, but I'm willing to give it a look.\nTechno Banter is coming to PC and consoles sometime in 2023\nThe post Techno Banter makes you a bouncer in a weird world appeared first on Destructoid.",

We’re excited by how the game is shaping up, and it’s gotten quite big, so we want to take the time to make the game as good as we can.

Since then, it has become a bit of a running gag among the community, as a confirmed release date continues to evade the eager fans. This latest pushback will no doubt garner further sighs, but we can have faith in Team Cherry's ability to deliver the goods when the fateful day arrives.\nHollow Knight: Silksong will follow the adventure of the former antagonist-turned-friend Hornet, who finds herself a prisoner of the troubled kingdom of Pharloom.

The long-awaited sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is finally here, with reviews confirming that it was well worth the hype (you can read our full review here). The entry innovates and expands upon the formula established by Breath of the Wild in myriad ways, giving players the most open-ended Zelda game yet. \nWith the launch finally here, we sat down with series producer Eiji Aonuma and director Hidemaro Fujibayashi to talk about the daunting task of following Breath of the Wild, as well as the new game's successes and challenges.\nThere are several things in Tears of the Kingdo…",

With The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom carrying forward and expanding much of what made Breath of the Wild so special more than six years ago, I decided to scan through the entire Legend of Zelda collection of Amiibo figures across multiple days to see what each figure yields.\nIt's worth noting that these figures' rewards all come with RNG mechanics, meaning that many of the good drops will require you to scan the figures multiple days before getting the reward you're really after.

          "description": "We know Mortal Kombat 12 is apparently coming sometime this year, and Ed Boon is stoking the fires of excitement by seemingly teasing an impending announcement.\nIn a Warner Bros. Discovery earnings call in February, CEO David Zaslav told investors that Mortal Kombat 12 was planned for release this year. Initially, Boon didn’t confirm or deny the news, but today he tweeted out a short video of a clock hand dramatically ticking towards 12 that then, interestingly, skips over it to strike 1. Boon's tweet asks, “Does anyone know what time it is?”\nDoes anyone know what time it is? #MortalKombatpic.twitter.com/pXY2wlidde\nMay 10, 2023\nIt might be the 12th mainline fighting game, but the teaser could be hinting at a reboot of sorts. Regardless, it appears an announcement could be imminent, which seems especially likely following the big delay of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Summer Game Fest is less than a month away, so it wouldn’t be surprising to see the hotly anticipated sequel pop up there.\nMortal Kombat 11 was released in 2019, with its Aftermath expansion arriving the following year. Developer Netherrealm also released Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, a mobile RPG, last fall. Although Netherrealm has released an Injustice game in between Mortal Kombat releases since 2013, it appears to be bucking that trend by jumping straight to the 12th entry. \nWhat do you want to see in Mortal Kombat 12?

Her return triggers a flood of childhood memories, which players relieve in flashbacks as a child version of Mimi. Gameplay involves exploring the cottage, taking pictures, and collecting keepsakes while witnessing the bond between Mimi and her grandmother and learning how these nostalgic experiences connect to the present.

You can check it out below: \n\n\"We're thrilled to have the opportunity to create new IP that is bold and tonally different from our prior work,\" Game Freak director Kota Furushima writes in the release. \"From the beginning, Private Division was the publisher we wanted to work with on our new game.

The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it?

Harmony: The Fall of Reverie is a choice-driven adventure starring Polly, a woman who returns home to find her missing mother. It's here Polly discovers she has clairvoyant abilities connecting her to a strange dimension called Reverie. While visiting this world, Polly becomes Harmony and encounters six powerful god-like beings called Aspirations, which serve as the hearts of humanity such as Glory, Power, Chaos, Bliss, and Truth. \n\n\nPolly must restore the balance between Reverie and our world and decide which Aspiration ultimately inspires humanity by making decisions represented by a system called the Augural. This web presents a multitude of scenes players will jump between that reveal possible futures that, in turn, unlock additional story branches. Polly does this by collecting crystals given to her with each choice and character bond she makes, which are used to unlock nodes on the Augural that alter the course of the story. \nHarmony: The Fall of Reverie sports a vibrantly illustrated art direction and a soundtrack by award-winning composer Lena Raine. You can try it out early thanks to a limited-time Steam demo launching today that will be available until May 21.\nFor more on Don't Nod, check out its other new title, Banishers: Ghosts of a New Eden, which also launches later this year.",

But its failure is a disappointing situation for several reasons. Developer Arkane is one of my favorite studios, so it sucks to see it fumble the ball. My admiration for the team made me genuinely excited for Redfall, which I still think is a cool premise on paper, making it a tough pill to swallow in practice. But the most upsetting element is seeing a studio fall short after trying something new and getting criticized for even attempting it.  \nThere are many valid reasons to drive a stake through Redfall’s heart, but the most worrying sentiment I’ve seen is Arkane should have never made it and given us Dishonored 3 or Prey 2 instead.

          "description": "Billy and Jimmy Lee are making a comeback in Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons. This new co-op brawler is coming this summer and will revitalize the dormant series in a new tag-team-focused adventure.\nSet in New York City after it’s been destroyed by nuclear war, Billy and Jimmy must take back what remains from the violent gangs that have since taken over. They won’t be doing it alone, though. The game features 13 playable characters, including Marian, the brothers’ old love interest, who now packs a pistol to blast threats from afar, and newcomer Uncle Matin, a tank-like fighter with a riot shield. \n\n\nAccording to a press release, Double Dragon Gaiden boasts “seamless tag team abilities and a multitude of strategies for devastating combos, defensive and offensive moves.” Solo players can swap characters on the fly to switch between their individual skills, such as the offense-focused Jimmy and more defensive Billy. The game supports two-player local co-op at launch (online co-op is coming in a post-launch update). \nDouble Dragon Gaiden tasks players with toppling four gang leaders and features a unique dynamic mission select system. Missions can be tackled in any order, and this selection affects their length, difficulty, and the number of enemies that appear. Earning cash unlocks powerful special movies that instantly knock out enemies, and you can also obtain crowd control moves that can wipe out multiple foes. Other gameplay options include an adjustable difficulty, permadeath and infinite modes, and unlockable bonuses. \nDouble Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons is being developed by Secret Base and published by Modus Games. It's coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",

          "description": "Redfall is now available for players worldwide, but unfortunately, I’ve only been playing for a few days and cannot provide a full review yet.\nWriting this Redfall review-in-progress is painful because Arkane Studios is one of my favorite game developers, and its new game is largely disappointing. While the open world is beautifully sculpted with intriguing vistas, it’s weirdly empty, often implying that the harbor town’s vampire usurpers invaded during the offseason. \nAs a whole, Redfall’s gameplay is unbalanced. Several puzzling decisions, like a lack of stealth takedowns or the inability to pause the game in single-player mode, are far from what I’d expect from an Arkane game. Rampant technical issues hinder the brighter moments of the experience, including frequent server crashes, inputs failing to work, NPCs and enemies spawning duplicate versions of themselves, and one very frustrating bug which prevents me from closing the world map and main menu in cooperative play. \nOn a positive note, I like the four launch protagonists, each with unique skills you can upgrade via a straightforward-but-effective skill tree. Also, a handful of weapons are neat, like the heavy-hitting stake launcher or ultra-violet raygun that turns vampires to stone. A few locations, like a deranged scientist’s mansion, a cliffside lighthouse, and a hangar repurposed as a prison quarter, provide enough challenge to incentivize intelligent pathfinding. Unfortunately, most locations and enemy placements feel haphazardly designed – certainly a byproduct of creating two open-world maps. \nHowever, my evaluation may change in the coming days. I’ve completed roughly 50 percent of the game and its first story arc, but I’ve only played for a few days and have more content to see.\n\nWe’re reviewing Redfall on PC. Here are our computer specs: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090, AMD Ryzen 9 5950X 16-Core Processor, 64GB RAM",

          "description": "Vampire Survivors is going Hollywood thanks to the announcement of an upcoming animated TV adaptation. \nDeveloper poncle has confirmed that it's working with gaming consulting company Robot Teddy and media company Story Kitchen to bring the hit arcade bullet hell game to the small screen. Story Kitchen is helmed by names such as Dmitri Johnson (co-producer of the Sonic the Hedgehog films), John Wick creator/writer Derek Kolstad, and APA agent Mike Goldberg. There’s currently no other details about what the series will entail, such as the cast or a premiere date. \n“The most important thing in Vampire Survivors is the story, so it's a dream come true to see what started as a little indie game I made on my weekends come to life as an animated TV show! It’s also great to be partnering up with such experienced and talented people to make the show. I do wonder if they've realised that there isn't a single vampire in Vampire Survivors, though,” says Luca Galante, founder of poncle in a press release.\nIf you're tilting your head wondering how a pixelated arcade game can be translated into a show, it's worth nothing that Vampire Survivors has been brought to life in animated form before. Its two expansions – Legacy of the Moonspell and the recently launched Tides of the Foscari – both featured slick animated trailers, so those could be reference points for how this series may potentially appear. \nVampire Survivors has been on quite a roll since it launched to widespread acclaim last year, scooping up several end-of-year awards and walking away with a couple of BAFTA trophies this year, including winning Best Game.

It will also feature a new chapter called \"The Final Note\" that gives players an alternate perspective on the first game's story. Layers of Fear is being developed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. You can check out the game's performance, as well as its new mechanics and visual enhancements, in the gameplay trailer below: \n\n\nLayers of Fear will support Ray-Tracing, HDR, and 4K resolution. Plus, it uses Lumen global illumination (you might recognize the word \"Lumen\" from Epic Games' Unreal Engine showcase back in 2021), Niagara visual effects \"to create particle effects in real time\" and Action System Controls \"to improve the development process and optimization of all gameplay mechanics,\" according to a press release. \n\"Creating games with Unreal Engine 5 is a great opportunity for the whole team, as it means our game development process can skyrocket in quality,\" Anshar Studios lead programmer Tomasz Bilnicki writes in the press release. \"It has an incredible power when it comes to the implementation of dynamic lighting, shadows, and potentially beautiful worlds for players to explore. We hope that – thanks to the engine – we'll provide players with the unique, immersive, visually stunning, and atmospheric experience in graphical fidelity.\" \nLayers of Fear will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in June. \nFor more, read Game Informer's review of Layers of Fear and then check out our thoughts on its sequel in our Layers of Fear 2 review. \nAre you picking up Layers of Fear this June?

From Software announced this out of nowhere with a surprise trailer today that runs more than three minutes long.

And we can't wait to check it out in just a few months. \nThe trailer also reveals what you can expect from the game's various digital editions and the special Collector's Edition – check them both out below: \n\nArmored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon launches on August 25, 2023.
