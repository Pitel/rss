Eight years on, we're desperate to see 'Switch 2' get the same treatment.\nTo be clear, the 2017 presentation wasn't the first time we had laid eyes on the Switch — that came in the now-iconic rooftop-party trailer a few months earlier — but it was where all the information dropped. With a Treehouse steam arriving the next day and revealing the launch line-up, the console would land in stores a mere seven weeks later (which is wild, when you think about it), beginning the era of the Switch.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

We're not sure that it ever really went away, to be honest, but we've got The Rings of Power on TV (and it's actually rather good now), the War of the Rohirrim hit cinemas, a 'Hunt for Gollum' movie is planned, and, perhaps most importantly for us, more Middle Earth games are on the horizon.\nGollum launched on multiple consoles in 2023 — though the Switch version is still in limbo (something we're sure you were all devastated about) after Daedalic shut down its internal development team. But Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game — surely a shoo-in for 2025's Clunkiest Title Award — is right around the corner, bringing a slice of Hobbit life to Switch in March.

Not that anyone should need the lingering threat of getting served a McLungButter to be polite to service workers, but it seems good to have the option. Possibly spurred on by reality-challenged goblins hounding Final Fantasy 7 Remake Aerith actor Brianna White, Square Enix have shared a new policy outlining how they plan to respond to harassment from customers toward their staff and partners. It's obviously a vastly more proper and legally sound approach than the aforementioned sandwich tampering, but I support it nonetheless.\nRead more",

Finally, a game brave enough to ask: \"what if everything cool that went down in Romance Of The Three Kingdoms was thanks to you, a magical, beautiful boy that no-one's ever heard of?\".\nIt's a great premise, honestly. The slate wiped clean, what if you got to be mates with everyone from all sides in this grand ensemble tale of warring states? A battle might take eight minutes. The three consecutive bonding cutscenes before the next might take ten. Origins is just as much about fighting thousands at a time as it is about eating lunch with Zhang Fei or discussing the meaning of heroism with Zhou Yu. There's a parallel story about your character and his role in a magical order of destiny godlings I didn't find the least bit interesting, but the rest is thrilling because Romance is already thrilling. The parts that Origins bogs down with its wordier take on already wordy source material are enlivened again by anime vibrance, hijinks, and melodrama.\nRead more",

          "description": "The first time I died in Beyond Citadel, the game treated to me a close-up shot of my character's scantily clad, bisected body lying in a pool of guts and ripped underwear. It turns out you can turn off a lot of the gore and nudity. You can also swaddle yourself in some nice, sturdy, PG-13 body armor. But you're seemingly stuck with a certain base percentage of bulging, softcore gratuitousness in both the character portrait on bottom left, and in the mildly boobulent background art of the world. I'm not sure I can put up with all that, which is a shame, because Beyond Citadel is otherwise a promising, eerie FPS that mixes ideas from 90s shooters in pretty appealing ways.\n Read more",

Coming soon to press that advantage are the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D, a pair of even higher-spec processors that headlined AMD’s plethora of CES 2025 hardware announcements.\nNo pricing (or exact release date) on these yet, but they both up the core and thread counts over the 9800X3D while peaking at higher boost clock speeds. And, of course, they share the same 3D V-Cache design that makes the 9800X3D such a superlative CPU in the first place. If you don’t know what this is and how it helps game performance, imagine how much faster you could eat Wotsits if you had a massive bucket of them on your desk at all times, instead of having to get up and walk to the kitchen to grab individual packs. In this case the Wotsits are data, the bucket is 3D V-Cache, and the hastened ruination of your digestive system is games running faster.\nRead more",

Their wholly owned subsidiaries including League Of Legends developers Riot Games, Path Of Exile developers Grinding Gear Games, and UK outfit Sumo Group. They own shares in everything from Epic Games through Ubisoft to Silent Hill 2 rebooters Bloober Team. Are you a game developer? Odds are that at least one percent of your body belongs to Tencent. Maybe one of your toes.\nAnd now it turns out that Tencent are some kind of military operator, as well. Or at least, that's what the US Department of Defence would have us believe: they've just somewhat randomly added the firm to an infamous list of Chinese military companies, together with lithium-ion battery maker CATL. This potentially makes it difficult for Tencent to do business in the States, but Tencent say that it's all based on a \"misunderstanding\".\n Read more",

One was a cheesy round-up of the best manboobs in video games for Green Man Gaming's long-vanished blog. It was published sometime in 2010, and IIRC, pre-reboot Kratos came out on top. I think/hope it still exists somewhere in the apparatus of Green Man Gaming, hidden beneath the retailer's veneer of respectability like a barrel of radioactive waste. The other boob article was a piece for OXM about Ken Levine saying that he wished people would stop fixating on Elizabeth's cleavage in Bioshock Infinite - a complaint we might consider slightly hypocritical, given the character's visual design.\nNow it's time for boob article number 3: some modder has given 122 of the 150 Jokers in cardgame Balatro big chests. This extends from visibly human Jokers to Joker concepts that shouldn't, strictly speaking, have the capacity for boobage. The banana card has boobs, for example. The credit card card has boobs.

You will supposedly drive sports cars, shoot guns at people, and accrue in-game cash.

Developers NetEase had recently doled out bans of up to 100 years to players they suspected of cheating, but in their eagerness, failed to distinguish between legitimate compatibility layers – the software that non-Windows operating systems, like the Steam Deck’s SteamOS, use to run native Windows games – and actual hacks. Per IGN, NetEase have now apologised to the affected players, and lifted the bans.\n Read more",

As a concept, at least, SpaceCraft seems both flavourless and oddly inclined to overplay its own familiarity. I mean, look at that title. Consider its chilly blend of functionality and punmanship. Look at that capital \"C\", poking out of the middle like the bow on a present whose silhouette leaves nothing to the imagination. You already know broadly what this game involves, yes? Indeed, you do: it's a game about crafting spacecraft, so that you can travel to other planets and craft their resources into other, better spacecraft. This you may do eternally, for there are thousands of planets in store.\r\n \nRead more",

Since then, my experience of the character has been one long litany of Gar-memes and in particular, Gorefield memes. For those blissfully unaware, Gorefield is a version of Jim Davis’s otiose, lasagna-loving housecat who has broken his comic strip shackles and become a cosmic abomination. Gorefield's manifestations are many: centipede Gorefields, arachnid Gorefields, Gorefields that extend serpentine necks of unfleshed bone towards a cowering Jon Arbuckle, demanding to be fed in a voice that sounds nothing like Bill Murray, a voice as deep and velvety as the eternal Monday before the Big Bang.\nIn Gar-Type, a free Gorefield fangame from Youtuber and pixel artist LumpyTouch, Garfield has become a planet. The good news is that, unlike many other Gore-variants, this Gorefield is vulnerable to bullets. It falls to ace pilot Jon Starbuckle and his prototype starfighter, Gar-Type D, to save the Earth from lasagnnihilation.\n Read more",

          "description": "I'm quite proud of the delights that we packed behind each door of the Advent Calendar this year, to be honest. All my major choices are in there, plus a few more that I haven't played but I'd watched other people play, and had a swell time doing so. Still, there are always a handful that don't quite make the cut, but still deserve a heaped Christmas plateful of praise at year's end. So here's my selection box, my bonus games of the year for 2024. It's an unusually diverse triad this time.\n Read more",

I want to park my soul in the head of a scared Scotsman way out of his depth, hundreds of miles from shore. The closer I can comfortably fit in my character's shoes, the more I seem to buy into the world they inhabit. Even if that world is constantly glowing a magnificent crimson. \nRead more",

          "description": "My selection box isn't really a selection box. It's a tray of barely-nibbled leftovers, hastily lifted from my Steam backlog. One of the disadvantages of being news editor, you see, is that I have  developed a goldfish-grade attention span. In my hectic pursuit of the next scoop, or the next Elden Ring update changelog, I snatch and cast aside game demos like a pickpocket speedrunning the checkout line at Harvey Nichols. I'm dimly aware that some of these cast-aside games are Very Good. A few might even deserve to be played for longer than 30 minutes. I feel immensely guilty about that. Perhaps a little... existential, too. I have measured out my life in tutorial levels. \r\n\n\r\nSo! Rather than digging out three of the games I've actually completed this year, such as The Crush House, Death Of A Wish and Mask Quest, I'm going to gamble on recommending a few I've barely scratched, but which sure feel excellent and have attracted a positive critical consensus. If I am false in this assessment, may Horace the Endless Bear bite my head off for my impudence. Let's begin.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The only thing missing from his account of the game was the bread needed to make that rich, meaty concoction a tasty, nourishing sandwich.\nAnd by bread, I of course mean the strategic layer - the parts between the turn-based battles where you pick your next mission, improve your squads, deal with pop-up story events, appraise your standing with each NPC faction, and equip your strike cruiser with auxiliary systems. Developers Overhype have now shared a few details of how it all works. Mmmmm, such malty, yeasty strategicalness.\r\n \nRead more",

Instead, I want to talk about mini PCs – not just small-form-factor desktops, but properly tiny, box o’ chocolates-sized computers – which have, of course, been around for decades.\nRecently, however, I’ve been wondering if mini PCs are finally on the cusp of having their moment as serious games machines. Between rising desktop component prices and ever-ballooning electricity bills, it would make sense that a smaller, cheaper system would take on a new appeal, and the success of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally show that convenience still trumps out-and-out performance for a lot of PC players. There have even been hints that Valve are resurrecting their Steam Machine mini PC concept, years after a flopping first attempt. Should you be interested?\nRead more",

Its structure most resembles Songs of Conquest or Heroes of Might and/or Magic, but with little RPG emphasis or base building, and minimal tactical fighting.\nTaxonomy is arbitrary and often unimportant at the end of the day, but I am very glad to firmly rule it out of one category: It's not a bloody card game. It looks like one, sure. You do most things with cards, and characters acquire more cards over time. But even if you absolutely, utterly, and correctly loathe card-based systems, this game has none.\nRead more",

          "description": "Baví vás bastlení, fyzika, IT a nebo prostě cokoliv technického? Proseděli jste celé Vánoce v záři obrazovky počítače a nebo jste o tom alespoň snili? Chcete se pochlubit technickými vánočními dárky? Pak doražte na Virtuální Bastlírnu - online pokec (nejen) techniků a bastlířů!\r\n\r\n\r\nPokud by se konverzace zadrhla, mají organizátoři ze Strahovské Bastlírny připravena i náhradní výplňová témata. Velká studnice je to, co se dělo na hackerské konferenci CCC (Chaos Communication Conference) mezi svátky - mluvilo se tam o tom, jak se dá shodit rozvodná síť po rádiu, jak hacknout nový procesor Raspberry RP2350 a o tom jak pokračuje hackování vlaků v Polsku.\r\n\r\n\r\nI na svět hardware jsou Strahováci připraveni. Na internetu se objevil postup, jak \"snadno\" vyrábět doma plošné spoje s pomocí výkonného vláknového laseru. Také se v diskuzi našel skvělý spis o tom, jak poznat falešné teploměry DS18B20 a co to vlastně znamená.\r\n\r\n\r\nA nebojte, i na bizár může dojít. Věděli jste, že největší sériově vyráběná CRT televize váží přibližně 200 kilogramů a na světě se už ví jenom o jedné existující? A že Windows interně zkoušejí konvertovat znaky z UTF-16 do ASCII podle jejich grafické podobnosti, což vede k velkému množství elegantních exploitů?\r\n\r\n\r\nPříští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v úterý 14. ledna od 20:00 (pozor, změna) minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

          "description": "Dreaming Isles is a game that doesn't like to hold your hand. Instead, for better or for worse, this swashbuckling life simulator expects you to figure out how to interact with almost every in-game system through trial and error. This includes the all-important art of crafting.\n\n\nTo become the farmer everyone who lives on the Dreaming Isles needs you to be, you'll have to build the best tools for the job. Here's how to craft things in Dreaming Isles.\n\n\nHow to unlock the crafting table in Dreaming Isles\n\n\nImage via Destructoid\n\n\nBefore you'll be able to build anything in Dreaming Isles, you'll need to unlock the farmhouse. We've already got a guide on how to do that, so check it out if you're having trouble. Once inside, head up to the big wooden bench on the wall next to the bedroom. This is the crafting table.\n\n\nYou won't be able to craft much with the materials you collected on the island, so you'll want to head down the stairs in the top-right corner of your house. This will take you to an underground tunnel where you'll encounter Elise. After you've talked with her, open the chest to the right and nab yourself a sword and a pickaxe. Use the pickaxe to mine some iron and the sword to take out a few bats and collect their fangs or hides.\n\n\nOnce you've got these, head back to your house and head to the crafting table. Click on it to open the crafting menu. Dreaming Isles' crafting system is easy to understand; just hover over the tool or weapon you want to build and click its icon. The game even tells you how many of each item you can craft based on how many materials you have.\n\n\nOnce you've got the basics of crafting down, the world of Dreaming Isles becomes your oyster. You can't build much at first, but every item you craft will help you get more valuable materials you can use to make better tools and build your farm into an agricultural goldmine.\n\nThe post How to craft in Dreaming Isles appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "I hope you aren’t afraid of heights, because The Wandering Band’s skybound city-builder, Airborne Empire launched into Early Access today. It’s now available on Steam.\n\n\nAirborne Empire is the sequel to the well-received 2020 city-builder, Airborne Kingdom. It continues the concept of building flying (Airborne, if you will) civilizations. Having never played the original, it’s hard for me to tell you exactly what’s different, but I can tell you that this one has you constructing the ultimate flying fortress. You travel the world, helping people and fending off sky pirates, while developing technologies that will help your sky neighborhood soar.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Early Access blurb, “When we launch into Early Access, the most important features of the game will already be there: building, researching, balance, lift, movement, dialogue, and more.” However, it gets very honest directly after that, saying, “The launch version has an enjoyable gameplay loop, but is still a bit bare-bones, lacking content and polish.” I personally appreciate the up-front warning. \n\n\nFurthermore, the Early Access run is planned for one year, during which time they “plan to add new building types, new biomes, new events/missions and expand the background story of the game.” Listen, the most important thing I can think of here: “Weather system.” I know that sounds like sarcasm, but I honestly love a good weather system in games.\n\n\nAirborne Empire is now available in Early Access on PC via Steam.\n\nThe post Airborne Empire takes flight into Early Access appeared first on Destructoid.",

Naturally, it will require a bit of searching on your part to come across them. However, these chests can be immensely valuable, and they can earn you some interesting rewards.\n\n\nLet's find out how you can find all the Sunken Treasure chests in Fisch.\n\n\nHow to find Sunken Treasure chests in Fisch\n\n\nSunken Treasure chests can spawn on any of the named islands currently available in the game. Hence, finding one can be confusing, but there are some ways you can make the task easier. Firstly, there will be a server-wide notification that will state the name of the island where a Sunken Treasure chest has spawned. You can also find this out by simply asking someone in the global chat.\n\n\nOnce you know the name of the island, just spawn your ship from the closest Shipwright NPC available. Once you travel to the island, don't get off your boat/ship. Instead, travel the surrounding waters and keep your eyes out on the water. The chests will be floating in the ocean waters, where you'll be able to open them and obtain all the contents.\n\n\n\n\nAll Fisch Sunken Treasure chest rewards\n\n\nEvery Sunken Treasure chest will always contain credits, which are immensely useful. It can also include any of the following items inside it as well:\n\n\n\ntitle\n\n\ndifferent types of baits\n\n\ndifferent types of totems\n\n\nAuric Rod (very low odds, but it can be found)\n\n\nFree Boat (extremely low odds, but it can be found)\n\n\n\nAll things considered, Sunken Treasure chests are highly beneficial, and you should always keep your eyes out for them. Finding them can be a bit tricky in Fisch, but the rewards are well worth your time and efforts. If you want to bypass luck and add a new rod and boat, make sure to complete the Dr. Glimmerfin quest as well.\n\nThe post All Sunken Treasure Locations in Fisch appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you've been enjoying the Meteors update in Dig It, the Lunar New Year event will be the perfect content to grind for.\n\n\nThe update, which went live during the weekend, is all about the brand-new island, which is now available inside the game. It also marks the introduction of Magnets, which will be immensely important if you're trying to find high-rated loot. Let's take a look at how to complete this event and what type of rewards you can get.\n\n\nHow to reach the New Year Island in Dig It\n\n\nThe Lunar New Year Island can be found quite easily close to the Mole Island. You can reach it from Noobville, which is the starter island. Almost the entire island is diggable, making it useful for gaining valuable treasures.\n\n\nYou can find 24 new items on the island. Three of those items are Legendary, while two are Mythical. To improve your odds, you can use Magnets in your setup. The New Year Event has also introduced Legendary and Mythical Magnets. In case you couldn't make it out from their names, these Magnets will ensure that you only end up with an item of the same rarity.\n\n\nThe Lunar New Year Island is available in Dig It till January 31, 2025, as it's an event-exclusive location.\n\n\n\n\nAll Lunar New Year Gifts in Dig It\n\n\nThe Lunar New Year introduces three unique gifts as part of the celebrations. Like the 24 new treasures, these three items are also hidden in the terrain. To get them, you'll have to dig them up. However, the three items have different dates when it comes to when you can open them.\n\n\n\nGift of Abundance: January 13, 2025\n\n\nGift of Fortune: January 15, 2025\n\n\nGift of Dragons: January 18, 2025\n\n\n\nThere's a bit of a pay-to-win element about these gifts since you can also just buy them straight from the in-game store.\n\nThe post Dig It Lunar New Year Event guide appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Ho, ho, ho, Santa is in town. And he’s brought a gift with him. Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.

Ale je to výrazně snesitelnější než \"Oni a Silvio\", především proto, že hlavní hrdinka to celé nějakým smysluplným způsobem spojuje. (Ilča 60 %)",

          "description": "Následuje neupravovaný text zajímavého prohlášení, které vydal můj oblíbenec Varhan Orchestrovič Bauer k nové verzi slovenské hymny:\n\n\nS úctou a upřímnou pokorou jsem přistoupil k aranžmá národní slovenské hymny \"Nad Tatrou sa blýská\" již v roce 2016. Hudebně vychází z původní lidové písně a již dávno zažité sestupné basové linky původně inspirované čardášem. V monumentální instrumentaci zaznívá důstojné a bohaté \"hradní\" Maestoso s výraznou smyčcovou figurací a dramatické Presto s vypjatým protihlasem tak kontrastně jako dunajské nížiny a Vysoké Tatry.
