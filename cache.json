It's a genre that's ripe for the picking, absolutely stuffed full of crackers to be revisited but, for every delightful return to the likes of Samurai Shodown 2, Guilty Gear, or Street Fighter, you're gonna end up with something that has no real reason to be revived at all. Something like SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos.\nA product of what's known as SNK's 'dark period', what you've got here is an arcade game that looks the part, sounds the part, and has a roster that should be kicking ass and taking all the names. However, as nicely as it's presented — and a quick glance at these screenshots still makes us want to go on a retro-fighter bender — it's just...not very good, and it never was.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

While the prequel trilogy was setting its sights on Anakin Skywalker's epic arc from good to evil (or from 'Yippee’-ing child actor to underappreciated grown-up actor, depending on your point of view), LucasArts turned to the video game scene to provide some 'wider reading' for those who wanted to know their Midi-chlorians from Mandalorians.\nOne such release in this era of new characters and lore was Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, a 2002 (2003 in Europe) GameCube and PlayStation 2 action-adventure that put you in the Beskar boots of badass bounty hunter Jango Fett — before his all-too-brief head-to-head (or, head-to-no-head) with Mace Windu in Attack of the Clones. It's generally remembered for its clunky controls and unfairly difficult combat encounters, but it was a fun romp around the galaxy that provided some much-needed, non-canon backstory for the short-lived bounty hunter.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

We had Another Code: Recollection, Mario vs. Donkey Kong, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Luigi's Mansion 2 HD already banked and that was before Donkey Kong Country Returns HD (releasing in 2025) was added to the pile. Sure, new titles like Echoes of Wisdom and Mario & Luigi: Brothership left things looking a little brighter, but, like it or not, as the Switch keeps chugging through its eighth year, Nintendo is clearly relying on the old faithful to tide us over until new hardware.\nIt's no surprise, of course. Game development is no walk in the park, and despite the Switch's undoubtedly impressive library, there are still a handful of classics that are yet to make the jump to the hybrid console *cough Wind Waker cough*. It's the way that most Nintendo consoles go in their senior years, but these late-life lineups have historically been counterbalanced by a 'Nintendo Selects' range, a chance for owners to catch up on some of the console's bestsellers at a reduced price.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

From the premise alone, you can already tell the game is quirky, cute, and heartwarming; you're playing as a deceased cat (called Pluto) who is sentenced to being the afterworld's janitor. But after befriending some ghosts, Pluto discovers that there may be a treasure hidden in the afterlife that will allow him to speak with the living.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

He wants to do this using cards. There are 47 of them - a forest of silhouettes, laid across the blood-stained table between you. Every turn, you flip a tree card to reveal a flame. When the flames spread to a player’s Tower card, it’s game over.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Overwatch 2 director Aaron Keller has posted a lengthy blog on Steam about the transition from 6v6 player matches in the first Overwatch to 5v5 in the poorly received free-to-play sequel. It's a juicy read for armchair designers and lapsed Overwatchers like myself, packing in analysis of class roles and the shift from the free choice of heroes to single hero picks and enforced team compositions.\nIn broad strokes, Keller summarises how the Overwatch experience has drifted away from \"player freedom and creativity in order to create a more balanced, consistent and competitive experience for players\". It's possible, however, that Overwatch 2 will swing back in the other direction, as Blizzard are now \"exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results\", with a view to restoring some of the joyful chaos that saw entire teams of Reinhardts charging the objective in formation.\n Read more",

Aside from a few costumes and NG+, it's basically the original package you know and - if you’re one of the fifteen people that bought the original - love.\nRead more",

Also, everyone is just so gosh darn likeable, with their foppish hats plopped atop stretched bodies, and dialogue that remains resolute, chirpy, and eager, even when you’re click-marching these poor folk straight to their deaths.\nStill, none of this will stop me will sacrificing every last man, woman, and child of these beleaguered warriors if it means preserving a single one of my immaculately crafted staircases.\nRead more",

I’ve spent a non-zero amount of time this week compiling a wishlist for potential Stardew Valley-likes that also let me keep pets. I wasn’t sure what I wanted to play, but I knew I was burnt out on both stabbing and shooting, and wanted something light and colourful with a solid loop that I could veg out (pun intended) with at the end of the day. I even went to so far as to create a chap named Karrot King in Stardew before quitting in disgust because I couldn’t easily access carrot seeds.\nI cannot in good conscious claim that I manifested such a videogame - that was the work of Skyreach Studio. However, this is the internet, so I will both take credit for it and offer you an exclusive discount on my course. While I’m waiting for your membership fee to arrive, I’ll be playing Critter Crops. It’s a witchy farming sim in which you grow odd pets and cast spells from flesh-bound grimoires. One of the verbs it offers on its Steam page is 'noodle'.

Rather, imagine that the row or column Jemma is on becomes a travelator, and you control the direction and speed of it.

Beware slight spoilers for Alan Wake 2 in the passages ahead.\n\r\nDeep in the Dark Place of Alan Wake 2 there is a forest that is not a forest - a zig-zag tunnel adorned with murals of a grisly woodland scene. Entering that tunnel, you find yourself sealed in at either end. But the mural suggests a way out: it changes when you turn around, following an unspoken narrative. It's a device as delicate as the graffiti elsewhere in the Dark Place is obnoxious. In hindsight, it feels like an example of \"metsänpeitto\", a concept from Finnish folklore about forests which, as writer Sinikka Annala explains, saturates the design of Alan Wake 2. It's a fascinating idea I'd love certain much larger, less intriguing video game worlds to learn from.\r\n\n \nRead more",

He shouldn't have slept with the Queen's sister, for example. He shouldn't have insisted his lover subsequently pay him for a confession to absolve herself of the guilt accrued from sleeping with him. He shouldn't have felt safe in a room next to the Queen, a woman described as \"reckless\" in her character traits, and who is perilously close to having a nervous breakdown. This, my holy friend, is how your bed chamber becomes a raging inferno. \nBy the end of my first game of Norland, the village of Nandos (you can name your own settlements) is covered in more blood than the back end of the bard's best work. In storytelling terms, it is a tragedy. In terms of fantasy management games? It is great fun. The failure cascade as waterslide. \nRead more",

          "description": "Crow Country, Conscript, and now Vultures - Scavengers Of Death. We really do seem to be living through a craze for PS1-style horror games. Vultures is different to the others, though, in that it's turn-based zombie crunching combined with roguelike scavenging to survive and get more powerful. It's arriving on Steam sometime soon and it's probably worth a looksy if you're after biohazard disposal with a tactical twist.\nRead more",

And yet, I find myself wanting to get hyper-specific when writing about the action of Corpus Edax, because it has an incredibly gratifying metal pipe sound, whether you’re stealthy wrapping it around the back of a blissfully unaware fool’s noggin, or lobbing it directly at their knee caps. In fact - although the game does have a delightful array of classic verbs, along with a few surprises - many of them are simply conducive to a stirring round of fisticuffs, to write my most British sentence of the week.\nRead more",

And what's frustrating is that I just don't get on with them, despite knowing that they can convey brilliant stories through all sorts of interesting cuts and shots and whatnot. I'm sorry to report that certain stories won't grab me if they're not ticking along at just the right pace or if they don't pull me in straight away. I'm a needy soul, someone who demands immediacy and a special emotional sauce.\nUntil Then is, without a doubt, the only visual novel-y game I've truly enjoyed. In fact, I'd say I've more than enjoyed it - I think it's superb so far. The teens that drive this story are written with an authenticity I've not encountered before, and the 3D interwoven with the 2D adds some surprising - besides the literal - depth.\nRead more",

Developer Torn Banner Studios has announced that, after three years, Chivalry 2 is finished and \"feature complete.\" But the team isn't done with the franchise, and more Chivalry is on the way.\n\n\nThe news was announced yesterday in a note by Steve Piggott, the studio president and creative director. According to Piggott, May's Regicide Update will be the last bit of new content coming to Chivalry 2. The team is pivoting to maintenance mode, but the bard has sung. \n\n\n\"With the Regicide Update we consider the game to be content and feature complete,\" Piggott writes in the Steam message.\n\n\nImage via Torn Banner Studios\n\n\nNot the end of Chivalry\n\n\nChivalry 2 launched into Early Access in June 2021. Since then, the multiplayer medieval combat game received eleven major updates. As noted by Piggott, fans enjoyed content drops that included mounted combat, new game modes, more maps, a new faction, and additional weapons to use for ye olde stabbing and beheading of foes.\n\n\nAccording to Piggott, the team is now focusing on the future. Its next game is No More Room in Hell 2, a multiplayer co-op shooter where you fight against hordes of zombies — coming this Halloween. But, as the headline spoils, that won't be all. \n\n\nNo More Room in Hell 2 | Image via Torn Banner Studios\n\n\n\"With this final content update delivered to players, we’re excited to focus our efforts and resources on compelling new multiplayer projects, both in the Chivalry universe as well as within terrifying new co-op territory,\" Piggott writes. \"We’ve been building our team in number and skillset to take on these following challenges, with a focused effort to ensure that when the next Chivalry title is released, it will utterly blow players away.\"\n\n\nChivalry 2 won't be hung out to dry. Torn Banner will still deliver fixes and patches for its game, which is scheduled to stay online for quite some time. \n\nThe post Chivalry 2 is finished, but it’s not the end for the Chivalry franchise appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "When it comes to mounts in Final Fantasy XIV, we’re all a little spoiled for choice. And yet, with every expansion, we get more and they’re always glorious. One new mount added in patch 7.05 was the Monowheel S1, and it’s probably one of my favorites yet. \n\n\nHowever, it’s not easy to get. Before you can drive around on your Monowheel S1, you’ve got one hell of a battle simply to get it to drop. Things are going to get pretty savage.\n\n\nHow to get the Monowheel S1 in Final Fantasy XIV\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe Monowheel S1 is a drop from The Arcadion: AAC Light-heavyweight M4 (Savage). This means that you’ve got a bit of work ahead of you if you want to be the proud owner of this unique mount. \n\n\nFirst, you’ll need to unlock and complete all of the normal Arcadion raids. This isn’t too much of a tall order, they’re fairly easy to complete once you’ve got the hang of the mechanics being thrown at you. \n\n\nThen, you’ll need to unlock and complete all of the savage versions of these raids. That means diving in and taking on Black Cat, Honey B. Lovely, Brute Bomber, and Wicked Thunder with no holds barred. This is no mean feat, with even some of the best raiders in FFXIV taking over 10 hours to get through the four bosses during the World First Race. \n\n\nOn the plus side, the Monowheel S1 Identification Key seems to be a guaranteed drop after you’ve taken down Wicked Thunder, so you’ll only need to complete the fight a maximum of eight times (as long as you keep a consistent party) before you get the mount. \n\n\nIs there another way to get the Monowheel S1 in Final Fantasy XIV?\n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nIn short, no. As with all raid reward mounts and minions, the Monowheel S1 Identification Key cannot be sold on the Marketboard or traded. This means that your only choice if you want it is to dive into savage raiding. \n\nThe post How to get the Monowheel S1 mount in Final Fantasy XIV (FFXIV) appeared first on Destructoid.",

To get the card, you'll need to complete all the tasks that are part of the objective set. \n\n\nEA FC 24 Kristen Hamilton FUTTIES objective\n\n\nThe Kristen Hamilton FUTTIES objective has four different tasks, and all of them have certain conditions. The tasks can be completed in any order, but some of them will end faster. \n\n\n\nLightning Speed: Score 5 goals using players with Min. 93 PAC in Squad Battles matches on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions).\n\n\nPinpoint Accuracy: Score 2 goals from Outside the Box in Squad Battles matches on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions).\n\n\nPlay 5: Play 5 matches in Squad Battles on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions).\n\n\nWin 4: Win 4 matches in Squad Battles on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions) while having Min. 3 players from the United States in your starting 11.\n\n\n\nTo complete the objective, the best option is to play Squad Battles. It's highly likely that you'll have to play some of your weaker cards to complete the tasks. In Squad Battles, you can choose the match difficulty, and play against AI. This is easier to manage than other modes like Division Rivals and Champions Finals. \n\n\nAfter completing the tasks, you'll get a 94-rated ST item which can also operate as a CF. It has four playstyles+, including Finesse Shot, Technical, and Rapid. This is a great combination to have on a center forward. The lack of 5* Weak Foot will be an issue, but this is a free card.

Some elite teams took things one step further, joining the World First Race.\n\n\nThe race was over in a remarkably short 10 hours (roughly), with the Japan based team GRIND coming out on top, defeating Wicked Thunder in M4 first. According to their FFlogs upload, the team achieved the feat in just 17 pulls of the boss. Sadly, GRIND was not streaming their efforts, so results were unclear in the moments after the first clears started to happen.\n\n\nWhile Square Enix does not officially preside over any World Race competitions, the community diligently watches and tracks Savage, Ultimate, …",

Whether you’re looking to make Star Coins or gain Energy, four or five star meals are definitely the best. One easy four star meal is Maguro Sushi. \n\n\nMaguro Sushi is a base game entree meal and, as with all four star meals, it’s made using four ingredients. Thankfully, these four ingredients are very easy to get, so let's take a look. \n\n\nHow to make Maguro Sushi in Disney Dreamlight Valley\n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nTo make Maguro Sushi, you’ll need the following ingredients:\n\n\n\nTuna\n\nCan be fished up in either the Glade of Trust or the Forgotten Lands from white or occasionally blue ripples\n\n\n\n\nSeaweed\n\nCan be fished up anywhere in Dreamlight Valley or the Wild Tangle on Eternity Isle from any water where there aren’t any ripples\n\n\n1 Red Algae can be used to craft 5 Seaweed\n\n\n\n\nRice\n\nGrown from seeds purchased for 35 Gold each from Goofy’s Stall in the Glade of Trust\n\n\nRice takes 50 minutes to grow and needs watering twice\n\n\n\n\nGinger \n\nForagable herb from the ground in The Forgotten Lands\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to use Maguro Sushi in Disney Drealight Valley\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nMaguro Sushi is moderately useful if you’re looking for an energy boost, offering 1,206 energy per serving.

          "description": "Adding a bit of showboat to a touchdown in College Football 25 might just be the flex you want to do over your opponent.\n\n\nThere is no shortage of celebrations to perform. Even landing a successful first down allows you to celebrate, but showboating is slightly different. For starters, it's performed in real-time while a play is still active, which makes it separate from any post-play celebrations. Secondly, knowing when to do it is important, to ensure you don't end up looking like a fool.\n\n\nCollege Football 25 showboat guide\n\n\nShowboating is the ultimate flex you can pull on your opponent in College Football 25. Like every good celebration, it has its time and place.\n\n\n\nOn offense, reach a position when you're approaching the end zone without the fear of being tackled. This is a crucial point to remember. If you're in close proximity to a defender, showboating shouldn't even be on your mind.\n\n\nOnce you're in the clear and about to approach the end zone, press and hold the L2, R2, and X buttons. For Xbox users, this will be LT, RT, and A buttons.\n\n\nYour ball carrier will start a series of over-the-top motions as they continue to run forward.\n\n\n\nYou'll still need to steer your player into the end zone. Then, you can celebrate once again by picking one of the available options.\n\n\nAs cool as it might feel to showboat in College Football 25, it's better to concentrate on securing a touchdown first. When playing against another human opponent, chances are that you won't get an open run to the end zone unless there's a vast difference between your skill levels. When playing against AI, the Freshman and Varsity difficulties do allow you chances to a few easy touchdowns, which are good opportunities to showboat.\n\n\nUltimately, a showboat is merely a flex - it won't help you get extra points. However, it could just be the right tool to irritate your friend before scoring a touchdown. \n\nThe post How to showboat in College Football 25 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A particular University of Alabama course this fall will feel like a \"Hide, Hideaway\" for many students as it's heavily inspired by Square Enix's Final Fantasy XVI.  The class \"Mythos to Logos: Religious Deconstruction and Reconstruction in Final Fantasy XVI\" will examine the religious deities of the game to help explain real-world concepts. \n\n\n\"Once a week, the class will engage in what I call a 'Game Lab,' where students will spend class time playing a video game under my guidance, with lectures interspersed to frame their gameplay,\" said the course's teacher ProfNoctis on X/Twitter. \n\n\nImage via Square Enix\n\n\nThe class focuses on eight aspects or attributes of deities and theologies in various religions and \"asks students to carefully examine the life-giving aspects of these representations from the harmful aspects of them.\"  \n\n\nTo help students understand these real-world religions, which ProfNoctis claims \"can prove difficult for students,\" the class will be using Final Fantasy XVI to help with the education process. Students will be able to enroll for ProfNoctis' class at the University of Alabama for this fall. The lab will include PS5s for students to use, thanks to a grant. \n\n\n\n\nVideo games as an educational tool\n\n\nVideo games have been a great teaching tool for many. Minecraft, for instance, has an Education Edition to help kids learn math, coding, and computer science. \n\n\nAdditionally, Dance Dance Revolution has been used in schools for physical education. The Assassin's Creed games also have the Discovery Tour, which helps players learn history without the violence.

If you’ve been waiting for the next installment, you can now get a hands on experience by downloading and playing the demo. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe demo takes place part way through Chapter 1, and players have the change to explore Rime Falls, Fallow Steppe and Rhata Harbor. In the latter, you have a chance to purchase new gear and weapons, which is good, because the demo culminates in a challenging battle with the first Chapter's boss, the Kraken.\n\n\nWithin the demo, you play as Val alongside three party members (Careena, Hinna, and Morley), and experience a range of classes including Wind and Moon. You'll also encounter many field enemies, and even this little cutie, who goes largely unexplained.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nSadly, any save data from the demo will not be passed on to the full release, although there’s an incentive to play and save your progress. If you do, you’ll be rewarded with three weapons for Val once you purchase the full game and progress as far as Chapter 1 - Gladius, Lux, and Horn Lance. \n\n\nYou’ll be able to equip Gladius as soon as Val becomes playable in Chapter 1, while Falx and Horn Lance will become usable once it’s possible to change to the Wind or Moon classes respectively.\n\n\nThe Visions of Mana demo is available on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC now. If you're playing on PC, I strongly recommend using a controller.\n\nThe post Visions of Mana has a demo out for Playstation, Xbox, and PC appeared first on Destructoid.",

Parsons states that departing employees will receive a “generous” exit package that includes severance, bonus, and health coverage. Bungie also plans to hold employee town halls, along with team and private individual meetings over the coming weeks, to help sort out the next steps. 850 employees remain following the layoffs. \n“I realize all of this is h…",

Developer Squid Shock Studios revealed that last week's sudden closure of publisher Humble Games has adversely affected its ability to provide timely support to those versions of the game. \n\n\nIn a statement posted to Twitter, Squid Shock Studios states that Humble Games' apparent closure last week, which saw its entire 36-person staff laid off by owner Ziff Davis in what it calls a “restructuring,” has adversely affected its ability to provide post-launch support for the console versions of Bō. The studio states that this is due to the game’s porting and QA support being tied to its deal with Humble. The PC version doesn't appear to be affected, with the studio currently working on updates for that version. Here’s Squid Shock Studios’ full statement:\nA statement on console ports and future updates. pic.twitter.com/PjElxfnYwP\nJuly 29, 2024\nGiven the number of games Humble published, both released and upcoming, this likely isn’t the only game or studio to have this kind of wrench thrown into the works due to the sudden layoffs. If you're planning on picking up Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus, PC seems like the best way to go for the foreseeable future. \nBō: Path of the Teal Lotus is inspired by Japanese folklore, with players controlling a warrior named Bō who descends from Heaven to fulfill an ancient prophecy. Armed with his shapeshifting Bō staff, players traverse a dreamlike, Metroidvania-inspired world battling monsters. Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus is available now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.",

The chapter’s final boss, the Kraken, awaits the playable party of Val, Careena, and Morley. \n\n\nUnfortunately, save data will not transfer from the demo to the full game. Square Enix states this is because the final version of this section has been altered “for a more satisfying experience.” Instead, those with save data from the demo who purchase the full game will receive three weapons for Val upon reaching Chapter 1: Gladius, Falx, and Horn Lance. \nFirst revealed at The Game Awards 2023, Visions of Mana marks the first original Mana entry in 15 years.

These three fighters make up half of Kombat Pack 2 and will be available when the DLC launches on September 24. \nIn keeping with the tradition of prior games, the second half of Kombat Pack 2 features guest fighters from various films.

First introduced in Mortal Kombat 3, these beastial finishing moves see fighters morph into animals to eviscerate opponents.

          "description": "Netflix’s upcoming film adaptation of Bioshock is still happening, but it won’t be as grand as originally planned. During a panel at the San Diego Comic-Con yesterday, the film’s director and producer revealed the movie now has a reduced scope due to budget cuts.\nAs reported by Variety, producer Roy Lee (Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, The Lego Movie) revealed during Collider’s Producers on Producers panel that since the film’s announcement in February 2022, a regime change at Netflix has affected the project. Netflix’s film chief at that time, Scott Stuber, has since been replaced by Dan Lin. While Stuber emphasized large spending for an expansive film slate, Lin has scaled back to a more modest strategy. This means the Bioshock film’s budget has been reduced, with director Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire) stating its been reworked as a “more personal film”. \n“The new regime has lowered the budgets,” Roy Lee said. “So we’re doing a much smaller version. … It’s going to be a more personal point of view, as opposed to a grander, big project.”\nA partnership between Netflix, Bioshock publisher Take-Two Interactive, and Vertigo Entertainment is bringing the Bioshock film to life. In addition to Lawrence and Lee serving as director and producer, respectively, Michael Green (Loga, Blade Runner 2049, American Gods) was announced as its writer in August 2022.\n[Source: Variety]",

That’s because this wacky sandbox dating sim by developer Sassy Chap is all about forming relationships with everyday household objects that, it turns out, are actually pretty hot.\nThe game bestows players with special “Dateviator” glasses that allow them to speak with objects and see them in their true, absurdly attractive forms. Dozens of objects await your affection – even elements like air and water can be courted – and branching dialogue can lead to three relationship resolutions for each character (Love, Friend, Hate). Whatever you decide will be reflected in the ever-changing 3D overworld that is your house. \n\n\nDate Everything boasts over 100 voiced characters played by performers that include Felicia Day (Critical Role, Supernatural), Johnny Yong Bosch (Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, Bleach), and Grey DeLisle (Scooby-Doo, Avatar: The Last Airbender). Given the huge amount of speaking roles, Date Everything boasts 1.2 million words and 70,000 voiced lines. \nDate Everything looks delightfully silly, but it unfortunately doesn’t have a release window. It will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.",

The long-awaited post-apocalyptic shooter was slated to arrive on September 5 but will now launch on November 20 to give developer GSC Game World more time to address technical issues.\nAdditionally, the studio announced it will release its first-ever Developer Deep Dive video to give a comprehensive behind-the-scenes look at the game. The video will feature new gameplay footage, overviews of its world and locations, a full walkthrough of a story quest, and developer interviews. It is being made in collaboration with Xbox and will premiere on August 12. \n\n\nThe delay marks another bump in the road for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl. It was formally unveiled in 2020 after years of teases at the Xbox Games Showcase but has hit snags along the way, including garnering backlash for now-canceled plans for NFT implementation. The biggest disruption was Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, where GSC Game World is based, which upended development and forced the staff to relocate to Prague, Czech Republic (though some team members actively fought and sadly perished in the war). Despite all of this, the game has managed to come together, and we even played it during Summer Game Fest this year.\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl launches on November 20 for Xbox Series X/S and PC. It will launch day one on Xbox Game Pass. If nothing else, this delay gives players more time to catch up with the Xbox re-release of the original games that arrived earlier this year.",

The price of the sale was not disclosed, but according to a press release, Player First Games will continue to operate under its current leadership of co-founders Tony Huynh and Chris White. \nThe announcement comes only a couple of months after MultiVersus' relaunch on May 28. Player First Games served as a work-for-hire studio on the game, and Warner Bros. is apparently pleased enough with its performance to formally bring the studio in-house. The move comes only a few days after Warner Bros. shuttered the entire mobile division of Mortal Kombat developer Netherrealm Studios. \n“We have worked with Player First Games over several years to create and launch MultiVersus, and we are very pleased to welcome this talented team to Warner Bros. Games,” said David Haddad, president of Warner Bros. Games. “The bright and creative team at Player First Games adds to our extensive development capabilities.”\n“Our team is excited to join the Warner Bros. Games family, and we feel that this will be great for MultiVersus overall,” Huynh said. “We are working to make the MultiVersus game experience the best it can be and having our development team integrated with the publisher is optimum for the players.”\nMultiVersus is a 2v2 spin on the Super Smash Bros. blueprint that pits a variety of characters from different Warner Bros. properties against each other. It was first launched in open beta in 2022 (read our review of that version here), then taken down months later to be rebuilt and expanded before returning this year. MultiVersus recently kicked off its second content season, and it has received new fighters such as The Joker, Agent Smith, Jason Voorhees, and the recently announced Samurai Jack and Beetlejuice.",

          "description": "Helldivers 2 has been one of 2024’s biggest successes, and developer Arrow Head Games is prepping to launch its most substantial update yet. Escalation of Freedom is an upcoming update that adds new missions, new hazards, and, of course, new bugs.\nArriving on August 6, Escalation of Freedom challenges players with a new level 10 difficulty and introduces new mission objectives, such as locating and extracting a crying larva that attracts Terminids. The game also receives new, larger fortress-like outposts for players to capture. The swamp biome gets a spookier facelift, and acid storms can now reduce the armor for players and enemies so both sides take greater damage. New Terminids and Automatons will clash with players, and Arrow Head Games teases that Escalation of Freedom features more surprises players will have to discover on their own. Check out the trailer for a look at what's to come. \n\n\nEscalation of Freedom also brings quality-of-life improvements including an update to address grief kicking. Per the PlayStation Blog, the game is getting \"a system where if a player is kicked, they will spawn into a new session as the host with all of the team’s loot from their previous session. All items can now be picked up by the player before extraction. The squad doing the kicking will see a message in the chat widget that a player has been kicked, yet their loot remains unchanged.\"\nFor more on Helldivers 2, check out our review.",

Developer Behaviour Interactive agreed and enlisted the cinematic storytelling expertise of Supermassive Games (Until Dawn, The Dark Pictures Anthology, The Quarry) to create an original story in the DBD universe. That game became The Casting of Frank Stone, and it terrorizes Game Informer’s cover this month.\n\n\nWe traveled to Behaviour’s studio in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to play an early slice of the game and speak to lead developers from both studios to learn how the collaboration came to be.

Whether it's a fictional character like Jack Sparrow or a real person like Ariana Grande, it's hard to find a corner of pop culture the game hasn't touched. These crossovers, however, are almost always exclusive to characters, but Fortnite players don't always have to traverse the Battle Royale map on foot – there are vehicles as well. Today's crossover comes in the form of a particularly polygonal vehicle: Tesla's Cybertruck.\nPulls ♾️\n@tesla Cybertruck in Fortnite tomorrow! pic.twitter.com/CA8xuYQreS\nJuly 22, 2024\nFor the unfamiliar, the Cybertruck is one of Tesla's latest electric vehicles, a futuristic-looking pickup truck with a distinct shape and stainless steel exterior. It's a vehicle that, quite frankly, always looked like it belonged in a video game, both because of its angular aesthetic and the word \"cyber\" in its name.\nIt's unclear exactly how the truck will be present in Fortnite, as the trailer doesn't include any actual gameplay, but it's likely a vehicle skin that can be purchased from the in-game store. With car skins attached, whenever a player enters a vehicle, it will morph into the selected skin of their choice, and it's available in Battle Royale and Rocket Racing alike. This is purely speculation, however – it's equally possible the vehicle is introduced in some other limited-time event.\nThe Cybertruck will be added to Fortnite tomorrow. If you drive one, just pray your opposing players aren't wielding a steel ball.\nhow do you feel about the Cybertruck being added to Fortnite? what other vehicles would you like to see in the game?

The mainstay villain has apparently survived his presumed death (again) and is ready to reclaim his throne. \nA cinematic trailer rolls out the red carpet for Heihachi, setting up his return after he was seemingly killed (i.e., tossed into a volcanic lava river) in Tekken 7. The video doesn’t explain how Heihachi managed not to melt into goop, but he does sport a Kazuya-esque scar on his chest now, so he didn’t walk away completely unscathed. \n\n\nHeihachi becomes available sometime this fall. He follows Eddy Gordo and Lidia Sobieska, who joined Tekken 8 in the spring (i.e., July 25) and summer, respectively, leaving one fighter left for the winter season.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) took issue with these changes in a filing yesterday to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\nIn case you missed it, Microsoft revealed a new tier called Xbox Game Pass Standard, a $15 monthly subscription for new members that excludes day-one releases, EA Play, PC Game Pass, and cloud gaming. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which includes those perks, will have its monthly price raised from $17 to $20. Xbox Game Pass Core, which only offers online play and a smaller library, is raising its yearly sub from $60 to $75 (the $10 monthly fee remains unchanged). PC Game Pass is increasing from $10 per month to $12. \nAdditi…",

          "description": "Paramount has canceled Halo, the live-action TV adaptation of Xbox’s flagship franchise, after two seasons. The show’s second season premiered on Paramount+ earlier this year. \nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter’s sources, Halo showrunners Amblin, Xbox, and 343 Industries are seeking a new outlet for a potential third season, with Paramount reportedly supporting the move. \n“Paramount+ can confirm that ‘Halo’ will not move forward with a third season on the service,” Paramount said in a statement. “We are extremely proud of this ambitious series and would like to thank our partners at Xbox, 343 Industries and Amblin Television, along with showrunner and executive producer David Wiener, his fellow executive producers, the entire cast led by Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief and the amazing crew for all their outstanding work. We wish everyone the best going forward.”\nAfter years of development, Halo premiered on Paramount+ on March 24, 2022, and stars Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief. Season 1 received a mixed reception from critics and fans, with many lambasting it for deviating from the games’ established lore and characterizations. Season 2, which premiered earlier this year on February 8 and concluded on March 21, was received more positively, with several critics and viewers hailing it as a dramatic improvement. Season 1 currently sits at 70% on Rotten Tomatoes/61 on Metacritic. Season 2 garnered a 90% on Rotten Tomatoes/64 on Metacritic. \nFor our thoughts on Halo Season 1, check out our video reviews of each episode. You can also read our February interview with the showrunners about how they planned to make Season 2 feel more faithful to the games.",

          "description": "Skeleton Crew, the team behind the 2021 side-scrolling action game Olija, and Devolver Digital have revealed an intriguing new project: Forestrike. The game sports a unique premise: as a martial artist, you can foresee and simulate future combat encounters, allowing you to perfect your execution before laying a finger on anyone. \nThe fighter battles to free a captive Emperor from an evil Admiral, and doing so involves mastering Foresight, a meditative technique to mentally predict and play out battles before they unfold (for Dragon Ball fans, think of image training). Gameplay-wise, players are pitted against different combinations of enemy types. They use Foresight to play the battle in advance to find the optimal approach to defeating them while taking little to no damage.\nFor example, using Foresight may help you learn to dodge a charging enemy so they trample an ally, then finish him off by lobbing a nearby weapon. Determining the best approach may take several Foresight attempts, but once you have your strategy down, you then execute the battle in real-time. After winning a fight, a replay feature allows you to rewatch it using slow-motion and other editing tools to study your strategy or generally feel cool about your performance. \n\n\nUsing the Foresight makes Forestrike's combat feel puzzle-like in its execution, and winning fights as flawlessly as possible matters. That’s because you have limited health to fight through multiple stages in a roguelike-style branching map. Along the way, you’ll earn upgrades that carry over to future runs, as well as perks called Techniques that enhance your abilities. \nForestrike is a neat spin on the action genre, and it's slated to launch sometime in 2025 for Switch and PC.",

With its servers regularly buckling under the weight of its players, the game caught lightning in a bottle but petered out when the game finally went 1.0 and simultaneously ceased receiving support in 2022. Now, developer 1047 Games is back with Splitgate 2 and aims to refine the original's winning formula. \n\n\nLike the first game, Splitgate 2 will be a free-to-play 4v4 shooter that arms players with a portal gun and more traditional firearms to battle each other in aerial, dimension-hopping combat. The sequel is being built in Unreal Engine 5 and has a new emphasis on factions. Players can suit up to compete in the Sol Splitgate League as members of one of three groups: the agile Aeros, the time-manipulating Meridian, or the trigger-happy Sabrask. According to a press release, “Factions will grant players the ability to choose and progress based on their preferred gameplay style or competitive strategies.” Splitgate 2 will feature new objective-based game modes across new arenas and upgradable weapons. \nAdditionally, a special Splitgate 2 companion app is available to download now. The app lets players explore the game’s universe through collectibles that unlock in-game rewards when Splitgate 2 launches. It also features quizzes and a new comic series called Splitgate: The Games We Play. The five-issue series will flesh out the backstory of the characters featured in the announcement trailer and additional issues will arrive monthly. \nSplitgate 2 launches in 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

It should come as no surprise, then, that the show has been nominated in numerous categories at the 2024 Emmy Awards.\nFallout was nominated in 16 categories, but two of them are particularly exciting. First, the show is one of eight nominees for Outstanding Drama Series, ranking it among other big shows of 2024, like Shōgun, which currently leads the pack with 25 nominations.

Their games are aimed at kids, their parents, and everyone in between with bright colors, wholesome storytelling, and extremely approachable game design. That said, there are exceptions to this rule, like in this creepy 15-second teaser uploaded to the company's YouTube channel last week. A man in a trench coat wearing a paper bag with a smile drawn on it stares into the camera while a distorted music box plays in the background. The only additional context we got was the hashtag #WhoIsEmio, leaving fans scrambling to figure out what exactly this was hinting at.\nToday, that mystery has been cleared up. Emio, also known as \"The Smiling Man,\" is the star of a new game in the Famicom Detective Club series, which hasn't had a new entry in 35 years. The game was revealed today alongside a video featuring series producer Yoshio Sakamoto, who wrote the first two games and went on to direct titles like Super Metroid and Metroid: Zero Mission. According to him, they decided to make this new entry during their time developing the Famicom Detective Club remakes back in 2021.\n\"In Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club, a student has been found dead in a chilling fashion, his head covered with a paper bag with an eerie smiling face drawn on it,\" a press release reads. \"This unsettling visage bears a striking resemblance to a recurring clue in a string of unsolved murders from 18 years ago, as well as Emio (the Smiling Man), a killer of urban legend who is said to grant his victims 'a smile that will last forever.'\" Players will assume the role of a private investigator and set out to solve the case and stop the killer for good.\nEmio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club will be released for the Nintendo Switch next month, on August 29. Hopefully, the titular killer won't murder too many people before then.\nAre you excited to see this series revived? Let us know in the comments!",
