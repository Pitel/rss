          "description": "It's rewind time.\nIt’s been fascinating to observe the kind of variety coming out of Riot Forge, as the publisher has worked tirelessly these last couple of years to produce spin-off games based on the lore of its enormously popular League of Legends MOBA. Since the publisher’s inception, we’ve seen a rhythm game, a JRPG, and a top-down action brawler, and now it has moved into the Metroidvania space for its latest release. Convergence: A League of Legends story may not be a very innovative entry in the genre, but what it lacks in unique vision it makes up for in heart and excellent gameplay.\nConvergence is set in the steampunk city of Zaun, following the adventures of a brilliant young inventor named Ekko. Ekko is a wisecracking, scrappy teenager who used a fragment of a magical artifact to design a piece of portable technology he calls the Zero Drive, which allows him to go back in time a few seconds and alter the flow of time around him. Ekko typically spends his days hanging out with his gang and using his Z-Drive to help him keep locals safe from being harassed by local gangs, but things take an interesting turn when he’s suddenly confronted by a much older version of himself. Future Ekko tells of some dark events that came to pass in his timeline that culminated in tragedy, prompting him to try running to the past to stop the calamity before it happens. The duo thus team up to fight for a better future, while Young Ekko tries to learn what he can from his older, wiser self.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Tears of the Kingdom, by comparison, has no such barrier and if you choose not to follow the direction that the game sends you in having completed the tutorial area, then there is every chance that you might not pick up the item altogether.\nSome of us tried this for a while, ambitiously setting off into the wasteland knowing full well that we were missing out on a pretty important bit of kit. But we soon returned to where the game originally wanted us to go with our tails between our legs, realising that traversal is near-impossible when you can't fly through the skies.

Other companies like Microsoft and Ubisoft, while not technically part of Summer Game Fest, will also reveal what they've been working on in their own showcases.

          "description": "Some games adapt to VR more naturally than others. Games that take place primarily in a cockpit, like Elite Dangerous or Euro Truck Simulator 2, need relatively little adjustment to make them enjoyable in VR. They don't require the player to move around much, and their whole shtick about providing an authentic, immersive experience. \r\n\n\r\nGames that require a lot of fast movement, or require the player to keep track of a lot of different objects, are generally harder to make work through VR Goggles. Hence why Amid Evil VR caught my attention. Shooters are common VR fodder, but they're typically built as VR experiences from the ground up. Amid Evil, on the other hand, is a flatscreen retro shooter designed to be reactive, surreal, and above all, fast. It's a game where you zip around arcane dimensions like a magic missile, splattering weird little armoured guys with enchanted swords and a staff that fires planets. It's a brilliant game, one of the best old-skool shooters to emerge from the genre's revival. But on paper, it's about as VR friendly as Morpheus.\r\n\n \nRead more",

This is Diablo's permadeath mode, where one death is enough to wipe your progress. He dinged his final ding on his Barbarian in the early hours of June 5th, just five days after the game's early access launch, and he's now been officially confirmed as the first Hardcore centurion.

But it's set very thoroughly in Taiwan towards the end of World War II, and though the focus is a young girl's relationship with her family and friends, that context is critical to why I've enjoyed it so much.\nTaxonomy aside, then, the important thing is that it's enjoyable. It hasn't hit the emotional highs of the kind of interactive fiction I favour, but for a story with such heavy themes, it provides a relaxing drip feed of mystery reveals and plot thickenings in between low-pressure minigames. It's a good time, without undermining its obvious respect for the people who had to live through this.\nRead more",

He’d come to the tech expo with Condor, a studio he’d co-founded only a few months prior, to show off Justice League: Task Force. A humble fighting game in the vein of Street Fighter, it was given a small demo booth and placed next to another game that featured a cast of superheroes, a strikingly similar visual style and, much to Brevik’s surprise, the very same name.\r\n\n\r\nWithout their knowing, Condor were one of two studios hired to develop the DC Comics tie-in: their Sega Mega Drive/Genesis version set to release alongside a SNES title made by another recently formed team, Silicon & Synapse. “We'd never talked to them,” Brevik says. “We'd never interacted with them. We didn't know there was even another version, and then we show up at the booth and they're side by side, and we're like, this is really weird.” They didn't know it yet, but these Justice League sort-of clones were the first paving stones on the road to the Diablo series. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "When RPS awarded Kentucky Route Zero the title of Game Of The Year in 2013, only two episodes out of an eventual five had been released. If this sounds like a bland statement of fact, just think about it for a second. I can't recall any other time an episodic adventure game has received GOTY-level praise before it was even concluded, let alone only 40% done.\nEpisodes three through five arrived sporadically: in spring 2014, summer 2016, and — after what must have been an agonising hiatus — the start of 2020. Having bypassed this wait to play the game for the first time only recently, I feel wistfully as though I'll never share quite the same fond feelings for it as contemporary fans (like our own reviews ranger Rachel, who recently named KRZ one of her all-time favourite indie games). But I'm also quite relieved that I didn't have to exercise that kind of patience. I mean, I'm very good at neglecting to carry on with games for years at a time despite thoroughly enjoying what I've played so far. But I like doing it on my terms, you know?\nI initially attempted to do something a bit clever with this retrospective. I wanted to play the first two episodes that earned KRZ our GOTY nod in 2013, and write up on them as a discrete entity as far as possible. Only then did I plan to carry on the game and add some follow-up impressions, perhaps assessing whether I thought RPS would still award the big chocolate medal to the full game as it finally came to be in 2020. But, after sitting with my feelings about Episodes 1-2 for a couple of weeks, any intelligent observations I might have made were drowned out by an increasingly loud, insistent voice in the back of my head howling: \"I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS.\" Actually, that might be a good impression to just let stand on its own merits.\n Read more",

My bolognese is about as authentically Italian as Super Mario, but it doesn’t matter. I’m not trying to make Massimo Bottura cry by reminding him of his nonna’s cooking. It’s a dreary Tuesday night and I’m craving my olive-laden concoction. I’m making this bolognese just for me.\r\n\n\nSlayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer reminded me a lot of my bolognese. It’s a game created for particular tastes, a unique proposition that sort of defies conventional thinking. A big, bold swing that -  if you have the palate for it - is absolutely brilliant.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "If you woke up in a mysterious mansion, with no memory of how you got there and only a walkie-talkie and a bunch of security cameras for company, how d'you reckon you'd handle it? Personally I know, sure as eggs is eggs, that I would absolutely go to pieces. I'm not hitting the end credits of The Tartarus Key in real life, but fortunately, it's a nails thriller puzzle game that fuses PS1-style retro graphics with Saw-esque murder traps. Plus, you know, it's only about six hours end to end, which isn't bad for a semi-magical kidnap plot.\nIn this situation I am not me, of course, but Alex Young, and Alex upon escaping a locked study (an easy warm-up puzzle involving postcards) she finds and frees Torres, an ex-cop turned private detective, who sets up a base of operations around the mysterious mansions main fireplace. From there game's rhythm is clearing the different wings of the house by completing increasingly difficult puzzle rooms, each eventually culminating in finding a new person to save from a new death trap - concocting the antidote for poison or following the instructions to get through an electrocuted floor maze.\nIt's an odd group, but if you rescue everyone you start to see the edges of a wider story. There's a nice layering of paranoia, because most of the puzzles have an element of, for want of a better word, magic to them. One of the very first sees you tasked with getting an academic out of a living flesh-blob, and failure results in it and him vanishing into nowhere. You also find an underground lab with notes on scientific experiments, and a holding cell slash testing chamber - but given that next door is a giant meat freezer sokoban, is it not the case that the lab is just another puzzle room set? The low-poly, low-draw distance style of everything really adds to this, and you keep suspecting that some new puzzle or trap or maybe a weird murderer is going to suddenly loom out of the darkness in front of you. It's the kind of head melting I haven't had since playing Old Gods Rising.\n Read more",

          "description": "I feel like claymation has always been a bit creepy, you know? Yeah, sure the Aardman films are whimsical and fun, but have you seen those early Wallace and Gromit shorts? There’s something kind of unsettling about the odd shape of Wallace’s uneven head and I've always deeply hated that you can sometimes see the subtle lines of a thumb imprint on parts of his face, like he’s been smothered inbetween the pads of two giant fingers. It’s so uncomfortable - and don’t even get me started on that monster Morph.\nEver since I first spotted the creepy Twitter gifs of claymation game Elation For The Wonder Box 6000, I’ve felt that same discomfort in the pit of my stomach. It’s not out yet, or even has a confirmed release date, but I just need people to witness this game. Like, just clicking through the screenshots make the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. It’s awful, and wonderful. You can watch the trailer below. The bit where the lumps of clay wriggle inside the gun's bullet chambers goes through me.\nRead more",

          "description": "One of my absolute favourite elements of Citizen Sleeper is how you essentially play as a nobody. When we first meet the Sleeper they've had their memories completely erased; the last thing they remember is stuffing themselves into a cargo container and shooting off into the depths of space - a last resort in wanting to escape the clutches of a scary corporation. They now find themselves on a dishevelled space station called Erlin's Eye, desperate and alone. They're essentially an empty shell, and one which you can etch your own story onto.\nBut it’s not their lack of personal identity that makes the Sleeper a nobody (after all, you essentially forge an identity for them as you make decisions throughout the game). It’s the realisation that, in this vast universe that developer Gareth Damian Martin has written, you’re no one. A single grain of sand in a vast desert. No one knows who you are, no one cares about you, and you’re stuck on a lawless space station, helpless, scared, and dying.\nRead more",

Instead, it was asked of Stephen Kick - at the time, a recently unemployed videogame artist holidaying in a Guatemalan hostel. Up until that point, Kick had dedicated his life to creative pursuits. He had no business background, and none of the acumen required to understand contracts or negotiate licensing fees. More to the point, he had no more than $5,000 to his name.

          "description": "Playing Diablo 4 gave me a real case of the \"Have I changed, or have the games changed?\", and I think the answer is \"yes\". For the uninitiated, Diablo forms one of the jewels in Blizzard's crown (maybe a smaller one, just offset to the Warcraft centre stone), an action-RPG series that's like if the kind of 90s metal album cover that has a skeleton on it asked to be turned into a game where you explode many hundreds of near-identical monsters to get incrementally better loot. This is a spoiler-free review of the latest greatest addition, following 2012's Diablo 3, but a Diablo game's story is sort of unspoilable, both because a) paying attention to it is of passing importance to playing, and b) the plot of them is always basically the same anyway.\nTo wit: Sanctuary, a high-fantasy world with a low-fantasy vibe, where so much as going to the next town over will be a brush with some horrible little goblin rat called a Flesh Thresher, was created as a respite from the eternal battle between heaven and hell. After X number of years of relative peace, one (or many) of the Lords Of Hell is doin' some bad stuff. Usually Diablo, I'll grant you. In this case it's Lilith, a kind of Dante's Lady Dimetrescu, who's making people horny for being stepped on power. Diablo games have always had a Grand Canyon sized gulf between the cinematics (epic; luscious; brutal) and the game in practise (clicking). IV is no different. And you know. It's fine.\nRead more",

          "description": "For a certain sort of PC gaming fan, System Shock is where it all began. 30 years of immersive sim development started here, as Looking Glass escaped the restraints of the RPG genre and embraced thoughtful first-person action. SHODAN broke free, and the world was never the same. Without System Shock, there would be no Thief or Gloomwood, no Prey or Dead Space. Bioshock was conceived as its sequel. The creative figureheads behind Deus Ex and Dishonored were wrapped up in its creation, and forever changed by contact with Looking Glass and its unique philosophy.\nCountless studios have used Citadel Station as a star to steer by, measuring their own work against System Shock’s commitment to simulation, dense atmosphere, and method-ish refusal to break character. This was not so much a game as an alternate reality. As one of our interviewees tells us: “We were trying to build the holodeck.”\nHere’s the story of how it was made, as told by the people who made it.\nRead more",

          "description": "Back in February 1991, Capcom released Street Fighter 2 to arcades. Unbeknownst to Capcom at the time, Street Fighter 2’s massive success would cause it to become the blueprint for fighting games - a genre the game effectively created upon its release. This blueprint proved to be so influential that even some of Street Fighter 2’s most underwhelming elements are still being parroted in fighting games today. As a result, more than 30 years later, one constant in the fighting game genre has always remained true: the story mode is gonna suck.\nThere have been some valiant attempts at rectifying this in the last decade, but the core issue has always remained the same; fighting games are inherently designed to be played against other people, and back-to-back fights with AI controlled characters will never be able to properly match the competition of the real thing. Yet, with Street Fighter 6, Capcom have seemingly done the impossible. Street Fighter 6 has the best story mode in any fighting game I’ve played. Admittedly a low bar, but still, Capcom could have easily half-assed the story mode, just as so many other fighting games still choose to do, and still have been widely praised based solely on the strength of its multiplayer. Instead, Capcom are offering fighting game developers a new blueprint to copy - one that prioritises teaching new players above everything else.\nRead more",

          "description": "When my Sleeper escaped their ramshackle life on the fringes of Erlin's Eye at the end of last year, they left behind a lot of unfinished business. I had to stop short my efforts to help Bliss make a go of her repair bay business, and Tala was left to finish making her brand-new distillery on her own. Yatagan agent Rabiyah probably has my name on an employment blacklist, too, after I upped sticks without telling them, and the spores of mushroom algae I'd been cultivating for Riko over in Greenway were no doubt left to rot and moulder somewhere. Instead, I jacked that all in to smuggle myself, my engineering pal Lem and his tiny daughter Mina onto a ship headed for some far-flung star out in the void. The Sidereal ship wasn't going to wait. It was now or never.\nFortunately hitting an ending in Citizen Sleeper doesn't mean the end of your save. Booting it back up again for this month's RPS Game Club, I wanted to play out a different ending to my Sleeper's story. Turning my back on Lem and Mina still brought its own kind of sadness, admittedly, but I wanted to dig into the game's trio of free DLC episodes first and foremost, as that was another thing I never got time to start last year. I've only played through the first chapter, Flux, so far, but man alive, it was not an auspicious start for the refugee flotilla ship hoping to make a new life for themselves here. In fact, I don't think it could have gone any worse, such was the monumental failure of my collective dice rolls and decision making. But despite absolutely beefing it in Flux, I also came to realise an important lesson. It's okay to fail, and that failure can often make the consequences of your actions feel all the more poignant. Sure, it might not feel nice, and yes, I wish it could have gone better. But sometimes the odds really are stacked against you, and you've just got to roll with it.\nRead more",

Most of everything is too long (songs, books, movies, everything) but it's especially felt in games, where the magical \"What's next?\" feeling of discovering a world often fades to leave the \"What task must I complete now?\" drudgery of playing a video game. So I hugely admire Cosmo D's Off-Peak series, which has built the feeling of a huge and fascinating city through only four tiny locations visited across four games with a combined playtime of under eight hours.\nRead more",

Nachystejte si ledové kávy, mojita a vodní chladiče a pojďte se se strahovskými bastlíři pobavit o technice a bastlení!\r\n\r\nPtáte se, co mají bastlíři za novinky? Například se ukázalo, že OLED s SSD1306 ve skutečnosti nejsou nutně jen černobílé. Vyšla také nová verze KiCADu včetně betaverze pluginu pro tvorbu databázových knihoven pro KiCAD v InvenTree a na internetu se objevil USB programátor/debugger ESP32 postavený na ESP32 nebo nové procesory od SiLabsu obsahující (mimo jiné) i RISC-V jádro.\r\n\r\nZ kategorie vysokofrekvenčního bastlení pak strahováci nabídnou vhled do vstupní impedance osciloskopů - jak ji změřit, proč 50 Ohm režim na osciloskopu zpravidla není zrovna 50 Ohm, jak osciloskop skutečně přizpůsobit, kde na to vzít šikovný materiál a jak jednoduše a přitom zadarmo na RF simulace. Pro majitele vektorových analyzátorů NanoVNA/LiteVNA pak ukážou dvě internetová fóra (jedno \"tajné a uzavřené\"), kde se dají sehnat aktualizace FW a podpora (jak SW, tak HW) a popíšou i postup aktualizace.\r\n\r\nAť už vás zaujalo cokoliv z nabízených témat nebo chcete ukázat nějaký svůj bastl, dorazte! Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v úterý 6. června od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

          "description": "New sequel is the fastest-selling Blizzard game ever\nWhile Diablo IV has technically only been on the market a single day, (the majority of the player base having joined Early Access last week), Activision Blizzard's latest foray into the underworld is already chewing up the nights and days of its fanbase, amassing over 10,000 years of playtime in less than a week.\nThe developer says that over 93 million hours of Diablo IV have been played across its PC and console releases in just four days — A figure that frankly makes my head spin. While Blizzard is yet to reveal specific sales figures for the dungeon crawler, it has declared the sequel its fastest-selling release ever, beating out premium titles such as Starcraft II, Overwatch, and, of course, series predecessor Diablo III.\nhttps://www…",

Some creators build up huge communities that are dedicated to watching their channel, and this can lead to a successful career. However, the Amazon-owned streaming platform has once again become the subject of online controversy. Namely, there's been a change to its ad policy, which has not proven popular.\nIn a recent post on the site, Twitch announced it would be changing the type of \"branded content\" that broadcasters would be able to have on their channel. The changes indicate that streams will no longer be allowed to insert \"burned-in\" display, video, or audio ads. This basically refers to any advertisement that is a prerecorded sponsorship. …",

According to Fergusson, the team is currently concentrating on both its seasonal output for the remainder of the year, as well as two full expansions, which one would assume are similar in scope to Diablo III's 2014 expansion, Reaper of Souls.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ6M39OmYMA\n\"As I sit here we're about to launch the main game, we're finishing up season one, we're working on season two, we're working on expansion one, we're kicking off expansion two,\" explained Fergusson. \"All that's happening right now and we haven't even launched the game yet [...] We're going to be supporting Diablo IV for years to come [with] very rich seasons, much richer than we had in Diablo III.\"\nDiablo IV launched in an Early Access capacity for Ultimate Edition owners last week, but officially hits the market today for all other players. While this new tale of demons and the people who love them has seen its fair share of launch issues, the new sequel has been positively received by many critics and fans, who have been quick to sink into Diablo's typical evening-eating action, exploring Sanctuary in pursuit of the Queen of the Succubi, Lillith.\nDiablo IV is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post Two expansion packs are currently in the works for Diablo 4 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The last resort\nNintendo has revealed that the star of Pikmin 4 will be you! Or whatever uni-browed monstrosity you can put together in the character creator.\nPrevious games in the Pikmin series have had you play as one or more pre-defined explorers. It started with Olimar, before reaching its peak with Pikmin 3’s Brittany (and some other people). However, I often say that a character creator always makes a game better. I am jazzed so hard to see one make its way into Pikmin 4.\nhttps://youtu.be/6ixnXjtQ7f8\nThe trailer Nintendo released with the announcement also shows off a bit of the story. It seems Captain Olimar has once again crashed on planet PNF-404. A rescue expedition flies off to retrieve them, and they also crash. So, they send the newest recruit to the rescue corps to rescue the rescuers, and that’s you!\nI find that hilarious because the trailer makes it appear like you don’t have much of a ship with you. It very much makes it appear that your character is the bottom of the barrel. You’re not some hotshot. You’re just the only one who hasn’t crashed (yet).\nPikmin 4 is my most anticipated game of the year, mostly because we’ve been teased about it so much. Nintendo announced the game back when the Wii U was still a thing. However, I'm excited about the direction that we've seen so far. I’m a little concerned that the dungeon caves of Pikmin 2 might return, but we’ll see. I’m as optimistic as my brain allows me.\nPikmin 4 launches on Nintendo Switch on July 21, 2023.\nThe post Pikmin 4 allows you to create your own custom explorer appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A demo is out now\nIt seems almost impossible at this stage for there to ever be a third Half-Life game. It's just been so long, and chances are that a threequel would struggle to live up to the hype. However, there are still new ways to get your Gordon Freeman kicks. For example, modder PinkyDev is working on a modification that turns Valve's iconic FPS into a roguelike shooter.\nCalled Codename: Loop, the demo for the project has just been released, so you can try it out before it releases fully. There's also a video over on ModDB that shows the Half-Life fan project in action. With a new top-down, isometric look, you once again control the mute scientist as he battles his way through invading Xen aliens. While PinkyDev says the plot is not yet written, the general story will involve G-Man confining Freeman to \"an ever-changing loop\" to test his skills.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJ8cZGctdaU\nWhen it will actually release cannot be said at this stage. Also, the reason why it doesn't have Half-Life in the title is because, as the modder says, it stops it from getting confused with other fan-made or official games on Steam. Oh, that's the other thing. This mod will be coming to Steam. According to a report from PCGamesN, Codename: Loop was given the blessing of Valve, which says a lot about the developer's dedication toward the modding community.\nWhile the first game, originally released in 1998, had a huge impact on the FPS genre, 2004's Half-Life 2 pretty much surpassed it. The sequel is easily one of the best games Valve has ever made, but that doesn't detract from the OG's influence. Loop joins the likes of the unofficial remake Black Mesa in a small yet respectable list of fan games that continue the HL legacy.\nHalf-Life remade as a roguelike, approved by Valve, and playable now [PCGamesN]\nThe post Half-Life becomes a roguelike, thanks to modder appeared first on Destructoid.",

This incredible number represents an accumulation of sales on PC and console since the games' Early Access debut back in the summer of 2017.\n\"Following the success of Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania, Evil Empire has been exploring the path forward for the title as a whole,\" said the studio in a celebratory statement. \"With years of successful updates and expansions behind it after taking over live ops of Dead Cells in 2019, the studio is tinkering with its time-tested methodology, experimenting with ideas for future updates and new ways for fans to enjoy one of their favorite roguelikes.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBBwIHYm8Mw&ab_channel=MotionTwin\nThe studio also revealed that plans are in motion to develop new updates and DLC for Dead Cells for the foreseeable future — with new content drops planned until at least 2025. Just recently, Dead Cells fans were able to enjoy the aforementioned Return to Castlevania DLC, which saw Dead Cells partner with one of the foremost titles in the Metroidvania genre, bringing familiar locales, enemies, and bosses to the title.\nOutside of the digital realm, Dead Cells is also being adapted for the tabletop crowd, with an official board game in the works at Scorpion Masque. This project opened its crowdfunding campaign with a $30,000 USD target, and successfully raised around half a million dollars in less than fifteen minutes.

In response, as spotted by Eurogamer, Insomniac community director James Stevenson confirmed \"it is new.\"\nIt's a relatively small, tucked-away cameo that appears on a television early in the movie. I saw Spider-Verse over the weekend and noticed some gameplay, but figured it was just a plug of some already seen footage. It's hard to actually discern anything major out of it, aside from seeing some mechanical arms on Peter's suit.\nSo while it's a neat little easter egg, I don't think you need to buy a movie ticket just to see some new gameplay.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrPZSq5YXqc\nDoing whatever a spider can\nIt's not like we need new gameplay right away, anyways. We got a pretty big spotlight on the new Spider-Man game from Insomniac at the recent PlayStation Showcase. We saw both Peter and Miles, and how the game will swap between the two at key moments for its story.\nKraven, Lizard, and more also pop up during the spotlight too. It's certainly not as laden with Spider-People as Across the Spider-Verse is, but it's looking like Insomniac has a lot of Spidey action planned for this fall.\nMeanwhile, while you shouldn't pick up a ticket for the gameplay cameo, you should definitely still go see Across the Spider-Verse. It was an absolutely phenomenal achievement in animation and a great follow-up to one of my personal favorite super-hero films. It's worth your time, with or without the Spider-Man 2 gameplay tease.\nThe post There’s some new Spider-Man 2 footage in Across the Spider-Verse appeared first on Destructoid.",

Go!\nApogee Entertainment and New Blood Interactive have announced that a release date has been nailed down for Nightdive Studios Rise of the Triad: Ludicrous Edition. It’s set to launch on PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC on July 31, 2023.\nOriginally intended to be a sequel to 1992’s seminal FPS, Wolfenstein 3D, Rise of the Triad absolutely pushed the game’s engine as far as it could go. I’m more of a fan of Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold, but it’s hard not to appreciate Rise of the Triad’s insane attention to detail. Tom Hall and the developers at Apogee went completely nuts with this one, ensuring that it’s memorable for its over-the-top nature.\nhttps://youtu.be/OqDedfEgprs\nI remember playing it on my cousin’s computer and having him point out the small details. Heatseeking missiles, for example, would home in on torches if there weren’t any enemies present. It would be greatly overshadowed by the release of Doom the previous year. However, Rise of the Triad manages to stand apart as an infectiously enjoyable romp.\nIt’s in good hands with Nightdive Studios. They’ve made the effort to transport the game into their fantastic proprietary KEX Engine. Rise of the Triad: Ludicrous Edition supports all the “modern creature comforts” of 4K resolution (where supported), 60FPS framerate, and 11-player deathmatches. There’s also a brand new episode, a level creator, the expansion packs included, and restored content from the betas.\nHeck. Yes.\nRise of the Triad: Ludicrous Edition comes to PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC on July 31, 2023. You can try it out right now, as a demo has just dropped on Steam (Oops! Instead, it is going to be available June 19th during Steam Next Fest).\nThe post Rise of the Triad: Ludicrous Edition fires its heat-seekers on July 31 appeared first on Destructoid.",

And the black-and-green brand is promising to show off a whole host of titles, most of which will be sporting \"in-engine\" footage.\n\"None of our first-party games in the show are full CG trailers,\" said Xbox VP of Gaming Aaron Greenberg on Twitter. \"Everything is either in-game footage, in-engine footage, or in-game footage with some cinematics. Each of our trailers will be labeled so it is hopefully clear for our fans.\"\nhttps://twitter.com/aarongreenberg/status/1665503326853648387?s=20\nWhile Greenberg was simply replying to a fan's query, it should be noted that the comments are, ironically, a stark contrast to PlayStation's State of Play presentation from May, which featured over an hour of wall-to-wall trailers and reveals, but leaned heavily on cinematic sequences, showing little actual gameplay for a lot of its most-exciting titles.\nMore directly, however, Greenberg says that the Xbox Games Showcase will feature \"no movie trailers\", which is a clear tongue-in-cheek reference to Sony spotlighting the upcoming Gran Turismo film during its stream. A funny gag for sure, but to be fair if I was Sony putting together a summer showcase, why wouldnt't you promote the film based on one of your biggest and most lucrative brands?\nAnywhoo, the Xbox Games Showcase takes place June 11 at 10:00 PT / 13:00 ET / 18:00 BST. We will, of course, be on hand to bring you all of the biggest and brightest news from the event.

In its place, they are offering a free download for one of their other ports.\nThere's no sugarcoating this: That’s a bummer! I loved 2004's Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2: The Sith Lord right up until it suddenly crumbled to pieces as it approached its conclusion. KOTOR2 was blatantly unfinished. The denouement and climax are rolled together sloppily in a single character just standing in a room. I’ve seen rushed games before, but I have never seen one that just nosedives from really good to barely a game in what feels like mere moments.\nhttps://twitter.com/AspyrMedia/status/1664784147867480070?s=20\nThe Restored Content DLC was supposed to take all the cut content that couldn’t be compiled into the “finished” product and assemble it in a way that the developers at Obsidian intended. There are fan-compiled mods for the PC version you can use to get a more complete experience, but it looks like the console version is just going to have to remain in an incomplete state.\nWhat game should you get instead of the KOTOR 2 DLC?\nSince there’s the possibility that people bought Knights of the Old Republic 2 on Switch specifically for the chance to play the Restored Content (and I know that there are some), Aspyr is offering a “complimentary” key for anyone who purchased before the announcement. Might I suggest Star Wars: Episode 1 Racer? It is way better than it sounds.\nTo get your complimentary key, simply visit support.aspyr.com and submit a request along with proof of purchase.

Released in 2010, this indie survival horror title quickly became one of the most terrifying games of its era. Now, the developer has announced that modding for it just became a lot easier through the Steam Workshop.\nIn a recent post on the Amnesia page, Frictional has said that in anticipation of Amnesia: The Bunker, which is due out in just a couple of days, the team decided to enable the publishing of custom mods via Steam. The studio acknowledges that modding has become a huge part of the community. Places like Nexus Mods have been a great source of new content, but now there's a new repository to get your modifications for Dark Descent.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOhvfP5aEXU\nWhile survival horror has always been around, it was the first Amnesia release that really shook things up. By introducing a mechanic that makes it impossible to defend yourself, the game became a test of mettle. Along with Minecraft, it pretty much birthed the early days of the YouTube Let's Play video, as fans would challenge themselves to see how far they could get before becoming too scared.\nSince then, there have been additional entries in the series, but none could quite match the unbridled terror of the OG. There may never be anything quite like Amnesia: The Dark Descent again, but with The Bunker coming to Xbox Games Pass, there's going to be plenty of horror fans who will be excited about the new game.\nThe post Amnesia: The Dark Descent now supports Steam Workshop appeared first on Destructoid.",

The timing would suggest that the reveal was initially set to take place during this week's Summer Game Fest event, but has now been delayed to the following week.\nhttps://twitter.com/Knoebelbroet/status/1665599011389054978?s=20\nSo, what is it? Well, the fact that the clock launched on No More Heroes' anniversary could suggest a new entry in Suda51's lurid action-adventure series. That said, there have been whispers that the studio has been working on a new title for some years now — A video shot at the studio itself last year showed an artist working on a grotesque boss character, leading some to believe a new Shadows of the Damned might be in the works. Although it's been a while since we heard anything of the Lollipop Chainsaw remake, Suda51 and his current staff are not involved with that project, so it is unlikely to pertain to that game.\nWhatever the ultimate reveal turns out to be, all of the prospects are pretty exciting. And, thankfully, we won't have to wait too much longer to find out the truth. We will, of course, bring you all of the details from the June 15 Grasshopper Manufacture reveal right here on Destructoid.\nUntil then, however, let the speculation commence.\nThe post Suda 51’s Grasshopper Manufacture is teasing something for June 15 appeared first on Destructoid.",

You'll have to forgive your pal Moyse for the flying visit this week, as it has been an incredibly busy week, complete with some weekend working - *sadface* - in order to be prepped for this huge launch week. Both Capcom's Street Fighter 6 and Blizzard's Diablo IV are currently swooping into battle, and I have a fair old bit to do ahead of these releases. Still, this weekend should be a bit lighter for me.\nI hope that this week's entry of WBP? finds you all in a good place, and that you all have equally calmer weekends lined up. If you're free for the next couple of days, I hope that they are joyful, and that you get some quality R'n'R emboldened by quality entertainment. And if you are, unfortu…",

          "description": "The true test of ergonomics returns\nAnother pretty special release has joined the Arcade Archives release, as publisher Hamster rolls out the intensely puzzling and bizarrely titled Tetris The Absolute Grand Master 2 Plus — now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.\nDeveloped by Arika and published by the last bastion of the coin-op, Psikyo, Tetris The Absolute Grand Master 2 Plus, (known in the community as simply \"TGM2\" or \"TAP\"), hit Japanese arcades in 2000, launched as a last-minute update to the original TGM2 board. Much like its predecessor, Tetris The Grand Master, TGM2 is an expert-level iteration of Alexey Pajitnov's classic block-busting puzzler, and tasks players with using adaptation and forward-thinking to manage a rapidly filling playfield of Tetrominos.\nCheck out a bout of TGM2 T.A. Death in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Masterjun3.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcjqNkiT8q0\nTGM2 retains the complex gameplay of its predecessor but adds a casual player-friendly \"Normal\" mode, as well as an evolved edition of \"Master\" mode, which features huge acceleration after level 500. Also part of the update is the incredibly challenging \"T.A. Death\" mode, which features fixes 20G gravity settings, as well as a consistently high speed from the get-go. It is considered one of the most difficult challenges in Tetris history. The arrival of TGM2, (and previously TGM), on the Arcade Archives plugs a gap that has been in the collections of Tetris fans the world over for generations.\nWell, at least in an official capacity... Now get droppin'!\nTetris The Absolute Grand Master 2 Plus is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Tetris The Absolute Grand Master 2 Plus drops into the Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

It popularized not only 3D in games but also the concepts of shareware and modding. Doom invited everyone to first experience it, then to do better. This approach paved the way for loads of original games and legitimate careers in the games industry. Taking a look back at the early days of Doom is taking a look at a much less cynical time in the history of the gaming industry.\nBut which game in the Doom series sits atop the throne as the best we've ever seen?

From its humble 1987 Final Fantasy I beginnings to this year’s upcoming tentpole release, Final Fantasy XVI, the series has, in some way, shape, or form, remained prominent for decades. Part of its success likely comes from how easy it is to get into any new mainline game, which is to say every new entry stands alone (save for the few direct sequels). Final Fantasy II isn’t a direct sequel to Final Fantasy I, just like Final Fantasy VII isn’t one to Final Fantasy VI. \nTerms, mechanics, and sometimes even names might be familiar – there are mainstays like chocobos, magic, Cids, and more – but each new entry features its own cast of characters, world, story, and lore.

          "description": "You don't need to play 2020's Final Fantasy VII Remake to enjoy its sequel, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, according to the game's co-director Motuma Toriyama. \nLast week, Square Enix and the official Final Fantasy VII Twitter account began releasing new details about the upcoming sequel, answering one question each day. On day one, we learned Rebirth is \"progressing smoothly.\" Day 2 and Day 3 were less exciting, teasing that players will have a \"high degree of freedom, experiencing a myriad of different stories\" and that players \"will witness a chain of narrative events that lie at the very heart of the Final Fantasy VII story.\" \nFor Day 4, the question is: Do I need to play Final Fantasy VII Remake to enjoy Final Fantasy VII Rebirth? And here's Toriyama's answer: \"No – we have made preparations so that players who did not get a chance to play the first game can fully enjoy Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.\" \nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth\n#FF7R pic.twitter.com/vsmJZvDljw\nJune 5, 2023\nIf I had to guess, Rebirth will feature an introductory cutscene or minimovie that summarizes the events of the first game but only time will tell.\nRebirth is slated to release this winter, although an official release date has not yet been revealed. Considering it's Final Fantasy \"7,\" many are speculating that Square Enix's daily QA will end on Day 7, which would be this Thursday, June 8. That's also the same day Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest presentation will air so perhaps we'll be seeing some footage of Rebirth during that, or at least maybe learning when we can play this game.\nFor more, check out Game Informer's June Summer Game Fest 2023 schedule, and then read our Final Fantasy VII Remake review to find out why you probably should play it before Rebirth. Check out our thoughts on Final Fantasy VII Remake's Episode Intermission DLC after that. \nAre you excited for Final Fantasy VII Rebirth? Let us know in the comments below!",

According to the vice president of Xbox games marketing at Microsoft Aaron Greenberg, during the showcase, none of the company's first-party games will be \"full CG trailers,\" as reported by GamesRadar. \nHe goes on to explain this means every first-party trailer will be \"either in-game footage, in-engine footage, or in-game footage with some cinematic\" and each trailer will be labeled appropriately so it's clear what we're looking at. Greenberg tweeted this in response to someone poking fun at showcase tendencies to rely heavily on CGI trailers. \nNone of our first party games in the show are full CG trailers. Everything is either in-game footage, in-engine footage, or in-game footage with some cinematics. Each of our trailers will be labeled so it is hopefully clear for our fans.\nJune 4, 2023\nThis all started with Greenberg quote-tweeting an Xbox tweet that highlights that the Xbox Games Showcase is live in seven days (well, six days now) on June 11. He quote-tweeted this Xbox tweet to reveal that the showcase is \"roughly two hours of non stop games, games, games, games, and Starfield.\" \n[Source: GamesRadar]\nWhich game do you hope to see appear during the Xbox Games Showcase?

Though we haven’t heard a peep about the game since its reveal last June, we could be getting a release date soon. \nIn a tweet, Kitase answered the question of how Rebirth is progressing by simply stating, “Development is progressing smoothly and according to plan. We are currently working on nailing down a release date for the game.” \nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth\npic.twitter.com/O4KdGlh4gy\nJune 2, 2023\nWhile not much, the update is an exciting one if things are going as well as Kitase claims. As for when we could hear about a launch date, Summer Game Fest is around the corner, and Square Enix is one of the confirmed partners for the event, so there's a small chance Rebirth will make an appearance. \nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth is currently slated to release this winter for PlayStation 5 and picks up after the events of Final Fantasy VII Remake and its Intermission story expansion. Though it follows Cloud and Co.’s journey beyond Midgar, the cinematic reveal trailer makes it tough to know what to expect given Remake's events (other than Cloud and Sephiroth taking a lot of strolls together), so hopefully, we'll be getting another glimpse of the project sooner than later. \nFor more, be sure to read our reviews of Final Fantasy VII Remake and the Intermission expansion in the Intergrade version. Square Enix is also gearing up to launch Final Fantasy XVI on June 22, which graces Game Informer's cover this month.

The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it?

Nintendo's description of the game says players can split into teams \"and see which group can win a certain number of games first,\" while also noting that many of the games have several variations that change the rules or add extra challenge. \nEverybody 1-2-Switch hits Switch on June 30. Both the physical and digital edition will cost $29.99. \nWhile this is a surprise official announcement from Nintendo, this isn't the first time we've heard of Everybody 1-2-Switch. Former Game Informer and Fanbyte editor Imran Khan wrote a report while at Fanbyte about this sequel. In that report, Khan spoke to several sources who said the game was complete but unannounced because of how badly it was testing. Nintendo didn't know what to do with the game, with many fearing releasing it in its current state could harm the company's reputation for releasing great games. \nIt's unclear what's changed between that report and now – perhaps nothing has changed and Nintendo is using the excitement around The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom to quietly release Everybody 1-2-Switch.

The original Asgard's Wrath is one of VR's biggest, most ambitious (and well-reviewed) games. The sequel picks up where the story of the first game left off while adding all kinds of new mechanics. You can find more on Asgard's Wrath 2 in the upcoming issue of Game Informer's magazine, where we spoke with the game's director.

This tattoo connects more widely to the world of FFXVI, Valisthea, and magic’s place in it. \nDuring my cover story trip to Tokyo, Japan, to speak to developer Creative Business Unit III, I learned a lot about magic in FFXVI and how it affects Clive’s life and everyone in this world. The special tattoo on Clive’s face is the mark of a Bearer, which indicates he can use magic. This might seem like a great ability, but the nations of Valisthea view Bearers as something other than human.

Prosecutors also demanded that Naka pay a fine of 2.5 million yen (roughly $17,900) as well as a supplementary penalty of 170 million yen (roughly $1.2 million). Naka's defense asked that this fine and prison sentence be reduced, but a final decision on the matter isn't expected until July 7, VGC reports. \nNaka, who also directed Balan Wonderworld, was arrested in November in connection to an insider trading investigation involving the reveal of a new Dragon Quest game. Naka was accused of purchasing 10,000 shares worth 2.8 million yen (roughly $20,000) in Aiming, the company behind the new mobile Dragon Quest game. \nThen, less than a month later, Naka was re-arrested on a second charge of insider trading, this time involving the now-defunct mobile battle royale, Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier. Naka reportedly purchased 120,000 shares in Ateam, the developer behind the game, for approximately 144.7 million yen (more than $1 million). \nNow, Naka has been charged and could face more than two and a half years in prison alongside more than $1 million in fines. A final decision on his charges is expected next month. \n[Source: Abema Times via VGC]",

The presumption might be that developer Creative Business Unit III wanted this game to have more violence to accompany its new action-heavy combat, but that’s not the case. The team put little thought into the rating – it just came naturally, according to various members of CBUIII I spoke to for our FFXVI cover story. \n“We actually get this question kind of a lot – people ask us if the rating went up because [we] wanted to make a more violent game, and the answer to that is no,” producer Naoki Yoshida says. “On the outside, it doesn’t appear [the rating system] has changed.

          "description": "For a licensed racing game, 2021’s Hot Wheels Unleashed was a fun and respectable debut, and now we’ll get to see how developer Milestone builds on that foundation with an upcoming sequel. \nHot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged arrives on October 19 and retains the fun “little toy car in a big world” presentation with new additions under the hood. Players can now get behind the wheel of motorcycles and ATVs, and the game has over 130 vehicles total at launch.\nPlayers race across five diverse environments using new skills: double jumping and lateral dashing. The double jump can be performed at any time to leap over rivals and obstacles, while dashing is great for sideswiping nearby opponents or dodging hazards. Milestone touts increased interactivity between vehicles and objects on and off the track, and playstyles can be customized using perks earned by earning skill points. \n\n\nModes include a revamped story-driven campaign starring four original characters, complete with animated cutscenes. Other challenges include events designed to test players’ skills such as drifting and evading crashes. For online multiplayer, the game supports cross-play (except on Switch), and players can now create friend parties. Local two-player splitscreen also makes a return. \nThe popular creation suite from the first game now features a refined Track Editor with expanded features and a Livery Editor update introducing the Sticker Editor to create and save custom patterns and shapes. Best of all, all user-generated content will be sharable cross-platform at launch, though it's unclear if any player-made content from the original can be imported into this game. \nHot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. Check out some of the sequel's cars in the screenshot gallery below.",

It seems one might be on the way. \nAccording to a new report on Sudbury.com, a news organization that covers the Greater Sudbury area in Canada, which is where Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City was filmed, Sudbury is receiving an $11 million injection from the provincial government, as reported by PCGamesN. This government is funding 20 local projects through the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund Corporation and while a sequel to Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City hasn't officially been named as one of those 20 projects, there is one called \"Umbrella Chronicles,\" and it's receiving $2 million. \nIf you're familiar with the Resident Evil series, you know \"Umbrella Chronicles\" is likely a nod to The Umbrella Chronicles spinoff game. Add in that the film company behind \"Umbrella Chronicles\" is Raccoon HG Film Productions, the same company behind Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City, and the picture gets a little clearer: we might be getting a sequel. \nIt's important to note this isn't an official confirmation of a sequel. Perhaps Raccoon HG Film Productions is making a different Resident Evil movie unattached to Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City. Only time will tell. \nIn the meantime, watch our interview with two of the 2021 film's stars and then check out this featurette from Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City with some behind-the-scenes details. \n[Source: Sudbury.com via PCGamesN]\nDo you want a sequel to Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City?

In our review, we scored the game a 9 out of 10, with former editor-in-chief Andrew Reiner writing, \"It’s a great continuation of the series that is just a joy to play. It steals your eye with its stunning vistas, makes you care about the characters, and is loaded to the hilt with fan service (especially in the alternate dimension and a weapon you have to assemble).\"\nWill you be checking out Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart on Steam?

          "description": "Designing combat in a Final Fantasy game seems like a double-edged sword. On one hand, you likely want to appeal to the fans of the series, and on the other, you want to attract new players. But it’s impossible to please everyone when making big changes like developer Creative Business Unit III is doing with Final Fantasy XVI – using a real-time action combat system that couldn’t be further from the series’ classic turn-based roots. \nAs someone who loves the franchise’s turn-based format and its more action-forward design as of late, and as someone who’s played FFXVI for more than five hours at this point, I’m quite pleased with the combat. It’s fast-paced, action-heavy, and perhaps most importantly, fitting of this world and these characters. I especially like the singular focus on Clive,…",

          "description": "The October 2022 announcement of Silent Hill: Ascension, an interactive streaming series from Genvid Entertainment and Konami, raised some eyebrows from fans but provided little in the way of details. Today, Genvid broke its silence by not only giving us new details on the series but also a trailer.\nIn this series, which will unfold simultaneously across the globe, those watching can help decide the fates of Ascension's main characters. This means that as the story plays out, the audience will have a say in who survives the surely horrific story, who will be redeemed or damned by their actions, and who will suffer the almost certainly ghastly consequences. According to Genvid Entertainment, not even the developers will know the results of the story until it unfolds.\nSilent Hill: Ascension features an ensemble of new characters, monsters, and locations within the Silent Hill universe. Genvid has crafted a real-time interactive system that allows viewers from around the world to decide these characters' fates within the narrative the studio has crafted. Beginning later in 2023, fans can tune in to live story moments where each day is different based on audience interactions. \nSilent Hill: Ascension is set to stream later this year. If this unique concept has piqued your interest, you can check out the reveal trailer below.",

          "description": "Final Fantasy XVI’s combat is fast, chaotic, and, most importantly, fun. There are plenty of combos to pull off, and in just the small taste of the action during my cover story trip to Square Enix’s Tokyo, Japan, office, I saw so much variance in setting up Clive’s combative abilities that I can’t wait to see what others do in-game. \nI also watched combat director Ryota Suzuki play through some of the most challenging encounters in the game, and unsurprisingly, he excelled, taking maybe one or two hits in the 20 minutes he played. He used combos I didn’t really comprehend – admittedly, he was playing at a much later portion of the game than I had hands-on access with – and it got me thinking: is he excited to see what players do with FFXVI’s combat, much like I was sitting there watching him pull off intricate combos against myriad enemies? \n“I’ve always tried to give players a lot of freedom when it comes to the controls and the action in the game, and give them lots of options that they can take and then do their own thing with,” Suzuki tells me. “So I’m expecting that there’s going to be a lot of weird things that they’re going to do with certain abilities. I can’t say what those abilities are, but I already have a few ideas because I’ve left a lot of things open-ended in that way. \n“I’m really excited to see what players will do with them because there are definitely things that I didn’t expect, but I do like putting that stuff out there so that they have stuff to play with and surprise me with. When they do things I expected, I’m happy, but I’m also really happy when they [...] do something that is completely unexpected. It’s one of the exciting things about being a developer.”\nLike Suzuki, I look forward to seeing what far more advanced players do with FFXVI’s combat, and fortunately, we have less than a month to go. \nFor more, be sure to check out Game Informer’s exclusive FFXVI coverage hub by clicking the banner below.",

Even before mounting on his included stand, Prime stands at 16 inches tall.\nThe team even brought in legendary voice actor Peter Cullen to reprise his role and record brand-new lines for the character to spout.\nThe new Rise of the Beasts Optimus Prime limited edition collectible will put you back a hefty sum; it’s currently on a preorder sale of $699 (instead of the regular price of $899).
