          "description": "A look back over the career of the NES and SNES' lead architect.\nThe sad news broke today that Masayuki Uemura, the lead architect on the NES and Super NES consoles, died on 6th December at the age of 78. Uemura was an instrumental figure in the formation of Nintendo as the video game company we know and love today — his hardware design credits date back to the 1970s, and he also has a fair list of software producer credits to his name. It's no exaggeration to say that millions of players across the world have his engineering skill and expertise to thank for the systems we played in our youth and the great memories we formed with them.\nBorn in 1943, Uemura grew up in post-war Japan and developed an interest in playing with and constructing his own toys from a young age, partly due to the scarcity of new products available in the years following the end of World War II. He studied at the Chiba Institute of Technology and upon graduating he began his career at Sharp Corporation before eventually joining Nintendo in 1972, thanks to his relationship with Gunpei Yokoi. The two met and worked together while Yokoi was investigating Sharp's technology for use in light gun games in the early 1970s and Uemura evidently impressed Nintendo's chief designer at the time.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "You've met with a terrible fate, haven't you?\nWhen you get right down to it, almost every game consists of a very simple loop. For example, every Mario 2D platformer ultimately is nothing more than having the famed plumber jump over obstacles and run to the right. We’re rarely focused on the repetition, however, because it’s the new things that happen on each new trip ‘around the loop’ that makes it so interesting. Loop Hero is the ultimate example of this; Devolver Digital’s latest release is an RPG that’s focused on… walking in circles. And yet it’s impossible to put down.\nLoop Hero puts you in the role of a nameless hero who’s charged with bringing the world back after it was destabilized and eradicated by a mysterious lich. The world is now a formless void filled with bits and pieces of what used to be, and even the hero’s memories of it have been eaten away, too. Luckily, your hero has the unique ability to cause things to stop fading, so you set out on a quest to slay the cosmic foes that ruined everything and hopefully find some way to bring it all back again.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Anything with a mandatory cost is excluded, as are mods or anything dependent on another purchase. The result is a list of games that run the gamut, from ARPGs to management, 2D platformers to co-op first-person shooters. \nIf you'd prefer to consume a version of this list via the magic of moving pictures, you can do so with this handy video we've put together:\n Read more",

But if you can stand the two hour waits and dreaded 2002 error then you’re in for a grand, if a little slow-starting, adventure.\nFinal Fantasy XIV: Endwalker is the final chapter in the story arc of warring gods Zodiark and Hydaelyn, and sees you trot across the globe to make new friends, fight old foes, and get some space travel under your belt. It’s huge. So huge that it’s going to take a few more weeks to soak it all in and do a full review justice. Between the queue times and sheer scale and finality of the story, Endwalker is a lengthy undertaking.\nRead more",

It was a game in which I was perpetually lonely and confused and being battered to death by carcinogenic poultry, but it must have been a profitable enough venture on its own terms to warrant a follow-up. That follow-up is Elex II, which is still several months away from release right now, but one I've been playing an early preview build of recently, showing off the first chapter of the game.\nI was talking to Graham (RPS in peace) about this and he said: \"Eventually one of these RPG sci-fi fantasy things will get close enough to being a BioWare game that it makes loads of money.\" This being the games equivalent of monkeys and typewriters. But although I agreed with Graham at the time, I think comparing it to BioWare might be mistaking the particular appeal of Elex II. It would be too simple to say that I \"enjoyed\" the hours I have spent with it so far. I didn't not enjoy it. I mostly came away respecting it for how little it respected me.

It’s a unique combination of deck-building and turn-based strategy, presented in satisfying and stylish 3D animation. Sort of Superhot meets Slay The Spire. \r\n\n\r\n  In Fights In Tight Spaces, you play as an anonymous secret agent with the aim of assassinating bosses, while moving through the game's multiple chapters. On the way to each boss are several smaller encounters, which act as opportunities for you to get some practice in. You take turns planning the best way to take out roomfuls of enemies, and eventually upgrade your skills and continue the cycle.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's described as the largest update to Dead Cells yet, and is designed as an ending to the route started by the two previous DLCs (The Bad Seed and Fatal Falls).

This is the fifth patch for the game since its initial launch near the end of July 2021. This one includes fixes for various crashes, increases to the stability in co-op play, improvements to the audio, as well as other miscellaneous changes. \r\n\n\r\nThe patch also adds a new feature called Transmogrification, which you’re probably familiar with if you’ve played games like Destiny 2 or World Of Warcraft. In the words of Neon Giant, this’ll allow players to “change their appearance to match the visual style of any armour currently in their inventory by visiting the Stylist and paying a small fee.” Once that’s done, you can equip any armour you want, and your character’s look won’t change.\r\n \nRead more",

Sonic embarks on an adventure to the Starfall Islands, a collection of forests, deserts, waterfalls, among other biomes. It's unsure what to expect, but based on the trailer, Sonic has some titanic opposition standing in his way. Fans of Sonic comics should be happy to learn that Ian Flynn, lead writer for IDW’s Sonic the Hedgehog comic series and former head writer for the Archie Comics Sonic run, is penning Frontiers' story. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nSonic Frontiers doesn’t have an exact release date, but it’s coming during the 2022 holiday season for current and last-gen consoles. It’s cool to see Sonic tackling a true open-world for the first time.

Of greatest significance, that means that the Hive foes you defeat can come back from death after you take them down.\nThat was the focus of the new video that debuted tonight, comprised of in-game footage that shows off a fireteam confronting a Hive Knight Guardian, accompanied by a live-action debrief between one of the human Guardians who was present and Ikora Rey, in her role as a leader of the Vanguard. The fireteam seems to destroy the Hive Knight, but then it comes back from death. The combat must eventually turn out to the better, as the returning fireteam member has the remains of the Hive Ghost, but it’s clear that things did not go well on the mission.\nAfter the trailer, we also learned that the footage shown was from the opening mission of the new expansion.\nDestiny 2: The Witch Queen is set to release across all platforms on February 22. It’s been a long wait for a major new expansion, but the scope and drama of Savathûn’s big coming-out party has us excited.\nClick here to watch embedded media",

          "description": "Bokeh Game Studio, the new independent development house headed up by Silent Hill director Keiichiro Toyama, finally unveiled its debut project, Slitterhead, tonight at The Game Awards. Predictably, it's grotesque. \nThe trailer opens with a man walking down a typical city alley before running into a woman. Shortly thereafter, we get our first glimpse at what is ostensibly a Slitterhead, as the woman's face tears open and her body mutates into a skeletal monstrosity. From there, a bizarre compilation of scenes plays, including, but not limited to, police being chopped in half by similar skeletal beasts, a man in a motorcycle helmet conjuring blood into a sword, another man in his pajamas falling through the sky, and more. We end on a shot of a densely-packed apartment complex as a plane flies closely overhead, before zooming in on an older woman whose face has torn open – much like the others – though this time it shuts, leaving the woman looking normal.\nCheck out the full trailer below:\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nAside from what we saw in the trailer, we don't know too much about Slitterhead, other than what Toyama's hinted at in past interviews. Back in June, it was revealed he was working on a choice-driven game. In December 2020, Toyama told IGN Japan his next project (ostensibly this one) would be released in 2023.",

Games announced the project with a small teaser that confirmed Monolith, best known for Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, would be acting as the developer. \nThe trailer, which you can watch above, didn't give us much information, but it did begin with Diana's mother, Hippolyta, calling Diana home, saying a threat comes to their shores. It looks like Wonder Woman will have a big weight on her shoulders as she'll have to restore what's been broken and make allies. \"You are a hero, but you can be more,\" her mother says. Her shiny red, blue, and gold armor flashes with the iconic W,  and we then see her lasso in all its glory.\nThe trailer ends by saying: \"You can be a leader,\" which makes us curious how Monolith will challenge us with that task, especially since the brief description spoke about uniting old enemies and forging new bonds. Monolith is the studio that brought us the famous nemesis system, after all, so we wouldn't be surprised if it had some clever ideas for Woman Woman.\nThe trailer's Youtube description shed a little more light, saying Wonder Woman is an open-world action-adventure game where she'll have to unite two worlds.  It's also confirmed to be a single-player game, with an original story set in the DC Universe. The description also said the game is powered by the nemesis system, so at the very least, we can count on that to enhance the experience.\nNo platforms were verified at this time, but we'll update the story when they're revealed.",

However, it appears Final Fantasy 7 Remake will be exclusive to the Epic Games Store, or at least, a non-EGS version has not been detailed. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nThe trailer that aired during The Game Awards 2021 began with an Epic Games Store logo and the closing screen that appeared at the end of the trailer had no mention of Steam. So, if you want to play Final Fantasy 7 Remake on PC, you’ll have to buy it on the Epic Games Store next week for now. One neat thing about the PC version of this game is that it includes the Intermission content featured in the Intergrade version of the game on PS5.  \nThat means you’ll be able to play as Yuffie and infiltrate a Shinra facility as the famed ninja on PC. You’ll also get to play as Cloud, Aerith, and more through the base story of Final Fantasy 7 Remake, which happens to be great. You can read about why in Game Informer’s Final Fantasy 7 Remake review.

Rumored in one form or another for years, the new game promises to finally give us some answers about the enigmatic writer and his adventures – or maybe just more questions.\nIn the trailer, we hear narration from a mysterious voice, talking about expectations for a story, but the realization that sometimes a story isn’t what you expect or want it to be. As the camera zooms in on a single figure in a desolate town, we hear the phrase: “This story is a monster, and monsters wear many faces.”\nThe new trailer finally gave us a first look at Alan Wake II, including a release date of 2023. Remedy’s creative director, Sam Lake, was on site at The Game Awards to announce that this sequel is actually a survival/horror game, moving away from its action roots.\nUnfortunately, Remedy’s Lake also revealed that we likely won’t learn anything else about the game until summer of 2022.

When the giant beast walks into the cave, subsequently collapsing on the wall, the team attacks the monster, setting it ablaze. Soon after, Senua's team goes up in flames, as the beast slams its way around, trying to strike back at its aggressors. Spotting Senua and the remaining allies left living, the crew retreats, trying desperately to run away and retaliate as best it can. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nSenua and her team's efforts to bring down the beast all fall short as it continues to chase them outside of the cave, smashing surrounding structures. The trailer ends with the creature asking Senua for help. Senua replies, saying, \"I know you,\" as one of the voices in her head says \"It's you.\" The trailer ends there.\nHost Geoff Keighley said at the end of the trailer that what we were watching wasn't a cinematic, but real gameplay, though it was hard to tell how interactive anything shown off in the trailer actually was – the camera was constantly whipping around during the trailer, seemingly indicating at least part of it was, in fact, cinematics. At the very least, it stands to reason everything we were seeing was running in-engine. \nHellblade II: Senua's Sacrifice will be released on Xbox Series X/S and PC.

It’s been a long time since Homeworld 2’s release way back in September of 2003, but fans have hung their hopes on the exciting prospect of a new game on the way from Blackbird Interactive. Today’ Game Awards pre-show presentation brought us a new look at the mysterious title, in the form of a new trailer.\nIn the video, we’re greeted by a remixed version of Samuel Barber’s \"Adagio for Strings,\" a piece of music renowned for high-drama appearances in a variety of media. As the music plays, we’re treated to a bevy of different spacecraft, moving both through atmospheric conditions as well as in deep space. We see a lot of beauty shots of a variety of ships, but we also are treated to a variety of battle shots that include larger capital ships and smaller fighters blowing each other into space debris.\nInterspersed with the footage are glimpses of a long-haired woman seemingly suspended in some sort of chamber, ably recalling imagery from the earlier games – very possibly an appearance of Karan from the original games.\nWe know from an accompanying press release that the game is set generations after the original games as a standalone release, and set in a galaxy that has enjoyed long year years of success thanks to a large Hyperspace Gate Network, but that those gates are now failing.\n“Homeworld 3 is the realization of the vision of what we set out to create in the Homeworld series, with modern technology allowing us to push beyond our wildest dreams of large-scale dynamic space combat packed with emotional sci-fi storytelling,” says Rob Cunningham, CEO of Blackbird Interactive.\nIt’s not much information to go on, but it is exciting to see the return of such a classic real-time strategy sci-fi franchise.

          "description": "What makes a good shooter? Immediate answers might include punchy phrases/words like “gun feel” or “kit customization.” Even so, it’s hard to define the gratification that comes with securing that coveted victory in ranked multiplayer or surviving a seemingly never-ending onslaught in single-player horde mode. A good shooter tends to contain a smorgasbord of enticing components – gripping atmosphere, weapon/ability balancing, enjoyable arenas, etc. Regardless of style (e.g., FPS, third-person, top-down), the aforementioned features tend to mesh well with polished gameplay, sweeping narratives, and new or improved mechanics. If you feel at home sprinting through multilayered environments, mowing down adversaries with precision and cunning, then the ten games on this list are definitely wort…",

The Game Awards 2021 promises to be a night to remember, featuring a massive slate of announcements, the crowning of a new Game of the Year winner, and even a musical performance by Sting (what the gamers are really here for). To celebrate the evening's festivities, we're going live and covering it all over on Twitch starting at 6:15 p.m. CT!\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nWe know you'll be there watching along with us, but what else will happen during the biggest award show of the year? For starters, we already know who has a chance at the big prizes such as Best Performance, Best Game Direction, and the highly sought-after Game of the Year award. Deathloop, Metroid Dread, Psychonauts 2, Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, and Resident Evil Village have a shot at the big prize, and without a clear-cut favorite like The Last of Us Part II in 2020, it could be anyone's award this year.\nOn top of the array of award winners, The Game Awards 2021 is set to have a metric ton of announcements and reveals featuring some of the biggest titles in the industry. We already know Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, Tiny Tina's Wonderworld, and whatever the next Sonic game is will make an appearance, but what else does host Geoff Keighley and company have up their sleeves? Will Elden Ring be making another appearance? Will we hear from early-2022 juggernauts such as Pokémon Legends: Arceus or Horizon Forbidden West? Only time will tell.\nOn the Game Informer side, your hosts for the evening will be none other than Alex Stadnik and Prima Games editor Jesse Vitelli. The official show kicks off at 7 p.m. CT, but we'll be starting things early at 6:15 p.m. CT to cover some predictions we have and watch the preshow along with you!

While that’s true, what’s at the heart of the Halo franchise does not change – it’s Master Chief, Cortana, some punchy guns that don’t get old, and a soundtrack that never lets up. Throughout the decades, Chief and Cortana (and buddies like Buck) have found themselves on Earth, Sanghelios, hurtling through space, aboard exploding rings, and more. But no matter the locale, we were finishing the fight – even when some of those battles were more grueling than others.\n\nSadly, Chief was absent from the fight the Game Informer editors partook in to rank all the Halo games from worst to best.

He was 78 years old. \nUemura began working for Nintendo in 1972, where he quickly got to work prototyping light-gun games technology that would eventually pave the way for games like Duck Hunt. He then was selected to lead Nintendo’s home console initiative, as noted by Polygon. \nIn 1981, work had begun on what would become the Famicon, perhaps more commonly referred to as the NES in the West. It officially launched two years later in 1983, and then Uemura and the team that helped create the NES got to work on the Super Famicon aka SNES, which would be released in 1990. \nUemura retired in 2004, and he soon began working as a professor at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto, Japan. There, he taught game development. The university will be holding a memorial service for him at a later unannounced date.\n[Source: Polygon]",

Thanks to Fortnite, Gears of War cosmetics are coming to the popular battle royale. That’s because Marcus Fenix and Kait Diaz will be available for purchase in the Fortnite Item Shop later today at 4 p.m. PT/7 p.m. ET. \nAs you can see in the image above, they look as you’d expect, but Kait Diaz also comes with a Winter Orange Style variation. If you play a match of Fortnite on an Xbox Series X/S after purchasing the Marcus Fenix skin, you’ll unlock its Matte Black Style variation, which you can see below.\nMarcus Fenix comes with the Sonic Resonator Back Bling, while Kait Diaz comes with the Reyna’s Pendant Back Bling. Other accessories include the Breaker Mace Pickaxe, the Thumper Pickaxe, the Butcher Cleaver Pickaxe, and the Skiff Glider. You can see each of these items in the image below.\nAlso up for grabs is the Knife Tricks emote, which you can view here, and the Emergence Hole Spray, which comes with “Kait & Marcus Bundle.” You can also purchase the pickaxes, glider, or emotes individually, but if you buy the Emergence Gear Bundle, you’ll get all of them. \nA new Gears of War quest will be added to the Battle Royale later today as well. Players can complete the Delta-One Quests from December 9 to December 17 to unlock the Crimson Omen Spray. To do that, you’ll need to collect three COG tags, crouch behind a barrier, damage an opponent with a melee attack, do shotgun damage to an opponent, and collect Thrashball memorabilia. \nWhile waiting for Gears of War to take over the Fortnite Item Shop, check out this Unreal Engine 5 character skin in Fortnite and then read about how Epic Games is developing Fortnite in Unreal Engine 5. Check out these recently-added Resident Evil skins after that. \nWill you be picking up Marcus Fenix or Kait Diaz in Fortnite today? Let us know in the comments below!",

Moreover, I’m disappointed how the transparency for the future of Arena has all but disappeared this year.\nLast week, Wizards announced more changes on the horizon, bringing a bigger focus to exclusive digital cards, mechanics, and formats to Arena. On the bright side, it's neat to see what design spaces Wizards has wanted to explore that wouldn't pan out well with physical cards.

          "description": "Assassin's Creed Valhalla is getting quite a bit smaller with a new update next week. Not content-wise, that's all staying put, but rather the file size of the game will shrink on all platforms thanks to a data restructure. \nNot only will your hard drive or SSD have some spare room after the 1.4.1., Valhalla will feature \"faster loading screen times, improved world data streaming, and overall runtime performance\" compared to previous versions. \nIf you notice that the download sizes are huge, they are! This update requires the full base game to be redownloaded, so plan accordingly to not unexpectedly fly over your data cap. Your DLC, luckily, will not factor into the updating process.\nHere's the data straight from Ubisoft's forum post:\nDownload size from 1.4.0 to 1.4.1:\nPC ~78 GB\nPS4 ~67 GB\nPS5 ~40 GB\nX1 ~62 GB\nXS ~71 GB\nDisc space used after installing 1.4.1:\nPC ~77 GB\nPS4 ~75 GB\nPS5 ~77 GB\nX1 ~63 GB\nXS ~72 GB\nDisc space saved after rebase:\nPC ~34 GB\nPS4 ~30 GB\nPS5 ~13 GB\nX1 ~30 GB\nXS ~44 GB\nIt's a little strange to see a complete data restructure pushed to a game that's been available for a year, but it's also a welcome sight with the ballooning sizes of games. Potentially shrinking a game by a third of its size is a commendable feat, and one I hope is considered much earlier in the development process for future games.\nWill you be redownloading AC Valhalla to check out this new update next week? I guess you may not have a choice if you want to play the game with any online connectivity. But let us know in the comments anyway!",

To even hit 4K/60FPS on PC, SMS recommends an Nvidia RTX 3080, which is the highly sought-after GPU that’s basically impossible to purchase at the moment. However, the recommended PC specs for God of War are a lot less taxing, needing only an Nvidia GTX 1060 GPU and an Intel i5-6600K, amongst the usual requirements such as Windows 10. \nHere’s a full look at what you’ll need in your machine to play God of War at various visual fidelities, including minimum, recommended, high, performance, and ultra. \nThe studio also released a new trailer showcasing some of what players can expect in the PC version of God of War, too. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nSome PC-specific features include Nvidia DLSS AI Performance Boost, Nvidia Reflex, AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution, enhanced graphics, and more. \n“Higher-resolution shadows, improved screen space reflections, enhanced Ground Truth Ambient Occlusion (GTAO) and Screen Space Directional Occlusion (SSDO), alongside highly detailed assets and rendering solutions means God of War on PC will be a beautiful, crisp visual experience,” SMS’ blog post reads. \nThe PC version of God of War was announced in October, just over half a year after the PlayStation 5 update for God of War was revealed. That update brought 60 FPS, 4K Checkerboard Resolution, and 2160p resolutions to the game, and if you aren’t able to play it there, you can get similar performances soon when it hits PC on January 14 next year.

          "description": "Cue the gregorian chant. Tell your boss you’re sick. It’s finally time. Halo Infinite’s campaign is here, and to celebrate the momentous event, we’re streaming the first two hours of the game live on Twitch starting at 12:30 CT!\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nThe return of Master Chief has long been both anticipated and given fans of the series anxiety after a controversial first showing and a subsequent delay. But those fearful of whether or not Infinite will be a return for form should rest easy. According to our very own Matt Miller, the latest Halo game sticks the landing. In his review, he says: \nHalo Infinite walks a narrow line between old and new and does it with as much success as I’ve seen from a game. As one of the most recognizable “feels” of play, it’s confidently nostalgic and rooted in an established legacy, ably recalling the earliest games in the series. Whether it’s the satisfying stick of a plasma grenade, the haughty cries of a sword-wielding stealth Elite, or the gradual discovery of a mysterious Halo ring, Infinite is an homage to Combat Evolved, 20 years after that first release. Simultaneously, 343 Industries’ new game charts its own course. Equipment like the incredibly satisfying grappleshot, open-world elements that inject increased opportunities for exploration, and freeform base assaults that challenge players to think creatively – all of these and more help the formula stay fresh and relevant. The balancing act works, and this is the best a Halo game has felt in over a decade.\n\nToday we’ll be showing off the very first levels and playing for about two hours. We’ll be taking requests in chat and exploring the semi-open-world of the Zeta Halo, so be sure to swing by! If you’re stuck at work and can’t play the campaign right now, we have you covered. We got to go behind the scenes with 343 to learn a ton about multiplayer and campaign, and you can find all that excellent information in our vast cover hub!",

The rest of the teaser is logos and title cards revealing more information, such as a “first look trailer” that’ll be shown during The Game Awards 2021 tomorrow. \nGear up, Spartans. We’ll see you at @thegameawards on Thursday. #HaloTheSeries pic.twitter.com/QzWcp971Em\nDecember 7, 2021\nAs you can see in the trailer above, we get brief glimpses of some Spartans and UNSC soldiers. It looks like some are carrying Battle Rifles, Snipers, and maybe even Assault Rifles. We also spotted the iconic Pelican vehicle in the background of that first hangar bay shot and a couple of Warthogs in the third shot of actual footage. \nWhile there’s still no word on what we can genuinely expect in this Halo TV series, it’s clear the production team behind it is putting extra care into everything. However, the showrunner has revealed that the team “want[s] to do something new” with the series, so it sounds like we shouldn’t expect a retelling of the campaigns we’ve already played through in the Halo series. \nWhile waiting to see the full trailer during tomorrow’s Game Awards show, catch up on all of the teasers released so far. In November of last year, a small Master Chief helmet teaser was released, and then another teaser – the first official one – was released just last month during the Xbox 20th Anniversary Showcase.

One more thing related to Chapter 3 has now been revealed, a couple of days later: Fornite is now being developed in Unreal Engine 5. \nAnnounced on Twitter by the official Unreal Engine Twitter account, Epic Games is flipping from Unreal Engine 4 to 5 with the arrival of Chapter 3.\nWith the arrival of Chapter 3, @FortniteGame development has flipped to Unreal Engine 5.\nDecember 7, 2021\nAs for right now, this change shouldn’t mean much – what you’re playing today is Fortnite, through and through. However, through Unreal Engine 5, we might one day see a massive graphical boost in the battle royale. Plus, as Epic devs learn the upgraded engine, other substantial technical changes might come to Fortnite. \nIf Unreal Engine 5 sounds unfamiliar to you, there’s a chance you might be more familiar with last year’s stunning PlayStation 5 real-time demo that ran using the engine. You can watch it below.\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nTheoretically, Fortnite could look as great as that demo one day. Of course, Fortnite has its own art style so it likely won’t look like that demo, but it serves as a showcase for what developers can do with Unreal Engine 5 and if that’s just a taste, we’re excited to see what Epic Games does with its battle royale. \nIf you’re especially excited about that demo, you can buy a Fortnite skin for the character shown in it. We’ll all get a taste of Unreal Engine 5 tomorrow thanks to the upcoming Matrix Awakens experience that’s now available to pre-load on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, and if you don’t own one of those consoles, don’t sweat it – more information about it will be released at tomorrow’s Game Awards show.  \nAre you excited to see what becomes of Fortnite one day now that it’s being developed in Unreal Engine 5?

Unfortunately, developer Odd Tales has hit a lot of roadblocks since then, including losing its publishing partner and raising funding on its own. The Last Night has since occupied the “whatever happened to that game?” bingo card, but it appears Odd Tale is busy prepping to reintroduce the game in the foreseeable future. \nPC Gamer spoke with The Last Night’s creator, Tim Soret, via email last week regarding rumors that the game will appear during The Game Awards on December 9. Soret dismissed these rumors as just that, saying “...The Last Night will be shown next year, not before.\" He doesn’t commit to saying the game will launch in 2022, explaining that he wants to avoid putting pressure on his small team and that they’re carefully building The Last Night “brick by brick” to adapt the game’s visuals for current-gen as well as implementing a suite of accessibility options.\n\"What we know is that for The Last Night comeback in 2022, we make it our mission to blow everyone away by the strength & originality of our proposition.\" says Soret. You can watch the original debut trailer for a reminder of why people really want The Last Night to release.\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nThe Last Night was originally intended to launch in 2018, but Odd Tales split from publisher Raw Fury. Although Odd Tales regained full publishing rights to the game, the divorce seemingly triggered an avalanche of funding and legal issues the team stated it couldn’t publically speak on. Odd Tales even said it had to cancel a trailer intended for the 2018 Game Awards. The Last Night has clearly been through the wringer, but it’s refreshing to hear that it may be climbing out of development hell sooner rather than later.\nThe Last Night is slated to launch on Xbox One and PC. \n[Source: PC Gamer]",

Final Fantasy XIV is teaming up with GrubHub to offer a new “Eat Pizza” emote for those that use Grubhub’s delivery service from December 9 to December 15. And with all that time you spend waiting in queue to play, you’re sure to work up a powerful appetite! The first 20,000 orders that redeem the code ENDWALKER at checkout not only get the emote, but they also get free delivery on the order (up to $6).\nAll participants get the Eat Pizza emote on December 17th, which can then be redeemed on a Final Fantasy XIV account. You could probably get a code and give it to a friend for the holidays or something, given how this works after you order food. Even though the emote is pizza-related, you can order anything (as long as the order is over $15) for the purposes of scoring the emote code. As you may be playing Final Fantasy XIV, I’d recommend something that won’t get your controller or mouse greasy. The emote itself is sure to be the height of fashion in all those new Endwalker dungeons and raids. You can check out the full promotion details here.\nHave you been playing Endwalker?
