          "description": "\"You never know when the Pokémon inspiration will strike!\".\nIn recent years, we have seen an increasing number of roguelikes on Switch. In even more recent years, we have seen the same happen for 'Pokémon-likes'. Naturally, each genre has its respective highs and lows, but rarely have we seen both of them joined by the same game. That is, until we saw Dicefolk.\nDicefolk is a tactical roguelike. It's also a monster catcher. It's also a dice game. It's a confusing combination of genres that seem disparate on paper but click in practice. The game launched on Steam earlier this year and quickly started racking up positive reviews. So, when developers LEAP Game Studios (Tunche) and Tiny Ghoul announced that the monster-based mashup would be rolling the dice on Switch on 20th June, our interests were quickly piqued.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

This free-to-play, class-based, hero shooter was announced by FarmVille developer Zynga in 2021, but a duo of delays and its appearance in the already stacked genre of 'Overwatch-likes' hardly served as a ringing endorsement for the latest event from a galaxy far, far away.\nBut after all of that waiting, the shooter has finally arrived (as a console exclusive to Switch, no less, at least for now) and it's really rather good. Sure, those who have sampled Overwatch's class-based stylings might find nothing particularly new here, but at launch Hunters is a fast and fun take on the PvP formula that might even serve as a fitting trial for any Padawans of the genre.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Run art-stealing generation tools faster! Oh, Computex, what have they done to you, and why do you have seven fingers on one hand?\nGranted, AI is a broad field, and not everything about it is necessarily gross or creatively bankrupting.

          "description": "Hollywood Animal is a management sim about turning a bankrupt movie studio into a money printing machine, set in Hollywood’s golden age. While a Frostpunk 2 or Manor Lords might have you grapple with the elements, here it’s all about balancing a fickle audience and Tinseltown’s seedy underbelly. Maybe making some worthwhile art, too? Sorry, did I say ‘worthwhile art’? I meant to say “lots of money.” Let’s get clicking!\nFirst up, I need to name my studio (I settle on Horace's Revenge) as well as my crack new team of business bastards. There’s my chief legal officer, Jebediah End. My CCO, Anne Egg, and CFO, Rummy McLastdrink. He doesn’t have a sauce problem, because obviously I wouldn’t put him in charge of money if he did. In the wreckage of the studio, we find an unedited film reel hidden in the waffles n’ cocaine cupboard. It’s a noir thriller named ‘Messenger Of Death’. Whatever influential critic is currently directing this era’s discourse has chosen to categorise each film as genre percentages (‘60% detective/40% thriller’), and setting (‘modern American city’.) Let’s just hope those pigs in the stands recognise a solid gold picture when they see one!\n \nRead more",

Right, onwards.\nLife In Jars is this YouTuber I've followed for a while. He makes videos that might involve, say, scooping up some puddle water, leaving it in a sealed jar for a while, then coming back to it a few months later. He'll report on the results, which are often tremendous. Look at the LIFE in that jar! The little wriggly lads just wriggling around. The blobs whose job is to float and squidge indiscriminately. A lovely bit of fauna sloshing about there, like a forest dwelling for those who implement the five-second rule. It's a reminder that bog water is rather beautiful, actually.\nHaving spent three hours with Elden Ring expansion Shadow Of The Erdtree's opening area, I can't help but think of Life In Jars. What resides in the shadowy dome of the Big Tree is horrendous! Miserable! The forgotten creatures and their crumbling homes are grim. But oh my word, the shadows have spawned a beautiful disasterpiece. Just, errr, those other jars? The fun guys with the scoopy arms and little legs? Yeah. I have bad news.\nRead more",

Please feel free to try any of these on for size: Grunn’s shear sound is the Wilhelm Scream of gardening equipment, sure to be referenced for decades to come. Grunn’s shear sound wormed its way past my eyes and into parts of my brain I’d previously assumed could only be accessed by either masterful ASMR or irresponsibly long Q-tips. I used to have anxiety, but now, my only fear in life is that Grunn’s grass will run out, so I no longer have a reason to click away with its shears. Play Grunn, innit. There are, by the way, lots of other things to like about it, although I cannot hear them over the wonderful sound of these shears.\n \nRead more",

It became a magnet for competitive drivers after a prize pool of over $30,000 was offered to the first three players to conquer its hellish heights. The prize has yet to be claimed. Even today, determined racers continue to bang their heads against the brutally designed course, featuring icy surfaces, curving rails, and perilous loop-the-loops that hang kilometres about the ground.

Here, the enemy troops are naughty Reptoid aliens, the writing is scattershot-satirical (upgrades are bought with pizza tokens) and your helicopter houses the soul of a blood-drinking \"AZ-TECH\" goddess.

It's operated by three people: one person drives the tank with a steering wheel and levers, another uses cranks to aim the gun barrel, and a third reloads the shells that eject automatically from the chamber after every desk-lifting blast. The \"shells\" in question are 2-litre bottles of fizzy drink, and the crew has set up a whole rack of these bottles for panicked reloading.

That’s basically the high-level concept for brilliant sci-fi comedy show Severance, right there. Not wanting to spoil any more than I absolutely have to, I’ll present you with two facts up top. 1. It features a touching queer relationship between John Turturro and Christopher Walken and 2. It’s some of the best television I’ve seen in the last few years.

The bad, silly, clearly pointless news is that it will need a PlayStation Network (PSN) account, despite the complete lack of multiplayer.\nRead more",

Cadaverous, perhaps) Age of survival horror on PS1, but it's rare you play one that invokes the N64, and even less often that you stumble on something horror-adjacent that riffs on Star Fox 64. Ah, Star Fox! The natural companion piece for, say, Eternal Darkness or The Suffering. In fairness, I did always find those Pez dispenser dialogue animations pretty eerie.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "To kick off with some extremely half-arsed mytho-geometry, the original Frostpunk was a testament to both the design utility and the inexhaustible political symbolism of circles. When people wish to found a community of equals they commonly form a circle, with each participant visible and audible to the rest. A circle is also the best shape for defending against an engulfing ambient threat such as a global ice age, because it has no weak points, and it makes a great centrepiece for a videogame interface, a symmetrical motif that can be tuned and adorned to either suck your attention into the screen or distribute it evenly in all directions.\nCreated by Polish developers 11 bit, Frostpunk takes place in the middle of a circle, an Arctic crater with a huge coal generator at its heart. Your city rises in rings around that generator, each additional layer of dwellings corresponding intuitively to decreasing temperature, and the result is one of the most focused and thematically consistent specimens of its genre - a building game that feels as intimate and urgent as tending a campfire. Frostpunk 2's new campaign mode breaks the circle open. It starts where you (hopefully) ended, with the crater now fully colonised and evolved into a glaring, blue-orange geode of high-density housing and clustered chimneys. But the view has been pulled back, and construction now unfolds along the plains and canyons beyond the crater, which consist not of circles but of hexagons - another UI designer's favourite - on which you'll plot out upgradeable districts rather than assembling individual buildings. \r\n \nRead more",

You’ll quickly realise this a school-with-no-trousers-esque dream sequence, but the matted mess of thick black cables that carpet this dingy side-stage is painfully accurate. Pissing around with gear is roughly 70% of the band experience, in my limited experience of being in bands. This probably changes when you’ve got roadies or dedicated tech people, but we did not, because we were skint. And also terrible. Several hours of Deathbulge has brought me more joy than several years of being in actual bands. I had some isolated good times in some of those bands, but I’m having a very good time with Deathbulge.\n \nRead more",

Anyway, the latest game to put a hinge-disrespecting protagonist front and center is also my current obsession: the excellent Post Void/Hotline Miami-type beat, Mullet Mad Jack. It’s a very fast, very silly FPS about shooting robot billionaires that takes its aesthetic from 80’s anime and PC-98 games. I’m not sure what else you need, honestly.\n \nRead more",

Innocent times and places like the prologue for Baldur's Gate, which unfolds in the vast, fortified monastery of Candlekeep (beware spoilers from this point on).\nBioWare's first ever RPG opens with your unsuspecting Chosen One learning the ropes from the old sage Gorion. There are fetchquests that take you around the enormous citadel, bits of combat training to do, cosy formative chinwags to have with characters like your childhood friend Imoen. But it's not to last, of course: Gorion is murdered, and you must rove the Sword Coast in pursuit of his killer. When you return to Candlekeep later in the game, this once-proud bastion of learning has been filled with doppelgangers of Gorion and other acquaintances, a parade of chatbots waiting to stab you in the back.\r\n \nRead more",

The kind that probably has twelve artists dedicated to the recreation of visible pores, that sort of thing. It’s so focused on looking pretty that it hasn’t even noticed the title and subtitle got mixed up.\nSure enough, Hellblade 2 is a harsh test for older hardware, with a heavy reliance on DLSS or FSR upscaling to keep performance sweet. That said, it’s no Dragons Dogma 2-style technical horrorshow either. A happy balance of visuals and smoothness is attainable on plush PCs and low-end laptops alike, while DLSS 3 frame generation can deliver an effective kick in the framerate pants on RTX 40 series GPUs.\nRead more",

The simple yet strategic gameplay and wacky medieval theme, along with the opportunity to curse your friends and family, has won over many. However, I’d argue that what truly makes the game great is its extensive catalogue of expansions. \n\n\nDominion: Rising Sun, the 16th expansion for the game, is due to drop in June 2024. In addition, many of the game’s earlier expansions have been updated in recent years with second edition printings.

          "description": "Rockstar has officially announced the GTA Online Summer update, and the patch's headline addition will be a new business that lets you become a true bounty hunter and arrest criminals across San Andreas for cash. \n\n\nIf you've played GTA V in the decade since its release, it's very likely that you've been the one causing mayhem and committing crimes on the streets of Los Santos. If you fancy going clean, however, Rockstar will let you become the hunter rather than be the hunted with this summer's major update. \n\n\nIn a blog post on the Rockstar website, the developer quoted Sandy Shores resident Maude Eccles, claiming that \"this world is full of scum and detritus,\" and that's time that \"we all bear our share.\"\n\n\nYou're doing their job! Image via Rockstar\n\n\n\"This summer, it's time for some (high-value) target practice to clean up the roving reprobates of Southern San Andreas,\" the blog reads, confirming that \"your very own bail enforcement and bounty hunting business\" is coming in the game's next major update. \n\n\nHow it will work exactly remains unclear, but I would guess that there will be a bounty board in your business that tells you who needs to be apprehended. We'll hear more about the bail enforcement business in the coming weeks as we build up to the Summer update.\n\n\nAlso included in the Summer update is a new Vincent mission that ties in with the new bail work, new tools to make custom Drift and Drag Raves, new vehicles, and boost payouts for Taxi Work, Open Wheel Races, and Operation Paper Trail missions. \n\n\nThe GTA Online Summer patch doesn't have a release date just yet, but with GTA 6 now firmly on the horizon, some wonder if it'll be the last major update for the game. I expect to see a Christmas patch personally, but it wouldn't surprise me if this was the last Summer update we get. \n\nThe post GTA Online’s Summer update will let you become a real bounty hunter appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Final Shape, the latest Destiny 2 expansion, just made its debut, and we all know what that means. Beyond the new campaign, raid, and exotics, the game's opening days for major updates often mean error code after error code as you try to play. \n\n\nOn the bright side, Bungie does at least get funny with it, using names like Weasel or Chicken to denote player problems. One such error has plagued a handful of people and can be quite irritating. Here's how to fix error code Cacao in Destiny 2.\n\n\nWhat does error code Cacao in Destiny 2: The Final Shape mean?\n\n\nLike a lot of the error codes recently with Destiny 2, this error code refers to a networking error between you and the servers. \n\n\nWhile this could be a fault on your end, the launch of The Final Shape means it's more likely to be serverside. Like other error codes, such as Currant, your best bet is to keep trying or wait until the servers have cleared up before attempting to play.\n\n\nHow to fix Destiny 2 error codes, like Cacao\n\n\nIf it is something on your end, or you simply want to try for a sanity check, you can do a few things. Firstly, restarting whatever device you're playing on may fix the issue, as would restarting your router. \n\n\nIf that fails, you could try improving the connection by either moving your device closer to the router or switching from a wireless to a wired connection. One good way to know if your connection is fine is to test it in another game and see if issues are persistent. If everything's clear, it's likely an issue on Bungie's side that needs time.\n\nThe post How to fix Destiny 2 error code Cacao appeared first on Destructoid.",

Plus, Square Enix has released the first Octopath Traveler on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4, meaning both mainline Octopath Traveler games are now playable on all console platforms. \nIf you're on Xbox, Octopath Traveler II is also available on Xbox and PC Game Pass alongside the first game. If you've been waiting to jump into this series – whether on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, or PC – now is the best time. And both games are great; read why in Game Informer's Octopath Traveler review and Game Informer's Octopath Traveler II review. \n\n\nTo celebrate the series being available on all current platforms and PC (via Steam and Windows), developer Team Asano has released a free update to Octopath Traveler II that includes an \"Extra Battle\" mode that becomes available after defeating the game's final boss. In this mode, players can test their skills against newly added extra-tough opponents – including the main characters from the first game. This mode has been available on Xbox consoles since launch but is now available on PlayStation, Switch, and PC. \n\"Since its launch in 2018 with Octopath Traveler, the Octopath Traveler series has sold over four million copies worldwide, popularizing the unique HD-2D art style: a striking blend of 2D character designs in beautiful 3D worlds,\" a press release reads. \"Both games are a standalone experience set in different worlds with eight distinct protagonists, each with their own stories to explore and Path Actions to use. Players will embark on a grand adventure and steer their own journey, depending on whom they choose to play as.\" \nAre you going to check out the series on a new platform?

          "description": "The Last of Us Season 2 is on the way but it won’t be last for the series, nor will it cover the entirety of the sequel it's adapting. A new interview with Deadline reveals the season’s 7-episode count, the likelihood of a third and even fourth season, and how the showrunners plan on telling its story.\nThe Last of Us Part II is a long game. So much so that showrunners and directors Craig Mazin and Naughty Dog president Neil Druckmann realized it would need to tell its story across more than one season. \n“The story material that we got from Part II of the game is way more than the story material that was in the first game, so part of what we had to do from the start was figure out how to tell that story across seasons,” Mazin said. “When you do that, you look for natural breakpoints, and as we laid it out, this season, the natural breakpoint felt like it came after seven episodes.”\nEven though Season 2 will be shorter than Season 1, one of its episodes is said to be \"quite big\" in length. The showrunners also tease that a potential Season 3 will be much larger in scope. Despite this, Mazin doesn’t believe they can tell the whole story in two seasons because they want to take their time. “And indeed, the story may require Season 4,” he says.\nHBO has not yet renewed The Last of Us for a third or fourth season, but Mazin believes it will happen, “as long as people keep watching.” \nFor those worried that Season 2 would rush through Part II's events, it seems you can relax. We'll see where the story stops when The Last of Us Season 2 kicks off in 2025. To get a look at what the season has in store, you can take your first looks at Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey’s Joel and Ellie, and read about the castings for Dina, along with Manny, Mel, Owen, and Nora. Actor Jeffrey Wright was recently cast to reprise his role as Isaac.\n[Source: Deadline]",

The game was first announced during the online-only E3 2021 and has suffered a few delays since then with minimal updates. After a long wait, the game has finally reemerged with a new trailer and a fall 2024 launch window.\nThe new video shows off the game's spin on tactics, with long-time stars Marco, Eri, Fio, and Tarma taking literal turns obliterating the opposition. The game sees players building squads of classic Metal Slug characters, each with unique loadouts of recognizable series weapons, to take on signature villains and bosses, like the warship in the video.\n\n\nMetal Slug Tactics is developed by Leikir Studio and is published by Dotemu, the team behind TMNT: Shredder's Revenge. Famed composer Tee Lopes (Shredder's Revenge, Sonic Mania) is developing the game's soundtrack. \nWhen first revealed, Metal Slug Tactics was only slated to launch for Switch and PC.

The 2021 action-adventure game has been available only on PlayStation and PC, and its move to Microsoft’s platform comes with some new in-game goodies.\nAs the debut title by Ember Lab, this story-driven action game stars Kena, a young spirit guide who must unravel the mystery of a destroyed village by helping lost souls move on to the afterlife. She’s assisted by the Rot, tiny, adorable spirits Kena can command to aid in puzzle-solving and combat. The game’s design draws inspiration from series such as The Legend of Zelda, while combat has shades of From Software’s Dark Souls. \nKena hits Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One on August 15 for $39.99 and will include exclusive pirate-themed Rot hats, a Golden Rot skin, and a unique staff for Kena. A new physical premium edition will also be available and will consist of these items, a digital soundtrack, and an exclusive sticker sheet. The Xbox version also includes the Anniversary DLC update, which includes the Spirit Guide Trials, additional Kena outfits, and New Game+\n\n\nWe awarded Kena: Bridge of Spirits a 9 out of 10, with former editor-in-chief Andrew Reiner writing in his review, \"Bridge of Spirits stumbles a little in spots, yet confidently sprints into the heart of the adventure, rewarding the player with secrets galore and visuals that are almost always worth admiring.

The open-world game is the latest entry in the Nikki series of fashion games, which is very popular in Asia, and Westerners are getting their biggest exposure to it yet with this charming adventure. \n\n\nThe game unfolds on the magical continent of Miraland, and Nikki must save it. Her main power is \"styling,\" which involves changing clothes from different nations, allowing her to adopt unique abilities. For example, one outfit allows her to float while another cleanses corrupted creatures of demonic energy. The trailer shows one outfit that lets players summon a giant flower to glide through the air. Another ability shrinks her to the size of her small companion, Momo, to access tight areas and other locations. \nThe more outfits you collect, the more abilities Nikki has to solve puzzles and overcome platforming obstacles. But despite the \"save the world\" premise, Infinity Nikki is billed as a relaxing adventure. You can also catch bugs, go fishing, and gather resources to craft new outfits, among other activities. \nInfinity Nikki looks wild, and fans can get their first taste of it in a beta test happening during Q3 of this year.

          "description": "Developer Survios has released the first look at gameplay in its upcoming VR game, Alien: Rogue Incursion, and it turns out, exploring a seemingly abandoned  facility in VR looks as terrifying as you'd expect.\nThe trailer aired during today's PlayStation State of Play as the game is coming to PS VR2, but it's also coming to Meta Quest 3 and Steam (for other PC VR devices) this holiday season. In the trailer, we get a few glimpses of some Xenomorphs, the tracking device we'll be using to avoid said Xenomorphs, and a look at some pods that indicate we might be fighting more than one. \nCheck it out for yourself in the Alien: Rogue Incursion gameplay trailer below: \n\n\nIn a new PlayStation Blog post, Survios chief product officer TQ Jefferson explains that Alien: Rogue Incursion was developed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. Jefferson also shares that the \"high tension shooter\" tasks players with exploring an \"overrun facility on the inhospitable planet Purdan.\" \n\"Dynamically spawning and pathing with countless unique possibilities, even we couldn't tell you exactly where and when each Xenomorph will strike, let alone what strategies it might use or if it'll bring some friends,\" the blog post reads. \"While heart-pounding combat is the core of Alien: Rogue Incursion, grabbing your pulse rifle and blasting your way out of every situation is not always the best strategy. \n\"Constantly hunted by unpredictable and resourceful Xenomorphs, players will often find creativity and a level head to be their greatest weapons, especially when it comes to leveraging the environment to their advantage.\" \nAlien: Rogue Incursion hits VR this holiday season. \nAre you going to check out Alien: Rogue Incursion later this year? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "Until Dawn, the 2015 horror adventure game from Supermassive Games, is coming to PlayStation 5 and PC in remake form this fall. We received a new trailer for the beloved game alongside the announcement during today's State of Play presentation. \nUntil Dawn puts you in control of eight teenagers/young adults who venture up a mountain for a fun night in a secluded cabin. In typical slasher-movie fashion, there is much more than meets the eye regarding this cabin and its surrounding area. Relying heavily on player choice, Until Dawn's narrative uses a system called the Butterfly Effect, where pivotal choices you make have consequences that go far beyond that which you can immediately recognize. The game stars actors like Rami Malek, Hayden Panettiere, Meaghan Martin, and more.\n\n\nOriginally announced as a full remake of the game, the trailer footage does not appear to be a significant step up in terms of visuals, appearing to be more in line with the industry's definition of a remaster. PlayStation's official description says it's been \"rebuilt and enhanced for PS5 consoles and PC.\" Developed by Ballistic Moon, this improved version also boasts new environments, collectibles, and re-cut narrative sequences. \nWe loved Until Dawn when it arrived on PlayStation 4 in 2015, awarding it a score of 9 out of 10. In the time since Until Dawn's original release, Supermassive has released other games in the genre, including The Dark Pictures Anthology and The Quarry. The studio is currently working on The Casting of Frank Stone, a game set in the Dead by Daylight universe. Until Dawn arrives on PlayStation 5 and PC this fall.",

Unlike the last entry, Astro's Playroom, which was a PS5 launch title and a glorified (but very fun) tech demo for the console, this new game is a full-fledged platforming adventure. It's also got an easy-to-remember name: Astro Bot. \nThe trailer sees Astro Bot soaring through the galaxy on a Dual Sense-shaped spaceship to explore a variety of vibrant platforming stages set to a smile-inducing soundtrack. He also shows off new abilities like donning gloves that fire springs to grab and swing enemies, soaking water like a sponge to grow gigantic, and, best of all, just a random Parappa the Rappa reference (among other PlayStation franchises). It looks delightful, and we want to play it. \n\n\nA PlayStation Blog post also states the game features over 80 levels across 6 galaxies, 20 new abilities, and 70 new enemy types. Astro Bot will be available on PlayStation 5 on September 6.

Concord is both the start of a new sci-fi IP for PlayStation and a five-versus-five-player multiplayer shooter coming to PlayStation 5 and PC this year. \nBefore showcasing some third-person shooter gameplay, a vignette setting up the game's world and tone played, and it's here we get a look at its Guardians of the Galaxy-esque action. We see several characters who appear to make up the rag-tag group of heroes we'll be controlling, each with seemingly unique abilities, attempting to capture a special device from someone attempting to escape a rundown locale called Crater City. \nCheck it out for yourself in the Concord cinematic reveal below: \n\n\nAfter this vignette, PlayStation showcased our first look at Concord's gameplay. We get a look at Vale, a sniper, Lennox, a cowboy-esque revolver shooter, Haymar, who uses a magical bow and arrow, Star Child, a brutish shotgun user, and 1-Off, a support character who appears to use support-type elemental moves. The gameplay looks reminiscent of Destiny 2's PvP modes, although brighter in color and more fantastical in visual design. \nCheck out the Concord gameplay reveal for yourself below:\n\n\nAfter the gameplay, some of the Firewalk developers spoke about what players can expect, including deployable gear that can exist throughout a full game (across multiple rounds) and asymmetrical match-ups between players. While the gameplay only showcased five characters, a quick look at the game's roster revealed several more. \nFirewalk says every week when you log on to Concord, you'll be treated to a short cutscene vignette teaching you more about the characters. \nFirewalk and PlayStation will hold a beta on PS5 and PC this July before the game's simultaneous launch on those platforms on August 23, 2024. \nWhat did you think of this Concord reveal?

          "description": "The PlayStation 5 generation is already Sony's most profitable yet, the company has announced. In terms of numbers, the PS5 generation has already earned Sony $106 billion, according to a slide from its \"Game & Network Services Segment\" presentation from PlayStation's two new CEOs, Hideaki Nishino and Hermen Hulst. \nHowever, on that same slide, Sony shows that the PlayStation 4 generation earned $107 billion, which is obviously more than $106 billion. But, the reason Sony is calling the PS5 generation the most profitable one yet is because the PS4 generation is largely complete whereas the PS5 presumably still has years to go. Given it's made $106 billion in roughly four years, it seems Sony is confident it will surpass $107 billion in the coming months or years. \nAs for what Sony is including in its profits, it's the entire gamut of the PS5 generation. This includes the PS5 console itself, associated hardware and accessories, and software, too. It also includes services, like PlayStation Plus, according to the presentation. \nOne of the reasons the PS5 generation might be Sony's most profitable yet is because even though the playerbase is as big as the PS4 – both are sitting at 49 million active consoles as of last month – PS5 players are playing significantly more on their console. The PS5 generation sits at 2.4 billion total gameplay hours while the PS4 sits at 1.4 billon. More playtime likely equates to more spending, which might be one of the reasons the PS5 generation is doing financially as well as it is. \nLife-to-date spending on the PS5 is also higher amongst players than the PS4, too. Across peripherals, services, content/add-ons, and content/full games, the PS4 life-to-date spend is $580 while PS5 players average $731. \nFor more, read about how the PS5 recently broke a sales record for Sony, and then check out Game Informer's list of the top 10 PS5 games. \nWhat are your thoughts on the PlayStation 5 generation so far? Let us know in the comments below!",

The news comes as part of a celebration of Minecraft’s 15th anniversary.\nWildBrain, the studio behind other Netflix shows such as Sonic Prime, Ninjago: Dragons Rising, and Carmen Sandiego, is developing this CG-animated Minecraft show. Plot details are nonexistent, but a press release states the series will be \"showing the world of Minecraft in a new light\" and feature an original story with new characters.\n\n\nThis won't be the only on-screen adaptation of the best-selling video game of all time. A live-action Minecraft movie is currently in production, with Jack Black confirmed to star as Steve.  \nThe Minecraft show, whatever it winds up being titled, has no premiere date. In the meantime, be sure to catch up on the other video game adaptations Netflix has on the way, including the first teaser for Season 4 of The Witcher (now starring Liam Hemsworth), the first trailer for Arcane Season 2, and the first look at the animated Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft starring Hayley Atwell.",

The less-than-heroic superhero becomes available for Kombat Pack owners on June 4 and for everyone else on June 11.\nThe patriotic and maniacal leader of The Seven shows no quarter to his new MK adversaries, obliterating them with an offensive style that is very reminiscent of Superman’s playstyle in the Injustice series. The trailer also shows off the new DLC Kameo fighter Ferra, the smaller, more feral half of the Ferra & Torr team from Mortal Kombat X, who also joins the game sometime in June. \n\n\nHomelander joins Peacemaker, Invincible’s Omni-Man, Ermac, Quan-Chi, and the upcoming Takeda in the Year 1 DLC roster.

          "description": "Hive Jump 2: Survivors arrives in Steam Early Access today. To celebrate, publisher Midwest Games and developer Graphite Lab have shared an exclusive trailer for the Survivors-like sequel. The first Hive Jump caught our eye way back in 2015 when we named it one of the most promising indie titles on display at PAX West that year before its launch in 2017. The original Hive Jump served as a four-player co-op homage to Super Metroid, but Hive Jump 2: Survivors takes inspiration from a different title: Vampire Survivors.\nThe genre, called \"bullet heaven,\" puts players in the shoes of a single character who eventually builds up to become extremely powerful as the waves of enemies grow more intense. Hive Jump 2: Survivors carries forward the look of its Metroidvania predecessor but from the genre-standard top-down perspective. You take control of a lone survivor of an alien attack who must now face seemingly insurmountable odds to survive. You can customize your loadout and upgrade your jetpack to destroy enemies and escape tough situations.\nThe jetpack also allows you to traverse the levels in ways not available in Vampire Survivors. The Jumpers have specific builds that allow you to cater to your play style, which combines with the upgrades you select before each run. You can play with auto-assist aiming or switch to manual controls. If you can survive 14 rounds, you can challenge big boss battles. As you collect goo from fallen enemies, you can earn better weapons, upgrades, and relics to improve your odds. Meanwhile, amber you find in the field can be traded for permanent upgrades to stats, magnets for auto-scavenging, or even screen-wiping nukes.\nYou can see an exclusive look at the Early Access launch trailer below.\n\n\nHive Jump 2: Survivors launches into Steam Early Access today. For more on the work produced by Graphite Lab, check out our review of their 2023 2D platformer, Mr. Run and Jump, here.",
