          "description": "A quick link to the past.\nWe almost set ourselves the challenge of writing this review without mentioning Link's Awakening. But as sure as a retro-styled 2D RPG includes hackable bushes, Castaway had so many similarities to the Nintendo classic that it would have been impossible. Despite our preference for a fresher take on the formula like the recent Kudzu, in fairness, Canari Games (Lunark) makes no attempt to conceal Castaway's inspiration. The surprising fact is that — even with all the similarities: the pushing puzzles, the hookshot, the waking up on the beach, the identical audio cues, and the almost cloned enemies (down to their very animations) — Castaway reminded us of other SNES and Game Boy games even more.\nCastaway is a very short game. It took us around 30 minutes to beat the three bosses that represent the main threats on 'The Island', the story mode, and to rescue our cute little dog that was kidnapped during the opening cutscene. We spent about an hour on the secondary mode, ‘The Tower’, where we battled our way through 50 floors of increasing difficulty. Addiction took hold a little as we rolled here and there, picking up gold coins from fallen enemies and unlocking new powers – shields, sword buffs, even a protective orb circling the character like in a side-scrolling shooter. We appreciated that this mode was a crafted experience, with no sign of randomly generated levels.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

During the briefest of cutscenes we’re re-introduced to series main man Therion on a gothic-styled spaceship hurtling through the stars. Hekate, his AI companion, says she’s picked up the signal of his father, Vroll, the man responsible for the destruction of Therion’s home planet Valfaris, and someone Therion would very much like to kill. Therion turns and, with a strut, heads off to battle. We found it all delightfully brief.\nWhile the previous game (the idiosyncratic Valfaris) was a hectic Contra-style run-and-gun experience, this sequel has morphed the series into a side-scrolling shooter – R-Type by way of Pacific Rim. The setting is a post-apocalyptic sci-fi hellscape where colour palettes have been maxed out to their highest saturation and contrast, and a pleasingly epic death metal soundtrack accompanies every moment.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Not only is this a return to the roots after the divisive New Gundam Breaker didn’t go over so well with the fanbase, but this marks the first time that the mainline series has come to either the Nintendo Switch or Western audiences. Luckily, Gundam Breaker 4 makes a great first impression—its combat is addictive, the customisation options are second to none, and there’s enough content here to keep you busy for quite a while. If you’ve been looking for a solid new hack ‘n’ slash action game to add to your Switch library, this just may be for you.\nGundam Breaker 4 features a simple story, placing you in the role of a self-insert protagonist who is playing an in-universe version of Gundam Breaker 4. You start out by making a few friends in your ‘online’ sessions who you soon form a clan with, then slowly start building your experience and prestige in the community as you overcome rivals and work up to participate in the big Battle Tournament at the end of the season.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "In the first post for my series on \"saving\" open world design, I complained that many of today's open worlds feel like checklists of formulaic tasks and rewards, their geography a vaporous staging ground for itemisable, cycling content-gathering opportunities, which flies in the face of the sense of freedom and wonder they're supposed to inspire. My interviewees, Elder Scrolls veterans Matt Firor and Nate Purkeypile, argued that this reflects the expense and scale of today's open world productions, which constrains experimental design both at a practical level and in terms of overall direction.\nCD Projekt open world designer Jakub Tomczak doesn't, as far as I know, have an answer to the issue of production bloat, but he does have a disarmingly obvious solution to the 'checklist problem', based on his time creating missions for Cyberpunk 2077 and its Phantom Liberty expansion: get better at hiding the checklist. Weave it into the landscape and setting more artfully, with an elegant balance of randomisation and responsiveness to the player's behaviour which keeps everything fresh. \r\n\n \nRead more",

It was a copy of The Game of Life, possibly the least exciting board game a child can win.\nThe game was dog water, and there’s probably a lesson in there somewhere about how cool and good it is to whine until you get free things, but we don’t have time for that. Instead, I’d like to draw your attention to Floops Big House Adventure. It’s a grungy, slimy, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters meets Ren and Stimpy Saturday morning shooter.

It blew the dust from my synapses.\nThe same appears true of King-Spooner's upcoming Judero, on which he is collaborating with Soul Searching developer Talha Kaya. It casts you as a \"pagan seer\" armed with a big stick, who is searching the mythical Scottish borderlands for evil creatures to clobber. It looks cheerier and airier than Sluggish Morss, with a more overt emphasis on mechanics such as combat, but it has the same pickled 3am energy to it.

Until the next time I have to write about Andrew Wilson.\n“Oil just use my trusty knoife” mutters Sid as I take down my first guard. Straight away, the animation and noise indicators evoke the same Shadow Tactics or Desperados III goodness you’re probably expecting. Fine with me - that’s exactly what I’m here for.

          "description": "Stormgate is a confusing proposition. It's an RTS directed by former Blizzard developers that is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike StarCraft. It's a free-to-play game, but has a business model that makes you feel like you're getting a rougher deal than if you just dropped thirty notes for it outright. It's available now in Early Access, but has already been available in a kind of gravity-defying Super Early Access for several weeks (which you had to pay to get into).\r\n\n\r\nAll of which has made me feel very tired, and yearn for the days when you went into a shop and bought a game in a box for a set amount of money, and the whole game was in the box and you went home and put it on your PC and played it until your mum said \"Richard!\" (only my mum calls me Richard) \"get off that computer and go outside and get some exercise! Do you want to be dead at 35?\" Well, I'm 36 now mum. Nearly 37. So who's laughing through their heart palpitations now?\r\n\n \nRead more",

While it would be a monumentally silly heel turn to go back on their promise of only charging Space Marine 2 players extra for cosmetics a mere week and change before the shooter’s September 9 release date,  the new year one roadmap does at least look piously forthright.\nChatting to James at Gamescom recently (possibly from his cathedral ship made out of graphics cards), Saber boss Tim Willits dragged out an armoured horse and proceeded to flog it mercilessly, saying that players don’t want to be sold the equivalent of Oblivion's infamous deadbeat daddy of DLCs. As several of you identified, this seemed like an odd comparison when Spice Maureen 2 specifically plans to charge for comparable cosmetics, although I imagine Willits was referencing the “packs” that his space game’s baubles come in. “Our fans never thought we ripped them off in World War Z,” he said, comparing Space Marine 2’s optional spendables to that game.\nWhether you see the cosmetic's pricing as egregious or not, yesterday’s roadmap does look to make good on Saber’s promise to keep wearables and playables separate.

He's there, barely camouflaged, in the undergrowth of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - a remake of the fifth Metal Gear game, originally released in 2004, which tells the tale of a lone US special operator hunting superweapons and old mentors in the jungles of the southern Soviet Union. \r\n\n\r\nI say \"remake\" but this feels more like a re-release, in spirit. True, it now runs on Unreal Engine, with the option of a manual, third-person perspective and cover-shooter controls in addition to the old top-down viewpoints. Yes, it boasts new flourishes, such as wounds now leaving scars, and clothes picking up stray leaves. Yes, there's a new interface with floating in-world menus, which makes shuffling between the layers a bit less awkward. It's the product of much labour, with development split between Konami and external support partner Virtuos. But where Konami's other big restoration project, Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake, is a creative dialogue with the original game, Delta seems consumed by faithfulness to Kojima's original design.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's also a free-to-play game, and I have the usual unanswered questions about currencies and gacha, but I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt for the minute, because I have not spent nearly enough of my life considering the tactical applications of ballgowns.

(It came out in 1997, and as such, I think the statute of limitations on spoilers has passed, but if you still intend to play, stop reading now.) The mission completes the long arc of foreshadowing begun by the intro's mention that capital-class spacecraft have been outlawed, following a ruinous war. It turns out that one particular evil corpo has been sneakily building one of these megaships - not only that, but you get to fly inside it, cannons ablazing. It was while doing so that teenage me realised the true exceptionality of the Video Game Artform. You can't fly inside capital ships in, like, symbolist poems or baroque symphonies, can you? You can't fly in poems or symphonies at all, unless you do so metaphorically - \"metaphor\" being a kind of poor man's graphics card.\nThe technology of flight simming has advanced mightily since G-Police's day. For instance: in Everspace 2's just-announced Titans DLC, you get to fly inside not just regular old spaceships, but massive space kaiju with procedurally generated digestive systems.

You can, quite literally, go on tours curated by historians around each of the game's respective maps. Instead of diving off a Sphinx and plunging your hidden blade into someone's spinal column, you can look up at the Sphinx and read a paragraph on its significance. Maybe view an actual, real life bit of ancient Egypt from an actual real life museum collection in-game. Perhaps embody an Anglo-Saxon lad in Valhalla, instead, and like, cook up some nettle soup having just got a fresh \"Friar Tuck\" at the local hair choppers (no guarantees on this last bit).\nThis is all to say that Black Myth: Wukong deserves such a mode, too. There were so many times throughout my review time where I stopped and stared and wondered as to something's meaning. Not only in the architecture, but in the characters, too. So here I am with a proposition: how about instead of thwacking things with my staff, I can use it as a walking stick and point it at things I want to learn about.\nRead more",

Developers Striking Distance and publishers Krafton have revealed [REDACTED], a scifi roguelike dungeon crawler set in the same universe.\nThe square brackets are part of the title, yes, and they're also calling it \"punk rock\" - a combination of factors that fills me with a rage so obliterating, I can barely perceive the announcement trailer, below. It's a machinegun montage of comicbook panels and sizzling melee arcs and quips like \"there's a lot of wankers between you and the sweet taste of freedom\". I didn't even like The Callisto Protocol that much but still, what have they done to you, boy? Where did all the horror game go?\n Read more",

Yes, with SteamWorld Heist 2, they're revisiting the sci-fi bullet-bouncing of their 2016 tactics game SteamWorld Heist, but they're also introducing significant changes to create a compulsive XCOM-like full of sea-faring submariners that may be their best work yet, even against a back catalogue of blinders. \nRead more",

Mind you, I tend to play games with my nose about 10 centimetres from the screen.

Forthcoming RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard will support 21:9 ultrawide monitors.

Now don't be silly, that's spring. Not April, surely. This beast seems hungry. It will eat before then. I have foreseen it. Mostly by watching the trailer that dropped at Gamescom.\nRead more",

So much so, in fact, that I’d assumed the trailer I watched during an online preview event last week was for a new entry in the horror cinematic-platformer series, right up until the name Reanimal appeared on the screen - shortly followed by a snippet of voiced dialogue.\nIt’s not just the horror setting, but the Grimm’s fairytale threat, the distorted adults-made-monsters through the trauma-tinged lens of a child’s imagination. A long-limbed man riding a bicycle in a threadbare suit chases children down an alley. A gangly, bowler-hatted pursuer scuttles down a long table like a spider. It's familiar enough territory, at least at first glance. But when Tarsier have a body of work subconsciously scarred by phantasms this vivid, recurring nightmares are just as potent.\nRead more",

Reviewer Edders went so far as to find the world more engaging than that of Elden Ring - proper defying-the-gods level rhetoric. Players seem to agree. The game launched last night, and has already accrued a concurrent player peak of 1.44 million - Steam's fourth highest ever, exceeded only by Counter-Strike, Palworld and PUBG. By that metric, it's the platform's most popular strictly single player game of all the time.\nAll that goodwill has been spoiled, however, by a Steam code handout message to streamers and other \"content creators\" before launch which includes some reactionary, non-binding requests - no mention of \"trigger words\" like \"Covid-19\", no talk of \"politics\" or \"feminist propaganda\", and no mention of \"China's game industry policies, opinions, news, etc\". \n Read more",

It’s permissive and demanding; playful and tense. Its globe-spanning plot covers conspiracies, PMCs, and brutal theocratic dictatorships. It also features a traffic-summoning warlock named Steve wearing a hi-vis robe. It’s finding that one absolutely, perfectly ridiculous XCOM turn, every turn…and at the same time knowing it’s absolutely, perfectly fine if you don’t. In short: it’s one of the most enjoyable tactics games I’ve ever played, and the only tactics game with a pyromancer so rubbish he relies on making his enemies pass out from heatstroke.\nRead more",

They've also shared a little about why it's taken so long to arrive - the (generally decent) action-RPG hit PS5 over a year ago, back when I was still some filthy console-playing freelancer.\nAccording to director Hiroshi Takai, it was \"impossible\" to create the PC and PS5 versions at the same time, even if Square Enix hadn't been restrained by a timed exclusivity clause. He also thinks that the Final Fantasy series faces no \"existential risk\" right now, despite lower-than-hoped returns from both Final Fantasy 16 and, going by Square Enix's latest financial reports, the more recent and currently PS5-only Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.\n Read more",

          "description": "Silent Hill has a messy, up-is-down relationship with time and history, so let's go about this hands-on with the Silent Hill 2 Remake in a messy, up-is-down way. Developed well over two decades ago, the original Silent Hill 2 is the magnum opus of Polish horror stalwarts Bloober Team. Running on then-innovative \"Unreal Engine 5\" technology created by Jazz Jackrabbit publishers Epic MegaGames, it's a wonderful abyss of a game that remains perfectly playable today, given a certain amount of tolerance for the quirks of the era.\nIt begins with your character, James Sunderland, descending from the road towards the eponymous Midwestern nowhere-town. Like many games of the period, Silent Hill 2 uses a third-person, over-the-shoulder manual camera, which allows you to glance fearfully up at the monstrous pine trees that fringe the path - each rising from a bulging tide of fog that menaces with the suggestion of approaching figures. There is moisture everywhere, gushing from drain pipes and dribbling down concrete barriers. As you amble into the murk, deathly chords and groaning, unmechanical motifs reverberate from somewhere deep underground. \r\n \nRead more",

The 2022 version of Modern Warfare 2 lacked the original’s multiplayer, and H2M was so highly-anticipated that Steam sales of the 2016 FPS balooned in the lead-up to the mod’s planned release date. It didn't hurt that Activision had it on sale, of course, but the timing lined up so well that some fans speculated the discount was a deliberate bait-and-switch on the publisher’s part to profit from excitement over a mod they were already planning to shut down.\nRead more",

          "description": "When Bloober and Konami announced that they were remaking Silent Hill 2 as part of a comprehensive series reboot, it made immediate if slightly deflating sense to me. Silent Hill 2 is the more feted of the Hills - if I were a calculating franchise custodian tasked with 'bringing back' one of the acclaimed original trilogy, that's probably the instalment I and my spreadsheets would fix upon. I mean, it's the game with Pyramid Head in it - the nearest thing Silent Hill has to a mascot, and it's not like there's an issue of cutting out plot material: each game in the Silent Hill series is, on some level, a distinct story with a distinct protagonist.\nStill, the decision to 'skip' the first game in the series, whose world, narrative themes, music and art direction set the parameters for all the rest, made my brain itch a bit, and when I ran into Bloober's creative director Mateusz Lenart and lead producer Maciej Głomb at a Konami event, I had to ask about it. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Out of all the guns in the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 beta, the Jackal PDW is the clear stand-out amongst the mix. Its versatility is unmatched, offering both smooth mobility and robust firepower. And with a few strategic adjustments, you can enhance its performance even further. We're here to show you how to create the best Jackal PDW loadout in Black Ops 6 beta, empowering you to dominate the battlefield.\n\n\nWhat is the best build for the Jackal PDW in Black Ops 6 beta?\n\n\nTo create the best build for the Jackal PDW in Black Ops 6 beta, equip these attachments:\n\n\n\nMagazine: Extended Mag II\n\n\nUnderbarrel: Ranger Foregrip\n\n\nRear Grip: Commando Grip\n\n\nStock: Balanced Stock\n\n\nFire Mods: 9MM Parabellum FMJ\n\n\n\nSince SMGs are relatively compact in ammo capacity, equip the Extended Mag II to compensate for it. You'll get 50 bullets out of it without sacrificing too much mobility. Then, you can start upping the Jackal PDW's damage with the 9MM Parabellum FMJ Fire Mod. The Rapid Fire mod can be a good asset, too, but it can be challenging to handle with recoil control.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe rest of the attachments help out with handling and mobility, including the Ranger Foregrip's increase in Movement and Sprinting Speed. The Commando Grip also boosts Aim Down Sight Speed, making it easier to target multiple enemies. Last but not least is the Balanced Stock, which improves mobility altogether.\n\n\nCombining these attachments produces one of the best Jackal PDW builds in Black Ops 6 beta, perfect for its small-scale maps. Plus, you can attach the Dexterity Perk to it to reduce motion while jumping, sliding, and diving. Together, they'll make you a mobility master, getting you one step closer to the beta's max level cap.\n\nThe post Best Jackal PDW loadout in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 beta appeared first on Destructoid.",

From the earliest days of Oblivion Lost all the way to the release of the open-source port of GSC Game World's X-Ray engine, it's quite fascinating. How likely, though, is it that STALKER 2 tops all that?\n\n\nHere's the thing about STALKER 2: the odds of it truly substituting and improving upon every single aspect of its predecessors are remarkably slim.

It's a game-changer for sure, compared to the limited number of options you have at the beginning.\n\n\nImage via Destructoid\n\n\nHow to use custom loadouts in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 beta?\n\n\nOnce a custom loadout is available, you can tweak the following aspects:\n\n\n\nPrimary Weapon\n\n\nSecondary Weapon\n\n\nMelee Weapon\n\n\nTactical Equipment\n\n\nLethal Equipment\n\n\nField Upgrade\n\n\nPerks\n\n\nCombat Specialty\n\n\nWildcard\n\n\n\nOnce you have unlocked the loadouts, you'll still need to keep grinding and leveling up. The beginner weapons have their limitations, and that will remain even when you build your loadouts. As you level up, you'll unlock new guns, and they just feel better to use.

Here’s what you need to know below. \n\n\nWhere is the secret area of Chapter 3 in Black Myth: Wukong?\n\n\nWhen you cross the bridge and get into the big snowy valley at the Snow-Veiled Trail, you may see this giant icy wall you can go into. This place is called The Great Pagoda, which is the key to finding the secret area of Chapter 3.

          "description": "August 16 marked the return of the Alien saga to the big screen after a seven-year absence. Director Fede Álvarez's Alien: Romulus sprung into theaters everywhere and has since made waves in both ways good and bad. While it has drawn critique for its perceived over-reliance on franchise hallmarks and callbacks, others have showered the film with praise. Numerous critics and moviegoers alike were intrigued by the story, satisfied with the frights and overall content to call it a solid entry in the Alien canon.\n\n\nDespite plenty of people out there believing it to be one of the film's greatest weaknesses, countless Alien die-hards were happy to see so many references and allusions to previous installments. After all, Romulus is an indirect sequel to director Ridley Scott's 1979 classic, Alien…",

But one game is more pivotal in my gaming career than any of the others, and I don’t think it will ever be beaten.\n\n\nTo preface this, I did briefly play the original 1998 Nintendo 64 release at my cousin's house, although I was only seven at the time, and my parents were not happy with my choice of video game at the time. After that, I dived in and out of South Park games when they were released, and I have glorious memories of playing South Park Rally, much to the chagrin of my parents. \n\n\nHowever, my first true deep dive into the world of South Park games came much later, when The Stick of Truth was released back in 2014 (as if I didn’t feel old enough writing this already). \n\n\nScr…",
