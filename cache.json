The dregs of humanity hang onto life and go to war over the remaining food, fuel, and shelter.

Many players have been stuck in offline mode and have yet to find a reason why. But fear not; we're here to guide you on what this could mean and possible fixes.\n\n\nMultiversus stuck in offline mode, explained\n\n\nOne of the primary reasons you may find yourself stuck in Multiversus' offline mode is due to an age restriction. If your WB Games account is under 18, you can only access certain features, which keeps you offline. This restriction is likely in place to prevent younger players from making in-game purchases.\n\n\nImage via Player First Games\n\n\nIt's important to note that you can't change your age directly in-game, as this feature seems to be tied to your WB Games account. Additionally, if you haven't updated the game file, you may encounter this issue. Multiversus was initially set to offline mode before its full release, so installing the necessary updates is crucial. This method is mostly catered towards those who have previously installed the game during its Early Access.  \n\n\nIt's important to remember that Multiversus is still in its early stages, and errors like this are more common at this phase. That said, it could mean that servers are currently down when attempting to join online. Follow the Multiversus page to stay updated on issues, including server downtimes.\n\n\nIf all else fails, check to see if your internet connection is stable. LAN connections work best, too, to help with laggy performances.\n\nThe post Why is my Multiversus in offline mode? appeared first on Destructoid.",

Diablo 4 became the first Activision Blizzard title to join subscription service in March, and players started speculating which franchise would be next. As rumors intensified, Microsoft reportedly had internal debates about putting Call of Duty on Game Pass because there was a risk it would hurt the revenue generated by yearly releases. \n\n\nPlaying games on day one requires an Ultimate Game Pass subscription, which costs $16.99 monthly. Call of Duty games typically cost $69.99 or $99.99, depending on which version you purchase. The cost discrepancy forced Microsoft to weigh the benefits of each option, but a choice has now been made. \n\n\nIs Call of Duty Black Ops 6 on Xbox Game Pass?\n\n\nImage via Activision\n\n\nMicrosoft confirmed that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be available on day one with an Xbox Game Pass subscription.

The series of teaser videos has already hinted at it.

Listen!\n\n\nWhen did LEOG builds get so expensive? I will admit, looking at the build, I didn't expect it to have 2,500 pieces as the listing says it does, so that may just be the going price for that many bricks these days.

It's a bit too steep for me, even though it would look pretty nifty as a piece on my shelf.\n\n\nThose who pre-order by June 7 will also get a free Water Park gift, which absolutely does not fit with the theme of The Legend of Zelda or the Great Deku Tree, but hey, more LEGO I guess.\n\n\nThe Great Deku Tree confirms long-withstanding rumors that LEGO was indeed working on a Zelda set.

          "description": "Wuthering Waves has turned out to be a pretty solid addition to the gacha game lineup, sporting an intense combat system and a solid amount of power systems and collection mechanics that have kept me playing over its first few days. Still, like many game releases, not everything has gone smoothly, and the first few days since release have been plagued with issues.\n\n\nKuro Games has been working hard to correct many of these issues, and some patches have already started to roll out. To further apologize for the rough start, Kuro Games has also been handing out some goodies to players. The most anticipated of these is a voucher for a free basic 5-star unit.\n\n\n\n\nHow Do You Get the Free 5-star Voucher?\n\n\nGetting the voucher is as simple as opening the mail. \n\n\nA letter will be sent to your mailbox, containing an item called the Voucher of Reciprocal Tides. Once you have acquired your item, simply go to the banners page and there will be an option to exchange the voucher for a basic 5-star unit. The units available are as follows: \n\n\n\nVerina\n\n\nEncore\n\n\nLingyang\n\n\nJianxin\n\n\nCalcharo\n\n\n\nPlayers can also choose a 5-star they already own to get a node unlock on the character's Resonance Chain.\n\n\nPlayers don't have to make the decision immediately, as the voucher is good through May 22, 2025. That said, for new or free-to-play players the free pull is more than worth using ASAP. I suggest pulling Verina to get the best-in-class support in the game, or Calcharo for very solid DPS, but each player is free to make a decision that best fits their party needs. \n\n\nPlayers will also receive 10 free Radiant Tides if they have reached Union Level 2 or higher, allowing them to roll for more chances at Jiyan. Between the free 5-star, these rolls, and the rest of the Lustrous Tides players receive throughout the game, no one should have trouble getting a solid team together for their journey in Wuthering Waves. \n\nThe post Wuthering Waves players can claim a free 5-star character for launch troubles appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s easier said than done if you know what to look for. \n\n\nThat said, here’s where you can find a Requiem Obelisk in Warframe, along with a handy map to guide your way and how to activate them. \n\n\nAll Requiem Obelisk locations in Warframe\n\n\nA Requiem Obelisk can be found in the open world sections in the Cambion Drift on Deimos. It does not matter if you choose to play it as a Free Roam objective or through a Bounty. \n\n\nOnce here, you’ll notice these broken-down spires that have the symbols that you can see on Requiem mods. Here are all the locations on the Cambion Drift map for reference:\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe red circles above show where an Obelisk may spawn, but it isn’t guaranteed they’d always be there. However, there will be at least three you can find if you follow this map. \n\n\nYou can also find a few, go back to the Necralisk or your Orbiter, then go again. But that can be a waste of time with all the loading screens. The time cycle in the Cambion Drift doesn’t mean anything either. The Obelisks can spawn at any time.\n\n\nYou can also find these Obelisks underground when taking on the Isolation Vault bounties. These count toward the weekly challenge, too. \n\n\nHow to activate a Requiem Obelisk\n\n\nTo activate a Requiem Obelisk, you need to unlock your Operator or Drifter. With either one of them, use their respective weapon and shoot at the Obelisk. You can also use a fully-built amp for this to work as long as it deals Void damage. \n\n\nIf done correctly, the Obelisk should reconstruct itself and attract a mob of Infested enemies. Upon the tower coming together, you should make progress in completing this Nightwave challenge. Do this three times, and the 4,500 Nightwave standing is all yours. \n\nThe post How to activate a Requiem Obelisk in Warframe: Locations and more appeared first on Destructoid.",

Well, don't put your money away just yet, as we're already onto the next one.\n\n\nBeginning yesterday, the Steam Open World Survival Crafting Fest (and breathe) offers discounts on a series of well-known and slightly less well-known games from, well, Open World Survival Crafting games. You've got until Monday, June 3 at 10 a.m. PT to choose from what I would say is a pretty good list of titles.\n\n\n\n\nTake a quick look on the sales page to see for yourself. Want 30% off Sons of the Forest? Of course you do. How about 33% off Project Zomboid? An odd number, but sure! Or maybe you want to get Stranded Deep, Valheim, or Subnautica for 50% off each. Even Palworld is there, at 10% off the regular asking price.\n\n\nSummer lovin'\n\n\nThese events seem to come around more often these days. However, we're not quite at the big Steam Summer Sale just yet. That begins in a few weeks. You can keep an eye on the SteamDB countdown if you really want to see exactly when it's scheduled to begin.\n\n\nCrafting and survival games feel like they shouldn't be as popular as they are. But as we can see here, there are still so many offerings, largely from more independent studios. A lot of them are pretty decent as well, in my experience.\n\n\nThere are definitely more than a few in the sale that I'm keen to try out; Sons of the Forest, Project Zomboid, maybe even Enshrouded. Can I afford all these games? Check back with me later.\n\nThe post Sons of the Forest and Palworld are part of Steam’s Open World Survival Crafting Fest appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Are you thrilled about the possibility of a new Doom game? If you've clicked on this article, chances are good you're pretty pumped. There have been rumors about a new reveal for a bit now, and we'll find out whether it was worth getting excited soon enough.\n\n\nAccording to an exclusive report from Insider Gaming, not only is there a chance that id Software could unveil a new Doom entry at this year's Xbox Games Showcase, the game's final title is said to be finalized. At one point, it was going to be called \"Year Zero,\" but it seems as though it's going with \"The Dark Ages.\" It's also said to have been in development for the past four years, so pretty much as soon as Eternal was complete.\n\n\n\n\nThe Xbox Games Showcase will be taking place on June 9, and will be a chance for Microsoft to discuss some exclusive games in its upcoming roster, though it's difficult to know exactly what's going to be on the schedule. The show will be immediately followed by a deep dive into Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.\n\n\nA look at the Slayer's past?\n\n\nWhile details about the new Doom are pretty scarce, the report and video above say there's a chance we could be going back in time, perhaps to Medieval times. The title The Dark Ages  does suggest it could take place in that time period, giving us a glimpse into the Doom Slayer's life back in days of yore.\n\n\nOf course, all expectations must be tempered at this point. As solid as these rumors sound, we're best off waiting until June 9 to see what's going to be confirmed. We're also hoping we'll get to see more Avowed during the showcase.\n\n\nPlaying my first Doom game as a young whippersnapper, I never thought the series would endure as much as it has. Although the team has changed over the decades, id Software's legendary FPS is not just trying to keep its head above the water; it's thriving in an increasingly competitive market. Here's to more demon slaying with whatever's on the horizon.\n\nThe post A new Doom will reportedly be announced at Xbox Games Showcase appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Call of Duty coming to Xbox Game Pass has been a topic of discussion since Microsoft's acquisition of Activision was announced. Now, Xbox has confirmed that Black Ops 6 will be on Game Pass from release day. \n\n\nTeasers for the next installment of the Call of Duty franchise dropped throughout last week, eventually leading to the official Black Ops 6 reveal on May 23. Now, on May 28, the official live-action reveal trailer has arrived, along with news confirming Black Ops 6 on Game Pass. \n\n\nIn a post on the Xbox website, Microsoft confirmed that they were \"excited to confirm that Game Pass members will be able to jump into Black Ops 6 on day one,\" a huge move for the series. \n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft didn't go into any more details about the decision, pointing players towards the Black Ops 6 Direct set for June 9 that will follow the Xbox Games Showcase. There, Activision and Treyarch will \"share even more details on what's coming in this all-new Call of Duty,\" including a first look at gameplay. \n\n\nWhile Microsoft president Sarah Bond had previously stated that all titles from their developers would appear on Game Pass, there was still some uncertainty around Call of Duty. While it was expected that older titles would be added to the platform, the decision to release this year's game on the service on launch day is huge, especially considering that CoD games regularly dominate the year's best-seller charts. \n\n\nHow this will affect sales of the FPS title remains to be seen, but it marks a seismic shift for the franchise and could help to boost player count when people don't have to drop $70 to try the game out. With the success of CoD's free-to-play battle royale Warzone already bringing players back to the franchise, it feels like a golden age of CoD could be upon us again. \n\nThe post Microsoft confirms Black Ops 6 on Xbox Game Pass at launch appeared first on Destructoid.",

This would make it the perfect candidate to launch on Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft's gaming subscription service, in order to bring new subscribers in. Black Ops 6 was officially revealed last week, and while it was reported to be in consideration for a Game Pass launch, today, the news was confirmed from Xbox itself. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will launch on Game Pass day one.\nWe don't know much about the game yet, but two live-action teasers have been released so far. The first features a group of people covering the faces of Mount Rushmore with blindfolds that say, \"The truth lies.\" The second, released today, can be seen below.\n\n\nIt features world leaders' black and white camera footage speaking in hushed tones about a grand conspiracy about manufactured wars and the elusive nature of the truth. The trailer ends with the game's full title, along with a reminder that the full reveal will come on June 9, after Xbox's summer showcase.\nFor more Call of Duty, check out our reviews for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III and Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War.",

However, the story of the game –in Street Fighter 6's case, World Tour – also plays a big role.\n\"From an outsider's perspective, when you see the characters…",

And so, the version in the game is my version, which in the Cuban community is a very controversial version, and I stand by it. I still haven’t told my mom about any of this, by the way.

Released in 2007 for the PlayStation 3, the game featured Andy Serkis just a few years removed from his work on the Lord of the Rings films, and is a weird action game that has incredible moments of action that doesn't last quite as long as you'd like. It's a special game to me, however, and one I am always happy to revisit. I am pessimistic, but I would love to play a version of the game at 60 FPS.\n\n\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

Following that March reveal, developer A Heartful of Games and publisher Outright Games has largely gone quiet. Today, the publisher revealed what players can expect from the Deluxe and Collector's Editions of Mutants Unleashed if they want to splurge on the game when it arrives later this year.\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed allows you to take control of the four turtles in a 3D brawler/platformer for up to two players. The premium editions of the game will provide additional physical goodies for fans of the franchise. The Deluxe Edition includes the game, an exclusive steelbook, four pin badges, four keychains, and an artbook. Meanwhile, the Collector's Edition includes the game, Season Pass, pizza van statue, LED sign, five pin badges, four patches, a mouse mat, notebook, pen, artbook, poster, stickers, and a collector's box. The Deluxe Edition retails for $60, while the Collector's Edition will set you back $200.\nOddly enough, both the Deluxe and Collector's Editions are exclusive to the PlayStation 5 and Switch versions of the game. If you're not planning to experience this title on those systems, but still want to at least play through the game, you're in luck, as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleahsed arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC later this year.\nFor more on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in video games, be sure to read our in-depth feature on the history of the video game franchise here, and if you want something else to look forward to, read a comment from TMNT co-creator Kevin Eastman on the upcoming video game based on The Last Ronin here.",

While the prime example on everyone's mind is likely Xbox's recent acquisition of Activision Blizzard, several have already occurred in 2024. The latest was announced today by Atari, which confirmed it is acquiring its longtime rival, Intellivision.\nAtari announced it has purchased the Intellivision brand and more than 200 games from Intellvision Entertainment. As part of the deal, Intellivision Entertainment will rebrand and continue developing and distributing the Amico game console with a license from Atari to distribute new versions of Intellivision games on the console. Atari will also look to expand digital and physical distribution of legacy Intellivision games, potentially create new games, and explore licensing opportunities. \n\"This was a very rare opportunity to unite former competitors and bring together fans of Atari, Intellivision, and the golden age of gaming,\" chairman and CEO of Atari Wade Rosen said in a press release. \n\"Atari has been a valuable partner and we have every confidence they will be a responsible steward of the storied Intellvision brand,\" CEO of Intellivision Entertainment Phil Adam said. \"We look forward to our expanded collaboration and bringing a broad array of new Atari and Intellivision titles to the Amico and Amico Home family gaming platforms.\"\nAtari has been experiencing a bit of a re-emergence in the public consciousness lately. In addition to other acquisitions, such as Nightdive Studios and Digital Eclipse, Atari has also published well-received games like Mr. Run and Jump and Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration. For more on Atari's outlook and current strategy, be sure to listen to a 2023 episode of All Things Nintendo, which featured an in-depth conversation with Wade Rosen right here.",

Immediately following the presentation, there will be a second livestream to highlight an upcoming game in a \"beloved\" series. Today, the subject of that showcase has been revealed, and surprising no one, it's a new Call of Duty game.\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 6 is a title that might confuse some, seeing as there technically isn't a game titled Black Ops 5. This is because the fifth entry of the sub-series, which launched in 2021, was Black Ops Cold War, temporarily removing the numbered naming convention. The news was announced on social media, but was accompanied by a teaser on YouTube that seems to hint at the events of the game's campaign.\n\n\nThe 40-second clip follows a group of people sneaking onto the top of Mount Rushmore, where they place blindfolds over the eyes of the presidents carved into the mountainside. The first three blindfolds read, \"The truth lies,\" while the fourth features a three-headed wolf logo that was used in the initial redacted teaser of the game.\nThe game will be revealed in full during a presentation on Saturday, June 9, immediately following the Xbox showcase that will start at 10 AM PT/ 1 PM ET. Microsoft is reportedly debating on whether or not the launch the game on Game Pass.\nWhat are you hoping to see from the newest Call of Duty? Let us know in the comments!",

          "description": "We’ve known since October 2022 that Season 3 of Netflix’s The Witcher would be actor Henry Cavill’s last as Geralt of Rivia and that Liam Hemsworth would don the silvery mane going forward. Today, Netflix released the first teaser trailer for Season 4 giving fans their first look at Hemsworth in the role.\n\n\nUnfortunately, Hemsworth doesn’t speak in the brief clip, so we still don’t know how his Geralt voice compares to Cavill’s (or the games, for that matter). But he definitely doesn’t look out of place as the White Wolf and, hopefully, won’t be too much of a distraction in this new season.\nSeason 4 is currently in production in the UK and will be filmed back-to-back with Season 5, which will also be the show's finale. It has no release date but is speculated to premiere in 2025. These last two seasons will cover the three remaining Witcher books: Baptism of Fire, The Tower of the Swallow, and Lady of the Lake. The returning cast includes Anya Chalotra (Yennifer) and Freya Allan (Ciri). \nFor more on The Witcher games, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt got its official PC mod tools this week.

          "description": "Crytek has announced the release date for Hunt: Showdown’s new-gen update, which will also conclude support for the current console versions. This update was first announced last September and will essentially force last-gen players to migrate to current consoles to continue playing the popular shooter. \nIn a developer update, general manager David Fifield announced that the CryEngine 5.11 Update will go live on August 15. This update is treated as a “significant relaunch” that brings native PS5/Xbox Series X/S support along with a host of technical improvements. However, it also means the PS4 and Xbox One versions will become unplayable.\nThat means these players must upgrade to current hardware to continue playing their copies of the game. Crytek assures these players that if they decide to upgrade, player accounts, entitlements, and all owned DLC will transfer to the new-gen version for no extra cost. \n\n\nIn addition to technical improvements, the 5.11 Update also introduces a new map and biome. In the months leading to 5.11’s launch, Crytek plans to address community and survey feedback. That includes improved reporting systems to address cheating and toxic player behavior, design reworks tackling hunter revival, health chunks, restorations, burning down hunters, and reducing stalemates. The game is also getting a new user interface, and Crytek will continue evolving the game's recruitment and prestige progression requirements. \nHunt: Showdown first launched for Xbox and PC in 2019, with the PS4 version arriving in 2020. The PvPvE first-person shooter is set in 1865 Louisiana as players, either alone or with two or three friends, hunt supernatural bounties in the bayou while fending off other player-controlled bounty hunters. \nFor more on Crytek, you can read about the studio's next big project, Crysis 4.",

It simultaneously premiered in theaters and on Peacock on October 27, 2023, and still managed to be a massive box office success. Grossing $297 million globally, it became the year's highest-grossing horror film, Blumhouse’s highest-grossing film ever, and the most-watched movie on Peacock for five straight days. \nThe tagline for Five Nights At Freddy's 2 reads, \"Anyone can survive five nights. This time, there will be no second chances.\" The sequel’s cast has not been announced, but the original starred Josh Hutchinson and included Matthew Lillard, Elizabeth Lail, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Piper Rubio. Director Emma Tammi is returning to direct the sequel, with FNAF creator Scott Cawthorn and Blumhouse founder Jason Blum once again assuming producer roles. \nFNAF 2 won't be the only video game film arriving in 2025. Mortal Kombat 2, the sequel to the 2021 reboot film, was recently confirmed to release in October of that year.",

Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days.

But it seems like the fallout from this recent boom in popularity hasn't died down quite yet. Thanks to a teaser shared on Fortnite's official social media pages, we know that Fallout will be coming to Fortnite pretty soon\npic.twitter.com/AKjFXVnHST\nMay 17, 2024\nThe teaser image shows power armor in a cloud of orange dust, accompanied by what appears to be some sort of industrial building. Other than that, there's not much to go on, but we can make educated guesses. For one, Fortnite's current season will end on May 24, so this is the perfect time to tease the skins that might be coming in the next battle pass. And if it's anything like the recent Avatar: The Last Airbender and Star Wars crossovers, we might see Fallout-themed mechanics or areas appear on the battle royale map itself.\nIt will almost certainly involve some sort of cosmetic pack as well, which could include characters from the games, the Amazon Prime show, or both. Thanks to the teaser, we know power armor will be making an appearance, but it's unclear whether it will be an item to equip in-game or a skin that can be unlocked or purchased.\nFor more Fortnite news, read about its recent crossover with Billie Eilish, its decision to allow players to block certain emotes, and its huge and mysterious collaboration with Disney.\nWhat are you hoping to see included in this crossover?

          "description": "Microsoft is reportedly planning to launch this year's Call of Duty on its Xbox Game Pass subscription service, according to The Wall Stree Journal. This follows reports in previous weeks indicating Microsoft and Xbox were mulling over whether or not to launch the next iteration in the franchise on Game Pass, out of fear it might hurt sales. \nAfter acquiring Activision Blizzard for a colossal $69 billion last year, fans and analysts have speculated about how Microsoft will handle the Call of Duty franchise moving forward. It will obviously be a big draw for Xbox Game Pass, pulling in new subscribers, but most every year, the new Call of Duty is the best-selling game of the year – save for last year, where Hogwarts Legacy took that crown – and a Game Pass launch could affect those sales numbers. \n\n\nHowever, this new report from The Wall Street Journal seemingly clears the air around that topic. \n\"Microsoft plans a major shake up of its video game sales strategy by releasing the coming installment of Call of Duty to its subscription service instead of the longtime, lucrative approach of only selling it a la carte,\" the story reads. \nOf course, things could change so we'll see what happens. It's likely we'll be learning what the next Call of Duty game is next month as part of the gaming showcase summer that includes Summer Game Fest, Ubisoft Forward, and an Xbox Games Showcase followed by a secret direct that is probably focused on Call of Duty.\n[Source: The Wall Street Journal]\nWhat setting do you hope the next Call of Duty takes place in?

          "description": "2K will reveal the next iteration of one of its biggest franchises at Summer Game Fest. Fans online are already speculating what it could be, considering some of 2K's biggest franchises are prime for a new game. \nAs for when to expect this new game, the official SGF X (formerly Twitter) account says it will be announced on June 7, during the Summer Game Fest livestream that begins at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET. That's less than a month away so we don't have to speculate too long on what this mystery iteration could be. \n2K plans to reveal the next iteration in one of 2K's biggest and most beloved franchises at @SummerGameFest on Friday, June 7. pic.twitter.com/1vyFXE2N4z\nMay 16, 2024\nWhile there are plenty of 2K franchises that fit the bill, our eyes are on three franchises: Borderlands, Mafia, and BioShock. \nThe last mainline Borderlands entry – Borderlands 3 – hit PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in 2019, and with the live-action Borderlands movie hitting theaters this August, a new game would make sense. However, we did just get New Tales From The Borderlands in 2022, if you're looking for something to play through in that universe. \nOn the Mafia front, the last mainline entry was Mafia III in 2016, although 2K released Mafia: Definitive Edition – a remake – in 2020. And we know the next Mafia game is in development, too, so it might be time for an announcement. \nBioShock has been dormant since BioShock Infinite in 2013, unless you count the 2016 remasters, and we know 2K created Cloud Chamber in 2019 to work on the next entry in the franchise. It's been almost five years since then, so SGF seems like a great moment to announce the next BioShock. Speaking of, here's what we want in a BioShock 4. \nSGF returns to Los Angeles next month, with the live showcase happening on June 7.

While the launch seemed more in reach now that we’re nearly midway through 2024, it appears we’ll have to wait another full year before playing it.\nPublisher Take-Two released its 2024 year-end financial report today (thanks, PC Gamer), in which it states that Rockstar is targeting a Fall 2025 release window for GTA VI. This timing is reiterated in a calendar of the publisher’s upcoming releases, posted below.\nRegarding GTA VI, Take-Two states, “We are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase.” The game is slated to release for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. A PC version has yet to be mentioned. \nGrand Theft Auto VI takes players to a modern-day Vice City (the franchise's parody of Miami, FL) and stars two protagonists, a female inmate named Lucia and her still-unnamed criminal male partner. To say anticipation is high would be an understatement; the premiere trailer garnered over 100 million views in only 24 hours, breaking a YouTube record. \nAs we continue the long wait for Grand Theft Auto VI’s launch, check out our video of Game Informer’s two resident Florida Men reacting to the debut trailer.

It's a fantastic game that should be welcomed with open arms as it makes its way to a new platform, but we were specifically curious about how it performs on Steam Deck. The game is not Steam Deck verified primarily because certain features are not supported on Valve's handheld, or other comparable mobile PC game platforms. However, the offline content (the single-player campaign and the expansion) has been specifically adjusted to play well on Steam Deck. You can read port studio Nixxes Software explanation here. And spending a little time with the game shows that the single-player campaign does, in fact, play well on Steam Deck. It's not without its shortcomings – a high-end PC or a PlayStation 5 are still the best ways to play the game – but Steam Deck appears to be a great way to play the game if that's your only option or you want a portable version.\nYou can check out some gameplay with commentary from myself and Wesley LeBlanc below.\n\n\nHead to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

          "description": "Activision, the developer-publisher Microsoft and Xbox purchased for $69 billion last year, has formed a new studio called Elsewhere Entertainment, and it is developing a new \"narrative-based and genre-defining AAA franchise.\" The studio is based in Warsaw, Poland, and, according to a report from IGN, it is not working on a Call of Duty-related project. \nThis studio, which has been formed behind-the-scenes before today's public unveiling, arrives roughly one week after Xbox closed four Bethesda studios, including Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks and Redfall team Arkane Austin. While the company has yet to publicly address the closures directly, Xbox president Sarah Bond said in an interview that the closures were about keeping the business healthy in the long-term. It's why news of this new studio might be surprising, given one week ago, the parent company of Activision was closing studios to cut costs. \n\n\n\"Built from the ground up, Elsewhere Entertainment is a premier and standalone studio dedicated to establishing an environment that inspires bold and diverse ideas,\" a blog post reads. \"The team's underlying mission encourages everyone to explore and collaborate creatively to craft a franchise with an enduring legacy that resonates far beyond games. [The] new studio has full access to Activision's resources and tools as it continues to increase production and development. \n\"Elsewhere is opening its search for best-in-class talent from across the industry and around the world to help create a state-of-the-art and next generation gaming experience.\" \nElsewhere is currently made up of developers with experience working on franchises like The Last of Us, Uncharted, The Witcher, Cyberpunk 2077, Destiny, Tom Clancy's The Division, and Far Cry. \nWhat kind of game do you hope Elsewhere makes? Let us know in the comments below!",
