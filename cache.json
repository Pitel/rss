That is, as long as you have a Nintendo Switch Online subscription, of course.\nIf you have somehow managed to last this long without picking up Vampire Survivors, we can't recommend it highly enough. The game is a tough sell. It's a top-down, pixel-art roguelike where you kill hoards of monsters with a series of ever-upgrading auto-firing weapons, but on launch last year, we couldn't put it down.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

However, with the help of Limited Run Games, the developers are now revisiting this 'lost' chapter in the series, with the now-completed game getting a limited-time release on Game Boy Advance and a wider modern console release courtesy of Limited Run's Carbon Engine later this year.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Helldivers 2's Cutting Edge Premium warbond, aka DLC battle pass, is now available to buy in-game, and it is chock-full of oddball gadgetry such as lightning shotguns, burst-fire laser rifles and experimental armour. As with the Arc Thrower stratagem, the lightning shotgun fires arcs of electricity that conduct between players and enemies alike, but there's a fresh armour perk, Electrical Conduit, which reduces arc damage by 95%, allowing close-knit teams of Helldivers to roll around the battlefield frazzling themselves without much penalty. \nStill, I think the real star pick here is surely the Localization Confusion booster, which extends the time between enemy spawns, allowing weirdo solo players such as myself to disentangle from a dragged-out gunfight a little more gracefully.\nRead more",

          "description": "Cast your eye over the original Outcast from 1999 today, and you'll find a world that's more abstract than alien. Hazy, almost block colour textures are stretched to breaking point over terrain that looks like it's been pulled and poked by a child sculpting in putty slime, while its cast of beige, three-fingered Talans are so rigid that they'd all be reigning champions at the local robot dance-off. Understandable, given the era in which is was made, but even so - what a difference 25 years make. Even after 2017's remake glow-up with Outcast: Second Contact, A New Beginning's version of Adelpha is a lush and verdant paradise, with treetops soaring over your head, and mountains requiring several triple or quadruple jetpack jumps to traverse. It's no Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora, admittedly, but it leans in very much the same direction, punching your eyeballs with such bright, primary colours that you'll feel enticed to explore every inch of it.\nA shame, then, that all its visual splendour amounts to is little more than an empty husk filled with open world busy work that already felt tired and done ten years ago. Its non-linear approach to storytelling remains intact, letting you tackle the quests and problems of its numerous village settlements in any order you wish, but even this has been boiled down to tedious checklists of fetch quests, escort missions and shooting up the same identikit facility one after another. Topping off this fatal combo is returning protagonist Cutter Slade, whose macho army dude dial is still set firmly to cringey wise-cracking and patronising stereotypes. A new beginning this ain't.\nRead more",

It's easily slid into one of my favourite games of the year without question, and presumably, for the hundreds of thousands of others who've also opted into preserving democracy.\nBut there seems to be this sentiment that Helldivers 2's roaring success has come as a shock, so much of a shock that top execs and investors are doing YouTube thumbnail faces in boardrooms with mini-nuke explosions erupting from their heads. Should its success come as that much of a surprise, though? No, probably not.\nRead more",

          "description": "After writing about the upcoming visual novel-ish game Vampire Therapist (in which you are a vampire, acting as a therapist to other vampires) back in the middle of January, developer Cyrus Nemati reached out asking if I'd like to ask him more questions about it. This was surprising, because while I'd been broadly positive about the vibes of Vampire Therapist, I was reasonably concerned about the specifics of how it would all shake down. But it turned out that the critical perspective was something Nemati appreciated, and so we had a chat that dug down into the meat of it all. Although I was initially interested in how he'd come up with the idea of a vampire therapist, it turns out all roads lead back to Twilight's Edward Cullen. \nRead more",

And then you have games like Ereban: Shadow Legacy, which has just been given a release date - 10th April. In this mystical third-person stealth-platformer, your character can literally disintegrate and travel through shadows as a ripple of dark energy - a transformation that puts me in mind less of Thief than of squid-mode in Nintendo's Splatoon. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Unless you’re a long-term fan of his work, you might have asked that upon hearing about Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story, the latest interactive documentary from Digital Eclipse (following on from The Making Of Karateka and Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration). You might have heard Minter’s name in connection with the remake of the unreleased Atari arcade game Akka Arrh in 2023. Maybe you played his mind-warping shooter Polybius in VR. You might remember as far back as the Atari Jaguar and Minter’s phenomenal Tempest 2000, the unexpected highlight of the console’s library. Or perhaps you recall his work from the 8-bit glory days. You could just know him from the daily videos of him feeding his sheep on YouTube.\r\n\n\r\nThe point is that Jeff Minter has been making games for a phenomenally long time – more than 40 years, in fact. And in all that time, he has stayed true to what he believes in. “One of the things we say in the game itself is the idea of him being the last indie developer,” says Chris Kohler, editorial director at Digital Eclipse in California. “The last of the people from the early 80s who very consciously never sold out, never took the money, never looked to expand or do anything other than [be] just Jeff at his computer, making the sorts of video games that he wants to make.”\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's just designed in an \"agnostic\", systems-first way and this in itself makes stealth a possibility. It's also a quiet attempt to capture something of the intricacy of a full-blown military simulator, while still being a very \"arcadey\" game at heart, which owes a little to Arrowhead's own collective time in the military.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I don't know how White Wolf's RPG is viewed in the land of table tops these days, but here in computerville it has delivered exactly one good video game in the last 25 years (and don't come gibbering to me about 2022's Swansong, it wasn't fit to polish Bloodlines' fangs). Sure, Bloodlines 2 might prove a winner, but given years of delays and a developer change, I'll believe it when I see it.\nWhich brings us to Vampire: The Masquerade - Justice, the beleaguered series' first prowl through the rain-slick streets of VR. In theory, this should be exactly my cup of haemoglobin; a gothic, linear stealth game where you use your vampire powers to sneak across the rooftops of Venice. In its mechanics and design, Justice aspires to be a cut down version of Dishonored. Unfortunately, it's in the cutting down where most of its problems arise. It's too cramped, too basic, and too fuzzy around the edges, and the whole experience ends up being a bit mid.\nRead more",

Is Dune appropriative? Is the appropriation the point? Whatever the case, Funcom want you to know that their upcoming survival game Dune: Awakening has nothing to do with any of that, posting a short Xeet from the official Awakening account that's the written equivalent of sticking your arms straight out, waving your hands, and going \"Woahwoahwoah, hang on a minute.\"\n\"We agree that religion is an integral part of the Dune universe. This is why in Dune: Awakening you will meet and interact with people of different religions along your journey. However, as opposed to the story presented in the books, the player is not a messiah and will not play a major role in any of them. Leading people on a holy war is not why you arrive on Arrakis,\" reads the post in full. Personally, I approve of this effort to keep games apolitical. Politics? In my Dune. No thank you.

There's been a certain amount of PlayStation-instigated speculation about whether the meat is CGI-generated, following the last round of Dragon's Dogma 2 previews. Speaking to Japanese site 4Gamer, as translated by Automaton, Itsuno revealed that the game's scenes of sizzling flesh are derived from live action film of steaks being grilled - partly for the sake of authenticity, and partly to save money versus creating computer models of meat products. You can cook several types of meat in Dragon's Dogma, each of which has its own cutscene, and a number of Dragon's Dogmatists are already performatively salivating at the prospect on social media.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Towards the conclusion, one NPC is selected as \"Beloved\" and promptly abducted by a dragon for you to quest forth and rescue. There are a few characters who are positioned more obviously as romanceables, but the brilliance of the system is that you can raise your Affinity with pretty much anybody. If you want to finish the game staring passionately into the eyes of the court jester or that hearty bloke who runs the armour shop, it's within your power.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Zoria: Age Of Shattering speedruns its fantasy RPG origin story in a quick cutscene montage at the start, so we might as well get that out of the way first, too. Low fantasy world, two warring kingdoms, one uses necromancy (this is cast as bad and cheating rather than practical, for some reason) to comprehensively gain the upper hand, and everything is named like a bunch of Scrabble letters were thrown randomly on the table. You play Elion war hero Captain Witherel - gender and class TBD by the player - in a small group making a final stand at the fortress Daeg Marastir, which is being overrun by the nefarious Izirian army. We start in media bellum, as it were.\nThis first stage, where you escape the fortress, gives you a whistle-stop tour of the main systems in the game. You control a squad of four, the combat is turn-based, you can pitch camp at any time to rest and heal up, and there are crafting systems for potions, food and gear. Zoria isn't really remaking the wheel as much as it is taking spokes from a bunch of other fantasy RPGs you like, and the result is the terrier of RPGs. Small, clearly has a lot of different DNA knocking around in there, and punches above its weight, but it's a bit scrappy and sometimes it's knees dislocate and it falls over. This terrier was made by three people, so that is sort of to be expected.\nRead more",

          "description": "Since the summer of 2020, Unknown 9: Awakening has only existed as a 90-second cinematic teaser trailer. In it, a young girl called Haroona is chased through the narrow streets of Calcutta by a rabble of boys armed with sticks. It's not clear why she's attracted their ire, but as one moves to strike her, a shockwave pulses out from her small body, the world turns grey, and time slows down. As she deftly moves out of harm's way, she turns back to look at her stunned onlookers, a confident smirk rising on her face.\nIt was a striking, if utterly ambiguous debut, and with talk of accompanying podcasts, books, comics and a web series also on the way to help build out this new world even further, it felt like developers Reflector Entertainment were really setting out to make a bold and ambitious first impression. But it's now been four years since that trailer. The books, podcasts and comics have all come and gone, seemingly making little impression, and Awakening, the game aiming to pull this big, expanded universe together, has arguably slipped from both time and memory. Perhaps this will change with its newly-dated summer 2024 release window on the horizon, but having seen a small, hands-off slice of an early mission in the game at publisher Bandai Namco's offices a couple of weeks ago, Awakening's certainly got its work cut out for it.\nRead more",

          "description": "A few days ago I had the chance to indulge on an incredible compute nirvana: eight AMD Instinct MI300X accelerators at my disposal for some albeit brief testing. Not only was it fantastic from the shear compute performance, but for Phoronix fans, all the more exciting knowing it's atop a fully open-source software stack from the kernel driver up through the various user-space libraries (well, sans the GPU microcode). This first encounter with the AMD MI300 series was eye-opening in seeing how far the ROCm software stack has come and the increased challenges for NVIDIA going forward with the rising competitiveness of AMD's hardware and software efforts.",

It’s flying high on Steam charts right now, hanging in there as we approach what will be only the game's second weekend since launch. \n\n\n\n\nIn the above post on Twitter, Furcifer celebrated the milestone and shared excitement over the news. \n\n\nBackpack Battles are described as a “PvP inventory management auto-battler” in which you can combine items that have been crafted or purchased by placing them next to each other in your backpack. Certain combinations result in powerful items, which can then be used to cause damage to your opponents. \n\n\nAt the time of writing, Backpack Battles has reached a peak of more than 35,000 consecutive players within the last 24 hours, ranking it one place below Overwatch 2 in the Steam Most Played charts. \n\n\nImage via PlaywithFurcifer\n\n\nBackpack Battles is also doing well when it comes to reviews, which currently sit at ‘Overwhelmingly Positive’ with over 3,000 reviews and a thriving Subreddit. That favor already has a dedicated, helpful community as players pool resources toward discovering new combinations and strategies for tougher battles. \n\n\nIt's another indie gem catching our eye this year, with other favorites taking off just a couple of months into 2024. Balatro, the roguelike deckbuilder from developer LocalThunk, sold more than 250,000 copies within the first three days. That said, this number was obtained across a multitude of platforms, whereas Backpack Battles is only available on Steam. \n\n\nCurrently, you can currently purchase Backpack Battles on its own for $11.69 USD, or there are two bundles available:\n\n\n\nBackpack Battles + Slay the Spire ($33.01 USD)\n\n\nBackpack Battles + Brotato ($15.01 USD)\n\n\nThe post Backpack Battles sells 100,000 units within two days of Early Access release appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Normal-type Castform features many variants depending on the weather, from bright Sunny to gloomy Rainy forms. Those who are lucky may even stumble upon a Shiny rendition, primarily when an event is active. So, if you want to catch this exclusive creature, here's how to get a Shiny Castform in Pokemon Go.\n\n\nWhere to find Shiny Castform in Pokemon Go\n\n\nPlayers will increase their chances of a Shiny Castform by finding them during Weather Week or completing Weather-themed tasks. The event lasts until March 18, 2024, at 8 PM local time, spawning more Castforms into the wilds. According to the Pokémon official website, Weather-themed Field Research tasks produce more encounters with all of the creature's forms, regardless of weather conditions. If you don't see these specific tasks on the board, delete the current objectives and spin PokéStops to trigger their appearance:\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe three tasks included in the Pokémon Go Weather Week Field Research are as follows:\n\n\n\nCatch 5 Pokémon with Weather Boost\n\n\nCatch 7 Pokémon with Weather Boost\n\n\nCatch 10 Pokémon with Weather Boost\n\n\n\nWeather Boosts depend on the conditions of your current area. If it's sunny, certain Pokémon will have a sun icon when capturing them, indicating that the boost is active. The symbol won't always appear, so keep capturing them until all the needs are met. The more Field Research tasks are completed, the more chances you'll get for a Shiny Castform. \n\n\nCastform showcases a total of four forms: Normal, Sunny, Rainy, and Snowy. Typically, you can only get these creatures with the corresponding weather conditions, but it's not a requirement for Weather Week. While the event is active, I recommend obtaining as many Castforms as possible in the hopes of getting its Shiny form. Fortunately, spawns are frequent, so it could be possible to get all four variants. \n\nThe post How to get Shiny Castform in Pokémon Go appeared first on Destructoid.",

Scientists have discovered advanced means to commune with machines, enabling life to overcome the biological limitations of minds and flesh. The Machine Age is developed by Paradox Development Studio and coming soon on PC.\n\n\n\n\nNew Origins\n\n\nThree new Origins, essentially starting parameters in Stellaris, are coming in The Machine Age.\n\n\n\nCybernetic Creed — Your empire pursues a divine calling: the holy fusion of the body and cybernetics. Augmentation is worship.\n\n\nSynthetic Fertility — Once a thriving society, a novel genetic disease leaves your empire unable to reproduce biologically. Digital salvation seems the only option to avoid extinction.\n\n\nArc Welders — Hailing from a world starved for space, a robotic society turns to the stars for resources. \n\n\n\nAlongside the new Origins, The Machine Age also includes new reactive portraits, 6 new Civics, 2 new mid-game structures (the molten Arc Furnace and powerful Dyson Swarm), new Population Traits, and seven brand new music tracks.\n\n\nNew Endgame Crisis, Crisis Path, and more\n\n\nFor the first time in a while, a new Endgame Crisis has been added to Stellaris in the form of a new synthetic threat. Also, a new Crisis Path will allow players to become the threat themselves.\n\n\nPreviously in Stellaris, machine empires were required to use the Gestalt Consciousness Ethic. However, that's no longer the case as machines can have individual personalities and more diverse stories and origins. Machine empires also have access to three new Machine Ascension Paths, further building upon the ability to create a machine empire.\n\n\nStellaris: The Machine Age does not have a release date but according to Paradox is coming soon on PC.\n\nThe post Stellaris: The Machine Age expansion adds new machine-focused Origins and Endgame Crisis appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, while this event appears regularly, knowing its exact start date can help you prepare in advance. Let's talk about when the next Peg-E Prize Drop event will happen.\n\n\nMonopoly GO Peg-E Prize Drop event schedule\n\n\nIn Monopoly GO, Peg-E events typically occur at the beginning and middle of each month, meaning the next one is predicted to start between March 15 and 17 and end five days later. Previous mid-month Prize Drop events began on February 16 and January 16, making March 16 the most likely date, but this can vary slightly with each passing month.\n\n\nThe previous Peg-E event began on March 1 and ended on March 6. Most Peg-E events last five days, giving you several days to collect prize drop chips and obtain as many milestone rewards as possible. You'll also have multiple main events and tournaments to participate in that rewards hundreds of Peg-E Prize Drop chips if you finish all their milestones.\n\n\nWhat is the Peg-E Prize Drop event in Monopoly GO?\n\n\nPeg-E Prize Drop event is a Plinko-styled minigame in Monopoly GO that, in exchange for small event chips, will grant you rewards based on the points you collect. By dropping chips down the game board, you'll receive money depending on which spot it lands in, multiplied by your chip multiplier. You'll also get points by completing bumpers and obtaining money, which accumulates into reward milestones at the bottom of the event screen.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThroughout the event, you'll have the chance to win prizes, typically including dice, sticker packs, and cosmetics. The grand prize is often rare or exclusive items like shield skins, tokens, or wild stickers. Each Peg-E Prize Drop event has slightly different rewards, so it's worth checking each other out to see what you get.\n\nThe post When is the next Peg-E Prize Drop event in Monopoly GO? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "In a new trailer, Little Bat Games revealed a bit more of their upcoming mental health-’em-up, Vampire Therapist. It’s going to take every ounce of my concentration not to accidentally write Vampire Survivors.\n\n\nVampire Therapist puts you in the boots of a vampire who is also a therapist. And also a cowboy, for some reason. Apparently, centuries of experience have done nothing to fortify the well-being of the undead, so they, too, need some therapy. The protagonist, Sam, may be rootin’ tootin’, but he’s new to the psychology trade.\n\n\n\n\nVampire Therapist pulls from the literal cognitive behavioral therapy textbook, incorporating real-world theories into its choice-driven gameplay. According to the Store Page, you’ll be helping lift the mental weight from “self-hating vampires, agoraphobic social media addicts, supernatural narcissists, and victims of centuries-old capitalistic systems.”\n\n\nFrankly, everyone could do with a little more insight into their mental health. Even if you’re not in crisis, the things you learn through cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can help you navigate when things do start to get choppy. Personally, CBT didn’t do much for me, and now I’m with a therapist who does dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT), but that’s not to say that CBT isn’t still an effective treatment. It’s a worthwhile skill to have.\n\n\nAnd despite involving real-world therapy techniques, Vampire Therapist also promises to be a “comedic look through history.” Thank goodness, because too much of the present reality is bad for your mental health.\n\n\nVampire Therapist is currently slated for release in Q2 2024 for PC.\n\nThe post Utilize CBT to help the undead in Vampire Therapist appeared first on Destructoid.",

The wait isn’t long, either, with the first update arriving in just a matter of days. \n\n\n\n\nLet’s look at what’s on the way:\n\n\n\n“Warrior’s Path” - March 20\n\n\n“Boss Attack” - Spring 2024\n\n\n“Divine Trials” - Summer 2024\n\n\nNew Story DLC - Later in 2024\n\n\n\nSpring 2024\n\n\nThe first free update is set to drop on March 20. Officially dubbed “Warrior’s Path”, this update includes two new play modes - Permadeath and Speedrun. There will be four new outfits for Sargon, so there’s plenty to look forward to in this update alone. \n\n\nFollowing that, there will be another free update, although this one has a less solid release time frame. Coming in Spring 2024, the “Boss Attack” update will bring Boss Rush mode to Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown as well as more outfits for Sargon.\n\n\nSummer 2024\n\n\nLater in the year, there will be two more updates, beginning with one in Summer 2024 called “Divine Trials”, which will bring new Combat, Puzzle and Platform challenges to sink your teeth into. Also included in this update will be some new Amulets, yet more outfit choices for Sargon, and further items that have not yet been detailed. \n\n\nLater in 2024\n\n\nThe last update of the year is potentially the most exciting of all. Later on in 2024, although we don’t know when yet, there will be a new story DLC for Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown.

          "description": "Potions are one of the most powerful items in Minecraft, as they can help you heal, damage enemies, or see better in the dark, among other effects. While some potions take one or two materials, invisibility is a multi-step process. Here's how to make every invisibility potion variant in Minecraft.\n\n\nInvisibility Potion Recipes in Minecraft\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThere are three steps to making an invisibility potion in Minecraft:\n\n\n\nPlace a water bottle and Nether Wart in a brewing stand to make an awkward potion.\n\n\nCombine an awkward potion and a golden carrot to make a night vision potion.\n\n\nCombine the night vision potion and fermented spider eye to make an invisibility potion.\n\n\n\nAll three steps require a brewing stand, as this is where you make all your Minecraft potions. From here, you'll make an awkward potion, turn it into a night vision potion, and then convert that to invisibility.\n\n\nFrom here, you can make three additional invisibility potion types using the following recipes:\n\n\n\nExtended Potion: Potion of Invisibility + Redstone\n\n\nSplash Potion: Potion of Invisibility + Gunpowder\n\n\nLingering Potion: Splash Potion of Invisibility + Dragon's Breath\n\n\n\nEach potion has its advantages. While extended invisibility potions increase the duration from three to eight minutes, splash potions allow you to throw it to the ground, giving you an area-of-effect potion. Lastly, lingering potions leave the status effect on the ground, so you can walk in and pick up its buff.\n\n\nHow to make Arrow of Invisibility in Minecraft\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nTo make invisibility arrows in Minecraft, you'll need eight arrows and a lingering potion of invisibility in a crafting bench. Place the potion in the center square and surround it with your arrows to get eight invisibility arrows in return. Doing this allows you to take things a step further by using your arrows to use the effect long-range rather than within throwing distance.\n\nThe post How to make Invisibility Potion in Minecraft appeared first on Destructoid.",

While it uses an angled, ¾ angle camera system, it has a more detailed aiming system, allowing it to feel like a mix of modern and classic design. The amusement park also has you roaming, solving puzzles, and gathering items in a metroidvania/gated exploration sort of way.\n\n\n\n\nI played the demo when it dropped back in October, and have been anticipating this release ever since. I simply love its style and storytelling chops. A new trailer dropped alongside this announcement, which shows off some areas and events that weren’t featured in the demo, so now I’m even more interested. Thankfully, we won’t have to wait long.\n\n\nCrow Country is being released on PC and PS5 on May 9, 2024.

          "description": "It's always interesting when veterans of the gaming industry break off and start new endeavors. And they don't come much bigger than emptyvessel (yes, it's really spelled that way), which is a team of developers consisting of some notable names from the likes of id Software and Naughty Dog.\n\n\nIn a recent video uploaded to YouTube, the new studio has been teasing a work-in-progress. It's a very short clip that reveals nothing, but the \"glitchy\" visuals, hints of violence, and the soundtrack give strong Cyberpunk 2077 vibes. To me, at least.\n\n\nSo far, there's been absolutely no details about what this project is, other than it being described as a \"battle between control and chaos that the system has in store for you.\" We do, however, know that it's got some pretty good pedigree behind it.\n\n\n\n\nJust look at this collective experience\n\n\nLooking at the emptyvessel website, we get to meet the team behind the studio. We're definitely not dealing with amateurs here. For example, general manager Garrett Young has worked with id Software on Doom, Quake, and Rage, but has also worked at Microsoft and Activision.\n\n\nArt Director Alex Palma also has Doom attached to their resume, being a visual designer on the 2016 reboot and Eternal. Alongside them is Colin Thomas, a character designer who spent 15 years at Naughty Dog, working on things like The Last of Us and Uncharted.\n\n\nOh, and Mick Gordon is also part of the team. Guess what his role is?\n\n\nBasically, there's a lot of skill and experience in this new development team. I can already picture the type of games emptyvessel will be pushing out, but I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nThe post Former id Software and Naughty Dog devs are teasing a new project appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Far be it from me to tell you about the current state of the video game industry. Layoffs and studio shutdowns are just one part (big though it may be) of the problem. On top of that, it's also been speculated that consumer spending could drop this year, so it may be up to the likes of GTA 6 to perk things up a bit.\n\n\nThat's according to an interview with Circana analyst Mat Piscatella over on Gamesindustry.biz. According to him, spending on video games in the US could come down by 2% on the more optimistic side. In a worst-case scenario, it could go as low as 10% or even more.\n\n\n\n\nThere are likely a number of factors that could contribute to this, such as the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. However, the report believes that the lack of blockbusters coming in 2024 could also be a reason. For example, we're not going to see GTA 6 or the new Nintendo Switch until 2025, all being well.\n\n\nHelldivers 2 and Palworld can only do so much\n\n\nPiscatella ends by saying that it's \"going to be a tough year,\" but we may see a boost providing things like interest rates come down. He also believes that the eventual (and long-awaited) release of GTA 6 could give the industry a \"renewed batch of interest.\"\n\n\nThe analyst suggests the anticipated follow-up to Grand Theft Auto 5 is vital to the gaming market, saying that there's \"probably never been a more important thing to ever release in the industry.\" He then adds \"so no pressure.\"\n\n\nThis is a rather pessimistic view of the future of video games, but some might say these are rather pessimistic times. Consumer spending in the US could come down by a fair amount, but we should hopefully see a boost. It seems a lot may be riding on the success of GTA 6.\n\nThe post GTA 6 could be the most important thing to ever release, analyst says appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's being developed for both consoles and PC and Gameloft describes it as an \"innovative hybrid of survival, life simulation, and action RPG.\"\nDisney Dreamlight Valley is popular in the life sim genre, mixing fun gameplay, unique customization, and Disney together into a package that players seem to really enjoy. It launched into Early Access back in 2022 before the full release debuted in December. All of this is to say: if you're a fan of Disney Dreamlight Valley and Dungeons & Dragons, there's a new game to keep an eye on. \nCurrently untitled, Gameloft says in its announcement on Instagram that the game is set in the mythical Forgotten Realms, which is also the D&D setting Baldur's Gate 3 takes place in. The game, which will mix survival, life simulation, and action RPG elements into one, will feature \"unique cooperative gameplay,\" the studio says. \n\"Players can expect an adventure where the rich lore of this legendary franchise meets real-time strategy in a unique campaign of resilience, camaraderie, and danger at nearly every turn,\" the announcement reads.\" \nThere's no name for the project and no release window either. Gameloft is currently hiring for the project. \nNews of this D&D game arrives roughly a year after Wizards of the Coast, which owns the D&D IP and is a division within Hasbro, reportedly canceled five unannounced games. The last D&D game released was Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance back in 2021 – read Game Informer's review of it here. \nAre you excited about this game? Let us know in the comments below!",

These debates are often full of superfluous apples-to-oranges comparisons and, as a result, are unlikely to come up with a definitive answer everyone will be happy with. But that's what makes them so fun. In that spirit, we're taking the month of March to hold our own bracket-style tournament, voted on by readers, to determine the greatest video game of all time.\nThough we here at Game Informer assembled the bracket, even that was heavily influenced by our Reader Vote we held in 2018 to coincide with our 300th issue. Using the results of our 2018 Reader Vote combined with some input from staff, general sentiment in various online communities, and critical reception for more recent games, we assembled a starting bracket of 64 games. From here, we'll hold two rounds of voting per week until we whittle this field down to one ultimate winner.\nWill this result in a definitive selection of the best game ever released? Or will it reveal a coordinated effort from a particular gaming community committed to seeing their favorite game rise through the ranks? Only time will tell. \nWhile this is meant to be a fun experiment to see how the results shake out within the Game Informer readership and community, we hope you'll come back to root for your favorites every Monday and Thursday until we are able to crown our champion in the 2024 Game Gauntlet.

          "description": "Developer Ubisoft Montpellier's excellent metroidvania, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, hit consoles and PC in January, and it's still one of Game Informer's top scoring reviews of the year. You can read Game Informer's Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review here to find out why we love it so much. Now, Ubisoft is giving players another reason to jump back in with a new post-launch content roadmap. \nWhat's more, all of the new content coming to the game is set to release throughout the year, starting with new Speedrun and Permadeath modes this month as well as new outfits for Sargon. In spring, a Boss Rush will be released alongside even more outfits for Sargon, and in summer, the Divine Trials update brings new combat, platform, and puzzle challenges as well as new amulets, outfits, and more. All of this will be free, too. \nHowever, later in 2024, new paid story DLC will hit Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, although Ubisoft offers no teases about what to expect. \nIt's an exciting roadmap, doubly so considering the majority of the new content is free. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review, and then check out our breakdown of the four ways Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown gets the metroidvania genre right.

Coincidentally, that patch was centered on Terminids and nerfing spawn rates for Bile Titans and Chargers on the harder difficulties of Helldivers 2. Windows Central reports Shriekers only appear when a \"Shrieker Lair\" is one of the side objectives on a planet, noting they look like \"smaller versions of the mushroom-like Spore Towers that perpetually keep a large area around them covered in a thick haze.\" \n\n\nShrieker Lairs, like the Spore Towers and Terminid egg nests can be destroyed up close and from afar with a well-placed rocket, grenade, or strategem. \nKeep your eyes on the skies, Helldivers and remember...DEMOCRACY.\nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Helldivers 2 review, and then read about a recent patch that introduced meteor showers and fire tornadoes to the game.

This update was in beta last month but rolls out for everyone starting today. \nThe biggest features are coming to the PS5's DualSense controller. The built-in speakers can now produce higher volume sound, which PlayStation says will allow players to hear in-game sounds and voice chat audio more clearly. Plus, the noise cancellation on the controller's built-in mic has been improved. \n\n\n\"The mic input quality on these controllers has been improved, courtesy of a new A.I. machine learning model,\" a PlayStation Blog post reads. \"Background noise from button presses and game audio are suppressed, resulting in a better voice chat experience.\"\nShare Screen is also getting some new features with today's update. Namely, viewers can move a pointer around and send a ping or draw a line on a shared screen, allowing them to highlight objects in-game or guide a player. Plus, viewers can now send emoji-based reactions to the host's screen – these features are turned off by default and the host and viewer must turn them on. PlayStation says these Share Screen features will hit the PS App, which also allows Share Screen, later this month. \nFinally, today's update allows users to adjust the brightness of the PS5 power indicator. Simply go to Settings, then Beep and Light, and then Brightness. \n\n\nFor more, read about the last big PS5 update that added Dolby Atmos, larger SSD capacity, and more to the console, and then check out this story about a retailer listing of a \"V2 DualSense\" with a 12-hour battery life.

          "description": "If you ask any Final Fantasy fan what their top five favorite songs in the franchise are, there's a 99 percent chance one of them is \"To Zanarkand\" from Final Fantasy X. However, it turns out, it wasn't originally intended for the game. \nThis news comes from Audrey (aitaikimochi on X, formerly Twitter), a mega Final Fantasy fan, Twitch streamer, and CEO of Aitai Japan Inc., who translated a recent interview between Weekly Ochiai and Final Fantasy X composer Nobuo Uematsu, whose credits also include One-Winged Angel and Aerith's Theme from Final Fantasy VII and so much more. In that interview, Uematsu revealed \"To Zanarkand\" originally began as a piece for a French flute player, meant to be played during a recital. \n\n\n\"'To Zanarkand' was actually not meant to be the theme for Final Fantasy X,\" Uematsu tells Weekly Ochiai, as translated by Audrey on X. \"There was a flute player from France who originally asked me to write a song for them to play during a recital. When I wrote the piece, I thought perhaps this sounded a bit too sad for a recital. So I set it aside for the time being. \n\"Sometime after, when I was making the score of Final Fantasy X, I was falling behind all the while the producers were hounding me. So since that flute piece was unused, I just kind of meekly handed it to them. They listened to it and said, 'Yes! This is brilliant!'\" \nIn retrospect, it's wild \"To Zanarkand\" wasn't originally composed by Uematsu for Final Fantasy X because it fits the game's themes so well, nailing the somber and sad tone present throughout Tidus and Yuna's journey in Spira. \nFor more about Final Fantasy music, read Game Informer's exclusive four-part series on composer Masayoshi Soken's score for last year's Final Fantasy XVI:\nPart 1: Creating The Prelude\nPart 2: The Victory Fanfare\nPart 3: Finding A Main Theme\nPart 4: The Sound\nAfter that, read Game Informer's review of Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster. \nWhat's your favorite Final Fantasy theme song?

After launching Payday 3, the company is well-positioned to leverage the strengths of the organization to monetize and develop the IP portfolio. I am looking forward to assuming an operative position and, together with the management, ensure the execution of this strategy.\"\nGoeldner has 40 years of experience in the games industry, including several executive positions, according to the notice. His last executive position was as CEO of Focus Home Interactive. He has been a member of Starbreeze's board of directors since last year. Starbreeze has initiated a recruitment process for a permanent CEO. \n\n\nPayday 3 hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on September 21.

Although, if you've read our cover story about the game, you already know this, and you also know you can play the game with up to three friends on a shared living server.\nWhat's more, Korol says the game will feature \"a rich Offline Mode\" for those not interested in the game's multiplayer elements.\n\n\nKorol announced this today on X (formerly Twitter), expanding on Moon's thoughts about No Rest for the Wicked as both a single-player and multiplayer game. \n\"Even though Wicked was built from the ground up with multiplayer in mind, we did not want offline-play to feel like a second thought and we want people to be able to play on the go when connection quality is not always ideal,\" Korol writes. \"Our April 18th [Early Access launch on PC] will focus on the single player experience and we will be sharing more details about the Multiplayer aspect of the game later in our Early Access campaign.\" \n\n\nGame Informer has played hours of No Rest for the Wicked, so far only in single-player, and it's been a blast. You can read our preview thoughts on the game's opening hours here, and you can watch it for yourself in our No Rest for the Wicked New Gameplay Today.\nRead about No Rest for the Wicked's early access roadmap and Cerim's Crucible endgame content after that, and for even more exclusive content, head to Game Informer's No Rest for the Wicked coverage hub. \nAre you going to play No Rest for the Wicked with friends or alone?

          "description": "MultiVersus, the Warner Bros. free-to-play crossover platform fighter, makes its big comeback on May 28. The game has been rebuilt and returns almost a year after its open beta was taken offline.\nPlayer First Games game director Tony Huynh explains in a developer diary that MultiVersus has been remade from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5, meaning it sports improved visuals and lighting. It also has a totally revamped netcode to provide what Huynh promises will be consistent online performance regardless of platform.\nEvery existing fighter sports new attacks and combat mechanics, and Huynh promises that new fighters are on the way. Additionally, new stages were teased with concept art depicting arenas based on The Powerpuff Girls’ Townsville and Dexter’s Laboratory.\nLastly, Huynh reveals a brand-new PvE mode is coming to the game. He doesn’t go into detail, only teasing it will offer “additional ways of playing with unique rewards.” \n\n\nMultiVersus was first launched in open beta last May and pits characters across Warner Bros. stable of IPs, such as DC, Looney Tunes, and even Game of Thrones, in a tag-team-focused twist of Super Smash Bros. inspired combat. The game was initially quite popular and generally well-liked. Writer Bryan Vore gave the game’s beta incarnation an 8 out of 10 in our review, writing that “Living games have the potential to go in frustrating directions, but MultiVersus has a strong foundation. If it can meaningfully roll out content and smooth out its rough edges, this could become a new crossover obsession for years to come.” \nUnfortunately, months of infrequent updates and lack of communication following the game’s second season saw engagement decline. Player First Games pulled MultiVersus from stores to address these criticisms. When the game returns, it will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.\nAre you looking forward to jumping back into the new and improved MultiVersus?

Movie, Nintendo and Illumination have announced that work has begun on a second movie set in the world of Super Mario Bros. The announcement, made by Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto and Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri, states that this film will arrive in theaters in the United States on April 3, 2026.\nWhile the announcement stops short of calling this \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" or even referring to it as a sequel, Miyamoto confirms that Nintendo and Illumination are working together on this one, and the director duo of the first film, Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, are returning. \"As for the details of the new movie, as I often say, we'll let you know once we're at the stage where we're ready to share more,\" Miyamoto said in the announcement video posted on Nintendo of America's YouTube channel. \"This time, we're thinking about broadening Mario's world further and it'll have a bright and fun story. We hope you'll look forward to it!\"\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie stars Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Day, Jack Black, Keegan-Michael Key, and Seth Rogen. Nintendo and Illumination have yet to confirm any of the cast of this new film set in the Super Mario Bros. world. The Super Mario Bros. Movie arrived in theaters on April 5, 2023 to positive fan and critic reception, and earned a place among the highest-grossing films of all time. The new film set in this same world is set to arrive almost exactly three years later on April 3, 2026.\nWhat do you want to see from a new Super Mario Bros. animated movie?

          "description": "After The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reinvented the series in 3D and became its new gold standard, Nintendo followed up with a surreal sequel in Majora's Mask. Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days. Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.\nJoin Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

However, a few months after the game's June release during The Game Awards 2023, Square Enix revealed FFXVI would be getting two DLCs. \nThe first – Echoes of the Fallen – was a combat-centric DLC released that same night. The second – The Rising Tide – is a more expansive, story-focused DLC about the Leviathan Eikon curiously missing from the main game. While we still don't know when to expect The Rising Tide other than this spring, I spoke to Yoshida and DLC director Takeo Kujiraoka about what players can expect and more, and you can read about that in my preview here. \n\n\nI also asked the d…",

He was 68.\nThe news was broken early this morning in a public letter by Toriyama's manga studio, Bird Studio. Bird revealed in a letter posted on the official Dragon Ball X account that Toriyama died on March 1 of acute subdural hematoma. A private funeral service was held, and the studio has asked fans to respect the privacy of Toriyama's family. You can read the full letter below.\nInformation ; Dear Friends and Partnershttps://t.co/85dXseckzJ pic.twitter.com/aHlx8CGA2M\nMarch 8, 2024\nAkira Toriyama was born in 1955 and became a manga artist at 23. Primarily known for his works in Weekly Shōnen Jump for works such as Dr. Slump, his biggest claim to fame would be Dragon Ball. First published in 1983, Dragon Ball would explode into a cultural phenomenon, spawning a massively popular multimedia franchise with multiple manga volumes, a successful long-running anime, several films, and a litany of merchandise. Dragon Ball has become one of the most influential mangas of all time and would also become a massive fixture in video games, with dozens of titles across a variety of platforms. \nUpcoming games based on Toryiama’s work include Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero, the next entry in the Budakai Tenkaichi series, and Sand Land, an action RPG launching on April 26 based on his 2000 manga. \nToryiama would also lend his distinct art style to video games such as the Dragon Quest series, Chrono Trigger, and Blue Dragon. Six years ago, Game Informer editors current and former got together to talk about Toriyama's influence on the game industry. You can watch that video here.\nGame Informer extends its condolences to Toriyama’s family and loved ones.",

This new Warbond is packed with \"high-voltage vibes,\" giving players access to new loadout potential with ultra-futuristic armor, guns that spit lightning, stylish capes, emotes, and more. \nWarbond – Cutting Edge goes live next week on March 14 and brings with it a new \"Acquisitions\" battle pass of things to unlock. However, don't fret if you're still working through the first free and premium Warbonds in Helldivers 2 – Warbonds don't expire. \nCheck out the Helldivers 2 Warbond – Cutting Edge trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nWithin this new Warbond, players will find multiple EX Series armor prototypes. The EX-03 Prototype 3 includes a rubber underlayer for insulation with \"wires that operate at a shocking 400,000 volts.\" The EX-16 Prototype 16 has an electric arc that generates a strong magnetic field. The EX-00 Prototype X is the \"end result of several billion Super Credits and 12 years of research into creating 'the Soldier of Tomorrow.'\"\nIn terms of new weapons, expect electricity. The LAS-16 is a laser rifle that fires in short bursts, and it doesn't need reloading either (just watch for overheating). The SG-8P Punisher Plasma is a modified Punisher shotgun that uses plasma rounds, and the ARC-12 Blitzer projects an arc of close-range lightning. Or, you can charge it up to fire powerful bolts good for taking out multiple targets. \nYou can also unlock the new G-23 Stun grenade and the LAS-7 Dagger pistol, too. \n\nElsewhere in this Warbond, Helldivers will find matching player cards for each cape and three new emotes. \nCutting Edge rolls out to Destroyer Acquisition panels on March 14. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Helldivers 2 review, and then read about the latest patch that added meteor showers and fire tornadoes to the war. \nAre you excited for Warbond – Cutting Edge in Helldivers 2?

          "description": "For the 17th time, ScummVM has again been accepted for the Google Summer of Code program this summer.\nThe program intends to bring new contributors into open source projects. In the most recent two years this has included both students and non-students as eligible candidates for participation.\nLike last year, participants can apply for working on either short tasks (about 175 hours of work), or large tasks (about 350 hours of work). The coding period typically runs from start of June through August, but there is some flexibility which allows participants to have longer time frames if they are unable to work full time through the summer.\nScummVM is looking for people interested in participating in GSoC with us. A list of suggested projects can be found on this page, but we are also open to your own ideas as well. Please provide the required information in your application before submitting.\nWe also strongly encourage you to join our Discord server, in the #scummvm-gsoc channel. This allows you to engage with our mentors and the rest of the team, to get advice about how to get involved with the project, as well as writing your application.\nBased on our previous 16 years of experience with GSoC, we have put together a Google Summer of Code miniportal to help you get started.\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\n>",

Exactly 21 years ago, I received an ICQ message (look it up, kids) out of the blue from a guy named Ludvig Strigeus (nicknamed Ludde). “Hello, you probably don’t know me, but I’ve been working on a project to clone TTD for a while.” he said, more or less. He didn’t want to release this to the public yet, and wasn’t entirely sure what he was going to do with it. (He’d been working on it since 30th June 2002, so I guess that is technically the birthday of what would become OpenTTD…) Ludde sent me a copy of what he’d been working on, and it was very exciting indeed. It was a fully functional version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, written in C. Admittedly incomplete at that time, it was still quite remarkable.",
