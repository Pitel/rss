          "description": "Lite and dark.\nChernobylite launched back in 2019, bringing with it mostly positive reviews and an interesting hook for a 3D survival game laced with a touch of horror – it was made using 3D scans of the real-life Chernobyl exclusion zone. This hints at an intriguing attention to detail from the developers, and on more powerful hardware, the effort pays off, providing the game with an immersive atmosphere full of misty lighting and tangibly tragic ruins. But on Switch, the impact of the game’s most unique feature has, unfortunately, been lost in the visual downgrade.\nBy far the strongest part of Chernobylite for us was its ambitious storytelling. The storyline follows Igor Khymynuk, whose aim — to find his wife Tatyana, another scientist, who went missing in the zone — is compellingly brought to life as he hallucinates through missions and struggles to put together clues and launch a climactic assault on the Chernobyl facility itself, Tatyana’s last-known location.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Even a very serious game of snooker, in which people wear waistcoats, is 'just a game' on some level. But of course video games can be very different, and Pine is one such game. The subtitle gives it away – A Story of Loss – and it does exactly what it says on the tin.\nYou might be inclined to imagine something like Arise: A Simple Story, where some light platforming guides you through allegorical landscapes in between cutscenes. However, Pine could be politely described as 'gameplay-light'. The protagonist is an unnamed man living alone in a forest clearing. He fells trees for firewood, grows vegetables in a small allotment to feed himself, and does little else besides carving little statuettes of a woman he loves but has lost.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "A master thief creeps over cobbles in an early modern metropolis that splits the difference between Edinburgh, Glasgow and Liverpool. Lit by gaslamps that can’t quite dispel the industrial haze, they pass for a civilian - a rough one, admittedly, but not shady enough to cause an itch in the swordarm of any passing guard.\nUntil, that is, they take to the thieves’ highway - following the trajectory of their grappling hook upward to the rooftops, from which they can see the shape of the city, and the moon beyond. Up here, it’s a parallel world - the trees on street level answered by chimney stacks, and the distant hills echoed by the rise and fall of steep gables. “We’re super proud of these rooftops,” says Greg LoPiccolo. “It’s an amazing landscape that we put a lot of thought and effort into, and it’s a lot of fun to traverse.”\nBack in 1998, LoPiccolo was the game director who saw Thief: The Dark Project to completion. Today - after an 18 year detour to Harmonix to lead projects like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, among other adventures - he’s the game director of Thick as Thieves. “It really is an opportunity to do something unique and cool and new, on the shoulders of this stuff that is now well-respected,” he says. “Thief has some legs, right? People still talk about it to some degree.”\nRead more",

Fights are like if you took a MOBA and forced both teams to bash heads constantly. Success lies in picking off Spider-Man or Squirrel Girl or Marcus Fenix so as they wait to respawn, you hop on the big area that needs capturing. Or you push the cart while tanky Hulk absorbs bullets with his biceps and John Marvel snipes from afar.\nThe more I played Rivals, though, the more it hit me that it's specifically a messier, more complex Overwatch. A hero shooter with a surprising amount of polish and charm, sure, but also one that slides off my brain like water off Birdman's back. I understand why it's supremely popular at the moment and yet, I really don't.\nRead more",

          "description": "In more ways than one, today’s Total War: Warhammer 3 expansion marks a milestone for game director Rich Aldridge and his team at Creative Assembly. Omens Of Destruction’s three headline legendary lords each bring new campaigns and units for their respective factions, but it’s the fourth lord - a Khorne champion free to all players - that I imagine Aldridge will end up remembering the most fondly.\nWhen Total War: Warhammer released back in 2016, it shipped with eight legendary lords - famous characters from Games Workshop’s fantasy setting that here act as faction leaders. The number grew steadily and, in terms of announcement order at least, today’s addition of Arbaal The Undefeated marks the series’ 100th. That's a hundred campaigns, a hundred joint efforts of game design, animation, art, writing and voice work.\nAldridge has never been shy about the team’s ambition for the series to eventually offer up each unit from every Fantasy Battle 6th edition army book (\"The goal is to do everything, right?\"). But ambition is one thing, and considering the fraught conditions at Creative Assembly and parent company Sega over the past few years, it’s not just the addition of the 100th lord that feels like something to celebrate. It’s taken time, effort, and a siesmic shift in update frequency, but Total War: Warhammer III is in the best place it's ever been.\nRead more",

For most of us, Steam simply slurps down fresh gigs of installed games automatically when a new update is released (and sometimes schedules the updates according to its own capricious whims). But the platform is testing a new option in the beta client, which lets you set download behaviour to git new gigs only when you actually launch a game. This would be a terrible curse, for reasons I will explain, but it's only going to be an option - not the new default.\nRead more",

These minimalist or slight experiences set their stall against the mainstream philosophy of video game design focused on action, rules, clear progression, and often violence. So it is with Naiad, a sometimes pleasant swim down a river in which you sing to make flowers grow and discover poems by interacting with birds, bees, butterflies and other fauna. \r\n\nYet here's the cause of my pity. All those other games, with their decisive action, systemic consequence, and neck-snapping: I was playing those to relax, too. Why else would I have snapped all those necks? Being shorn of base pleasures does not make Naiad a restorative oasis amid a desert of stressful video games, and it doesn't make it more relaxing than its peers. In fact, it makes for an experience that left me restless, even a little anxious, when it made me feel anything at all.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's currently fourth on the Steam daily most played, right between Path Of Exile 2 and the evergreen Grand Theft Auto 5. I think there are three reasons for this enthusiasm: 1) it's free-to-play with the usual comet's tail of microtransactables 2) it's third-person Overwatch with Marvel characters, a straightforwardly enticing licensing sandwich, and 3) people want to have sex with a larger-than-usual proportion of the cast and especially awful tongue-monster Venom, who has a good butt in this one. No, I'm not going to share pictures. You'll have to google that filth yourself.\r\n\n\r\nBut perhaps you are a sophisticated soul who has no time for such salacious nonsense. You're more interested in hearing how they're patching the thing. Enough with the butts already, dang it - this is a new multiplayer game so there must, of course, be patches!

It's like offering somebody a cake that is actually a cunningly painted hunk of torpedo fuselage. It's like offering to shake hands while wearing one of those comedy hand buzzers - except that the hand buzzer is an intricate simulation of zero-G physics, missile behaviours and comms jamming, featuring spacecraft with proper internal layouts that require you to think hard about attitude control if you don't want, say, your engines to become Swiss cheese about 90 seconds before you need to retreat from combat. \r\n\n\r\nBeing a \"true\" 3D real-time space strategy game, Nebulous looks and sounds a lot like Homeworld on the surface, but it's nothing like as straightforward. It is systems within systems. It is a game in which you can, theoretically, plot the path of a single guided munition through an asteroid field, so as to catch an enemy cruiser in the back. I barely understand how to make a ship fire on another ship, using plain old armour-piercing shells, and now they're threatening to add carriers, fighters and bombers. Customisable ones!

Descending into Gatwick’s cloying brown from 33,000 feet is like flying under and up Gandalf’s wretched cloak and landing in one of the several horrible little magic pouches he keeps by his balls.\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator 2024 captures Gatwick’s brown perfectly. Next to the stupefying natural beauty of Yosemite, the imposing imperial skyscrapers of the Manhattan skyline and the surging majesty of the Alpine peaks, this local rot-tinged patch of West Sussex is the most impressively realistic depiction of a place I have seen in a game.\nRead more",

          "description": "It's not just because he's a Nazi. It's because he's a smartass Nazi. As the main antagonist in Indiana Jones And The Great Circle, Emmerich Voss vacates the archetypal armchair usually reserved for secondary fascist goons, so that he can goosestep straight into the big boy seat himself. He smiles with all the sleaze of right-hand-man Major Toht, the grubby gestapo who gets that right hand burned in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Yet he also engages in the pseudo-intellectual trash talk of the main archaeological rivals to Jones, like Rene Belloq or Walter Donovan. He is a hideous grab bag of all the things that make an instantly detestable villain in the series. But there's something else. Voss is so immediately and gutturally hateable because he resembles a type of racist encountered not in the 1930s, but one you've probably met today: the asshole you meet on the internet.\nWarning: Here be spoilers.\nRead more",

          "description": "The only sound that greets you upon booting up Eclipsium is a loudly throbbing heart. As one must when encountering horror media, the game and I immediately enter a spiritual staring contest, each of us knowing the real game here was it trying to freak me out. \"It’s fine\", I decided. \"It’s just a heart! I’ve got a heart. It’s actually very useful. Nothing to be scared of\". Thing is, Eclipsium’s menu heart is actually massive and sits, like The Eye Of Sauron, atop a giant obelisk. “Ah. That’s definitely a horror thing, that” I was forced to admit. \"If my heart was on a giant obelisk, I’d be proper shaken up, I reckon.\"\nSo starts Eclipsium’s very first bit of aggressive disorientation, and it basically just escalates from there. I obviously can’t describe the vibes without slightly spoiling the vibes, so do pop over to Steam for a demo if you’re curious and, oh, there’s a potted plant, the sound of its rustling mixed in such a way that it sort of sounds like it’s shrieking at me.

It’s a great feeling to begin your week identifying an archetype of diminutive magician, and I hope it becomes a regular occurrence. Another pleasant  discovery was Oolo itself, which you can discover yourself through the shrouded magic of this link to it’s free demo.\n(Do I need to keep writing ‘free demo’, by the way?

Both (the best Final Fantasy game) Final Fantasy 8’s Squall and The Witcher 3’s Geralt simply cannot get enough of leaving their friends and the entire world in mortal peril while they sneak in a quick round of cards, and I love them for it. Way back when the Wild Hunt released, there was a special edition kicking about that gave you a few decks for Gwent - the fleshed-out, playable card distraction that ended up being responsible for some of the game’s best moments. I pined for those decks, but I never acquired them. Now, Hatchette Board Games is putting out a full physical edition of Gwent next year.\nThe set contains \"over 400 cards and a playmat\" for £44/$39.99. I’m still recovering from various Fantasy Flight LCGs, so my value sense for this stuff might be a bit skewed, but that strikes me as incredibly reasonable. A good Gwent deck consists of only about 25 cards. They’re not bad cards, either! I’ve got a real pet hate for tabletop versions of videogames that just use in-engine screenshots for the cards, but these ones look to have the proper artwork from the game on them:\nRead more",

And talking of stealing things and having a good time doing it, it’s also releasing on the Nintendo Switch soon, which means the Steam version of Doronko Wanko is getting some free DLC to celebrate.

          "description": "When last we left myself, on a mission to survive S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 by weaponising its monsters instead of shooting its guns, my one-with-nature experiment was yielding mixed results. At best. I’d successfully lured some bandits into the deadly lair of a bucket-tossing Poltergeist, but several attempts at more actively siccing mutated pigs on the Zone’s human baddies had all failed, even when I’d seemed to actually tame one.\nNow, my only friend lay dead at my feet, and I’m in dire need of some new beasts to master. And some cash. It turns out that a fighting style that involves letting shopping trolley-sized swine creatures chew on my heels is bad for the ol’ HP, and having recently blown my savings on half a sausage, I’m forced to shift focus from my current debt collection mission towards a means to fill my own coffers.\nRead more",

          "description": "I think It’s safe to say that Trigger Happy Interactive’s upcoming survival horror Total Chaos is a bit of a palette change from their last offering - the frenetic, neon-drenched, chainsaw-legged Turbo Overkill. Still, it’s not often we see psychological horror combined with ultraviolence, and anything that gives off even a whiff of Condemned: Criminal Origins has my attention.\nTotal Chaos started life as a popular Doom 2 mod, and while I dare the say the limitations of that game sell the atmosphere a little better than this much sleeker update, I certainly trust Trigger Happy enough to make the most of the new engine. The game is set in New Oasis, a “once bustling haven for coal miners” that is now most definitely not bustling, nor haven-like.\nRead more",

The Thing: Remastered is an ultra-sharp and commendably playable update to a game that history will remember as ‘actually a pretty good pick at Choices when you really just popped in to get some Revels but got embarrassed when the till staffer said “is that everything?” in a tone that could have been neutral but equally could have been a damning indictment of your character’.\nI’m being slightly facetious here, of course. History actually remembers Computer Artworks’s 2002 shooty horror game for how incredibly ambitious and conceptually inventive its proto-sus social squad system was. In homage to the body-snatching alien paranoia of Carpenter’s 1982 horror classic, The Thing tasks you with not just assembling and directing a squad, but keeping them from breaking down or turning on you - in fear you might be hosting the titular molecular stowaway.\nRead more",

You'll get a Prime Electrum Players Pack, and a 1,000 coin boost for 5 games. \n\n\nOver the course of the last three matchdays, the community was able to decipher the mystery nation before it was officially revealed on the stream. So far, we have had a varied list covering different continents in the form of Colombia, Croatia, and Cameroon. \n\n\nThere's a strong chance that the mystery nation might be from North America or Oceania, but it's best to wait for the official reveal.

          "description": "If you're a Final Fantasy 14 player who has been hoping for a nice Christmas present, the Snowstreamer mount can be unlocked as part of the new Twitch Support-A-Streamer Campaign event.\n\n\nThis is a really unique opportunity for both the players and those who stream the game, and it's part of Twitch's partnership with the game. Its launch coincides with the Starlight Celebration event, and there's never been a better time to watch the gameplay content on Twitch. Let's take a look at how you can unlock this unique mount and how long it will be available.\n\n\nHow to get the Snowstreamer mount in Final Fantasy 14\n\n\nFor starters, you'll need a Twitch account, so go and create one (or login to your existing account). Next, start watching a Twitch Partnered streamer or one affiliated with the game. If you don't have anyone in mind, just search using 'Final Fantasy XIV Online'.\n\n\nOnce you start watching the streams, the next task is to gift three subscriptions of any tier to the subscribers. The cheapest option is to go for a Tier One subscription, and yes, the mount isn't technically available for free.\n\n\nThere are some freedoms - you don't have to buy and gift the three subscriptions all at once. The subscriptions can also be of different tiers. Just make sure that the purchase and gifting take place till the Twitch Support-A-Streamer Campaign Event is live. Otherwise, it won't count. The event is available till December 31, 2024, and a code will be available in your inbox once you've sent all three gifts.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you've got the code, log in to your Final Fantasy 14 Mog Station website with your Square Enix account. Make sure that it's tied with your main in-game account in case you have multiple ones before redeeming the code. Once redeemed, you'll get the rewards via the Moogle Mail in the game. If you find it missing, make sure to restart the game once.\n\nThe post How to unlock the Snowstreamer Mount in Final Fantasy 14 (Twitch Support-A-Streamer Campaign Event) appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Black Ops 6 players are encountering a new 2901 error when they enter matchmaking. This error pops up “Lobby not found,” especially if you are an Xbox Game Pass user. This error usually pops up when there’s a problem with connecting to the game servers or something on your end isn’t working right. \n\n\nLuckily, there are a few things you can try to fix things and get back into the game. Here are all the possible fixes for the lobby not found error in Black Ops 6.\n\n\nAll possible fixes for Black Ops 6 lobby not found error (2901)\n\n\nTurn on the crossplay from the settings\n\n\nImage via Activision\n\n\nIf you are a console user, then you should definitely turn on the crossplay so that you can match up with more users in the game. By default, it is on, but if you have turned it off, then you should consider turning it back on. In case you don’t know where the crossplay settings are, here are the steps for it:\n\n\n\nStep 1: Open the Black Ops 6.\n\n\nStep 2: Now open the menu and head to the settings.\n\n\nStep 3: Once the settings are opened, go to Accounts & Network and there you can find the crossplay settings.\n\n\n\nRestart the game\n\n\nI know it sounds basic, but you can restart the game as it can sometimes clear up any temporary issues causing the error.\n\n\nUpdate the game\n\n\nMake sure that you have installed the latest patch. Sometimes this error happens if you are running an outdated version of the game.\n\n\nReinstall the game\n\n\nIf none of the above fixes work, then you should reinstall the game. It is a last resort, but it may fix any deeper issues with corrupted files. However, I would recommend waiting for a developer announcement regarding this error.\n\nThe post Black Ops 6 lobby not found error (2901): All possible fixes appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Precision is a key factor when taking the field in Marvel Rivals, as one misclick can lead to your — and in the worst-case scenario — your team's demise. But what can you do when, unfortunately for many players, one default setting seems to be making that a common occurrence? Here's how to turn off mouse acceleration in Marvel Rivals, as well as what exactly the setting does.\n\n\nHow to turn off mouse acceleration in Marvel Rivals\n\n\nAs there's currently no way to turn off the setting from within the game, the only sure way to turn off mouse acceleration in Marvel Rivals requires you to head straight to its files. You can do that by first heading to AppData\\Local\\Marvel. Once there, head to Safe, Config, and then to Windows before doing the following:\n\n\n\nSelect GameUserSettings\n\n\nOpen the file\n\n\nAdd the following lines to the file as shown below. Make sure to add them at the end to avoid any disruptions.\n\n[/script/engine.inputsettings]\n\n\nbEnableMouseSmoothing=False\n\n\nbViewAccelerationEnabled=False\n\n\n\n\nClose the file after making sure your changes are saved and then boot Marvel Rivals.\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that although disabling the feature has yet to be pinpointed as the main cause for any ban, the way you cannot do so in-game can open you up for it. So make sure to take your time if you are not 100% sure.\n\n\nHow Does Mouse Acceleration Work?\n\n\nTrue to its name, Mouse Acceleration is a feature present in most modern games that boosts the range in which your cursor will move based on the speed at which you move your mouse. That can then lead to a huge decrease in precision, especially when in high-stakes situations, where having the same movement yield different results is never a good thing.\n\n\nNow that you know how to disable mouse acceleration in Marvel Rivals, I also highly recommend checking out the best settings for max FPS in the game, so that you can further tune in your experience as you climb the ranks.\n\nThe post How to turn off mouse acceleration in Marvel Rivals appeared first on Destructoid.",

This includes three different types of belts that can be unlocked and used in combat. Out of the three, the White Belt is certainly one of the easier ones to get, but it can be immensely helpful in terms of stat buffs.\n\n\nHow to obtain the White Belt in Blox Fruits\n\n\nObtaining the White Belt is relatively easy, but there are some prerequisites. You'll need to be 1575 or above, as you'll need to reach the Dragon Dojo in Hydra Island. Once you've reached there, speak with the Dojo Trainer to pick up the White Dojo Belt quest. You'll also need to have 500 Dragon Talon Mastery.\n\n\nObtaining the Dragon Talon can be slightly time-consuming since you'll first need to get the Dragon Breath fighting style from Sabi for 1,500 fragments. Once you've achieved 400 Mastery on it, you will need Fire Essence, Beli, and Fragments.\n\n\nAfter you have all the resources in the required amounts, Dragon Talon can be learned from Uzoth. Once learned, the next task is to use it in different quests to get the required Mastery points. Then, you'll have to complete the White Dojo Belt quest.\n\n\n\n\nTo finish the quest, you'll have to defeat 20 Serpent Hunters that can be found on Hydra Island. After getting the required eliminations, go back to the trainer to complete the quest and earn your White Belt. This belt provides a double boost: 2% Melee damage and +10% Movement Speed.\n\n\nCompleting the belt quest also gets you a Rare Scroll as an additional reward. Overall, it's a pretty simple task if you're already at a decent power level on your character. There are two additional belts available in Blox Fruits apart from White that you can obtain to get more boosts. \n\nThe post How to get the white belt in Blox Fruits appeared first on Destructoid.",

With Bungie reducing the importance of weapon crafting and doubling down on the Power grind, the community is slowly growing more and more tired of how the studio is handling the game.\n\n\nSpecifically, we've now had not one but two huge Reddit threads where a Destiny 2 player going under the name of Techman- went deep into discussing what's going on with Bungie's flagship project. Their assessment? That Bungie is slowly but steadily dismantling the legacy of Destiny 2's former Game Director, Joe Blackburn.

Even if they're genuinely trying to lighten the mode with some jokes, they can distract you with their commentary.\n\n\nMarvel Rivals allows you to silence players who clog up the voice chat, but it doesn't come out and tell you how. Here's how to mute other players in Marvel Rivals.\n\n\nHow to mute other players on PC in Marvel Rivals\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nIf you've reached the point where you're looking to mute a fellow player in Marvel Rivals, you'll have to wait until you've entered a match. Once the game starts, click the P key to open the match setting menu. You should see a list of every player in the game, with your team on the left side and the enemy team on the right.\n\n\nYou'll see a long list of icons next to each player's name. To mute a player, click the microphone icon next to their name. This should prevent you from hearing them in the voice chat, but it won't keep their comments from appearing in the text chat. If you want to keep yourself from seeing another player's text, click the speech box icon next to their name.\n\n\nHow to mute other players on consoles in Marvel Rivals\n\n\nIf you're playing Marvel Rivals on consoles, you can mute other players by following similar steps. Once you're in a match, hit the start button. This should open a drop-down menu full of options. Select the \"Settings\" menu, and you'll find the same lists of players that PC players see when they hit the P key.\n\n\nOnce you're on the match settings page, click the microphone icon next to the player you want to mute's name.

K písničkám z alba vyšly animované videoklipy, které produkoval Leidži Macumoto, což byl kultovní japonský výtvarník (zemřel loni), který měl na svém kontě mnoho animovaných seriálů, především ze 70. - 80. let (nejslavnější z nich byl asi \"Space Battleship Yamato\"). Daft Punk ho oslovili proto, že na jeho seriálech vyrůstali, takže výsledné dílo, včetně \"jednodušší\" retro animace a naivní zápletky zcela záměrně připomíná staré japonské televizní počiny (n…",
