          "description": "White plains.\nThe notion of two disparate species of animals coming together to help one another is not particularly new in the world of storytelling. The trope goes all the way back to the likes of Peter Rabbit, in which our intrepid titular hero enlists the assistance of Squirrel Nutkin to help fend off the dastardly fox, Mr. Tod. It’s a concept that just works and is immediately endearing to both children and adults; so it’s no wonder, then, that Blanc resonated with so many upon its initial reveal. But does the actual gameplay hold up? Mostly, but with some important caveats.\nBlanc stars two playable characters - a wolf cub and a fawn - both of whom have been inadvertently cut off from their respective families during a sudden snowstorm. As the two try to get their bearings, they run into each other over two sides of a frozen river, and ultimately decide to help each other return to their parents and siblings. Considering there’s absolutely no dialogue in Blanc, developer Casus Ludi has done a remarkable job in communicating exactly what’s going on with the two main characters in question, despite the admittedly simplistic plot.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Well, how about some more detailed analysis on Retro Studios and Iron Galaxy's stellar rerelease from the team over at Digital Foundry?\nComparing the new Switch release to both the GameCube and Wii titles, Digital Foundry has given the game a pretty glowing overview, while also pointing out a few minor quibbles. And we really do mean minor. The game runs at a consistent 60fps according to Digital Foundry's tests in both handheld and docked, no matter how chaotic the screen gets, while resolution is at 900p on the big screen and 600p on a Switch screen. But it looks stunning on an OLED, all thanks to the game's improved lighting.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "\"I'm really bad at falling-block puzzle games\".\nMasahiro Sakurai continues to share insights into his storied history in the video game industry along with game design tips and his own philosophy. And today, the creator of the Super Smash Bros. series has pulled back the curtain on one of his first major projects after going freelance — the 2005 DS puzzle game Meteos.\nWhile working as a supervisor and doing consulting work on various video games, Sakurai was approached by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, a developer who formerly worked at Sega. Mizuguchi wanted Sakurai to make a falling-block puzzle game. Amusingly, Sakurai admits that he's \"really bad at falling-block puzzle games\", especially Puyo-Puyo (though he did supervision work on Kirby's Avalanche, a Puyo-Puyo-inspired Kirby puzzle game), but says that working on a new genre was a \"fascinating challenge\".\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "\"What's yer name and where d'ya come from?\".\nLooking back on Wales Interactive’s Five Dates in 2023, more than two years after its debut, reveals a fascinating glimpse into what life was like during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s a game that leans heavily into the idea that the dating world has migrated online, forcing singletons to conduct awkward interview-style conversations with potential suitors. We certainly enjoyed it for what it was back in 2020, but we’d perhaps argue that it’s aged better as a sort of historical artefact; a brief portal into a world that most of us would quite happily forget.\nIts sequel, Ten Dates, isn’t afforded the same novelty. While the pandemic marches on across the globe, many countries have taken to treating the virus as endemic, thus returning to some semblance of normality (whatever that looks like these days). With this in mind, Ten Dates is very much a traditional affair; a game that puts its focus squarely on face-to-face interactions within typical social settings. It’s undoubtedly missing the “novelty” of remote interactions that made the first game so unique, but the focus on real-life conversations makes for a more enjoyable experience all round.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Yes, they're cheap per gigabyte, yes they're fairly reliable, yes they're absolutely the way to go if you need to store a lot of data and don't care how long it takes to access it. But. But. These drives are hard to go back to after you're used to SSDs, with their near-instant access times, completely silent operation, resistance to shocks, drops and magnets and of course their overall SPEED. \nSo when I had the chance, I bought the biggest SSD I could afford, a 4TB model at the time, and copied literally every bit of data from the four or five 1TB or smaller hard drives that I'd bought over the years and stuck into my increasingly full PC tower. It was expensive, and it took ages to copy everything across, but as soon as I turned my computer on for the first time and I didn't have to listen to the clicks and whirs of a mechanical drive, I was completely convinced I'd made the right call to ditch spinning rust.  \nRead more",

In fairness, though, co-op adventure Blanc looks like it's going to be a lot lighter than games like Endling: Extinction is Forever and the notoriously upsetting Shelter series at first glance, but I’ve learned to never let my guard down around these kinds of games. Those cute art styles are almost always a front for a brutal sneak attack on your emotions.\nBlanc is very much aiming for your heartstrings with its adorable animal duo and picturesque snowy landscapes. The first half teases massive potential for a cutesy story with fun puzzle antics, but the game is majorly let down by a repetitive and often frustrating second half and lacklustre ending. After the promise of a warm, cosy adventure, I watched the end credits roll and couldn't help feeling like I'd been left out in the cold.\nRead more",

And I'm guessing it wants players to experience the joys of shredding goons, and a story told through unpredictable cuts to karaoke and anime. I'm sad to report that it isn't any of these things. Aside from the tiniest glimpses of cool when a combo comes together, the game clearly doesn't know what it wants to be, or if it did once upon a time, its original vision must've gotten lost under a dogpile of ideas. I rooted for it when I first saw it way back when, and got excited when I heard it was being made by devs behind Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive, but what's arrived is a jumbled mess that fights you at every turn. If I were Debra Meadon playing it for the first time live on Dragon's Den, and someone sidled up behind me and pressed a katana to my throat, I would still carefully put the controller down and say, \"It's a no from me\".\nRead more",

And, since an Ordinary (non-magical person) suddenly getting magic is also deemed weird in Ikenfell, it stands to reason that it’s practically guaranteed to happen. We can only assume the odds become even higher as the Ordinary ventures closer to the big magical fantasy school, which protagonist Maritte quickly discovers. Upon approaching the gate in search of her missing sister, Safina, Maritte suddenly starts to sling fiery spells.\nThose new spells certainly come in handy, as Maritte finds herself fired up (hehe, geddit?) and ready to fight through this Paper Mario-style tactical RPG. Along with some of Saf’s old friends, you explore the titular school and surrounding areas, searching for clues that might help unravel the mystery. Ikenfell has challenging combat and lots of little secrets hidden in its 8-bit world, but it’s the loveable bunch of pals (both allies and rivals) that really made me smile. Oh, and some of them have killer theme tunes that I can’t stop singing.\nRead more",

          "description": "Too many spells in games are just variations on the old reliable fireball. Wizard sends projectile towards target. Target dies. Perhaps they deviate a little in how quickly they die, or how large the area of effect is. Maybe instead of a fireball it's a thunderbolt, or a poisonous gas, or a beam of light. Pish, I say. Pish! Where's the real magic? Where are the cataclysmic spells that take days or weeks of preparation, and then change the world with a single fateful ritual?\nThese games could learn something from The Last Spell, a roguelite turn-based tactics game about defending your village each night from hordes of mutant beasts that emerge from the purple fog surrounding the entire world. Whenever I start a new game in The Last Spell, I always rewatch the excellent opening sequence, which succinctly sets a harrowing scene of magic pushed further than we're used to seeing in most fiction in general, let alone games.\nRead more",

For six hours, you do this, and eat your dinner feeling sick with unrealised potential.\nMatch-3 games are compulsive for a reason, and I don't have beef with them as a concept. I actually like them! But I don't like that to play a match-3 game I usually have to play a mobile game that wants me to spent money on Fairy Dollars so I can buy barrels of Explosive Wand Dust, making it easier to earn stars and incrementally furnish the Magic Toilet Goblin's bedroom, or whatever. It's the empty consumerism vibe of freemium mobile games that makes me feel like I've been eating the time-spending equivalent of junk food. Spirit Swap, which has a demo out now in the form of an endless mode, isn't that. It's beautiful, difficult, customiseable, and it'll swallow you time in a good way, not a faintly unsettling one.\nRead more",

Curiously, you never combine two resources to produce a third, you can only upgrade minerals through a tier system. Higher tier resources are more potent, meaning, for exmaple, a building site will accept 100 raw minerals or four higher tier units. It’s a bit strange, but it mostly works. Double clicking on your starting buildings summons an interior view, where you lay out machinery, little modules for workers and storage, power pylons and so on.\nRead more",

When faced with a self-imposed task as massive and daunting as writing a retrospective on The Sims franchise, going back to the very first game was the obvious launchpad. The original The Sims — now sometimes called The Sims 1 for the sake of clarity — was released in February 2000, and received regular updates via expansion packs through to October 2003. The game was the brainchild of Will Wright, the designer behind the SimCity series, who had decided to approach the world of his popular city-building franchise from a new angle. Switching from macro- to micro-management, Wright's new spin-off project aimed to focus on the architectural design of individual houses. As time went on, his creative interests would shift again, to also take in the lives of the people inside the buildings.\nRead more",

Plus: the Dreadwolf is leeeeeaaakiiiiing.\nNate's mini-game this week is offering us both dark bargains (I think I did pretty well out of mine), and in a Good Day To Ware Hard James explains why the graphics card market is broken, with a cowboy metaphor. This is a thing now. \nRead more",

          "description": "A lot (most) of the magic games we're highlighting this week are in some manner lovely and nice, because witches these days tend towards the cottagecore (ily, Little Witch In The Woods!). It's nice that witches have changed in our minds to \"unmarried lady who lives alone and is good with herbs and cats :]\", when they used to be \"unmarried lady who lives alone and is good with herbs and her cat is the devil and she has sex with the devil\".\nThere's still room for witches with some threat to 'em, though, and I love a weird horror game, so you can imagine that when I heard about The Salt Order my interest was immediately piqued. It's a low-poly PS1-style game where an order of witches has tasked you with retrieving a grimoire from a cursed realm of endless trees. You are largely defenceless, except for the ability to draw on the ground with salt. \"In many stories that I knew as a child, salt was one of the very powerful magical protective elements against evil spirits,\" solo dev Khamelot tells me over email. \"During invocations, drawing a circle of salt could act as a basic protection. To prevent the spirits from entering one's home, you could put salt in front of the openings of the house.\"\nRead more",

Looking at both the popular upcoming demo list and the most wishlisted list, survival crafting game Voidtrain sits comfortably in second place on both. I decided to download the demo and see what the fuss was about, and wow, is Voidtrain completely wild.\nI thought Voidtrain might be relatively new, but it's actually been knocking around for a couple of years. It’s been in early access on the Epic Games Store since 2021, and after announcing a Steam release for October 2022, the game got indefinitely delayed. Voidtrain's Steam page currently has a vague release date of sometime in 2023, but the demo is a good reason enough to check it out while the team is still tightening some loose screws.\nRead more",

Except when you stick three of the same building type together, they all zhuup together to create an even bigger one. And a bigger one, and a bigger one. It's very satisfying. The smooshing lights up all the same parts of my brain that Threes did when I became obsessed with it about five years ago, while the tile planning hits scratches that big Dorfromantik itch, making for an excellent Steam Next Fest demo experience.  \nRead more",

Shampoo, bubble bath and toothpaste. Salad cream, yeast and lemonade. These concoctions were the result of pure genius, a brilliant mind capable of harmonising with ingredients on a sub-atomic level to create combinations that were beyond the capabilities of any known god. My Mam was only shouting at me because she didn’t understand. These were my elixirs! Sup from this bowl and taste the future of human evolution! Yes, I know this is the same bowl we’re also sick into when we’re not feeling well, but you also bake in it so let’s not start being picky. \r\n\n\r\nAs I got older, It became apparent my future was not in alchemy. Someone who puts baby corn into a bolognese clearly doesn't posses the skill to create balanced mixtures. And yet, Potionomics has wrenched the rotting corpse of that childhood fantasy right out of its grave. Finally, here is a suitable outlet for my feats of fantastical alchemy.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "It takes a particular type of farming game to really hook me in these days, but Lightyear Frontier's crop-planting mechs might just be the thing I've been looking for. Everything I've seen of Frame Break's futuristic life sim looks delightful so far, and in a recent ID@Xbox showcase, the developers told us a bit more about how it's going to operate, and whether those Stardew Valley comparisons are on the money. \nWhen asked whether players would be able to befriend NPCs like other Stardew-likes, Frame Break's CEO Joakim Hedström told us: \"In short, yes. We don't have a full town like Stardew, but the characters that are there, you'll be able to get to know better and learn their stories.\"\nRead more",

According to a report from The New York Times, Microsoft is expecting the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to oppose the deal, after EU regulators issued their own antitrust warnings last week.

Despite only being in early access, it's already got a solid foundation to work from. No, there isn't an Old Testament that whirls around your person like a holy sawblade, but there is a revolving shield with a pistol glued onto it. Yeah, I thought that would convince you.\nRead more",

This is entirely unlike Nintendo for a few reasons. Mostly, it’s because Metroid Prime Remastered isn’t just a port. They actually went to the effort of gussying up to the nines. Weirder yet, they aren’t charging some sort of premium for it or even full price. Sometimes they pretend that Metroid doesn’t even exist. Is this a mistake?\nIn any case, I love Metroid Prime.

This release — announced during last week's Nintendo Direct presentation — marks the official debut of the long-running franchise on the international stage for the first time since its 1994 inception.\neBaseball: Power Pros, officially recognized by The World Baseball Softball Confederation (WSBC) is a scaled-down version of the classic sport, featuring simple-to-learn controls, adorable chibi characters, and a huge roster of 300 characters. Form your team, take to the diamond, and become the most famous baseball team on the planet.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaS-0ZCbAYM&ab_channel=NintendoofAmerica\nAlternately, multiplayer support allows for up to four players to team up for online and offline action, battering up for some friendly competition, or entering online tournaments via the new Championship Mode. Wade through the statistics of the title's mammoth roster to ensure that you synergize the best pitchers, catchers, batters, and backstops in the business. For such a tiny title, WSBC eBaseball: Power Pros looks to have a pretty big personality.\nBest of all, it will cost interested parties very little to get in on the action.

          "description": "A new development in the controversy surrounding Mundfish\nMick Gordon, the composer for Mundfish’s upcoming FPS, Atomic Heart, has announced that he will be donating the fees her received for scoring the game to the Austrailian Red Cross' Ukraine Crisis Appeal for use in their humanitarian efforts in Ukraine.\n[embed]https://twitter.com/Mick_Gordon/status/1625495826247319556?s=20[/embed]\nThe announcement is significant as it comes following the concern that developer Mundfish is allegedly supported by investors with hands in Russia’s war in Ukraine; or that funds from Atomic Heart’s sales may directly help the Russian government. While Mundfish is based in Cyprus, there have been allegations that it's mainly headquartered in Moscow.\nMoreover, the studio allegedly has investors that have relations with Russian state-owned energy corporation Gazprom. While nothing has been directly proven, a lot of allegations have been brought up, and Mundfish hasn’t exactly stepped in to set the record straight itself, stating that it simply does “not comment on politics.”\nWhile Mick Gordon has not specifically commented on these accusations, this move is at least one that may help offset some of the concerns. However, it’s not the same as if Mundfish itself donated proceeds to aid Ukraine. I would encourage you to do your own research into Mundfish’s connection with the war in Ukraine, reach your own conclusions, and decide for yourself if purchasing Atomic Heart is reasonably moral for you.\nMick Gordon has scored titles such as Wolfenstein: The New Order, Killer Instinct, and Doom Eternal. Atomic Heart is available February 21 for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post Atomic Heart composer Mick Gordon to donate fees to Red Cross for Ukraine appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Deep End Games and 2124 Publishing has announced that Romancelvania, their unholy cross-breed of Metroidvania and dating sim, will be hitting the bedsheets March 7, 2023.\nRomancelvania introduces us to a Dracula whose confidence is still laid up after a savage beating at the hands of the Van Helsing clan. Their lover left them, their minions don’t respect them, and evil just doesn’t have the same appeal anymore. Death gets fed up with this pity party and sets Dracula up with their own dating show. It’s time to choose from 12 “lucky” singles and help the dark lord (or lady) get their mojo back. Peer pressure is the proven way to turn a spark into a flame.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/-iJkv94HlBA[/embed]\nGameplay is a clever combination of gated exploration and choice-driven dialogue. You’re given the option to choose a body type, and the dating options cover whatever it is you’re into, whether you’re more a Medusa or werewolf kind of person. The whole affair is fully voiced, which is an appreciated bit of extra effort.\nIt feels like simultaneously forever and not that long ago that I played the demo and came away impressed but skeptical. The whole concept seems like it will be extremely difficult to get right, given the amount of player agency available and the two disparate genres that are trying to be married. However, nothing about the demo implied that The Deep End Games is in over the depth, so provided the rest of the game matches the bar set by the earlier peek we got, then we’re in for a real treat.\nRomancelvania is out on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on March 7.\nThe post Romancelvania brings the vampire smooching March 7 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The stream will take place on March 9.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ2hZ-4JCTE&ab_channel=Nacon\nOriginally announced in the summer of 2021, RoboCop: Rogue City will see The Future of Law Enforcement laying down the Prime Directives in the city of Old Detroit. Fans are hoping that the title will capture the ridiculous violence and biting satire of Paul Verhoeven's fantastic 1987 movie. Actor Paul Weller is confirmed to be on board to provide his voice and likeness to the irreplaceable Alex Murphy.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYrJdAdi1WI&ab_channel=PlayStation\nThe Lord of the Rings: Gollum is an action-RPG that has unfortunately fallen into something of a development spiral, having been delayed several times since its initial announcement. Initially slated for launch in 2021 and then 2022, Daedalic Entertainment is yet to announce an official launch date for The Precious' arrival on PC and console platforms. Perhaps this Nacon Connect will finally mark the calendar with ink, giving LOTR fans something particularly intriguing to look forward to.\nIn addition to RoboCop: Rogue City and The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, the Nacon Connect will feature appearances from Robin Hood-themed multiplayer title Gangs of Sherwood, motorbike sim TT3: Ride on the Edge, psychological WWI horror Ad Infinitum, and fantasy roguelike Ravenswatch. We can also expect to see the latest from the publisher's line of gaming hardware and accessories, including headphones, microphones, and keyboards.\nYou can check out the stream over on the official Nacon YouTube channel on March 9, with the action scheduled to kick off at 10:00 PT / 13:00 ET / 18:00 BST.\nThe post We’ll see RoboCop: Rogue City at Nacon Connect next month appeared first on Destructoid.",

This figure, if correct, is believed to be around double the value of the previous deal between the two participants. The new contract will reportedly last for six years and will see EA retain its role as the lead partner of the Premier League, while also retaining its licensing for the use of 20 UK teams and their corresponding players.\nAs for FIFA itself, the group has previously suggested that it intends to launch its own football game franchise, and is currently seeking a developer for this as-yet-untitled new series. Ultimately, the long-running and incredibly popular \"FIFA\" experience lies with the talent of EA Sports, and while the transition period for EA Sports FC will be a little clunky, EA is expected to go above and beyond to ensure that its annual football releases remain a hugely lucrative part of its portfolio.\nPremier League closes in on £500m deal with EA Sports [Sky Sports / GamesIndustry.biz]\nThe post EA reportedly to sign £488 million Premier League deal for post-FIFA series appeared first on Destructoid.",

Today, Deep Silver and Dambuster Studios confirm that Dead Island 2 has gone gold, and will be launching a week earlier than previously determined.\nThis puts Dead Island 2 on April 21, 2023, rather than April 28. No specific reason was given in today's announcement.\nhttps://twitter.com/deadislandgame/status/1625147886643150852\nThis does push Dead Island 2 away from Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, which had also locked in an April 28 date. Both had moved to the end of April following delays, but now Dead Island 2 is shifting gears once more, now sharing a week with the return of Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp.\nMoving on up\nIt's a bit of a surprise to see a date moving up in the world of video games. Delays are usually more common, as teams need a few extra weeks to polish, tighten the screws, and put the final touches on a multi-year project. Still, we do see it from time-to-time. The gnarly Scorn moved its date up by a week last year, Martial arts brawler Sifu also bumped its date up a bit before launch, too.\nStill, for Dead Island 2, it's a bit of a surprise. First revealed at E3 2014, the zombified sequel has shambled through the years, eventually arriving at Dambuster Studios. The team there has finally got it together and ready to move out the door though, and it may be heartening for fans to see them so ready to hit the gas on the Dead Island sequel.\nWe'll find out whether Dead Island 2 and its motley crew of slayers can truly stick the landing a little bit earlier than expected. Dead Island 2 is now slated to launch on April 21, 2023 on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.\nThe post Dead Island 2 goes gold and moves its launch up a week appeared first on Destructoid.",

Movie — And this latest preview was a real treat for old-school Nintendo fans, as it featured the return of the \"Super Mario Bros. Rap\".\nFor folks younger than my aging self, the Super Mario Bros. Rap featured as the title music to the choppy (it was) animated series Super Mario. Bros Super Show, which originally aired way back in 1989. The show was famed for producing short, rubbish adventures, which were sandwiched between some wild, live-action bumper segments. These moments famously featured WWE star Captain Lou Albano as Mario and Canadian actor Danny Wells as Luigi. Once, Elvira showed up, though the Mistress of the Dark is yet to make her official Mario game debut. Sadness.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu57M7cjSD4&ab_channel=Illumination\nThe new Super Bowl ad features the rap as a backing track to a \"Real World\" advertisement for the Mario Bros. plumbing services, promoting their fast, speedy, and low-cost pipe repair. This then gives way to a new montage of clips from the upcoming movie, with a look at some fun and familiar platforming sections, a Smash Bros.-style showdown, and, of course, a ride down the Rainbow Road. The Super Mario Bros. Movie stars Chris Pratt as Mario, and will also feature luminaries such as Anya Taylor-Joy (Peach), Keegan Michael-Key (Toad), Jack Black (Bowser), Seth Rogan (Donkey Kong), and Charlie Day (Luigi).\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie is scheduled to launch in theaters in the UK and Europe in late-March. It will premiere in North America on April 7.

          "description": "I just called...\nGood morning, friends, and welcome to this week's edition of Whatcha Been Playing? It will be something of a shorter affair this time around, as I'm still technically off work — an endeavor that I have only been somewhat successful in maintaining. But, even when I'm not supposed to be here, I'm still gonna rock up for WBP? Not only is each and everyone one of you more than worth the time and effort, but, hey, I got a streak to maintain. So thanks for showing out this Saturday, and here's to a fine week for you all.\nto say...\nPlaying games for review. I guess that still counts as work, right? But time, tide, and embargoes wait for no man, and thus I've been bouncing between two games in lieu of upcoming reviews. The first is 110 Industries' silly slasher Wanted: Dead, which you can read all about next week, while the second is Inti Creates rat-a-tat-tat anime actioner Grim Guardians: Demon Purge, which is still a little ways away. I have much to say about both of these titles. Still, I'm afraid you'll have to hang on for the obligatory designated timestamp to pass before I can spill the beans on these particularly unique releases.\nI love you...\nAnywhoooo, I only have a mere two days left on my holiday — a holiday that has whizzed by at ungrateful speed — and thus I better get to trying to enjoy them. I will, of course, be sure to dive into all of your comments, so join the point and tell the community Whatcha Been Playing? There's sure been a lot of news and excitement so far this year, and hopefully, you've found something to get your gaming brain in gear for 2023. Tell us all about it, and share your thoughts. The World wants to hear it. And if it doesn't, we'll just force 'em to listen anyway.

          "description": "Rowr, Fsss! Fsss!\nMovie-licensed games have long been given a bad rap, but to be fair to them, that’s only because they’re usually bad. This goes back to the ‘80s, with some of the earliest video games to hit the market. I don’t have an explanation for why these titles are often bad. The fact that they have to be rushed to meet the same release date as the movie certainly does no favors. However, my theory is that, when a game already has advertising that comes from a larger industry, why even bother trying to make it good? It’s going to sell on recognition alone.\nWith that in mind, here we have 2004’s Catwoman, based on the film starring Halle Berry. It has the distinction of being based off what is considered by some to be one of the worst big-budget films of all time. It would be really…",

          "description": "Illumination has taken its promotion of The Super Mario Bros. Movie to the next level by launching a website and commercial promoting the brothers’ New York City plumbing business, and it's actually pretty cool. \nYou can visit the website here, which features a commercial promoting the Mario Bros. business. Older fans will likely recognize the catchy jingle as the theme song of the 1989 Super Mario Brothers Super Show, which is a nice homage. \n\n\nThe website also features humorous testimonials, job opportunities, and even a working phone number. Calling this number (929-55-MARIO) plays a recorded message by the Charlie Day-voiced Luigi, which provides a nice sample of his performance as the green-glad sidekick. Texting the number returns a message, which, depending on when you sent it, may return a digital poster for the movie. GI editor Kyle Hilliard got this Toad poster when he texted the number yesterday:\nIn my case, I only got a message thanking me for my interest in Super Mario Bros. Plumbing with a link to a form submission on the website. I'm not sure what you get for submitting this form, but feel free to find out yourselves. \nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie premieres in theaters on April 7. You can check out the official movie poster here. Watch the latest trailer featuring Donkey Kong and Cat Suit Mario here.",

Dambuster Studios has announced it’s bumping the game’s release from April 28 to April 21.\nThe news came in an announcement tweet declaring the game has gone gold, meaning it's essentially complete and ready to be printed on discs. Dead Island 2 had previously been scheduled to launch on February 3 before it was delayed to April 28. Speaking of April 28, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was recently pushed to that same day. It wouldn't be surprising if Dambuster moved its launch forward to steer clear of Star Wars' blast radius. \nYou asked for it, you got it.

Best of all, you can watch every episode right now. \nThe series, called PsychOdyssey, consists of a whopping 32 episodes, all of which are available to watch for free on Double Fine’s YouTube channel. Double Fine Adventure! earned praise for its raw, intimate look at the good, bad, and ugly sides of game development as the crew spent years filming in Double Fine's studio as Broken Age came together. Psychonauts 2's tumultous road to release, from crowdfunding campaigns to Microsoft's acquistion of Double Fine, makes its creation a fascinating subject, and we're excited to see how 2 Player Productions captured it. \n\n\nFor more on Psychonauts 2, you can read our review of the game here.

Rarely do driving games force a first-person view, and even fewer deviate from being a racer. \nPacific Drive does both, and after viewing roughly 30 minutes of gameplay during a virtual preview, I’m even more intrigued.

During today's Nintendo Direct, we got a new look at gameplay, plus the announcement of the Collector's Edition and a new Amiibo figure starring Link. However, we also got some unfortunate news surrounding the upcoming launch of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.\nIn its press release for the Nintendo Direct, Nintendo announced that the upcoming Zelda entry will retail for $69.99. This makes Nintendo the latest major publish to test the waters of raising the price of its triple-A titles in recent years. This follows other major publishers like 2K Games and PlayStation, who started pricing their major releases at $70 with the start of the new console generation in 2020. Last year, both Xbox and Ubisoft announced that their triple-A games would cost $70 going forward.\nWe reached out to Nintendo for comment regarding the reasoning for the price increase and if this will be the trend for its triple-A releases going forward, but did not immediately receive a response. We will update this story if Nintendo provides a statement.\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom launches on Switch on May 12.",

Like in the original game, we see a human-like lead character crash-landing on a mysterious planet in the trailer, but there’s plenty of new twists to keep things fresh.\nWe see a variety of Pikmin with different abilities, including Ice Pikmin that help to freeze enemies and targets. There’s also a cute dog-like creature that seems to ally with the player to smash through barriers, act as a mount, and other as-yet unrevealed capabilities.\nNintendo also appeared to reveal a release date for Pikmin 4, flashing up the date of July 21, 2023. It’s a good bet that players will be able to have those tiny sentient plant followers trailing behind them on that date when the game arrives on Switch.",

During our cover story interview with the two designers, they spoke candidly about the early phases of the game's development, their initial hesitation to tackle such an intimidating project, and how the team's approach in identifying areas for improvement gave them the confidence to see the project through. \nAmpo and Kadoi have plenty of experience working on Resident Evil.

There's no release date for the patch, nor does the message elaborate on the specifics of these improvements. \n“We are committed to making Forspoken the most enjoyable experience possible, and will provide an update about the timing of the next patch as soon as possible,” says Aramaki in the statement, which you can read in full below (click the image to enlarge). \nForspoken earned a 7.5 out of 10 review score from Game Informer, with editor Kyle Hilliard writing, “Forspoken's story and combat fail to reach the heights of its movement and exploration, but thankfully those two latter elements make up most of the experience. I sprinted, often literally, through the campaign in about 15 hours, and now I have a large world filled with nooks and crannies I'm eager to run through and explore. The narrative won’t linger with me, and I avoided combat in the open world often, but I loved making Frey leap and fly through Athia to discover all its treasure chests and secrets.” Check out our full review here.",

          "description": "To many, Cities: Skylines is the premier city-building simulation. When the PC launched in 2015, it quickly became a fan-favorite release for those who felt let down by modern SimCity titles. When the sim title arrived on consoles two years later, the less-intuitive controls didn't detract too much from the experience, enabling it to still deliver a terrific city-building experience. Now, developer Colossal Order and publisher Paradox Interview have announced Cities: Skylines Remastered, which improves the experience for console players in myriad ways.\nThis new version of Cities: Skylines aims to let players create bigger and better metropolises than ever before. In addition to the obvious graphical and performance upgrades enabled by the newer hardware, players can take their city-planning skills to the next level with up to 25 buildable tiles instead the 9 on PS4 and Xbox One versions. Additionally, players can look forward to a quick-selection tool, user-experience improvements like precision placements and updated snapping options, a new environmental control panel, a map editor, and the ability to place structures freely.\nPerhaps most importantly, anyone who owns the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One version and its DLC will receive Cities: Skylines Remastered and DLC (up to the Airports expansion) for free on their respective console family. Those who don't already own the last-gen console version can grab Cities: Skylines Remastered for $40.\nYou can see a very brief teaser rattling off some of the improvements the team made for this new version below.\n\n\nCities: Skylines Remastered arrives on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on February 15. The remastered versions of the DLC will become available in the coming months. For more on Cities: Skylines, read our 2015 review of the PC version here and the 2017 console version here.

Set many decades before the Harry Potter stories that unfolded in book and film, the game has a latitude to tell its own story with its own characters that is refreshing – even if there are a healthy smattering of familiar last names like Weasley and Black that are in the mix.

The teaser gave us a glimpse of Cat Mario's appearance in the film, as well as Donkey Kong's reaction. Today, Universal, Illumination, and Nintendo released the official movie poster for the Super Mario Bros. Movie.\nIn this new poster, we get a cinematic glimpse of the cast of main characters that we know of so far, including Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad, Bowser, Donkey Kong, and Kamek. Additionally, we see the opposing worlds in the apparent conflict of the film, with the darkness of Bowser's Castle contrasted by the bright and joyful Mushroom Kingdom. While nobody quite matches Donkey Kong and Toad's wide-eyed and unbridled bliss, every character on the poster is at least sporting a smirk.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie features an all-star cast, including Chris Pratt as Mario, Charlie Day as Luigi, Anya Taylor-Joy as Peach, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, Jack Black as Bowser, Seth Rogen as Donkey Kong, and Fred Armisen as Cranky Kong. We also know that Mario's video game voice actor, Charles Martinet, will have a cameo in the film at some point.\nTo this point, the movie has only received character-focused posters on top of a teaser poster that preceded the initial movie trailer. If you missed out on those posters, you can see every other character and teaser poster released for The Super Mario Bros. Movie below.\n\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie arrives in theaters on April 7.

Led by directors Yasuhiro Ampo and Kazunori Kadoi, who now sit at the helm of Resident Evil 4, the game revitalized the 1998 classic, introducded it to a new generation of fans, and paved the way for the RE3 and 4 remakes to come after.

          "description": "A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.6.1. It's time to prepare for a new release!\nOur lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:\nSoldier Boyz\nGLK Scott Adams Interactive Fiction games (C64 and ZX Spectrum)\nGLK Scott Adams adventures 1-12 (TI99/4A format)\nObsidian\nPink Panther: Passport to Peril\nPink Panther: Hokus Pokus Pink\nDriller/Space Station Oblivion\nHalls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II\nBesides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list. Maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long - otherwise, there are some demos of these games available on our website.\nAnd since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen notable changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.\nAs usual, we are not just adding support for new games. We are constantly working on improving the engines we already support and, in particular, we’ve seen some incredible work being done on the SCUMM engine. Yes, there are the usual bug fixes, but this time we are also adding a feature that helps playing the SCUMM games in a truly original fashion: Support for the original loading and saving dialogs within the GUI!\nSpeaking of truly original: Remember those old CRT displays we had back in the day? With ScummVM 2.7.0 you’ll be able to replicate this experience on certain platforms thanks to our new shader-based scalers. Go ahead and give it a try!\nAll testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.\nA detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.\nThank you very much for your support! Let’s make ScummVM 2.7.0 a great release - together!\n>",

Depending on your perspective, we’re either two months early for our usual April 1st release, or a bit tardy for the Christmas 2022 release we intended. We think the wait has been worth it. This is one of the largest releases we’ve done in several years, with numerous features and improvements covering the user interface, gameplay features, and modding extensions for NewGRF and Game Script creators. Some of the highlights are: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. This includes better automatic scaling when using HiDPI or mixed DPI setups. Direct access to NewGRF/AI/GS settings from the new game window. Various small tweaks and improvements to several windows. NewGRFs can now provide engine variants that are shown hierarchically in the purchase list. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. Custom league tables for GameScripts. More natural rivers which get wider as they flow downstream. And much more, which can be seen in the changelog or the previous release announcements! In addition to these features and improvements, we’ve fixed lots of bugs. (If you played with the RC2 testing release, most were fixed before then. See the changelog for full details.)
