You know, chaos emeralds, big 'staches, that sort of thing.\nThere's quite a lot packed into the 2-minute trailer, so below we present a gallery breakdown of some of the bigger moments. There's also a poll at the end where you can let us now what you thought.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It's a few years old now, first airing in 2016 before finishing in 2018, but there is one particular episode we will watch again and again. That episode is by the Bristol-based comic Mat Ewins, who in this set appears as a self-styled adventurer, film maker and amateur video game maker promoting his latest work Adventureman 7, a sort of budget Indiana Jones meets Tomb Raider kind of deal. \nHe's one of those comedians who uses a lot of multimedia in their sets, playing daft, self-made videos to help deliver punch lines. There's plenty of that nonsense in Ewins' set here, but for this occasion he also created an entire video game companion piece, styled up as a mid-90s, almost N64 / PS1-style affair in which - unsurprisingly - comedy antics ensue. Matthew and I love it to bits, and I thought that in this, the 25th anniversary year of Lara Croft, we should remember the incredible Adventureman and all of the brilliantly-bad video games he was in we never got to play. \nRead more",

It's a monstrous concoction of five roundabouts smoshed together, and as far as I can see it serves no purpose other than to terrify bamboozled drivers up and down the country. I'm not kidding. In 2009 it was named the fourth scariest junction in Britain, after London's equally mega roundabout at Marble Arch, the M8 junctions in central Glasgow and Birmingham's Gravelly Hill, affectionately known as Spaghetti Junction. \nIt's the kind of nightmarish urban planning I try to avoid when building my own road networks in Mini Motorways, the excellent sequel to minimalist transport sim Mini Metro, but its new Challenge City update puts all four of these real-world asphalt atrocities to shame. In this new mode, each city gets a bunch of new rules and conditions you'll need to abide by, and after playing an early version of it this week, there's one challenge that's truly diabolical. Not only does it limit the number of road tiles at your disposal, but it does so in favour of, wait for it, unlimited roundabouts. \nRead more",

I‚Äôd just been savaged by a bear, and had morosely jogged back over to my corpse from the respawn drop ship several miles away. It was dark, and also stormy, and also there were more bears. I desperately needed to find and reclaim my pack, stuffed with meat, tools and building supplies, which was proving difficult because your corpse just appears as a small pile of excruciatingly indiscernible brown sandbags. As the minutes dragged on, my mind flashed back to the time I spent half an hour searching for my wireless earphones amidst gails of horizontal rain on Brighton beach, shivering and still half-soaked from a foolhardy morning swim. The experience was so horrible it transcended mere discomfort and turned into, on some level, genuinely enjoyable farce. \r\n\n\r\nThat‚Äôs Icarus, that is. It‚Äôs obviously flawed, wildly frustrating and frequently janky, but it‚Äôs also somehow simultaneously good enough to have kept me playing into the early morning on multiple nights without even realizing the time. It‚Äôs like Schrodinger's cat, except if the cat was a bear made of draining thirst meters. I went on to spend another 20 hours (mostly) happily within its grasp.\r\n\n \nRead more",

After Volition's reboot of their wacky crime RPG series was revealed in August, then delayed in November, we were treated to a new gameplay trailer at last night's Game Awards.\nThe trailer is a series of clips, each averaging about 3 seconds long, of different people shooting different guns and rockets and so on. So it's technically a gameplay trailer in the way that loads of different corpses stitched together is a person (no comments from Frankenstein fans). Still, aside from confirming the new release date of August 23rd next year, I think this trailer also confirms that the new city of Santo Ileso is going to be the star of this game.

          "description": "After a crazy summer that saw Final Fantasy XIV‚Äôs playerbase expand dramatically during what was supposed to be a quiet period, it‚Äôs no surprise that anyone wanting to tuck into the new Endwalker expansion has a lot of queueing to do. But if you can stand the two hour waits and dreaded 2002 error then you‚Äôre in for a grand, if a little slow-starting, adventure.\nFinal Fantasy XIV: Endwalker is the final chapter in the story arc of warring gods Zodiark and Hydaelyn, and sees you trot across the globe to make new friends, fight old foes, and get some space travel under your belt. It‚Äôs huge. So huge that it‚Äôs going to take a few more weeks to soak it all in and do a full review justice. Between the queue times and sheer scale and finality of the story, Endwalker is a lengthy undertaking.\nRead more",

You know, the one where Mario will be played by Chris Pratt. In the event that the film turns out to be good, I will enjoy it - like how the Sonic film was actually pretty decent, especially James Marsden's star turn. But for now, Untitled Chris Pratt Mario Movie is bad, and a guilt-free laugh.\nI saw this extremely funny bingo card on Twitter and my eye was drawn to a discussion in the replies. One of the square on the bingo card is \"Jump by Kriss Kross plays\" and someone else says they think it's \"50/50 they choose Van Halen's \"Jump\" over Kriss Kross\", which leads yet a third person to bring up House Of Pain.

By my third restart I'd abandoned all interest in playing any character I wanted, and started trying to estimate whatever would get this over with sooner. Mechajammer is a disaster.

          "description": "The original Elex was divisive, to say the least. It was a game in which I was perpetually lonely and confused and being battered to death by carcinogenic poultry, but it must have been a profitable enough venture on its own terms to warrant a follow-up. That follow-up is Elex II, which is still several months away from release right now, but one I've been playing an early preview build of recently, showing off the first chapter of the game.\nI was talking to Graham (RPS in peace) about this and he said: \"Eventually one of these RPG sci-fi fantasy things will get close enough to being a BioWare game that it makes loads of money.\" This being the games equivalent of monkeys and typewriters. But although I agreed with Graham at the time, I think comparing it to BioWare might be mistaking the particular appeal of Elex II. It would be too simple to say that I \"enjoyed\" the hours I have spent with it so far. I didn't not enjoy it. I mostly came away respecting it for how little it respected me. Like the popular kids on the playground making life so difficult for you that you wish to become best friends with them.\nRead more",

Nintendo¬†heralded the title¬†as the end of an era for the series, but considering how well it's selling, it could also be the beginning of another golden age. Oddly, Dread might have one of the longest teases¬†in history, as its name first appeared back in 2005. In this week's show, we talk about our problems with the game's controls, what we thought of the difficulty, and what its big narrative reveal means for Samus' future.¬†\nJoin hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and special guest, soon-to-be-GameSpot-editor Jessica Howard (@awildjessichu) for¬†the next hour as we explore Metroid Dread's lore, development history, and lasting impact.¬†\nIf you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

Developer Ebb Software has finally spoken up to remind us that Scorn is still very much happening ‚Äì in fact, it‚Äôs arriving next October.¬†\nA cryptic trailer revealed the release window but didn‚Äôt divulge any new plot or gameplay details.

It is our hope that Scorn stays with players long after they reach its ending. We‚Äôre looking forward to sharing more news and updates with our community as we move closer to launch‚Äù\nSo far, we know that Scorn is a first-person shooter set within a labyrinthine world heavily¬†inspired by the art of H.R.

Since 2002, Valkyrie has worked on over 100 games, often serving the role of co-developer or content creator. In a tweet, Hermen Hulst, the head of PlayStation Studios, said Valkyrie \"will be making invaluable contributions to key PlayStation Studios franchises.\"\nValkyrie has worked with Sony several times in the past, helping bring Infamous, God of War, and Twisted Metal to market. The developer will once again be working with Sony Santa Monica on God of War: Ragnarok. \nIn a press release issued earlier today, a Sony spokesperson outlined the path forward. \"The day-to-day operations post-acquisition will continue to be run by Valkyrie Entertainment‚Äôs current management team. Terms of this transaction including the acquisition cost are not disclosed due to contractual commitments.\"\nAlong with the acquisition, Valkyrie has a big reason to celebrate, as it was one of the studios involved in helping create Halo Infinite, the fantastic sequel that we awarded a review of 9.25 out of 10. Other games that have Valkyrie's touch are pictured in the image above.\nSony and Microsoft are in a bit of an arms race, snatching up developers over the last few years to broaden their respective first-party game development efforts.",

Like its gen-1 predecessor, Hisuian Voltorb still resembles a Pok√©ball, only now, instead of looking metallic and grumpy, this sphere has angular, joyful eyes and wood grain throughout its lower half. The design is somewhat closer to the Pok√©balls you'll find or craft while playing Legends: Arceus.¬†It has a mysterious opening¬†on the top of its head, which the Pok√©mon website says spouts seeds, though \"it‚Äôs impossible to see anything even if one peers into the hole.‚Äã\" When this Voltorb gets excited or feels like it's in danger, that same hole is the source of discharged electricity.¬†\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nAlong with the announcement of Hisuian Voltorb, The Pok√©mon Company has released an adorable stop-motion animated short featuring the two-toned orb cheerfully irritating a Pikachu, Spheal, and Buneary. The video ends with a \"to be continued,\" so hopefully, we'll learn more about Voltorb or its¬†potential Hisuian Electrode evolution in the next one. With so many types of¬†Pok√©balls out there, with various designs and colors, I'd love to see a bunch of variations of Voltorb to match the look of a Quick Ball or a Nest Ball.\nPok√©mon Legends: Arceus is a semi-open world adventure where players step back in time to¬†explore the¬†Hisui region, which we now know as Sinnoh from Diamond and Pearl. Trainers take a more active role in battle and catching wild Pok√©mon, bringing the concept of the franchise a little further from its purely turn-based roots.

We‚Äôve been curious as to what developer The Pixel Hunt had up its sleeve next, and we found out yesterday with the reveal of its next project, The Wreck.\nThe Wreck is billed as a mature 3D visual novel. It stars a failed screenwriter named Junon who must relive one of the most important and, if the trailer is any indication, traumatizing days of her life.

That's right; you'll be able to voluntarily strap yourself into a simulated crewmate helmet and attempt to survive while a murderous imposter roams your ship. Or, you could be the one stabbing your friends in the back as they go about trying to swipe that key card just right.¬†\nThe trailer only showed a glimpse of the VR game's new look, but the 3D reimagining doesn't seem to deviate too wildly from Among Us' simplistic design. The footage shows us what it will look like to stand in the Skeld, scanning around suspiciously at the several vents strewn about the room while trying to punch in a series of numbers in the keypad before us. Everything seems fine...until it isn't and the screen goes blank. Among Us VR seems like a fertile ground for jump scares.¬†\nThe team did not share more about the title in the trailer, but Innersloth's website gave us a little more to go on:\nreally¬†have an emergency meeting together. (Note: VR version won't be compatible with the original Among Us game, so you'll only be able to play against other VR beans.)\n\nPlatforms, release dates, and additional information around Among Us VR will be announced at a later date. To stay updated, you can follow our new Among Us VR Twitter account or keep an eye on our site right here.",

As the camera pans out from a scene on Arrakis, we see a giant hand holding a portion of the planet, sand slipping from its fingers.\nThe game‚Äôs official site has more detail to offer, promising that Dune: Spice Wars is a real-time strategy game with 4X elements. The game is being developed by Shiro Games, the team behind the survival game called Northgard.\nIn the new Spice Wars game, players take charge of a faction vying for control of Arakkis, the only place in the universe where Spice can be found, a substance that can expand consciousness and allow for space travel across vast distances. Of course, players can take control of familiar factions like Atreides and Harkonnen, but it sounds like other factions are an option as well. The game is also promising a variety of mechanics and ways to aim for victory, including subterfuge, politics, growth of economy, or straight-up warfare. The game boasts 4X dynamics in real-time, as players will explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate while they seek control of the vast desert planet.\nDune: Spice Wars is coming to early access first to help further development of the project, and the first chance to try the game is on the way in 2022.\nDune is experiencing a particularly potent resurgence at the moment thanks to the new and successful film, and this first glimpse of the new game looks promising. ¬†\nClick here to watch embedded media",

The fireteam seems to¬†destroy the Hive Knight, but then it comes back from death. The combat must eventually turn out to the better, as the returning fireteam member has the remains of the Hive Ghost, but it‚Äôs clear that things did not go well on the mission.\nAfter the trailer, we also learned that the footage shown was from the opening mission of the new expansion.\nDestiny 2: The Witch Queen is set to release across all platforms on February 22.

Games announced the project with a small teaser that confirmed Monolith, best known for Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor,¬†would be acting as the developer.¬†\nThe trailer, which you can watch above, didn't give us much information, but it did begin with Diana's mother,¬†Hippolyta, calling Diana home, saying¬†a threat comes¬†to their shores. It looks like Wonder Woman will have a big weight on her shoulders as she'll have to restore what's been broken and make allies. \"You are a hero, but you can be more,\" her mother says. Wonder Woman's¬†shiny red, blue, and gold armor flashes with the iconic W,¬† and we then see her lasso in all its glory.\nThe trailer ends by saying:¬†\"You can be a leader,\" which makes us¬†curious how Monolith will challenge us with that task, especially since the brief description spoke about uniting old enemies and forging new bonds. Monolith is the studio that brought us the famous nemesis system, after all, so we wouldn't be surprised if it had some clever ideas for Woman Woman.\nThe trailer's Youtube description shed a little more light, saying Wonder Woman is an open-world action-adventure game where she'll¬†have to unite two worlds.¬†¬†It's also confirmed to be a single-player game, with an original story set in the DC Universe. The description also¬†said the game is powered by the nemesis system, so at the very least, we can count on that to enhance the experience.\nNo platforms were verified at this time, but we'll update the story when they're revealed.",

That means you‚Äôll be able to play as Yuffie and infiltrate a Shinra facility as the famed ninja on PC. You‚Äôll also get to play as Cloud, Aerith, and more through the base story of Final Fantasy 7 Remake, which happens to be great.

Rumored in one form or another for years, the new game promises to finally give us some answers about the enigmatic writer and his adventures ‚Äì or maybe just more questions.\nIn the trailer, we hear narration from a mysterious voice, talking about expectations for a story, but the realization that sometimes a story isn‚Äôt what you expect or want it to be. As the camera zooms in on a single figure in a desolate town, we hear the phrase: ‚ÄúThis story is a monster, and monsters wear many faces.‚Äù\nThe new trailer finally gave us a first look at Alan Wake II, including a release date of 2023. Remedy‚Äôs creative director, Sam Lake, was on site at The Game Awards to announce that this sequel is actually a survival/horror game, moving away from its action roots.\nUnfortunately, Remedy‚Äôs Lake also revealed that we likely won‚Äôt learn anything else about the game until summer of 2022.

When the giant beast walks into the cave, subsequently collapsing on the wall, the team attacks the monster, setting it ablaze. Soon after, Senua's team goes up in flames, as the beast slams its way around, trying to strike back at its aggressors. Spotting Senua and the remaining allies left living, the crew retreats, trying desperately to run away and retaliate as best it can.¬†\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nSenua and her team's efforts to bring down the beast all fall short as it continues to chase them outside of the cave, smashing surrounding structures. The trailer ends with the creature asking Senua for help. Senua replies, saying, \"I know you,\" as one of the voices in her head says \"It's you.\" The trailer ends there.\nHost Geoff Keighley said at the end of the trailer that what we were watching wasn't a cinematic, but real gameplay, though it was hard to tell how interactive anything shown off in the trailer actually was ‚Äì the camera was constantly whipping around during the trailer, seemingly indicating at least part of it was, in fact, cinematics. At the very least, it stands to reason everything we were seeing was running in-engine.¬†\nSenua's Saga: Hellblade II¬†will be released on Xbox Series X/S and PC.

But everyone needs a break now and then. In order to secure a much-needed vacation, you must steer¬†your executive team, the Sorrows, away from their over-enthusiastic spree on Earth.¬†\nStuffed with gorgeous visuals and hectic, 2D action, the trailer shows off what happens when Death takes matters into his own hands.\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nHave A Nice Death is coming to Early Access in March and, so far, developer Magic Design Studios has not announced whether the game will be coming to any consoles.
