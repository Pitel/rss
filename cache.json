If you’re now, as we are, extremely seasoned in the format pioneered by Symphony of the Night in 1997, you’ll likely rip through 9 Years of Shadows like a '46 Ford through a DeLorean. Ergo, like tinfoil.\nDeveloped by Mexican indie outfit Halberd Studios, it would, in our opinion, have made better literary sense to be dubbed ‘9 Years of Shadow’ - but then we're hopeless grammar Nazis because, it’s like, our job 'n' stuff. The story goes that a realm has been afflicted by a nine-year plague and, with it, the colour sapped from the land. Europa, the female protagonist, has watched friend and family pass to a sinister sickness while she somehow stands immune. She then decides to grab a weapon, don some armour, and head into an evil castle to destroy the core, as it were.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

So much love went into this game that even its flaws are endearing.\nWe all know that one friend who makes every relationship a bit messy. In the small town of Timber Hills, that person is Jala. She’s a first-rate skateboarder and heartbreaker, returning to her hometown after ruining yet another relationship. Waiting for her are her parents, her incredibly strong Auntie, and a host of scorned lovers looking to even the score.

The game has been given a new codename to celebrate: Kestrel. It's still a co-op multiplayer affair, however.\r\n\n\r\nThe reboot follows an evaluation period during which Remedy and publisher Tencent discussed a proof-of-concept version of the game, as we reported last month. They've now kicked it back to the concept phase \"due to uncertainties in creating a successful game [in] the rapidly changing free-to-play market and associated risks\". A few members of the old Vanguard development team have moved to other Remedy projects, while the core leadership and certain select developers carry on with Kestrel.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Spirittea from Edmonton, Canada-based Cheesemaker Games is Spirited Away in the guise of a Stardew Valley-style management sim. Released today, it casts you as a wholesome young entrepreneur who has just arrived in a town full of rogue supernatural creatures. To free the town from its spectral infestation, you must renovate an old mountain bathhouse and treat each phantom to a jolly good scrub. You might also need to deal with some Unfinished Business, such as tracking down a lost possession. At least there's no witch to worry about. That I know of, anyway.\r\n\n\r\nI have fond memories of Spirited Away - it was the film that re-introduced me to anime as an undergraduate, following the traditional early-career middlebrow otaku phase of obsessing over Akira, Cowboy Bebop and Ghost in the Shell while turning my nose up at stuff like Naruto, because it's \"just for kids\". I was on the brink of pitching a Spirittea review, but then our reviews editor Ed Thorn emerged howling and gibbering from the floorboards and asked me to review a 100-hour RPG instead (won't spoil), so I'll have to settle for trying the demo.\r\n \nRead more",

Speaking to me over Zoom one rainy October afternoon, Aureus recalls one particular table-top campaign he ran in which, after 10 or so sessions, the player party had sunk into abject poverty. \"They reached a collapsed village, [and] they said, 'is there a cart around here?' So I rolled the dice and decided that all right, there is a wagon, that's completely functional with all its wheels and so on. So they just started to walk around and shove on the top of their wagon, whatever of value they could find. \r\n\n\r\n\"They had no shame!\" Aureus goes on. \"Just gathering all the scraps of iron, all the tools, knives, musical instruments, pieces of fabric - anything they could find, they were just taking it all with them on the assumption that whenever they reached a civilised spot, they're just going to sell it all.\"  This was foolhardy behaviour, because all the objects in question were trash with little resale value. \"So they at the same time they had more than they could ever need, and they had pretty much nothing. They mainly had a hindrance that was slowing them down - this wagon full of stuff was just difficult to move through the paths.\" \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Speaking to investors in an earnings call this week, GTA 6 publisher Take-Two's CEO Strauss Zelnick had a bit to say about the eternally uncontroversial topic of videogame prices. In news worth holding the press for, he thinks they're pretty cheap for what you get in return.\nZelnick cautioned one investor against \"generalising\" about the state of game pricing based on the recent fortunes of TV and movie subscription services like Netflix, which have had to increase subscription fees to match their expenses after underpricing themselves initially to grow their audiences. Videogames might be all about subscription services these days, Zelnick said, but that doesn't mean they are subject to the same commercial logics as ye olde non-interactive media. In particular, it doesn't mean publishers are currently able to raise videogame prices, even if they feel like they're overdelivering.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The fake video games in movies and TV shows can be difficult to understand, for an obvious reason: they're not real games. Their function is providing a few seconds of motion, colours, and noises, and possibly a premise for a plot to riff on. They don't need to be coherent or good. Still, sometimes these glimpses and ideas are interesting enough that I quite enjoy trying to figure them out. Take Gods Of Combat, a fake first-person shooter featured in police procedural show Criminal Minds. Apparently it's such a great game that the only way to achieve a similar high after being banned is hijacking a schoolbus and forcing teenagers to kill each other.\nHere's a fun (nonlethal) game we can play together, reader dear: I'm going to describe Gods Of Combat as best I can, then you tell me how you think it works.\nRead more",

          "description": "As a staunch Nintendo head in the early console days, I would say my affection for PS1-era games is... present, but not particularly palpable. For me, the PlayStation One was mostly a machine to play Final Fantasies VII through IX on, and not much else (it was a very belated and cheap second-hand purchase, I should note, and games were still sufficiently expensive back then that maintaining two healthy game libraries for both the family N64 and my new Squall box was nigh on impossible). Nevertheless, I've been increasingly fascinated by the revival of PS1-era games in recent years, and it's been interesting to see which modern games have been \"demade\" in this style - see Bloodborne PSX - and which ones have made it their own from the off - see Signalis, Heartworm, and many others. \nCrow Country is the latest game I've seen to take up the PSX mantle, and it combines the chunkiness of Final Fantasy VII-style character models with the grimy survival horror of something like Resident Evil to brilliant effect. Made by SFB Games, the same devs wot made the also excellent Tangle Tower, it's currently got a very good demo up on Steam at the moment, and it's got me thinking: what do you like most about PS1-era games on PC, and which ones are your all-time favs?\nRead more",

There's the standard version of the pack, which includes access to previous expansions, currency for cosmetics and a level 70 character boost. The Heroic edition gives you all that plus a mount, a pet and extra in-game cash. And then there's the most expensive Epic edition, which includes a pet, two toys, 30 days of game time... and three days of early beta access to the game, yours for $89.99 in the states. \r\n\n\r\nNaturally, World of Warcrafters are rather concerned about the last bit. It's the first time Blizzard's long-running MMO has taken the paid early access approach, recently adopted by Starfield and Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 - there have been early access betas in the past, but they've been doled out by lottery. Blizzard's game director Ion Hazzikostas has now moved to reassure the grousers and gripers, promising that The War Within's Epic edition won't give minted early worms the edge over those poor peasants who scoop up the less pricey versions.\r\n\n \nRead more",

That warning was always qualified in that a more powerful Deck was still a ways off, and the Steam Deck OLED’s performance improvements are both tiny and a likely incidental result of its efficiency savings. This very point was repeated to me in an interview with Valve designer Jay Shaw and software engineer Jeremy Selan, which also covered the Steam Deck family’s future, its current struggles with intensive big-budget games, and why they want \"more, more, more\" rivals like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go.\r\n\n \nRead more",

In an RPS interview, the full version of which is coming soon, the two developers explained why the real next generation of Steam Deck will take a few years – and why they decided against making the Steam Deck OLED’s new processor more powerful as well.\nRead more",

As great a handheld gaming PC as the original Steam Deck is, its slightly bland IPS display and short battery life are some definite weak points – points to which newer, shinier rivals, such as the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go, have been happy to apply pressure.\nValve are keen to stress that this OLED-equipped model represents an update, not a whole generational switcheroo. Yet there’s much, much more behind that screen that just some different diodes. This is a lighter, brighter, longer-lasting, sometimes even faster-running take on the SteamOS handheld, and one that sneaks in some surprise upgrades as often as it addresses issues with the original Steam Deck. I love it.\nRead more",

As he makes clear to his army of Russian ultranationalists, he is interested only in their quiet, unwavering loyalty. Evidently, Activision expects much the same from its army of COD fans. This latest Modern Warfare campaign follows disconcertedly close on the heels of 2022’s entry because, as per Bloomberg, it began life as a mere expansion. Rather than allow a fallow year, Activision has upgraded that expansion’s status to a premium release, and charged $69.99 for pre-orders - granting early access to the single-player campaign as an enticement.\r\n\n\r\nInstead of Modern Warfare’s usual lead studio, Infinity Ward, development duties have fallen to Sledgehammer, the outfit most recently responsible for 2021’s unloved Vanguard. And in an industry where AAA FPS games now regularly take half a decade to make, this campaign has reportedly come together in less than two years. Reader: it shows.\r\n\n \nRead more",

A faked death finally saw him freed from the shackles of the yakuza with one big catch: he couldn't ever see his family again. Since then, we've had the plucky Ichiban take on the mantle of Tojo Clan nastiness in Yakuza: Like A Dragon (7), with its sequel Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth (8) set to wash up on Hawaii's shores next year. What do we know about Infinite Wealth? Kiryu is set to return as a protagonist alongside Ichiban, with an all-new haircut. And more importantly, what has Like A Dragon Gaiden got to do with any of this? Well, it's a shorter stop-gap between the events of Yakuza 6 and Yakuza 8 that fills us in on what Kiryu's been up to this whole time.\nBut aside from moreish minigames and a fantastic Agent persona with web-slinging abilities, Kiryu's epilogue is a far cry from Yakuza's best stories. By no means is it bad, it just isn't the best introduction to the series for newcomers, and even longtime fans will struggle balancing his resurrection with its heavy feelings of repetition.\nRead more",

I want someone who really, really loves and hates things, and gives you reasons why.”\nIt’s a trait which Giovannetti has in common with his Megacrit co-founder, Casey Yano, and has possessed ever since he was a kid growing up in Woodinville, 30 minutes outside Seattle. It’s matched by a competitiveness that first emerged in Warhammer 40,000 tournaments as a teen. Before he was old enough to drive, Giovannetti would ride his bike to the local game store and play until the early hours of the morning.\nRead more",

Echoing his relatively guarded enthusiasm for NFTs a couple of years ago, he’s sort of mixed on them, regarding AI tools less as transformative technologies than simply the latest step towards the eternal industry objective of More, Faster And Better For Less.\nZelnick thinks automated learning and generation tools will make development more “efficient” and games, overall “better”, but in terms of Take-Two’s own bottom line, any gains will likely be offset by the fact that other big companies have access to the same tools, and by the fact that Take-Two will take advantage of said efficiencies by setting more ambitious goals. As such, he doesn’t think using generative AI will lead to lower prices for big commercial games. If you’re a developer that can’t afford to buy or license generative “AI” tools, Zelnick added, you can expect competition to become “more intense” in the coming years. Good stuff. \nRead more",

          "description": "Hallowe’en may be over (just), but for this month’s Reality Frights, I’ve got a wonderfully seasonal game for you. It’s the brand-new remake of the grand old mystery puzzler The 7th Guest, a game which Bill Gates notably referred to as “The new standard of interactive entertainment.” In fairness to ol’ William, he said this seven months before Doom blew out the new standard’s insides with a 12-gauge shotgun, shunting PC gamers’ tastes away from kitsch adventure games and toward grisly murder-fests. But The 7th Guest is nonetheless fondly remembered for its spooky atmosphere, alongside its blend of pre-rendered backgrounds and live action cutscenes you could call ‘pioneering’ had it not proved such an evolutionary dead end.\nToday, the original 7th Guest looks more dated than Henry VIII, which is probably why this remake replaces everything but the very skeleton of the 1993 original. The game still takes place in a creepy mansion belonging to a murderous toymaker, and still involves six eccentric guests to the house searching for a missing boy named Tad. But it’s otherwise been completely rebuilt, with whole new puzzles and whole new mechanics, all designed to be experienced in first-person VR.\nRead more",

I've long admired their intricate dances of orbs and criss-crossing laser fire, but I have long resigned myself to merely being a spectator of such games, rather than an active ship pilot. Cobalt Core, however, is exactly my kind of speed. It's not a bullet hell shooter, but it is about two spaceships facing off against each other in an eyes-locked duel of incoming cannon fire, and sliding side to side to avoid getting exploded as you attempt to unravel the mysterious timeloop your crew of weird space animals appear to be stuck in. Just, you know, in a neat, turn-based fashion, where your opponent's attacks are flagged up in advance, and you must use your randomised deck of cards to weave and dodge your way to victory. It's very moreish, and very Into The Breach. I love it. \nRead more",

          "description": "Early on in The Talos Principle 2, one of your soon-to-be robot pals says to you with a completely straight face, \"We're here to solve this puzzle, not to discuss philosophy.\" I can almost see Croteam's writing team now, chuckling inwardly to themselves as they do a big silent wink to camera from behind the robot's eyes. You're not fooling me, Croteam. I'm here to solve puzzles and discuss philosophy, and I know you are too. You can't stop talking about philosophy in this game, and frankly, I wouldn't have it any other way. \nMillenia may have passed since the events of The Talos Principle, but the problems faced by this new society of advanced robo-humans (of which you are number 1000 to be 'born' into this world) still feel all too relevant to the issues posed by the lives we're living today: what is the price of progress? Will we ignore the mistakes of the past and push the world toward irreparable destruction? And why have cats remained loyal to this new race of robo-people, cementing their status as the superior future pet, when dogs have devolved back into vicious wolves? There are some puzzles too, I guess. Those are pretty great as well.\nRead more",

          "description": "When I reviewed Hunt: Showdown for a different parish back in 2019, it was a swampy, stealthy, slow-paced extraction FPS that consisted of weaving through mouldy undead and pockets of inconveniently noisy wildlife, ears pricked for the rustle of a rival player in the bushes. It was a game in which every footfall felt like a gamble and every second lasted an eternity, even before you entered the lair of a giant spider. Fast  forward to 2023, and streamers are playing Hunt: Showdown like it's Titanfall 2, scurrying along walls with scant regard for the NPC cannon fodder below, duelling each other on rooftops with pistol shotguns, and tearing through those poor, befuddled boss monsters like sandcastles.\r\n\n\r\nThus the fate of any competitive shooter lucky enough to acquire a seasoned pro following, I guess. But still, returning to Crytek's PvPvE shooter has been a shock, and speaking to the development team, it sounds like the devs themselves have been struggling to keep up with the more ambitious players, too. Showdown was never expected to endure quite this long and evolve in quite this way, according to general manager David Fifield, and managing the community's ambitions for the game is as much of a challenge as compensating for the limitations of its ageing engine.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I've not subbed because I'm just not built for anagram puzzles and I do not understand chess, which form about half of the daily offering, but I enjoy doing the daily fliparts and crosswords a lot.

What's clear is that it was interesting, both as an early example of an open-world RPG and as an infamously broken example of Eurojank. Now it's getting a re-release in just ten days and I'm fascinated to know whether a Boiling Point with fewer bugs has anything to offer the world in 2023.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's taking over the dark web... and IRL.\"\nYou don't need me to tell you that fake video games appearing in TV shows and movies are typically absurd and terrible. But just because something is bad, doesn't mean it's uninteresting. Having watched dozens of movies and episodes with fake video games, I'm going to celebrate a few over the coming weeks. Some daft fake games have neat ideas, some shows portray their fake games in an interesting way, and some fake games are even quite good. Let's start now with Deadware, an unknown horror movie which does a great job recreating something a bit bad: a spOooky haunted browser game from 1999.\nRead more",

At the time of writing, the former is just shy of 14,000 concurrent players, while the latter has nearly 16,000 for the Special Edition alone.\n\n\nAdd onto that the 1,796 fans playing just regular Skyrim and we get a picture of just how much more engaging Bethesda's 2011 epic RPG is.\n\n\nIt's a tall order to beat Skyrim\n\n\nOf course, given TES5's legacy – and having just celebrated 12 years – it's a tough act to follow, even from the game's own developer. Starfield launched to significant feedback, most of which was pretty glowing, but interest is definitely waning now.\n\n\nMaybe this is a question of overhype. Often, video games struggle to match the expectations that people have, and some of the time, it's the fault of the developer for pushing a product too hard (hello, No Man's Sky).\n\n\nThat's not to say Starfield is a bad game. It's been nominated for Best RPG at this year's The Game Awards, so it's not exactly without merit or kudos. There's just something about the fact that one of the most anticipated releases of this generation is seemingly losing its audience. And it's only been out a couple of months.\n\nThe post Starfield is now less popular than Skyrim in terms of concurrent players appeared first on Destructoid.",

Cureton is the Principal Designer working on Remnant 2, and he revealed that \"there is a very good chance\" more DLC will be coming.\n\n\nThis information comes from the latest of Gunfire Games' several AMA threads on Reddit, where Cureton goes into substantial depth about Remnant 2 and its ongoing development by responding to the players' questions. While it has been known for some time now that Remnant 2 would get three major DLCs post-release, Reddit user Korten12 asked whether more DLC might be coming once they are out. Cureton, using his \"verytragic\" Reddit account, responded with the quote featured above.\n\n\nAside from there…",

          "description": "While the original Alone in the Dark arguably set the scene for modern survival horror, Resident Evil is the one most think of when it comes to the genre. Capcom's legendary series has endured and while official remakes have been hitting the ground running, fan projects have also been attempting to leave their mark.\n\n\nTeam Arklay has recently uploaded a trailer for its unofficial remake of the first Resident Evil entry. Simply called Biohazard RE1, the upcoming game is being made in Unreal Engine 5, and from what we can see in the footage, it looks pretty impressive.\n\n\n\n\nWhile it's fair to say it's not exactly sporting photorealistic visuals, the post-cutscene moments definitely breathe new life into the OG RE. It should also be noted that this trailer is representative of work that's currently in progress. As such, we can expect things to look even better further down the line.\n\n\nA mix of old and new\n\n\nWhat's interesting about this fan remake is it seems to aim for the graphics of a more modern Resident Evil installment without compromising on some of that old horror movie cheese. The series has notably become a bit more serious and gritty over the years, so it's nice to see Team Arklay keeping some of that goofiness.\n\n\nBiohazard RE1 is still in development, with no projected release window yet. However, we know the game will give you the option to choose between the over-the-shoulder camera or go old school with a fixed camera perspective. Again, it seems to be going for a mix between classic and modern RE.\n\n\nThe future of Resident Evil is looking pretty good at the moment. Brand-new entries and official remakes have kept Capcom's franchise fresh and exciting. There was a period in which the RE name was starting to lose focus. However, with the way things are going, a ninth mainline game is something fans will be looking forward to.\n\nThe post Here’s the trailer for the upcoming UE5 fan remake of Resident Evil appeared first on Destructoid.",

It comes bundled with a display that looks like the front of Willy Wonka's whimsical store. \n\n\nDespite how delectable it looks, you can't sink your teeth into the console, though Xbox has come up with ways to satisfy your sweet tooth.

To do so, simply follow Xbox on Twitter and retweet the competition announcement with the hashtag #XboxWonkaSweepstakes. It appears that this will be your only shot at a chocolate Xbox, as the prizes are \"limited to sweepstakes only – not available for retail.\" \n\n\n\n\nThe chocolate console isn't where the Xbox and Wonka collaboration ends.

Solve the puzzle, and you'll stand a chance to win some custom Xbox goodies. \n\n\nThe upcoming film hit screens on December 15, and it explores Willy Wonka's rise to stardom as a quirky chocolatier.

          "description": "The console wars continue to rage on, as always. Nothing gets the gaming market fired up quite like being at loggerheads with competitors. There's never usually a clear winner, but for the UK, the PS5 seems to be outshining the rest.\n\n\nAccording to Gamesindustry.biz, a report from GfK – a data and market intelligence analyst – reveals Sony's current-gen system has been doing remarkably well in the UK. Between November 2022 and October 2023, the PS5 had a 43% market share. However, over the past six months, this has increased to 51%, giving a majority slice.\n\n\nGfK boss Dorian Bloch says this rise could be down to \"unrestricted sales on the standard PS5 hardware model, aggressive price promotions in July and August, and the recent EA Sports FC 24 bundle.\"\n\n\nThe upcoming Slim model as well, perhaps?\n\n\nCompare that to platform rivals like Xbox, in which figures indicate a three percent drop in the same time frame. This means the Microsoft console went from a 26% market share to just 23%. Similarly, the Switch experienced a much bigger drop, which is down to 34% from 25%.\n\n\nWhether these trends will change is up for debate.

Nintendo has announced a new Indie World Showcase will air tomorrow, November 14.\n\n\nThe Indie World Showcase is set to spotlight around 20 minutes of information on both new and known games coming to the Nintendo Switch. It will air at 9 a.m. PT / noon ET on Nintendo's channels. You can follow it here as well.\n\n\n\n\nAs a reminder, this is an indie showcase, not a Nintendo Direct. So any hopes you might have for a new Switch or other reveal, don't expect that sort of thing here. Instead, Nintendo's indie showcases highlight third-party games, usually from smaller developers.\n\n\nWhat to expect at the Indie World Showcase\n\n\nI mean, it's an Indie World Showcase. The Silksong hope is tangible in the air. It's there, like it is every time we have one of these.\n\n\nOtherwise, there are a few indies waiting in the wings. Animal Well, Rift of the Necrodancer, and Little Kitty, Big City are all games that have shown up at previous showcases that could reappear here.\n\n\nBut really, it's the surprises I always like the most in the independently focused showcases. Games that I hadn't heard of suddenly rocketing onto my radar. And of course, surprise drops. Who doesn't enjoy a good \"it's out later today\"?\n\n\nSo we'll see what Nintendo has in store for this end-of-the-year indie news lineup, in an already stacked year for games. Maybe there's something waiting to make GOTY even tougher than it already was.\n\nThe post A new Nintendo Indie World Showcase airs tomorrow, November 14 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Pleasant though it was, one person felt it needed a bit of tweaking.\n\n\nVeteran Skyrim modder JaySerpa is back again with another improvement to TES5. This time, they've decided to overhaul the fishing aspect of the game. Their latest mod tackles (funny joke!) the overall mechanics of this chill mini-game.\n\n\n\n\nIn particular, they've added a third-person mode, made it so you can move the camera around in first-person, and added a \"bait requirement\" as an optional addition.\n\n\nNot all citizens approve, though\n\n\nIt wouldn't be a JaySerpa mod without the addition of some new dialogue. In this instance, we get to hear what Skyrim NPCs think about us stopping for a little bit of fishing betwixt questing. Around 200 lines have been added in, allowing for a more immersive experience as followers react to your newfound hobby.\n\n\nThe above video gives us an idea of what kind of dialogue can be spoken. This could be someone simply saying they'll stand guard while you fish. Others simply comment on how much they enjoy the sport. Then there are those who suggest an air of ennui or even boredom.\n\n\nIn any case, it's just one more way to kick the immersion of Skyrim up another notch. The modder says this should be compatible with other fishing quality-of-life mods, but they also warn the animations in third-person are \"not perfect.\" But what is in this wild world?\n\nThe post Skyrim mod overhauls fishing, includes a third-person mode appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Having just passed its 12th birthday, Skyrim continues to take up real estate in the AAA gaming sphere. As one of the most successful RPGs in recent memory, Bethesda's epic Elder Scrolls game is still quite pretty, but has evidently aged over the past decade or so.\n\n\nThat's where artist and YouTuber Leo Torres coming into the picture. As spotted by DSO Gaming, Torres has recently uploaded a new video showing what Skyrim would look like were it built today in Unreal Engine 5.\n\n\n\n\nMore specifically, we get to see some incredible shots of the bitterly cold northerly city Winterhold. It looks, for want of a better phrase, pretty spectacular, which is not something many people are willing to say about TES5 these days.\n\n\nWhat could have been\n\n\nIn this era of remakes, it's fun to imagine what an aging game like Skyrim would look like in something such as Unreal. Torres' render gives us a taste of how things could have been in a different universe. Obviously, this is just a video render demonstrating Winterghold at a \"more realistic and lore-accurate scale.\" It's not a remake currently in development, official or otherwise.\n\n\nIt also gives us an idea of just how far gaming visuals have come over the years. That's not to say Skyrim is ugly (far from it), merely that many of us take it for granted just how advanced graphics become given enough time.\n\n\nAs for The Elder Scrolls itself, we're currently on day seventy-squillion (citation needed) and no word on the sixth entry yet. There's a good chance Skyrim's popularity may drop off suddenly once TES6 comes out, but we'll probably all be a lot older and wiser by then.\n\nThe post If you haven’t seen Skyrim in Unreal Engine 5, you’re missing out appeared first on Destructoid.",

Amidst the lively conversation, Patricia Summersett, who voices Zelda in Tears of the Kingdom, has stated that she would love to return to her role in the upcoming movie. \n\n\nIn an interview with GamesRadar+, Summersett reveals just how attached she has grown to her role since she voiced in Breath of the Wild. Though she's voiced the princess in three games already, including Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, she claims she \"could always take more of it.\" Of course, this doesn't mean that her return has been confirmed in the upcoming movie, as the cast list has yet to be revealed. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\nThe Legend of Zelda movie\n\n\nEarlier this year, there were rumors that a The Legend of Zelda movie is in the works courtesy of Illumination. The rumors were proven false, though they did correctly predict that Nintendo is working on adapting its highly successful franchise. \n\n\nThe movie is being directed by Maze Runner's Wes Ball, and it will be produced by Pikmin creator Shigeru Miyamoto and Avi Arad who is chairman of Arad Productions Inc. Somewhat surprisingly, the film is receiving financing from Sony Pictures Entertainment, though more than 50% will be financed by Nintendo. \n\n\nWith no DLC planned for Tears of the Kingdom, the announced movie is something for fans to look forward to if they're searching for their next big dose of Zelda.

One catchy song in particular has been popular enough to inspire a fan-made music video for it. Major spoilers are ahead if you haven't played Initiation 4: We Sing.  \n\n\nIn Initiation 4, Alan finds himself in a weird musical featuring Sam Lake, Mr Door, and the Old Gods of Asgard. The chapter mixes live action with animation, and it provides lyrics so that you can sing along while catching up on the plot thus far. An unofficial video has been made by blending different scenes from throughout the game. It’s done so brilliantly that you’d swear it was an official music video from Remedy.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\nMusic in Alan Wake 2\n\n\nThe song, called 'Herald of Darkness', is performed by the Finnish band Poets of the Fall who appear as the fictional band Old Gods of Asgard in the Alan Wake franchise. They play a pivotal role in Alan Wake 2 by helping Saga perform a summoning ritual near Cauldron Lake. The band's songs also contain lyrics that are relevant to the game. \n\n\n\n\nAlan Wake isn’t the only game where Remedy has gone crazy with music. In Control, the soundtrack helps to set the atmosphere, and the Ashtray Maze in particular offers an unforgettable blend of music and game to keep your adrenaline pumping.\n\n\n\n\n'Herald of Darkness' is hitting major streaming sites, including Spotify and Apple Music, on November 15. On December 8, you’ll be able to pick up the Old Gods of Asgard Rebirth - Greatest Hits album. It contains songs from the band found in the Alan Wake series and Control.\n\n\nWe may still get to hear more from the band, as Remedy has DLC planned for Alan Wake 2.

Upon its release on Switch and PC, the game was lauded for its character design and addicting roguelike gameplay.\n\n\nOur own Jordan Devore rated the game a 9/10, citing Supergiant Games' strong storytelling and stellar RPG combat. Hades was nominated for multiple Game of the Year awards and even won Destructoid's own Overall Best Game of 2020. \n\n\nI played the heck out of Hades when it was on Game Pass. Seeing it made available for all Netflix subscribers is a joy. Now, more people can play this stellar game whenever and wherever they want. It's a trip to Hell I am down to go to.\n\n\nThe timing for Hades to come to Netflix is pretty coincidental, as Supergiant Games is expanding the universe next year with Hades II. The game, which made its way onto my RPGs to look out for, follows Zagreus' sister, Melinoë. Instead of her father, she'll face the Titan of Time alongside new faces. The game is set to go Early Access in Q2 of 2024 for PC. While it's set to release on consoles, no specifics were given.\n\nThe post Beloved roguelike Hades is joining Netflix’s gaming service appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The adventures of Lara Croft are looking quite promising. As part of Netflix Geeked Week, Legendary Entertainment released a behind-the-scenes look at the Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft series.\n\n\nPowerhouse Animation Studios, known for its Castlevania series, is taking on the daring archaeologist with the help of Legendary Entertainment. Based on Crystal Dynamics' reboots/prequels, Netflix's Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft sets up the Lara seen in the 1996 original. The video, narrated by Character Design Supervisor Joy Lua, showcases the globe-trotting journeys we'll see her take, as well as some callbacks to different games.\n\n\n\n\nTomb Raider steps out of the shadows for Netflix\n\n\nThe video starts with some drawings and rough storyboard scenes, previewing some of the show's worldwide action. We see Lara snowboarding off a parachute and traversing buildings in Paris like an action hero. As Lara in the reboot trilogy usually stayed in one country, it's cool to see her out and about. \n\n\nConcepts for the places she'll go (yes, including tombs) are shown toward the end. She'll also sport some new gear, donning a dress in one shot and snow gear in another. Of course, she'll have her bow, pickaxe, and pistols alongside her. The team aims to provide many Easter eggs for longtime fans and bridge the gap between old and new. \n\n\nWhile the animated Netflix series picks up after Shadow of the Tomb Raider, reboot era Lara voice actress Camilla Luddington of Grey's Anatomy is not reprising her role, with Marvel the MCU's Agent Carter, Haley Atwell, picking up the dual pistols. Jonah, played by Earl Baylon, is back and given a small look via concept art. As a fan of Castlevania and Powerhouse, as well as the reboots, it seems like Lara is in good hands.\n\n\nTomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft is slated to release sometime in 2024. \n\nThe post New Tomb Raider show gets behind-the-scenes look appeared first on Destructoid.",

This brand-new character sports a lightning-quick moveset, earning her the nickname “Purple Lightning,\" and has mysterious ties to the Mishima clan.\nBandai Namco states that little is known about Reina's history besides she’s a student of the Mishima Polytechnical School.

Check Reina out in action below. \n\n\nWith Reina’s addition, the 32-fighter roster is now complete. Here’s the full list of characters, with new fighters denoted and links to applicable articles/trailers:\nAlisa Bosconovitch\nAsuka Kazama\nAzucena Milagros Ortiz Castillo (New)\nBryan Fury\nClaudio Serafino\nDevil Jin\nFeng Wei\nHwoarang\nJack-8 (New)\nJin Kazma\nJun Kazama\nKazuya Mishima/Devil Kazuya\nKing\nKuma\nLars Alexandersson\nLee Chaolan\nLeo Kliesen\nLeroy Smith\nLili Rochefort\nLing Xiaoyu\nMarshall Law\nNina Williams\nPanda\nPaul Phoenix\nRaven\nReina (New)\nSergei Dragunov\nShaheen\nSteve Fox\nVictor Chevalier (New)\nYoshimitsu\nZafina\nAdditionally, the game's first Season of post-launch DLC will add four unannounced fighters.

          "description": "Amazon is laying off 180 jobs in its games division, hopping on the tragically overcrowded bandwagon of layoffs in the game industry this year. The news comes via Aftermath, which reports that the layoffs are focused in two areas – the Crown Twitch channel, which will reportedly be eliminated altogether, and the game growth teams. Employees were notified of the changes through an email from Christoph Hartman, VP of Amazon Games. This is the second wave of layoffs this division of the company has faced this year.\nAn excerpt of the announcement email can be read below:\nThere have been so many layoffs in the gaming industry this year that it's getting hard to keep track of. Last week, we learned Free Radical Design is on the verge of closing down and that Ubisoft laid off more than 100 employees. The week before that, roughly 100 employees were laid off at Destiny 2 developer Bungie. \nIn January, Microsoft laid off 10,000 employees amidst its ongoing $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which it completed last month. \nIn August, Striking Distance Studios, the team behind last year's The Callisto Protocol, laid off more than 30 employees, and that same month, Mass Effect and Dragon Age developer BioWare laid off 50 employees, including long-time studio veterans. The following month, in September, Immortals of Aveum developer Ascendant Studios laid off roughly 45% of its staff. \nJust last month, The Last of Us developer Naughty Dog laid off at least 25 employees, and Telltale Games underwent layoffs as well, although an actual number of laid-off employees has not yet been revealed. And in late October, Dreams developer Media Molecule laid off 20 employees.\nThe hearts of Game Informer's staff are with the people laid off from Amazon Games, along with everyone else who has lost a job this year.\n[Source: Aftermath]",

          "description": "Before Insomniac created its stellar Spider-Man trilogy and before Treyarch redefined web-swinging with the 2004 Spider-Man 2 movie tie-in game, the folks at Neversoft gave Spidey fans the best example of wall-crawling video game excellence with its 2000 take on the character. Spider-Man sees the friendly neighborhood hero battle a star-studded gallery of villains in an original adventure chock full of comic book goodness. As Spider-Man's first fully 3D action-adventure game, it laid the groundwork for mechanics such as web-swinging, a variety of web shooter attacks, and wall-crawling stealth gameplay. Let's see how it holds up 23 years later. \nStarting today and every Friday at 2 p.m. Central on Twitch,  join Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they'll stream two hours of the game each week until they beat it.

The first season hit the subscription streaming service in November of 2021and now we know that Arcane Season 2 hits Netflix this time next year. \nMore specifically, Arcane Season 2 drops on Netflix in November of 2024. To coincide with the news, Netflix has released a short teaser featuring Jinx. Check it out below: \nArcane. Season 2.

As of August, Grand Theft Auto V has sold more than 185 million copies since its release 10 years ago. \nOfficial news of this trailer from the Rockstar Twitter account comes less than a day after a Bloomberg report that states Rockstar will reveal the sequel, presumably titled Grand Theft Auto VI or Grand Theft Auto 6, this week with a trailer for it arriving sometime next month; Since the release of this report yesterday, Rockstar has confirmed a trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto will, in fact, be released in December. \nWe are very excited to let you know that in early December, we will release the first trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto. We look forward to many more years of sharing these experiences with all of you.\nNovember 8, 2023\nGame Informer has reached out to Rockstar's parent company Take-Two Interactive to ask about this report and reveal and will update the story if more information is learned. \nThe journey to the reveal of the next Grand Theft Auto has not happened quietly. In September of last year, unprecedented leaks gave fans a potential look at the sequel in over 90 videos showcasing secret in-development footage of the open-world crime sequel.  We also learned last year that the game reportedly stars a female protagonist. Bloomberg says this Grand Theft Auto V sequel is set in a fictional version of Miami and features the aforementioned female protagonist as well as a male protagonist. \n\n\nWhile waiting to learn more about Rockstar's next game, read Game Informer's Grand Theft Auto V review and then read our thoughts on Red Dead Redemption II.

The cuts included administrative and IT workers, some of whom were employed at the Hybride VFX studio, a company that has worked on shows like Ahsoka and The Mandalorian.\n\n\n\"These are not decisions taken lightly and we are providing comprehensive support for our colleagues who will be leaving Ubisoft during this transition,\" the company told both IGN and Kotaku. \"We also want to share our utmost gratitude and respect for their many contributions to the company. This restructuring does not affect our production teams.\" Another quote obtained by Kotaku claims that the layoffs are to allow Ubisoft to \"to optimize its resources to be more sustainable in the long term.\"\nThis news comes after a year of several big Ubisoft releases, including Assassin's Creed Mirage, The Crew: Motorfest, and Just Dance 2024, but that's in spite of the fact that they canceled several games this year and delayed Skull and Bones... again. Unrest at the company has been ongoing as well: back in September, IGN reported widespread frustration after employees were suddenly called to return to in-person working conditions.\nUbisoft now joins Bungie, Media Molecule, Telltale Games, Team17, Epic Games, Naughty Dog, Microsoft, and more on the unfortunately long list of companies that have laid people off in the past year.\n[Sources: IGN, Kotaku]",

          "description": "The Switch continues to inch closer to becoming Nintendo's best-selling hardware ever, as it has now surpassed 132 million units sold. It did so thanks to great software sales for new first-party games released this year like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Pikmin 4. \nThis news comes from Nintendo's Fiscal Year 2024 second quarter financial results, which ended September 30. In it, we learn the Switch has officially reached 132.46 million units sold, getting it closer to the company's best-selling hardware, the Nintendo DS at 154.02 million units sold. The only other console above the DS overall is the PlayStation 2 at roughly 158 million units sold. \n\n\nIt's possible the Switch reaches the DS' numbers, assuming a new-gen console doesn't end sales of the hardware.

          "description": "PlayStation integration with X (formerly known as Twitter) is ending for PS5 and PS4 next week via a new update. That means users will no longer be able to directly upload screenshots and video clips from the console to the social media site.\nAn announcement update posted to the PlayStation Support page states that on Monday, November 13, X integration will end, which includes the ability to “view any content published on X on PS5/PS4, and the ability to post and view content, trophies, and other gameplay-related activities on X directly from PS5/PS4 (or link an X account to do so).”\nWhile a bummer for those who make frequent use of this feature, which offers a simple method of posting gameplay content to the platform, there are a couple of more involved alternatives depending on your platform. If you’re a PS5 user, you can still use the PlayStation mobile app to upload gameplay captures to then post on X. You can read how to do that here. PS4 users have to rely on ShareFactory and do a bit more work, and you can read those steps here.\nMicrosoft made the same move in April by disabling sharing to X directly from the console and instructing players to instead use the Xbox app on mobile (with some speculating the decision was made to avoid paying the platform's then-new monthly application programming interface (API) fee). This now means that the Switch will become the sole console that supports direct media sharing to X. \nWhat do you think about the decision to end X integration? Did you use this feature regularly?

The Diablo team revealed this news over the weekend during BlizzCon 2023, which is also where we learned about three new World of Warcraft expansions and three new Overwatch 2 heroes coming to the game. \nDuring BlizzCon 2023, Blizzard kept Vessel of Hatred details light, stating it will share more details next summer. As for what to expect, it features a campaign that continues the dark tale that began in Diablo IV. \"Vessel of Hatred brings players back to learn the fate of the prime evil Mephisto and his demonic plans for Sanctuary,\" a press release reads. \"Travel to the lush jungles known by the locals as Nahantu.\" \nCheck out the Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred expansion announcement trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nBlizzard says Vessel of Hatred will allow players to traverse an exotic new region, vanquish new evils, and perhaps most excitingly, explore fresh ways to kill demons and loot chests with a completely new Class \"never seen before in the Diablo universe.\" \nAnd that's all Blizzard shared about Vessel of Hatred. Diablo IV's first expansion is due out in late 2024. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Diablo IV review and then check out this story about how Diablo IV (and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III) won't be coming to Xbox Game Pass this year, even though Xbox now owns Activision Blizzard.

Plus, the Overwatch 2 team teased a new DPS hero and Support hero hitting the roster sometime down the line. \nMauga was actually playable for free as a part of a limited-time trial run for the tank hero this past weekend, but he's already out of the game; his real debut happens alongside Overwatch 2's Season 8 launch on December 5. \"Equipped with two chain guns (Gunny and Cha-Cha), Mauga is ready to bash through the front lines of his opponents and tear through anyone that stands in his way with tons of fire-power,\" Blizzard says about the hero. \nWatch the official Mauga gameplay trailer below: \n\n\nHere are some additional Mauga screens from Overwatch 2: \n\nElsewhere during the Overwatch 2 BlizzCon 2023 presentation, which is where Mauga was revealed, Blizzard pulled back the curtains on two more heroes coming to the game sometime in the future. The first is a DPS hero named Venture, with a unique Splatoon-ish weapon: \nThe second is a new support hero codenamed Space Ranger, and given this hero does not yet have an official title, it's the hero we're expecting to debut in Overwatch 2 last out of these new ones. \nThe final piece of Overwatch 2 from BlizzCon 2023 is Clash, a new PvP mode where two teams are tasked with capturing five distinct points on a map. Perhaps most excitingly, Blizzard is bringing back Overwatch map Hanamura as playable in Clash, except under the new name Hanaoka.

Humanity's story reflects real-world events, showing us the paths we're currently on.\nWatch The Documentary:\n\n\n\"Soon after we began making Humanity, a number of big events and movements broke out around the world,\" Enhance founder and CEO Tetsuya Mizuguchi tells us. \"There were human rights movements, the Hong Kong protests, [and] then there was the pandemic. And war soon followed in Ukraine. We had no idea how quickly and deeply AI would infiltrate our society either. I think all these things found their way into the core of Humanity. That question, for example, 'What is humanity? What is human nature?' We would often talk about how people, looked at individually, are good. There are so many wonderful people out there. But when they become a group, or a nation, or even just big groups, at that level, something happens. It's like a different switch gets flipped. And what you see there, that is what we're trying to depict in Humanity.\"\nWatch above or over on Game Informer's YouTube channel to see the full documentary about the making of Humanity. \"Violence Is Inevitable\" speaks to the core creative team, including Mizuguchi and tha creative director Yugo Nakamura, about the project's origins, its complications and lengthy development cycle, and how it came to show us the nature of humanity.",

          "description": "Earlier this year, HBO's The Last of Us successfully brought developer Naughty Dog's critically acclaimed and fan-favorite PlayStation exclusive to life on the TV screen. Its Season 1 premiere was HBO's second-largest debut since 2010, and its second episode broke records, too. Roughly three weeks after the premiere of the series, HBO revealed The Last of Us would be getting a second season. And now, thanks to a new Deadline report, we know it will start shooting next year and premiere sometime in 2025. \nDeadline learned this at a New York news event, where HBO boss Casey Bloys reportedly told press that Season 2 will head into production early next year, aiming for a 2025 premiere. Unfortunately, that's all Bloys said about the season. But, as noted by Deadline, series co-creator and executive producer Craig Mazin revealed earlier this summer pre-strike that the team was already able to get some work done, adding that the first episode was already written. \n\n\n\"We got pretty far actually, we were doing great,\" Mazin told Deadline. \"[The Last of Us game co-creator Neil Druckmann] and I had been sitting and talking with [The Last of Us Part II co-writer Halley Gross] and Bo Shim, the new writer that was in our little tiny room with us – obviously not a mini room because we're greenlit proper, we're a real show, and because I hate that mini room stuff.\"\nConsidering the first season of The Last of Us covered the events of the first Last of Us game, including its Left Behind DLC, it's clear Season 2 of the show will dive into The Last of Us Part II. We're all still awaiting some casting announcements, like who will play Abby and Lev, but that likely won't happen until the actor and writer strikes are over. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's The Last of Us Part 1 review and then read our review of The Last of Us Part II. \n[Source: Deadline]\nHow far into The Last of Us Part II do you think Season 2 will go? Let us know in the comments below!",

As always, if you encounter any issues, please submit a bug report to our issue tracker.\n>",

          "description": "We are very pleased to announce today the start of the testing period of two single-game engines: Kingdom: The Far Reaches and Escape From Hell!\nKingdom, was developed and released by Interplay in 1995. Only the DOS version of the game (available on gog.com) is supported. It's a cartoon FMV game, with an inventory, in which you have to guide Lathan Kandor through a medieval world, discovering the magic spells and the items required to defeat an evil wizard. \nEscape From Hell, was developed for Electronic Arts by the game veterans Richard Seaborne and Alan Murphy and was released in 1990. You play Alan in this keyboard-only Role Playing Game and visit Hell, looking for your girlfriend who was accidentally teleported there.\nBoth games use heavily hardcoded logic which is error prone and requires a lot of testing, so we need your feedback more than ever as they are both incompletely tested. There is sadly only one known demo for Kingdom. Support for the Windows and Mac versions of Kingdom may come later! Please contact us if you have some other demos of both games.\nTo play any of these games, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker and please take some screenshots along the way!\n>",
