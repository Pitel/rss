This time, the legendary game designer breaks down the game's \"unique\" control scheme and explains the difficulties that the team had in developing the title.\nPart on-rails shooter, part third-person shooter, Uprising has a slightly unusual control scheme that even Sakurai notes \"takes some getting used to\" — moving Pit with the Circle Pad and using the touchscreen to change the camera angle and aim attacks wasn't the easiest to grasp, we'll admit. Over the years, we wondered why a title such as this didn't make the most of Nintendo's Circle Pad Pro — the 3DS accessory that connected to the handheld to add an extra circle pad and shoulder buttons — to implement true twin-stick controls, but it turns out that there was a very simple answer: space.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Where did it come from?\nFor a good few years now, we believed that the title (at least, the Japanese \"Mujura's Mask\" one) was born out of a mash-up between the surname of the game's art director, Takaya Imamura, and the 1995 Robin Williams movie Jumanji.

(In fact, I just spent the last few days finding the perfect aftermarket cushions for my Arctis Nova Pro Wireless just to give it a unique look.) \nTherefore, I thought I'd let you know about a great price for the entry-level Arctis Nova 3, a wired version of the headset that offers the same comfortable design at a lower weight and with support for a wide range of USB devices from PC and Steam Deck (via USB-A or USB-C) to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and more. \nIt's currently on sale for $70 at Amazon US, a tidy 30% discount from its original US MSRP of $100 as part of an early Prime Day deal. \nRead more",

          "description": "Thrilling as it may be to swing a lightsaber or shoot a headcrab in stereoscopic 3D, the VR experiences I crave most are those which use the tech to fold my brain into entirely new shapes. 2019's A Fisherman's Tale was one of those. An unassuming first-person puzzler about a puppet fisherman living in a lighthouse, it dazzled with its incredible deployment of VR's unique sense of perspective and scale. It's the kind of game that, if it featured a psychotic AI and some cake memes instead of a beard in a yellow anorak, would have been heralded as a revolution in play.\r\n\n\r\nIt would have been easy to follow-up A Fisherman's Tale in the same way, make a bigger game with a few new gimmicks and a comedy lobster voiced by Stephen Merchant. But that isn't what developer InnerspaceVR has done. Instead, Another Fisherman's Tale bends your neural pathways in entirely new forms, offering a completely different kind of puzzling. The results are equally innovative and almost as interactively satisfying - although a lack of refinement in the latter category is a deflating puncture in the game's dinghy.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Flock is the next game from the makers of Wilmot's Warehouse, Hohokum and I Am Dead, but ever since it was announced last year, I've been wondering about exactly what kind of game it is. The first trailer revealed lots of strange, whimsical environments, equally whimsical-looking beasties and a little person flying around on the back of a giant bird herding them around in delightful swoops and swirls. We also saw some sheep grazing in a meadow before they, too, started to fly alongside your wilder, more abstract animal pals. But the question of what you do in Flock remained unanswered - until last week, when developers Hollow Ponds showed us a little bit more of their creature collecting game during the Annapurna Interactive Showcase stream.\nThere, they revealed that we'll need to collect and charm these creatures to get them to join our respective flocks, and that we'll be able to do so in co-op with a pal. It looks intensely charming, but it still left me with lots of unanswered questions. So I spoke to devs Ricky Haggett and Richard Hogg to find out more. Naturally, there are some things they're not ready to reveal about Flock just yet, but they did tell me that you'll start on top of a mountain and will be wending your way down it with your flock of sheep. \nRead more",

Haha, that's a joke: you don't have a choice. As I said, you're locked in here unless you can find the Resident Evil-ass key I have hidden in here somewhere.

Almost nothing matches the feeling of creatively using all of your abilities to find a scrappy and sometimes unintentionally hilarious solution. Enter Mosa Lina, a pixel platformer that calls itself a “hostile interpretation of the immersive sim, where nothing is planned, and everything works.” Unpredictability is what the game prides itself on and “hostile” is definitely not an understatement based on the embedded developer tweet below.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Ruinarch is based on a concept many of you have thought of at some point. What if, instead of building up villages and hunting down hostile monsters and evil overlords, you were playing as the Dark Lord?\nIt's been done most famously in Dungeon Keeper or Overlord, but those were quite conventional structurally. Sure, you were playing as the baddies, but still doing mostly the same things as in other games, twirling your moustache the whole time. Ruinarch feels not like one of those thematic remixes of an established structure, but an attempt to build a new subgenre. Now that it's reached a full release, it also, sadly, feels like a demonstration of how difficult that really is.\nRead more",

Off the back of the trip, I've finally decided to get my act together and pursue a long, arduous road to some degree of fluency. It's always going to be a work-in-progress, but I think I've settled into a language learning routine which leaves me with plenty of time for Love Island in the evening. DuoLingo's owl has been punted to the curb, too, because the bird is awful.\nNaturally, I've turned to a textbook: Genki I. At first I thought there was no getting past it being a bit dry - I mean they aren't meant to be thrillers, are they? Until, that was, I discovered Game Gengo, a YouTuber who takes each lesson from the textbook, breaks them down into manageable chunks, all complete with loads of examples from video games.

And what's the deal with these newfound powers he has to turn back time and manipulate inanimate objects in his vicinity? That definitely wasn't in the ghostbusting 101 manual. Alas, he doesn't have long to find out, as he'll cross over to the afterlife in the morning.

Last week the temperature in the UK was (pardon my french) bonkers boiling. As we are professionals we recorded this episode with all of our windows closed and our fans turned off in order to avoid any unwanted background noise. Choosing to do this while sat in a British house during a heatwave actually violates several human rights laws, and we've all since been arrested for crimes against ourselves.\nOh, we also talk about our favourite indies from this year's Not-E3, which probably highlights the slight time delay more than the heat thing because in video game industry terms Not-E3 may as well have taken place 30 years ago. But listen, indie games are always relevant, aren't they? Plus I got to do a bit where I pretended to be a games executive in the intro so as far as I'm concerned it all worked out well in the end.\nListen and subscribe via your podcast provider of choice!

Well, I thought that until I played The Password Game, a free game you can play in your web browser. You simply need to pick a password which meets its rules, but it keeps introducing more and more which become sillier and sillier. It's a good joke and grows into quite a tricky puzzle game too. Plus it's free!\nRead more",

Unsurprisingly, these monitors also cost a huge amount of money, with even lower-end options in the £600+ range and higher-end examples in the quadruple figures. \nTwo or three years on, things have settled down and these HDMI 2.1 monitors are now much more affordable - if not yet exactly cheap. One such example is the Acer Nitro XV282KKV, a 28-inch monitor with a 4K 144Hz refresh rate on PC, that's down to £409.98 plus £5 shipping at Ebuyer. That's nearly £200 off its UK RRP and an awesome deal for a monitor with these specs. \nRead more",

So I was happy to give them just a little bit more coverage on his podcast, even if I stumbled over my words more than Joe Biden stumbles up the stairs.

          "description": "Chugging along\nAltfuture has dropped the biggest update yet for their train simulator, Derail Valley. This update overhauls quite a bit, so the developer is treating it as a bit of a relaunch, titling the update Derail Valley: Simulator. That sounds horrifying.\nRemember Derail Valley? I've heard of it, but it’s hard to pick something out among the many train simulators on PC. It started out as a very VR-focused title before offering non-VR options. Most notably, it doesn’t sound like the Early Access launch was very successful. This is the second time the game has been overhauled. The last time was actually titled Overhaul.\nhttps://youtu.be/Htm2HD91Lmk\nWhy should you pay attention? Derail Valley isn’t just a train simulator. Whereas your typical train sim will cast you as the train itself, Derail Valley has you play as a person driving a train. So, you can get in and out, which is necessary to actually do tasks outside the locomotive itself. There’s a lot of tactile gameplay mixed in, possibly as a result of its original VR focus.\nThe Simulator update brings with it a complete redo of the UI, mouse cursor driving, new camera angles, a sandbox mode, more trains, steam simulation, weather effects, and… Just, a lot. Here are the patch notes to get a better idea.\nNow I just need to know if I can play it with my Densha De Go 64 controller.\nDerail Valley is currently in Steam Early Access for PC. The Simulator update is available now.\nThe post Train sim Derail Valley gets overhauled in big Simulator update appeared first on Destructoid.",

The GPU section in particular is intriguing, showing that over 90% of gamers are using DirectX 12 hardware.

The anticipated reboot of Saints Row was a huge let-down for many. But among all these was BlueTwelve Studio's Stray, a dystopian-looking adventure game that lets you control a cat lost in the city.\nIt was very well-received (in fact, we nominated it for Best PlayStation Game of 2022, putting it up against such titans as Elden Ring and God of War: Ragnarok), so you Xbox owners might be interested to know that Stray is coming to Series X/S on August 10. This information was revealed at the recent showcase for Annapurna Interactive, the publisher behind the game.\nhttps://twitter.com/Xbox/status/1674559605471412225\nWhile we were pretty certain that Stray would be coming to Xbox, it's nice that it's finally been confirmed. What's interesting about this announcement is that it's also coming to Xbox One, so if you're still on previous-gen consoles, you're in luck.\nCuriosity...did something to the cat\nIn an era of remasters, remakes, reboots, sequels, and prequels, the likes of Stray provide something a little different. I mean, who among us wouldn't want the chance to take control of a cat on an exciting (if somewhat gritty) adventure?\nWhen it launched last year, it was available on PC and PlayStation, so a lot of you Xbox users out there were probably hoping you'd get to play it at some point. The fact that the game hasn't been in the public eye much this year (if at all) means that this Xbox announcement could renew interest across the board.\nSo, just to reiterate: Stray will be available on the Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One this August 10.\nThe post Cat game Stray is coming to Xbox on August 10 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Daedalic is closing its internal Hamburg studio, which developed Gollum, and canceled a second project based on The Lord of the Rings IP.\nGames Wirtschaft's report indicates 25 employees will be affected. In a statement to Polygon, Daedalic says it will support those former employees in \"finding new opportunities\" within its network. Additionally, Daedalic says it will continue to work on a patch for Gollum, which was released in May. The publisher confirms that the stealth-action game \"did not live up to the expectations\" it had for Gollum.\nMy precious\nThere's no hiding that The Lord of the Rings: Gollum was a massive flop. It sits at a rare 37 on OpenCritic, with only 4% of critics recommending it. As Will Cruz writes for our sister site, The Escapist: \"The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is quite possibly the worst game I've played in 2023 so far.\"\nHaving played a demo of it a while back and walking away baffled, I'm not terribly surprised. Regardless of Gollum's quality, though, seeing developers fall on hard times is never a good thing. Hopefully, those affected can find a new path forward in the industry.\nAs for Lord of the Rings video games, well, this seems to have salted the earth on Gollum. It feels like it's been a bit since we saw the last great LOTR game. Return to Moria is currently set for a fall 2023 release date, so maybe that can rattle the dust off the series a bit.\nThe post The Lord of the Rings: Gollum studio Daedalic is shuttering internal development appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Another Diablo 4 developer update livestream\nMark your calendar. Blizzard has set the date for the next Diablo 4 developer livestream: July 6th at 11AM PST. The stream will feature Lead Game Producer Timothy Ismay and Associate Game Director Joe Piepiora as they detail some upcoming quality-of-life updates and officially announce Season 1 of Diablo 4.\nApparently Diablo Immortal will also make an appearance in the stream to discuss a new class coming mid-July. This is a bit strange as the two games certainly don't share the same player base, even if they are both Diablo games. Either way, you can catch the dual livestream on the official Diablo Twitch channel.\nhttps://twitter.com/Diablo/status/1674826164995604484\nQuality-of-life and Season 1 details are coming for Diablo 4\nI have to admit, Blizzard's handling of Diablo 4 post-release has been pretty spectacular so far. The recent patch 1.03 we received on June 27th fixed a lot of bugs, provided a ton of class balance changes, and added a ton of quality-of-life (QoL) features to the game. Experience gains have increased all over the game, and Nightmare Dungeons are more rewarding to run. With quality-of-life updates being a focus of the livestream, I imagine we'll see even more improvements on the way.\nMore importantly, Season 1 information is on the way. Executive Producer Rod Fergusson already confirmed we'd be getting the release date next week, which will probably be in this livestream. Furthermore, I think we'll get some details on the new features and content coming in the first season. This will probably include details about the Season 1 battle pass. Unfortunately, we know there will be no leaderboards just yet.\nIf you're interested be sure to check out the Diablo 4 developer update livestream on July 6th at 11AM PST.\nThe post Don’t miss the Diablo 4 developer livestream on July 6th appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A \"bit\" of news\nFirst launched by Choice Provisions (formerly known as Gaijin Games) in 2009, the Bit.Trip series has endured a lot. The fact that it's still standing after getting its start on the much-maligned (but beautifully scored) WiiWare service almost 15 years ago proves that it has legs. Now those legs are moving into the maker space with Bit.Trip Rerunner; a brand new title in the franchise.\nOriginally there were six games in the Bit.Trip story (Beat, Core, Void, Runner, Fate and Flux), but then Runner really took off, inspiring two numbered sequels and one free mobile spin-off. Both of which featured Charles Martinet (best known for voicing Mario) in a prominent role. So in a roundabout way, it makes sense for the Bit.Trip Runner subseries to continue to follow in Mario's footsteps with this new \"Maker\" title.\nDetails are scant, but the Choice Provisions Twitter page tells us that Rerunner will have \"Over 150 new levels, each with increasing challenges\", a new \"Runner-Maker tool to create and share your own levels\" and \"gameplay mechanics inspired by the original Bit.Trip games\".\nThe feature I think most Bit.Trip fans will want to see is the option to play with the original voxel visual style. Mario Maker definitely spoiled us by giving us Mario 1, 3, World, and \"New\" modes to play with. Unbeknownst to many, the Bit.Trip Runner series has used five distinctly different visual styles in past games as well (voxel, Atari 2600-style flat sprites, NES-style sprites,  2D drawings, and rounded polygons), so the options are already there.\nWe may find out if Rerunner will rerun all four of those looks when we see the game in action!\nThe post Bit.Trip makes a comeback with Bit.Trip Rerunner appeared first on Destructoid.",

Of course, the next stage of that campaign: My Nintendo swag!\nAs you may recall, Nintendo celebrated the re-release Pikmin 3 in 2020 with a sticker and coaster set. Well, in a recent news post on the My Nintendo site, the publisher confirmed that there will be a sticker set coming in the future for Pikmin 4. Here's the full rundown from Nintendo:\n\"Add some cuteness to your smooth surfaces with these lovely 3” x 3” stickers! One features a Blue Pikmin, a Yellow Pikmin, and a Red Pikmin ready for whatever’s next. The other shows an explorer and a squad of Pikmin riding on the back of space dog Oatchi.\"\n\nGiven the timeframe of prior announcements, it could be anywhere between 1-2 weeks until we see the set go up on the My Nintendo storefront. Expect the price to be in line with prior sticker sets on the service, ranging from 300-500 Platinum Points.\nThere's also a Pikmin 4 demo promo for free Platinum\nIn other My Nintendo news, there's a Pikmin 4 retailer demo promo going on soon, which can net you 200 Platinum Points.\nAll you need to do is play the demo of the game at select retailers, then scan a QR code at the end. That's it! This particular gimmick will be running from July 7 through October 19, so you have plenty of time.

His parents did nothing, he says. They just laughed.\nDecades later, he found himself trying to re- create the experience in Silent Hill: Shattered Memories.\nNowadays, Barlow is known for making Her Story and founding the studio Half Mermaid, developer of Telling Lies and Immortality. In 2009, however, he was working at Climax Studios on Silent Hill and became obsessed with making characters slightly hairy and having them run on all fours. Simultaneously, he had the teamʼs level designers build a segment where youʼd run through a swimming pool. Read more...",

While wearing a Yoshi costume, no less.\n“The head was vacuum-formed, but Yoshi’s whole body was solid foam,” adds Kathy Lawrence, the costume designer responsible for creating the mascots for dozens of Nintendo’s TV spots in the ʼ90s and 2000s.\n“It went from a costume that weighed about 35 pounds to over 200 pounds,” Fireball says. “The foam, like a sponge, just absorbed the water, and I just started to sink.” Mistaking his outreached hand for a thumbs up, Kathy and the crew were excited as they watched her husband fight for his life underwater.

          "description": "If Ubisoft's summer showcase was any indication, it's going all-in on Assassin's Creed. But a recent report from Kotaku suggests that the company's commitment to the franchise might be going even deeper than we thought; Ubisoft has recently begun the process of remaking Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. \nThe remake is currently in \"its earliest stages,\" Kotaku reports, so details are scarce, and we won't be seeing it officially for a few years. A team at Ubisoft Singapore, a branch that has contributed to almost every mainline Assassin's Creed game, is said to be heavily involved. Most notably, Ubisoft Singapore worked on the creation of naval combat for Assassin's Creed III and IV, a success that would place it at the head of development for Ubisoft's naval-focused game, Skull and Bones. Of course, Skull and Bones is now notorious for its years of repeated delays – fans of Black Flag will just have to hope the seas will be calmer for the studio's next project.\n\n\nBlack Flag was released in 2013 on the eve of a new console generation, coming to PS3 and 360, but also to PS4, Xbox One, and Wii U. The game follows Edward Kenway – the pirate grandfather of the protagonist Connor from Assassin's Creed III – as he plunders the Caribbean and stumbles into the Assassin Brotherhood. Combining the series' classic stealth gameplay with naval exploration and combat, it's widely regarded as one of the franchise's best entries. Check out our review here.\n[Source: Kotaku]\nAre you interested in a remake of Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag? Let us know in the comments!",

Instead, the acronym is confusingly shorthand for Reach for the Moon.

The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey. \nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

          "description": "Annapurna Interactive has revealed Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth, a new game set in the same world as the Blade Runner film series, and it's the first game developed in-house. \nAnnapurna has published plenty of great games, but it announced last year that it had created a new internal studio to actually develop one. And now we know that game is Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth. As the name suggests, it takes place in 2033, which puts it between the original film and its sequel, Blade Runner 2049. Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth takes place in a dystopian Los Angeles like its cinematic predecessors, and the game's events occur after the Blackout hits. \nNot much else was revealed about the game, but you can check out its moody cinematic trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, this game looks very Blade Runner, and we can't wait to learn more about it. Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth's development is led by game director Chelsea Hash, who previously served as the director of Solar Ash and technical art lead on What Remains of Edith Finch. \nAnnapurna Interactive says Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth is the first new Blade Runner game for consoles and PC in development in 25 years. It's due out sometime in the future on consoles and PC, but there's no word on when to expect it. However, Annapurna Interactive says it will share more details about the game soon. \nAre you excited about this reveal? Let us know in the comments below!",

It looks great – we quite enjoyed playing it recently during Summer Game Fest 2023 – and you can check it out for yourself below in the newest Thirsty Suitors trailer: \n\n\nAs you can see, players take on the role of protagonist Jala, who, after a bad breakup, returns to her hometown. There, she must confront her exes and try to reconcile with them, please her tough-to-please parents, and mend broken friendships in time for her sister's wedding. To do all that, Jala will skateboard, take part in turn-based combat seemingly inspired by Persona and Pokémon, cook meals with her parents, and more. \nThirsty Suitors hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC via Steam on November 2. \nAre you going to check out Thirsty Suitors this November?

Ever since 2004, EA Sports' annualized Madden NFL series has been the exclusive franchise for the NFL, its teams, stadiums, and players. The result was the closure of other franchises, such as the competitive NFL 2K series, as well as the arcade-focused NFL Blitz franchise (which was later acquired by EA in 2011). The recently announced Wild Card Football from Saber Interactive, part of the Playgrounds franchise, hopes to smash through the established line to give players a fresh 7-on-7 arcade-facing take on the sport starring their favorite players.\nWild Card Football doesn't possess the NFL license, but rather the NFLPA license.

          "description": "While game delays have become commonplace, the opposite is extremely rare. Today, we learned Baldur's Gate 3 is somehow doing both at the same time. Initially planned for August 31, developer Larian Studios is advancing the PC release date to August 3 while delaying the PS5 version to September 6. According to the most recent community update, the change was done to prioritize release in order of platform readiness. More specifically, the team needed a little more time to get the PS5 version up to 60 frames per second.\n\"The PlayStation 5 version will be released roughly a week later than its originally scheduled date of August 31st,\" the community update reads. \"Baldur’s Gate 3 is targeting 60 frames-per-second and we’re close to achieving that on the platform but need a bit more extra time. We don’t want to compromise on quality, and feel it would be a shame to downscale to 30fps or make other compromises to hit an arbitrary date.\"\nMeanwhile, the PC version has moved up a whopping four weeks. Larian says, \"This means the PC version of Baldur’s Gate 3 will be released at a time where you’ll have more time to play it,\" likely in reference to the release of Starfield, Bethesda's massive upcoming open-world RPG. By releasing their game over a month earlier, it's a little less likely that gamers would have to choose one or the other to devote their time to.\nThe community update also casts a light cantrip on some of the features coming to the full game, including new spells, the addition of feats, the Half-Orc and Dragonborn races, the monk class, and a huge line-up of new subclasses, which you can see listed below.\nFor more Baldur's Gate 3, check out its Summer Game Fest trailer that revealed Jason Issacs' role in the game.",

While it makes the world more believable, it can be incredibly disorienting for an audience to be thrust headfirst into a sea of unfamiliar proper nouns, especially before they have a chance to get to know the world's characters.

You'll also get to watch those kombatants team up with three Kameo fighters: Kano, Sonya, and Jax. \n\n\nFor more previews and discussions of some of the biggest games of 2023 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about new and upcoming games such as Eternights, Crash Team Rumble, XDefiant, and Sea of Stars.",

          "description": "Publisher Humble Games and developer Crema have revealed Temtem Showdown, a new standalone battle-focused game, and it's out right now. \nThis surprise reveal comes less than a year after the full 1.0 release of Temtem, the game that Showdown is based on. Similar to Pokemon Showdown, Temtem Showdown is all about battling. It's also free to everyone. \n\"Temtem Showdown takes the best Temtem competitive action and places it within immediate reach for everyone,\" a press release reads. \"Get to know the colorful critters from the massively multiplayer creature-collection adventure, build your team in seconds, and dash into battle to test it out against other players and their teams – or carefully curate a plan of action to overpower your opponents.\" \nUnlike Temtem, which is a multiplayer Pokemon-like game where you catch and train Temtem to use in 2 vs. 2 battles, Showdown will let players build a team from scratch right from the jump. And then you can hop right into a battle, without needing to worry about their level like you might in the base game. You can play against other players both casually and competitively, and the latter will feature a ranked system and a ladder to climb up as you play. \nCrema says Showdown will receive regular balance patches to keep the meta fair, and new Seasons will bring additional content and changes as well. \nFor more, read our thoughts on the base game in Game Informer's Temtem review.",

          "description": "Bethesda's Indiana Jones game, which is currently being developed by Wolfenstein developer Machine Games, will be exclusive to Xbox. \nThis news comes from an ongoing court trial between the Federal Trade Commission and Xbox (and Activision Blizzard, which Microsoft is trying to acquire) happening today, which is where Bethesda's Head of Publishing Pete Hines revealed the game will be a console exclusive on Xbox, as reported by IGN. Like Xbox's other first-party releases, Machine Games' Indiana Jones game will also come to PC. \nHowever, Hines also revealed that Disney and Bethesda parent company ZeniMax originally signed an agreement that this Indiana Jones game would be multiplatform, meaning it'd likely also release on PlayStation. Hines says after Microsoft acquired ZeniMax in 2020, the agreement with Disney was amended to transition the Indiana Jones game away from a multiplatform release and instead, into one that will release exclusively on Xbox and PC.\n\n\nToday's court trial also revealed that Xbox head Phil Spencer told Hines that Bethesda should look at title exclusivity on a case-by-case basis, IGN reports. As for why Indiana Jones was transitioned into an exclusive, Hines cited \"reducing risk and trying to get a degree of clarity.\" \n\"You're dealing with a licensor who is giving a ton of feedback on what you're making, is going to add a ton of time to your scheduling, these agreements, you don't get to take as long as you want, you have a window of time in which you're going to release a game, you immediately have a clock that's ticking on you,\" Hines said, according to IGN.\nBethesda revealed Machine Games' Indiana Jones game back in 2021 with a short teaser trailer, and that was the last we've seen of it. However, Bethesda head Todd Howard says he first pitched this Indiana Jones game way back in 2009. There's still no release window for the game today. \n[Source: IGN]\nEditor's Note: The headline has been updated to reflect the game will also come to PC.",

At the very least, remakes offer a great way to play antiquated or less accessible experiences on modern hardware. \nThe remake boom has been in full swing in recent years to the point that it’s starting to get tough to keep track of all the projects in the works.

          "description": "A stalwart party exploring the unknown, seeking the fabled Inner Sanctum. But all is not what it seems in the world of Varn...\nThe ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for the PC version of the first game of the Might and Magic series: Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Two modes are supported:\nThe original look and feel of the game (sound, which in the original consisted of merely the occasional beep, is not supported)\nA ScummVM-exclusive enhanced mode, which uses the interface of the later Xeen games, including niceties such as better character screens, automapping, and sound effects. It also integrates the impressive \"Might and Magic 1 Graphics Overhaul Mod\", which provides better in-game map and monster graphics. The xeen.cc file is required from Might and Magic: IV or Might and Magic: World of Xeen.\nBoth modes allow saving your game anywhere outside of combat via the ScummVM Global Main Menu (unlike the original game that only saved a single roster when checking into an inn). So make sure you save regularly, just in case you encounter problems.\nHelp us test both game modes by grabbing a daily build and adding mm.dat to the same folder as your game files. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way.\nNow, go forth, and discover the true secrets of the game that started the long running epic fantasy series!\n>",

          "description": "As I write this many of the development team and other members of the community are busy having fun at a meet-up in Brussels. Not me though, I’m stuck here doing a release. We’ve been busy refactoring quite a lot of the underlying code to make future changes easier, but along the way we’ve found and fixed a few more bugs and quality of life improvements that we figured were worth releasing sooner than whenever 14.0 comes along. Notably, OpenTTD will now automatically disable hardware acceleration if it detects that the last crash happened while initialising the graphics driver. While hardware acceleration works well for the vast majority of people, it causes crashes for people that then required command line arguments or manual config file editing to get it to work. This should be a better solution for those users. Additionally, there is a change to the default mouse mode on Linux to improve experience when dragging the map (and often to match expected behaviour in other games). As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. While you’re at it, have you seen the post about the upcoming addition of a automated opt-in survey to OpenTTD 14? If you have opinions, we’d like to hear them! Details here. Download Changelog Bug tracker",
