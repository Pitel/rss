          "description": "In the past week, quite a few Elden Ring players have suffered problems with save files on Steam. They weren't being synced properly online with the Steam Cloud, which led to Steam asking whether they wanted to use the cloud save or local save. This question spooked some, leading them to choose poorly and end up with an old save, missing maybe hours of progress. Oh no. That ssshould be fixed now, by a Steam patch Valve released on Friday. But do be cautious if you're asked.\nRead more",

I've said before I've never been much of a Soulsite, and it's not for lack of trying. I tried my darnedest to get into Dark Souls III when it first came out, but holy deathrattles, it was such a long, gruelling slog. Vordt of the Boreal Valley, the second (yes, second) boss of Dark Souls III, remains my lifelong nemesis. I just couldn't get past it. I'm someone who always likes to be making forward, tangible progress when I play games, and banging my head against the same boss for hours on end is my idea of actual hell.\nI'm no better at playing Elden Ring, to be honest. I spent a good couple of hours last night just trying to get past one of those big tentacle-beard monkey lads with the hollowed out stomachs on the way up to Stormveil Castle. Not even a named, actual sub-boss! And yet, I'm actually enjoying this version of Souls-style head-bashing a lot more than I've ever done before.

While the MSI GeForce RTX 3050 Gaming X 8G model I’ve tested has already ballooned to £380 / $450, this leaves it looking like much more of a  genuine alternative to RTX 3060, which is generally around £500 in the UK. And while it’s ultimately still a 1080p specialist, the RTX 3050 takes a big step up from previous GTX XX50 GPUs by offering DLSS and ray tracing support.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Aside from the teensiest glimpses of what could've been, the game is a bemusing cascade of loot and stats that don't mean all that much. The combat has its moments but is largely bleh. The story is meh. And it's all yours for £60 - heh?!\nRead more",

If there's no outpouring of questionable illustration following the debut of your single-sentence plot-helper, then you've either failed at fiction or you are deeply blessed. Some breakaway characters begin as a joke, or an afterthought, some as a narrative necessity, or a kind of walking, talking environment art. Others are born as side characters to lighten the story because the main dudes frown too much and Derek from market research says frowns are \"cringe\". Well, shut up, Derek. You're cringe.

The train really gets derailed early as we start talking about Elden Ring, and thus, naturally, what bit of Matthew a king would steal for said king's own body? (The answer is Matthew's nice soft hair). We hear more about Nate's orc/goblin dolls house too, of course, and at certain points in the podcast do manage to drag things back round to talking about the actual topic of the podcast.

          "description": "The Ziggurat is an imposing presence in the lakeside hub town of Babylon’s Fall, its broad, horizon-spanning arches giving away nothing about the kind of fantastical beasts and secrets you’ll find inside. Based on the Tower Of Babel, the mythological birthplace of all the world’s languages, it’s perhaps ironic that Square Enix and PlatinumGames’ latest hack and slash started life with its own kind of miscommunication. When it was first unveiled at E3 2018, it looked like PlatinumGames were doubling down on all the good stuff they’d delivered just a year earlier with Nier: Automata, giving us another high-octane, single player action game with a dizzying array of weapons and over the top soundtrack, all wrapped up in an enticing layer of gothic high fantasy as players fight their way skyward. \nA long silence then followed, release dates slipped again and again, and its single follow-up trailer during one of Sony's 2019 State Of Play broadcasts remained as inscrutable as its iconic Ziggurat. It wasn’t until E3 2021 that the game’s true nature was finally revealed. Rather than being a solo adventure, Platinum and Square declared that not only would Babylon’s Fall be a primarily online multiplayer game, but that it was also going to be a live service game in the vein of Destiny and The Division. It was surprising, to say the least, but when I put the question to the PlatinumGames and Square Enix’s joint development team, Square Enix producer Junichi Ehara tells me that this was far from a sudden change of heart on their part: “From the very start of the project, it was decided that Babylon’s Fall would include the elements of high fantasy, hack-and-slash, and live service.” \nRead more",

Nail-biting combat, intricate worlds, a story that's drip-fed through it all. But it's the littlest bits that round off their identity. The dong of their menu sounds (I love a good menu noise) and their elevators operated by pressure plates.\nThere's also one other big thing that Soulsborne games deliver on. As any seasoned player knows, it's not a FromSoft game without the laughs. While there's plenty of humour in the cliff falls and silly invasions, I'm talking in a more literal sense. The NPCs often round off their sentences with a chuckle. But so far, Elden Ring lacks the despairing \"hahaha\" of old. And it makes me sad.\nRead more",

That’s according to Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais, who spoke to us at length on the making of the Deck and its future prospects.\r\n\n\r\nValve have previously made the peculiar move of showing exactly how to open a Steam Deck and remove individual parts, complete with video, while simultaneously declaring it something owners should refrain from. On pain of borking components, personal injury, and even death, apparently.\r\n\n \nRead more",

You are Vix (vikfikfok), an fox wot fixes things in a distant future, where humans started to gene-splice themselves with animals for the convenience of having, for example, lovely warm fur. This is a step I would 100% take; even as I write this in the office I am wrapped in a blanket I brought in from home, and my fingers are still cold. I would be less able to repair things using bits of tape and coins I found in holes in the ground, but then I am not a mechanic.\nVix is a mechanic, although they are laughed at by their compatriots for being quite a bad one. They have a sentient tool box called Tin, but misadventure means all Vix's conventional tools are lost. In the course of a pretty meaty preview build I got to explore a strange, cuboid planet, top-down stylee, and repair things for a buncha robots. But there are loads of other aspects to FixFox - a preoccupation with food, a kind of space-sokoban game, a story that hints at mystery and evolution and time. Part puzzle game, part sci-fi adventure, part fok.\nRead more",

If I'd had my act together, I could have used this letter to give you a glimpse of all the exciting things we've just done - things like our freshly-concluded Souls Week, or all the neat Steam Next Fest bits we had planned, and (maybe) even a sneaky peek at all the excellent Steam Deck stuff we've written about as well. Alas, my time management skills have been a bit of a dumpster fire this month - although if you haven't checked out everything I've just mentioned, please do go and have a read. The RPS team have been very busy bees this month, and it would be a shame to miss out on all the great stuff going on.  \nOf course, the question now becomes, how do we carry on this kind of momentum when literally nothing has a confirmed release date past the end of March?

Elden Ring is, of course, much better than sick at any temperature, obviously - I'm just saying that so far, I have not found it to be much easier or less opaque than any other FromSoft game, except it has clearer tooltips and sometimes an NPC will say, \"You should do this thing.\" In fact, the open world - the thing that people say is the most good bit - is having the opposite effect on me.\nRead more",

I immediately made a beeline for the concert venue and was treated to a rather unflattering rendering of Billy Idol and his guitar-playing chum performing a song. (Whiskey & Pills from his 2014 album, rather than anything you’re likely to have heard.) After the cutscene, you’re left in the empty amphitheatre, alone apart from a couple of guys talking about how great the concert was.\r\n\n\r\nThere is no context for this cameo. Billiam doesn’t feature as an NPC. In the 40-ish hours I spent playing the game, I had no reason to return to the amphitheatre. It makes no sense whatsoever and the only explanation I can come up with is that someone involved in the game really likes Billy Idol and just wanted him in their game. It’s the sort of random that I can respect, and I only wish the game had more.\r\n\n \nRead more",

When you look into the bucket, you find sand, paint, bread, pottery, chocolate, nails, and several crabs all speaking different languages. Isn't this fascinating? What the hell is going on? This is Hero's Hour, an untidy RTS sand bucket filled with so many ideas it's hard to see how this turbulent mix will have any structural integrity at all when you finally up-end the bucket to build a tower. And yet… it sorta does? I don't know. I'm lost. How do I get off this beach?\nRead more",

A man who invents successive tales of fantasy in an effort to stay his likely execution by an impatient general interrogating him in a dark room. Ivan is the little guy in every sense, small in stature, a hunching underdog to forces beyond his control. As the likeable hero of Little Orpheus, a vibrant modernising of the cinematic platformer, he builds a rapport with the general that carries the game as best it can through eight beautiful but ultimately formulaic levels. This is a light game, unchallenging by design, and for me, sleepily so. \nRead more",

          "description": "Shadow Warrior 3 continues the series tradition of completely rebooting the style of each game. This time it’s going for a more linear arena shooter style, similar to 2013's Shadow Warrior, and it’s got generally the right idea. You play as the former freelance mercenary Lo Wang, and mainly just try to get from A to B. This means jumping through hand-crafted levels, and generally shooting and slicing your way through the various demonic mobs and mini-bosses that spawn in front of you. Whenever you’re not clearing out enemies in an arena setting, you’ll be parkouring between them, or using your skills to navigate some setpieces. That's basically it, that's the game.\nRead more",

If it's anything like ginger puss cat Tiger in Jeremy \"Aviary Attorney\" Noghani's turn-based RPG Small Saga, they're going to be in trouble, as these rodents come bearing switchblades and cigarette lighters to fend off their deadly foes. It's an intriguing take on the classic Final Fantasy-like job types of other RPGs - the switchblade is to protagonist Verm what Cloud's Buster Sword is to a regular human, while Siobhan's lighter allows her to cast fire 'magic' as the party's mage - and based on its hour-long Steam Next Fest demo, it's shaping up to be just as grand a tale as its lauded genre mates. \nRead more",

Some didn’t get on with SteamOS’s Proton compatibility software, and others needed a bit more work on the ol’ anti-cheat, but I wouldn’t be surprised if most Steam games end up rated as Verified or Playable in Valve’s compatibility review programme.\nWhat, then, are some of the very best games to play on the Steam Deck? Personally I’ve most enjoyed the ones designed with thumbstick controls in mind (like Horizon Zero Dawn and Death’s Door) but since I was interviewing Gabe Newell and members of the Deck dev team in the run-up to the Steam Deck's launch today, I took the chance to ask them if they had any suggestions. Here's what they've been playing.\nRead more",

          "description": "From Ubisoft to Konami to the Epic Games Store, games companies are doubling down on NFTs as fast as others are backtracking on them. Valve, on the other hand, aren’t likely to get involved any time soon, owing to “a lot of criminal activity and a lot of sketchy behaviours”. That’s according to co-founder Gabe Newell, who recently spoke to us about his concerns around crypto.\r\n\n\r\nWhile indie game store Itch.io declared NFTs a scam, Newell is more open to the “underlying technology of distributed ledgers” – but says there are just too many bad actors using that technology for nefarious endeavours, namely fraud and money laundering. Steam banned games with NFTs and cryptocurrency last year.\r\n\n \nRead more",

A few minutes into playing on this – the first serious attempt at a handheld PC from a major gaming entity - and I am once more a child, alternating between sinking into the sofa to redirect energy into my thumbs and wanting desperately to rush round my friends’ houses to show them the cool new thing. \r\n\n\r\nNot that the Steam Deck is a nostalgia exercise, given it’s built to run the very latest AAA games as much as it is indies and retros. And it certainly isn’t twee: from its no-nonsense, all-black design to the performance-tweaking options in its OS, the Deck is a serious device, even and especially when it’s serious about giving you a good time. That’s in spite of some imperfections, to be sure – the software, screen and battery life may disappoint anyone expecting another top-end Valve hardware masterclass to follow their Index virtual reality headset. But the Steam Deck is more accessible, more affordable, and far more useful to have on a train.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The consolidation of the games industry – that is, games companies being bought up and absorbed by bigger games companies – has been increasing, intensifying, and giving poor Ed the aches. Exhibited most dramatically by Microsoft stumping up $69 billion for Activision Blizzard, this trend towards conglomerification has raised worries about both creative expression and the potential locking-down of more games to certain platforms.\nValve president and co-founder Gabe Newell is no stranger to making some additions. Valve famously hired the student developers of Narbacular Drop to work on what eventually became Portal, and acquired Firewatch developers Campo Santo in 2018. In our recent interview, I asked him whether he thought consolidation could be a problem for the industry going forwards.\nRead more",

Some of that comes down to their many systems frying my little brain, but Onbu has me persevering. Why? Because the resources I'm harvesting and community I'm building help or hinder Onbu.

Mention a harrier anywhere outside of an ornithology summit and people will assume you’re talking about the hovering aeroplane rather than the diurnal hawk. Tell somebody your harrier is hungry and they’re as likely to chuck a vole into a turbine as they are to feed it into your pet bird’s gullet. \r\n\n\r\nSo it’s unsurprising that Tiny Combat Arena is about Harriers of the cold and featherless kind. The one-person dev team behind the air-to-air combat simulator is apparently in love with the floaty-shooty jumping jet, so much so that it’s the only type of plane available to fly in the game's early access release. The retro-styled sim lets you pore over the low-poly plane as it rests in the hangar, to rest your chin in your hands as you lovingly scroll through its various specifications, inspecting its payload like you’re checking a dog over for ticks. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Out I said. Oh – you're still here? Presumably that means you don't care for a spoiler or two. Okay, that works for me.\nI'd like to wax lyrical about a good boss in Elden Ring, if you don't mind. He's a beastman, of sorts, who awaits you at the end of a castle. But more than that, he's an optional challenge that both leaves a lasting impression and doesn't at the same time.\nRead more",

After lingering over the resulting mess of blood, muscle and bulging eyes, you then place your recently drowned identical twin sister’s face over your own. It’s just a dream, but still, this is far from the only time Martha Is Dead insists you do something unspeakable, nor is it even the only time you’re forced to desecrate your sister’s corpse. \r\n\n\r\nApart from poor writing, these excessive, brute force attempts to disturb define Martha Is Dead.

For the most part Martha just made me frown and go “ew”. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Je samozřejmě poněkud sporné, jaký benefit z AVX-512 třeba Tiger Lake bude mít, když integrovaná grafika těchto CPU obsahuje hardwarový AV1 dekodér, ale to nechme stranou.",

Ukážeme vám zajímavé procesory s velmi nízkou cenou, poradíme jak na velice úsporná zařízení běžící na CR2032 a uvidíte i trik, jak kvalitně fotit osazené desky plošných spojů. To všechno ve Virtuální Bastlírně – pravidelném online setkání elektroniků a bastlířů. Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v úterý 8. března od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00. Ať už něco chcete ukázat nebo máte jenom téma k diskuzi, vyplňte prosím dotazník. Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

Confirmed in Piko's Twitter account and a listing on Steam, everyone's favorite hand is back with the return of Glover.\nFinally the wait is almost over. The #N64 Era Cult Classic Glover is coming soon! This version of #Glover is a completely redone from the original source code (N64 version of the game), and improved for modern PCs.#remaster #RETROGAMING #Nintendo64 pic.twitter.com/awbq00ALHr\nMarch 7, 2022\nWith a release date set for April 20 on PC, Piko's port of Glover is said to be \"completely redone\" using the Nintendo 64 version's source code. Complete with six worlds and 30 total stages, players will puzzle their way through Glover by changing the titular character's form and the properties of magic crystals disguised as rubber balls to navigate and clear each level. \nOriginally released in 1998 for Nintendo 64 and PC, with a PlayStation port a year later, Glover was a creation of the Oliver Twins, a duo of prolific British game design brothers who formed the now-defunct Interactive Games. Now, 24 years later, will this new version allow the glove to get the love some think it deserves? We'll know in just over a month.\nAre you excited or surprised by the return of Glover?

This week we're bidding farewell to Nathan Drake by discussing his final adventure in Uncharted 4: A Thief's End.\nReleased on May 10, 2016, Uncharted 4 was a shake-up for the series in more ways than one. Amy Henning, the franchises' primary creative mind, departed Naughty Dog during the game's development, leaving The Last of Us masterminds Neil Druckmann and Bruce Straley to revamp the game's production. Uncharted 4 introduced players to Nate's long-lost brother Sam Drake (who was originally conceived as a more villainous figure) as well as new mechanics such as a grapple hook and even dialogue choices. How did Naughty Dog tie a bow on this beloved franchise? Tune in to find out. \nJoin hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and Game Informer Features Editor Kim Wallace (@kstar1785) as we unpack the history, narrative, and impact of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. \nIf you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

Described by the team as a new “mini-raid” experience, these Sea Forts can be attacked and plundered at any time by yourself or a full crew. Regardless of who’s sailing with you, Rare says the Sea Forts can be completed, so if you’re a solo player, there’s no need to worry that you won’t be able to loot everything within a Sea Forts’ walls. \nClick here to watch embedded media\nAs you can see in the trailer above, the forts look much more formidable than the already-existing forts on the Sea of Thieves. Forts are meant to bring players together, whereas Rare says Sea Forts are meant to provide a personalized challenge to players. \nAnother new feature in Season 6 is the addition of more Pirate Legend Voyages. These are replayable legends that will task you with uncovering treasure by way of new maps, plundering ship graveyards, and more. On top of all this, Rare has released a 2022 timeline that details what to expect in not just Season 6, but Season 7, 8, and 9, which will take players through all of 2022. \nFor more about Sea of Thieves, read about Shrouded Islands, the game’s first adventure released last month, and then check out this story about how Sea of Thieves’ PvP arena is set to shut down this month.\nAre you excited for Season 6 of Sea of Thieves?

Games like Resogun and Nex Machina were homages to zany, psychedelic shoot 'em ups. Returnal, in its own impressive way, builds upon the developer's lineage by offering similar visuals and mechanics wrapped in a 3D, Triple-A skin. Despite the massive success of the sci-fi roguelike – Housemarque was acquired by Sony, after all – the studio is smartly broadening its horizons again. Housemarque is developing a new game, but it won't be Returnal 2. \nIn an award show interview with Venturebeat and an array of other outlets, narrative director Gregory Louden, game director Henry Krueger, and managing director Ilari Kuittinen were asked about the future of Housemarque (among other topics), \"...In a time where games are changing, the people playing them are changing, how do you hold on to [your] identity?\"\nRecently, Sony's pivoted towards a live service methodology, a multiplayer-centric style that Housemarque likely won't employ. That's because the team's already tried it, to middling results:\n\"We had our stint working on multiplayer games, because a few years back it seemed like you needed to have some kind of multiplayer experience. We tried that, and we really didn't do it as well. But it's early days with us starting a new game, a new IP, concepting it out. We'll see what comes with that.\"\nWhat exactly this new IP is remains to be seen, but Kuittinen also briefly mentioned that Nex Machina, \"a shoot-'em-up game in the style of the coin-ops from the 80s,\" might be a clue. It's safe to assume that Housemarque might be working on another large-scope game like Returnal, and it'll be interesting to see how the developer finds ways to mix its arcade roots with a modern, new-gen veneer. \nFor more on Returnal, read our review. \n[Source: Venturebeat]",

We're also actively evaluating related changes to other areas of our games.\" The same goes for the hockey franchise NHL 22 which will be trimmed of its teams representing both Russia and Belarus.\nA statement from EA SPORTS NHL: pic.twitter.com/2uX4h55ok4\nMarch 2, 2022\n\"EA Sports stands in solidarity with the Ukrainian people and like so many voices across the world of football, calls for peace and an end to the invasion of Ukraine,\" reads the FIFA account's announcement with a similar sentiment shared from the EA Sports NHL account. The removal of teams is set to start in the coming weeks. EA has stated that it will provide additional updates on the matter as they become available.",

Those two fruits can be found all over in the Scarlet and Violet reveal trailer, including two plaques flanking a doorway, each featuring an icon representing either an orange or a bushel of grapes.\nIt's a great find from this web sleuth, who also came up with another possible hint in Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl. Seen below, there's a flowerbed in Twinleaf town filled with red and purple flowers, now recognized as the color pair for Scarlet and Violet. DDD-HERO made sure to check the original versions of Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum, finding that the fenced garden initially existed but with less-pronounced flowers of different colors. I'd say this is another hit of a hint!\nNow to find one in Pokémon Legends: Arceus...\nCheck out the reveal of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet right here, and find out which Pokémon are confirmed for the new duo of Switch titles so far.",

I'm currently speeding through the content, but I was slow off the line, so I'm not quite ready to render my final verdict. However, from what I've played, Gran Turismo 7 is everything players should want from a simulation racer. \nMy first impression was just how flat-out gorgeous this game is. Yes, racing games typically are visual showcases, but Gran Turismo 7 is impressive even in a genre that includes the likes of Forza Horizon 5. Each vehicle, track, and environment is meticulously modeled, giving you a true sense of immersion as you drive at blistering speeds. Around every turn, the beauty of Polyphony Digital's work is unavoidable.\nUnlike Forza Horizon 5, Gran Turismo 7 is a sim racer that takes place on closed tracks. That means you won't be exploring a vast, open world or launching yourself off ramps, but there is plenty of fun to be had. Whether you're competing in white-knuckled races over the course of several laps, completing activities to satisfy special missions, or racking up mileage in special time trials set to musical playlists, Gran Turismo 7 offers a diverse set of content. Not only that, but it appeals heavily to the collector in me, continually encouraging me to build as robust a garage of vehicles as I can.\nGran Turismo 3: A-Spec captivated me more than two decades ago and was perhaps the most-played game on my PlayStation 2. The series hasn't held my attention to that extent in the time since, but even in my early stages, I can feel Gran Turismo 7 begin to sink its hooks in me. Only time will tell if this game will steal hours upon hours from me the way Gran Turismo 3 did, but so far, I'm having a great time with the latest from Polyphony Digital.",

Of course, there are all kinds of new loot to be had as well, so that should have cleaners crawling back to camp to take on these new threats.

Capcom doesn’t specify what that means but one would assume the games will hit at least 60 fps since that’s the benchmark for current-gen titles. The PS5 versions feature Dual Sense haptic feedback and adaptive trigger support as well. \nBest of all, if you already own these games on last-gen consoles you’ll get a free upgrade to the new versions (with Smart Delivery on Xbox). A free upgrade patch is also coming to the PC versions. There’s no release date for these re-releases but expect them in 2022. \nResident Evil 7 Biohazard launched in 2017 and was hailed as a return to form for the series, shifting the perspective to first-person and getting back to the franchise’s survival horror roots. Its direct sequel, Resident Evil Village, arrived in 2021. The remakes of Resident Evil 2 and 3 were similarly celebrated as smart reimaginings of the PS1 classics, reinventing them using Resident Evil 4’s over-the-shoulder gameplay. \nTo learn more, be sure to check out our reviews for each title:\nResident Evil 7: Biohazard Review\nResident Evil 2 Review\nResident Evil 3 Review",

A full list can be found on the Crunchyroll site, but here are some of the shows now available for Crunchyroll viewers:\nAttack on Titan: Junior High (Sub and Dub)\nBlack Clover ep. 1–170 (Dub)\nCowboy Bebop (Sub and Dub)\nDarling in the Franxx (Dub)\nDr. Stone seasons 1 and 2 (Dub)\nFire Force seasons 1 and 2 (Dub)\nFruits Basket seasons 1-3 (Dub)\nHunter x Hunter ep. 1–74 (Dub)\nMy Hero Academia seasons 1–5 (Dub)\nScarlet Nexus (Dub)\nSk8 the Infinity (Sub and Dub)\nThat Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime seasons 1 and 2 and OADs (Dub)\nTokyo Ghoul (Dub)\nYu Yu Hakusho ep. 1-112 and OVAs (Sub and Dub)\nYuri!!! on Ice (Dub)\nStarting with the upcoming spring season for anime, Crunchyroll will be the place to catch subs and dubs of any new anime for both Sony-owned streamers. Funimation users will only be able to watch new episodes of series already existing on the Funimation service, so now is definitely the time to migrate over to Crunchyroll. To encourage the switch and ease the transition, Funimation subscribers will be receiving an email with an offer for 60 days of a premium Crunchyroll subscription for free. \nCrunchyroll recently became one of four streaming apps available on the Nintendo Switch, and with this consolidation, renders Funimation's Switch app obsolete, bringing the count ostensibly back down to three.",

The good news is Disney is making room on its streaming service for all of the MCU-related TV shows.\nThe countdown is on. Marvel's Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, The Defenders, The Punisher, and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. start streaming March 16 on @DisneyPlus. pic.twitter.com/U80cfZCPa8\nMarch 1, 2022\nStarting on March 16, Disney+ will be the exclusive place to watch every season of Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, The Punisher, The Defenders, and even former ABC series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. which was conspicuously missing from the Marvel lineup. Those shows will join the already accessible Agent Carter on Disney+ that weren't natively made for the service, nor strictly tied to the current Marvel Cinematic Universe storylines. However, the Netflix roster, which has always been part of the MCU canon, has only recently started to be more directly referenced in the newer movies/Disney+ shows so bringing them home makes more sense than ever. \nDisney and Marvel haven't said whether the series migrating to Disney+ will receive any additional seasons, specials, or even films, but with all of these shows hitting the mothership streaming service certainly leaves some doors open. As for the saucier nature of the former Netflix series (these aren't fun family-friendly romps), United States subscribers to Disney+ will see some \"updated parental controls\" landing alongside the shows. Canada, the U.K., Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand will also have access to these shows on March 16.",
