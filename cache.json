You’re gonna cry.\nThere are a lot of forgettable little indie RPGs floating around on the Nintendo Switch eShop, but it’d be a mistake to lump developer Odencat’s Meg’s Monster in with them. In fact, despite appearances of turn-based battles and an underworld filled with monsters to battle, we’d argue that Meg’s Monster isn’t an RPG at all, but rather a game that walks a fine line between the adventure and visual novel genres with light puzzles sprinkled in. It also has humour and heart in equal measure, making for a perfect little game to devote a weekend to.\nMeg’s Monster begins with the titular Meg waking up in a trash heap in the underworld. She soon meets two monsters, Golan and Roy. Golan is quite happy that a child-sized snack waltzed up to them. Roy, on the other hand, has eyes only for an oily substance known as Magic Tar. However, as Golan goes to gobble up Meg, they soon find out her cries trigger an apocalypse. Golan convinces the reluctant and nearly indestructible Roy to keep her safe as they try to find her mom by smuggling her out of the underworld.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

A list of bugs longer than a Saturn V reads like a terrible medical diagnosis: quivering periapsis, unpredictable methane leakage, late-stage separation anxiety, loose payloads, non-stop burning, and sensitive nodes.\nThe developers, smiling bravely in circumstances presumably beyond their control, describe the launch as like dropping a kid off for their first day at school. Well the kid forgot their lunchbox, their uniform, their books and their pencil case. They showed up at the wrong school, on a Saturday during half-term. If you were stranded on a desert island and had to recreate Kerbal Space Program from memory using nothing but coconuts and string, it would look something like Kerbal Space Program 2. The game is nowhere approaching finished, it barely resembles the promotional videos, and it isn’t ready, even by Early Access standards.\nRead more",

          "description": "Most JRPG fans on PC probably know Hironobu Sakaguchi as the creator and grandaddy of the Final Fantasy series. After he left Square Enix in 2003, Sakaguchi opened his own studio and worked on turn-based adventures like Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey - games that arguably matched his genre-defining classics - but PC gamers have been largely unable to experience them, until now. Maybe. Sakaguchi recently took part in a Q&A (reported by IGN Japan, translated by VGC) where he expressed the desire to bring his Apple Arcade exclusive Fantasian to PC.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It’s an enticing prospect for a game that never previously counted visuals as its strong suit, though there will be a catch: the Spacer’s Choice Edition will have significantly higher PC system requirements than the 2019 original.\r\n\n \nRead more",

What's happened here is: I've come away with thoughts, but they're thoughts on one of three modes that's the least useful one to have thoughts on. The other two - the bulk of the game - weren't playable. Still, what I did play was simplistic fun that valued chaos over stealth, with middling results. Unless the other two modes wrap up its action in more interesting ways, I'm unsure whether I can see Crime Boss racking up the cash when it releases next month.\nRead more",

Those that work wonderfully despite their smaller scope, and those that work wonderfully because of it. It’s that second kind - the particular and peculiar voyages into the miniature and mundane - that really spin wonders. Games like Unpacking, PowerWash Simulator, and Dinkum. Games humble enough in scope, and curious enough in outlook, to be uniquely capable of framing everyday experiences so that their inner oddness and strange magic - unfairly dulled by familiarity - shines. \r\n\n\r\nSo, when Jordon - solo dev on the upcoming Time Bandit - brings up the question: how do you want to spend your time? I’m left pondering it for far longer than I think I otherwise would, thinking about it in context. The obvious answer here is: playing an videogame, please. But Time Bandit’s free demo doesn’t take long to make me almost uncomfortably aware that there’s more than one way to play something. I don’t even need to be anywhere near the PC. I might actually be playing it more when I’m not [X-Files music, but also I’m going somewhere with this].\r\n\n \nRead more",

Hawk's famous Thunderfoot tribe. Before we talk about anything else, though, can we please just take a moment to appreciate Zangief's enormous bod? The Street Fighter wrestler was always a force to be reckoned with in earlier games, but holy heck, I bet you could fit four Marcus Fenixes into those biceps and still have room left over for his son and fellow Gears Of War slab JD.

Not so much because it's the first Settlers game in thirteen years, but because the last game by developer Ubisoft Blue Byte was Anno 1800, the best city-builder this side of Cities: Skylines. With an evocative depiction of its simulated industrial revolution, including some delightfully chewy production-line wrangling, Anno 1800 was a treat, and I was keen to see what the Dusseldorf-based studio would cook up next.\nThe answer, unfortunately, is a big bowl of strategy gruel. I'm not sure what has gone wrong in the last five years, but Blue Byte clearly left whatever magic Anno 1800 had in the nineteenth century. The Settlers: New Allies is a dismal strategy affair, confused, anaemic, and achingly dull.\nRead more",

After all, Monster Hunter is a series about an unknown newcomer toppling ancient beasts, chopping up their best bits to create weapons and armour. Forget sleeves, Wild Hearts wears its inspirations as a complete set of clothing crafted from the bones, fur, and teeth of Capcom’s increasingly popular series. Inevitably these materials may feel lesser than the whole from which they were harvested, but they are worn proudly and with confidence nevertheless. \r\n\n\r\nBesides, as a rare challenger to Monster Hunter, Wild Hearts is clearly aware of the difficulties involved in trying to pull off something new. Perhaps this is why Omega Force’s monster battler is so welcoming to newcomers. Finally, here is a game that is willing to teach a player why this long-running genre is held in such high regard. Wild Hearts is the perfect entry point for anyone who has ever dreamed of being a Monster Hunter Liker. A bombastic, brilliant good time that’s held back by frequent, frustrating performance issues on PC.\r\n\n \nRead more",

After all the struggles and dangers I’ve been through trying to keep my ship’s crew alive in the bone-biting cold of the arctic tundra, that’s definitely a success in my book.\nIt’s easy to describe Bellular Studio’s survival sim as just ‘Frostpunk on a ship’, but in some ways that’s pretty accurate: you’re the leader of a group trying to survive in a harsh frozen wasteland. But it’s also a comparison that falls short in plenty of other ways. Sure, the engine of this survival sim might run the same as Frostpunk’s, but it’s buried deep in a handcrafted hull. With an overarching story that deals with the drama and despair of survival, together with a cast of underdog characters whose personalities and flaws fuel your determination to keep them alive, The Pale Beyond is much more human than its steampunk counterpart.\nRead more",

Developers Fatshark were taking the formula established in their co-op horde shooters Vermintide, throwing in some beefy melee, and moving it over to the 40k universe. Fans were less than happy with the end result, pointing toward technical issues, randomness in the endgame, and a lack of crafting systems, which Fatshark are hoping to fix in today’s update. \r\n\n \nRead more",

With two campaigns spanning each side of the sunny Mediterranean, this is arguably Relic's breeziest and most colourful theatre of war yet, evoking the same kind of swagger and gung ho optimism as a Hollywood action flick. It's a feeling that might seem out of place given the current climate, especially now, just days away from the first anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But while your main objective is always one of domination, gradually turning the map from red to blue on both a micro and macro scale, this is ultimately a game about searing comebacks - of beating back seemingly impossible aggressors, and finding hope where previously there was only despair. I think we could all do with a bit of that in this day and age, even if the battles before you end up feeling like nothing more than the digital equivalent of plonking down a big box of toy soldiers on your living room floor and going daka-daka-daka as they all fall over. \nRead more",

I imagine you've experienced a similar thing with video games, whenever a columnist for a broadsheet writes about them and you can instantly tell that they have never played one in their whole dahlia-manuring, boot room-having, fox hunt-following life.\nTomorrow, And Tomorrow, And Tomorrow is a book about the decades-long relationship between two people who are game developers. And like the above, it would be impossible to explain to someone who doesn't work in the games industry why a small exchange between the two of them made me absolutely roar with laughter.\nRead more",

From an Nvidia tech demo back to in 2019 to an RTX-branded trailer released just last month, this souped-up lighting and reflection tech has been a key piston in propelling the Soviet sci-fi FPS’ hype train. Some slightly awkward news, then: the PC version won’t support ray tracing at launch.\nI noticed the lack of ray tracing options in the review build we received last week, and got in touch with the game's press relations team to check if I was missing something, or if they were due to be added via update. The response confirmed that their absence was not an error, and that \"the devs will be looking into implementing this post-launch.\" Well then!\nRead more",

          "description": "If you’re British and you’re old, then you love the ZX Spectrum. (Or the Commodore 64, I suppose, but not both. Never both.) Personally, I’m what they called a “Speccy” kid, and I have carried a deep and profound love of the elderly microcomputer’s cassette tape screeches, colour clash and long, long load times into my adult life, despite the fact that – and please don’t get upset, purists – many of the great Spectrum games don’t hold up in the cold light of the modern day. It’s not that the games are necessarily bad, more that they were tremendous for their time. Still eminently enjoyable, but they require the player to get their head into a certain zone, to put up with what are inarguably quite archaic controls and mechanics. \r\n\n\r\nOddly enough, there are some Spectrum games on Steam, thanks to a publisher called Pixel Games. However, with the utmost respect to their output… these are not the kind of games that are going to foster interest in the Speccy amongst modern players. Of course, that may well not be the point, but I’d be a little taken aback if even avowed old-school gamers were going to bother picking up the likes of gardening simulator Pedro, a game that scored 63% in Newsfield’s iconic Crash magazine back in the day, or Sam Stoat: Safebreaker, which did a little better at 68%.\nRead more",

They all force a little chuckle out of me, but none of them have made me belly laugh like I Am Jesus Christ, a first-person retelling of Christ’s tale from birth, to death, to rebirth.  \r\n\n\r\nI Am Jesus Christ’s genre is slightly murky, although, it almost looks like a giant Skyrim mod complete with unfeeling NPCs, first-person spellcasting, and an open world full of quest markers. The newest trailer shows some of Christ’s cool abilities like walking on water, shooting light beams at Satan, and fishing - which is incidentally what I’m looking forward to the most. \r\n\n\r\nIn fairness, the Christ sim looks like a pretty robust and thorough retelling of his journey, depicting scenes like the Last Supper, only this time all the disciples have exclamation marks above their heads. The Steam page also details 30 different miracles (or spells) and a number of different areas to explore. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Like all good fairytale characters, Pinocchio gets a revision every couple of years - except for 2022, when he was adapted thrice (mostly in bad films, except for the Del Toro one). The loveable puppet isn’t waiting too long for his next comeback, as the RPG Soulslike Lies Of P is coming to PC and Game Pass in August. \r\n\n\r\nLies Of P’s newest trailer is mostly a black screen with a lot of VO, but we get a clear look at Pinocchio's daddy Master Gepetto this time. The trailer follows a blob wobbling through very Victorian streets before it slides into some automation and uses the machine’s body as a puppet. The result is a boss-sized monstrosity that sits halfway between Lovecraftian horror and industrial defect. It also reminds me of Gears 5’s weird infected robots, with tentacles and slime hanging off their metallic arms - equally gross and cool.\r\n\n\r\nThe newest trailer doesn’t show off any Bloodborne-style combat, but we’ve had plenty of looks at that already, including a fight with a gorilla robocop. This Soulslike looks just as aggressive as you’d expect, emphasising quick dodge rolls and last-minute, anxiety-fueled parries. Pinocchio’s arm doubles up as a grappling hook to pull enemies in, which is always cool in a hack n’ slasher, and makes even more sense when you’re playing as a puppet. Also, is it just me or is Pinocchio pretty this time around?\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Quickplay strategy games have always been a thing, but they appear to be gaining in popularity lately. I will probably regret not keeping Ozymandias aside for the traditional \"summer strategy game for when your brain is a gas\" bit, but the scene is looking healthy enough to chance it.\nYou know that cliché feeling of \"just one more turn\"? Ozymandias is a bronze age 4X that builds momentum enough to turn that into \"just one more game\". It is incredibly easy to learn, and despite looking a little dry and number heavy, becomes more effortless, more pleasant the longer you play. It also becomes more clear how much depth there is hidden away in such a light design. It's about proving yourself the most prestigious civilisation, not through total conquest, but by exploiting the lay of the land, and leaning into your strengths.\nRead more",

          "description": "I like wizards because they're the dramatic combination of powerful, cocky, and a bit dim. Through some quirk of bloodline or destiny, wizards can access impossible forces simply by saying magic words. This does not engender caution. A wizard's not a real wizard until they have accidentally set themselves on fire or unleashed an ancient evil. And if you throw four of this dim demigods together? Well, you get the co-op wizard action of the Magicka games, where freestyling elemental combinations can (and often will) lead you to heal a boss or torch your pal's face. Splendid chaos.\nRead more",

DeltaRPM naopak zpomalují instalaci aktualizací tím, že se po stažení musí nové verze balíčků sestavovat ze starých verzí a stažených rozdílů.

A release date was not announced.\nAside from a logo and a single image, developer FromSoftware is keeping tight-lipped regarding the new DLC and its contents. The concept art depicts a haunted plain from The Lands Between, occupied by what appears to be the ghostly gravestones of fallen warriors. A lone figure (Miquella?) rides across the landscape, seemingly headed toward a gnarled, towering tree, pictured far on the horizon.\nhttps://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1630478058103734274?s=20\nIt goes without saying that the Elden Ring DLC news will make the morning of many a video game fan. One of the most successful releases of 2022, Elden Ring would shift somewhere in the region of 20 million copies following its launch just over one year ago. The challenging adventure title would go on to win an array of Game of the Year plaudits, (including our own) and, as such, the player base will be ready and eager to head back into its epic world.\nElden Ring is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post Elden Ring DLC expansion ‘Shadow of the Erdtree’ announced appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "My day is ruined\nIf you are like me, you have taken small comfort in Chris Carter’s reliable coverage of the event Pokemon that can lay eggs in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet. Whether it’s Charmander or Froakie, the inclusion of baby Pokemon has been a nice bonus for the past 7-Star Tera Raid encounters. However, while the new 5-Star Walking Wake and Iron Leaves encounters have otherwise followed the rules of 7-Star raids, there is one crucial exception.\nI am sad to report that, no, neither Walking Wake nor Iron Leaves are capable of laying eggs. Trust me, I tried everything. I got the perfect Ditto, I made an egg power sandwich, I even played \"My Heart Will Go On.\" Neither Paradox Pokemon would make as much as a passing glance at a potential companion. To answer your follow-up question, yes it was the DragonForce cover of \"My Heart Will Go On.\" Of course I used the most romantic version, do you think I’m crazy?\n[caption id=\"attachment_366036\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]\nThis shouldn’t be a terribly big surprise. Paradox Pokemon can’t lay eggs, so your only option for duplicate Paradox monsters is to catch them yourself. That’s a bit harder with Walking Wake and Iron Leaves, as you can only catch one of each while their respective challenge is live. Since the event info does stipulate that these monsters “may be… obtainable through other methods,” it’s possible they will appear more commonly in future DLC. For now, keep your catches of Walking Wake and Iron Leaves safe. At least they won’t elope and move to Unova anytime soon.\nThe post PSA: You CAN’T breed Walking Wake and Iron Leaves in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet appeared first on Destructoid.",

Sometimes unearthing secrets is wrecking shop, as in the case of the series' iconic-but-divisive destructible walls. But Metroid is most interested in finding the line between investigation and annihilation in Metroid Prime.\nMost would agree that the most dramatic difference between Metroid Prime and earlier games is the jump to the third dimension. This opens the door for all kinds of structural shakeups, but my personal favorite is the Scan Visor. With the Scan Visor, Samus can learn details about nearly every element of her env…",

Wow, that's really short notice. This is due to a \"publisher transition,\" and it's expected to be back up on April 1, 2023.\nThe announcement goes on to say that if you already own the game, you will be able to continue to play uninterrupted while the transition takes place. However, if you've deleted the game, they recommend that you re-download and archive it to ensure that you can still access it.\n\nThis isn't super-great for anyone who was holding off on purchasing the game on Switch, but it's not the most profoundly bad news. A little more warning would have been nice, but at least the publishers are being upfront about how long the downtime is expected to bad, and if you already own it you won't have your access to it disrupted. I can't really editorialize beyond that, since I definitely don't have a horse in this race.\nTo reiterate, you have until 10:59pm EST tonight to purchase Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy: Cloud Version.

          "description": "PlayStation and Xbox editions to follow\nHere's some fun news to kick off the week, (well, for me at least), as Forever Entertainment has announced a release date for the returning franchise Magical Drop — The sixth installment in the fast-paced puzzle series will launch on PC and Nintendo Switch on April 25.\nAs we have previously reported, Magical Drop is a long-running series of tile-based puzzlers that was birthed in the arcade market way back in 1995. One or two players fight it out as one of a number of cute anime avatars, all based on the Tarot, in a breathless battle to group together colored orbs and dispatch them onto your opponent's playfield.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndKF-bUxFv4&ab_channel=ForeverEntertainment\nThe goal of this simple-to-learn, hard-to-master gameplay is to set up your own playfield several moves ahead of time, so that the cascading globes will trigger a chain reaction of color groupings, inundating your opponent with extra orbs. (In fact, in Japan, the series is actually titled Chain Reaction.)\nWhile there have been several Magical Drop sequels, the series has been on hiatus since 2012, when a Steam-released Magical Drop V proved to be a disaster — packed with bugs, threadbare on content, and ultimately pulled from sale. Forever Entertainment is clearly hoping to resurrect the franchise with this new release, which will feature six different single-player modes (including Story, Survival, and the mini-game filled \"Path of Destiny\"), as well as support for online and offline vs. battles.\nMagical Drop VI launches on PC and Nintendo Switch April 25. PlayStation and Xbox editions will follow at a later date.\nThe post Magical Drop VI hits PC and Nintendo Switch April 25 appeared first on Destructoid.",

These days have clearly not dissuaded the player community, however, who came out in droves on launch day to dive into the nightmarish adventure.\nSons of the Forest is the sequel to the cult 2014 release The Forest, which managed to build a dedicated player base through its regular appearance on social media, Twitch, and other streaming services. With such an incredible launch already tucked into its toolbelt, it's easy to imagine that the sequel is set to become equally, and likely even more, successful.\nSons of the Forest is available now on Steam Early Access.

Higher resolution graphics and improved performance, enhanced details, dynamic weather, overhauled lighting, and more all await.\nAnd for those who missed the extra story post-launch, Spacer's Choice links all that in too. The Outer Worlds: Spacer's Choice Edition will have both DLC packs, Murder on Eridanos and Peril on Gorgon, included in the package. The new version will retail for $59.99 by itself, though if you own the game on a previous system (PS4, Xbox One) or on the same PC storefront, you can upgrade to this version for $9.99.\nFor those looking to keep their adventure going, though, you'll have to stay on the original platform. A Private Division spokesperson confirmed to us that saves will not transfer over to The Outer Worlds: Spacer's Choice Edition.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2dnCAurJcQ\nIt's Spacer's Choice\nIt's a bit of a surprise to see The Outer Worlds get a bumped-up option for the newer consoles, but likely a welcome one for those who missed this game the first time around. Obsidian's space adventure was certainly a little messy at times, but had some worlds and characters that made a decent impact.\nWith a new sequel in the works, this does seem like a decent excuse to either refresh yourself or get up-to-speed with The Outer Worlds.

And if that wasn't enough, then once you have gathered 999 Gimmighoul coins, then the money-grabbing critter will evolve into Gholdengo!\nFinally, it was revealed that Nintendo and The Pokemon Company are working to bring Pokemon Home connectivity to both Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet later this year, though no further details were made available. We'll be sure to bring you up to speed when a release date is forthcoming.\nThe post Pokemon GO support for Pokemon Scarlet & Violet goes live today appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Dive into the treasure of Area Zero\nToday's Pokemon Presents closed with a confirmation of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet's DLC rollout. The two-part set of post-launch DLC will arrive later this year, with one in the fall and another in the winter of 2023.\nThe combined name of these packs is \"The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero,\" which will carry some meaning for those who have finished the main campaign of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. Both DLC will be playable with the save data you've already got from Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, so they're not standalone from the sounds of it.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiYSuUoI-dY\nPart 1, \"The Teal Mask,\" arrives in fall 2023. You'll visit the land of Kitakami as part of a school trip. The adventure will take you beyond the Paldea region, and look to include some festive wear and locales as part of the excursion.\nPart 2 arrives in winter 2023, and is dubbed \"The Indigo Disk.\" Here, you'll study as an exchange student at Blueberry Academy. There looks to be some battles to take on here, and both DLC will have some new Pokemon to catch as well. This includes the Legendary Pokemon; The Teal Mask will feature Ogrepon, while the Indigo Disk highlights Terapagos.\nA new horizon\nThis DLC goes on sale today in the eShop. Purchasing the new packs of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet DLC will net you some new in-game duds today too, as well as a Hisuian Zoroark.\n\nWhile there are still plenty of questions about what these DLC packs will tackle for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, and how they'll tie into the mysterious Area Zero, we at least know that more is still on the way for the latest mainline Pokemon. As someone who's enjoyed all the theorycrafting and story discussions around the especially dramatic ending of Scarlet and Violet, I'm very interested in seeing what The Pokemon Company concocts for its post-launch Scarlet and Violet tales.\nThe post Pokemon Scarlet and Violet DLC arrives in two parts later this year appeared first on Destructoid.",

According to Bloomberg, developer Sledgehammer Games had initially begun the project as MW2 DLC, but the scope and scale of the project have seen it expanded into its own title — an \"extension\" of sorts for the MW2 narrative/timeline.\nIt should also be noted that while 2021 release Call of Duty: Vanguard was one of the weakest-selling entries in recent years, Modern Warfare 2 was a resounding success, having the most lucrative launch in Call of Duty history, as well as being the fastest title in the series to reach the $1 billion sales milestone. While this is purely speculation, it's not hard to imagine Activision's \"skip a year\" plan was a response to Vanguard's sales, with MW2's staggering success quickly putting paid to that tentative decision.\nCall of Duty 2023 is currently in development at Sledgehammer Games.\nThe post Activision reconfirms 2023 will see a new Call of Duty release appeared first on Destructoid.",

The absence of Xbox has led Larian Studios to clarify, though, that the State of Play announcement doesn't mean there's any platform exclusivity.\nFans questioned whether Xbox would also receive Baldur's Gate 3, after Larian only confirmed PS5, PC, and Mac. Over on Reddit, Larian's community manager posted an update on why exactly that is:\nXbox players, we’ve seen your questions about if/when you can expect Baldur’s Gate 3 on Xbox. We’ve had an Xbox version of Baldur’s Gate 3 in the works for some time, but we have run into some technical issues – particularly with split-screen co-op. We are still working on an Xbox version of BG3, but we’re not yet confident enough to announce it. We don’t like announcing anything until we’re ready, because we don’t want to get peoples hopes up until we’re sure we can deliver.\nThere’s no platform exclusivity preventing us from releasing BG3 on Xbox day and date, should that be a technical possibility. If and when we do announce further platforms, we want to make sure each version lives up to our standards & expectations. Thanks for understanding!\n\nForging the tale\nSo while nothing's set in stone, it does look like Larian is at least working on a version of Baldur's Gate 3 for Xbox. At the very least, there is no platform exclusivity tying the version down if everything clicks into place.\nIt's an odd but refreshing bit of clarity to see, considering how secretive studios can sometimes be with platforms. For Xbox owners, I do hope they get a chance to try this out, whether at launch or later. And for owners of the other options, Baldur's Gate 3 goes live on August 31.\nThe post Larian is working on Baldur’s Gate 3 for Xbox, but it’s not ready for announcement yet appeared first on Destructoid.",

This comes in the wake of a recent report stating the three console makers plan to skip the annual event entirely this year. Sony and Microsoft have yet to confirm any formal attendance. \nIn a statement to IGN, Nintendo say E3 didn’t fit into its plans but will continue to support the event alongside its organizer, the ESA. \n\"We approach our involvement in any event on a case-by-case basis and are always considering various ways to engage with our fans. Since this year’s E3 show didn’t fit into our plans, we have made the decision to not participate. However, we have been and continue to be a strong supporter of the ESA and E3.\"\nAlthough Nintendo was the first of the three console makers to stop holding live E3 press conferences in favor of pre-recorded Direct videos, it was also the last one to have a booth on the show floor. Up until the last traditional show in 2019, Nintendo still had a large, often elaborate area filled with demos and a stage where it broadcasted its Treehouse Live stream. Xbox moved its booth out of the convention center to the Microsoft Theater next door in 2018 (though it was still part of E3); PlayStation pulled out of the event entirely in 2019 and hasn't returned. \nE3 2023 is being organized by ReedPop, the company responsible for overseeing PAX and Star Wars Celebration. It will be the first in-person show since the 2019 edition and only the second to take place since the COVID-19 pandemic started (the 2020 and 2022 shows were completely canceled, while 2021 was a virtual event). E3 runs from June 13-16 at the Los Angeles Convention Center and will have dedicated attendance days for industry and fans. The show has no exhibitor list yet, but Ubisoft recently confirmed it will attend E3 if it happens. Xbox head Phil Spencer has expressed support for E3's success but also alluded to Microsoft holding a separate event around the same time in Los Angeles. \n[Source: IGN]",

Discovery.\nIn a clip pulled from Warner Bros. Discovery's fourth quarter 2022 earnings call yesterday, Warner Bros. president and CEO David Zaslav states that “...there’s lots more to come, including the highly anticipated Mortal Kombat 12 and Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, games also set for release this year with ambitious launch projections.” You can watch the clip in the embedded tweet below. \nHere you go Brusk pic.twitter.com/GYqRd8CZt4\nFebruary 23, 2023\nDeveloper Netherrealm Studios has yet to announce anything on its end. Yesterday, studio head and Mortal Kombat co-creator Ed Boon cheekily tweeted, “so who has heard the news about Injustice 3?”  referencing the fact that for years, Netherrealm has released an Injustice game between Mortal Kombat entries, so technically, that would be next if it maintained that pattern. \nSo who has heard the news about INJUSTICE 3 ?\nFebruary 23, 2023\nFans will have to wait for a flashier reveal, but a Mortal Kombat 12 launch would be huge for a year that already has Street Fighter 6 and potentially Tekken 8 on the schedule. Last October, Neththerrealm revealed Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, a role-playing mobile game also slated to release this year. \nMortal Kombat 11 launched in 2019 to positive reviews (here’s ours).

He holds onto old standby moves like his Screw Piledriver, but gets some new moves on display in the trailer, like the Tundra Storm counter throw.\nLikewise, it seemed only a matter of time before Cammy was revealed. We learned that the Heavy version of three of her signature moves – the Spiral Arrow, Cannon Spike, and Hooligan Combination – are being enhanced to “allow a delay which results in altered properties for some big damage,” according to a press release that went out concurrent with the trailer.\nLily is the one new addition to the fighting roster. She’s a descendant of the Thunderfoot tribe, the same cultural group that produced T. Hawk, a fighter who appeared in Super Street Fighter II. Lily’s a smaller fighter who appears to regularly speak to the spirits of nature. Her moveset includes titles like Condor Dive, Condor Spire, and Tomahawk Buster, and she pulls out war clubs to inflict damage in her attacks.\nStreet Fighter 6 is headed for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PC on June 2.",

If the trailer is any indication, we’re heading into a pretty bleak moment for the characters we’ve been following in this universe since 2014. Across the course of the trailer, we see the approach of The Witness, as it methodically seems to tear through Earth’s defenses and demoralize its defenders.\nIt’s no surprise that things are looking especially dire. In the long-running storyline of the Desinty universe, Lightfall is set to be the penultimate storytelling chapter of the current saga, ahead of next year’s The Final Shape. It won’t be a tremendous surprise if the events of Lightfall set up a seemingly insurmountable dilemma for humanity that can only be resolved with the story arc’s conclusion next year.\nWe won’t have long to wait to see the scope and direction of Lightfall’s narrative; the expansion is set to release next week, on February 28.",

Horizon Call of the Mountain is the big showcase piece for the hardware, and Gran Turismo 7 has been updated to include impressive VR modes. Outside of those first-party games, however, the launch library is mostly made of previously released VR games. The one other major exception is from Capcom, which has made Resident Evil Village playable entirely in PlayStation VR2 with a free update.\nResident Evil 7 received a similar PlayStation VR port in 2017, but I found playing that game in VR underwhelming. It was released early in the VR lifecycle when the basic mechanics of the new platform were still being worked out, and you had to play with a controller. It wasn’t ideal.

          "description": "Tango Gameworks’ founder Shinji Mikami is departing the studio in the coming months after a 12-year tenure. The news was first broken by TrueAchievements, who received and verified a company-wide email to ZeniMax staff announcing the departure before Bethesda publicly confirmed the news on Twitter.\nBethesda’s statement, posted below, doesn't cite a reason or a departure date but thanks Mikami for his tenure at the studio: \nMikami is credited as the creator of Resident Evil, directing several entries during his long tenure at Capcom, where he also worked on titles such as Dino Crisis, Devil May Cry, and Phoenix Wright. Mikami co-founded Capcom’s Clover Studio in 2004, the team behind Okami, Viewtiful Joe, and God Hand (which he directed), but he departed the publisher after Clover’s closure in 2007. He and former Clover leads would establish Platinum Games later that year, where he directed Vanquish. After leaving Platinum, Mikami founded Tango Gameworks in 2010, which was acquired by ZeniMax the same year. He directed the studio’s first title, The Evil Within, and served as executive producer on its sequel and Tango’s subsequent games, Ghostwire: Tokyo and this year’s Hi-Fi Rush.\nIt's unclear what Mikami will do next, but he's leaving Tango in a good place for the future. Hi-Fi Rush, the colorful musical action game that surprise launched in late January, was spearheaded by John Johanas, director of The Evil Within 2, and a team of younger designers. It had perhaps the strongest critical reception of Tango's portfolio thus far, with some calling it an early Game of the Year contender (here's our positive review). Mikami has seemingly done a good job fostering fresh talent and new ideas at Tango before his departure, and we're excited to see what's next for the veteran designer.",

Additionally, this update will be released as free DLC. Unfortunately, Capcom doesn’t provide a release window, but if the studio has only now commenced serious work on the mode with RE4 a month away from launch, it seems unlikely that PS VR2 owners will be gunning down Ganados in their headsets on day one.

          "description": "Fans of Castlevania, namely the Koji Igarashi-led titles such as Symphony of the Night, may want to keep an eye on Grim Guardians: Demon Purge. The game comes from Azure Strike Gunvolt developer Inti Creates and stars two demon-slaying sisters who must scale a monster-laden castle to rescue their high-school from destruction.\nEach sister sports a unique playstyle. Shinobu fires a gun making her suited for long-ranged attacks, while Maya cuts down targets with close-ranged melee assaults. The game features two-player co-op, but playing alone lets you swap between sisters on-the-fly, each with their own health bar. This creates a unique form of strategy that we showcase in our gameplay footage below. Watch Marcus Stewart and Wesley LeBlanc explore Grim Guardian: Demon Purge's fiendish offerings to find out if it has the potential to be a worthy Castlevania successor. \n\n\nFor more previews and discussions of some of the biggest games of 2023 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Atomic Heart, Metroid Prime Remastered, WWE 2K23, SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake, Tchia, Persona 3 Portable, and more.",

          "description": "Microsoft has signed a binding 10-year legal agreement with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo players, presuming the company's colossal $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard is approved. \nSince the acquisition announcement last year, Microsoft has been attempting to prove to government agencies like the U.S.' Federal Trade Commission that this acquisition does not fall into any monopolistic activity and would not harm competitors like PlayStation. However, Microsoft has had a bit of a rough go at it. To counter, though, the company has been proactive in attempting to get the greenlight from the FTC, going as far as promising PlayStation that Call of Duty games will continue to come to Sony's consoles and agreeing to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo hardware. \nNow, Microsoft president and vice chair Brad Smith has announced on Twitter that Microsoft has formally signed a legally binding 10-year agreement with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty games to Nintendo players. Here's the statement Smith released on behalf of Microsoft, in full: \nWe’ve now signed a binding 10-year contract to bring Xbox games to Nintendo’s gamers. This is just part of our commitment to bring Xbox games and Activision titles like Call of Duty to more players on more platforms. pic.twitter.com/JmO0hzw1BO\nFebruary 21, 2023\nMany have already begun to speculate how Activision Blizzard will bring Call of Duty games to Nintendo consoles, which are traditionally much less powerful than current-gen Xbox and PlayStation consoles, with \"full feature and content parity.\" \nIf I had to guess, Call of Duty will likely go the route of cloud gaming seen on the Switch, unless Nintendo's next console is set to be a significantly more powerful piece of hardware. Only time will tell. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's thoughts on the latest Call of Duty in our Modern Warfare II review. \nDo you think bringing Call of Duty to Nintendo platforms is a big deal?

A new story trailer introduces a seemingly villainous character, Simon, while highlighting some of the dangerous monstrosities waiting to dismantle players. \nLies of P unfolds in the fictional, Belle Époque-era French city of Krat as players control Pinocchio, a mechanoid puppet on a quest to become human. A certain Mr. Geppetto might be able to help with that, but Krat has been overtaken by sinister creatures Pinocchio must cut down using his multi-purpose mechanical arm. \n\n\nThe gameplay takes heavy cues from From Software’s work – Bloodborne in particular – as players take down enemies with deliberate sword attacks, while various mechanical arms grant abilities like firing lightning bolts or a grappling hook to reel in targets. Outside of battles, sidequests present the option of lying to characters, and the truthfulness of your answers alters the direction of these stories. \nLies of P will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass), and PC.

          "description": "Sound design is an often overlooked and underappreciated element of many games, but it's an element Capcom takes very seriously in Resident Evil 4. As horrific as the game looks, it's the soundtrack and creepy sound effects that do much of the heavy lifting in building fear and tension. To understand how the remake remixes and enhances the original game's soundscape, I picked the brains of RE4 sound director Hiroshi Tamura and lead composer Kota Suzuki to learn how they're making the game sound as good as it plays. \nGame Informer: A goal for the Resident Evil 4 remake is to create more believable soundscapes. Can you discuss what that means, with examples, and why that's important to the team?\nHiroshi Tamura: For the remake, we wanted to pay great attention to the sound throughout the game…",

Two of these titles, Song of Nunu and Convergence, had been previously announced, while the third game, The Mageseeker, makes it debut. \n\n\nThe Mageseeker is set to arrive first sometime this spring. Developed by Digital Sun, the team behind Moonlighter, it’s described as a gritty 2D action RPG. It stars Sylas and takes place in Demacia. You can find The Mageseeker on PC and unspecified consoles. \nConvergence launches this summer and was first revealed at The Game Awards in 2019. Starring Ekko, it’s a 2D action-platforming adventure by Double Stallion that features parkour and time-manipulation mechanics. Convergence launches for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam and Epic. \nSong of Nunu closes out the year. Releasing this fall, it centers on the young Nunu and his yeti partner Willump on a search to find Nunu’s mother. The charming adventure game focuses on the pair working together to solve environmental puzzles. Song of Nunu comes from the folks at Tequila Works, the developer of titles such as Rime and Gylt, and it will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam and Epic. \nRiot released its first League of Legends spin-off Ruined King in 2021 to generally positive reviews, so we're curious to see how these other projects fair and if they'll attract new, non-MOBA fans coming off Netflix's well-received Arcane series. Which League of Legends title are you most interested in?

          "description": "A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.6.1. It's time to prepare for a new release!\nOur lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:\nSoldier Boyz\nGLK Scott Adams Interactive Fiction games (C64 and ZX Spectrum)\nGLK Scott Adams adventures 1-12 (TI99/4A format)\nObsidian\nPink Panther: Passport to Peril\nPink Panther: Hokus Pokus Pink\nDriller/Space Station Oblivion\nHalls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II\nBesides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list. Maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long - otherwise, there are some demos of these games available on our website.\nAnd since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen notable changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.\nAs usual, we are not just adding support for new games. We are constantly working on improving the engines we already support and, in particular, we’ve seen some incredible work being done on the SCUMM engine. Yes, there are the usual bug fixes, but this time we are also adding a feature that helps playing the SCUMM games in a truly original fashion: Support for the original loading and saving dialogs within the GUI!\nSpeaking of truly original: Remember those old CRT displays we had back in the day? With ScummVM 2.7.0 you’ll be able to replicate this experience on certain platforms thanks to our new shader-based scalers. Go ahead and give it a try!\nAll testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.\nA detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.\nThank you very much for your support! Let’s make ScummVM 2.7.0 a great release - together!\n>",

Depending on your perspective, we’re either two months early for our usual April 1st release, or a bit tardy for the Christmas 2022 release we intended. We think the wait has been worth it. This is one of the largest releases we’ve done in several years, with numerous features and improvements covering the user interface, gameplay features, and modding extensions for NewGRF and Game Script creators. Some of the highlights are: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. This includes better automatic scaling when using HiDPI or mixed DPI setups. Direct access to NewGRF/AI/GS settings from the new game window. Various small tweaks and improvements to several windows. NewGRFs can now provide engine variants that are shown hierarchically in the purchase list. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. Custom league tables for GameScripts. More natural rivers which get wider as they flow downstream. And much more, which can be seen in the changelog or the previous release announcements! In addition to these features and improvements, we’ve fixed lots of bugs. (If you played with the RC2 testing release, most were fixed before then. See the changelog for full details.)
