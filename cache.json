Hindsight is a story that plays out through gentle interactions, with no complex objectives or skill challenges, and it’s beautifully presented and brimming with nostalgic charm.\nThe game presents a series of static 3D scenes from the narrator’s life, within which you can turn the camera to find interactive elements. The locations are everyday settings – rooms of a home, a restaurant, the seaside – and the protagonist is present in all of them, experiencing or reflecting on events. The interactive parts may be further apparitions of the protagonist, which you select to move the camera over to them, or even objects that glint to signal their significance.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Fortunately, that seems to be more than just pastel colours and cynical “For girls” marketing – the G375 headset, G705 mouse, and the G715 and G713 keyboards are all proper gaming-spec accessories, and they’ve been crafted by mostly female design and engineering teams based on feedback from women PC players.\r\n\n\r\nThe G705, then, is a wireless mouse designed for smaller hands, while the G375 headset – also wireless – is proportioned to fit smaller heads and has more space in the earcups to accommodate earrings. It’s safe to say I’m not the Aurora Collection’s target audience, but having used the G705, the G375, and the G715 wireless keyboard as my main peripherals for a few days, I can say all three are pretty swish playthings regardless of how you identify. What’s more, their light, soft-cornered aesthetic is a nice break from the blacks, greys and harsh angles that have become standard design language for gaming gear. Anyone who’s ever cringed their face inside out at a peripheral resembling Megatron’s running shoe may indeed find these more to their tastes.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The story of Wolfenstein 3D’s development makes for a fascinating time capsule of those early days of game development - a milestone in gaming history that underlines just how much the industry has grown over the decades since.\nBut that’s getting ahead of ourselves a bit. The origins of Wolfenstein 3D, a gloriously violent game that paved the way for the even more gloriously violent Doom, can be found in a somewhat more cutesy series of titles: the Commander Keen series. id Software made four of these side-scrolling platformers for MS-DOS in very quick succession between 1990 and 1991, and studio co-founder John Romero tells us that the team was definitely ready for a change.\nRead more",

With nowhere else to go, she’s decided to take the bus back to her hometown of Timber Hills to move back in with her parents (hopefully, temporarily). While she's killing time on the journey, she begins to take a dating personality quiz aptly titled ‘What’s your Thirstsona?’ and it transports her to a colourful dreamlike metaverse where she can skate around and answer deep questions about her love life.

I know which one I prefer, because the story mode is a love letter to Half-Life 2, complete with Bane-muffled jackboot cops, endlessly catching up with a Story Guy who's inexplicably ahead of you again, a bionic arm standing in for the gravity gun, and a spooky dark underground section where you're swarmed by creepy mutants.

This makes it a good time to pick up a SATA drive for desktops or laptops that can't accommodate another M.2 drive, especially for media or game storage where the speed difference between SATA and NVMe is minimal. \nToday, Teamgroup's imaginatively-named T-Force Vulcan Z drive is down to $128 for a 2TB model, the lowest price we can find for this size at present. \nNote that to get this price, you do need to be an Amazon Prime member - normal folk you like and me will see a price of $160 instead, alongside a reminder to 'join Prime to save $32 on this item'. You should be able to join Prime under a free trial, order the item and then cancel your Prime status to avoid a charge. \nRead more",

          "description": "I’ve been excited to play Exoprimal, Capcom’s upcoming multiplayer dino shooter, ever since it used the phrase “unstoppable raptor horde” in one of its trailers. It is a completely unhinged combination of words that makes me giddy just thinking about them. I’ll often find myself muttering them out loud when I’m unloading the dishwasher or folding laundry. “Unstoppable raptor horde”. It’s like the season finale of language. It’s perfect.\r\n\n\r\nAdmittedly, prior to the existence of that phrase, I was feeling a little sceptical about Exoprimal’s existence. Not only does Capcom have - let’s say - a less than favourable track record when it comes to multiplayer titles, but as a long-term fan of Dino Crisis I was a bit miffed to see them creating a game featuring prehistoric creatures that wasn’t some kind of lavish remake of my beloved PS1 series.\r\n\n \nRead more",

And I reckon much of their differences come down to the simple health bar, or lack of it.\nRead more",

I haven't done that with Hob's Barrow yet,\" he says. \"Basically, Victorian gothic horror story. That's the best way to describe it.\"\nOriginally announced as Incantamentum (Gilbert jokes that one of the reasons behind the name change is because he could never pronounce \"Incantamentum\" correctly), Wadjet Eye got involved after Gilbert played the Steam demo last year and emailed the developer. \"I said, 'Hey, I played the demo. I really liked it. Please tell me you're going to be adding voice acting to this because it's screaming for it',\" Gilbert tells me. \"And he said, 'Well, we will if we can find a publisher who'll do it for us.'\" So now Wadjet Eye are publishing, and Gilbert is overseeing the voice recording.\nRead more",

Whether you're up to no good in Red Dead Redemption 2 or stealing from the rich to (sort of) give to the poor in the original Desperados, these temples of cash have long been the scenes of messy shootouts, upturned tables, and big, golden pay-outs. At least when your heist strategy's going according to plan, that is. In an exclusive demo for one of the later levels in Hard West 2, the upcoming sequel to the 2015 turn-based tactics original, Ice Code Games' chief technology officer Mateusz Pilski is starting to feel the heat a bit. The bank is well guarded, with at least half a dozen gunslingers staking out the doors at the front, and untold numbers waiting in hidden nooks and crannies further back. He takes a moment to consider his approach, but he begins his assault with confidence.  \n\"In any XCOM-like, when you see that many enemies and that much firepower, in that good a position, you think, okay, I'm fucked up,\" he tells me. \"In just a second, I will show you how you can use Bravado to totally overturn the situation.\"\nRead more",

Pár týdnů práce vývojářů (no, vlastně jde prakticky jen o Gerta Wollnyho) nyní vyústilo v rozšíření této funkcionality i na starší modely. Vývoj je víceméně hotov a Mesa dostává vylepšení běhu OpenGL i pro modely od HD 4000 níže až k HD 2900, tedy prvním GPU AMD s unifikovanými shadery.",

          "description": "Take a look at the new Paldea region for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet\nToday, we got a new look at Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, the next mainline entries in the series. Alongside a deeper dive into the people, places, and goals set out for prospective Pokemon Trainers, we also now have a full map of the Paldea region.\nPaldea is the name of the new region for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, home to a variety of little monsters to discover. While we've had hints about the new region before, today we got a top-down view of the whole landmass.\nAcross the entire region we can see lakes, deserts, mountains and more. A port town resides on the right-hand side, while a large city sits in the center. Also, there's one big, cloudy region at the center.\n\nIt certainly seems like we won't be wanting for variety. There's a good mix of all kinds of different biomes here, so it should be easy enough to geo-locate some Pokemon of differing types.\nExploring the open world of Paldea\nWhat's also different about this Pokemon entry and region is that Scarlet and Violet are open-world games. As confirmed in today's Pokemon Presents, the new Pokemon games will allow players to tackle the three different story threads at their own pace.\nSo if you wind up catching some strong Fire Pokemon and feel bold, you can head right on over to the Ice Gym and challenge the newly revealed Gym Leader, Grusha.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZf-vIpVDLo\nOr maybe you'd rather go check out that aforementioned port town, or head right to the big city. It's all connected and available, and with the power of your mighty motorcycle Legendary Pokemon mount, the Paldea region of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet is yours to explore.\nPokemon Scarlet and Violet will launch for the Nintendo Switch on November 18, 2022.\nThe post Here’s the map of the Paldea region in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "\"TBA\"\nWe haven't heard much in terms of the release date of Metroid Prime 4, or any info at all really, but Nintendo did a least mention it in their latest financial briefing.\nThey mentioned quite a few games, actually. Going forward, here is what their first party major games slate looks like as of August 3, 2022:\nKirby's Dream Buffet - Summer 2022\nSplatoon 3 - 9/9/2022\nBayonetta 3 - 10/28/22\nPokemon Scarlet/Violet - 11/18/22\nBreath of the Wild 2 - Spring 2023\nMetroid Prime 4 - TBA\nAdvance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp - TBA\nOut of all of these, Nintendo also chose to specifically highlight these to investors: Xenoblade Chronicles 3, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - Booster Course Pass: Wave 2, Splatoon 3, and Kirby's Dream Buffet. All of those are \"near future\" type products set to release by the end of September. Curiously, though Dream Buffett still just has a \"summer\" date, they list it under the \"by the end of September\" category in the brief, hinting at a release window (summer in all likelihood confirmed that anyway, but this seemingly is not going to get hit with a delay as of yet). The company also reminded everyone that a new Switch OLED model was coming on August 26 in honor of Splatoon 3. Metroid Prime 4 is still sadly TBA, as is Advance Wars.\nDLC seems to be the plan for long term growth, as Nintendo pointed out that \"sales were also steady for add-on content, including Animal Crossing: New Horizons – Happy Home Paradise\" in that same brief, and many of the above games have some form of DLC or season pass content already announced; or likely in the works.\nThe post In latest financial report, Nintendo confirms Metroid Prime 4 is still on the slate appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's for a \"special Pikachu,\" and will be inline with the new \"Terastallizing\" form mechanic that's been introduced in this generation.\nIt knows the move \"Fly,\" and is also a flying Tera type. The event will run from the game's launch (when you can access it), through February 28, 2023. It's similar to other early access events from mainline games: the idea is to incentivize players into picking up the game early. That's pretty much all we have in terms of details at the moment.\nAs for the technical fine print, The Pokemon Company notes that you can acquire this through normal mystery gift means: which also confirms the feature for Scarlet and Violet (as if there was any chance it wasn't coming back). You do not need a paid Switch Online membership to access the special Pikachu distribution event, and it takes \"one to one and a half hours\" to work up to the point where the mystery gift feature is enabled.\nPokemon Scarlet and Violet special Pikachu distribution event details:\n\nThe post Pokemon Scarlet and Violet already have a special Pikachu distribution event appeared first on Destructoid.",

After dropping a short teaser for the game late last week, the publisher released the debut trailer for Samurai Maiden this morning. From developer Shade Inc., perhaps best known for Gun Gun Pixies and the Bullet Girls franchise, the action title puts players in control of Tsumugi Tamaori who, after falling asleep following her history lesson, wakes up in Sengoku-era Japan. It's there she meets Nobunaga Oda, who gifts her a sacred sword she'll need to defeat undead mobs that have taken over the land. Tamaori may be out of place in the past but she won't be alone. Along the way, she'll hook up with three ninjas from the Honnoji Temple to aid her in her mission.\nThe three teammates will come in handy when players want to unleash attacks using the Gokage System – which combines her sword skills with their ninjutsu specialties – to help fight through the hellish hordes. As the girls adventure together and grow their bonds, they'll also gain access to special abilities that can be unlocked when they share a kiss, something that's hinted at the end of the trailer below. Before you get too excited, keep in mind this game is rated \"T\" for Teen.\n\nThe trailer makes a good enough first impression on me that I'll have to keep tabs on Samurai Maiden as we draw closer to its release date. I know Shade Inc. might not have the most polished resume, but it doesn't take that much for a hack 'n' slash to keep me entertained.\nSamurai Maiden will launch this winter for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC via Steam.\nThe post Samurai Maiden is a Gen Z kid in Nobunaga Oda’s court appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "New Blood announces two dates at once\nWhile the date for one game is moving back a few weeks, another is sliding in to take its place. Publisher New Blood confirms that Gloomwood will have its Early Access launch pushed back, with Ultrakill Act 2 taking its spot.\nWhile the immersive sim Gloomwood was set to hit Early Access on August 16, the game will need some extra time to come together. A few issues have cropped up over the last few months, according to a statement, as well as some developers coming down with COVID-19. The team made the decision to push its release date back by three weeks, to September 6.\nhttps://twitter.com/NewBlood/status/1554532639259783168\nIt's a little extra time for those who have been patiently waiting, but from the ash arrives a new launch to take its place. New Blood confirms that the second act of Ultrakill, a retro-inspired FPS inspired by the heydays of the '90s, arrives on August 16.\nUltrakill, which is in Early Access right now, has an overwhelmingly positive reception so far on Steam's user reviews. And while it's only $20 at the moment, the price will be going up on August 16 with the launch of Act 2.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXiCFvaoVik\nHot swap launches\nWhile Gloomwood fans may be waiting a bit longer for their particular brand of immersive sim, there is at least more Ultrakill on the way to tide them over. And really, both seem to scratch an itch of retro-inspired first-person PC gaming. Just each in their own little way; Gloomwood in sneaking and surviving, and Ultrakill in over-the-top shooter fashion.\nIt's a fun swap that New Blood has done, and I'm down with it. Plus, Gloomwood also has a pre-alpha demo available on its Steam page right now, if you're quite eager to try it out. Ultrakill also has a demo, and Act 1 is currently in Early Access.\nThe post Gloomwood Early Access has been delayed, and Ultrakill Act 2 is moving into its slot appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Free games for a limited time\nGoogle Stadia may not have seen the massive success that the company was hoping for, but almost three years after its launch, the streaming service is still holding on. Now it seems that Google has a plan to get more players onboard, because they've just announced that they have over 120 game trials (and more on the way) that you can hop in and try out right now, no payment or Stadia account required. The catalog includes hit games like Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, Far Cry 6, Little Nightmares, Saints Row: The Third, Terraria, Spiritfarer, and many more. Of course, this deal isn't without its stipulations.\nThe trials may in fact be free, but players' time with each game is limited from anywhere between 120 minutes to 30 minutes, which is pretty insubstantial depending on which game you're playing.\nSo, it's looking like this is a better deal if you're already looking to try Stadia — as one Reddit user points out, playing the trials of games like Hotline Miami is actually a great way to see if Stadia's streaming will work with your network and hardware.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pwb6d2wK3Qw\nIf you're someone who doesn't want to drop a ton of money on a console or PC gaming rig, Stadia is a nice option, in theory, assuming that it works for you. Okay so maybe there are a lot of \"ifs\" at play here, but that never stopped Google, clearly.\nRegardless of the logistics, others on Reddit praised the trial model, and said they wished Steam would do the same thing. Games are expensive, and only raising in price, so it makes sense that players would want to try out a game before they commit to dropping some major cash for the full thing. If you've ever looked at Google Stadia and thought, \"it's a good idea, but...\" this is a good no-risk opportunity to give it the ol' college try.\nThe post Google Stadia has over 120 game trials, no subscription needed appeared first on Destructoid.",

In the latest status check, Eric \"ConcernedApe\" Barone said on Twitter that 1.5 may be ready before the end of 2022 — a far-off ETA, for sure, but something to latch onto at least.\n\"The 1.5 update for [Stardew Valley] mobile is making very good progress,\" he tweeted. \"It should be out before the end of the year. Mobile players... thanks for your patience.\"\nUpdate 1.5 includes Ginger Island, a new getaway to explore and expand, as well as numerous improvements to the core game. You can have a fish tank, watch ducks swim, move your bed, sit on chairs, raise ostriches, and try a beach farm layout. The list goes on.\n[caption id=\"attachment_337736\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1920\"] Ginger Islands is one of the best parts of Stardew Valley.[/caption]\nFrom the sound of it, all Barone can really do is relay and reiterate information as the Stardew Valley porting team continues working on the expansive update. And, in the meantime, he's busy working on his upcoming life-sim game, Haunted Chocolatier.\nWhenever the day comes, there's going to be a huge sigh of relief. Android and iOS players have been waiting for anything concrete, and with today's news, we're getting there.\nThis is the kind of long-lasting game that players (and the creator) can't seem to walk away from, and update 1.5, in particular, is a culmination of everything it represents as a wholesome slice-of-life experience. I've said it before and I'll say it again — Ginger Island is a highlight, and it's wild that it's a free update. I loved searching for collectibles.\n[Image credit: Nico-Kun]\nThe post Stardew Valley 1.5 mobile could hit before the end of 2022 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "\"The total walkable area\"\nJust how big is the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 world compared to the second game? A whopping five times as large, according to the developers.\nThis raw figure was disclosed via part three of an official developer interview series, featuring Tetsuya Takahashi (senior director and chief creative officer at Monolith Soft), Koh Kojima (producer and director at Monolith Soft), and Genki Yokota (producer and director at Nintendo).\nAfter being asked about the scope of the game, and how big it was intended to be as the third entry in a major series, Kojima laughed, and really let loose just how big the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 world really is:\n\"Come to think of it, we were just talking about this yesterday in the office. That the world would be crazy big for this title. So I actually did the math, and it turns out that the total walkable area in this game is over five times larger than in the second title. It was like... \"Yikes!\"\n\nKojima elaborates, citing the hindsight of accumulated knowledge from prior games to really allow this map to sing. This allowed the team to get more \"creative\" instead of just re-using variations of the same landscape concepts, and cites the danger of over-designing things like \"wall pattern\" aesthetics, which can cut into development time needed to implement more gameplay. Draw distance was apparently a priority though, and I think that was a good call — despite the limitations of the Switch hardware, the game managed to really surprise me at times with some amazing-looking vistas.\nIf you're interested in diving deeper into the world of Xenoblade Chronicles 3, you can find all three interviews from the series below!\nXenoblade Chronicles 3 interview series links:\nPart 1\nPart 2\nPart 3\nThe post The world of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is “five times larger” than the second game appeared first on Destructoid.",

But once the Wo Long demo comes out, provided that it's a blast, you'll probably be hearing about it then!\nYep, over on the game's official Twitter account, the studio is starting their marketing campaign early, noting that the game will have sorcery elements, as well as online multiplayer, a morale system, a character creator, and more. The last bullet point is the most important: a \"gameplay trial in the near future.\"\nStarting with the pre-launch period for Nioh years back, it's been customary for Team Ninja to test out their action game via highly prolific game trials: which also serve as a beta of sorts. It allows the studio to reevaluate their internal meta, adjust things like mechanics, animations, and difficulty curves; and even spotlights quality of life features.\nSo far it's worked out pretty great for them, as both Nioh entries have been bolstered by great beta-to-launch upgrades, and meaty post-launch patches.

Alongside the greatest fighting game players in the world — duking it out for prize pools, trophies, and bragging rights — fans can also look forward to news, reveals, and other tidbits pertaining to the current crop of competitive scrappers.\nArc System Works, the veteran fighting game developer behind great titles such as Dragon Ball FighterZ, BlazBlue, DNF Duel, and Guilty Gear, has announced that it will be hosting a special presentation on the first day of Evo, offering tournaments attendees the opportunity to play games and bag cool merch, while audiences at home can enjoy exhibition matches, competitions and giveaways, and various other live stream events.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Y-pBgT2sQQ\nThe day will be highlighted by a special panel presentation looking at \"The Past, Present, and Future of GuiltyGear.\" Headed up by series creator Daisuke Ishiwatari, the development team will discuss the quirky fight franchise — sharing stories, spotlighting unused concept material, and fielding questions from members of the GG community. The panel will conclude with non-specific \"news\" regarding the second season of Guilty Gear Strive, so here's hoping that we get a character reveal or two, along with a date for the previously teased crossplay beta.\nThe Arc System Works Guilty Gear Evo panel kicks off Friday, August 5, at 10:00 PT / 13:00 ET / 18:00 BST. You can check out the action over on the official Evo Twitch channel. The weekend promises all sorts of exciting news pertaining to the world of fighting games, and we'll be sure to cover as much as we can right here on Destructoid.\nEvo 2022 takes place between August 5-7 at the Las Vegas Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino.\nThe post Guilty Gear Strive Season 2 news coming to EVO this Friday appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Fated Fit\nAugust is now well underway, and that means were are mere weeks out from the launch of the exciting-looking JRPG Soul Hackers 2. Publisher Atlus has dropped a brand new trailer for the stylish sequel, keeping fans teetering on high fervor ahead of the game's official launch on August 26.\nThe trailer itself does not offer us any new information regarding features or mechanics, it is purely a contextless, narrative affair — its one-minute runtime packed out with more melodrama than you can shake a Sabbath at. Perhaps the one element that stands out the most in this short preview is just how damn good everybody looks. While Shin Megami Tensei is most certainly full of demon-hunting, world-ending plotlines, its various protagonists and antagonists are never too busy to ensure that they look sharp as all hell. It's quite literally a franchise trademark at this point.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYdZZLhBYYM&t\nSoul Hackers 2 will tell the story of specialized “Data Agents” Ringo and Figue, who have been dispatched to Earth to track down Persons of Interest related to an incoming apocalypse. What will follow is a lot of high-drama, social engagement, dungeon-exploring, demon-gathering, and strategic, elemental combat, all dressed up in SMT's unmistakably excessive aesthetic. Soul Hackers 2, for lack of a better phrase, simply came out of nowhere. It was only announced five months ago, and now it is just three weeks away from launch.\nAt least nobody was kept waiting... It is the end of the world, after all.\nSoul Hackers 2 launches August 26 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post Soul Hackers 2 shows off its twisted fates and fly fashions appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "New episodes of the making-the-band series will debut weekly\nIf you dig pop songs and narrative adventures, We Are OFK might just be crafting a mix for you. Indie-pop interactive series We Are OFK debuts with its first two episodes on August 18, 2022.\nThe biopic series follows the members of OFK, a virtual band looking for their big break in the Los Angeles music scene. The interactive animated series takes place over five episodes, with five interactive music videos that double as tracks performed by OFK.\nTeam OFK, the developers behind the project, includes some multifaceted talent from the gaming, TV, music, and film industries.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu2iKC4fVDs\nIn essence, it's kind of like an interactive Gorrilaz or Josie & The Pussycats narrative adventure. Episodes will have fully-voiced dialogue and texting interfaces for long-range chats. It also looks like it will have some drama, as these 20-somethings try to make it big while also dealing with heartbreak, music-making, and paying the rent.\nThe first two episodes debut on August 18, while new episodes premiere weekly afterward on August 25, September 1, and September 8. The season will ultimately be five episodes long.\nSpin the record\nFor collectors, We Are OFK is also getting a couple special physical goodies. One that makes perfect sense is a 2x vinyl, which includes OFK's singles, art prints, and some special acoustic tracks. Those acoustic versions can only be heard on the vinyl.\n\nThere's also a physical version planned for the Nintendo Switch and PS5 versions of We Are OFK, which includes all five chapters and a papercraft version of Debug the cat. I guess Stray is no longer the only cat game on the market.\n\nBoth versions arrive via iam8bit, and are currently up for order on the iam8bit site.\nWe Are OFK premieres on Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, and PC via both Steam and Epic on August 18.\nThe post Musical indie-pop story We Are OFK premieres on August 18 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Of course, this still equates to total revenue of around $1.64 billion USD for the quarter, so it's hardly doomsday for the industry giant.

          "description": "Time to light up Night City\nNetflix anime series Cyberpunk: Edgerunners got a new trailer today, and it looks both gorgeous and full of action. Today's trailer lets us meet some of the main cast and see the set-up for the action, as well as how Night City is being adapted into anime form.\nAnime fans who didn't already know will probably notice right away that Studio Trigger is at the helm. Trigger is the studio behind productions like Promare and Kill la Kill, and boy, does it show in this new trailer. The fast action, berating line reads, and gorgeous style bleeds through in the new Edgerunners trailer.\nIt does, also, take some quieter moments. The story looks to follow David as he gets tied up in the back-alley gigs of Night City.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiR_lMNlJko\nAlongside an incredible adaptation of the world and design, based off the tabletop RPG, Studio Trigger also seems to be taking cues from CD Projekt Red's Cyberpunk 2077. The call tone, for instance, is the same one used in the video game. And a few of the vistas we see in the trailer are very similar to their 2077 look.\nA cyberpunk future\nNetflix has had some hits and some misses in the video game adaptation department as of late. On one hand, Castlevania is one of their big series and is currently headed into the Richter Belmont era. And League of Legends series Arcane has been absolutely stellar. But Dragon's Dogma didn't do quite as well on the animated front.\nThis is Studio Trigger, though, and I think that plus the potential of a good Cyberpunk adaptation is enough reason to tune in. There is still some Cyberpunk 2077 content on the way somewhere down the line, though CD Projekt Red seems like it's mostly moving towards The Witcher for the future. I'm very much into Trigger's take on Night City, though.\nCyberpunk: Edgerunners hits Netflix next month, in September 2022.\nThe post Cyberpunk: Edgerunners showcases some gorgeous action in new trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

There's even denotations for tracks that have been reused, or have never appeared again in any future game (and thus would be more ideal for preservation in Deluxe).\nIt's interesting seeing everything broken down game by game. It feels like there should be more Super Mario Kart/SNES tracks in Deluxe, but there's only three! Nintendo better pump those numbers up eventually. I always had a feeling that Mario Kart Tour was super represented, but seeing it on paper is something else.\nBeyond that, everything seems to be pretty well spread out across the rest of the series. Maybe we could use some more Double Dash (especially since it has some unique tracks that haven't seen the light of day again)? But other than that, Nintendo has given each game a decent amount of representation.\nAs a note, the red exclamation mark (!) icon denotes tracks that were just recently confirmed to be part of \"Wave 2\" of the Booster Course [Season] Pass. We have four more waves to get to by the end of 2023, so there's plenty on the way.\nMario Kart 8 Deluxe track list (including what hasn't made it in yet):\n\nThe post A Mario Kart 8 Deluxe community member made a handy list of every past Mario Kart track that is and isn’t in Deluxe yet appeared first on Destructoid.",

If you weren't able to attend those events (or the virtual event earlier this year), you've missed out on your opportunity to catch them to this point. However, that changes later this month, as the four Ultra Beasts are set to gather during the Pokémon Go Fest 2022: Finale event.\nThe finale is a global event that trainers can enjoy regardless of location. In addition to the Ultra Beasts, participating trainers will encounter other Pokémon they may not usually see in the wild, as well as the Mythical Pokémon Shaymin, who can be obtained by completing special research missions. This also features the conclusion of the story of Professor Willow being sucked into an Ultra Wormhole. The Ultra Beasts available in Pokémon Go through this event include Pheromosa, Nihilego, Buzzwole, and Xurkitree.\nFinally, Daily Adventure Incenses have been added to the game. These special incenses can be used once a day and last for 15 minutes. This special daily item can attract Pokémon not typically found in your area and can even pull in Legendary Pokémon. \nSince the game's launch in 2016, Pokémon Go has expanded well beyond the original 151 creatures. As of this writing, you can now catch, train, and battle more than 700 Pokémon throughout your travels. The Pokémon Go Fest 2022: Finale is set to happen on Saturday, August 27, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. local time.",

In it, the company revealed that the Switch surpassed 111 million units sold but, despite that, overall sales are down. \nIn terms of hardware, sales are down 22.9%, with Nintendo citing the ongoing semiconductor shortage as why. Software sales are down too, declining 8.6% this quarter. However, while 8.6% is a sizeable drop, Nintendo still moved 41.41 million units in Q1 FY23. It also revealed its top 10 best-selling Switch games, with many having seen increases since the last round of financial results earlier this year. \nHere are the top 10 best-selling Nintendo Switch games as of June 2022: \nMario Kart 8 Deluxe: 46.82 million \nAnimal Crossing: New Horizons: 39.38 million\nSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate: 28.82 million\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild: 27.14 million\nPokemon Sword/Pokemon Shield: 24.50 million\nSuper Mario Odyssey: 23.93 million\nSuper Mario Party: 18.06 million\nPokemon Brilliant Diamond/Pokemon Shining Pearl: 14.79 million\nPokemon: Let's Go, Pikachu!/Pokemon: Let's Go, Eevee!: 14.66 million\nRing Fit Adventure: 14.54 million\nMario Kart 8 Deluxe had the biggest jump in this list, selling 1.48 million units this quarter. According to Nintendo, new 2022 releases are also selling well.

Amazon Luna joins an ever-growing list of cloud-gaming services that already include the likes of Google Stadia, Xbox Cloud Gaming, Nvidia GeForce Now, and more in the Samsung Gaming Hub.\nThe hub, which was added to all 2022 models in late June, collects your various catalogs of cloud entitlements on one screen with no additional hardware required. That means if you own one game's entitlement on Google Stadia but another's rights on Amazon Luna, you can access them through the same hub without the need for any consoles. Not only that, but you can play these games using any supported Bluetooth controller.\nAmazon Luna offers various subscription plans, with the top-tier subscription, Luna+, offering access to triple-A titles from publishers like Sega and Capcom as well as various independent titles. If you're an Amazon Prime subscriber, you can access a rotating collection of titles. This month's offerings include Control: Ultimate Edition, Myst, Steel Assault, and Garfield Kart. You can also add Ubisoft+ to your subscription for an additional cost to play games in franchises like Assassin's Creed, Watch Dogs, Ghost Recon, and Far Cry. \nThrough the addition of Amazon Luna to the library of cloud-gaming services, Samsung Gaming Hub now offers more than 1,000 games to choose from. I came away impressed from my time with the company's new gaming initiative at Summer Game Fest this year. You can read my full impressions of my experience with the cloud-based gaming feature here.",

While it has shown some flash on the court and tantalized with RPG systems in MyCareer, it has a long way to go to reach the championship form we celebrated years ago. Last year's game was a step in the right direction that laid the foundation for a promising future with a more dynamic defensive game, better perimeter play for smaller players, and great depth found in The City and MyTeam. It'll be interesting to see if Visual Concepts can build off of these gains in NBA 2K23 and continue to innovate on the court, and find ways to better integrate the WNBA into its modes. As always, making VC less intrusive is a necessity.\nWe still don't have insight into any of this year's modes – other than the Jordan Challenge returning with 15 flashback moments from Michael Jordan's career – but we do know what to expect from gameplay. Visual Concepts uses the word \"authenticity\" to sum up this year's changes, which appear to apply a high level of realism to little interactions between players and how the ball is handled. Here are the key additions and changes you can expect to see on the court when NBA 2K23 launches on September 9:\nEasier Play\nMore Pro for the Pro Stick\nHang on the Rim\nShooting is a Weapon\nKilling Stalls with Adrenaline \nDefensive Play\nImproved A.I.\nBadges Sound More Confusing But Better?\nPurchase",

Dubbed Midnight Society, the studio's first project was slated to be a multiplayer shooter. More details about it have been released, including word that it's a PvPvE extraction shooter. \nNow, Midnight Society's first game has a name – Deadrop – and gameplay footage. This gameplay comes from players who had (very) early access to the title, so it's less of a demo or vertical slice of gameplay and more of a proof of concept. Check it out for yourself in the tweets below from Okami Games. \nHere's another gameplay clip in a different firing range. #DEADROP pic.twitter.com/odT5QHYtFp\nJuly 30, 2022\nOne more clip showing the outdoor areas and world design.\n@oOStep_Oo for the clips, go give him a follow!#DEADROP pic.twitter.com/5XGN5uPSxx\nJuly 30, 2022\nAs you can see, the gameplay as it stands today consists of a firing range with a single weapon. You can catch glimpses of the world design, too, and it looks somewhat cyberpunk-y. Only time will tell what the final product will look like, as all signs point to this game being years away from release. \nThe reception to the gameplay has been less than great, to say the least. It doesn't help that Beahm tweeted, \"I can take a screenshot right now...blows out anything from the [Call of Duty] engine\" back in June because this game does not appear to stack up against Call of Duty's visuals. Perhaps it will one day, but that remains to be seen. \nWhat do you think of Deadrop's gameplay? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "The year 2020 was a big year for the Cyberpunk genre in video games because the hotly-anticipated (and long-in-development) Cyberpunk 2077 was finally released that year. However, it wasn't the massive generation-defining game CD Projekt Red (and admittedly, many of us fans) propped it up to be. \nI played it on Xbox Series X at release, and it ran fine enough that I could roll credits thinking I had just completed a fun game that I'm glad I played. However, getting an Xbox Series X or a PlayStation 5 around the time Cyberpunk 2077 was released in 2020 was challenging, and many had to play CDPR's latest RPG on last-gen consoles. You probably already know the story of how that went – it was not a good game to play on last-gen consoles at all.

          "description": "The PlayStation 5 has been the current Sony console for just under two years, having been released on November 12, 2020, in the U.S. At launch, there were a number of new features associated with the console such as Game Help cards, Activity Cards, and several others. \nOne of those new features was the Accolades system. If you’re like me, you didn’t know this feature existed before it made its way into headlines today. As for why it’s in headlines, it’s because the launch feature is being discontinued in “the fall of 2022,” according to Sony. \n“In fall of 2022, the Accolades feature on PlayStation 5 will no longer be supported,” an update from Sony reads. “The feature hasn’t seen the level of usage we anticipated, so we are refocusing our efforts. We encourage the community to continue to send positive messages to one another.” \nIf you’re curious about what Accolades was in light of its forthcoming discontinuation, it allowed players to give accolades and positive encouragement to other players they came across online. You could give another player a Helpful, Welcoming, or Good Sport accolade based on what it was like playing with them. You were allowed to give one accolade per match and you could only give them to players who weren’t your friends. As for why, well, Sony kept track of your accolades and other players could view them. \nYou’ve now only got a few months (maybe even less) to secure as many of these accolades as possible or you could just ignore the feature, which is probably what you’ve been doing the past two years (whether you knew it or not).\nIn the meantime, read our thoughts on the latest PlayStation exclusive game in Game Informer’s Stray review. \nHave you ever used the PS5 Accolades feature?

Thousands of people called in within the first day of the hotline launching, and from EA's snarky Twitter tone, it would appear most of them are complaints, likely about a beloved players rating being too low or a hated players rating being too high.\nShoutout to the thousands of fans who called into the #Madden23 Ratings Hotline yesterday to let us know they 𝓐𝓖𝓡𝓔𝓔 with our ratings☎️😉\nJuly 29, 2022\nAccording to Emma Waldren, Madden’s creator of content strategy and partnerships, over 1,000 people called in within just six hours.\n1000 of you called the #Madden23 #RatingsAdjustor hotline in the first six hours 🤯\nJuly 29, 2022\nSome NFL players also got involved to joke around about the ratings, clearly with EA's involvement.\nTell me why a #RatingsAdjustor thinks I got no hands with the 72 catch rating...\n@EAMaddenNFL fixes that! #EAathlete pic.twitter.com/7irw42kSLZ\nJuly 29, 2022\n89 speed for the fastest edge in the league?!\n#RatingsAdjustor get it right #EAathlete pic.twitter.com/rXJwP65TjE\nJuly 29, 2022\nYo @EAMaddenNFL I’m only heading into year 2 and you’re already fleecing me on ratings!!\n#RatingsAdjustor and get me right #EAathlete pic.twitter.com/uHE9xnAS9X\nJuly 28, 2022\nThe hotline is a fun way to interact with fans and draw attention to this year's ratings.

The trailer dives into the game's fourth region, Sumeru, which is home to people who can't dream and worship the God of Wisdom.\nSuermu looks lush in foliage, with mushroom creatures scurrying about the trunks of sizable trees. It also contains a desert area and looks to be just as sizable as the game's other areas.\nThe trailer also introduces a host of companion characters that players will meet as quests are completed. The first new character is Tighnari, a forest watcher who we see holding a magical firefly. In Port Ormos, players will run into Alhaitham from the Haravatat in the Akademiya. Further into the game, players meet Dehya of the Desertfolk, who is also a mercenary for the Emerites. There are also Nilou, a character who is pursuing art and dance, Nahida, a mysterious being, and Cyno, the General Mahamatra.\nAll of this content is a part of Genshin Impact's 03 update, which doesn't have a release date yet, but appears to be close, given how much miHoYo has revealed. Genshin Impact is currently available on PlayStation consoles and PC, and works just as well on Android, and iOS.\nAre you still invested in Genshin Impact?

Players control an investigative reporter guided by a mysterious voice over the radio to explore abandoned Japanese facilities nestled within an island forest teeming with prehistoric wildlife. These dinos are highly intelligent and realistically behave like animals, featuring what Great Ape describes as self-preservation and reactive systemic AI behaviors. \n\n\nPlayers can use stealth to avoid detection while exploring, create distractions, or repel dinos using items like flares and makeshift, non-lethal weaponry. You’ll spend much of the game scrounging for materials as you traverse ruins for clues about the island’s history and how you ended up in this dire situation. \nAccording to the game’s FAQ, The Lost Wild won’t be arriving until late 2024 or early 2025.

She uses her trusty mech suit to keep the bad guys at bay, which players can customize with various offensive and defensive components. These include various guns, a laser sword, missile launchers, riot shields, boosters, and more. \nWhen you're not blasting apart enemies, you'll take care of your homestead. This rundown garage can be upgraded with new supply and water lines, and you can grow food, raise animals, and manufacture ammo for your mech.\nBounty Star will arrive on PlayStation and Xbox platforms (launching day one on Game Pass), Switch, and PC and launches in 2023.",

          "description": "Thirsty Suitors kicked off the Annapurna Showcase with a new gameplay explainer breaking down its uniquely presented battle system and a surprising exploration segment. \nThe game, which premiered during last year's Game Awards, centers on Jala, a young woman who must reconcile with her exes and friends while dealing with ( or, more specifically, disappointing ) her demanding parents before her sister's wedding. The game revolves around a turn-based battle system where Jala faces a former lover, which reimagines their attempts to find common ground as an RPG battle.\n\n\nThe trailer showed off moves such as Thirsty Taunts to manipulate an ex's emotions. Your old flames can manifest their inflated egos into alternate realities, where they reign supreme as the exaggerated versions of their self-perceptions. Thankfully, you knock them down a peg by enlisting the help of family members as if they were Final Fantasy summons, such as a giant version of Jala's mother dishing out significant damage. Battles conclude not with a knockout but with Jala and her adversary working out their issues.\nThirst Suitors features a variety of gameplay mechanics outside of battles, namely skateboarding. Certain segments allow Jala to skate and grind rails, build combos, and execute stunts to build up a score. It's a surprising addition that harkens to Tony Hawk or Jet Set Radio, and the game also features other unique gameplay shifts. \nA Steam demo goes live later today if you're still on the fence about Thirsty Suitors. The game has only been confirmed for PC so far and has no release window.",

          "description": "The Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake, teased initially with a brief trailer back in 2021, is reportedly on indefinite development hold. That’s the news as reported by Bloomberg earlier today, which cited unnamed sources close to its development, relaying that the project has been paused.\nThe problems reportedly stem from major staff departures at developer, Aspyr Media. Specifically, both the art director and the design director were unexpectedly let go from the company. A recent vertical slice demo of the game was well received by license holders. However, later messaging to the rest of the development team suggested that the project wasn’t where studio leadership wanted it to be.\nDevelopers at Aspyr are reportedly now stating that 2025 would be a realistic time frame to expect the project to release. \nStar Wars: Knights of the Old Republic holds a special place in video game history. The original 2003 game was a significant milestone in successful and original video game storytelling in the Star Wars franchise and featured a memorable twist regarding a main character’s identity. The game also helped popularize some of the choice-driven and moral decision-making that became so popular in later games like Mass Effect.\nThe remake is highly anticipated by longtime fans, but its future now appears murky.\n[Source: Bloomberg]",

          "description": "WWE’s SummerSlam event takes place this Saturday, and Epic is getting in the mood by announcing that 16-time world champion John Cena will five-knuckle shuffle his way into Fortnite.\nCena arrives on July 28 and comes outfitted in his full-on entrance gear as well as his shirtless in-ring gear. You can pick up a set that includes a “you can’t see me” emote, WWE Championship Title Back Bling, and Five Digit Slapper pickaxe. Personally, I’m chuckling at the idea of the PG-friendly Cena adjusting attitudes with guns instead of bodyslams. \nWhile Cena isn’t the first wrestler to appear in Fornite – Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson has him beat there – it’s cool to see regardless, and, as a wrestling fan, I hope this trend continues. Fortnite already acts as the ultimate “forbidden door” for various media properties, so let's throw more sports entertainment into the mix by adding stars from WWE, AEW, Impact, New Japan, and other promotions. That would certainly entice me to dive back into action. \nDo you plan on chasing victory royales as Big Match John? Let us know in the comments!",

          "description": "Sony released a PlayStation Blog post fleshing out some of the new features for its upcoming PlayStation VR2 headset. \nPS VR2 now sports a see-through view. By hitting a button or using the Card in the Control Center, you can disable game footage and see your surroundings without removing the headset. This is thanks to the device’s embedded front cameras, making it less of a hassle when you need to check on something in the real world. Sony also notes that this mode is for viewing only; you can’t use it to record. You can, however, broadcast yourself while playing PS VR2 games by connecting a PS5 HD camera to the consoles. \nThe play area, as in the virtual boundaries allotted for VR play, can now be customized. You can use the headset cameras and Sense controllers to scan the room and dynamically map out the play space to your liking. These settings are then saved until you move to a different play area. \nLastly, PS VR2 sports two viewing modes: VR and Cinematic. VR mode displays VR content in a 360 degree view in 4000 x 2040 HDR video format (2000 x 2040 per eye) and 90Hz/120Hz frame rate. Cinematic Mode lets players view non-VR media and the PS5 interface in 1920×1080 HDR video format with 24/60Hz and 120Hz frame rate.\nPlayStation VR2 still doesn’t have a release window, but Sony promises to share more information “soon.” That includes its launch line-up, which is said to consist of at least 20 games. Titles being developed for the headset include Horizon: Call of the Mountain, ports of Resident Evil Village and No Man’s Sky, and The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners Ch. 2.\nWhat do you think of these features for PlayStation VR2?

Years after seeing the action JRPG’s numerous endings and earning the platinum trophy, I never expected to miss out on so many well-kept mysteries. However, an Automata player recently discovered a secret room leaving hardcore dataminers baffled and excited. \nSomeone randomly posted a video on the Nier Automata subreddit showing they found a secret room in the Copied City. So far no one else has worked out how they managed to make this secret door appear. Literally 1 person on earth has accessed this room and we are uttered mind blown pic.twitter.com/g7W4JxiNDg\nJuly 25, 2022\nRandomly uploaded to Reddit by user sadfutago (thanks, Eurogamer!), the video in the tweet above shows them sprinting past droids in the Copied City and interacting with an inconspicuous section of the back wall. After sliding down a ladder and whooshing through distorted corridors, sadfutago enters a \"holy\" site. I'll let you see what that is for yourself.  There are unimportant items along the way, and there's not much to do other than look around. Still, the community is shocked that something of this nature remained hidden for so long. \nFamed dataminer Lance McDonald – you might remember them as the player who unearthed Automata's best-kept secret – spoke for everyone when they said, \"So far no one else has worked out how [sadfutago] managed to make this secret door appear. Literally 1 person on earth has accessed this room and we are utterly mind blown.\" McDonald also said that it's impossible to mod the game this way, refuting the claims of swaths of naysayers. \nIs this an area Platinum Games intended, or is it a ruse designed and implemented by players? What do you think? Let us know in the comments below! \n[Source: Eurogamer]",

However, developer Daedalic Entertainment is taking a few more months to polish up Gollum's solo adventure. \nFans have been critical of Gollum's perceived lack of quality, especially after a recent gameplay trailer where the game looked rough around the edges. Daedalic seems to have taken those concerns to heart. The studio didn't reveal a new release date, only saying it's delaying the game \"by a few months.\" \nHere is the complete delay statement: \n \n\nFirst of all, we would like to thank all of you for your patience and support so far. Over the last few years, our team has been working hard to bring you a remarkable story in a breathtaking world, fill with magic and wonder.\n\nWe are dedicated to meeting our community's expectations and uncovering the untold story of Gollum in a way that honors the vision of J.R.R. Tolkien.\n\nThat being said, in order to deliver the best possible experience, we have decided to push the release of The Lord of the Rings: Gollum by a few months. We will update you with an exact timing in the near future.\n\nWe are grateful for our passionate community and we cannot wait to share this unique adventure with you soon!\n\nDaedalic Entertainment\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: Gollum was announced in 2019 and chronicles Gollum's life after he loses the One Ring during the early chapters of The Fellowship of the Ring. The game emphasizes platforming and stealth as players climb and sneak across environments. Players can attack enemies depending on if they side with the character's Gollum or Smeagol personalities. \nDo you think The Lord of the Rings: Gollum needs a delay? Let us know in the comments!",
