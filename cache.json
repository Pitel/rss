This, of course, means that it has once again been time to name The Hero of Time.\nFor many, there is an obvious answer to this one: Link. That is the name of the series' lead protagonist, so that is the name that many a dedicated Hylian explorer opts for (bar the odd save file all in lowercase or, in some instances, a file where everyone appears to shout the hero's name as he goes by, \"LINK\").\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Later Alligator is one such game I picked up for that very reason as the goofy gators in the game’s trailer and screenshots initially caught my attention. The animation is great for sure, but one thing I was not expecting is how funny and utterly charming this point-and-click adventure is.\nRead more",

          "description": "Too many spells in games are just variations on the old reliable fireball. Wizard sends projectile towards target. Target dies. Perhaps they deviate a little in how quickly they die, or how large the area of effect is. Maybe instead of a fireball it's a thunderbolt, or a poisonous gas, or a beam of light. Pish, I say. Pish! Where's the real magic? Where are the cataclysmic spells that take days or weeks of preparation, and then change the world with a single fateful ritual?\nThese games could learn something from The Last Spell, a roguelite turn-based tactics game about defending your village each night from hordes of mutant beasts that emerge from the purple fog surrounding the entire world. Whenever I start a new game in The Last Spell, I always rewatch the excellent opening sequence, which succinctly sets a harrowing scene of magic pushed further than we're used to seeing in most fiction in general, let alone games.\nRead more",

For six hours, you do this, and eat your dinner feeling sick with unrealised potential.\nMatch-3 games are compulsive for a reason, and I don't have beef with them as a concept. I actually like them! But I don't like that to play a match-3 game I usually have to play a mobile game that wants me to spent money on Fairy Dollars so I can buy barrels of Explosive Wand Dust, making it easier to earn stars and incrementally furnish the Magic Toilet Goblin's bedroom, or whatever. It's the empty consumerism vibe of freemium mobile games that makes me feel like I've been eating the time-spending equivalent of junk food. Spirit Swap, which has a demo out now in the form of an endless mode, isn't that.

Most of its parts are made to a high standard, it's tragic that its final design just doesn't work at all.\nOf all things, IOT reminds me of Fragile Allegiance. You're a 'founder', sent to an already colonised and abandoned Titan to build a new city at the behest of the Council. You're a 'founder', sent to an already colonised and abandoned Titan to build a new city at the behest of the Council. First, by salvaging its ruined buildings for minerals and isotopes, then mining for surface deposits, all of which goes back into your building resources. Curiously, you never combine two resources to produce a third, you can only upgrade minerals through a tier system. Higher tier resources are more potent, meaning, for exmaple, a building site will accept 100 raw minerals or four higher tier units. It’s a bit strange, but it mostly works. Double clicking on your starting buildings summons an interior view, where you lay out machinery, little modules for workers and storage, power pylons and so on.\nRead more",

When faced with a self-imposed task as massive and daunting as writing a retrospective on The Sims franchise, going back to the very first game was the obvious launchpad. The original The Sims — now sometimes called The Sims 1 for the sake of clarity — was released in February 2000, and received regular updates via expansion packs through to October 2003. The game was the brainchild of Will Wright, the designer behind the SimCity series, who had decided to approach the world of his popular city-building franchise from a new angle. Switching from macro- to micro-management, Wright's new spin-off project aimed to focus on the architectural design of individual houses. As time went on, his creative interests would shift again, to also take in the lives of the people inside the buildings.\nRead more",

          "description": "A lot (most) of the magic games we're highlighting this week are in some manner lovely and nice, because witches these days tend towards the cottagecore (ily, Little Witch In The Woods!). It's nice that witches have changed in our minds to \"unmarried lady who lives alone and is good with herbs and cats :]\", when they used to be \"unmarried lady who lives alone and is good with herbs and her cat is the devil and she has sex with the devil\".\nThere's still room for witches with some threat to 'em, though, and I love a weird horror game, so you can imagine that when I heard about The Salt Order my interest was immediately piqued. It's a low-poly PS1-style game where an order of witches has tasked you with retrieving a grimoire from a cursed realm of endless trees. You are largely defenceless, except for the ability to draw on the ground with salt. \"In many stories that I knew as a child, salt was one of the very powerful magical protective elements against evil spirits,\" solo dev Khamelot tells me over email. \"During invocations, drawing a circle of salt could act as a basic protection. To prevent the spirits from entering one's home, you could put salt in front of the openings of the house.\"\nRead more",

Looking at both the popular upcoming demo list and the most wishlisted list, survival crafting game Voidtrain sits comfortably in second place on both. I decided to download the demo and see what the fuss was about, and wow, is Voidtrain completely wild.\nI thought Voidtrain might be relatively new, but it's actually been knocking around for a couple of years. It’s been in early access on the Epic Games Store since 2021, and after announcing a Steam release for October 2022, the game got indefinitely delayed. Voidtrain's Steam page currently has a vague release date of sometime in 2023, but the demo is a good reason enough to check it out while the team is still tightening some loose screws.\nRead more",

Enter The Knight Witch, which takes the thrill of the bullet hell shooter and wraps it up in a lovely Metroid-like-shaped package my brain can actually understand.

Shampoo, bubble bath and toothpaste. Salad cream, yeast and lemonade. These concoctions were the result of pure genius, a brilliant mind capable of harmonising with ingredients on a sub-atomic level to create combinations that were beyond the capabilities of any known god. My Mam was only shouting at me because she didn’t understand. These were my elixirs! Sup from this bowl and taste the future of human evolution! Yes, I know this is the same bowl we’re also sick into when we’re not feeling well, but you also bake in it so let’s not start being picky. \r\n\n\r\nAs I got older, It became apparent my future was not in alchemy. Someone who puts baby corn into a bolognese clearly doesn't posses the skill to create balanced mixtures. And yet, Potionomics has wrenched the rotting corpse of that childhood fantasy right out of its grave. Finally, here is a suitable outlet for my feats of fantastical alchemy.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Everything I've seen of Frame Break's futuristic life sim looks delightful so far, and in a recent ID@Xbox showcase, the developers told us a bit more about how it's going to operate, and whether those Stardew Valley comparisons are on the money. \nWhen asked whether players would be able to befriend NPCs like other Stardew-likes, Frame Break's CEO Joakim Hedström told us: \"In short, yes. We don't have a full town like Stardew, but the characters that are there, you'll be able to get to know better and learn their stories.\"\nRead more",

But he also said Studio Ghibli's animated film Spirited Away was another key influence, which, yep, that definitely tracks. \n\"I was very inspired by Studio Ghibli films, and especially the film Spirited Away,\" Stjärnljus told us. \"That's been kind of like a guiding star from the beginning in terms of tonality with this serious, emotional story, but [also] still, like, a fun quirkiness to it, and really this sense of exploring another world, which we really want.\" \nRead more",

If the answer to that last part is yes, you need to move on to the question of how.\nIn practice, Potion Tales is a 3D puzzle game. People come to you - I use the term people broadly because the tutorial level involves helping a fire spirit and soon after you're approached by what appears to be an aggressive daisy who is the local gravekeeper - and present you with a problem. They ask for a potion to solve the problem. That's all the steer you get. It takes some getting used to, but the Steam demo shows an impressively flexible game with a good sense of humour.\nRead more",

This Duke wasn't the purple-shirted acrobat I'd known from Apogee Software's pair of platformers earlier that decade. He was brash, crude, and and didn't side-scroll anymore. It wasn't for me, so I moved on to other games. I still occasionally loaded up those earlier platformers though, wistfully remembering a time when Duke presumably used actual toilets when he needed to answer a call of nature.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Good gravy, did I love that case. Tightly proportioned without being too cramped for a full-size graphics card, maturely designed without looking dull, and hewn from some of most gorgeously textured matte steel I’ve seen on a piece of computing hardware. Don’t even get me started on the upgraded Source 340 Elite. It’s been years since these cases disappeared from sale and ascended to Component Heaven, and although it’s taken a few tries, there’s finally a new chassis that’s worthy of the legacy: the NZXT H5 Flow.\nRead more",

If you haven't had a chance to check that post out yet, I'd love to hear what you think of it. And yes, fixing our comments nesting is still very much on the agenda as well. Our tech team have a lot of websites to take care of these days, and they're working as fast as they can to sort things out. As soon as I have an update I can share, I'll let you know. \nBut enough about techy bits. I wanted to use this Letter From The Editor to talk about some of the more supporter-oriented things mentioned in that 'What's coming up' post. Specifically, I want to kick off the inaugural Ask RPS - your chance to ask us, the editorial team, questions about games, the site, the way we do things, and other things we like. \nRead more",

The jokey dating-sim-but-everyone's-a-talking-table type vein never quite grabbed me. Unless Monster Prom counts? Hmm.\r\n\nRaptor Boyfriend is more the lighthearted comedy kind, but with through lines on social anxiety and navigating confusing coming-of-age relationships. It is also not actually about having a raptor boyfriend.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Though it attributes Retro staff, as well as Airship Images Limited, Gamesim, Iron Galaxy Studios, and others who worked on the project, it does close with one solitary block for the original GameCube game and the Wii version.\nFormer developer Jack Mathews called it a travesty, not just for his own work on the original that could have been replaced, but for others' that may have stuck through to the final remaster.\nThe credits issue in games\nGames have, historically, had issues with crediting the work developers have done on them. Reports at sites like Kotaku have highlighted how credit for contributions have been used as both rewards and punitive measures.\nMetroid as a series even encountered this with Dread, as several developers claimed they weren't credits for their work on the project.

The stream will take place on March 9.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ2hZ-4JCTE&ab_channel=Nacon\nOriginally announced in the summer of 2021, RoboCop: Rogue City will see The Future of Law Enforcement laying down the Prime Directives in the city of Old Detroit. Fans are hoping that the title will capture the ridiculous violence and biting satire of Paul Verhoeven's fantastic 1987 movie. Actor Paul Weller is confirmed to be on board to provide his voice and likeness to the irreplaceable Alex Murphy.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYrJdAdi1WI&ab_channel=PlayStation\nThe Lord of the Rings: Gollum is an action-RPG that has unfortunately fallen into something of a development spiral, having been delayed several times since its initial announcement. Initially slated for launch in 2021 and then 2022, Daedalic Entertainment is yet to announce an official launch date for The Precious' arrival on PC and console platforms. Perhaps this Nacon Connect will finally mark the calendar with ink, giving LOTR fans something particularly intriguing to look forward to.\nIn addition to RoboCop: Rogue City and The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, the Nacon Connect will feature appearances from Robin Hood-themed multiplayer title Gangs of Sherwood, motorbike sim TT3: Ride on the Edge, psychological WWI horror Ad Infinitum, and fantasy roguelike Ravenswatch. We can also expect to see the latest from the publisher's line of gaming hardware and accessories, including headphones, microphones, and keyboards.\nYou can check out the stream over on the official Nacon YouTube channel on March 9, with the action scheduled to kick off at 10:00 PT / 13:00 ET / 18:00 BST.\nThe post We’ll see RoboCop: Rogue City at Nacon Connect next month appeared first on Destructoid.",

This figure, if correct, is believed to be around double the value of the previous deal between the two participants. The new contract will reportedly last for six years and will see EA retain its role as the lead partner of the Premier League, while also retaining its licensing for the use of 20 UK teams and their corresponding players.\nAs for FIFA itself, the group has previously suggested that it intends to launch its own football game franchise, and is currently seeking a developer for this as-yet-untitled new series. Ultimately, the long-running and incredibly popular \"FIFA\" experience lies with the talent of EA Sports, and while the transition period for EA Sports FC will be a little clunky, EA is expected to go above and beyond to ensure that its annual football releases remain a hugely lucrative part of its portfolio.\nPremier League closes in on £500m deal with EA Sports [Sky Sports / GamesIndustry.biz]\nThe post EA reportedly to sign £488 million Premier League deal for post-FIFA series appeared first on Destructoid.",

No specific reason was given in today's announcement.\nhttps://twitter.com/deadislandgame/status/1625147886643150852\nThis does push Dead Island 2 away from Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, which had also locked in an April 28 date.

Delays are usually more common, as teams need a few extra weeks to polish, tighten the screws, and put the final touches on a multi-year project. Still, we do see it from time-to-time. The gnarly Scorn moved its date up by a week last year, Martial arts brawler Sifu also bumped its date up a bit before launch, too.\nStill, for Dead Island 2, it's a bit of a surprise. First revealed at E3 2014, the zombified sequel has shambled through the years, eventually arriving at Dambuster Studios. The team there has finally got it together and ready to move out the door though, and it may be heartening for fans to see them so ready to hit the gas on the Dead Island sequel.\nWe'll find out whether Dead Island 2 and its motley crew of slayers can truly stick the landing a little bit earlier than expected. Dead Island 2 is now slated to launch on April 21, 2023 on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.\nThe post Dead Island 2 goes gold and moves its launch up a week appeared first on Destructoid.",

Movie — And this latest preview was a real treat for old-school Nintendo fans, as it featured the return of the \"Super Mario Bros. Rap\".\nFor folks younger than my aging self, the Super Mario Bros. Rap featured as the title music to the choppy (it was) animated series Super Mario. Bros Super Show, which originally aired way back in 1989. The show was famed for producing short, rubbish adventures, which were sandwiched between some wild, live-action bumper segments. These moments famously featured WWE star Captain Lou Albano as Mario and Canadian actor Danny Wells as Luigi. Once, Elvira showed up, though the Mistress of the Dark is yet to make her official Mario game debut. Sadness.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu57M7cjSD4&ab_channel=Illumination\nThe new Super Bowl ad features the rap as a backing track to a \"Real World\" advertisement for the Mario Bros. plumbing services, promoting their fast, speedy, and low-cost pipe repair. This then gives way to a new montage of clips from the upcoming movie, with a look at some fun and familiar platforming sections, a Smash Bros.-style showdown, and, of course, a ride down the Rainbow Road. The Super Mario Bros. Movie stars Chris Pratt as Mario, and will also feature luminaries such as Anya Taylor-Joy (Peach), Keegan Michael-Key (Toad), Jack Black (Bowser), Seth Rogan (Donkey Kong), and Charlie Day (Luigi).\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie is scheduled to launch in theaters in the UK and Europe in late-March. It will premiere in North America on April 7. So far, it's looking to be a perfectly fun piece of entertainment.\nThe post Super Bowl Super Mario Bros. Movie trailer brings back ‘Super Show Rap’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

It will be something of a shorter affair this time around, as I'm still technically off work — an endeavor that I have only been somewhat successful in maintaining. But, even when I'm not supposed to be here, I'm still gonna rock up for WBP? Not only is each and everyone one of you more than worth the time and effort, but, hey, I got a streak to maintain. So thanks for showing out this Saturday, and here's to a fine week for you all.\nto say...\nPlaying games for review. I guess that still counts as work, right? But time, tide, and embargoes wait for no man, and thus I've been bouncing between two games in lieu of upcoming reviews. The first is 110 Industries' silly slasher Wanted: Dead, which you can read all about next week, while the second is Inti Creates rat-a-tat-tat anime actioner Grim Guardians: Demon Purge, which is still a little ways away. I have much to say about both of these titles. Still, I'm afraid you'll have to hang on for the obligatory designated timestamp to pass before I can spill the beans on these particularly unique releases.\nI love you...\nAnywhoooo, I only have a mere two days left on my holiday — a holiday that has whizzed by at ungrateful speed — and thus I better get to trying to enjoy them. I will, of course, be sure to dive into all of your comments, so join the point and tell the community Whatcha Been Playing? There's sure been a lot of news and excitement so far this year, and hopefully, you've found something to get your gaming brain in gear for 2023. Tell us all about it, and share your thoughts. The World wants to hear it. And if it doesn't, we'll just force 'em to listen anyway.

          "description": "Rowr, Fsss! Fsss!\nMovie-licensed games have long been given a bad rap, but to be fair to them, that’s only because they’re usually bad. This goes back to the ‘80s, with some of the earliest video games to hit the market. I don’t have an explanation for why these titles are often bad. The fact that they have to be rushed to meet the same release date as the movie certainly does no favors. However, my theory is that, when a game already has advertising that comes from a larger industry, why even bother trying to make it good? It’s going to sell on recognition alone.\nWith that in mind, here we have 2004’s Catwoman, based on the film starring Halle Berry. It has the distinction of being based off what is considered by some to be one of the worst big-budget films of all time. It would be really…",

Released in 1998 for the N64 before getting ported to PC and Dreamcast, it was unconventional, to say the least. While the name is probably supposed to remind you of Tetris, there’s a lot more to it than trying to wipe out a wall of tetrominoes. The goal is to wall up areas to hold water, and doing a good job rewards you with ducks. I think we can all agree that ducks are a pretty great reward. They’re like chill geese that won’t drag your child away.\nIf Wetrix was easily overlooked, its 2000 sequel blended in with the carpeting. Despite enjoying the original and knowing the existence of a follow-up, I only recently got around to trying it. That’s because it’s not named Wetrix 2 in North America. It’s Aqua A…",

          "description": "The rules are simple, yet frightening...\nHaving treated us to a couple of bonafide back-to-back classics in January, retro-loving publisher Hamster is kicking off the new month with something especially obscure for the Arcade Archives, with the arrival of Seta/Allumer's digital card game Magical Speed, now available on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.\nHitting the Japanese coin-op scene in 1994, Magical Speed is an anime-infused version of the classical \"Speed\" card game, which sees two players go head-to-head in a race to shed their respective hands as quickly as possible. Players simultaneously attempt to match cards in their deck with the top card in a central pool — constantly pulling from a side deck in a bid to be the first to deplete all cards in hand. It's simpler than yer boy is making it sound, but perhaps not so much when presented in Japanese by shouting anime characters\nDeal yourself a hand in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber edzvision.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_dVkoBuOrM&ab_channel=edzvision\nMagical Speed, which was generally presented in cocktail cabinet form, follows the rules of the tabletop classic but adds cutesy characters and a thin \"adventure\" storyline, as a hero makes their way through a fantasy kingdom, taking on a variety of opponents. As this Arcade Archives release represents the Japanese ROM, there is no English localization, although an English manual is included. While perhaps the nichest Arcade Archives release in some time, this obscure oddity is worth a look for traditional card game fans. Who knows, you might end up searching for cocktail cabinets on eBay.\nMagical Speed is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nThe post Obscure card title Magical Speed presents its hand to the Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s shaping up to be – how do I put this politely? – a game.\nHoly Ocean is described as an open-world FPS where you explore an ocean of meat on a bicycle. Along the way, you discover islands that look like human body-parts while fighting creatures and bosses. It sounds like Rose, a side character from Golden Light and protagonist of the side-story, Golden Light of Rose, will play a central role. The world is said to be “handmade” and “fully destructible.”\n[embed]https://youtu.be/YuYipiUeXjk[/embed]\nMr. Pink has been noodling around with a few concepts lately. He’s shown off a bit of Holy Ocean previously under the name “Goldendola.” Aside from that, Mech Punk is another unique one available on Steam Early Access. He’s also demonstrated a concept for a dog-walking RPG. Sounds like a good way to stretch yourself thin, but Mech Punk gets updated so often, I don’t know how he has time to sleep. I guess a person needs to keep themselves occupied after fleeing Russia.\nGolden Light was one of my favorite games released in 2022. The dark-weird, meatpunk style of Mr. Pink is an aesthetic I can get behind, so I’ve been keeping an eye on what’s being worked on.\nHoly Ocean is available to be wishlisted on Steam.

Today, 2 Player Productions and Double Fine Productions premiered Double Fine PsychOdyssey, a detailed documentary following the development of Psychonauts 2.\nUp on both YouTube and the Internet Archive, Double Fine PsychOdyssey is 32 episodes long, with some pretty hefty runtimes. Alongside following the development of Psychonauts 2, there's also a mini-movie in the middle following Amnesia Fortnight, the studio's special brainstorming and prototyping event it holds every so often.\nMuch like Double Fine Adventure did with the development of Broken Age, Double Fine PsychOdyssey looks to be a pretty deep and also human look into the creation of a game. You can see a little bit of it in the trailer here.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRlI72bsNRc\nMaking the game\nIt's good to see transparency in how games are made, and how the people who make them go through the process. You'd be hard-pressed to find as interesting a subject as Double Fine, too.\nThe development of Psychonauts 2 took a while, and a lot happened for Double Fine over the course of it. Getting a look into how those events panned out, as well as how the team tackled making a sequel to the original Psychonauts, certainly sounds like it would be an interesting watch.\nMost of the Double Fine PsychOdyssey episodes are pretty long, so settle in for a watch.

          "description": "All my friends are heathens\nSaint Maker, the new visual novel from Yangyang Mobile, is set to drop on PC and Switch on February 22, 2023. The press release tells me that this date is significant because it’s Ash Wednesday, but as a Canadian, that just tells me that February 21st is Pancake Tuesday.\nI probably lost a fair few of you at the word “Mobile,” but it’s necessary to highlight this game for a very important reason: Yangyang Mobile is the developer that brought us Perfect Gold, a game that came out in 2021 that I still haven’t shut up about.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/pcLijhOfBbI[/embed]\nHowever, while Perfect Gold was a beautiful yuri love story, Saint Maker has its sights set on horrifying you rather than warming your heart. It tells the story of Holly Beltran, who is attending a recollection at Saint Idelora’s convent when she starts witnessing strange hauntings. Saint Maker revolves around religious horror with a psychological twist. While there are interactive choices to be made, Yangyang Mobile has pegged the game at around 60,000 words and estimates it will take 4-6 hours to complete. Great information!\nWhile I would have been perfectly content if Yangyang Mobile wanted to keep feeding me yuri romance, I’m down for a little variety. This isn't their first foray into the horror genre, as they previously released The Letter in 2017.\nSaint Maker will be available on PC and Switch on February 22nd. It will be available for $13.99, but you can enjoy a 20% discount during its launch week.\nThe post Visual novel Saint Maker launches February 22nd appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Illumination has taken its promotion of The Super Mario Bros. Movie to the next level by launching a website and commercial promoting the brothers’ New York City plumbing business, and it's actually pretty cool. \nYou can visit the website here, which features a commercial promoting the Mario Bros. business. Older fans will likely recognize the catchy jingle as the theme song of the 1989 Super Mario Brothers Super Show, which is a nice homage. \n\n\nThe website also features humorous testimonials, job opportunities, and even a working phone number. Calling this number (929-55-MARIO) plays a recorded message by the Charlie Day-voiced Luigi, which provides a nice sample of his performance as the green-glad sidekick. Texting the number returns a message, which, depending on when you sent it, may return a digital poster for the movie. GI editor Kyle Hilliard got this Toad poster when he texted the number yesterday:\nIn my case, I only got a message thanking me for my interest in Super Mario Bros. Plumbing with a link to a form submission on the website. I'm not sure what you get for submitting this form, but feel free to find out yourselves. \nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie premieres in theaters on April 7. You can check out the official movie poster here. Watch the latest trailer featuring Donkey Kong and Cat Suit Mario here.",

Dambuster Studios has announced it’s bumping the game’s release from April 28 to April 21.\nThe news came in an announcement tweet declaring the game has gone gold, meaning it's essentially complete and ready to be printed on discs. Dead Island 2 had previously been scheduled to launch on February 3 before it was delayed to April 28. Speaking of April 28, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was recently pushed to that same day. It wouldn't be surprising if Dambuster moved its launch forward to steer clear of Star Wars' blast radius. \nYou asked for it, you got it. Dead Island 2 went gold and it's coming out a week early.\n#DeadIsland #SeeYouInHELLA pic.twitter.com/8Gu28bIcUS\nFebruary 13, 2023\nDead Island 2 earned a spot on Game Informer’s cover last month, and you can check out a month’s worth of exclusive features and videos by visiting our coverage hub here.",

Best of all, you can watch every episode right now. \nThe series, called PsychOdyssey, consists of a whopping 32 episodes, all of which are available to watch for free on Double Fine’s YouTube channel. Double Fine Adventure! earned praise for its raw, intimate look at the good, bad, and ugly sides of game development as the crew spent years filming in Double Fine's studio as Broken Age came together. Psychonauts 2's tumultous road to release, from crowdfunding campaigns to Microsoft's acquistion of Double Fine, makes its creation a fascinating subject, and we're excited to see how 2 Player Productions captured it. \n\n\nFor more on Psychonauts 2, you can read our review of the game here.

I liked what I saw in the initial trailer, sure, but what I found especially intriguing was that most of the game happens through a first-person view of someone driving an old station wagon through a beautiful but distraught Pacific Northwest forest. Rarely do driving games force a first-person view, and even fewer deviate from being a racer. \nPacific Drive does both, and after viewing roughly 30 minutes of gameplay during a virtual preview, I’m even more intrigued.

During today's Nintendo Direct, we got a new look at gameplay, plus the announcement of the Collector's Edition and a new Amiibo figure starring Link. However, we also got some unfortunate news surrounding the upcoming launch of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.\nIn its press release for the Nintendo Direct, Nintendo announced that the upcoming Zelda entry will retail for $69.99. This makes Nintendo the latest major publish to test the waters of raising the price of its triple-A titles in recent years. This follows other major publishers like 2K Games and PlayStation, who started pricing their major releases at $70 with the start of the new console generation in 2020. Last year, both Xbox and Ubisoft announced that their triple-A games would cost $70 going forward.\nWe reached out to Nintendo for comment regarding the reasoning for the price increase and if this will be the trend for its triple-A releases going forward, but did not immediately receive a response. We will update this story if Nintendo provides a statement.\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom launches on Switch on May 12.",

          "description": "\"Honestly speaking, I didn't want to do it.\"\nThose were the words of Capcom's Yasuhiro Ampo, the main director of the Resident Evil 4 remake. Alongside fellow director Kazunori Kadoi, their team has taken on the lofty task of reinventing the 2005 classic for a modern audience, recapturing the game's magic while also expanding it with new features. During our cover story interview with the two designers, they spoke candidly about the early phases of the game's development, their initial hesitation to tackle such an intimidating project, and how the team's approach in identifying areas for improvement gave them the confidence to see the project through. \nAmpo and Kadoi have plenty of experience working on Resident Evil.

The zany, creative, and often-irreverent games have proven to be crowd-pleasers over the last decade of annual iterations, with Jackbox Party Pack 9 releasing last October. Today, Jackbox Games announced a tenth edition of its party-game bundle, The Jackbox Party Pack 10, which will arrive this fall.\nLike its predecessors, The Jackbox Party Pack 10 promises five games that offer players the ability to be creative, funny, and intelligent, often in an effort to earn the approval of their competitors and/or spectators. While we don't know what games will be included in The Jackbox Party Pack 10, Jackbox games will announce and detail the included titles in the coming months. The included games will be playable in English, Spanish, French, German, and Italian.\nOn top of that, Jackbox Games will highlight one previous Party Pack per month in the lead-up to the launch of 10. These celebrations will include behind-the-scene glimpses, special livestreams with the development team, and discounts in the official Jackbox Games shop.\nThe Jackbox Party Pack 10 arrives on all major platforms this fall.",

There's no release date for the patch, nor does the message elaborate on the specifics of these improvements. \n“We are committed to making Forspoken the most enjoyable experience possible, and will provide an update about the timing of the next patch as soon as possible,” says Aramaki in the statement, which you can read in full below (click the image to enlarge). \nForspoken earned a 7.5 out of 10 review score from Game Informer, with editor Kyle Hilliard writing, “Forspoken's story and combat fail to reach the heights of its movement and exploration, but thankfully those two latter elements make up most of the experience. I sprinted, often literally, through the campaign in about 15 hours, and now I have a large world filled with nooks and crannies I'm eager to run through and explore. The narrative won’t linger with me, and I avoided combat in the open world often, but I loved making Frey leap and fly through Athia to discover all its treasure chests and secrets.” Check out our full review here.",

          "description": "To many, Cities: Skylines is the premier city-building simulation. When the PC launched in 2015, it quickly became a fan-favorite release for those who felt let down by modern SimCity titles. When the sim title arrived on consoles two years later, the less-intuitive controls didn't detract too much from the experience, enabling it to still deliver a terrific city-building experience. Now, developer Colossal Order and publisher Paradox Interview have announced Cities: Skylines Remastered, which improves the experience for console players in myriad ways.\nThis new version of Cities: Skylines aims to let players create bigger and better metropolises than ever before. In addition to the obvious graphical and performance upgrades enabled by the newer hardware, players can take their city-planning skills to the next level with up to 25 buildable tiles instead the 9 on PS4 and Xbox One versions. Additionally, players can look forward to a quick-selection tool, user-experience improvements like precision placements and updated snapping options, a new environmental control panel, a map editor, and the ability to place structures freely.\nPerhaps most importantly, anyone who owns the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One version and its DLC will receive Cities: Skylines Remastered and DLC (up to the Airports expansion) for free on their respective console family. Those who don't already own the last-gen console version can grab Cities: Skylines Remastered for $40.\nYou can see a very brief teaser rattling off some of the improvements the team made for this new version below.\n\n\nCities: Skylines Remastered arrives on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on February 15. The remastered versions of the DLC will become available in the coming months. For more on Cities: Skylines, read our 2015 review of the PC version here and the 2017 console version here. You can also read our 2021 interview with the CEO of Colossal Order on the enduring success of Cities: Skylines here.",

After just a few days with the game, I’m not ready to pass along a final verdict. But the roughly 18 hours I have played are helping to create a clear picture.\nIn that time, my most notable impression is that the developers have captured what is distinct and memorable about this fiction. Set many decades before the Harry Potter stories that unfolded in book and film, the game has a latitude to tell its own story with its own characters that is refreshing – even if there are a healthy smattering of familiar last names like Weasley and Black that are in the mix.

Those who haven’t been keeping up can sample the finished version by downloading a free demo today.\nDarkest Dungeon II arrives on PC on May 8. The game first entered early access in 2021 and, like the original, tasks players with taking a dozen heroes through dangerous dungeons. This time though, you’re guiding them on a treacherous caravan ride through five dangerous regions.\nHeroes can bond with or sour on each other via the Affinity System to create combat synergies or dysfunctions. Darkest Dungeon II also boasts a plethora of new upgrades and boons to bolster party members. The demo gives players access to the four starting heroes and two full regions to explore, but progress will not transfer to the full game. \nYou can play Darkest Dungeon II on Steam and the Epic Game Store.

Her other credits include Netflix's Jupiter's Legacy and contributions to the scores and soundtracks of movies like The Martian, Mulan (2020), and more, as reported by Variety.

That nomination went to Austin Wintory for his score in 2012's Journey. Wintory was nominated this year, this time for his Aliens: Fireteam Elite score, alongside Bear McCreary for Call of Duty: Vanguard, Christopher Tin for Old World, and Richard Jacques for Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy. \nEconomou's Grammy was awarded during the main show's pre-show segment, hosted by Randy Rainbow, who might have not been familiar with Assassin's Creed Valhalla, if the way he announced the game's name last night is any indication. \ncan’t stop laughing at this guy announcing the Grammy win for Assassin's Creed Valhalla pic.twitter.com/vz9bTVZFTX\nFebruary 5, 2023\nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Assassin's Creed Valhalla review and then read our impressions of its Dawn of Ragnarok expansion. \n[Source: Variety]\nWhat video game score should win at next year's Grammys show?

The teaser gave us a glimpse of Cat Mario's appearance in the film, as well as Donkey Kong's reaction. Today, Universal, Illumination, and Nintendo released the official movie poster for the Super Mario Bros. Movie.\nIn this new poster, we get a cinematic glimpse of the cast of main characters that we know of so far, including Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad, Bowser, Donkey Kong, and Kamek. Additionally, we see the opposing worlds in the apparent conflict of the film, with the darkness of Bowser's Castle contrasted by the bright and joyful Mushroom Kingdom. While nobody quite matches Donkey Kong and Toad's wide-eyed and unbridled bliss, every character on the poster is at least sporting a smirk.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie features an all-star cast, including Chris Pratt as Mario, Charlie Day as Luigi, Anya Taylor-Joy as Peach, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, Jack Black as Bowser, Seth Rogen as Donkey Kong, and Fred Armisen as Cranky Kong. We also know that Mario's video game voice actor, Charles Martinet, will have a cameo in the film at some point.\nTo this point, the movie has only received character-focused posters on top of a teaser poster that preceded the initial movie trailer. If you missed out on those posters, you can see every other character and teaser poster released for The Super Mario Bros. Movie below.\n\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie arrives in theaters on April 7.

Led by directors Yasuhiro Ampo and Kazunori Kadoi, who now sit at the helm of Resident Evil 4, the game revitalized the 1998 classic, introducded it to a new generation of fans, and paved the way for the RE3 and 4 remakes to come after.

          "description": "A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.6.1. It's time to prepare for a new release!\nOur lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:\nSoldier Boyz\nGLK Scott Adams Interactive Fiction games (C64 and ZX Spectrum)\nGLK Scott Adams adventures 1-12 (TI99/4A format)\nObsidian\nPink Panther: Passport to Peril\nPink Panther: Hokus Pokus Pink\nDriller/Space Station Oblivion\nHalls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II\nBesides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list. Maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long - otherwise, there are some demos of these games available on our website.\nAnd since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen notable changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.\nAs usual, we are not just adding support for new games. We are constantly working on improving the engines we already support and, in particular, we’ve seen some incredible work being done on the SCUMM engine. Yes, there are the usual bug fixes, but this time we are also adding a feature that helps playing the SCUMM games in a truly original fashion: Support for the original loading and saving dialogs within the GUI!\nSpeaking of truly original: Remember those old CRT displays we had back in the day? With ScummVM 2.7.0 you’ll be able to replicate this experience on certain platforms thanks to our new shader-based scalers. Go ahead and give it a try!\nAll testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.\nA detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.\nThank you very much for your support! Let’s make ScummVM 2.7.0 a great release - together!\n>",

          "description": "Breaking news: OpenTTD 13.0 is now available! Depending on your perspective, we’re either two months early for our usual April 1st release, or a bit tardy for the Christmas 2022 release we intended. We think the wait has been worth it. This is one of the largest releases we’ve done in several years, with numerous features and improvements covering the user interface, gameplay features, and modding extensions for NewGRF and Game Script creators. Some of the highlights are: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. This includes better automatic scaling when using HiDPI or mixed DPI setups. Direct access to NewGRF/AI/GS settings from the new game window. Various small tweaks and improvements to several windows. NewGRFs can now provide engine variants that are shown hierarchically in the purchase list. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. Custom league tables for GameScripts. More natural rivers which get wider as they flow downstream. And much more, which can be seen in the changelog or the previous release announcements! In addition to these features and improvements, we’ve fixed lots of bugs. (If you played with the RC2 testing release, most were fixed before then. See the changelog for full details.)
