Some of the stand-out changes are the in-game clock pausing when you use the storage shed or mailbox in single-player (shout out to the time management fans out there!), tweaks to the relationship mechanics and a fix that keeps your animals producing materials for you.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "A mushroom with some bite.\nIf you have ever thought even remotely deeply about the reality of the Super Mario universe (which we wouldn't recommend doing, seriously), then you might have bumped up against the most simple of questions: why does Mario get hurt when a Goomba hits him? As it turns out, this is something that Miyamoto was asked back in the days of the NES, and only with Super Mario Bros. Wonder, has Nintendo managed to visualise the reason.\nAccording to a new 'Ask the Developer' interview that Nintendo has published today, Miyamoto's answer back then was because the Goombas bite Mario on impact (at least, that's the way that Wonder's art director, Masanobu Sato remembers it), and so the Wonder developers decided to add an animation into the upcoming platformer to make this statement a reality.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

While it improves on some of the shortcomings of Front Mission 1st: Remake, the combat system isn’t fun enough to fully salvage this tactical RPG. While it might be worthwhile for strategy fans eager to test out G-Craft's 1997 PlayStation game that never got released outside of Japan, we can’t see Front Mission 2: Remake offering much to anyone else.\nIt’s a shame that the actual combat in Front Mission 2: Remake is so frustrating because the story is much improved over the previous entry. You control a group of soldiers who find themselves on the losing side of a coup and are trying to flee the nation of Alordesh. Warfare in this setting takes place almost exclusively in Wanzers, which are highly customisable mechs of varying levels of effectiveness depending on how you outfit them.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "\"We didn't hear anything about the film's content during development\".\nWe are just days away from the release of Super Mario Bros. Wonder on Switch and, as has become something of a tradition, Nintendo has today released the first two parts of an all-new 'Ask the Developer' interview series about the upcoming game.\nThe conversation covers a range of topics including how the team settled on the theme of 'wonder' and the changes that have been made to the game's visuals and sound design, but one section that immediately stood out to us was all about the influence that Illumination's The Super Mario Bros. Movie had on the game. You might assume that the film's forecasted success (remember, both were in development around the same time) would have weighed heavily on the developer's minds, potentially even influencing the bros. new game designs; but, as it turns out, this was not the case.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Well, with the title now available to pick up, it appears that the packed release date should have been the least of our worries.\nWe weren't expecting a lot from Kong's latest foray into the gaming world (2005's catchily-titled Peter Jackson's King Kong: The Official Game of the Movie on the GameCube is quite enough for us, thank you very much), but what we have seen today is unexpectedly hilarious. Several players who were unfortunate enough to pick up Skull Island have taken to Twitter to share some gameplay footage and the results are... something else.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

What’s more, if you’d have said that Sega’s latest entry, Sonic Superstars, would turn out to provide one of the strongest Sonic campaigns ever created, well quite frankly, we’d be pinching ourselves to double-check that we weren’t dreaming.\nYet here we are, folks. Sonic Superstars is here and it’s an absolute belter. It successfully blends the classic 2D gameplay formula from Sonic’s retro outings (with a big help from Sonic Mania’s physics system) with a modernised visual aesthetic, all the while introducing a handful of brand-new elements that, while not groundbreaking in their execution, are fun little extras that feel destined to evolve in future entries. For a while, it felt like Sonic Team was treading water with its side-on Sonic entries, but developer Arzest has delivered a game that gives Sega’s mascot a kick in the right 2D direction.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "The Amnesia games are set decades apart, but they all begin in the same moment, a moment of waking that is also a moment of erasure and disconnection, a rebirth outside the flow of events from which to descend into the machine of history afresh. On 19th August 1839, a young man opens his eyes to find himself in a vast, silent castle in the forests of Prussia. He discovers a letter from his \"past self\", Daniel, who urges him to murder the castle's secluded owner, a baron named Alexander, and warns that he is being hunted by a monstrous Shadow. 60 years later on New Year's Eve, the celebrated meat factory owner Oswald Mandus starts awake in the opulent stillness of his manor house in London. Hearing the distant voices of his children, he goes to look for them in the \"splendid architectures\" below.\nOn 21st July 1916, at the height of World War I, the soldier Henri Clément stumbles from his sickbed in a colossal bunker beneath the Western Front. With nobody about, and no memory of events during his convalescence, he follows a trail of blood through the collapsing tunnels towards the pantry. And on an unknown day in March 1939, the engineering drafter Tasi Trianon wakes in the wreckage of a plane, deep in the Algerian desert, and enters the nearby caves in search of her husband Salim. Four games, four forgotten pasts, four new beginnings, one descent.\nBeware: major spoilers for the entire Amnesia series below.\nRead more",

It's the next game from the Trese Brothers, the makers of Star Traders: Frontiers, and I've been playing its opening missions over the last couple of days. It's good, folks, and there's a lot to dig into with its release into early access this week. \nThere's a sizable story campaign and a bunch of side missions already playable here, and its emphasis on stealth and escalating security levels whisked me right back to the good old days of 2015 when I first sat down to play Klei's stealthy masterpiece. There are still a couple of rough edges here and there, but if you've been looking for a strategy RPG with a harder-edge than, say, Mimimi's recently released Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, or just something a bit sneakier than your run of XCOM-likes, Cyber Knights: Flashpoint is definitely worth keeping an augmented eye on.\nRead more",

          "description": "Back in the glorious Xbox One years, when every Microsoft executive was engaged in the act of putting one foot in their mouth while shooting it simultaneously, there was a giddy period of marketing conducted by means of Phil Spencer's T-shirts. He'd rock up on E3 stages like a cabaret dancer, touting tees with various new or elderly videogame licenses on them, and whipping older fans into a frenzy of speculation as to possible remakes or sequels. I myself had to go lie down after seeing Phil in a Phantom Dust shirt. Teaser-shirts, we should have called them. Look at him in the picture up there, showing off a chestful of Hexen. Shameless!\r\n\n\r\nSadly/happily, those halcyon days are behind us, but Phil still loves to dangle the carrot of an ancient IP now and then. Speaking on the Xbox podcast last night (while sporting a boring Halo championship jacket), he suggested that Microsoft could do more to revive their older franchises. Or at least \"revisit\" them in some fashion. \r\n\n \nRead more",

These CPUs offer the same access to DDR5 RAM and PCIe 5.0 components as Intel's latest offerings, yet typically consume less power while delivering better gaming performance at the high end. That makes it easier to build a balanced system, especially with deals on Ryzen 7000 CPUs and motherboards starting to become more commonplace. \nCase in point is this AWD-IT bundle deal on a Ryzen 5 7600X and an MSI MAG B650 Tomahawk WiFi motherboard for £400, versus £445 for the two items separately.

But the biggest surprise? How familiar it felt. So, it might be a bit odd that MW3 is wholly unsurprising for being more COD and simultaneously, a surprise for being more COD. Really, I think it comes down to developer Sledgehammer's decision to mash some of COD's previous triumphs with some of its finest maps.\nDespite COD extending its hand with a warm welcome back, I can't help but feel it's one trembled with nerves. MW3's beta suckered me in with its nostalgia hits but there's definitely an air of it being a stopgap as devs figure out where it should turn next.\nRead more",

Hermit And Pig is indeed a game about a reclusive old hermit and his truffle-hunting pig, but this charming adventure RPG also has one of the most involving turn-based battle systems I've come across in a while. \nTaking place in first person a la Dragon Quest, Hermit must deal with all sorts of mad and angry wildlife as he hunts for his favourite forest mushrooms, and their scowling (and endearingly daft) expressions are just the tip of this excellent iceberg. For you're not just choosing from a list of moves and watching them play out onscreen. Oh no. Each attack also comes with its own three-button fighting combo, and you'll need to input the right one (often at the right time) to deal the most damage. It's a brilliant system, making Hermit And Pig easily one of this year's highlights from EGX's Leftfield Collection. \nRead more",

          "description": "If you played a videogame at all in 2022, I hope it was Roadwarden. A blend of RPG and visual novel from Polish developer Moral Anxiety, it cast you as lonesome wayfarer maintaining the paths and investigating the mysteries or grievances of a thinly populated wilderness setting. It's a game of immense feeling, craft and cleverness, inspired by table-top games, which puts hoarier ideas about videogame role-playing through the wringer. In the world of Roadwarden, there's no grinding for XP or mindless loot-crafting treadmill. Knowledge, empathy and insight are worth far more than material wealth or wielding the shiniest axe. Quests can hinge on something as minute as your ear for dialects or knowing the correct form of address. And each village along the trail is a world in itself.\r\n\n\r\nMoral Anxiety's Windy Meadow - which actually dates back to before development of Roadwarden, but has been substantially remastered since the latter's release - essentially narrows the focus to one of those villages. Out today, it's a quietly gorgeous visual novel in which you follow several characters in different timeframes, building up a layered understanding of one and the same setting, with scene transitions plotted on a beautiful pixelart map screen.\n Read more",

          "description": "Newly released documents have given us a rare inside look at how gun manufacturers have tried to use videogames to promote their wares to younger people - specifically, players of Activision's original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, released in 2009. The memos and emails in question are from now-defunct US gun company Remington Arms, which was once part of the conglomerate Freedom Group. They've been disclosed by a lawyer as part of legal proceedings launched by the parents of children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, in which 20-year-old Adam Lanza shot and killed 26 people using a Remington-made AR15 rifle.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Made by the same team behind 2018's Project Hospital, Silence Of The Siren is an homage to Heroes Of Might And Magic where several different alien races are fighting to control a distant alien planet. It's a little bit 4X-y, but not massively so, and I had a very fun time indeed with its EGX demo over the weekend, which I think I played for almost a solid hour and completely forgot about the growing queue of folks behind me.

There are vacuum tubes mounted on one wall, doors to either side, and a ladder leading further down into darkness.\nYou click one of the doors and the perspective switches over slide-projector style to a second room with identical proportions. There are pipes emerging from the floor, here, and some kind of antique radio on a pedastel in the centre. Hang on, I know this place. I know this formless sense of dread. I know these machinations. The last time I set foot here, it was 2009 and I was running a Flash game blog, writing up choice submissions to sites like Kongregate.

          "description": "Minecraft update 1.21 has been revealed, and well, looks like Mojang have been reading my posts demanding the addition of a proper maze generator, those sneaky devils. As explained by Minecraft game director Agnes Larsson, the forthcoming Minecraft update – which has yet to be given a release date – is designed to “focus more on combat adventures and on tinkering” than last year's Cave & Cliffs update.\nThe headline addition is an underground structure called the Trial Chamber, a procedurally generated cluster of traps and treasure rooms, fashioned from copper and tuff blocks and arranged around a central hallway. From the Minecraft Live footage this weekend, Trial Chambers look like an evolution of the game's old buried fortresses, with some nifty new flourishes in the shape of copper bulb blocks that slowly give off less and less light, and new Trial Spawners, which generate a certain number of hostile mobs based on things like the number of players in your party.\r\n\n \nRead more",

But having played a timed 20-minute demo of it at this year's EGX, I'll hold my hands up and say, yep, I'm the one who's been slapped in the face with a giant custard pie here, as Loco Motive is genuinely really quite good, folks, and I'm pleased to report the good old days are still very much alive and kicking.

Whether it's in my own, real-life home or in a game, I am compelled to scrub, wipe and tidy - and the oily, purple globs of gunk clogging up Loddlenaut's appropriately named region of Flotsam Flats are just begging to be zapped by my little diver's handy laser gun. With just a single squeeze of the trigger, he sets to work, moving his arm automatically to neatly attack each neighbouring blob without any further prompting or manual aiming. All I need to focus on is getting him close enough to the gunge and he'll take care of the rest. Sure, it's perhaps not quite as involved as your PowerWash Sims and other polish em ups, but the combination of Loddlenaut's lo-fi visuals, comforting score and surprisingly soothing controller rumble all work to give it its own kind of zen-like charm - and it was enough to make me forget the surrounding din of the EGX Rezzed Zone for a very enjoyable 20 minutes or so.\nRead more",

You drive a selection of vehicles across an increasingly ludicrous desert while everything in the universe tries to stop you. But you have guns. Or flamethrowers.

As the bare buttocks of returning Yakuza: Like A Dragon hero Ichiban Kasuga indicated in the reveal trailer for Infinite Wealth, we’re not in Yokohama anymore, but Honolulu, Hawaii. He’s not alone on his journey either. As well as his mates from the first LAD, plus lots more newcomers, mainline Yakuza stablemate Kazuma Kiryu, now extra frosty with his silver hairdo, is also coming along for the ride as well. \nAlas, the circumstances in which the two join forces wasn’t covered in my 30-minute demo at this year’s EGX. Rather, we pick up Ichiban, Kiryu and fresh faces Chitose and Tomizawa as they land in Honolulu, in search of a dodgy cop named Roman who's managed to wrong almost everyone in the group at some point in the past. 30 minutes isn’t long in a game like Yakuza, but hey, I still got to screech at restaurant goers in one of its sidequest stories, as well as terrorise the general public on Ichiban’s always-deployable segway, which I’d still call a pretty strong introduction to this latest LAD.\nRead more",

This spooky lantern might open up some cool realm-hopping twists on your grim adventure, and the game as a whole might instil a sense of exploration sure to please souls fans after a familiar hit of uncertain peril, but its finer details chip away at your patience.

          "description": "Whereas most games begin by getting you into the action as quickly as possible, Saltsea Chronicles opens with a quick note about its save system. It's a small, but important detail in this story-driven adventure game, as throughout its nine-to-ten-hour run time, you'll be faced with various decisions about where your crew of post-apocalyptic drifters will explore next, as they set sail in search of their missing captain Maja. By choosing one island at the end of every chapter, you'll naturally miss out on visiting another - and with 14 locales to explore in total in the Saltsea archipelago (and only 12 chapters to do it in), each playthrough has the potential to end up being quite different from the last.\nBut up front it tells you \"There are no wrong choices, only your choices\" in Saltsea Chronicles, and that ultimately this is a tale about \"tracing different pathways\" using its clever branching save system. While you can, of course, play it through from start to finish in a single swoop, you also have the option to purloin its additional save slots to take those roads less travelled (presented here as delightful, wiggling seaweed tendrils), and all without overwriting your existing adventure. Immediately, that sense of FOMO is dispelled, and instead of worrying about 'seeing everything' or making sure you get a 'good' playthrough, you can simply enjoy its enthralling tale of high seas soap opera, curious exploration, and the knotty drama that comes with trying to forge connections in an increasingly fragmented world. It's a journey well worth taking, even if what lies at the end of it didn't quite come together in the way I'd hoped.\nRead more",

In this deceptively Civilization-esque 4X strategy game, all player turns unfold simultaneously, once you've decided what to build or research, where to move your units, and so on. As Oxide Games design director Michelle Menard tells me over Zoom, this approach takes inspiration from an ancient military simulator, Kriegsspiel, which was devised by the Prussian army officer George Leopold von Reisswitz, aka the \"father of wargaming\", in the mid-1800s. \r\n\n\r\n\"It was to train their generals, it was a legit apparatus of war, it was not for funsies,\" says Menard. \"And they basically created this massive table that had a modular terrain system. At first they used sand, but that was kind of messy, [and so] they developed a system where they had interchangeable tiles, like hills and valleys and plateaus. \r\n\n\r\n\"They would build out this table, literally drop a sheet down the middle, and it'd be like, OK, you guys on each side, you can't see what the other person's doing. There was an actual game master, who was the referee who you would report your moves to. He would then re-set up the board and basically call people back into the room and be like, tada! It's the next turn - let's see what people did. Was it what you expected?\" \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Sometimes, when I’m winning a Total War battle handily, I like to pick an absolutely haggard group of low-tier hopelesses and spend the rest of the fight zoomed in on them, narrativising their high-stakes struggles in a rich and velvety internal monologue that monopolises my attention so fully that I more or less ignore the rest of the battle. That these are among my absolute favourite Total War moments may say something about the level of satisfaction to be found elsewhere in the series’ strategy sandboxes, at times as robust as ancient oaks, others as stale as ancient wotsits. It may be an admission on both our parts that, for all its simulated complexity, Total War is really for people who’d be just as happy playing with those little elasticated catapults and plastic castles, if we could still sit on the floor without our pelvises crumbling into soup mix.  \r\n\n\nTotal War: Pharaoh, which I will acknowledge once and once only as being officially stylised PHARAOH, is almost certainly the most systemically interesting and quality-of-life-full a Total War game has been at launch for a very long time. Three Kingdoms has better diplomacy, Warhammer has unequivocally better goblins, but none are as refreshingly cavalier and passionately thorough with the blueprint of what Total War has the potential to be. CA Sofia should be immensely proud of what they’ve done here, but the realities of Total War’s ridiculous release schedule now clearly mean that even a studio as willing and able to innovate so much in such a short time frame are effectively prevented from producing a genuinely exciting strategy game. I’d love to tell you these new plastic castles are more fun than your old ones, but there’s not even any catapults.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The Meta Quest 2 was the ideal gaming VR package: powerful and accessible enough to provide easy, convincing immersion, while also staying highly affordable. Nonetheless, Meta’s sudden fixation on creating a legless version of Second Life did have me worried about the future trajectory of its VR hardware. What daft gimmickry would their next headset come festooned with, and what would it mean for the future of the Quest as a gaming device?\r\n\n\r\nWith the Meta Quest 3, we have the answer. And the truth is, Meta’s latest headset does have a whiff of Metaverse about it. Dubbed a \"mixed reality\" device, its raison d’être is to break down the barrier between reality and the virtual world. While mixed reality is an angle I’m not wholly sold on from a gaming perspective, crucially, the features that make it a mixed reality device are useful even if you don’t want to hold a meeting in your office with a bunch of bisected Sims. Moreover, they’re built into a headset that is more powerful, more comfortable, and generally better than the Meta Quest 2.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Much like a Call of Duty player inching up the stairs behind a wily sniper, Microsoft are closing in on final, final approval of their multi-billion purchase of Activision Blizzard, having more-or-less won over the UK's competition and markets authority. The company expect to bring it home by 13th October.\nAside from hastening the arrival of a grim future that consists of a giant, mechanised Phil Spencer engaged in a trans-Pacific staring contest with Nintendo, this also means we can expect new and recent behemoths like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Diablo 4 on Microsoft's Game Pass subscription service. But not for a while, it seems.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "In the nicest possible way, and with the greatest of respect, Remedy's comms director Thomas Puha would like people to stop fixating on frame-rate and resolution and get on with their bloody lives. Or at least, that's my summary of his thoughts following the recent announcement on Xitter that Alan Wake 2 will have a performance mode on PS5 and Xbox Series X, allowing consoleers for whom responsiveness is a priority to eke a higher frame-rate out of a game \"built from the beginning as a 30fps experience focusing on visuals and ambiance.\"\nPuha has subsequently been chatting to press about the creation of the mode and Alan Wake 2's visuals at large. In what has become a time-honoured ceremony for any AAA game developer a month or two before release, he took a moment to observe that focussing on frame-rate vs resolution is missing the wood for the trees. (The trees in question do take a toll on Alan Wake 2's performance, but we'll get to that further down the page.)\r\n\n \nRead more",

As everyone celebrates another impressive achievement from Insomniac, journalist Jason Schreier revealed that the studio allows employees to work from wherever they want. \n\n\n\n\nSome commenters did point out that there are some restrictions regarding which US states and Canadian provinces this is allowed in, though it appears possible in most of North America. \n\n\nImage via Insomniac Games.\n\n\nRoblox Corp…",

          "description": "Igor Aleksandrowicz has fully released their retro-inspired FPS, Calcium Contract, on Steam. It will run you $15.99.\n\n\nI first tried out Calcium Contract back in July and came away impressed by its unique and unusual take on the subgenre. Back then, I said, “It feels like if Duke Nukem 3D was designed by a studio localized within McDonaldsland.\" I kind of stand by that. It’s a bizarre and colorful experience about a Grim Reaper who has to bring down a chicken serpent that simply refuses to die.\n\n\n\n\nUnlike most other games in the genre, Calcium Contract isn’t about big guns and bigger explosions. Its arsenal consists of a number of strange contraptions that shoot things like musical golden bones. Likewise, the enemies are a vast mixture of chickens, cats, and lizards. Aleksandrowicz says their focus was on “game feel” and that really shows. There are lots of small touches that are used to heighten your connection with the world, and cleverly removing wall-humping secrets means that the pacing is never bogged down.\n\n\nIf anything, Calcium Contract’s biggest issue is that it doesn’t have a lot of the biggest selling points that people look for with these sorts of games (i.e. big guns and bigger explosions). That’s too bad since it’s every bit as intense as one with more conventional munitions. My hope is that it will still develop a large following in spite of this.\n\n\nUnfortunately, I don’t think I’ll have time to do a formal review of this one. However, my preview earlier in the year covered a pretty sizeable chunk of the game (more than what was included in the demo), so the preview I did will still hold true today.\n\n\nCalcium Contract is available right now for PC.\n\nThe post Calcium Contract is out now to fulfill all your weird FPS desires appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Last time I was face to face with an aerial Moby Dick, it was in Death Stranding. Well, it's back to the skyward trenches, apparently, because massive mammals are on the menu in Project: Mist. Developer Chicken Launcher and publisher Awaken Realms revealed the title as an open-world survival horror game that gives off serious The Forest vibes. \n\n\nThanks to Gematsu, we know a little more about the colossal terrors of Project Mist. While there's no release date, Project: Mist is in the works for PC and, as promised, features flying whales front and center. If that's not too harrowing for you this Halloween season, you can see them along with other sizable threats in the announcement trailer.\n\n\n\n\nProject: Mist promises \"full freedom\" with \"no forced quest[s], no hand holding, no telling you what to do.\" You're basically plopped smack dab in the middle of a harsh world with survival as the main goal. As you no doubt noticed in the trailer, flying whales aren't the only thing you'll have to worry about. There are big ugly heads, nasty mouth things, and even bigger and slimier dudes? Those aren't the canonical Project: Mist names, but they'll do for now. \n\n\nThankfully, it sounds like you'll have plenty of countermeasures at your disposal. In addition to building a base and defending it from threats, you can create traps, weapons, and other essential items. There are axes, crossbows, guns, and apparently a \"game-changing\" Gravity Gun. It's not clear exactly how that one works yet, but maybe we'll learn more soon.\n\n\nChicken Launcher not included\n\n\nThe developer behind Project: Mist previously worked on games like 2022's No Place Like Home. The cute, relaxing sim garnered some positive reviews, and seems as thematically distant from Chicken Launcher's latest as possible. A Steam page is live now, so we'll just have to wait to learn the secrets of the giant wall. \n\nThe post Project: Mist looks like The Forest with flying whales and giant heads appeared first on Destructoid.",

The shoes are not yet empty, but Onion Soup Interactive is looking to fill them anyway with Super 56. That’s bold, but while they’re doing some heavy lifting to the formula, they’re bringing along their own drinks to the party. To be fair, it isn’t even WarioWare’s party. Puzzle & Action: Tant-R has been dancing since ‘93, but even I’m not certain they were the first to arrive.\n\n\nSuper 56 is a microgame rush. To draw further comparison to WarioWare it leans heavily into nostalgia for older games. It also digs into absurd humor until it hits paydirt.

          "description": "Spotted by Twitter user Timur222 and reported by Game World Observer it appears that the latest to be affected by layoffs within Embracer Group and the video game industry in general are Cryptic Studios and Zen Studios.\n\n\nThe news has come as a result of multiple employees within the studios updating their Linkedin profiles to seek new employment opportunities. Because of this, it’s unknown just how many are affected by these layoffs, which appear to have happened last week, and Embracer has not released a statement to clarify.\n\n\n\n\nCryptic Studios rose to prominence with the development of City of Heroes (my favorite MMO) and continues to maintain Champions Online, Star Trek Online, and Neverwinter. Meanwhile, Zen Studios is the developer behind the Zen Pinball and Pinball FX series.\n\n\nThe layoffs are part of a continued cost-cutting campaign by Embracer Group. The company had previously launched an aggressive acquisition campaign and bought out a number of developers, large and small. This seems to be related to a $2 Billion dollar investment that reportedly fell through earlier in the year.\n\n\nEmbracer isn’t the only one conducting layoffs. This year has been horrible when it comes to people losing their jobs, not just in the video game industry but the tech industry in general. The list is a bit long, and it’s really depressing, so I’m just going to copy what Destructoid’s own Eric “Boulder Puncher” Van Allen wrote previously:\n\n\n\"A brief list includes Epic Games, Striking Distance Studios, CD Projekt Red, multiple studios owned by Embracer Group including Beamdog and Crystal Dynamics, Ubisoft, BioWare, Relic, Riot, Firaxis, and Microsoft. Plus reports of more at Twitch, Naughty Dog, and Team17. On top of all that, there was also the shutdown of Dang!, PixelOpus, Vanpool, and Volition Games.\"\n\nThe post Cryptic Studios and Zen Studios appear to be the latest affected by Embracer Group’s layoffs appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Mark “Markiplier” Fischbach has posted a short teaser for his upcoming film adaptation of Iron Lung, a 2022 horror game from David Szymanski. According to Fischbach, who is directing, writing, and starring in the adaptation, it's  “coming soon to theaters”. A nice surprise for fans used to his work launching as YouTube exclusives. \n\n\nIn the teaser, which features music by Andrew Hulshult and narration by JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure voice actor Mick Lauer, we see what is presumably the main character emerging from a sea of blood and ominous lightning. \n\n\n\n\nFans of Fischbach (and, by extension, listeners of his podcast Distractible) will note that he recently went to the hospital on his birthday because he went “too deep in the blood.” The stunt resulted in his eyes turning a worrying shade of red. It was clear at the time that it was related to the production of Iron Lung, but now the teaser makes it clear it's most likely the cause of that incident.\n\n\nIron Lung is “a short horror game where you pilot a tiny submarine through an ocean of blood on an alien moon,” according to developer and publisher David Szymanski, known for works like DUSK, Chop Goblins, and Squirrel Stapler. Fischbach announced a film adaptation in April, and fans have received periodic behind-the-scenes updates both via YouTube and Distractible.\n\n\nDestructoid’s Zoey Handley had this to say about Iron Lung: “It’s a brilliant approach to the horror genre. It keeps you feeling perpetually vulnerable. There is nothing to help you and absolutely no escape. Your only option is to keep pressing ahead, as there’s no rescue until the job is done. Don’t get distracted, ignore the sounds. Hurry, but be careful not to bash into a wall. I don’t think it’s possible to represent that idea better in an interactive medium. Iron Lung really is the perfect short-form horror experience.”\n\nThe post Markiplier posts teaser for Iron Lung film, is coming to theaters “soon” appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Systemic Reaction has announced that they have canceled further development on their multiplayer dinosaur FPS, Second Extinction, and has removed it from sale on marketplaces. Servers are set to close down for it in 2024.\n\n\nSecond Extinction entered Early Access in October 2020, and never really left. The initial goal was to fully launch late last year, but that got delayed due to “critical issues.” After assessing things, the team has decided just to drop it and move on.\n\n\n“Unfortunately, it became clear that our small team lacked the resources necessary to hit our quality targets and exit Early Access and Game Preview, and the investment needed to do so was too large for us to bear. After evaluating our options and working during this year to find other potential solutions, this became the reality our team had to face.”\n\n\nInterestingly, Systemic Reaction is part of Avalanche Studios Group, which, in turn, is a subsidiary of Nordisk Film. If we take them by their word, then that must be one hell of a corner they painted themselves into.\n\n\nEvery cloud, I guess\n\n\nWhile the cancellation of a game that people have already paid for is pretty crappy, there is one silver lining here:\n\n\n“Although this isn’t the outcome any of us hoped for, we want to assure you that there are no layoffs associated with this decision.”\n\n\nIdeally, studios should be able to make mistakes and be able to turn around from it. It’s just not a great look when the expense is all on their supporters. The developer doesn’t really have the best track record to begin with, having made Generation Zero and Ravenbound, neither of which got the best reception. Perhaps that’s part of the decision to can Second Extinction.\n\n\nNonetheless, there’s always a chance for a developer to turn things around, and here’s hoping that Systemic Reaction can do just that and gain back the trust of the supporters who might feel burned by this cancellation.\n\nThe post Second Extinction ends further development, gets delisted appeared first on Destructoid.",

Now, the developer has issued yet another apology, saying that the anticipated update needs \"additional time.\"\n\n\nOver on Twitter, the official Payday 3 account apologized to fans for the \"lack of communication regarding the first patch.\". Starbreeze Studios says it's found more issues to rectify before the patch launches. \n\n\n\n\nAn additional post underneath notes due to the additional time needed to tend to the game, the studio can't provide an ETA on when fixes will launch just yet. A third tweet adds a suffix to this apology, saying that both the patch and some more news are inbound. We just don't know when.\n\n\nMaybe it'll be worth it in the end\n\n\nWhile the studio did do some maintenance to make Payday 3's matchmaking better, one of the major criticisms with the game is the always-online feature.

On the one hand, the streaming platform is experiencing peak viewership, but on the other, the company is reportedly laying staff off. Still, it's business as usual, and it looks as though the Amazon-owned company now wants a slice of that social media pie.\n\n\nIn a recent blog post, Twitch announced the introduction of stories to its app. Those who regularly use Facebook or Instagram will already be familiar with this feature. Essentially, Twitch has \"made it easier for you to reach your community directly on Twitch, through short posts that expire in 48 hours.\"\n\n\n\n\nThis appears to be a work-in-progress and will have \"more features in the coming months\". And given Twitch's reputation for being a hotbed of hatred and general toxic behavior, safety measures are factored into stories \"in a way that fosters a safe space for you and your community.\"\n\n\nNot available for everyone yet, though\n\n\nHowever, the post does make it clear that this feature is not rolling out to all users just yet. For now, they're \"currently limited to Partners & Affiliates who have had at least one stream in the last 30 days.\"\n\n\nThere are plans to make it available to eligible users by the end of the week. However, streamers will need to \"meet the minimum eligibility requirements.\" There's always a catch with these things.\n\n\nWhatever you think about the new feature, it seems Twitch is looking to keep its head above water by rolling out additional bells and whistles.

          "description": "Just in time for the holidays, Whitethorn Games and Gameous have announced that Lake: Season's Greetings will launch on November 15, 2023.\n\n\nSeason’s Greetings is a prequel chapter of the small-town slice-of-life game Lake. Set before the events of the base game, you’re dropped in Providence Oaks as protagonist Meredith’s father, Thomas Weiss. He was previously an offscreen character in Lake, but now will get to color in the backstory with his own point of view. It’s 1985 in a small town, and that’s sort of relaxing. Let’s rent some horror and shove it into the VHS player.\n\n\n\n\nNot only that, but, as the title implies, the town is completely cloaked in snow. Thomas is delivering packages during the height of the holidays, which probably means Christmas music. I can’t say I’m down for that because I have a lot of trauma from working in retail for a couple of holidays. It might be even worse than that pop country in the base Lake.\n\n\nI felt pretty lukewarm about Lake back when I reviewed it. This was mostly because I felt that the narrative really thought you should love small towns and look down on the busy lives of urban dwellers. I grew up in a rural area, and while it has its comforts, it’s not all fresh apple pie and how-do-you-dos.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I love a good holiday game and am often interested to see if a developer takes feedback into account when revisiting a concept. November might be a busy month, but maybe I’ll be able to fit in another visit to Providence Oaks.\n\n\nLake: Season's Greetings launches on November 15, 2023 on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.\n\nThe post Lake’s Season’s Greetings DLC will be home for the holidays on November 15 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you thought we were done talking about Starfield mods, think again. One of the great things about PC gaming (typically) is the ability to tinker with vanilla releases. In this case, one person has taken Bethesda's sci-fi RPG and injected a dose of Doctor Who.\n\n\nOver on Nexus Mods, user xShadowBlitzz has brought the iconic Daleks to Starfield, replacing the sanitation mini bots that scuttle about the place.\n\n\nImage via xShadowBlitzz/Nexus Mods.\n\n\nFrom the description, this mod is currently a work-in-progress, featuring three textured Daleks so far. It also looks as though they don't have their sound effects yet, but they could be coming in a future update.\n\n\nAre we bored with Starfield yet?\n\n\nThere's no denying that there's a lot to see in the game, but the newest IP from the Skyrim studio already feels like it's dropped off the radar a tad. Its hype was all too real, with the game becoming one of the most successful launches of this console generation.\n\n\nIt's too early to say at this stage, but some may be wondering whether it will outlast the likes of TES5. The 2011 fantasy RPG has somehow kept itself in the limelight (probably helped by all those re-releases). Some of this longevity can be attested to the modding community.\n\n\nWhether Starfield will be able to boast such a legacy more than ten years from now cannot be said. However, if Bethesda keeps on top of things with new content and bug fixes (look it up, Todd), it could stand the test of time. Also, mods. More mods will probably help.\n\nThe post Starfield meets Doctor Who in this Dalek mod appeared first on Destructoid.",

The proceeds of this month's bundle go to support International Medical Corps and Direct Relief. If you pay at least $13, you can add STASIS: Bone Totem, Bendy and the Ink Machine, Bendy and the Dark Revival, Alan Wake Collector’s Edition, Hidden Deep, Tormented Souls, Pathologic 2, and Moons of Madness to your library on Steam.\n\n\nPlus, it's the Alan Wake Collector’s Edition. This version includes not only the base game but also a pair of special episodes called “The Signal” and “The Writer.\" There's also developer commentary, an illustrated PDF book, and a soundtrack with nearly an hour of fully mastered audio tracks composed by Petri Alanko, Old Gods of Asgard, and Poets of the Fall. \n\n\nIt’s just in time for the sequel, Alan Wake 2, on October 27 for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC via the Epic Games Store. The game's director, Sam Lake, also recently confirmed his plans for free DLC at this year's EGX. That is to say, catch up now before your Alan Wake to-do list grows too long. \n\n\nIn addition to experiencing (for the first time, no less) the Pacific Northwest adventures of Alan Wake, being able to add both games in the Bendy and the Ink Machine duology to my library makes this bundle one I don’t want to pass up.

Naruto and Naruto Shippuden have been home to some of the most iconic opening themes, and they're on the way to the next game. Bandai Namco announced new DLC for Naruto x Boruto Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections adding five fan-favorite songs along with some in-game items. \n\n\nHere's a sample, so go ahead and start belting out your best anime theme song karaoke. \n\n\n\n\nThe new in-game items include the Ninja Info Card Skin and two substitution items: Microphone and Orange Headphones. The five featured themes include:\n\n\n\n“GO!!!” by FLOW\n\n\n“Haruka Kanata” by ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION\n\n\n“Blue Bird” by Ikimonogakari\n\n\n“Silhouette” by KANA-BOON\n\n\n“Kaze” by Yamazaru\n\n\n\nReliving Naruto history\n\n\nAll of the songs are essentials from the Naruto series, with FLOW's \"GO!!!\" providing the fourth opening theme song for the original. ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION's \"Haruka Kanata\" was the second for Naruto, and Ikimonogakari's \"Blue Bird\" was the third for Naruto Shippuden. KANA-BOON's \"Silhouette\" served as Naruto Shippuden's 16th OP, and Yamazaru's \"Kaze\" directly followed that act. The series has a ton of themes, and this lineup runs the gamut with some heavy hitters.\n\n\nThe appropriately named The Nostalgic Anime Song & Item DLC will be available for all platforms. It's also coming to the limited time Sound Ultimate Bundle, which is a Steam exclusive set that includes the game, season pass, and more.

Turn 10 is aware and working on some of those issues, but Forza's community is also hard at work improving how the game looks. \n\n\nAccording to Gabriel Corrêa's Reddit post, they may have discovered a way to improve Forza Motorsport's shipped ray tracing capabilities by a fair margin. After snooping through files, Corrêa explained how they pieced together that Motorsport's configuration still used low-definition textures even when set to Ultra. Corrêa also shows they fixed the rendition of wheels at extreme speeds, along with other issues discovered combing configuration files. \n\n\n\"I compared the files in FM with those in FH5 and found these problems,\" wrote Corrêa. \"512x5…",

          "description": "If the debut trailer is anything to go by, chaos is on the menu for Starnaut. Developer Crim announced the spacey adventure for PC, with Early Access to kick off in February 2024. The roguelike action game has you playing as an astronaut on a solo space expedition that lands them in the multiverse. From there you'll be blasting \"endless incoming enemies\" that can be deceptively cute and drop what seems to be an equally endless number of coins. \n\n\nCheck out a sample of the running, blasting, and frequently exploding gameplay in the debut trailer.\n\n\n\n\nBlaster master\n\n\nThe straightforward story sets up a world in which people launched Omega Rockets containing their memories and history before doomsday struck. The rockets ended up landing in the multiverse, though, so it's up to Starnaut to find out if humanity can come back from the brink if all the rockets are returned. More importantly, doing so gives Starnaut an excuse to run around, fire off countless volleys, and collect coins for weapon and suit upgrades.\n\n\nIt all looks like utter madness. There are massive tentacles, floating panda bears, and a bunch of rockets ready to launch. Get all the Omega Rockets flying and launch along with the last one and you'll take home the win, it seems. \"Those enemies are not only hungry for you but YOUR KNUCKLE SANDWICH!!!,\" the description reads. That's a powerful bullet point, right there. \n\n\nIf the name Crim sounds familiar, that's because it's Sawaki Takeyasu's company. The director behind 2011's El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron previously bought that game's rights in 2013, and an HD remaster launched in 2021. Takeyasu is now enthusiastically tweeting about Starnaut, so we'll have to see how it shapes up as we get closer to Early Access. \n\nThe post Starnaut trailer reveals roguelike full of explosions, coins, and endless enemies appeared first on Destructoid.",

That is to say, a crap game. Even though I am the foremost and sole member at the institute, it can be quite a challenge, as was the case with the Carmageddon series.\n\n\nCarmageddon has a lot of the facets of kusoge. Each game invariably controls like garbage. Its vehicle physics is detestable. And the mechanics are very loosely tied together and wobbly. However, as I was doing the legwork to establish the series as kusoge, I realized that, while they are concept-first games, they are fun to play under their own merits.\n\n\nHowever, there are (at least) two exceptions in the series.

Those interested in some spooky goodness don't have to wait long because the new title is out...well...now. Players can download the free Action Adventure title for free on Steam.\n\n\n\n\nVR Only\n\n\nIt appears VR is required to experience Return to Northbury Grove, as the notice on the Steam page indicates a VR headset is required. For now, it looks like OpenXR, Oculus XR, SteamVr, and WMR are the supported platforms.\n\n\nIn Return to Northburgy Grove, players take on the role of Liam Murphy, an aspiring actor determined to land the role of a lifetime at the infamous Rock the Warehouse music festival. When he gets there though, the concert grounds are desolate and Liam gets kidnapped and thrown into the basement of the Spector Forest Slasher's kill-house.\n\n\nIn classic Scythe Dev Team fashion, the visuals and audio are chilling, to say the least. According to the Steam Page, choices matter and can impact your survival in real time. Adaptive AI makes no two playthroughs the same.\n\n\nI'm not quite on the VR train just yet, but this is certainly the kind of game meant for VR. It's like a slasher horror movie except in VR. After playing HHBF I know that Scythe knows how to nail a creepy atmosphere, so I'm sure it's a journey.\n\n\nReturn to Northbury Grove is available now for free on Steam.\n\nThe post Happy’s Humble Burger Farm devs release free VR title Return to Northbury Grove appeared first on Destructoid.",

The new 24-man raid apparently has a little easter egg for players familiar with the MMO's fishing lore, and it involves shooting your shot with one of the realm's 12 gods, Llymlaen.\n\n\nIn the Thaleia Raid, if you catch her at just the right time, using the '/blowkiss' emote on Llymlaen causes her to stop and scold you. \"Oi, cut it out, you!\" she chides, before hitting you with True Damage and taking you down to one HP. \n\n\n\n\nThe Japanese FFXIV fan site Umadori first chronicled player encounters with Llymlaen last week. The attack she uses is Navigator's Dagger, a fish found in La Noscea, where, you guessed it, Llymlaen is the patron god. The in-game description notes these long, blade-like fish are the \"knives thrown by Llymlaen at Her enemies.\" The bigger version of that fish, Navigator's Brand, adds, \"Fishers believe that this wavekin was the blade that Llymlaen threw at Oschon in Her fury at having Her naked form espied.\"\n\n\nAnyway, in the name of science, I tested the FFXIV easter egg myself. I'm happy to report Llymlaen kicked my ass. Sorry for the uh, messy screenshot. I was a little too antsy about getting the watcher of the seas to stab me to death, so quality wasn't top of mind.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nI couldn't tell you the exact moment I caught her, but I did spam the 'blowkiss' emote with the chatlog option turned off — didn't want to spam the chat. But at some point, I did get her to turn to me, stun my poor Warrior of Light, and take her down to one HP. I was stunned for so long I died, but worth it. I got the kiss and the clear, and now I'm off to try this on Halone.\n\nThe post Final Fantasy XIV raid boss has a secret attack for anyone who tries to kiss her appeared first on Destructoid.",

Due out October 20 exclusively on PlayStation 5, developer Insomniac Games' sequel to 2018's Marvel's Spider-Man and 2020's Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a game we thoroughly enjoyed – read Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 review here – and we're excited for others to play it. Insomniac is too, but in a new statement, it tells players that while the game will be playable on physical discs in full, it recommends downloading the day one patch. \nMore specifically, the download update is Version 1.001.002 and it will be available at launch this Friday. Digital owners don't need to worry about this as the patch will be installed as part of the pre-loaded version of Marvel's Spider-Man 2. \nKeep up with the latest updates for Marvel's #SpiderMan2PS5! #BeGreaterTogether pic.twitter.com/Z8ZDjscyB4\nOctober 17, 2023\n\"The disc contains the entire game and is playable from start to finish with no patch or online requirement,\" Insomniac's statement reads. \"But for the best experience, we highly encourage physical/disc-based players to download update Version 1.001.002 on launch day – prior to experiencing the opening mission of the game for the first time. Digital players – don't worry, if you pre-load the digital version of the game, you'll get 1.001.002 as your pre-loaded version.\" \nAs for why, Insomniac says this update features polish to the gold master of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 available on disc. It improves the opening sections of the game and includes other general refinements to the Spidey experience. It also includes some additional accessibility options. \nMarvel's Spider-Man 2 hits PlayStation 5 on October 20. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 review and then watch this Marvel's Spider-Man 2 cinematic trailer.

Now, Analogue is targeting the Nintendo 64 catalog with its next device, the Analogue 3D. \nAnalogue has shared an image of what appears to be the device, although the full look at it is obscured. You can view it at the top of the article, but it's below as well:\nAn image released alongside today's news teases what appears to be a sleek, black, and faithful recreation of the Nintendo 64 controller. You can check it out below: \nAnalogue says the 3D device will feature 4K HDMI output, its proprietary Analogue OS, wireless Bluetooth, and 2.4G Wi-Fi. It will also have \"4 original-style controller ports,\" presumably so that players can use their original Nintendo 64 controllers with the 3D. The company says the 3D's 4K output allowed \"us to created incomprehensibly profound Original Display Modes,\" and that in collaboration with 8BitDo, it will release a wireless controller for the device. \nAnalogue didn't share more, but the 3D is set to release some time in 2024. Preorders are not yet open, but if it's like the Pocket release, preorders will happen well before the actual release (and if you want one, plan on preordering because the Pockets sold out immediately). \n\nWhile waiting to learn more, read Game Informer's Analogue Pocket review. \nAre you excited about the Analogue 3D?

Join us as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign.  \nAfter 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.\nJoin editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up. \nPart 1 - Surpr-iced! \nPart 2 - Bringing The Smoke\nPart 3 - Staff Meeting\nPart 4 - My Life As A Lin Kuei Robot\nFinale - Waking the Dragons\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

Unfortunately, co-op is restricted to local play. Living alone and working remotely makes couch co-op a tricky proposition, and the only way for me to test this is by using the PS5’s Share Play feature with another editor, but that feature won’t work until the game launches next Tuesday.

          "description": "Assassin's Creed Mirage hit PlayStation, Xbox, and PC last week and both critics and fans alike are quite happy with the series return to its roots. Unlike Assassin's Creed Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla, in which Basim is featured, Mirage is a smaller, more condensed adventure, unlike the prior open-world RPGs. Now, roughly a week later, Ubisoft has revealed that Mirage's player count is in line with Origins and Odyssey. Plus, Mirage is Ubisoft's biggest new-gen launch in terms of sales. \nThank you all for joining us on Basim's journey in 9th Century Baghdad!\n#AssassinsCreed pic.twitter.com/KnL2YxGION\nOctober 11, 2023\nAlongside the news, Ubisoft revealed some fun statistics about what Mirage players have accomplished in just six days: \n479 collective years spent parkouring the rooftops of Baghdad\n60 million Leaps of Faith\n1.2 million street cats pet\n\"With the number of players in line with past successful launches such as Assassin's Creed Origins and Assassin's Creed Odyssey, we are humbled by the positive reception,\" Ubisoft's statement reads. \"We are proud to also share that Assassin's Creed Mirage is the biggest New Gen launch in terms of units sales to date at Ubisoft (PS5, Xbox Series X/S). A big congratulations to the Bordeaux Studio and all its partners in the project for this accomplishment.\" \n\n\nWe had a great time with the game, and you can read about why in Game Informer's Assassin's Creed Mirage review. If you're still playing, or are planning to jump in soon, be sure to read Game Informer's Assassin's Creed Mirage tips and tricks.

The adventure whisks players to new locations to take on a mysterious cult while surviving that pesky zombie apocalypse. \nThis new storyline centers on techno-death cults hosted by its crazed leader, Konstantin, who believes such battles are the \"paragon of the future.\" The adventure unfolds in a Malibu villa, described in a press release as a \"deranged labyrinth of biomes where rational architecture is subverted by expanding narrative spaces.\"\n\n\nYour guess is as good as ours as to what that means, but Haus features eight new cards and new weapons, such as the long-ranged K-Rossbow and the flame-spewing Hog Roaster. Developer Dambuster Studios has not posted a trailer but did release a few screenshots that you can view below.\n\nDead Island 2 Haus launches on November 2.

That seminal entry proved that Nintendo’s iconic plumber could transition to 3D and still be the juggernaut franchise it was in 2D. It also became the blueprint for nearly every 3D platformer for the next several years. Super Mario 64 looked amazing in motion, but more importantly, it played like a dream. To say it revolutionized gaming would be an understatement. \nIn 2002, Nintendo released Super Mario Sunshine on GameCube to critical and fan acclaim.

          "description": "Nearly three years after the initial launch of the PlayStation 5, Sony has revealed a slimmer redesign. Both the disc drive model and the digital model will be updated, but these two models aren't as different as they used to be: you will now be able to purchase a disc drive separately, allowing you to upgrade a digital model to a disc-compatible version. Both versions will be available this November, and will eventually replace the current model of PS5 altogether.\n\"The new PS5 has been reduced in volume by more than 30%, and weight by 18% and 24% compared to the previous models,\" the PlayStation blog post reads. It also mentions that the new covers have different textures, which isn't immediately clear from the pictures. \"There are four separate cover panels,\" it says, \"with the top portion in a glossy look, while the bottom remains in matte.\" This does raise questions about the compatibility of console shells Sony currently sells that allow you to change the look of your console, but this question is not addressed in the announcement.\nThe slim PS5 with a disc drive will still cost $499.99. The PS5 digital edition retails at $449.99, a $50 increase from the original digital edition. \nIf you do buy a newer digital version and decide to upgrade it to a disc version, the drive will cost you $79.99 in the US, €119.99 in Europe, £99.99 in the UK, and ¥11,980 in Japan. The total cost of a digital console and a disc drive is a little more expensive than buying a disc drive version outright. The console will include a new horizontal stand to set the console on its side, and a vertical stand will be on sale for $29.99 USD | 29.99 EURO | 24.99 GBP | 3,980 JPY. You can watch the reveal trailer below:\n\n\nFor more PlayStation 5 news, read about how president Jim Ryan is stepping down, read our list of top 5 PlayStation 5 games, and check out our gameplay breakdown for the PS5 exclusive Marvel's Spider-Man 2.\nAre you interested in this newest model of the console?

Some elements of the game hold up and others don't, but in any case, it's a fascinating historical look in multiple ways.\nYou can find our previous episode of Replay where we played Assassin's Creed right here.\n\n\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

          "description": "Microsoft's long journey to acquire gaming giant Activision Blizzard is finally nearing an end. According to The Verge, a source familiar with Microsoft's plans indicated that it was aiming for Friday, October 13, as a date to close the deal. Ignoring the infamy of the date (it seems Microsoft and Activision Blizzard executives aren't very superstitious), it's not a surprising day to choose. Back in July, the two parties in the deal jointly agreed to extend the deadline of their agreement to October 18 in order to sort out any further regulatory concerns. At the time of publishing, that date is only twelve days away, so the deal would have to be closed soon.\nStill, the Microsoft legal department will have to deal with a few more legal challenges before they're completely out of the woods. After restructuring the terms of the merger to grant Ubisoft the rights to stream Activision Blizzard games in the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority granted the deal a preliminary approval, but the regulator still has to make a final assessment sometime before October 18. Still, Microsoft and Activision Blizzard each took this as a major win.\nWe are encouraged by this positive development in the CMA’s review process. We presented solutions that we believe fully address the CMA’s remaining concerns related to cloud game streaming, and we will continue to work toward earning approval to close prior to the October 18…\nSeptember 22, 2023\nThis news followed the companies' victory over the Federal Trade Commission back in July. At this point, it seems fairly likely that the deal will go through, ending a saga that began almost two years ago. After documents from the hearings leaked and revealed Microsoft's hybrid console, a new Xbox model, and plans to acquire other companies like Sega and Bungie, Microsoft is probably ready to leave the entire matter behind it.\n[Source: The Verge]\nHow do you feel about the acquisition coming to a close?

From the acclaimed anime Cyberpunk: Edgerunners to the 2.0 update of 2077 and the release of Phantom Liberty, public perception of the series has largely turned around. Today, CD Projekt Red announced that they're taking the next step with the franchise – creating a live-action production.\nThe game studio is partnering with Anonymous Content, a media company known for its work on shows like Mr. Robot and films like The Revenant. The project will be produced by Garrett Kemble, David Levine, Ryan Schwartz, Bard Dorros, and Charlie Scully, who will develop the project \"in close collaboration with the Cyberpunk 2077 creative team.\" That said, this is still in the earliest stages; there's still no screenwriter attached to the project.\nThere are still many questions in the air about the project. They've yet to announce (and perhaps, decide) whether it will be a film or a series. And while the project is \"set in the world\" of Cyberpunk 2077, there are a lot of approaches they could take. No actors have been attached to the project either, so whether Keanu Reeves or Idris Elba will show up is still up in the air. You can read the full press release here.\nFor more Cyberpunk, here's what we thought of the latest expansion, Phantom Liberty, and here's a list of tips and tricks to help you get started.

It did so randomly, with a quick tweet announcing the news. \nRed Dead Redemption, including Undead Nightmare, now supports up to 60 FPS on PlayStation 5 via backward compatibility. pic.twitter.com/XMLIe6gYo4\nOctober 4, 2023\nElsewhere in the same update, Rockstar added an option to enable subtitles upon first booting the game. The update also includes general bug fixes and improvements, although Rockstar didn't list which. \nIf you bought Red Dead Redemption on PS4 recently to play on PS5, or were looking for a reason to do so, this new update that adds a 60 FPS option might be the reason you were looking for. Now, Rockstar please bring 60 FPS to Red Dead Redemption II on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. And bring 60 FPS in Red Dead Redemption to Xbox Series X/S, too. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Red Dead Redemption review and then read our column on remembering the mundane greatness of John Marston. After that, read Game Informer's ranking of every single Rockstar game. \nDo you like Red Dead Redemption or Red Dead Redemption II more? Let us know in the comments below!",

The tricky part is many ECDs are connected to each other and can regenerate instantly, so you must figure out the right order to successfully complete your mission. \nOur reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Dark Side support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. Additionally, there are two playable demos if you want to test the game. Support for Amiga and AtariST will be available later! Please contact us if you have some other release.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build.
