          "description": "Roll up, roll up.\nCircus Electrique is quick to pique the interest of any fans of a turn-based tactical RPG, especially those who loved Darkest Dungeon. However, its unique design raises the question of what Darkest Dungeon would be like if it were filled with mechanical mimes and pretentious police officers, all while being set in a gritty, steampunk Victorian London. Zen Studios has answered with this eccentric part circus-sim, part story-driven RPG, and unfortunately the answer is 'not as good'.\nFrom the moment the game begins, players take on the role of Amelia, the niece of Electrique's ringleader and a young journalist commissioned to report the re-opening of the show following a deadly accident ten years prior. Coincidentally, the accident's victim was Amelia's mother, so there is a prevalent tension between niece and uncle. However, upon Amelia's visit, an unexpected turn of events unravels with 'The Maddening,' an incident that plunges London into chaos and turns its inhabitants into vicious enemies. So, instead of reporting the Circus' re-opening, Amelia takes it upon herself to discover the source of The Maddening and relies on Circus Electrique for support.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Widely regarded as two of the greatest video games of all time, the ports run like butter on Nintendo's hybrid console, no doubt introducing a swathe of new players to the world of Aperture Science along with characters like Wheatley and the esteemed GlaDOS.\nOne of the running jokes with Valve is that the publisher is seemingly incapable of creating a third entry to their popular IP. Franchises like Left 4 Dead, Portal, and Half-Life have all more or less come to an end with their respective sophomore titles (though you could argue that Half-Life Alyx is technically the third mainline entry to the Half-Life series), but this hasn't stopped fans from requesting and petitioning for more of that Valve goodness.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Aside from some pre-release Mario footage, the advert also contains a small number of clips from the cancelled Kirby's Air Ride game on the N64.

          "description": "During the first wave of RTX 3080 reviews, when we had no idea of the graphics card supply shortage to come, I remember being really impressed by the Asus Tuf Gaming model. It didn't look particularly special on the outside, but it consistently beat even more expensive models in terms of thermals and performance. I resolved to get one for myself, but things went mad and I only eventually managed to get one through my work. Now though, you can get the upgraded version of that high-performer at a more reasonable price: £650 for the Tuf Gaming OC V2, an overclocked model offering excellent performance for £400 below this model's UK RRP. \nRead more",

Nine times out of ten, it's a sign that something's gone wrong further up the line - that someone, somewhere, has sent out a train with half its usual number of carriages, and is therefore destined to ruin everyone's day in the process by cramming us all in like a pack of sardines. \nIn Afterburn's adorable train puzzler Railbound, however, two carriages are a cause for celebration. In a game that's about guiding numbered compartments onto the back of an engine (using a limited number of track tiles to get them there in the right order), two-carriage puzzles offer the perfect amount of cerebral head-scratching. They've got a bit more bite than simply guiding a single carriage to its destination, but they're not so complicated that they'll repeatedly make you reach for the hint button to help you fill in the gaps. Railbound has a tendency to be a bit too abstract in its later stages, but more on that in a sec. All you need to know right now is that there are plenty of smart ideas to wrap your head around here, and that you'll be grinning from ear to ear by the time you reach the end of the line. \nRead more",

          "description": "Back in the mists of time of 2014, the original Tales From The Borderlands followed the classic Telltale episodic template, with a new chapter dropping every three or four months. Gearbox Software's upcoming New Tales From The Borderlands, however, is going to be doing things a bit differently. As our PAX West team found out over the weekend, NuTales will still be split up into an episodic-style chapter structure, according to director of production James Lopez, but you won't have to wait several months before you can play them altogether. \nRead more",

          "description": "A truly dynamic story is a goal game designers have strived toward for decades. Worldwalker Games' Wildermyth gets closer to that goal than most. In this spellbinding RPG, players guide bands of heroes through a lifetime of adventure, embarking on dozens of short, whimsical quests wherein they grow, age, and quite literally evolve, with the potential to transform into walking trees, celestial beings, and anthropomorphised crows.\r\n\n\r\nWildermyth is an inspired example of narrative design, with some nifty tactical combat to boot. But when Nate Austin, his wife Annie, and his brother Doug began developing the game around eight years ago, the weight of emphasis between storytelling and combat was very much the other way around.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "It's day two of PAX West and to kick off our second day of game events and demos we got hands-on with a build of Neowiz's Pinocchio RPG, Lies of P. The gameplay demo caused quite a stir when it was at Gamescom earlier this year, so we made it one of our priorities to check it out here in Seattle.\nNeowiz are not actually at PAX so there wasn't anyone on the team to give us some behind-the-scenes info, but I got stuck into the demo for a solid 30 minutes, brawling with the game's angry robot lads that roamed the city's blood-washed cobbled streets.\nOverall, I had a great time with the demo. Yes, it is incredibly similar to Bloodborne in both its combat and environments but there are plenty of other elements that steer it away from FromSoftware's horror-filled gothic RPG. If you want more details instead of that short summary then check out our video below where I talk about my time with the build, and about having my arse kicked by giant mechanical automatons.

          "description": "At Gamescom I sat down with a lovely ice cold beer and two lovely lads who ran me through military real-time tactics sequel Men Of War II in a 45-minute hands-off presentation. As a total freshman to the series, I was a little intimidated by the prospect of sinking my feet into the trenches of a dense strategy bonanza, especially as things kicked off with a literal history lesson.\nBut after watching and absorbing one of the game's early missions, I can genuinely say that I'd be confident enough to give it a go when it comes out. Even perhaps, confident enough to say that I'd genuinely enjoy it quite a bit as a total newbie.\nRead more",

I almost don't want to say any more about it, not because it can be spoiled but because it seems appropriately respectful. Not in a reverent sense, you understand. It just feels like such a world should be preserved, even slightly feared, rather than trampled on by some idiot with a camera in her face.\nTo call Northern Journey \"retro\" would completely misrepresent it. It's beautiful in an ugly, desolate way reminiscent of Kenshi or Morrowind. It's translucent in its exposition but not obtuse, hostile, or obnoxiously hard. It's a bit clunky, without that ever undermining the experience. It's vaguely amateurish, yet almost consciously so, like a painter who knows their talent and intent is enough to overcome any technical flaws. This is a bloody treat and I'm so glad I got to play it.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Between its Proteus Spectrum and refreshed Hero models, the G502 has sold boatloads, and was voted as RPS readers’ favourite gaming mouse in both 2019 and 2021. Not undeservedly either, as it’s sat atop our best gaming mouse rankings for years. Making more drastic improvements to it wouldn’t therefore seem like a pressing priority, but Logitech have had a crack regardless with the new G502 X series.\r\n\n\r\nThere’s a trio of redesigned rodents in this family: the standard G502 X I’ve got on review here, the wireless G502 X Lightspeed, and the G502 X Plus, which is essentially the G502 X Lightspeed with added RGB lighting. Since prices max out at £150 / $160 for the G502 X Plus, the two Lightspeed-equipped mice could be less expensive alternatives to Razer’s new DeathAdder V3 Pro and Basilisk V3 Pro – but as the cheapest and most direct successor the G502 Hero, it’s the G502 X that’s likely to see the most desk action.

I didn’t know what to expect when I met David Ventura at the Backbeat booth, after a long opening day of the weekend-long Japanese indie gaming event BitSummit. I knew of his work - now the CEO of his self-founded studio Ichigoichie with developers based both in Japan and Sweden, Ventura has had his hands in a number of highly-influential rhythm games over the course of his career. This includes work on Gitaroo Man and Elite Beat Agents during his time in Japan at iNiS, having worked at the studio for a decade before moving to Sweden to work outside of games on educational music software. In 2018 he returned to games by founding Ichigoichie (stylised as 151A). Their first game, Hexagroove, blended strategy, rhythm and educational tools for a game that captured the building blocks of being a DJ.\r\n\n\r\nVentura was at BitSummit to showcase the successor to this game, Backbeat. It’s a bit of a departure from much of his past work, acting more like a puzzle game with a musical soul, albeit one where the act of creating and playing music together is imbued into every solution. As the crowd began to leave the bustling convention hall for the day, I went to the booth for one last demo, and the chance to speak to the person behind it all… who was sat at his demo kiosk playing the keytar.\r\n\n \nRead more",

From what I'd seen and heard, I was keen to see more of the sci-fi horror game that's not Dead Space but is also quite like Dead Space.\nSo, at this year's Geoffscom I was able to see a 20-minute presentation of some new Callisto goodness and then chat with Striking Distance Studios' chief technology officer Mark James about what I'd seen. We touched on dismemberment, 3D printers, and Shaun Of The Dead, naturally.\nRead more",

          "description": "Stories always came first for the team at NOVECT. The critical and commercial success of The House In Fata Morgana surprised many upon the title’s international release, including the developers themselves. Headlines were made when the game shot temporarily to the spot of most critically-acclaimed game of all time on Metacritic, despite being still relatively under the radar beforehand. Fata Morgana first released to the public in Japan in 2012, and gained a cult following before its eventual successful international release. The reason for it's acclaim? Storytelling. Every single review praised Fata Morgana's surprising and enthralling twists and turns as what made this visual novel a must-play title, even for non-fans of the genre.\r\n\n\r\nAt the time development started, NOVECT were less a development studio, and more of a group of univeristy friends with minimal coding experience but a love for telling stories; a hobby project run by friends on the side of university and normal jobs inside and out of the games industry, only becoming a fully-fledged studio later down the line. Fast forward to today, NOVECT are a firmly-established indie developer with games and multimedia adaptations of their work under their belt, and new project still mysteriously known as \"Project Code Name 'M'\" now in the works. Originally starting development in 2019 and announced earlier this year, Project M had its first public demo at this month’s Bitsummit indie gaming showcasing in Kyoto.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Even though you can craft your own buildings and gather materials, you don’t need to have played any gathering or crafting classes. With a base to customise, crops to tend to and a pasture full of animals to pet, it’s easy to see why comparisons were drawn to other farming games such as Stardew Valley.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "We've got a pretty good line in interesting folk traditions here at RPS. I grew up in a county where staying up all night at the stone circle to welcome the Summer Solstice was an annual tradition (later augmented by a woman wearing antlers offering a selection of downers and hallucinogens), and as a child I had an unnecessary encounter with the Salisbury Hob-Nob. For the past few years Alice0 has gone to the Burryman's Parade, gracing us with pictures of that most wholesome gentleman. Rural traditions are fun if you're part of them, but to outsiders they can be unsettling at best. \nThis is relevant to my thinking about Saturnalia, an upcoming survival horror game by Italian studio Santa Ragione, where a small group of outsiders try to escape a village on the night of an ancient ritual. I've been playing a preview build of Saturnalia for the last week or so, and also got to talk about it with the studio director Pietro Righi Riva. \"I usually tell people, 'Oh, you should make a game in like six months', and I have tried to do that in the past,\" he tells me. \"This one just kind of got out of hand. I found an email yesterday, as I was looking for finishing the credits, about me discussing some story items in April 2017.\" And, while I am sure that most developers don't wish they'd been making a video game in the middle of the pandemic, I think the extra time may have allowed Santa Ragione to make something excellent.\nRead more",

If only mere words could convey just how much “like RimWorld” Stranded: Alien Dawn is – other 3D-ified clones exist, like last year’s Going Medieval, but here, even the exact spaceship-wrecking premise matches that of Ludeon Studios' seminal survival sim. \r\n\n \nRead more",

In fact, their craic contributed a great deal to my enjoyment of the strangest FPS I've played in a while - one where I was forever grinning at the screen like an idiot.

Part deckbuilder, part roguelike and part tower defence, this is a real-time strategy game played by the seat of your pants, where a rolling deck of cards determines not only what kind of defences you can build, but also what buffs, spells and additional forces you can deploy to help defend your keep from the oncoming hordes.

Unlike other monitors of this magnitude, it can also rotate into portrait mode, leaving the top curve towering over you like an unsympathetic Victorian headmaster. \r\n\n\r\nI actually enjoy a touch of design madness creeping into the occasional piece of PC gear, regardless of whether it can hang with the best gaming monitors that sensible people might buy.

A game like Victoria 3, where the whole point is making decisions that have country-wide effects and outcomes years in the future, is essentially operating in a different language to any I understand.\nI'm trying to learn new languages, though, so it's not an unwelcome challenge. The problem is that previewing Victoria 3 is quite an advanced level to dive in, the Paradox GSG equivalent of being a live translator for a UN summit when you're only just about able to read the French version of The Famous Five. In a presentation before I and others were let loose on the better part of a week with the game, it was claimed that Victoria 3 is the best yet for onboarding newcomers, with a deep and detailed tutorial system. And to that I say: kinda. Luckily, the AI in Victoria 3 is so advanced it's better at playing the game than I am.\nRead more",

Hyenas never gave me a chance.\nI sat in a 20-minute presentation of the game and tried my level best to understand SEGA's stab at a live-service FPS. Instead, I exited the booth with whiplash... and a sense of curiosity. Somewhere inside the game's insufferable tone is a kernel of cleverness, I just need to get my mitts on it to confirm my suspicions.

This latest rumination on voyeurism also delves into storytelling, sex, death, religion, love, lust, lies, pretence (as distinct from acting), power and self. That's a lot to pack into the partial, out of order clips of three different films, which manage to span both decades and careers. The central figure is Marissa Marcel, an almost-star actor who made three movies before disappearing. So the question you strive to answer, by looking through unedited takes and rehearsal footage, is: what happened to Marissa Marcel?\nIn typical Barlow fashion, the entirety of the footage isn't easily spooled through. From one starting clip you're able to watch it, flick back and forth through the recording, and pause it to use the in-game search tool to focus on a face or object on screen. Selecting it will then take you to that face or a similar object in a different clip, and eventually you build up a much fuller catalogue of footage.\nNow. Immortality also talks quite a bit about sex, in various ways and for various reasons, and there is female nudity. So yes, you can enhance! Zoom! on a tit. And the game will take you to another clip featuring a similar tit. Ba-dum, tsh!\nRead more",

The City of Lights, a place celebrated for its art, invention, culture, and architecture now resembles The Gates of Hell, a vision soon to be crafted by Rodin himself. The streets are awash with blood and bodies — innocent civilians, rebellious conspirators, and even the king's own army lying in miserable piles of broken flesh.\nAnd the king himself? This citywide massacre is his doing, the heart of his capital torn in two by a seemingly unstoppable army of robotic soldiers. Far from being the loyal guardians and entertainers of Paris, as initially designed, the automaton army has instead become her oppressor, stal…",

          "description": "We don't want it, 2K\nFifteen years later, BioShock remains one of the most recognizable and beloved series in gaming, and publisher 2K is still releasing updates to support the series. Or, more specifically, to make the games run through their own launcher, as evidenced by the patch notes from both older updates and a new one (via PC Gamer). This time around they even labeled the patch as a \"Quality of Life Update,\" when all it did was enable linking to 2K accounts and added the new launcher \"which includes a store to purchase new content.\"\nSo they're forcing yet another game launcher on us, but what really has fans peeved is that this new update has rendered the games unplayable for players running them on Linux. At first, it seemed to just be BioShock Infinite that was affected, but now it's looking like the entire series is a bust. The Linux Gaming subreddit is full of players decrying the changes, and trying to find solutions to fix the problem. Some players are expressing their wish that Steam would let them access earlier builds rather than forcing them to use the most recent version, and I'm kind of surprised that wasn't an option already.\n\nNaturally, fans took to the review section on Steam to voice their discontent, where one user said that 2K's launcher is riddled with bugs, crashes, and corrupted saves.\nI have my BioShock collection on my PlayStation so I'm in the clear, but man, I am feeling the frustration on behalf of PC gamers. Here's hoping that 2K gets the message soon and decides to scrap the launcher altogether, or at the very least releases a patch to fix the games for Linux users.\nRecently I've been partial to arguments about why it's important to own physical media, and I have to say this situation is only pushing me further into that camp. If I spent money on a game, I certainly want to be able to play it without the meddling of a company years after the game's release.\nThe post BioShock is unplayable for Linux users with new update appeared first on Destructoid.",

And several reports say that a healthy amount of Assassin's Creed will be there.\nBloomberg reports today, confirming other reports, that Ubisoft is set to announce several new Assassin's Creed games this coming Saturday.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Fr3cS3MtY\nAccording to Bloomberg's sources, Ubisoft plans to show off a mobile title and two major games. The first is code-named Red and set in Japan, being developed by Ubisoft's Quebec City office.\nThe second is code-named Neo or Hexe, according to Bloomberg, and is set during the later Holy Roman Empire, specifically revolving around the witch trials. This is being developed by Ubisoft Montreal.\nBoth of these are reportedly part of Assassin's Creed Infinity, a platform for the series that will contain multiple settings that has been previously reported on. Neither game is expected to release until 2024 at the earliest.\nThe future of Assassin's Creed\nUbisoft has already confirmed it plans to showcase Assassin's Creed Mirage as well. Though it hasn't revealed further official details about that game, it has been the subject of leaks and reports as well.\n\nSuffice it to say, we'll likely be seeing a lot of Assassin's Creed this weekend. And while it might not be everyone's cup of tea, I'm actually pretty interested in all of this.\nAssassin's Creed taking a platform approach could be interesting. I enjoy the more recent games in the series but never got around to finishing Valhalla due to how huge it was. Focused experiences with a bunch of different time periods could be intriguing.\nEither way, it won't be long until we know for sure. Ubisoft is airing its Forward stream this Saturday, at 12:00 p.m. PT / 3:00 p.m. ET. You can watch it on Ubisoft's Twitch channel here.\nThe post Several Assassin’s Creed games are reportedly set to be revealed this weekend appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's a little bit of Overwatch mixed in with mobile suits.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVWpQDJtxHk\nGundam Evolution will feature mainstays from throughout the Gundam-verse, duking it out on the field of battle. Today's trailer spotlights a melee-configured Zaku with some hefty axe swings, the Mahiroo from Turn A Gundam, and the titular Unicorn Gundam.\nThese, alongside classics from throughout the series, all have their own weapons and abilities they bring to the battlefield. Personally, I'm rooting for the Guntank. He may not be as shiny as something newer like the Barbatos, but darn it, the Guntank is cool.\nMatches feature several objective-based modes, including Destruction, Domination, and Point Capture.\nA new type of Gundam battle\nThe PC launch of Gundam Evolution is currently set for a global launch on September 22 in Japan, which puts it at 7 p.m. PDT on September 21 for North America.  The launch will also mark the start of Season One.\nThere will also be cosmetics to purchase, of course. So if you want to deck out your mobile suit to stand out from the crowd, feel free to do so. It worked for Char, after all.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EFI6v49v68\nWhile Steam players get in on the carnage right away, console players will have to wait. Currently, the team is planning to launch Gundam Evolution on December 1 in Japan, or 6 p.m. PST on November 30 in North America.\nOnce the end of November rolls around, Gundam Evolution will launch on both the current and previous generation of PlayStation and Xbox consoles.\nThe post Gundam Evolution is a free-to-play hero shooter going live on Steam this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

A controller, headset, and console cover for the PS5 are all getting gray camo, as part of a new collection for PS5 owners.\nThe Gray Camouflage Collection variants of the PS5 DualSense controller and Pulse 3D wireless headset. Alongside those accessories, there is a console cover for both the disc drive-less and disc-capable PS5.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0qDTET_tvY\nIn the accompanying PlayStation blog, Sony says the pattern subtly incorporates the iconic \"PlayStation Shapes\" into the pattern. And it's true, they are in there, as little details you can notice between the splotches.\nThe Gray Camouflage Collection will be available this fall, with pre-orders starting next week. The DualSense wireless controller and PlayStation 5 console covers will roll out first, with a global launch on October 14. The Pulse 3D wireless headset is set to roll out sometime in December.\nTactical fidelity\nSony has been steadily rolling out a number of console covers. In June, the console manufacturer launched several different variants, including the Starlight Blue, Galactic Purple, and Nova Pink. That's alongside the previously available Cosmic Red and Mdnight Black.\nWhile I haven't opted to pick up a new color for my PlayStation 5 yet, I did pick up a Midnight Black DualSense. It's a pretty nice controller, and has lasted a good while.\nAs for the actual functionality of the camouflage, I cannot say. The sheer size of the PS5 might make obscuring its presence in your living room difficult.\nStill, if you're looking for different options for DualSense controllers, the Gray Camo will at least make your PS5 controller fairly distinct. No price has been announced yet, though console covers have usually gone for $54.99 and DualSense color variants tend to add a little extra.\nThe post Sony is rolling out Gray Camouflage accessories for the PlayStation 5 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Standing in their way are a slew of familiar and not-so-familiar faces, including returning gangland boss Sabuko, her obnoxious step-brother Ken, (which die-hard fans will remember from River City Girls Zero), and River City's most hated antagonist — the sibling's murderous father Sabu.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OrWkuUfHlk\nFortunately, our hometown heroes will not be charging into battle alone. Not only will Kyoko and Misako be aided by long-time Kunio-kun protagonists Kunio and Riki, but Double Dragon's Marian and River City Underground's Provie will also be stepping up to the plate, bringing their own unique, hard-hitting combat styles. The trailer debuts RCG 2's four-player co-op action, which will help the River City Girls even the odds further against armies of bullies, street criminals, gangsters, and other dangerous roustabouts that stand in the way of street justice. Put up yer dukes...\nRiver City Girls 2 will launch later this year on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

Prior to that, though, Unknown Worlds and Krafton will host two playtest weekends, on September 9 through 11 and September 16 through 18.\nThe primary goal of these sessions will be to stress test the servers. Getting signed up for the playtest is pretty easy, too.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef5ajtJuKns\nHow to sign-up for Moonbreaker playtest\nLog onto Steam\nFind Moonbreaker on the store (link)\nClick \"Request Access\" under the playtest section\nConfirm!\nEasy enough, right?\nPaint it, black (or any other color you'd like)\nDuring these weekend playtests, players will have access to the full game, barring some systems and the store. This also includes all Season 1 units and Captains. While those will be gradually unlocked in the Steam Early Access version, the Moonbreaker playtest will make them available right away so everything can be tested.\nAll progress will be wiped too, with one notable exception. Paint jobs will carry forward into the Early Access. Since painting the virtual miniature figurines of Moonbreaker seems like a big draw, that's nice to see.\n\nUnknown Worlds also warns that these tests are meant to push the servers to their limits, and so interruptions and emergency maintenance can occur.\nIt's a pretty easy playtest to sign up for, though. And with the Early Access not far off, this is a nice way to test the waters to see if this new Unknown Worlds experience is worth checking out on launch.

Takashi Tokita served as director for the original game (among other duties), and was also a producer on the 2022 Switch edition.\nIt's hard to believe that Live a Live clawed its way up from a 1994 SNES exclusive only released in Japan, to where it is today. It was only a glimmer in the eye of many JRPG fans, back in an era when importing was even tougher to do; but now it's easily accessible on a worldwide marketplace, on the widely successful Switch no less. It just goes to show you how far game preservation can come when it's done with care.\nAs of late, Tokita has been sharing a ton of fan art for the game, as well as stories from fans all over the world. Many of those fans are located in Japan, but there's a wide spread of folks from multiple regions: showcasing the staying power (and wide appeal to this day) of Live a Live.

          "description": "Farewell to a Downtown Nekketsu legend\nJapanese developer Miracle Kidz! has reported the sad news that its president, Mitsuhiro Yoshida, passed away \"suddenly\" on August 30. Yoshida, who has been part of the games industry for many decades, is best known as the co-director of one of the most popular brawlers in history, River City Ransom.\nDescribed by his Miracle Kidz! colleagues as the \"father\" of the Downtown Nekketsu franchise, Yoshida — alongside co-director Hiroyuki Sekimoto — may not have been responsible for the creation of the Kunio-kun franchise, but certainly helmed its most well-known and widely played entry. River City Ransom, (known in its native Japan as Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari) launched on the NES in 1989 and is one of the first titles to marry the belt-scrolling brawler action of the series with a non-linear RPG structure. The international success of RCR helped paved the way for a slew of sequels and spin-offs.\nhttps://twitter.com/miracle_kidz/status/1565907621072470016?s=20&t=1EUKMC8KdRfhUOeqUT2pDg\nYoshida would continue to work with the franchise, directing the goofy NES port of Nekketsu Koko Dodgeball (Super Dodge Ball), before starting up a studio comprised of many former employees of old-school developer Technos Japan. Since founding Miracle Kidz!, Yoshida has continued to work on several titles set both in and out of the Kunio-kun universe, and was reportedly working on a new game right up until his untimely passing.\nAs a mainstay of any NES owner's catalog, River City Ransom has provided brawler fans with hours upon hours of double-fisted action — paving the way for the series' enduring appeal, recognized today in the form of WayForward's popular River City Girls franchise.\nWe at Destructoid offer our condolences to his family and friends.\nThe post River City Ransom director Mitsuhiro Yoshida passes away appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "\"I'm not going to be able to show anything until it's ready\"\nTwo years ago, Microsoft announced a new Fable at an Xbox Games Showcase event. I completely forgot that even happened, and was reminded of its existence this past weekend. Head of Microsoft Studios, Matt Booty, had something to say about that at a PAX West Microsoft panel (which you can watch right here at roughly the 45:00 mark).\nHere's what Booty had to say about not showing the game off as of late:\n\"Part of my job is giving air cover to the team, right? So they don't want to show stuff early before it's ready to go, but if there's one game where that's kind of flipped around, where every time I see something I say, 'we should show this', it's Fable. Because there's a lot of cool stuff...uh...the team has made it very clear that I am not going to be able to show anything until it's ready. But Playground...what I'll say is that the craft and dedication that they brought to Forza Horizon, every bit of that will be applied to Fable. They get it.\"\n\n\"It's Fable\" is an interesting statement that's worth unpacking. Surely, the name still means something as the announcement garnered discussion; but Fable has been through the wringer, with an uneven set of core games, as well as a few odd spinoffs and a now-defunct digital card game. Reading a bit more into it, \"it's Fable\" has some baggage attached to it, and showing off the game outside of a cute little teaser will require a bit more finesse.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVkSZXPklQ4\nThe post Microsoft isn’t ready to show Fable yet, and I forgot there’s another Fable appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Sony veteran bows out after decades-long tenure\nSony Interactive Entertainment has announced that one of the PlayStation brand's longest-running developers, Masayasu Ito, will retire from the company at the end of September. Ito's departure was first communicated to Bloomberg, before the publisher made its own statement on the official SIE website.\nMasayasu Ito started with Sony way back in 1986, where he worked on the company's range of vehicular stereo systems — back when audio equipment was the cornerstone of Sony's technological output. Ito would not join the PlayStation brand until the year 2000, when his design know-how would be put to use in the development of PS2 accessories.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaAY-jAjm0w&t=1s\nIto would become a key player in the division, becoming part of the architecture team for the PS4 and PS4 Pro consoles, as well as the popular handheld console PlayStation Portable (PSP). Most recently, Ito had the unenviable task of co-engineering Sony's most recent hardware release, PS5. Creating powerful, next-gen technology against the backdrop of severely hampered production, component, and distribution shortages is no small feat, though the console would see its heralded arrival on November 12, 2020.\nIto's contribution to the PlayStation brand's success in the past two decades is clearly his legacy, having overseen the release of some of the best-selling game consoles of all time. Ito will retire from Sony Interactive Entertainment on October 1, 2022, when he will be replaced by Lin Tao, who currently serves as SIE's SVP of Finance, Corporate Development, and Strategy.\nThe post PlayStation hardware architect Masayasu Ito to retire this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, the fun with physics gameplay left such an impression on me that it’s been on my hit list for years. The problem is, the memory that stuck out most for me was its ugly-as-sin graphics and oppressive draw fog.\nThankfully, THQ Nordic and Black Forest Games decided to go all the way with the series and gussy up Destroy All Humans 2 in the same way it did for the original title.

Hailing from Detroit is Riley Stone, a rocker who came up through the indie music scene. Meanwhile Rochelle Robert is a former child pageant star who gets discovered and makes her way into the spotlight.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5LO9H8YCfM\nThe two collide and grow closer, and it's your job to figure out how, why, and what happened after. Riley & Rochelle lets you piece together music, journal entries, and information to figure out the story. Maybe, even, whether anyone gets a decent ending.\nThe game is a collaboration between Tim Sheinman and Natalia Yanchak, with art from Mack Chater, Murray Somerwolff, and Josiah Whitfield. And the Sheinman Games label is what caught my eye about this in the first place.\n\nHe was a boy, she was a girl\nSheinman has made several investigation-centric games in the past. One in particular I dug was Rivals, a similar mix of music and detective work that had the player piece together the history of a band and its falling out.\nJust the general idea of pulling together scraps of info for a VH1's Behind The Music style program is interesting enough. But the music here is spot-on, too. A clever mix of information hunting and good tunes makes for a pretty unique style of detective game.\nRiley & Rochelle is currently aiming for a launch on PC and Mac.

It was a strategy game in-joke for so long that I couldn't believe it was really happening. I was provided a preview build of the upcoming socio-economic grand strategy game thanks to Paradox. To quote Sidra Holland and Jackie Chiles, it's \"real, and it's fantastic.\" And soon, you too can politick to your heart's content when the game releases on October 25, 2022.\nFor those of you present who aren't cool enough to know what the Victoria series is all about, an introduction is in order. Victoria is a grand strategy game series aptly set during the Victorian era. Whereas other entries in the Paradox family of grand strategy games focus on war or lineage,…",

I just didn't know it yet. Little hints and bread crumbs were laying there. Percolating theories were just waiting to be blown open to something big. And I just kept tugging at the threads.\nImmortality is the latest game from Barlow and co., and it sees Barlow returning to full-motion video similar to Her Story and Telling Lies. The most obvious difference is how the experience itself handles; rather than typing queries into a database, you have a reel setup similar to a classic Moviola machine and a crosshair.\nPoint that crosshair at something that catches your eye, and Im…",

If you were here a few months back when we scoped out a similar Indonesian folklore horror game, Pamali, you'll see some similarities with this one as it features Taiwanese folklore instead.

Drop into the stream tonight to test this one out with us! It's super highly rated on Steam despite being a newer niche pick, but that's perfect.

          "description": "Kratos is still learning some new tricks\nGod of War Ragnarok is on its way, with some all-new battles for Kratos and his son Atreus to wind up in. Today, we got a quick hit of some combat, showing off new moves Kratos will have in November.\nAs part of Game Informer's cover story for Ragnarok, the team has already talked about changes coming to Kratos' arsenal. Today's video shows just what that looks like in action. We see him running around an arena, beating the daylights out of some merfolk-looking enemies.\nA key component of Kratos' move set, as the video describes, is the idea of playing with your food. The god of war can really send enemies flying and bouncing around, as well as employ some elemental moves.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QZhk4w66_8\nThese elemental moves are part of a new system for Kratos' weapons. The Leviathan Axe can bring out frost magic, while the Blades of Chaos elicit fire. By holding or mashing the Triangle button, the weapons become infused with the elements, doing extra damage to enemies.\nHe's really in his element here\nIt's a quick little burst of gameplay, with the video coming in at under two minutes. Still, it's nice to see some gameplay of God of War Ragnarok. I've been curious as to how different the combat would feel in Ragnarok versus the 2018 iteration. Seems like Sony Santa Monica Studios have found some ways of adding on top of what was already a pretty solid set of mechanics.\nThe written portion of Game Informer's cover story also talks about the shields, both the Dauntless and Stonewall versions, as well as some other granular bits of gameplay detail. It might still seem far away, but November is inching ever closer. And with it, plenty more enemies for Kratos to smash apart.\nThe post God of War Ragnarok shows off a quick burst of combat in new gameplay appeared first on Destructoid.",

Developer 1047 Games has announced it’s finally bringing the game out of its lengthy beta and launching it in 1.0 next month. It also revealed plans to create another title within the Splitgate universe. But to facilitate work on this next project, it will cease feature development of Splitgate.\n1047 explains in a press release that it’s developing a new shooter in Unreal Engine 5 set in the world of Splitgate, which means it will also feature portals. There aren't any more details beyond this, but it will be the team’s full-time project going forward. \nAs such, 1047 is launching Splitgate out of beta on September 15, but it will move away from creating substantial content after that. However, the team assures fans that Splitgate will remain online. The game’s launch will kick off a new season, which includes a new, free battle pass featuring an infinite number of levels along with new characters, skins, and other goodies. Splitgate’s weekly featured playlists, and item drops will continue, and the team will still work on smaller fixes and updates. \nYou can read 1047's full statement below (click to enlarge):\nSplitgate launched in PC beta in 2019, but the game really caught fire when its console beta began in 2021. The game became so popular on PlayStation and Xbox that servers regularly became congested, to the point that 1047 decided to postpone the full launch and keep the game in an indefinite beta to focus on further stabilizing the online infrastructure as the project continued to receive more funding. Season 0 began last August, adding a new map, game mode, and other features.",

Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. \nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. \nWatch on Twitch!\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, along with Andrew Reiner and Blake Hester, as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

Discovery confirms. \nThe first DC Fandome took place in 2020, serving as a livestream alternative to in-person conventions in the wake of the pandemic. It featured virtual panels with celebrities and filmmakers that provided new announcements, trailers, and early looks at all things DC media. In terms of video games, the 2020 and 2021 editions gave us substantial new looks at Gotham Knights and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. \nIn a statement to Popverse, Warner Bros. Discovery explains the decision by writing:\nFandome’s cancellation is an unfortunate blow in the ongoing transition resulting from April’s Warner Bros./Discovery merger. Although only two years old, Fandome has found great success, generating millions of views. Last year's show was highlighted by new trailers for The Batman, Black Adam, and The Flash. Unfortunately, the DC film slate has largely been flipped on its head since then as several projects have been delayed (Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, Shazam! Fury of the Gods), in limbo (The Flash), or canceled (Batgirl). \nWhile we won't see them during DC's big event, Gotham Knights launches on October 21, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League arrives sometime in 2023.\n[Source:  Popverse]",

It also features the first-ever look at the four house common rooms in Hogwarts Legacy, a sneak peek of some of the easter eggs in the game, and more. \nThis new featurette runs more than four minutes long and gives players the most in-depth look at the actual school of Hogwarts in this game thus far. As noted in the video, the design of Hogwarts is based on the eight Harry Potter movies and the books written by controversial author J.K. Rowling, who will undoubtedly be making money from the sales of this game. \nCheck out the featurette for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Hogwarts is looking great, as are the four common rooms. What’s especially interesting is it gives viewers a look at the Hufflepuff common room, which has rarely been seen on screen in the wizarding world, as pointed out in the video. \nWhat’s more, the featurette also contains information about linking your WB Games account to your Harry Potter Fan Club account. Doing so will automatically bring your Fan Club wand into the game alongside your Hogwarts house, which can be determined on the Fan Club’s site through a special sorting quiz. You’ll also unlock some in-game rewards for doing so, too, including a special decorative house robe and a beaked skull mask. Check them out in the gallery below: \n\nFor more, read about how Hogwarts Legacy has been delayed from 2022 to February 10, 2023, and then check out the unique PlayStation 5 DualSense features for Hogwarts Legacy.

It seems Assassin's Creed Mirage will be the big highlight of the show, but it's possible we learn more about Assassin's Creed Infinity, which is Ubisoft's in-development Assassin's Creed live-service platform. We might even learn about non-Assassin's Creed games, too. \nAssassin's Creed Mirage is the next Assassin's Creed game.\n#AssassinsCreed pic.twitter.com/92LoEcrrWs\nSeptember 1, 2022\nIf rumors and leaks about Assassin's Creed Mirage are correct, we're in for a game set in Baghdad with Basim, a major character from Assassin's Creed Valhalla (if you know, you know), as the protagonist. Leaks indicate that he's not yet an assassin at the start of Mirage and instead, a thief who comes to discover the Hidden Ones, which later become the Assassin's order in the series. Rumors also point to this game being a much more stripped back take on the franchise, feeling more like older games in the series rather than the massive and sprawling open-world RPGs of late.\nThe potential for this to feel like a bridge between classic Assassin's Creed and new Assassin's Creed has me incredibly excited. I love the new games, especially Origins and Odyssey, but they're downright exhausting. An Assassin's Creed game I can beat in less than 80 hours? Sign me up!\nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's ranking of every Assassin's Creed game and then catch up on everything announced during the Assassin's Creed 15th Anniversary Celebration stream that aired earlier this summer. \nAre you excited about Mirage?

          "description": "In a new blog post, Xbox head Phil Spencer discussed Microsoft’s intentions for Activision Blizzard’s IPs following its ongoing acquisition of the company. Among those plans, naturally, is to bolster the value of Xbox Game Pass by adding Activision Blizzard’s library of titles, including Call of Duty, Overwatch, and Diablo.\nSpencer discusses expanding player choice through Game Pass by offering library titles for an affordable subscription fee, appealing to players of various budgets. Spencer hopes that including Activision Blizzard games will make the service more appealing to existing and potential subscribers. \nSpencer also reiterates Microsoft’s promise to keep popular Activision Blizzard franchises multiplatform, citing its handling of Minecraft as an example. Additionally, the company hopes to expand Activision’s portfolio to mobile platforms and make them available to play on other devices via cloud streaming. \nMicrosoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard is projected to be completed sometime during the summer of 2023. After that, it's anyone’s guess as to how long it will be before we see these franchises land on Game Pass. On the Blizzard side, Overwatch 2 launches in free-to-play early access on October 4, and Diablo IV is seemingly years away. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II releases in October, but the series will reportedly skip 2023, meaning the first entry under the Microsoft banner won't be until 2024 at the earliest. \n[Source: Microsoft]",

As misfortune had it, it came out while I was out of town, but my Dad went and picked it up from our local GameStop for me. Like an absolute dork, I remember spending weeks looking at the picture of the box he sent me, practically counting the nanoseconds until I could play it myself. \nAnd when I did, it was everything I could've hoped. I was admittedly a less savvy media viewer back then and truly believed its story was unlike anything else.

A new cinematic trailer shown during Gamescom reveals a November release date, and it runs down the wacky cast of characters and why you'll be riddling them with bullets. \nThe largely CG trailer sprinkles in a bit of in-game action, though you should check out this previous gameplay video for a better taste of the over-the-top combat. We’re introduced to Grave’s allies who band together to take on a fearsome foursome of antagonists looking to rule the world (probably). Fans of the PS2 games and the anime that spawned from them will be happy to know that G.O.R.E. looks as bombastic and absurd as they'd expect. Newcomers that enjoy bullets, blood, and insanity will likely feel right at home. \n\n\nGungrave G.O.R.E. launches November 22 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

As far as why, there’s no official reason as of yet but considering Netflix’s past, it’s likely that Resident Evil didn’t meet expectations in terms of both critical and audience response. The show will now join many other shows canceled after just one season at the streamer including Cowboy Bebop, The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance, and more.\nDeadline notes that Resident Evil’s release came right after the highly anticipated Season 4 of Stranger Things, which might have led to its less-than-stellar first weekend on the service. However, the series still debuted in the number two spot, behind Stranger Things, pulling in 72.7 million watch hours. Deadline reports that viewers watched Resident Evil for 73.3 million hours in its second week, taking the number three spot on Netflix, before dropping out of Netflix’s Top 10 by week three. \nThis isn’t Netflix’s first foray into the world of Resident Evil, though. Its 2021 movie, Resident Evil Infinite Darkness, holds that title, but that anime series wasn’t well-received either. For more about the series, check out this retrospective video that looks back at 25 years of Resident Evil. \n[Source: Deadline]\nDid you watch Resident Evil on Netflix? What did you think of it?

Longtime DMC director Hideaki Itsuno wanted to hit a \"homerun\" with the title after realizing he may not have many games left in him, so he went all out. That includes adopting Capcom's…",

Dubbed Frozen Heath, this update adds new forms, challenges, and a fresh region to explore.\nFrozen Hearth takes place in an underground region that hosts The Tempering, a series of trials consisting of combat challenges and puzzles. Overcoming this contest rewards two new forms: the Killer Bee and the Mechanic, which can be used in the main game. \n\n\nOn September 13 you can buy the Frozen Hearth expansion separately for $4.99 or pick up it alongside the main game in a bundle for $27.99.  \nNobody Saved the World launched in January and became one of our early favorites of 2022. Former editor John Carson scored the game an 8.25 out of 10, writing in his review that, \n“Despite its minor shortcomings, Nobody Saves the World kept me enthralled from start to finish as I leveled my way through form ranks for the next body or ability to work with. It's most fun when unleashing devious yet approachable combat scenarios, keeping me on my toes to find the best solution to survive. Thankfully, it gave me plenty of those unrelenting loops throughout, justifying the time to save this funny little world.”",

Set during the Three Kingdoms era of China, you'll battle invading demons as a soldier using a blend of graceful swordplay and Chinese martial arts based on the Five Phases philosophy. The trailer shows off the many demonic foes awaiting your blade, including a bipedal tiger that is swiftly kicked out of the way by the protagonist. \n\n\nNext month, those attending Tokyo Game Show will be the first to play Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty via a show floor demo. Everyone else will have to wait until early 2023 to experience the game on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. It will also be available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.",

Microsoft then declared later that day that it will not be doing the same with the Xbox Series X/S. Now, Nintendo has chimed in on the matter. \nIn a statement to Eurogamer, Nintendo reiterates a quote from president Shuntaro Furukawa, made in June, in which he stated the company has \"no plans to increase the trade price of its hardware.” Furukawa made this statement during the 82nd Annual General Meeting Shareholders that month, in which he also said: \n\"While we cannot comment on pricing strategies, we currently do not have any plans to change the price of our hardware due to inflation or increased procurement costs in each country. We will determine our future pricing strategies through careful and continued deliberations.”\nAlthough the PlayStation 5's price will remain unchanged in the U.S. (for now), both versions of the console have become more expensive in Canada, Europe, the UK, Mexico, Japan, and Australia. The price hikes have already gone into effect in those regions except Japan, which occurs on September 15. \nThe only time Nintendo significantly adjusted the price of its current consoles was last fall, when it permanently reduced the cost of the standard Switch model in the UK and Europe. Nintendo has yet to do the same in the U.S. \n[Source: Eurogamer]",

Over three minutes of gameplay footage shows off the carnage you'll unleash against adversaries, both artificial and organic. \nPlayers wield melee weapons or firearms in one hand and more, shall we say, unconventional abilities in the other. That includes electrifying targets with lightning bolts, tossing them around with a telekinesis-like power, freezing foes solid with an ice blast, or using wires to hijack machines. The action-packed video shows off how players can creatively combine their arsenal to dismantle and disembowel anything standing in their way. \n\n\nAtomic Heart was first announced in 2018 and takes place in an alternative futuristic version of the Soviet Union in 1955. Robotic technology flourished post World War 2, allowing humanity to create a high-tech utopia. Unfortunately, these mechanical helpers have started rebelling against their human creators. If that wasn’t enough, killer mutants born from secret experiments have also run amok. Players control private agent P-3, who embarks on a secret mission to get to the bottom of what’s caused this seemingly perfect society to collapse and clean up this mess. \nAtomic Heart launches this fall for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

The game starts when the daughter of an American billionaire is kidnapped by a group of Vietnamese terrorists. Then, it’s up to Major Howard Toliver, ex-Marine and highly decorated Vietnam veteran, to gather a deadly team for the dangerous mission of rescuing her. He recruits six prison inmates serving life sentences for a chance at a full presidential pardon.\nKeep the body count rising to survive five territories by playing as each Soldier Boy (and Girl),\nbut beware and don’t waste a “friendly” since they provide vital survival information!\nScummVM currently supports the English release of the game (which is the only one we know about) and features more responsive controls than the original. We couldn't find a demo but there is a trailer. Please contact us if you have a demo or any other release.\nTo play the game with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build.
