It’ll work, it’ll be official, and... that’s about it. If those bland goals had been all this new port of Gleylancer had aimed for, it still would have been more than welcome as in its retro-tastic physical form the game is expensive even by import-only Mega Drive shmup standards. In many ways, even just a cheap and convenient alternative would have been a definite improvement.\nWhat we actually got is far more ambitious than that. The emulation in this unassuming package includes not only the usual raw pixel, 4:3, and stretched screen modes — with toggleable scanlines — but also multiple shadow masks, CRT gamma settings, and optional corner darkening. You can even pick from two different types of screen edge curvature as well as fine-tune the intensity of the effect. Pixels gain a slight (and again, adjustable) softness to them, getting admirably close to imitating the sort of depth you’d find on an old tube TV set. Best of all, you can see these effects applied in real-time to whatever screen the game was on when you accessed the menu, allowing you to easily tweak everything to your liking without going back and forth between the game and the settings.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The darting back and forth over a battlefield the size of a small town, the gravity-defying jumps through the air, the razing of entire cities with the flick of a thumb, the volume of someone’s yell equating to their increase in power - it’s all equal parts enrapturing melodrama and total lunacy. \r\n\n\nDemon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Hinokami Chronicles gets this. It gets that, when I am playing a 3D fighting game adapting a popular manga, I really want to inhabit the part of an incredibly wholesome anime boy, journeying across feudal Japan to cure my younger sister of her demonic sickness and smack around some otherworldly folk on the way there. Tanjiro Kamado is about as pure as anime protagonists come, and if there’s one lovable anime lad whose shoes I had to step into, it’d probably be his.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Looking for the best Ironhide loadout in Warzone? The new lever-action Shotgun probably won’t crack the meta, but it’s aesthetically killer. If you’re looking for something different now that the Gallo has been nerfed, the Ironhide is an excellent choice. With two-shot kill potential, it’s a menace up close. To maximize its strengths though, you’re going to need the best build.\r\n\nTo make Shotguns work in Warzone, you need as much range and hipfire accuracy as you can get. Target those stats with this build:\r\n\nThis may be a shotgun, but we’re still starting off with an Agency Choke and Task Force Barrel. Both attachments grant a big boost to damage range, though the Task Force comes with a hipfire penalty. That's why the SOF Target Designator is also a must on Cold War shotguns, as it provides even more of the two stats we need; hipfire accuracy and damage range. You have some options in the stock slot, but we’ve gone with No Stock here. This is the biggest mobility boost you can get on your Ironhide, which is a big help when dueling SMG users. Unfortunately, it also comes with a hipfire penatly. These unfortunate tradeoffs have really held Cold War shotguns back in the meta. If you find the hipfire spread on this build isn't tight enough, a Wire Stock boosts sprint-to-fire speed without a penalty. Finally, we’ve gone with the 7 Round Tube magazine to help take on groups of foes without a reload.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Looking for the best Grav loadout in Warzone Season 6? Warzone’s newest rifle packs a potent combination of damage and fire rate that makes for excellent time-to-kill numbers. The Grav also boasts one of the highest bullet velocities in the Assault Rifle category and is one of the only Cold War weapons with a caliber-conversion magazine. Get a handle on its beastly recoil, and the Grav has the potential to be a top-tier rifle. Here are the best ways to build it out.\r\n\nThe Grav’s excellent damage and bullet velocity make it highly effective at long-range if you can control the recoil. That’s no easy task, but this build will help:\r\n\nAs usual, you’ll want to start with an Agency Suppressor and Task Force Barrel. I’m as tired of writing that sentence as you are of reading it, but until Vanguard drops this is the long-range combo for every Cold War weapon. The pile of damage range and recoil control stats these two attachments provide are too good to pass up. You’ll want a Field Agent Grip as well for maximum recoil control. The Grav has a lot of vertical climb, so even skilled players should welcome the help. You’ll want some zoom for range as well, and the Axial Arms 3x remains the go-to. If you prefer a Royal and Kross 4x or other optic though, you’ll have no issues making a substitution. \r\n \nRead more",

And yes, I still love it. It is fun. It is so much fun. When is this formula not fun? The release version is, in several respects, an improvement on the beta. The characters do more bantering, it has cinematic cutscenes, and if you have to play with bots those bots do not spend all their time shooting into the drywall. Tick, tick, tick.\nBut in playing the full game in context, with stuff like opening cinematics and tutorialising videos all embedded in it, something else has become clear: this game is peak early-00s cheese. Not just because many of the enemies have the same texture as a fully loaded pizza.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It seems like a neat little friend, from what we can see down here in the little teaser video, but I'm wondering if there's more to this new mob than they've let on.

The one in Impostor Factory is a secluded manor deep in the woods, a crumbling temple to cleanliness with self-cleaning floors and a literal golden toilet in the bathroom. You are the first to arrive, shoulders heavy with rain. You don't know much about the hosts, apart from the fact that they're old, eccentric, and eager to unveil the mysterious machine looming in the main hall. The other guests are as rich and quirky as the villa's owners, and you, an everyday man named Quincy, are starting to feel a bit awkward about the whole situation. And yet you stay because you're curious about the machine, the weird vision you had in the bathroom, and that other guest you keep bumping into - the lady in a red dress that looks familiar and sad and full of secrets. \nThe stage is set. The guests are gathered. The murders begin. And then they happen again, and again, and again. The real mystery is not discovering who committed the murders. The mystery is understanding why they keep happening.\nRead more",

          "description": "The AMD Ryzen 7 5700G was released earlier this year for £330, but supply issues made it hard to find this processor with integrated graphics at all. Now, Ebuyer are selling the chip for £295, a £40 reduction from its recommended retail price of £330. That's a good deal for a CPU that outperforms AMD's already excellent Ryzen 3700X while also providing fast enough graphics performance for 1080p gaming. Oh, and it comes with a free, quite decent AMD Wraith CPU cooler - awesome. \nRead more",

          "description": "The first thing I did in the early access version of Book Of Travels was wander aimlessly into a dangerous forest, get robbed by a Ruffian, refuse to hand over my meager starter items because I had given myself the 'stickler' personality trait, and completely flub the resulting combat encounter because I had no weapons.\nMight And Delight's creative director Jakob Tuchten was quite apologetic about my fate, but a life is a small price for a surprise - the greatest gift to an old MMO player like me. I'm telling you this off the cuff because this is not, in fact, representative of my ten hours with Book Of Travels so far. Aside from my initial unwitting choice to spawn in a dangerous area, the Braided Shore is a serene world with a meditative pace. It's a fable in game form, with its painterly visuals and homely magic. If you are looking for danger though, it is out there waiting for you off the roads and far from city centers.\nRead more",
