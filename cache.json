Movie will be coming our way in early April (be sure to check out our release date guide for region specifics) and it certainly looks like we are in for a video game adaptation that actually respects its source material. What a concept!\nWith every new trailer and poster comes more detailed peeks at Illumination's take on The Mushroom Kingdom and all of the familiar faces that we are going to find therein. From series staples down to the more obscure characters, we have been pretty impressed by all of the silver screen tweaks and enhancements made to the appearance of the plumbers and pals. Were they really necessary, though? Are they better than what we get in the Mario games?\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Gore-trait Of Ruin.\nThe genre blend of Metroidvania and Soulslike is a tried and true combination. And it makes sense; two styles of game with a deep focus on exploration and strict difficulty were bound to cross paths. Games like Salt and Sanctuary, Blasphemous, and — of course — Hollow Knight have successfully taken what makes the genres and mashed them into a mini-genre of their own (although some would argue that Dark Souls itself is essentially a Metroidvania already). Debuting developers Mantra and Sinergia Games have thrown their own hat into the ring in the form of Elderand, which further shows why this mix works, even if this particular concoction could do with being more potent.\nYou take on the role of a nameless hunter who has washed up in a mysterious land with his crew dead and no bearings to work from. This place is filled with a litany of monsters and threats, and throughout your journey, you unravel a tense plot involving a cult, a serpent society, and a village under threat. While the story is a lot easier to follow than its FromSoftware inspirations, Elderand also tells a lot of its story through the use of item descriptions, letters found across the world, and environmental storytelling. Truth be told, the story didn’t do much for us, with a lot of it being omnipresent text flaring onto the screen. However, the worldbuilding impressed us, each of the game's areas feels cohesive, and you can really see the effects of events prior to the game beginning.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Unlike some games, Veil Of Dust doesn't make it sound like any sort of concession; the middle difficulty is called Challenge, and says \"it's pretty tough - you've been warned\". I took the warning seriously, and thank God, because even the easiest difficulty had me pouring dandelion tea down my brother's throat like he was doing a kegstand (and in the game).\nÁine and Shane are a pair of Irish siblings who've moved to Oregon to start a new life, which, in the main story, involves eating potatoes and trying not to get depressed. It's difficult enough that I didn't think I would like it at first, as even basic tasks deplete your stamina and sleeping in your 1860s hovel with a hole in the roof doesn't restore very much per night. Áine can do spells, but they're simple and only really take the edge off what is a very hard life. Magic isn't a cure-all in Veil Of Dust, and using it has to be weighed up, just like everything else.\nRead more",

          "description": "From the heady mists of 1994 once came Master Of Magic, an all-time best 4X loosely summarisable as Civilisation crossed with Master Of Orion.\nIn the... uh, semi-heady fog of 2019 came the news that it was getting a remake, and I was muchly excited, for in the interim I'd actually learned the original existed and how good and somehow unrivalled it still was. And finally, in the slight damp of late 2022, that remake arrived. It is a remarkably faithful remake, to a degree I may not ever have seen for such an old game. Some details and flourishes aside, it's basically the same design, with all the same parts.\r\n\nCoincidentally, I've also finally got into Total Warhammer lately, and spent some time reacquainting myself with Warlords Battlecry, and in between building city walls and crushing stupid aryan elfs, I've realised what truly connects all three: balance. They all, correctly, reject it.\nRead more",

          "description": "It’s the dead of night. I’m in my little tugboat out on open waters. I can barely see three feet in front of my nose because of the thick blanket of fog, but I'm trying my hand at night fishing, hoping to hook something really good. I find a squid spot and start to fish, reeling in one or two fine-looking catches. The third one, however, is monstrous, a mess of jagged teeth and sickly pale flesh. Yes, this should make for a fine amount of cash. The more morbid it is, the more money I get. Suddenly there’s a deep rumbling in the ocean and panic starts to creep in. I chuck my prize into my cargo and speed back to town, the phrase ‘fuck round, find out’ circling my brain.\nI’ve not been playing Dredge long, but I’m calling it one of my favourite games of the year, right now, in February. Black Salt Games' sinister fishing RPG is gripping and enchanting in a way I didn’t anticipate. I’ve spent hours exploring its murky waters and my constant shock at what unsettling creatures my hook brings in is seemingly never-ending. Its eldritch world keeps pulling me back with its mystery and malevolent horror, and its sense of atmosphere and tension is incredible. Basically, I'm completely enraptured, hook, line, sinker. Dredge already feels like one of this year’s greatest indie horrors and all this, from a fishing game of all things.\nRead more",

          "description": "The last thing you need when you’ve just crash-landed on an unknown planet teeming with predatory wildlife is to discover you’re also stuck in a time loop. But that’s the fate of deep-space astronaut Selene in Returnal, when she ditches her single-seater vessel on a remote rock called Atropos. Each time she falls foul of the local fauna, she pops back into existence right next to her broken ship, with no obvious means of escape. Forget Aliens vs Predator, this is Aliens vs Groundhog Day.\nBut what a day it is, as Returnal combines a best-in-class third-person shooter with a deep dive into the psychology of its protagonist. Selene’s journey into Atropos, through a thick jungle, a burning vermilion desert and beyond, sends her circling through a smorgasbord of emotions – from confusion to hope, despair to determination. And so often, her mood dovetails with your own highs and lows of elation and frustration, until every part of Returnal encases you in its loop.\nRead more",

It was one of that era's City Building series that included Zeus and all of the Caesars, a run of games so good that they earned the capital letters. Pharaoh also happens to be one of my foundational video games, and I played it when I was knee-high to my big brother's desk, at a time when family homes had one (1) yellow-grey computer with a CRT screen. And now it's back, baby.\nPharaoh: A New Era means I can play that game of my childhood on my shiny black RGB-lit bastard. Honestly though, the \"A New Era\" part is a bit much. Sure, the updated graphics are fabulous and the quality of life changes mean it plays like smooth peanut butter to the 90s' extra crunchy. It's a good remake of a solid game, but the mummy in the casket is fundamentally the same.\nRead more",

Yes, they're cheap per gigabyte, yes they're fairly reliable, yes they're absolutely the way to go if you need to store a lot of data and don't care how long it takes to access it. But. But. These drives are hard to go back to after you're used to SSDs, with their near-instant access times, completely silent operation, resistance to shocks, drops and magnets and of course their overall SPEED. \nSo when I had the chance, I bought the biggest SSD I could afford, a 4TB model at the time, and copied literally every bit of data from the four or five 1TB or smaller hard drives that I'd bought over the years and stuck into my increasingly full PC tower. It was expensive, and it took ages to copy everything across, but as soon as I turned my computer on for the first time and I didn't have to listen to the clicks and whirs of a mechanical drive, I was completely convinced I'd made the right call to ditch spinning rust.  \nRead more",

The first half teases massive potential for a cutesy story with fun puzzle antics, but the game is majorly let down by a repetitive and often frustrating second half and lacklustre ending.

It’s cringe-y and occasionally grating, but it’s also surprisingly charming and stuffed with referential humour that OW fans will surely love.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's one of those classic, age-old moments where you're suddenly walking on the ceilings and jumping over gaps upside down to further test your skill and overall dexterity. Gravity Castle, on the other hand, has seemingly made it its entire premise, making for a brilliant Next Fest demo that's still available to download on Steam right now. It also looks absolutely gorgeous, channelling Ico and the rest of Fumito Ueda's oeuvre in all the right ways. \nRead more",

          "description": "I think Wanted: Dead wants to be a singleplayer, third-person action game with kickass combat and a colourful cyberpunk universe that slides effortlessly between gritty and silly. And I'm guessing it wants players to experience the joys of shredding goons, and a story told through unpredictable cuts to karaoke and anime. I'm sad to report that it isn't any of these things. Aside from the tiniest glimpses of cool when a combo comes together, the game clearly doesn't know what it wants to be, or if it did once upon a time, its original vision must've gotten lost under a dogpile of ideas. I rooted for it when I first saw it way back when, and got excited when I heard it was being made by devs behind Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive, but what's arrived is a jumbled mess that fights you at every turn. If I were Debra Meadon playing it for the first time live on Dragon's Den, and someone sidled up behind me and pressed a katana to my throat, I would still carefully put the controller down and say, \"It's a no from me\".\nRead more",

          "description": "Magic is weird. And, since an Ordinary (non-magical person) suddenly getting magic is also deemed weird in Ikenfell, it stands to reason that it’s practically guaranteed to happen. We can only assume the odds become even higher as the Ordinary ventures closer to the big magical fantasy school, which protagonist Maritte quickly discovers. Upon approaching the gate in search of her missing sister, Safina, Maritte suddenly starts to sling fiery spells.\nThose new spells certainly come in handy, as Maritte finds herself fired up (hehe, geddit?) and ready to fight through this Paper Mario-style tactical RPG. Along with some of Saf’s old friends, you explore the titular school and surrounding areas, searching for clues that might help unravel the mystery. Ikenfell has challenging combat and lots of little secrets hidden in its 8-bit world, but it’s the loveable bunch of pals (both allies and rivals) that really made me smile. Oh, and some of them have killer theme tunes that I can’t stop singing.\nRead more",

Over the weekend, veteran game dev Brenda Romero called out the novel for excluding her from the acknowledgments, despite the similarity, confirmed by the author elsewhere, between Romero’s board game Train and an in-book video game Solution.\r\n\n \nRead more",

A hybrid of a factory layout/logistics sim, integrated into a city builder, combined with an RTS, all wrapped up in a satirical dystopia encouraging you to be the most appalling villainous hypercapitalist possible.\nAll of those parts are present, and as a bonus it's incredibly gorgeous, with strong voice acting and a distinctive soundtrack that will haunt my head for weeks. Most of its parts are made to a high standard, it's tragic that its final design just doesn't work at all.\nOf all things, IOT reminds me of Fragile Allegiance. You're a 'founder', sent to an already colonised and abandoned Titan to build a new city at the behest of the Council. You're a 'founder', sent to an already colonised and abandoned Titan to build a new city at the behest of the Council. First, by salvaging its ruined buildings for minerals and isotopes, then mining for surface deposits, all of which goes back into your building resources. Curiously, you never combine two resources to produce a third, you can only upgrade minerals through a tier system. Higher tier resources are more potent, meaning, for exmaple, a building site will accept 100 raw minerals or four higher tier units. It’s a bit strange, but it mostly works. Double clicking on your starting buildings summons an interior view, where you lay out machinery, little modules for workers and storage, power pylons and so on.\nRead more",

The original The Sims — now sometimes called The Sims 1 for the sake of clarity — was released in February 2000, and received regular updates via expansion packs through to October 2003. The game was the brainchild of Will Wright, the designer behind the SimCity series, who had decided to approach the world of his popular city-building franchise from a new angle. Switching from macro- to micro-management, Wright's new spin-off project aimed to focus on the architectural design of individual houses. As time went on, his creative interests would shift again, to also take in the lives of the people inside the buildings.\nRead more",

It's a low-poly PS1-style game where an order of witches has tasked you with retrieving a grimoire from a cursed realm of endless trees. You are largely defenceless, except for the ability to draw on the ground with salt. \"In many stories that I knew as a child, salt was one of the very powerful magical protective elements against evil spirits,\" solo dev Khamelot tells me over email. \"During invocations, drawing a circle of salt could act as a basic protection.

It's a chill, citybuilding puzzle game from the devs behind the altogether more violent Diplomacy Is Not An Option, and it's all about building tiny little villages on top of rocky outcrops. Except when you stick three of the same building type together, they all zhuup together to create an even bigger one. And a bigger one, and a bigger one. It's very satisfying. The smooshing lights up all the same parts of my brain that Threes did when I became obsessed with it about five years ago, while the tile planning hits scratches that big Dorfromantik itch, making for an excellent Steam Next Fest demo experience.  \nRead more",

February’s Game Pass picks kick off tomorrow with the online action-RPG SD Gundam Battle Alliance, and EA’s Madden NFL 23 - which corrupted a number of players’ saves last month.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Bullet hell shooters have never been one of my fortes in games. There is certainly something magical about watching masters of the genre weave effortlessly in and out of flying orbs in the likes of Gradius, R-Type and Ikaruga, but whenever I attempt to step up to the gamepad myself, my movements have always proven too flighty, too seized by panic, to make much headway with them. Enter The Knight Witch, which takes the thrill of the bullet hell shooter and wraps it up in a lovely Metroid-like-shaped package my brain can actually understand. It's a fantastic little game, and I'm only sorry we didn't cover it in more detail when it came out at the end of November last year.\nRead more",

Respawn have broken the mould a little bit with Apex Legends Revelry and the game's four year anniversary - instead of adding a new Legend as usual, they've spent their time elsewhere to bring a host of Legend meta and weapon meta changes, alongside the new Team Deathmatch game mode and improving player onboarding that we reported on earlier in the week.\nApex Legends Season 16 is going to break a surprising number of targeted adjustments to various different guns, Legends, and abilities. And all that on top of the entirely revamped Legend class system, which gives every Legend a brand new perk (or in some cases two!) to play with. Read on for a full list of all the major changes that are coming to Legends and weapons with Apex Legends Revelry.\nRead more",

Nah, never played anything quite like it! Well, that's a lie.

          "description": "A small slice of Ryoma's swordplay\nLike a Dragon: Ishin! is not far off from launch. But if the wait's just a bit too long, there's a demo for Ishin out today so you can get a taste of the new-old combat.\nThe \"Combat Demo\" is out now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The two-part combat demo covers a roughly 20-minute section of the game, specifically spotlighting the combat of Like a Dragon: Ishin, which sees Ryoma bringing his sword, gun, and fists to bear against foes.\nThe slice of Ishin covers both a brawl at Kiyomizu temple and a face-off with some armored foes. This demo looks to spotlight not just the fighting, but what enemies are bringing to the table to try and stop Ryoma. If he's anything like his supposed descendant, though, there's not much that can.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqkDNGqWrvE\nSega and RGG Studio have also revealed a special \"Dragon of Dojima\" skin, that will make Sakamoto Ryoma look just like Kazuma Kiryu, suit and all.\nHeading back to an older era\nIshin is a remake of the earlier entry in the series, one which we never saw ported over to the west. It's historical fiction, using the likenesses of many Like a Dragon series characters, but with different names, playing figures from the time in dramatized versions of the events.\nStill, just because Kiryu is actually Ryoma, doesn't mean there isn't some classic Like a Dragon to get up to. Alongside the brawling you can see in the Ishin combat demo, there's also the usual substories and side-games you'd expect from the series. Plus, an Another Life section where Ryoma can live it up as a peaceful farmer. What's not to like about a slice of farming life inside this classically action-heavy series?\nLike a Dragon: Ishin! goes live on Feburary 17 for Deluxe Digital pre-orders, and on February 21 for every other version.\nThe post Like a Dragon: Ishin! demo lets you get a taste of battle before launch appeared first on Destructoid.",

Initially, they had planned for the game to be out the door by February or March, but now they’re predicting it could land as late as April.\nFrogwares has released a video to go along with the announcement to outline the difficulties they have been having. The developer is based out of Kyiv, Ukraine, and because of the Russian invasion targeting the country’s energy infrastructure, the team has had trouble maintaining a work schedule. The video also outlines how some members have to alternate working remotely and in office, depending on which site has power at the time.\nhttps://youtu.be/d5XiUNnjp-4\nWhile I haven’t played any of Frogwares’ Sherlock Holmes titles, I have gotten into The Sinking City, which I mostly enjoy. I’m mostly held back by the fact that I’ve never read any of the novels. Frogwares started their adventure series based off Arthur Conan Doyle’s detective stories back in 2001. Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened is a full remake of their third game, released back in 2007.

Thanks?\nKill It with Fire VR will recreate the over-the-top action of the original release, as players search a variety of locations including houses, gas stations, farms, and, of course, bathrooms for the eight-legged critters. Track down a menagerie of creepy crawlies, before engaging in mortal combat with an arsenal of household implements, ninja weapons, firearms, and other super bombastic weaponry.

          "description": "Revenge is a dish best served all the time\n34BigThings has announced that it's dropping its loose interactive adaptation of Roberto Saviano’s novel Gomorrah today. The plot seems unconnected with either the book or the 2014 Italian TV show of the same name, instead utilizing a similar crime drama approach to the narrative.\nIn Gomorrah, you take the role Nina Miniero, the daughter of a Naplese crime boss. After Nina’s 18th birthday party is attacked and her father murdered, she takes the reins of the crime family and drives it on a collision course with revenge. You lead the family through various procedurally created missions, making each playthrough different. There are eight possible endings that you’ll reach based on your choices.\nGomorrah is presented largely as a choice-driven visual novel with visuals crafted by comic artist Luca Negri. Gameplay is largely resource management and decision-making. The team has stated that they weren’t able to work with author Roberto Saviano himself, but a screenwriter from the TV series provided some guidance.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/rRHQ_at02r4[/embed]\nI really enjoy the visual style of this game, and it sounds like an interesting experience. Something about it is giving me pause, however. I definitely don’t mind more menu-heavy gameplay, but it might just be that I’m not that big into violent crime drama. I’m familiar with neither the book nor the TV show. Still, at release, Gomorrah will run for $3, so it’s not a big investment if you want to take a peek.\nGomorrah is available today on PC, iOS, and Android.\nThe post Interactive narrative Gomorrah launches on PC and Mobile today appeared first on Destructoid.",

A full remake of the 2014 spin-off title in the Yakuza/Like a Dragon series of action-RPGS — And speaking of yesteryear, the studios announced that a special DLC skin is included in Ishin's Deluxe Edition, which sees the return of the eponymous Like a Dragon protagonist, Kazuma Kiryu!\nThe \"Dragon of Dojima\" DLC will allow players to dress Ishin's hero like his centuries-later descendant, complete with his iconic silver-grey suit and snakeskin shoes. It should be noted that this is just an aesthetic skin, Sakamoto will not literally become Kazuma — But if you fancied turning the attractive, period-piece world of Edo Japan into an absolutely dreadful anachronism, then you're sorted.\nIn this short trailer, you can see Sakamoto looking slick as he gets his ears cleaned out.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqkDNGqWrvE&ab_channel=SEGA\nLike a Dragon: Ishin! is a full remake of the 2014 PS3 release of the same name, and follows the adventures of Ryoma Sakamoto, who becomes embroiled in a local war of houses while investigating the murder of his sensei. Like a Dragon: Ishin! continues the hard-boiled drama, violent action, and a little of the tongue-in-cheek nature that is the trademark of the Like a Dragon series, but never saw the light of day outside of Japan, with Sega concerned that the game's setting and characters might not localize well enough to warrant the effort .\nOne should remember that the series then was not the highly recognized brand that it has become today, specifically since the launch of 2015's Yakuza 0, which was a huge hit on the PS4 platform.\nLike a Dragon: Ishin! launches February 21 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post Kazuma Kiryu DLC skin included in Like a Dragon: Ishin!

If you’re planning on watching the trailer, I feel I must warn you: it might make you hungry.\nCuisineer will combine the horrors of the food-service industry with the pleasures of dungeon crawling. Playing as cute-as-heck aspiring chef, Pom, you will plumb the dark recesses of the world for ingredients to serve to your customers. You’ll weaponize your utensils to take on bigger, badder bosses in an effort to build the best recipes for your discerning customers.\nI’m sorry, I’m a bit distracted here. I keep looking at the food.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/vSxgdxR1_5s[/embed]\nBeyond ingredients, dungeon diving will net you gold, items, and additional recipes. The dungeons are procedurally assembled, giving you something new each time you plumb them. As you gather wealth and renown, you’ll expand your restaurant so you can serve more customers and thereby gather even more wealth and renown.\nThis is cute. This reminds me of 2010’s Recettear in its combination of dungeon diving and business management. The gameplay loop of setting out into the world and returning to reap the rewards is an addicting one. Better yet, I’m enamored by the graphics. Not just the food, but just the bright colorfulness of its all, its chibi characters, and the pleasant-looking towns. Also, the food. I’m not hungry right now, but the way the highlights are drawn on those meals makes me want to eat and deal with the consequences later.\nCuisineer will be coming to PC in Summer, 2023.\nThe post Cuisineer is simmering for a Summer 2023 release appeared first on Destructoid.",

Each Big Shot is packed with premium polyester filling and printed on soft velvet polyester cover. Each character is available in two sizes — 22\" x 19\" or 16\" x 14\" — and weighs 1.5 lbs or 16 ounces, respectively. Either way, they're built to take a kicking, so you can practice your Shoryukens until the cows come home.\n\nOf course, fans of a certain age will no doubt be instantly reminded of the massively popular WWF Wrestling Buddies of the late '80s, which saw similar toys made of stars such as Hulk Hogan, Ultimate Warrior, Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts, and \"The Million Dollar Man\" Ted Dibiase. I personally never had one myself, but I remember them being around in abundance.\nSo, Big Shots, drop a Juri and I can finally make up for lost toy time. 42 years old.\nThe Street Fighter Big Shots are available for a limited time over on the official Big Shots website.

It's a 2D action RPG where Sylas and the player will raise a mage army and eventually lead a revolution. Digital Sun, the tema behind merchant RPG Moonlighter, is making The Mageseeker. It's set to arrive in spring 2023 for PC and console.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n66QyujLXyg\nAdditionally, the Riot Forge locked in release windows for two other projects. Song of Nunu, a character-action game from Tequila Works starring Nunu and Willump, is aiming for fall 2023. And Convergence, a single-player 2D action platformer starring time-bending champion Ekko and developed by Double Stallion Games, arrives in summer 2023.\nFanning the Forge\nRiot Forge covers the ongoing third-party efforts to expand out the world of League of Legends. Games have been steadily rolling out of it, too; we've already seen the likes of auto-runner Hextech Mayhem and the Airship Syndicate-developed RPG Ruined King.\nAll the while, Riot Games is also crafting its own dive into the world of League of Legends. The fighting game Project L sits somewhere on the horizon, and other projects lurk around. Add on the likes of Teamfight Tactics and the successful Arcane series, and it feels like League of Legends has expanded far beyond its MOBA bounds at this point.\nThat's probably a good thing, for those who dug stories like Arcane but aren't keen on playing some 5-on-5 in the Rift. We'll see what the Forge has in store as more of its projects roll out throughout 2023.\nThe post Riot reveals action RPG The Mageseeker, the latest League spin-off appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "And you get some cat ears into the bargain, too!\n110 Industries' wild, cyberpunkian adventure Wanted: Dead has been let loose upon the world, exposing its utterly merciless challenge to PC and console players everywhere. As we noted in our review, it's a rock-solid title, with precise melee action, spongey enemies, and brutally distanced checkpoints.\nThe brutal challenge of Wanted: Dead is all part and parcel of the experience, with the default difficulty of \"Normal\", an optional \"Hard\", and the reward of \"Japanese Hard\" once you complete the game for the first time. But if you and Lt. Hannah Stone are having too tough a time against the battalion of Trash Mobs thrown your way, then we're here to help, with a guide to unlocking a secret \"Easy Mode\".\nHow to unlock \"Neko-Chan Mode\"\nIf you want to make Zombie Unit's mission a little less suffocating, then get yourself to the Wanted: Dead title screen and simply tap Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Left, Right, and Right. You should hear an old-school chime, and the save icon will appear in the bottom right of the screen. And, when you next start a New Game, you'll have unlocked the \"Neko-Chan Mode\" option, which reduces the overall difficulty of the game's combat.\nAs a bonus, Hannah Stone will also don a cute pair of cat ears. And why not?\nWanted: Dead is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post How to unlock Easy Mode in Wanted: Dead appeared first on Destructoid.",

Other times, I just want to feel challenged, to feel like I accomplished something for the day. Then there are the games I play out of habit having been introduced to the franchise in my youth. But mostly, I play games to stave off boredom. Because when I'm bored, I eat, and I don't want to boredom eat anymore. So I keep my hands busy with a controller, and my eyes distracted with the colorful images of whatever game I have loaded up on my console.

For me, personally, it brought back memories of calling every single disaster down on my SimCity 2000 creations. However, Artificial Disasters is using the descriptor as a way of explaining the slowly disappearing terrain in Flooded. Don’t get too comfortable with your initial landmass because, over time, it will be washed away. The goal is to place your buildings carefully to escape the approaching waves.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/qCA1hjRS9bU[/embed]\nTied into this are some RTS and rogue-lite elements. There are campaign, quickplay, and endless modes to tackle. The campaign is story-driven, having you build arks to travel the expanding oceans to figure out what is causing them to rise. You’ll have to defend yourself from other survivors out to plunder your settlements because even when faced with the end, humans will always be eager to destroy lives.\nCity-builders is one of my favorite relaxation genres. However, Flooded looks like it’s aiming to add an element of stress with its constantly ticking countdown. Still, I always enjoy a bit of progress to give a nice framework to the constant people-pleasing. If I have one hang-up, it’s that I’m not crazy about the art style. However, Artificial Disasters is a solo developer effort, and it can be difficult for one person to cover every aspect of design. It’s definitely not a deal-breaker for me..\nFlooded hits PC on March 15, 2023. If you’d like to see if it’s your speed, a demo is available via Steam and GOG.\nThe post Reversed city-builder Flooded gushes into PC on March 15 appeared first on Destructoid.",

As far as I can tell, this first wave contains the Inkopolis Plaza first seen in the original Splatoon.

There’s a second wave that will be coming along eventually, and that includes a story campaign that involves Inkopolis Square, the Splatoon 2 hub. I’m going to assume that’s where the meat of this DLC is really going to be, but Nintendo hasn’t done a super-great job of communicating that.

While the technology is unquestionably impressive, the PSVR2 unit's exceptionally high price, ($550 USD), will most certainly make it something of a niche purchase within an already niche community. Still, how much do you want to pay for a date with Lady D? Can you put a price on what would surely be the best, and last, night of your life?\nResident Evil Village VR Mode will officially release later in 2023, available as a free download for all Resident Evil Village players.\nThe post Resident Evil Village for PSVR 2 to get a spoopy demo next week appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Feelin' Witchy\nSomebody deserves a whole stack of lollipops — PlatinumGames has proudly announced that its dazzling hack 'n' slash sequel Bayonetta 3 has smashed past one million global sales. The long-long-long awaited sequel first launched on Nintendo Switch back in October 2022.\nThe sales milestone was modestly announced on the official PlatinumGames Twitter account, and sees the popular series' second sequel become the fastest-selling title of the Bayonetta series. The adventure sees the sultry Umbra Witch take on the powerful \"Homunculi\" arsenal in an effort to prevent the very tearing of space and time itself. Over the course of the story, Bayonetta is aided by friends from alternate universes, as well as a young witch-in-training known as Viola.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RlGQM6PvHY&ab_channel=NintendoofAmerica\nAfter what seemed like an endless wait for release, Bayonetta 3 finally launched to a mixed, but mostly positive reception from critics and fans. While most everybody was pleased with the iconic and chaotic combat, as well as its seamless integration into the mise-en-scene, many fans were left a little disappointed by the story and the overall character arc for their favorite naughty spellcaster.\nThe next title in the series will be spin-off release Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and The Lost Demon. This cutesy-looking title will see the young girl who would eventually become Bayonetta embark upon one of her very first adventures, exploring the Avalon forest alongside her first demon companion, Cheshire. Bayonetta Origins will launch on Nintendo Switch on March 17.\nBayonetta 3 is available right now, exclusively on Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Bayonetta 3 smashes past one million sales appeared first on Destructoid.",

Naturally, this goes about as well as you would expect, leading to Venom joining the Midnight Suns as a playable character to battle this formidable demonic threat. \n\n\nRedemption will be available on February 23.

As horrific as the game looks, it's the soundtrack and creepy sound effects that do much of the heavy lifting in building fear and tension. To understand how the remake remixes and enhances the original game's soundscape, I picked the brains of RE4 sound designer Hiroshi Tamura and lead composer Kota Suzuki to learn how they're making the game sound as good as it plays. \nGame Informer: A goal for the Resident Evil 4 remake is to create more believable soundscapes.

Two of these titles, Song of Nunu and Convergence, had been previously announced, while the third game, The Mageseeker, makes it debut. \n\n\nThe Mageseeker is set to arrive first sometime this spring. Developed by Digital Sun, the team behind Moonlighter, it’s described as a gritty 2D action RPG. It stars Sylas and takes place in Demacia. You can find The Mageseeker on PC and unspecified consoles. \nConvergence launches this summer and was first revealed at The Game Awards in 2019. Starring Ekko, it’s a 2D action-platforming adventure by Double Stallion that features parkour and time-manipulation mechanics. Convergence launches for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam and Epic. \nSong of Nunu closes out the year. Releasing this fall, it centers on the young Nunu and his yeti partner Willump on a search to find Nunu’s mother. The charming adventure game focuses on the pair working together to solve environmental puzzles. Song of Nunu comes from the folks at Tequila Works, the developer of titles such as Rime and Gylt, and it will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam and Epic. \nRiot released its first League of Legends spin-off Ruined King in 2021 to generally positive reviews, so we're curious to see how these other projects fair and if they'll attract new, non-MOBA fans coming off Netflix's well-received Arcane series. Which League of Legends title are you most interested in?

Movie to the next level by launching a website and commercial promoting the brothers’ New York City plumbing business, and it's actually pretty cool. \nYou can visit the website here, which features a commercial promoting the Mario Bros. business. Older fans will likely recognize the catchy jingle as the theme song of the 1989 Super Mario Brothers Super Show, which is a nice homage. \n\n\nThe website also features humorous testimonials, job opportunities, and even a working phone number. Calling this number (929-55-MARIO) plays a recorded message by the Charlie Day-voiced Luigi, which provides a nice sample of his performance as the green-glad sidekick. Texting the number returns a message, which, depending on when you sent it, may return a digital poster for the movie.

I liked what I saw in the initial trailer, sure, but what I found especially intriguing was that most of the game happens through a first-person view of someone driving an old station wagon through a beautiful but distraught Pacific Northwest forest. Rarely do driving games force a first-person view, and even fewer deviate from being a racer. \nPacific Drive does both, and after viewing roughly 30 minutes of gameplay during a virtual preview, I’m even more intrigued.

During today's Nintendo Direct, we got a new look at gameplay, plus the announcement of the Collector's Edition and a new Amiibo figure starring Link. However, we also got some unfortunate news surrounding the upcoming launch of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.\nIn its press release for the Nintendo Direct, Nintendo announced that the upcoming Zelda entry will retail for $69.99. This makes Nintendo the latest major publish to test the waters of raising the price of its triple-A titles in recent years. This follows other major publishers like 2K Games and PlayStation, who started pricing their major releases at $70 with the start of the new console generation in 2020. Last year, both Xbox and Ubisoft announced that their triple-A games would cost $70 going forward.\nWe reached out to Nintendo for comment regarding the reasoning for the price increase and if this will be the trend for its triple-A releases going forward, but did not immediately receive a response.

This Collector's Edition will launch alongside The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and retails for $130.\n\nAdditionally, we learned about a new Amiibo figure coming out alongside Tears of the Kingdom. This Amiibo features Link and will grant access to materials and weapons when you scan it with Tears of the Kingdom. Players will also get a special fabric for Link's paraglider.\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom arrives for Switch on May 12.",

There's no release date for the patch, nor does the message elaborate on the specifics of these improvements. \n“We are committed to making Forspoken the most enjoyable experience possible, and will provide an update about the timing of the next patch as soon as possible,” says Aramaki in the statement, which you can read in full below (click the image to enlarge). \nForspoken earned a 7.5 out of 10 review score from Game Informer, with editor Kyle Hilliard writing, “Forspoken's story and combat fail to reach the heights of its movement and exploration, but thankfully those two latter elements make up most of the experience. I sprinted, often literally, through the campaign in about 15 hours, and now I have a large world filled with nooks and crannies I'm eager to run through and explore. The narrative won’t linger with me, and I avoided combat in the open world often, but I loved making Frey leap and fly through Athia to discover all its treasure chests and secrets.” Check out our full review here.",

          "description": "To many, Cities: Skylines is the premier city-building simulation. When the PC launched in 2015, it quickly became a fan-favorite release for those who felt let down by modern SimCity titles. When the sim title arrived on consoles two years later, the less-intuitive controls didn't detract too much from the experience, enabling it to still deliver a terrific city-building experience. Now, developer Colossal Order and publisher Paradox Interview have announced Cities: Skylines Remastered, which improves the experience for console players in myriad ways.\nThis new version of Cities: Skylines aims to let players create bigger and better metropolises than ever before. In addition to the obvious graphical and performance upgrades enabled by the newer hardware, players can take their city-planning skills to the next level with up to 25 buildable tiles instead the 9 on PS4 and Xbox One versions. Additionally, players can look forward to a quick-selection tool, user-experience improvements like precision placements and updated snapping options, a new environmental control panel, a map editor, and the ability to place structures freely.\nPerhaps most importantly, anyone who owns the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One version and its DLC will receive Cities: Skylines Remastered and DLC (up to the Airports expansion) for free on their respective console family. Those who don't already own the last-gen console version can grab Cities: Skylines Remastered for $40.\nYou can see a very brief teaser rattling off some of the improvements the team made for this new version below.\n\n\nCities: Skylines Remastered arrives on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on February 15. The remastered versions of the DLC will become available in the coming months. For more on Cities: Skylines, read our 2015 review of the PC version here and the 2017 console version here. You can also read our 2021 interview with the CEO of Colossal Order on the enduring success of Cities: Skylines here.",

After just a few days with the game, I’m not ready to pass along a final verdict. But the roughly 18 hours I have played are helping to create a clear picture.\nIn that time, my most notable impression is that the developers have captured what is distinct and memorable about this fiction. Set many decades before the Harry Potter stories that unfolded in book and film, the game has a latitude to tell its own story with its own characters that is refreshing – even if there are a healthy smattering of familiar last names like Weasley and Black that are in the mix.

Those who haven’t been keeping up can sample the finished version by downloading a free demo today.\nDarkest Dungeon II arrives on PC on May 8. The game first entered early access in 2021 and, like the original, tasks players with taking a dozen heroes through dangerous dungeons. This time though, you’re guiding them on a treacherous caravan ride through five dangerous regions.\nHeroes can bond with or sour on each other via the Affinity System to create combat synergies or dysfunctions. Darkest Dungeon II also boasts a plethora of new upgrades and boons to bolster party members. The demo gives players access to the four starting heroes and two full regions to explore, but progress will not transfer to the full game. \nYou can play Darkest Dungeon II on Steam and the Epic Game Store.

Her other credits include Netflix's Jupiter's Legacy and contributions to the scores and soundtracks of movies like The Martian, Mulan (2020), and more, as reported by Variety. The publication reports that Economou thanked \"all of the people who fought tirelessly to bring this category to existence,\" thanking them for \"acknowledging and validating the power of game music.\" \n\n\nVariety also reports that prior to this year's Grammy awards, video game scores and soundtracks were eligible in the show's score category but only earned one nomination in more than 20 years. That nomination went to Austin Wintory for his score in 2012's Journey. Wintory was nominated this year, this time for his Aliens: Fireteam Elite score, alongside Bear McCreary for Call of Duty: Vanguard, Christopher Tin for Old World, and Richard Jacques for Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy. \nEconomou's Grammy was awarded during the main show's pre-show segment, hosted by Randy Rainbow, who might have not been familiar with Assassin's Creed Valhalla, if the way he announced the game's name last night is any indication. \ncan’t stop laughing at this guy announcing the Grammy win for Assassin's Creed Valhalla pic.twitter.com/vz9bTVZFTX\nFebruary 5, 2023\nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Assassin's Creed Valhalla review and then read our impressions of its Dawn of Ragnarok expansion. \n[Source: Variety]\nWhat video game score should win at next year's Grammys show?

The teaser gave us a glimpse of Cat Mario's appearance in the film, as well as Donkey Kong's reaction. Today, Universal, Illumination, and Nintendo released the official movie poster for the Super Mario Bros. Movie.\nIn this new poster, we get a cinematic glimpse of the cast of main characters that we know of so far, including Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad, Bowser, Donkey Kong, and Kamek. Additionally, we see the opposing worlds in the apparent conflict of the film, with the darkness of Bowser's Castle contrasted by the bright and joyful Mushroom Kingdom. While nobody quite matches Donkey Kong and Toad's wide-eyed and unbridled bliss, every character on the poster is at least sporting a smirk.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie features an all-star cast, including Chris Pratt as Mario, Charlie Day as Luigi, Anya Taylor-Joy as Peach, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, Jack Black as Bowser, Seth Rogen as Donkey Kong, and Fred Armisen as Cranky Kong. We also know that Mario's video game voice actor, Charles Martinet, will have a cameo in the film at some point.\nTo this point, the movie has only received character-focused posters on top of a teaser poster that preceded the initial movie trailer. If you missed out on those posters, you can see every other character and teaser poster released for The Super Mario Bros. Movie below.\n\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie arrives in theaters on April 7.

          "description": "A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.6.1. It's time to prepare for a new release!\nOur lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:\nSoldier Boyz\nGLK Scott Adams Interactive Fiction games (C64 and ZX Spectrum)\nGLK Scott Adams adventures 1-12 (TI99/4A format)\nObsidian\nPink Panther: Passport to Peril\nPink Panther: Hokus Pokus Pink\nDriller/Space Station Oblivion\nHalls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II\nBesides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list. Maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long - otherwise, there are some demos of these games available on our website.\nAnd since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen notable changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.\nAs usual, we are not just adding support for new games. We are constantly working on improving the engines we already support and, in particular, we’ve seen some incredible work being done on the SCUMM engine. Yes, there are the usual bug fixes, but this time we are also adding a feature that helps playing the SCUMM games in a truly original fashion: Support for the original loading and saving dialogs within the GUI!\nSpeaking of truly original: Remember those old CRT displays we had back in the day? With ScummVM 2.7.0 you’ll be able to replicate this experience on certain platforms thanks to our new shader-based scalers. Go ahead and give it a try!\nAll testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.\nA detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.\nThank you very much for your support! Let’s make ScummVM 2.7.0 a great release - together!\n>",

Depending on your perspective, we’re either two months early for our usual April 1st release, or a bit tardy for the Christmas 2022 release we intended. We think the wait has been worth it. This is one of the largest releases we’ve done in several years, with numerous features and improvements covering the user interface, gameplay features, and modding extensions for NewGRF and Game Script creators. Some of the highlights are: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. This includes better automatic scaling when using HiDPI or mixed DPI setups. Direct access to NewGRF/AI/GS settings from the new game window. Various small tweaks and improvements to several windows. NewGRFs can now provide engine variants that are shown hierarchically in the purchase list. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. Custom league tables for GameScripts. More natural rivers which get wider as they flow downstream. And much more, which can be seen in the changelog or the previous release announcements! In addition to these features and improvements, we’ve fixed lots of bugs. (If you played with the RC2 testing release, most were fixed before then. See the changelog for full details.)
