In the memo, CEO Tim Sweeney stated “For a while now, we’ve been spending way more money than we earn. I had long been optimistic that we could power through this transition without layoffs, but in retrospect, I see this was unrealistic.”\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "New exhibit opened today with exclusive merchandise.\nToday marks the opening day of the Pokémon X Van Gogh Museum collaboration in Amsterdam. The event brings Pokémon-inspired interpretations of some of Van Gogh's most famous works to the museum floor and there is some exclusive merchandise to pick up too — the latter of which has apparently brought out droves of scalpers to the venue's gift shop, keen to grab as much of the exclusive collaboration as possible while stocks last.\nVideos shared to Twitter by @monkeloidtv and pokeboy26 (via @Jorden1506) appear to show the shop's interior flooded by crowds of people after the collaboration prints, plushies, and cards. It is worth pointing out that while the video caption explicitly refers to those being filmed as \"scalpers\", we can't say for certain that all those in attendance were after a profitable resale. Either way, the crowded scene is really rather shocking. Note. The second video features an f-bomb at the very end — skip that one if you'd prefer not to hear it.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Following closely is, of course, Pikmin 4 with a further 22,894 copies sold. There's not a lot between the two, which potentially suggests that many will have opted for a digital copy of Pikmin 1+2 earlier in the year.\nElsewhere, the rather brilliant Lies of P has made its debut on the PS5 with a total of 9,493 copies sold to come in at number three.

          "description": "Oh my Dog.\nThe '90s was a decade-long blitz of out-there marketing campaigns, lads mags, and PlayStation; rich experimentation with the polygon and a concerted effort to push the boundaries of bad taste. Rise of The Triad, based on a modified version of ID’s Wolfenstein engine, was initially pitched as a sequel before becoming a standalone PC title in 1995. Developed by Apogee Software (which became 3D Realms), this 'Ludicrous Edition' is handled by Nightdive Studios, who has a solid track record in remastering classic PC titles.\nRise of the Triad follows H.U.N.T, a crack UN covert team tasked with infiltrating San Nicolas Island to stop a strange, Nazi-esque cult from launching nukes at Los Angeles. While your team, a band of operatives with different properties in speed, firepower, and strength, are typically fashioned, the game itself is a bizarre, otherworldly romp through maze-like stages littered with the dark and bizarre, abstract and insane, peppered with occult motifs and oddly futuristic apparatus.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

This was the internet as I remembered it, goddamnit, and the fact it mixed in a compelling corporate conspiracy story in between its pages was just the icing on an already fine cake (in GIF form, naturally, with a MIDI tune of Vivaldi's Four Seasons blaring out from your internet browser for good measure). But in revisiting Hypnospace for this month's RPS Game Club, there was one page in particular that really brought the rose-tinted shutters down on me. It was beautiful, lovely April, Hypnospace's virtual pet hamster, who can live, snooze and poop on your desktop, and maybe turn a slightly sickly shade of green if you don't pay enough attention to her.  \nAs with most things in Hypnospace, I can only assume that April and her fellow gaggle of virtual pet friends are riffs on real-life virtual pet games Catz and Dogz from the late 90s, which, yes, as a ten-year-old girl at the time, I was absolutely obsessed with. Developed by the now defunct PF Magic, Catz and Dogz 3 were arguably two of my most formative PC games growing up, and cor, I miss those dumb beasts so very much.\nRead more",

Do I need to call Mintrocket's parents and ask for an intervention?\r\n\n\r\nThing is, if you take a step back from each game they're actually very similar. Both are fundamentally about scouring dangerous places for resources and ferrying them back to a safe area where you can sell them off. Both pit you, a mediocre human, against strange and unearthly creatures. Both are sort of about redeeming scenario concepts we all hate - in Dave the Diver's case, the water level, and in Nakwon's case, the stealth mission. See, this is practically a remake!

I've recently gotten well into the modular city sets, to the extent that I look up discontinued sets on eBay and other such secondhand vendors. I don't actually get sets very often, but last week I built a police station, which can slot next to the bookshop I got for my last birthday. And while the bookshop has cute details - like a book called Moby Brick with a white block leaping from the sea on the cover, and an attic flat with a pet iguana in a glass tank - the copshop has some secret secrets that are the Lego equivalent of leaving a skeleton in a toilet stall.

          "description": "On the latest-but-one revision of their About page, Metacritic describe the process of calculating a videogame's aggregate \"Metascore\" as a kind of \"magic\". The FAQ cheekily invites you to \"peek behind the curtain\", evoking the figure of the theatre conjurer beckoning the audience on-stage to inspect the props, before performing the trick. You're only shown so much, however. There are tables for conversions between different review scoring systems, demonstrating how a B- becomes 67/100, but the \"weighting\" Metacritic gives to each source publication when producing the combined Metascore is a closely-guarded mystery.\nYou could argue that the secrecy is necessary to avoid heavily weighted publications being targeted and pestered by fans to deliver positive reviews of forthcoming games, so as to swing the average (though in practice, Metascore soothsayers have long since sussed out which outlets have the most votes). But I think it's better understood as a mixture of basic trademark protection and a mechanism of enchantment, a means of both deterring imitators and keeping avid readers guessing about the output. After all, no professional magician seriously wants to give away how the trick is performed, much as no meat magnate wants to show you the inside of a sausage factory.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's Final Fantasy: Polly Pocket Edition, sort of. Play breaks down into missions with turn-based battles and brief narrative sequences. The idea is that you can pack in a few minutes of Cloud gaming (no, not that kind) while waiting for your tube. But how will that formula square up on PC, and what to make of the game's reportedly very aggressive microtransaction pop-ups?

          "description": "El Paso, Elsewhere feels like the cancelled shooter PS2 adaptation of an incredibly short-lived Image Comics horror series from the mid-90s, leaked by a disgruntled developer over Google Drive more than a decade after the fact. It’s something that would have had a six episode animated series, broadcast out of order at 1am. It’s a testament to that moment in pop culture where the coolest thing imaginable was a tortured guy in a trenchcoat, holding a gun in each hand and fighting monsters. Whether you regard this aesthetic with respect or disgust will help you determine whether there’s anything here for you.\nRead more",

The chaos continues this week, as developer Starbreeze have now elected to take the game wholly offline for several hours at a time across Tuesday 26th and Friday 28th September, while exploring ways to minimise the game's reliance on internet access. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Scandalously, we don't appear to have covered this indie sci-fi FPS on these golden pages, so here's a quick overview: you're the high-jumping, sword-wielding, bullet-pumping lovechild of Deus Ex and DOOM, galloping through a world that recalls the Imperial bases and sewers of Dark Forces, taking down grungy pixelart sprites by means of precision parries, grabs, combos, headshots, terrain traps and much more besides. Between dust-ups, you can play basketball and leave crayon graffiti for other players care of a Dark Souls-style messaging system. It's a feast!\r\n\n\r\nThe game was due to launch into Steam early access tomorrow, 27th September, but unfortunately, there's been a delay. Valve's testers have denied Fortune's Run approval to launch on the platform. Among the reasons, according to developer Team Fortune themselves, is that Valve don't feel the game's content warning for sexual assault is actually necessary.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Said commenters might be tickled to know that there is, in fact, a puddle in the game's Akila City that contains infinite loot: by dint of peering into it, you'll magically gain access to a nearby store's inventory. Strip the shelves, then wait a day or two, and you'll be able to do so again, forever and ever.\nOr at least, that was the case till this week's Starfield patch, a small update consisting of exactly ten bulletpoints, including one that tackles \"an issue that allowed for a vendor's full inventory to be accessible\". Boo! Time to go looking for another convenient in-game metaphor, I guess. Perhaps there's something incredibly clever you can say about all the flying cities.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "About a third of the way through Mineko's Night Market, a young boy dressed as a fish says to his octopus-chopping father, \"What? I just thought sending the local errand kid on missions was how people acquired stuff on this island.\" To many, this will simply be a comic jibe at what you, the aforementioned local errand kid, have been doing for the last eight hours or so. After moving to this rural backwater with your dad in search of a better life, you quickly realise that no one in this town ever gets off their arse to get anything done.\nInstead, it's up to you, Mineko, to fulfil every last one of their desires, whether it's collecting 50 bits of wood so they can construct a frame for their new house (before asking you for 50 bits of paper to give it some flimsy-looking walls), buying and delivering them a sports drink they could have easily got themselves from the local shop, or crafting a flower box for them because, well, they asked you to. As I said, industry isn't exactly their strong suit here, and you'd be forgiven for wondering how any of them functioned as human beings before you arrived.\nBut this line of dialogue also strikes right at the heart of what a joyless experience Mineko's Night Market is. It reveals the cold, lifeless husk beneath its lovely visuals. It's nothing but 'Me, me, me' and 'Take, take, take' in this game, and NPCs offer nothing in return except soul-crushing tedium and a long list of repetitive chores. Animal Crossing this is not, my friends, so don't be fooled. This is about as far from 'cosy' and 'cute' as you can possibly get - and that's despite it having dozens of pet-able cats.\nRead more",

On specific settings. And only on GeForce RTX graphics cards. The more expensive ones.\nHello, then, to DLSS 3.5 and its Ray Reconstruction component. Like how DLSS improves visuals and performance with AI-aided upscaling and ant-aliasing, Ray Reconstruction injects some machine learning cleverness into the rendering of ray tracing. Nvidia say Ray Reconstruction cleans up artefacts and reduces the performance impact of RT effects, and judging by how it works in Cyberpunk 2077, I’d say they’re correct – with the caveat that all its enhancements are, ultimately, modest.\nRead more",

          "description": "Dragon's Dogma was the action-RPG for people who wanted to play alone, but didn't want to feel alone. By far its most charming feature was the Pawn system, whereby you'd create an AI-controlled sidekick and hire two others, shared online by other players, to accompany you on your journey through a fantasy wilderness of tumbledown castles and goblin campfires. Pawns make dependable companions in many respects - pinning enemies for you to tag-team kill, healing or resurrecting you, opening chests you've missed, and enchanting your weapons at the outset of each skirmish. But what makes them fun to be around is that they're a bunch of massive buffoons. \r\n\n\r\nPawns talk without cease as you explore: a steady patter of idle observations about well-wrought staircases and the local fish trade, advice about the bestiary and, in the case of Pawns recruited from other players, quest tips based on time in their own worlds - all of it couched in the game's quirky faux-medieval dialect. Pawn dialogue is highly context-sensitive, and very often, nonsensical. They'll climb into fountains and complain that they're wet, and launch into pithy descriptions of monsters even as they're set on fire. It ought to be maddening, but somehow, it never is - probably because the Pawns never actually attempt to be witty like ally characters in, say, Xenoblade Chronicles. They're resolutely straight foils in a realm of lions with snakes for tails, chaotic boulder traps, unpleasantly lusty ogres, and players who push the wrong buttons and make random decisions on the fly. Well, pawns are back in Dragon's Dogma 2, which I recently played an hour of, and they're chattier than ever.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I'm really struggling.\nYou see, I'd hoped Starfield's side quests would be a bit more fun than collecting magic space rocks. But basically every side hustle I've tackled have all been the equivalents of early MMO fodder and I'm so tired of them.\nRead more",

Even among Elden Ring’s cast of bastard-hard bosses, the Goddess of Rot distinguishes herself as an ender of lives, a relentless steel tempest that has shredded the most prepared and dextrous of adventurers. She’s also been beaten, rather soundly, by a man using only his mouth.\r\n\nOr, to be more precise, a QuadStick FPS, a specialised game controller comprised of a mouth-operated joystick and several 'sip and puff' switches. It’s the favoured tool of professional streamer and Guinness World Record holder Rocky \"RockyNoHands\" Stoutenburgh, who in 2022 used it to become the first quadriplegic Elden Ring player to claim Malenia’s scalp. This was a win for a QuadStick as well: a showcase of how adaptive hardware and clever controller design could make games more accessible than ever, enabling players with disabilities to match and exceed the heroics of their able-bodied peers. And yet, there’s little sense – among disabled players, advocacy groups, or even controller manufacturers – that accessible hardware is entering its golden age. While major breakthroughs have been made, high prices and commercial concerns still carry the threat of willing, eager players being left behind.\nRead more",

With development being led by former Irrational Games co-founder Robert Fermier and Age Of Empires II lead designer Ian M Fischer, Millennia will see you attempting that classic quad of Xs across ten distinct historical ages, starting in the Stone Age before eventually ending up in a \"post-modern future\", designer Ben Friedman tells me. \nThe twist here, however, is that you've also got what C-Prompt are calling 'Variant Ages', which let you bend the timeline to your will. Some of these variants are more historical in nature, such as an Age Of Monuments where everyone's building Egyptian pyramids, Friedman explains, while others are more fantastical, with the words steampunk, alchemy and space alien invasions all mentioned in the same sentence. I had a good time with it during my demo, but the real delight was seeing my home army of Kyoto go and invade neighbouring settlement Telford, before going on to conquer Rome - as you do.

          "description": "Ellis Tucci grew up playing games like Thief, System Shock, and Deus Ex. Now she's making an immersive sim of her own. It's called Spectra, and it's set in the US in an alt-history 1972 where Soviet Union is the dominant military power after President Roosevelt was deposed in a fascist coup. You play as a Soviet agent tasked with infiltrating and fomenting revolution in a fortress city called Hiwatha.\nTucci wants Spectra to meet the criteria players will expect from an immersive sim. \"To me, the immersive sim is the platonic ideal of the video game\" she says. \"I've tried to deliver on that immersion by creating an environment that is extremely interactable and flexible in the ways it can be used.\" She explains that \"a quite frankly silly proportion of the buildings in each map are enterable and that \"you can turn off the lights, set traps, and use things like televisions, radios, or payphones as lures.\"\r\n\n\r\nIt sounds like everything immersive sim fans want. But there's one big difference between Spectra and the games that inspired it. Tucci is making it on her own. And she isn't the only indie developer working in one of the most ambitious, developmentally complex genres in the industry. Games like Shadows Of Doubt, Fallen Aces and Gloomwood are merely the steam rising from the bubbling magma chamber that is indie immersive sim development, Like the recent revival of retro shooters, the indie space is on the verge of an immersive sim eruption.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "After the closure of original developers Troika, a long-awaited sequel announcement, delays and layoffs at Hardsuit, a secret change of studio (which led to further layoffs at Hardsuit), preorder refunds and the belated reveal that a developer best known for (very good) non-combat narrative experiences would be taking the reins, the only thing I really want to hear about Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines 2 is that it’s definitely, absolutely going to reach the finish line. There are actual vampires that come back from the dead less often. But I'm piqued nonetheless by Chinese Room studio design director Alex Skidmore’s thoughts on how this Seattle-set World of Darkness action-RPG adaptation will differentiate itself from other games in the genre, and especially, how it will put its vampiric premise to use.\nRead more",

This might not sound earthshattering to anybody from outside the videogame world - what are you doing here? Run along and watch your silly non-interactive movies and TV shows - but it's quite novel for a fantasy RPG in the BioWare tradition. In my experience, at least, most RPGs only give you the build-up to a character romance, then flash-freeze the relationship post-consummation, perhaps because you've unlocked a sexy \"loyalty\" companion ability and the developers don't want to take it away from you. Baldur's Gate 3 is one of the few that thinks about how chemistry  might come and go.\r\n\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Fans of 2015's Fallout Shelter have likely wondered what's next for the series. Well, it seems only natural that Bethesda would follow up with a new iteration. And it did, but this time for the studio's other prominent RPG franchise. Today Bethesda apparently shadow-dropped The Elder Scrolls: Castles, a follow-up to Fallout Shelter, out now on Android.\n\n\nThe game seems to ape its Atompunk relative but with castles and kings instead of radiation and more radiation. You manage a cartoon-style castle you can build from the very foundation, adding rooms to expand and decorate. Workstations can be placed and occupied by loyal subjects who work to \"ensure your castle has the resources to thrive for years to come.\"\n\n\nImage via Bethesda.\n\n\nThe Elder Scrolls: Castles is now out apparently for Android only\n\n\nFans of Fallout Shelter should have plenty to like with The Elder Scrolls: Castles. You can create supply chains with neighboring kingdoms or settle issues among your people. The game description in the Google Play store suggests choice-based outcomes, good or ill. There are \"epic quests\" similar to the Exploring assignment in Fallout Shelter. Chosen heroes are sent into the wilds to fight \"classic Elder Scrolls foes.\" And to the victor go the spoils, naturally. An in-game year passes for every day in the real world, allowing you to experience multiple generations of subjects you need to train and keep content.\n\n\nImage via Bethesda.\n\n\nIn an odd twist, though, TES: Castles seems to be available to Android only. At its reveal, Fallout Shelter was temporarily exclusive to iOS devices before ending up on Android and other platforms later. We haven't heard if it's out on Apple's devices yet, but we'll provide an update if we do. \n\n\nThe Elder Scrolls: Castles is available now for free on the Google Play store.\n\nThe post The Elder Scrolls: Castles is out now, Bethesda’s Fallout Shelter follow-up appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It looks like cheating doesn’t pay, and Valve is out to prove it in Counter-Strike 2. In its first set of patch notes, Valve doesn't mince words; it's banning cheaters and penalizing parties caught benefiting from their activities.\n\n\nAs noted by IGN, Counter-Strike 2 cheaters risk more than just their own in-game freedom. Valve's update warns that when multiple people are caught cheating, players partied with them risk their own account status. The patch notes read: \n\n\n“When one or more party members get convicted of cheating and permanently banned, all their associates will be penalized with loss of Profile Rank and CS Rating\".\n\n\nIn addition to the cheater-by-association ban, the patch notes target folks hoping to piggyback their way through player rankings with higher-skilled friends. “In Premier, players with a very high established CS Rating are not allowed to party with accounts that do not have an established CS Rating.”\n\n\nIt seems this is part of Valve’s latest solution to address the lengthy history of cheating in the Counter-Strike community, though the CS2 developer doesn't really explain why or how you'll get flagged as an associate. The company implemented its first iterations of Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC) back in 2002 and tuned the system into a cheat-seeking missle over the last decade. \n\n\nThese are but some of the changes, improvements, and bug fixes found in the first wave of Counter-Strike 2 updates. Valve, in very Valve behavior, launched Counter-Strike 2 at 4:40 p.m. ET on a Wednesday, officially retiring CS:GO.\n\nThe post Valve will penalize Counter-Strike 2 cheaters and their accomplices appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Own a Nintendo Switch, but have nothing to do this weekend? Well do we have news for you. From September 28 to October 3, anyone subscribed to the Nintendo Switch Online service can take the action/adventure RPG Eastward for a spin. \n\n\nEastward, developed by Pixpil Games and published by Chucklefish, is an RPG where players must find a way to escape an underground society that is on its way towards devastation. Here’s a full synopsis of Eastward from its dedicated website:\n\n\n\n“In the near-future, society is fast hurtling down the path of destruction. An unknown, toxic presence has spread and poisoned the air. Those who could escape flocked to villages underground to start a new life, and as new generations were forged, they soon forgot all memories of the blue skies above. But for a hardworking miner and a mysterious young girl, the hope of a thriving outside world beckons…\n\n\nEscape the tyrannical clutches of subterranean society and join Eastward’s unlikely duo, Sam and John, on an exciting adventure to the land above! Travel across the world by rail to uncover the mystery of Sam’s powers, and the truth behind the deadly miasma.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA full-game trial\n\n\nAs usual with these promotions, those who purchase the game after playing this trial can carry over their progress. Additionally, the full game is discounted 50% through October 10, meaning you can nab this normally $24.99 game for $12.49. \n\n\nParticipants of the Game Trial can also acquire 100 My Nintendo Platinum Points. To earn these points, check out Missions & Rewards in the Nintendo Switch Online app on your console.\n\n\nEastward launched on September 16, 2021. In our review of the game, Eric Van Allen gave it an 8/10, saying “Eastward is something a fan of pixel art and good music, with a weakness for video game nostalgia, deserves to check out. It’s just also a journey that left me wanting a little more.”\n\nThe post Adventure game Eastward is free for Switch Online subscribers until October 3 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The release window is still penciled in for sometime in early 2024, but now a new demo offers a taste of adventure. Despite the fact that this one has curses, monsters, and other threats, there are plenty of opportunities to relax throughout. Check out some of the open-world crafting in action in the new trailer below. \n\n\n\n\nVexlands is billed as a \"cozy crafting adventure,\" but you'd be forgiven for not seeing much of that in the preview. Developer Emberheart Games is looking to strike a balance between cozy and perilous with this one. Sure, you could strike out in an attempt to explore the land and hunt for resources. You could also take some time to rest and relax in your ever-expanding homestead. Decorate your place, tame wild animals, fish, and farm if that's more to your liking.\n\n\nScreenshot via Apogee Entertainment\n\n\nAre you a cozy enough dude to cleanse the land?\n\n\nWhen you're done chilling, there's still going to be a world to save and tiles to unlock. Vexlands features procedurally generated environments with dynamic weather, and each area can unveil something either helpful or harmful. You might find artifacts hinting at the past, or precious resources for trading or crafting. Or you might run into some nasty enemies or a sudden strike of lightning. You can roll the dice yourself with the demo, which is live on PC via Steam and Epic Games Store.

In the past, we’ve reported on the virtual reality version of the hit party game coming to Steam and Meta Quest, but now that the PSVR2 has been out for a while, it’d seem Sony is hitting the Emergency Alert button and planning a release for its headset.\n\n\nIn the PlayStation blog, Kat De Shields-Moon and Adam Kuta of Schell Games who, alongside Innersloth and Robot Teddy, represent a third of Among Us VR’s developers, confirmed the game will cost $9.99 when it launches for PSVR2. Outside of a \"coming soon\" promise, it's when Among Us VR will launch, but we do know that this version of the game arrives with two maps: The Skeld II and Polus Point.\n\n\n\n\nThe Skeld II is, of course, based on the infamous map of a similar name. Polus Point, on the other hand, is also based on the Polus map from the original game, but it “features 50% more tasks, nine new rooms with *cough* delicious hidden objects, and brand-new kill and ejection animations,” according to De Shields-Moon and Kuta. While they gave no indication of a release date, you can wishlist Among Us VR on the PlayStation Store beginning today to be notified of when that changes.\n\n\n\nThe post Among Us VR is officially headed to PlayStation VR2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Insomniac Games has announced several new accessibility options for Marvel's Spider-Man 2. Most of the support expands on systems found in previous Spider-Man games and other Insomniac titles like Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart.\n\n\nThe announcement came via the PlayStation Blog with Insomniac developers over accessibility design and UX, explaining expanded functionality and those uses. \n\n\nAlongside the difficulty settings in prior games, Spider-Man 2 also features what Insomniac calls Challenge Level Modifiers. These allow for aspects such as enemies' health, damage, and awareness to receive some finer tweaking.\n\n\nFeatures like Chase Assist alter chases to give players an advantage, such as slowing down the target's top speed. Repeated button presses from QTEs can also be changed to button taps or holds. There's even room to adjust Spider-Man 2's gameplay speeds, with options to play at 70, 50, or 30 percent of the original, real-time rates.\n\n\nAudio settings are adjustable, too, with high or low-frequency sounds having a toggle. There's even a filter for notch frequency to remove certain frequency ranges.\n\n\nOther features will make it into the game after launch. One of these is audio descriptions featuring a voice-over narrating cutscenes and QTEs. The other is a screen reader featuring audio descriptions for elements like tutorials or menus. Those two are especially helpful for blind players but are not coming on launch. Instead, they are a part of an update coming in December 2023.\n\n\nIncreased accessibility in games is always a great thing to hear. It helps expand a game's potential audience who otherwise might have trouble with certain elements. Hopefully, Insomniac's accessibility support works as intended to make playing Marvel's Spider-Man 2 as comfortable as possible when it releases October 20 for PS5. \n\nThe post Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 expands accessibility support with level modifiers, screen readers, and more appeared first on Destructoid.",

Not only is the spritely pink hedgehog playable in the upcoming Sonic Superstars, but she co-stars in the biggest Sonic Frontiers update, out today on all platforms. She struts her stuff in the Sonic Frontiers: The Final Horizon update trailer, along with Tails, Knuckles, and Sonic.\n\n\nAmy brings some new tools to the combat trade in the update. She's paired with her iconic hammer, but she also wields a set of cards to liven up the action. Not content with using them to attack enemies, she can also swirl them around like helicopter blades to give her more jump distance. Amy can also gain some intense speed by turning them into an exercise wheel of sorts — oddly appropriate for a hedgehog.\n\n\n\n\nAmy, Tails, and Knuckles return to give a hand in Sonic Frontiers: The Final Horizon update trailer\n\n\nOf course, we also have Tails and Knuckles. The latter brings his fists to the fight, while Tails returns rocking the Tornado 2 mech. I don't recall seeing that thing since Sonic Adventure 2. In Sonic Frontiers, the transformer plane looks like an optional summon. Tails can use it to fly around in the world, but we don't see how it fares in combat. \n\n\nImage via Sega.\n\n\nSonic Frontiers: The Final Update trailer offers a glimpse of what it's bringing to the table.

          "description": "A while ago, we were given some hints as to what to expect in Stardew Valley's 1.6 update. Now, Eric \"ConcernedApe\" Barone has given us a sneak peek of what's actually coming to one of the best indie games ever made.\n\n\nIn a recent post on Twitter, the developer outlined a number of things coming to Stardew Valley. For starters, there's going to be a new \"major festival\" as well as some \"mini festivals\" as well.\n\n\n\n\nThere's also going to be more than 100 lines of new dialogue, a new farm type, winter outfits for villagers, and support for eight people playing multiplayer (on PC, at least). That's not everything either, as the post also says to expect \"new secrets and more.\"\n\n\nWhen's the update coming?\n\n\nBarone has made it quite clear in that past that they don't want to rush the new Stardew Valley update. This is no exception, as the tweet says there's no release date yet and things are \"still in development.\"\n\n\nHowever, a post on Steam echoing the sneak peek states that version 1.6 is \"close to being finished,\" but testing, polishing, and translations need to be complete before it's ready.\n\n\nAlongside this, Barone is also working on a new project called Haunted Chocolatier. We still don't know much about this upcoming game, but it appears to feature a similar aesthetic to Stardew Valley.\n\n\nFor now, keep an eye out for update 1.6. We can only hope it'll be rolling out soon, but the developer has (rightly) said that it will release when it's ready and not a moment before.\n\nThe post Here’s a sneak peek at what’s coming to Stardew Valley in update 1.6 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Fortnite maker says it has no plans for further cuts and cites slimmer margins from its shared revenue as part of the decision. \n\n\nThe report first came from Bloomberg News reporter Jason Schreier, who said Epic Games would lay off employees. Bloomberg's source said the announcement came from Epic Games through an internal memo. Schreier's follow-up post stated Epic cut Slack access to affected employees ahead of the news breaking internally. \n\n\nEpic Games has since confirmed its sweeping layoffs.

          "description": "Cyberpunk 2077 has been on a lot of people's minds lately. The recent release of the Phantom Liberty DLC and the big 2.0 update has brought the game back into the fore (not that it ever truly left). However, it looks as though CD Projekt Red is ready to move onto something else.\n\n\nIn a recent interview with PC Gamer, director Gabe Amatangelo said both the DLC and 2.0 patch represent the \"last big updates\" for Cyberpunk 2077. While the studio will still do \"a little something more,\" the team won't be bringing massive overhauls to it going forward.\n\n\n\n\nInstead, CDPR is looking to move onto the follow-up. In the interview, Amatangelo says the developer's next project will be \"Cyberpunk 2. Or 'Orion,' I should say, whatever we end up naming it.\"\n\n\nNot abandoned entirely\n\n\nIt does look like CDPR won't abandon Cyberpunk 2077 just yet. There will likely be hotfixes and smaller updates in the future. However, it seems the company is now interested in new projects.\n\n\nIt's going to be a busy time for the Polish studio over the next few years. As well as a follow-up to Cyberpunk, we're also getting new entries in the Witcher series, as well as an official remake of the first Witcher game.\n\n\nThe recent updates have definitely been a boon for CD Projekt Red's dystopian RPG. At the time of writing, Cyberpunk 2077 is the second-best selling game on Steam. Phantom Liberty is the third-best. The only thing beating them is the recently released Counter-Strike 2.\n\nThe post Cyberpunk 2077’s DLC and 2.0 patch are “the last big updates” for the game appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Hyenas was the next release from the British studio Creative Assembly. Unfortunately, it's recently been confirmed by publisher Sega that the project – along with some others – has ceased development.\n\n\nThe company made the announcement (translated by Sega Sammy) saying that the \"business environment surrounding the Consumer area has been rapidly changing.\" The message goes on to cite the effects of COVID-19 as part of the reason for Sega having to \"implement structural reforms aimed at increasing efficiency.\"\n\n\n\n\nThis means that Hyenas has officially been cancelled in response to \"lower profitability\" in Europe, as have some other \"unannounced titles.\" At the time of writing, Creative Assembly has not made a statement about these events. In fact, the game's Steam page still says it's \"coming soon.\"\n\n\nA slap in the face for fans\n\n\nWhat's worse is the game had just had its closed beta. The last post on the official Hyenas Twitter page thanked fans for their support, adding that the team was figuring out \"where we go next.\"\n\n\nAlthough better known for the Total War series, Creative Assembly moved away from historical strategy to bring us Alien: Isolation in 2014. This was not only a terrifying and beautiful love letter to Ridley Scott's iconic 1979 film, but an example of how the Alien franchise could successfully translate to video games.\n\n\nHyenas was going to be a \"hero-based, multiplayer extraction shooter\" that pitted you against others in a sci-fi world containing \"epic zero-G combat.\" Sadly, that'll never come to fruition. Fans who played and enjoyed the recent closed beta will no doubt be saddened by the news.\n\nThe post Hyenas, the sci-fi FPS from Alien: Isolation dev, has been cancelled appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "MINTROCKET, the developer behind Dave the Diver, has announced their next title, which might not be what you’d expect. NAKWON: LAST PARADISE, according to the developer, is “an ambitious zombie apocalypse stealth-survival game, set in Seoul, in which players must use their wits to avoid detection, loot items, and escape to survive.” The game is a 16-player PvPvE experience and will be available on PC.\n\n\n\n\nIn this multiplayer survival experience, players will take on the role of survivors while the zombies will be controlled by the game’s AI. Like with other games set in a post-apocalypse, the zombies can be lured from their route or position by making sounds. If the undead enemies see you, they’ll chase after you, so be wary of how and where you’re moving about the environment. \n\n\nAlso like in other zombie-related media, “human beings are the last ones you can trust,” and you must be okay with taking what you need from other players, regardless of what that means for them, according to the game's page on Steam.\n\n\n\"We wanted to make a real survival game where you have to hide, run away, eat, and survive in a world where Zombies hunt Humans, rather than the other way around,\" said director Jang Kyoung Han. \"The game's development started less than a year ago, but getting community feedback is going to be very important to us, and so we’d like to start sharing information early and openly.”\n\n\nNAKWON: LAST PARADISE is listed on Steam as ‘coming soon,’ and no other information on a potential release date has been made public. MINTROCKET has created a server on Discord for any prospective players to discuss the game and its updates. The developer plans to host a pre-alpha later in 2023.\n\nThe post NAKWON: LAST PARADISE, a zombie survival game, coming from Dave the Diver team appeared first on Destructoid.",

But, as the saying goes, the idea was just crazy enough for it to work, as there have been times where Tetris 99 is the only reason I have a Switch.\n\n\nIn the time since this revolutionary way of playing Tetris was released and today, it’s been made clear that Nintendo wants to turn ‘99’-type games into a genre. We’ve had the short lived Super Mario Bros. 35 that, while technically not a ‘99’-type game, plays the exact same way as if it were; Pac-Man 99, a chaotic twist on the classic game; and now we have F-ZERO 99, leading the younger generations to ask ‘what’s F-ZERO’?\n\n\nIn any case, the question of the day is: what’s next?

The Meta Quest 3, which boasts a graphic processing power that’s doubled when compared with the Quest 2, has been revealed and pre-orders have been opened for its launch date on October 10.\n\n\nHere’s the thing: its cheapest model, which has 128GB of storage capacity will set you back $499.99. If you want or need more storage, you can nab a secondary version with 512GB for $649.99. It probably isn’t a hugely controversial thing to say that’s a lot to ask of your average gamer. So, let’s look at what all you get for that price, and let you be the judge on if it’s worth it or not.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Meta, the Quest 3 features a 4K+ Infinite Display, which represents a nearly 30% increase in resolution quality when compared with the previous generation. It is approximately 40% slimmer thanks to their “next-gen pancake lens optical stack,” the Quest 3 has been redesigned with comfort in mind, and there is a 40% increase in audio range over the last model.\n\n\nThe cost does put it about equal with Sony's headset in the PlayStation VR 2, which launched at $549.99. But the higher price point seems to indicate that the water-level for the latest in VR tech has risen a bit, over the years.\n\n\nThat being said, lest you identify as a cutting edge early tech adopter, you may choose to stick with the Meta Quest 2, which is not only significantly cheaper, but has several years of support behind it. The Quest 2 starts at $299.99 for the 128GB model, and you can get the 256GB model for $349.99. I guess it could be worse — the Meta Quest Pro starts at $999.99.\n\nThe post Meta Quest 3 officially revealed, starting at a $500 price tag appeared first on Destructoid.",

Fans eager to feast their eyeballs on this Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon-inspired, Suicide Squad-adjacent crossover series starring characters from a variety of Ubisoft games can do so when it drops on October 19.\n\n\n\n\nIn the trailer, we are shown a neon-drenched city, a news broadcast starring Rayman — wait, Ubisoft actually remembers him? — and a main character with a bomb in his brain. Captain Dolph Laserhawk is a super-soldier locked away in the maximum-security prison known as Supermaxx. He’s then tasked with leading a team of assorted characters on highly dangerous missions. See what I mean? Suicide Squad-adjacent.\n\n\nThe voice cast was also announced, giving us not only a glimpse into how these characters will sound, but we are also given an idea of what to expect from characters not shown in the trailer. Nathaniel Curtis and Boris Hiestand will be giving life to Laserhawk and his boyfriend Alex Taylor. Mark Ebulue will play Marus Holloway from Watch Dogs 2, “Balak,” who serves as the creative director at animation studio Bobbypills, will be providing the voice for Bullfrog, series creator Adi Shankar will be playing Red from the Niji Six (a not-so-subtle reference to Rainbow Six), and Caroline Ford will be The Warden.\n\n\nIt’s also been confirmed that David Menkin is providing the voice for Rayman, Courtney Mae-Briggs and Glenn Wrage will be portraying Jade and Pey’j from Beyond Good & Evil, and Daniel York Loh will be Pagan Min from Far Cry 4. In any case, based on the series’ trailer, it would seem we’re in for a fast-paced, multiversal narrative from Ubisoft when Captain Laserhawk drops on Netflix on October 19.\n\nThe post Mash-up animated series Captain Laserhawk premieres in October appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Just a couple of weeks ago General Manager of Diablo Rod Fergusson revealed that the team had two streams worth of new stuff for the upcoming Season 2, Season of Blood. Now, we know the exact dates of those two streams. Blizzard revealed today that the first stream will take place on October 4 at 11 a.m. PDT. \n\n\nThis first stream will unveil the vampiric scourge that is front and center with the new Season 2 theme, Season of Blood. Alongside going over the new seasonal content, this stream will also detail the many quality-of-life updates coming to Diablo 4 throughout Season 2. Confirmed features to be discussed are Stash Tab updates, functionality, improvements to dungeons, mounts, and more. The stream will end with a Q&A with players.\n\n\nThen, just six days later, the Diablo 4 team will host a Campfire Chat on October 10. The focus of this stream will be to deep dive into upcoming class balance changes. Also, we can expect to learn more about new reworks coming to several of the in-game systems.\n\n\nThose interested in watching the streams can do so via the official Diablo Twitch and YouTube channels once live.\n\n\nSeason 1 was pretty disappointing. We already know Season 2 will have some new bosses, but I don't think that alone will be enough new content to reel me back in. Hopefully, we get some promising information from the two streams that gives me a reason to play Season 2.\n\n\nDiablo 4 Season 2, Season of Blood, releases on October 17. The new season will start at the same time for players on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation.\n\nThe post Diablo 4 has two Developer Livestreams ahead of Season 2, and here are the dates appeared first on Destructoid.",

But with Rogue Trader, Owlcat Games is giving the 40K universe a slightly different treatment. And to me, they look like the right studio to do it.\n\n\nI’ve been a digital admirer of the WH40K realm for a while, thanks to the Dawn of War series. A real-time strategy game just makes sense for the world of Warhammer 40,000, as its tabletop version already inspires devotion to the little dudes you send off to battle against Orks, Necrons, and heresy. But how do you translate that to a more narrative CRPG approach?\n\n\nThe answer Owlcat Games has come up with is Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, an …",

          "description": "Those who have purchased Cuphead on Xbox or PC will get access to an exclusive (and somewhat confusingly named) \"Xbox Anniversary Update\" featuring a wealth of behind-the-scenes content including unused art, the game’s soundtrack, and concepts that never made it into the final game. The update is set to release on September 29 and is meant to celebrate Cuphead’s sixth anniversary.\n\n\n“Knowing that we wanted to give our thanks to the Xbox community that has shown us love from day 1, we really thought about the kinds of things we would want to see as fans of Cuphead,” said Studio MDHR’s Chad Moldenhauer. “The goal was to make this update feel like a real peek behind the scenes at what went into bringing the game to life, across all parts of development!”\n\n\nThis update is the first time fans will have a place to listen to the entire soundtrack, as previous releases have been more of a selection of iconic tracks. Now, the Xbox Anniversary Update will feature a whopping total of 86 music tracks by composer Kris Maddigan to listen to at will. Also, there will be a menu theme that has never been heard before to look forward to, as well.\n\n\nAt the end of the day, it would seem this update is really a celebration of Cuphead’s legacy, according to Maja Moldenhauer, studio director at Studio MDHR. “It’s not a stretch to say that without the ID@Xbox program, Cuphead would not be the game it is, or have become the success it has,” said Maja. “From their very first outreach through to today, the ID team has been in our corner all these many years with resources, advice, and support. I’ve said this before, but it bears repeating that I really believe ID@Xbox is the blueprint for how modern developer support can and should be done – a team full of genuine, passionate people who want nothing more than for the teams they work with to make the best games possible.”\n\nThe post Cuphead gets a ton of behind-the-scenes content in Xbox Anniversary update appeared first on Destructoid.",

DeNA announced plans to unleash them on mobile devices in JUMP: Assemble, a new MOBA that's due out sometime in 2024. There's no word on an English release, but so far it has its sights on release in Southeast Asia and East Asia (excluding Japan).\n\n\nEvery character confirmed for Jump: Assemble\n\n\nJUMP: Assemble aims to pit Shonen Jump characters against one another in five-on-five matches. So far eight manga series have been confirmed along with images of their leads. Series revealed include Mashle: Magic and Muscles, Jujutsu Kaisen, Naruto, One Piece, Dragon Ball, Bleach, Demon Slayer, and Undead Unluck. You can see them and their respective heroes in the announcement visual, from MASHLE's Mash Burnedead on the left to Undead Unluck's Andy on the right. \n\n\nIn between those we have Yuji Itadori, Naruto, Monkey D. Luffy, Goku, Ichigo Kurosaki, and Tanjiro Kamado. There will most certainly be plenty more where those came from. DeNA noted that more titles and characters will be added to the game in the future. \n\n\nMight as well JUMP\n\n\nBeyond games based on individual series, the worlds of Shonen Jump manga most recently collided with a whimper in 2019's JUMP FORCE. That one was another 3D arena fighter melting a bunch of disparate licenses together in one occasionally awkward art style. Not all Jump-based games have been duds, though; far from it. One of the true standouts from the past 20 years or so was Jump Ultimate Stars, a Ganbarion-developed fighter that hit Nintendo DS in 2006. \n\n\nWill this be the next Jump Ultimate Stars or will we be writing about its shutdown six months after launch? Time will tell!\n\nThe post JUMP: Assemble brings manga’s most popular heroes together for a MOBA game appeared first on Destructoid.",

We will continue to consider measures to improve profitability in European bases apart from above.

Shortly after, Netflix revealed that Hayley Atwell, whom you might recognize as Grace from this year's Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning or as Peggy Carter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, would voice Lara Croft in the series. Today, Netflix released our first look at the series, which is called Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft. \nThere's no word on when to expect the series, but Netflix says it's coming to the subscription streaming service soon. \nCheck out the Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft teaser trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see in the teaser above, this take on Lara Croft seemingly follows the recent Crystal Dynamics Tomb Raider reboot trilogy that concluded with 2018's Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Back in 2021, when Netflix announced Atwell's role in the show, it confirmed the series would take place after the events of that trilogy. Looking at this teaser, it's hard to say whether or not that's the case. But it sounds like we won't have to wait long to find out since Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft is expected to hit Netflix soon. \nIn the meantime, check out the teaser trailer for Netflix's Devil May Cry anime series released today as well.

It's painted with hues of desert orange and \"Arabian Nights\" blue skies, something intentional, according to artistic director Jean-Luc Sala. \nHaving lived in the region, Sala says he and his visual team infused many sights he remembers near the Tigris River to bring Baghdad to life.

Kamiya co-founded the Osaka, Japan-based studio in 2006 and later went on to direct games like Bayonetta and The Wonderful 101. His final day at Platinum will be October 12, according to both a statement released by the studio and Kamiya on his personal Twitter account. \nAs for why, neither Platinum's statement nor Kamiya's own tweets indicate a specific reason. Platinum thanks Kamiya for his work while stating it looks forward to seeing what he does next, while Kamiya notes that the decision to leave was not an easy one but he feels it's for the best. \nHere's Platinum's statement: \npic.twitter.com/GHiSugPF42\nSeptember 25, 2023\nAnd here's what Kamiya tweeted today about his upcoming departure: \nHowever, I feel this outcome is for the best.\nSeptember 25, 2023\nBefore co-founding Platinum in February of 2006, Kamiya worked on Capcom's Resident Evil series, helping plan the first game and directing its sequel, as well as its Devil May Cry series. He also directed the first Viewtiful Joe game, and then Okami in 2006 at Capcom's Clover Studio. Capcom closed Clover later that year but Platinum had already been somewhat founded under the name Seeds, Inc. It was later renamed Platinum Games and the rest was history. \nKamiya departs from Platinum more than 17 years after he founded it alongside Shinji Mikami, who is no longer there and departed from Tango Gameworks earlier this year, and Atsushi Inaba, who is the studio's CEO.\nWhile waiting to learn what Kamiya is up to next, read Game Informer's review of Bayonetta and then check out our thoughts on The Wonderful 101.

Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign. Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. \nAfter 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.\nJoin editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up. \nPart 1 - Surpr-iced! \nPart 2 - Bringing The Smoke\nPart 3 - Staff Meeting\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

The game is coming to Microsoft’s consoles and Windows PC early next year.\nThe RPG was first released to PlayStation consoles, Switch, and PC in February. Octopath Traveler II, like its predecessor, sees players guide eight adventurers across a sprawling adventure in an HD-2D rendered world. Though similar on the surface, the sequel has been praised for its improvements in storytelling, character development, progression, and navigation. \nIn our review, we scored Octopath Traveler II an 8.5 out of 10, with guest writer Josh Broadwell writing that “Octopath Traveler II does what an excellent sequel should. Instead of breaking new ground left and right, it improves on the original in nearly every way and feels more confident about the stories it tells.”",

This release date was revealed in a new gameplay trailer from IGN for Assassin's Creed Nexus VR, which gives us another look at the game's three protagonist assassins: Ezio from Assassin's Creed II, Connor from Assassin's Creed III, and Kassandra from Assassin's Creed Odyssey. \nIn the trailer, we get a look at how combat and parkour will work in the game. As expected, given the game is a VR exclusive title, everything happens from a first-person perspective. As Connor, players will explore 18th Century America during the American Revolution. As Ezio, players will parkour through 15th Century Italy during the Italian Renaissance, and as Kassandra, players will fight as a mercenary assassin through ancient Greece. \nCheck out the Assassin's Creed Nexus VR gameplay trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Assassin's Creed Nexus VR looks pretty much exactly as you'd expect for an Assassin's Creed game in VR. All the assassin tropes are still there, fortunately, like leaps of faith, hidden blades, parkour, and more. \nAssassin's Creed Nexus VR hits Meta Quest devices on November 16. \nWhile waiting for its release, check out this Assassin's Creed Nexus VR trailer from June and then read our preview after checking out more of the game earlier this summer. \nAre you going to check out Assassin's Creed Nexus VR in November?

Luckily, developer Larian Studios has released two major patches to the game, and while the third was set to release today, it's been delayed to tomorrow. In a post on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, the developers announced the patch would be delayed \"to ensure thorough testing.\" This is likely done to avoid the issue they ran into when they had to roll back a hotfix last month.\nWhile we know the patch has been delayed, before now we didn't have much of an idea of what that patch included. While specific bug fixes are still unknown, Larian tweeted about a new feature to expect tomorrow: the ability to change your character's appearance. This includes details like pronouns, voice actor, and specific facial features, but notably does not allow you to change your race, which could alter the story depending on your choice. \nWith Patch 3 comes the Magic Mirror, which lives in your camp and allows you to change your Tav’s appearance whenever you’d like!\npic.twitter.com/LJ6y9CZ58F\nSeptember 21, 2023\nEven though the patch plans have been derailed, Baldur's Gate 3 still launches on Mac today, so if you've been meaning to grab it on that platform, now's the chance to do so. We'd highly recommend it, and you can read about why in our glowing review of the game. If you've been playing the game and enjoying it, maybe it's a sign you should try D&D, the game it's based on, as well.",

          "description": "In an announcement I personally never could have predicted, the 2001 PlayStation 2 Capcom video game Onimusha: Warlords (and subsequent sequels) is getting an anime adaption for Netflix. The reveal is surprising for a number of reasons. The franchise is not one that is particularly well-known or currently popular. Also, the anime seems to have little to do with the original game. Protagonist Samanosuke Akechi does not make an appearance in the trailer. But, like Samanosuke, who was modeled after Japanese actor Kaneshiro Takeshi, the anime's protagonist, Miyamoto Musashi, is modeled after the late Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune. Coincidentally, Onimusha 2's protagonist, Jubei Yagyu, was modeled after Japanese actor Yūsaku Matsuda, who had also passed away well before the game released. It's an odd throughline for the series but is a key element.\nThe other surprise for the adaptation is it is being co-directed by Takashi Miike. Miike is known for films like Ichi The Killer and Audition, but he also has another big Capcom franchise under his directorial belt with Ace Attorney, a film adaption of the Phoenix Wright games.\nI played Onimusha for the first time in earnest when it released on Switch and enjoyed revisiting it and finally beating it. You can find more of my thoughts on that topic here.\n\n\nThe anime premieres November 2 on Netflix.",

The initial Dark Side support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. Additionally, there are two playable demos if you want to test the game. Support for Amiga and AtariST will be available later! Please contact us if you have some other release.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build.
