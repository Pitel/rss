From its beautiful animation style to stunning watercolour backgrounds and hand-drawn characters and world, amidst the bustling genre of Metroidvania, it stands out in the best possible way.\nThe blend of colourful worlds and tight combat pay homage to some of the best in the genre, but it's the art style that has long stuck out to us. Afterimage smashed its 2022 Kickstarter with fans falling head over heels in love with the game's visual identity alone, and that magic has followed through to the final product. And it was one of the standout aspects in our review, where we said the game \"offers a lengthy, lovely-looking Metroidvania adventure.\"\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Of course, we're not referring to the actual act of wall jumping (heck, most platformers could be said to contain a reference in that case), but instead how the game teaches you to use the ability. Instead of a 'Double-tap A' command appearing on the screen, Jedi: Survivor sees Cal Kestis learning the ropes from a trio of fluffy friends.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It has Contra III’s dual weapon wielding and switching structure, the ability to fix your aim with the ZR trigger, and a double jump available right off the bat. The weapons range from homing missiles and boomerang lasers to flamethrowers and the all-eclipsing, still wildly lucrative spread gun.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

As Sakurai puts it, \"Imagine buying a banana, only to have it taste like an apple\".

Participants had 48 hours to throw together a game, and Sébastien Benard—known for working on Dead Cells—decided to give it a shot by making a firefighting game called Nuclear Blaze. After the competition was over, Benard wanted to expand on the idea and give it a proper release, which led to the Nuclear Blaze that we have today. Though it still feels a little simplistic, this is a great bite-sized take on the action-platforming genre.\nNuclear Blaze places you in the role of a firefighter deployed with your crew to put out a wildfire that’s gotten out of control. After putting out the worst of it, you stumble upon a secret research black site in the forest which is also on fire and go inside to investigate before getting trapped within and cut off from communication with your team. Left with no other choice, you delve deeper into the facility to put out the fires you can and to collect dossiers that can tell you more about what happened to the numerous dead researchers there.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It does seem like a marriage that was destined to happen.” It was a marriage that would produce a famously strange child in Jurassic Park: Trespasser.\r\n\n \nRead more",

When you and your squad head back to your Abbey HQ, there are side stories and quests to investigate around the Abbey grounds, items to find, and more. It's a sizable part of the game, but at one point it was even bigger, creative director Jake Solomon tells me at GDC. \n\"It's crazy, if you go online, you can see all the Midnight Suns cutscenes and they're three hours long. That's as long as a movie,\" he says. But during the last year of development Solomon reveals \"we cut 30 conversations from the game, like 30 scenes. We cut a ton, because we realised this is just simply too much.\"\nRead more",

I was all about the chocolate. Sure, I’d crack open the yellow canister inside, let out some variation of, “Oh, an elephant!”, and promptly toss it in the bin and walk away, its destiny consigned to landfill. In the landfill of my brain, I’m currently carving out new space for Street Fighter 6’s World Tour mode. It's available to try now in demo form on PC and consoles, but I've been able to play a larger build of it that covered the first two chapters. Sadly, I can't say it left much of impression.\nIn case you're equally bemused by what SF6's World Tour actually is, this is a new, open world, RPG-style mode in which you make a custom fighter, run around small areas of Metro City and other locations around the globe, and level up. There are moves to learn, side quests to complete, and you can even do mini-game activities such as making pizza. Between all of that, you fight people. Other fighters, unruly gang members, random folk making their way to work in the morning. You can punch almost all of ‘em! There’s a glimpse of the Street Fighter you know and love here with its side-on 1v1 bouts, but everything else around it is unnecessary fluff. In other words, World Tour is the token toy inside the more delicious Street Fighter chocolate. \nRead more",

          "description": "Valve revealed a swathe of new features coming to Steam's desktop client beta last night, and there are lots of new features that caught my eye. They're overhauling things like the in-game overlay, creating a new toolbar to house achievements, friends chat and discussions, and creating a new hub that shows you everything that's happened in the game's community since you last played it. It also introduces a cool pin feature that lets you stick overlay windows on top of your game - handy if you're following a guide, say, and don't want to keep alt-tabbing out. But there's one thing I'm quite upset about, and that's the new Notes app. I love a good notebook game, you know? Fiddling out puzzles in Tunic, remembering patterns in The Witness... Notebook games are great. But I fear this new Notes app will kill that kind of note-taking dead. And that makes me sad. \nRead more",

It's well-known now that the delay was simply about polishing the game rather than anything more drastic, but to Solomon's credit he does also concede that he was perhaps \"a little naïve\" at the time for thinking it would go down without question.\nRead more",

Played less intensely over a longer period, I imagine more of its intricacies becoming clear, and more custom playstyles emerging to encourage more replays and challenges. As it stands though, its generally high quality and interesting systems just haven't captured my imagination.\nIt is not unimaginative, though. Some of its playable races are the usual elves and goblins, but most have a twist, like the cannibalistic dwarves, gold-obsessed necromancers, or the \"cursed toadlings\" I picked almost reflexively: a people transformed along with their warrior Queen Charming. Each comes with a starting hero and traits for their cities units, plus a set of spellbooks that determine what research you'll have access to upfront.\nRead more",

          "description": "“Why am I so slow”, complains my partner, minutes into being cajoled into playing Dota 2 for the very first time. “Ah, you’ll need to buy boots,” I say, with the hard earned wisdom of someone who’s spent over 4,000 hours clicking on wizards. “I have boots,” she says, somewhat indignantly. “Those are slippers,” I reply. “What?” she asks, somewhat more indignantly. “They don’t give you move speed,” I respond. I see a flicker of anger in her eyes, as well as maybe, just maybe, a spark of interest.\r\n\n\r\nA new Dota patch came out last week, and it’s a biggun. Is it a good time for lapsed players to jump back in? Yes! Is it a good time for entirely new players to dip their toes in, while experienced players are still befuddled by a map that’s 40% bigger, featuring dual Roshan pits, new minibosses and a host of other changes? Perhaps! It’s certainly a good opportunity to test your relationship. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "When I meet Jake Solomon at GDC, it's his third day of unemployment. The XCOM and Marvel's Midnight Suns director and designer announced he was leaving Firaxis back in February, but his final day at the studio where he made his name and worked for more than twenty years was still very fresh in his memory. \"It's surreal,\" he says. \"For probably the next ten years, I'll refer to it as 'we' when we talk about Firaxis, and it's sad to think it's not the right pronoun anymore. It's exciting, but a little terrifying.\"\nOn the face of it, that panic might seem unfounded. Over the last decade, Solomon has become one of the most revered names in turn-based strategy games. Having cut his teeth on many of Sid Meier's Civilization games in his early years at Firaxis, he went on to become the designer who spearheaded the revival of XCOM with Enemy Unknown in 2012, before going on to direct its even more beloved sequel XCOM 2 and its War Of The Chosen expansion a few years later. Most recently, he was creative director on Marvel's Midnight Suns, which allowed him to marry his life-long love of Marvel comic books with the thrilling tactical combat he's so well known for. \nSolomon's next adventure, though, won't have the certainty of Midnight Suns' supercharged attack cards, or even the tease of an XCOM hit percentage backing him up. For not only is it Solomon's third day of unemployment when we speak; it's also the day after he revealed his plans to leave turn-based tactics games behind altogether. Instead, his sights are now set on the life simulation genre, a move that, at first glance, seems at odds with his career as a strategy designer. But over the course of our hour-long chat, it becomes increasingly clear that life sims have been a life-long obsession for Solomon, and he might have even made one by now had the development of XCOM 2 gone a little differently. \nRead more",

Somehow, despite being primed by the excellent time I had with its demo five years ago, I just bounced off this one. I very quickly got stuck in a frustrating loop of fatally ballsing up no matter what I did - presumably I badly biffed my stats right out the gate to get soft-locked in the first area - and despite deciding I'd restart in a day or two, several years later my play-time hasn't extended past that first session. Sad times all round, I'm sure you'll agree, but what's it got to do with Betrayal At Club Low?\nWell, when I picked up Betrayal At Club Low for the RPS Game Club this month, I was transported back to my abortive run at Disco Elysium. It's not that I've never played a stat-check-heavy RPG before. Far from it. But somehow, each game's presentation resonated together in my weird brain mush. It must have been something to do with the combination of a surreal, seedy, not-quite-our-world-but-still-very-recognisable setting, and the constant presence of numbers reminding me of my character's strengths stacked up against their many, many weaknesses.\nRead more",

          "description": "Honkai: Star Rail throws you into the body of an amnesiac protagonist with unknowable hidden powers who has been awakened from a deep slumber by someone called Kafka. This woman is something of a mystery and seems to have a flair for the dramatic as she kicks off the whole game by playing an invisible violin along to the classic Baroque epic Pachelbel’s Canon as massive, intergalactic monsters invade a spaceship.\nIt’s an incredibly cool opening, the kind of thing that John Wick would watch to get pumped up before, well, John Wick-ing all over the place. It’s pretty clear that Kafka isn’t a hero, but they’ve woken you up, and since you’ve got no memories, you must be one of the good guys. This setup feels familiar, but there are enough changes to make it feel new and get the blood thoroughly pumping.\nRead more",

My favourite detail is that you can become a werewolf and “do werewolf things”. Although getting to that stage may take a while, as associate game director Joseph Piepora recently said it would take around 150+ hours for an average player to hit the Level 100 cap.

          "description": "For all its flamingo thigh stews, misshapen clothes model characters and pizza-themed DJ-ing, Betrayal At Club Low is an old-school, dice-throwing RPG through and through. Every interaction you have at Club Low is determined by the rolling of dice, whether it's simply attempting to spark a conversation with a hard-of-hearing bartender, or bluffing your way into VIP backrooms where your blown fellow agent Gemini Jay is currently being grilled by the intimidating Big Mo. \nWhether you're successful in your endeavours depends on whether you can roll higher or equal to whatever value is thrown by your opponent, with each face corresponding to a particular Skill Dice you're trying to deploy to win that scenario. A lot of the time, your skill numbers aren't nearly good enough to beat your fellow clubber outright, but for me, the thrill of Club Low comes from clinching a very plain, and highly unremarkable draw, earning you the accolade of 'Success. Barely' in the ensuing results breakdown. It may not sound very sexy, but in a world where the odds are fully stacked against you, barely succeeding will do me just fine here, thanks.\nRead more",

          "description": "As our shuttle hits the ground, the world erupts into smoke, chaos, and confusion. Samantha, one among my ragged band of survivors, breaks down sobbing on the ground and I direct Maki, a veterinarian, to do something about it. She punches Samantha full-on in the face, knocking her unconscious (“Oh, I guess that’s what ‘knock out’ means,” I realize a moment too late). Well, at least I don’t have to worry about her running off into the woods or something. It’s a rough start, but they have no choice but to work together from here on out.\nFor fans of the survival simulation genre, crashlanding on an alien planet is a familiar premise, but it's one Stranded: Alien Dawn absolutely smashes. This game has been at the top of my to-be-played list for a while and now that it’s exiting early access for a full release, it’s safe to say that Stranded is the closest thing to my dream human vs nature survival game I’ve seen yet.\nRead more",

Out later this year, it's a combination puzzle-platformer and conscruction game in which you play a wombat, wearing a hard hat, who constructs increasingly complex things out of his own feces. That is no way to make a skyscraper, wombat.\nRead more",

A brand new method for delivering piping hot recs from my desktop to yours.\nMy aim is to use this series as a springboard to dive deep into specific elements of a game I find particularly fascinating, sharing my discoveries with you lot behind the paywall first (and don't worry, regular readers, I'll also be making each of these videos public for all to see after a month, which should roughly coincide with the the next one going live for supporters). In it, I'll be discussing some common themes between multiple games, digging into underappreciated gems from years gone by... The remit is broad and nebulous, to the point where it's clearly obvious why I haven't been able to come up with a name for it yet.\r\n\n(If you end up thinking of something, please do let me know in the comments. More than anything it'll stop me messaging Katharine a list of awful possibilites every other week, which I can only imagine is negatively effecting her feelings about me, the site and the endeavour of games journalism in general.

In all seriousness, though, Crime O'Clock looks to be its own distinctive beast (and not just because you seem to play as a rabbit). It has shades of Where’s Wally? (or Waldo, Wanda, Willy, Valli, and my favourite, Ali for international readers) as you’re given densely illustrated maps to navigate, and pick out key details in order to stitch together clues to solve cases. It could be very cool if all the right cogs click together. \nRead more",

Thank you all for your kind support! I look forward to serve you in the future! (an amicable settlement)\"\nJoining the studio in 2006, Nagamatsu plied his trade on some of the biggest releases for Nintendo platforms, composing music for Wii releases Super Mario Galaxy 2 and Wii Sports Resort. 3DS titles The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds, Mario Kart 8, and Mario Party: Star Rush, and in more recent years oversaw music composition and voice recordings for Switch titles Splatoon 3, Mario Party Superstars, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.\nWe can very likely look forward to hearing his exciting and evocative compositions in future works.\nThe post Nintendo composer Ryo Nagamatsu has departed the studio appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If I could turn back time\nAnother Riot Forge production is on the way, this time exploring the world of League of Legends' Ekko. Converegence: A League of Legends Story is a 2D action platformer starring the time-and-space-travelling fighter, and it arrives on May 23, 2023.\nDeveloped by Speed Brawl studio Double Stallion Games, Convergence follows Ekko as he deals with a threat to the city of Zaun. From today's trailer, it looks like Ekko will be interacting with his future self, as well as rewinding time in the short-term too, in order to foil some catastrophe.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qqdGiHBStk\nConvergence's platforming and action also makes use of Ekko's unique time abilities. From gaining an advantage over foes to rewinding a missed jump, it definitely feels like something Prince of Persia: Sands of Time should be keeping an eye on.\nThe story follows Ekko through the undercity of Zaun too, so Arcane fans should get a little bit more out of this than other locales. But of course, there are champions to fight too. Alongside Ekko, three other champions have been confirmed: Jinx, Camille, and Warwick.\nTime after time\nIt feels like only yesterday that The Mageseeker, the latest Riot Forge production, came out. While that one followed the magical rebellion happening within Demacia, Ekko's exploits in Zaun will be a bit different, both in setting and gameplay.\nAll of these, as well as the upcoming Song of Nunu, are part of Riot Games' publishing arm Forge. The idea has been to expand the world of League of Legends through third-party projects, and so far, it seems like it's been doing alright. Games like The Mageseeker and Ruined King were solid, fresh approaches to Runeterra. Maybe the streak can keep up with Convergence.\nConvergence: A League of Legends Story goes live for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on May 23.\nThe post Convergence: A League of Legends Story rewinds the clock on May 23 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The entire collection finally arrived on PlayStation and Nintendo Switch just last month, and consists of legendary releases Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy II, Final Fantasy III, Final Fantasy IV, Final Fantasy V and, you guessed it, Final Fantasy VI. The new console reports have received praise from both critics and fans alike.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bI80df5OrA&ab_channel=FINALFANTASY\nEach release sees the games that defined a genre sharpened up for modern displays, while retaining the nostalgic and warmth-inducing sprites and environments of their 8-bit and 16-bit roots, overseen by original artist Kazuko Shibuya. Audio has been restored by composer Nobuo Uematsu, and a fresh run of balance tweaks and bug fixes have been made to the releases, fixing issues that have existed — in some cases — for nigh-on four decades. The console editions of the games include the option to switch to each title's classic soundtrack, as well as utilize an easier-on-the-eyes \"pixel font\".\nThe Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series is available now on PC, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, and iOS and Android platforms.\nThe post Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series passes two million sales mark appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Qu'est-ce que c'est?\nTorture Star Video has announced the next game from Bloodwash duo Black Eyed Priest and Henry Hoare, Sniper Killer. The short-form horror game is due for release on PC sometime in 2023.\nThe twist in Sniper Killer is that you control both the eponymous sharpshooter and a detective trying to stop them. While the sniper has the goal of simply delivering high-caliber snacks into the faces of their victims, Detective Comardy is searching for clues and trying to end the killings. The information on it suggests that the detective is a past-his-prime burnout, which I can definitely relate to.\nhttps://youtu.be/Q4h117kC1J0\nThe last game from the duo was Night at the Gates of Hell, which was a fun, tacky zombie shooter. In my review, I noted that “It gives a strong impression that the developer had as much fun creating it as you will have playing it,” which is a sentiment that still sounds accurate to me.\nMeanwhile, Bloodwash was a slow-cooker slasher title. I found that one to be extremely inventive in that most of the game was spending time while waiting for your laundry to finish. You could literally just sit and wait. But it was more fun to wander around the shopping plaza, learning about the murders that have been going on.\nBeing the victim in short-form lo-fi horror risks getting stale after a few years of iterating on it. However, trying to solve the mystery while alternating as the cause of the mystery sounds absolutely fab to me.\nSniper Killer is coming to PC sometime in 2023.\nThe post Lo-fi horror Sniper Killer coming from creators of Bloodwash appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s slated for a PC release in 2024.\nTimes & Galaxy casts you as the first-ever robot reporter. You’ll pick your story, do some interviews, and scoop your scoop. You then have to assemble the story yourself (not actually write it out). In order to impress your readers and, more importantly, your editors, you’ll be covering important topics such as cat shows and toy launches, and rubbing elbows with your co-workers between assignments.\nhttps://youtu.be/KMjufslCX0o\nThis feels a little close to home to me. That’s maybe because multiple writers on the Copychaser Games team worked in journalism. I hesitate to call myself a “journalist” because people like to hurt my feelings by putting that in quotation marks. Also because it implies a certain degree of professionalism that I don’t want to commit to. Otherwise, I’m afraid it will mean I might have to stop using the word “butthole” so often.\nTime & Galaxy looks fantastic, though. Beyond the colorful aesthetic, the awesome premise, and the excellent writing, the idea of having a machine try and write news has a lot of opportunity for satire. I mean, people are already talking about having AI take over the jobs of journalists. Is that what you really want? Robots know nothing about buttholes, and they definitely won’t overuse and misuse the word “scoop.” You come to me for that kind of \"quality\" content.\nTimes & Galaxy is currently only confirmed for PC, and it will be coming sometime in 2024. To whet your appetite for hot scoops, you can try out a demo for it today.\nThe post Times & Galaxy lets you scoop news as a robot appeared first on Destructoid.",

While many additions could be considered “small,” it will conclude with paid DLC at the end of the year.\nFirst up, we’ve got map markers. I didn’t even realize they weren’t already in the game. I guess I just didn’t need them so hard that I never looked to see if they were there.\nNext up is a feature I always appreciate: a photo mode. It's always nice being able to set up the perfect visual. You’ll get this ability from a character in the game and can then use it to find new wildlife to snap photos of. As part of this update, you’ll be able to turn off the aggressive behavior of certain sea monsters. While I feel like vulnerability is sort of central to the horror of Dredge, it will be helpful for anyone who just wants to explore without being harrowed.\nIn Q3, the Dredge team will be adding boat customization. Once again, I didn't necessarily look for this while playing, but I always love new ways to get creative. This will come in the form of paint schemes and flags.\nLife at sea\nFinally, at the end of the year, Black Salt Games will release paid DLC for Dredge. The DLC will center around a mysterious corporation known as Ironhaven. While they claim to be simply investing in drilling operations to revitalize the area’s towns and settlements, their actual goals seem much more sinister. Nonetheless, you’ll be aiding them with building up their facilities while uncovering their secrets.\nWhile I wasn’t in love with Dredge, I appreciate it thematically. The paid DLC seems kind of cool, and I might be willing to check it out when it finally drops at the end of the year.\nIf you haven’t dropped anchor on Dredge, it’s available on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch.\nThe post Team17 reveals roadmap (seamap?) for Dredge updates appeared first on Destructoid.",

There was no way it could possibly be good.\nIt’s not, but it definitely has a butthole.\n[caption id=\"attachment_376588\" align=\"alignnone\" wi…",

Art and memes have already been flooding social channels. And in a turn that surprised me a bit, the Trailblazer—the main character chosen by the player—is getting quite a bit of attention.\nIn Honkai: Star Rail, you assemble a party of adventurers and explorers to travel across the stars, dealing with the ever-present Stellaron threat. As you travel between worlds, you meet an ever-expanding cast of characters, though it remains centered on the Astral Express crew and your chosen Trailblazer. Though referred to by a chosen name or their pseudonym, fans often refer to the male version as Caelus and female as Stelle.\nhttp…",

          "description": "Modders doing what Sega don't\nWe never got a taste of Sega’s 2000 Dreamcast title, Rent-A-Hero No. 1. But fans have stepped in where the company let us down by creating a very comprehensive translation of the title.\nOriginally released in Japan in May, 2000, Rent-A-Hero No. 1 was a game that got lost in the implosion of the Dreamcast. Sega eventually ported it to Xbox in 2003, but since that was when the company’s support of Microsoft was starting to waver, it never made it across the pond. This is despite the fact that some reviewers at the time were actually provided with copies of the translated version.\nRent-A-Hero No. 1 is an action RPG about a 16-year-old who gets a set of armor that allows them to take a part-time job as a super-hero. Perhaps Sega never wanted to market it over here because of its deep roots in Japanese culture. That’s less of a problem in today’s world of Yakuza and Persona titles, but at the time, it was enough to give publishers pause.\nRent-A-Hero No. 1, is actually a remake of the 1991 Genesis/Mega Drive title that also was never localized. You know, it’s never too late, Sega.\nUntil they realize that, a hefty team of unofficial modders (dubbed the Rent-A-Modders) did a pretty outstanding job at handling the localization. Beyond translating the text, the team added many exclusive features, including new models and animations, VMU graphics, and secret modes. It’s a hefty little patch that has a lot of love behind it.\nYou can find the patch, as well as the full credits of the Rent-A-Modders, right here on their Github.\nThe post Lost Dreamcast classic Rent-A-Hero No. 1 gets fan translation appeared first on Destructoid.",

By the time Horizon Forbidden West's credits roll, Aloy has faced off against massive Tremortusks and clashed with a group of tech geniuses from outer space. With the recently released Burning Shores DLC, the battles are taken to the next level, with the final boss featuring the greatest battle thus far.\nDespite the franchise's embrace of all things epic, Burning Shores illustrates that it is also capable of creating subtle yet impactful moments.

Hot off of last week's announcement that the hit animated show Totally Spies! was getting set for a long-awaited TV comeback, publisher Microids has announced that it has a brand new video game adaptation in the works, set to launch on consoles and PC in 2024, alongside the girl's TV return.\nTotally Spies! which originally screened in the very early '00s, sees World Organization of Human Protection (WOOHP) agents Sam, Clover, and Alex embark on a series of deadly (read: silly) missions in order to protect the free world from a rogues' gallery of terrorists and villains, while also attempting to balance their death-defying deeds with the upscale Beverly Hills lifestyles. The show, which ran for over 150 episodes, was notable for its stylistic, anime-inspired approach to its action, screwball comedy, and facial animations.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXpbRn5fDH0&ab_channel=FrancaisToonFan\nWhile Totally Spies! has been off the air since 2015, with the ending of its sixth season, it was revealed just last week that a seventh season is now in production at Cartoon Network, and is scheduled to premiere in 2024. While no details are currently available on Microids' tie-in video game title, the game has been licensed and commissioned specifically in line with the TV show's return.\n\"Microids is committed to faithfully and innovatively adapting well-known IP and it is a real honor for us to work on the Totally Spies! license,\" said Microids CEO Stephane Longeard in a press release. \"Thanks to the skills of our studios and in-house teams, we will do everything we can to offer the community a game that meets its expectations.\"\nTotally Spies! will launch on PC and console platforms in 2024.\nThe post Totally Spies! to return in 2024 with new season and video game appeared first on Destructoid.",

Microsoft intends to appeal the CMA's decision. In August, Microsoft will also be required to face down a lawsuit from the United States' Federal Trade Commission (FTC) which has remained steadfastly in opposition to the Activision Blizzard purchase since its initial announcement back in January 2022.\nUkraine approves Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard [GamesIndustry.biz]\nThe post Ukraine is the latest territory to approve Microsoft/Activision purchase bid appeared first on Destructoid.",

As one would expect, Galaga '88 features much-improved audio/visual elements, including more detailed character sprites and a variety of background images.\nCheck out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber World of Longplays.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62h9LUt3OQg&ab_channel=WorldofLongplays\nDespite receiving much acclaim from critics and Japanese arcade goers, Galaga '88 would receive slight home ports, appearing via the PC Engine as the confusingly renamed Galaga '90, as well as on the Sharp X68000 home computer. In later years, the shmup would find itself packaged as part of numerous Namco compendiums, while also appearing on the Wii Virtual Console and even Japanese mobile platforms.\nGalaga '88 is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nThe post Galaga ’88 brings a r-r-remix to the Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Redfall is now available for players worldwide, but unfortunately, I’ve only been playing for a few days and cannot provide a full review yet.\nWriting this Redfall review-in-progress is painful because Arkane Studios is one of my favorite game developers, and its new game is largely disappointing. While the open world is beautifully sculpted with intriguing vistas, it’s weirdly empty, often implying that the harbor town’s vampire usurpers invaded during the offseason. \nAs a whole, Redfall’s gameplay is unbalanced. Several puzzling decisions, like a lack of stealth takedowns or the inability to pause the game in single-player mode, are far from what I’d expect from an Arkane game. Rampant technical issues hinder the brighter moments of the experience, including frequent server crashes, inputs failing to work, NPCs and enemies spawning duplicate versions of themselves, and one very frustrating bug which prevents me from closing the world map and main menu in cooperative play. \nOn a positive note, I like the four launch protagonists, each with unique skills you can upgrade via a straightforward-but-effective skill tree. Also, a handful of weapons are neat, like the heavy-hitting stake launcher or ultra-violet raygun that turns vampires to stone. A few locations, like a deranged scientist’s mansion, a cliffside lighthouse, and a hangar repurposed as a prison quarter, provide enough challenge to incentivize intelligent pathfinding. Unfortunately, most locations and enemy placements feel haphazardly designed – certainly a byproduct of creating two open-world maps. \nHowever, my evaluation may change in the coming days. I’ve completed roughly 50 percent of the game and its first story arc, but I’ve only played for a few days and have more content to see.\n\nWe’re reviewing Redfall on PC. Here are our computer specs: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090, AMD Ryzen 9 5950X 16-Core Processor, 64GB RAM",

According to Variety, the film has grossed $490 million in North America and $532 million internationally, adding up to rough total of over $1 billion. Despite a tepid critical reception, Illumination’s adaptation of Nintendo’s flagship franchise has already become the highest-grossing video game film ever, the highest opening weekend, and the top-grossing film of 2023 so far.  \nThe Super Mario Bros.

          "description": "Vampire Survivors is going Hollywood thanks to the announcement of an upcoming animated TV adaptation. \nDeveloper poncle has confirmed that it's working with gaming consulting company Robot Teddy and media company Story Kitchen to bring the hit arcade bullet hell game to the small screen. Story Kitchen is helmed by names such as Dmitri Johnson (co-producer of the Sonic the Hedgehog films), John Wick creator/writer Derek Kolstad, and APA agent Mike Goldberg. There’s currently no other details about what the series will entail, such as the cast or a premiere date. \n“The most important thing in Vampire Survivors is the story, so it's a dream come true to see what started as a little indie game I made on my weekends come to life as an animated TV show! It’s also great to be partnering up with such experienced and talented people to make the show. I do wonder if they've realised that there isn't a single vampire in Vampire Survivors, though,” says Luca Galante, founder of poncle in a press release.\nIf you're tilting your head wondering how a pixelated arcade game can be translated into a show, it's worth nothing that Vampire Survivors has been brought to life in animated form before. Its two expansions – Legacy of the Moonspell and the recently launched Tides of the Foscari – both featured slick animated trailers, so those could be reference points for how this series may potentially appear. \nVampire Survivors has been on quite a roll since it launched to widespread acclaim last year, scooping up several end-of-year awards and walking away with a couple of BAFTA trophies this year, including winning Best Game.

It will also feature a new chapter called \"The Final Note\" that gives players an alternate perspective on the first game's story. Layers of Fear is being developed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. You can check out the game's performance, as well as its new mechanics and visual enhancements, in the gameplay trailer below: \n\n\nLayers of Fear will support Ray-Tracing, HDR, and 4K resolution. Plus, it uses Lumen global illumination (you might recognize the word \"Lumen\" from Epic Games' Unreal Engine showcase back in 2021), Niagara visual effects \"to create particle effects in real time\" and Action System Controls \"to improve the development process and optimization of all gameplay mechanics,\" according to a press release. \n\"Creating games with Unreal Engine 5 is a great opportunity for the whole team, as it means our game development process can skyrocket in quality,\" Anshar Studios lead programmer Tomasz Bilnicki writes in the press release. \"It has an incredible power when it comes to the implementation of dynamic lighting, shadows, and potentially beautiful worlds for players to explore. We hope that – thanks to the engine – we'll provide players with the unique, immersive, visually stunning, and atmospheric experience in graphical fidelity.\" \nLayers of Fear will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in June. \nFor more, read Game Informer's review of Layers of Fear and then check out our thoughts on its sequel in our Layers of Fear 2 review. \nAre you picking up Layers of Fear this June?

And we can't wait to check it out in just a few months. \nThe trailer also reveals what you can expect from the game's various digital editions and the special Collector's Edition – check them both out below: \n\nArmored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon launches on August 25, 2023.

          "description": "Microsoft has released its financial results for Q3 of its 2023 Fiscal Year, which consists of roughly January through March of this year. In it, the company revealed that Xbox hardware revenue is down but its Xbox content and services revenue is slightly up thanks to Xbox Game Pass subscription growth. \nMore specifically, Xbox hardware is down 30% and Xbox content and services is up 3%. Overall, Xbox's gaming revenue is down 4%, though. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that the company set third-quarter records for monthly active users and devices, and that Xbox's gaming subscriptions (see: Game Pass) reached almost $1 billion this quarter. Despite this growth and revenue, though, Microsoft did not release new numbers regarding Game Pass subscription count – the latest count was 25 million in January 2022. \nAs for the dip in hardware revenue, Microsoft says the decline comes from the comparison of this quarter this year to the same quarter in the previous fiscal year, which gained a boost thanks to increased console supply. \nHere are some other numbers from Microsoft's financial results: \nRevenue was $52.9 billion, an increase of 7% (or 10% in constant currency)\nOperating income was $22.4 billion, an increase of 10% (or 15% in constant currency)\nNet income was $18.3 billion, an increase of 9% (or 14% in constant currency)\nXbox hardware revenue is down 30%\nXbox content and services revenue is up 3%\nOverall, Xbox gaming revenue is down 4%\nThese results arrived yesterday, shortly before the Competition and Markets Authority, a U.K. regulatory agency that serves the same purpose as the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., blocked Microsoft's $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard today. You can read more about that here. \nWhat do you think Xbox needs to do to increase Xbox hardware revenue? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "Just a few days away from the launch of Horizon Forbidden West's Burning Shores DLC last week, Guerrilla Games has teased more adventures with Aloy. \nThis news comes from a statement released by the studio to announce that studio director and executive producer Angie Smets is leaving Guerrilla to serve as the head of development strategy for PlayStation Studios. It's a move similar to the one the team's former managing director, Hermen Hulst, made in 2019, transitioning from that director position to head of Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios. \n\n\nWithin that statement, Guerrilla teases what could be Horizon 3 or at least, a third game in Aloy's world, as reported by PlayStation Lifestyle. \n\"We have full confidence in our new leadership as they steer Guerrilla towards a bright future, expanding the world of Horizon with Aloy's next adventure and our exciting online project,\" the statement reads. \nAs you can see, Guerrilla isn't trying to hide it – the studio has plans for another adventure with Aloy. And while rumors and speculation point to the \"exciting online project\" being some kind of multiplayer game within the Horizon world, this statement made sure to separate Aloy's next adventure and that online project. \nIn terms of the studio's new makeup, the management team now consists of studio and production director Joel Eschler, studio director and general manager Hella Schmidt, and studio and art director Jan-Bart van Beek. Technical director Michiel van der Lee will \"be focusing on the future technology and strategy for the Decima engine.\" \nThis statement also includes some words from Smets, who leaves Guerrilla after \"an incredible 20 years\" there: \nFor more about Horizon, read Game Informer's Horizon Forbidden West review. \n[Source: PlayStation Lifestyle]\nWhat do you think comes first?

Join us today Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel. \nBanjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey. \nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

Thankfully, today’s Street Fighter 6 Showcase finally pulled the curtain back on what World Tour entails and it looks delightfully bonkers.\nWorld Tour begins with players creation a custom fighter that serves as the mode’s protagonist. Upon creating your avatar (which can be used outside of World Tour in the online Battle Hub), you’re dropped into Metro City from the Final Fight series, one of the World Tour’s many explorable city hubs. Other destinations include the developing Asian city, Nayshall. \nAs a fledgling fighter, you’ll embark on a quest to become a world warrior. You’ll accomplish this completing qu…",

          "description": "Much like its predecessor, Street Fighter 6 will have an ambitious post-release content plan. While we knew there would be downloadable content, we now have a much better idea about the cadence with which the new characters will arrive.\n\"A big part of Street Fighter's charm is the cast of characters from around the world that appear in each game,\" executive producer Shuhei Matsumoto said during today's Street Fighter 6 Showcase livestream. \"We believe that Street Fighter is where players can take control of unique characters with their own awesome fighting styles. For the players – and for us as well – the appeal of the characters themselves is the most important element of the series. With Street Fighter 6, we're continuing development to deliver new characters to you every year.\"\nDuring Year 1, which kicks off when the game launches, we will receive four new characters to the Street Fighter 6 roster. Rashid, A.K.I., Ed, and Akuma are the characters who will be made available during this first year of content. Rashid, who debuted in the base version of Street Fighter V, arrives in summer 2023. A.K.I., an all-new character, will arrive in fall 2023. Ed, who debuted in Street Fighter IV but was first playable in Street Fighter V, arrives in the early parts of 2024. Akuma, the Great Demon who first appeared in Super Street Fighter II Turbo, joins Street Fighter 6 in spring 2024. These characters will also appear in World Tour, the single-player RPG-inspired story mode, giving players some insight into their backgrounds.\nIf you buy either the Deluxe ot Ultimate Editions, you get the Year 1 characters included in that version. Street Fighter 6 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on June 2.

Thus, it's opening the gates of Sanctuary to players one more time in a third open beta next month. \nThis next test weekend, dubbed Server Slam weekend, begins May 12 at 12 p.m. Pacific and ends May 14 at the same time. As the name suggests, Blizzard is running this beta to stress test the servers to make sure they're as sturdy as possible come June. This slice of the game is similar to the March betas in terms of content, but it will include updates and bug fixes garnered from feedback to the previous betas.\nServer Slam weekend will be a clean slate as progression from the previous betas does not carry over. Additionally, the beta supports couch co-op, cross-play, and cross-progression. Players can explore Fractured Peaks in its entirety through the Prologue and Act 1, complete World Events, and face Ashava, the toughest available World Boss. Completing challenges can earn the following new rewards:\nThe Initial Casualty title (earned by reaching Kyovashad with one character)\nThe Early Voyager title (earned by reaching Level 20 on one character)\nThe Beta Wolf Pack Cosmetic (earned by reaching Level 20 with one character)\nA new reward: the Cry of Ashava Mount Trophy (earned by defeating Ashava with one Level 20 character).\nDiablo IV launches on June 6 for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.

It will release on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC. Alongside this release date, Night School Studio also released a new trailer showcasing more of what to expect in this spooky paranormal thriller and there's a lot going on. \n\n\nSet five years after the first Oxenfree, which was released in 2016, Oxenfree II follows Riley as she returns to her hometown of Camena to investigate some strange electromagnetic waves. Just four hours ago, a mysterious cult opened a portal above Edwards Island, and Riley and her friends aren't sure they're the ones that need to save the island but they know they have to. The trailer seems to indicate we'll be playing with different timelines, spooky ghosts from other side, and more, and we'll be doing so using a special radio. \nThis time, though, we'll also have a walkie talkie to interact with locals and learn more about what might be going on. Oxenfree II: Lost Signals looks great and it hits PlayStation, Switch, and PC on July 12, 2023. \nOxenfree II: Lost Signals was originally due out in 2022 but it was delayed to 2023 last September.

Publisher Humble Games announced this during today's Nintendo Indie World Showcase alongside a new trailer showcasing more of the game's titular night market. Unsurprisingly, Mineko's Night Market continues to look great and we can't wait to learn more about this special village later this year. \n\n\nIn Mineko's Night Market, an old Japanese-inspired village at the center of Mt. Fugu is visited long ago by Miko, a cat-like god. Miko visits the farms of this village each year to grant good fortune and prosperity to the farmers. However, some farmers grow impatient with their blessings and drive Miko out. With Miko banished from the land, this village works hard to create its own success and as time goes on, fewer and fewer people believe in the myth of Miko. \nBut some still do, and it sounds like we'll learn more about what that means for some characters throughout our journey in the game. \nIn the game, you'll befriend townsfolk, craft doodads, and ultimately prepare for the weekly night market. The quiet village becomes a bustling hub of commerce, parades, cat races, and stage performances. And when you're exploring the island, everything you find can be brought back and sold on the market. \nMineko's Night Market hits Switch and PC on September 26, 2023.
