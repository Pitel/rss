For many Zelda fans, he holds just about as much prestige in the ranks of Nintendo as Shigeru Miyamoto, Takashi Tezuka, and the late, great Satoru Iwata.\nYet for as vital as Aonuma has proven himself to be for the growth of The Legend of Zelda, there’s another creator who has arguably taken even more of a crucial role in the franchise’s development in recent years: Hidemaro Fujibayashi. In fact, as of 2023, Fujibayashi holds the most directorial credits for the Zelda franchise, helming Oracle of Ages and Seasons, Four Swords, The Minish Cap, Skyward Sword, Breath of the Wild, and Tears of the Kingdom.

Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown will run at 60fps on the Switch, both handheld and docked. This was stated by The Game Awards' host Geoff Keighley way back in the summer of 2023, but it's good to get the official word.

Did you know that the gaming industry is bigger than Hollywood? Yes, Steve. Everyone knows that.\nDespite this, the mainstream stereotype is largely still that gamers are socially-challenged dweebs who need to get out more. You'd think that people would know better by now — and in some cases, it's difficult to imagine how they don't know better — but here we are; still being told to take a shower, leave the house, touch grass, and expand our horizons beyond a high score and a flagpole.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Over the Christmas holidays, I had very good intentions to finally tackle some of the big games from 2023. I still haven't played Resident Evil 4, System Shock, very much of Baldur's Gate 3 or Assassin's Creed Mirage, and I really wanted to play a bit of Avatar: Frontiers Of Pandora. You know, just for a little look after the quite interesting preview I did back in October. Admittedly, I wasn't anywhere near my PC for at least one of the two weeks I had off, as I was away doing the inevitable family roulette of Christmas visiting. I also knew that, even if I had spent the whole time at home, there would be no way I'd finish or get through all of them. I knew I was sort of setting myself up to fail, but as I said. Good intentions. I did have my Steam Deck with me, after all, and even went to the trouble of loading it up with around 50 games, including some of those biggies that I have on Steam. \nWhat did I actually end up playing though? Teeny games. Six of 'em, which were all four to six hours long. And some of them I didn't even enjoy very much! Why? Why do I do this? In some respects I'm pleased I managed to clear a bit more of my backlog, but man alive, I always fall into exactly the same trap. I play the shorties, and always leave the biggies, like I'm allergic to anything over four hours - and I don't like it.\nRead more",

Spider-themed snipers and six-gun slinging cowboys share space with winged angelic healers and a talking gorilla with a Tesla cannon -  characters who reward positioning and timely ability usage just as much as one’s ability to click on heads. When the game went free to play and slapped a 2 on the end in 2022, it got a more muted reception, but the dev team have displayed a great willingness to experiment. In fact, there's never been a better time to give Overwatch 2 a go.\nRead more",

It's a time for making plans, setting goals, thinking about all the cool new games I'll be playing over the next 12 months (while also looking nervously at the pile of games I missed over the last 12 months and placing them very, very gingerly on the teetering and totteringly tall pile of my backlog). And, of course, making some new year's resolutions. Traditionally, I don't often set myself too many resolutions - I always give myself a reading goal (35 books is what I'm aiming for this year), for example, but the rest I usually play pretty fast and loose with - more 'nice to haves' rather than 'musts', I'd say. \nThis year, though, I do have a few gaming-related resolutions on my list, and in discussing them with the rest of the RPS Treehouse, it turns out we all have some games-themed goals this year. So I thought it would be fun to share them with you all below. And if you've also made some gaming resolutions for 2024, tell us about them in the comments. We can hold ourselves accountable together, like that big curtain of eldritch eyeballs up there in the header from good game Norco. \nRead more",

Surprisingly goofy. Unsettling. But above all, a challenge. We walked back to our cars and tried - my mate was thrilled to have identified who Dave Bautista likely voiced in the dub (we watched sub) - to unpack what we saw.\nSince then, we've listened to podcasts, read interviews, and engaged in some back and forth. It's all brought me back to my uni days, where Dark Souls made me get my shovel out for the first time and mine the internet for meaning.

          "description": "Hideo Kojima's new Xbox Game Studios project OD is a horror game that is \"also a movie, and at the same time a new form of media\" and who knows, perhaps it also runs on solar power. That's the extremely direct and literal reading of Kojima's latest social media tease, in which he compares his latest endeavour to Boktai: The Sun Is In Your Hand, an isometric vampire-hunting game for Game Boy Advance, which Kojima worked on while at Konami in the early noughties. Boktai stands apart to this day for making use of solar energy. There's a sun sensor built into the cartridge, which allows you to re-energise your weapon by using the console in sunlight, though this isn't outright necessary to prevail.\nI doubt OD employs a similar peripheral, though a Steam Deck verified horror game that can only be played outdoors in pleasant weather would be an... interestingly contrary experience. But it's an opportunity, at least, to jump aboard one of my personal hobby horses and give you a scrappy rundown of older and recent games that employ similar functionality.\nRead more",

          "description": "I have been bouncing off Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, partly because the new protagonist design leaves me cold, and partly because it being a 2D affair has me yearning for something closer to the 1989 Apple II original, with its finicky platforming and sword-fighting. Katharine says it's decent, however, and the latest trailers are intriguing. One is an overview of the new metroidvania's locations, of which you can read much more in Katharine's last preview. The other is a quick dive into the game's approach to accessibility, which appears to be a lot more holistic than you'll find in many games. \r\n \nRead more",

A grizzled mafioso whose cheeks glitter with fragments of other people's teeth has as much chance of winning Russian Roulette as a sleepy five-year-old in SpongeBob pyjamas. But take Russian Roulette, swap the revolver for a pump-action shotgun, mix up live and dud rounds, and add Inscryption-esque items which let you change the rules, and now you have a more skillful game. That's Buckshot Roulette, the latest from Mike Klubnika, the dev behind those excellent horror games about operating machinery. Great weird machines here too.\nRead more",

The good news is that everyone seems to be taking a bit of a breather in 2024, because (at time of writing at least) the official \"big'uns\" calendar is looking remarkably slim at the moment. There are still some heavy-hitters coming our way this year, such as , Star Wars Outlaws and Path Of Exile 2, but 2024 looks like another year where it will be the smaller, independent games that shine the brightest. They certainly make up the bulk of our most anticipated games list for 2024, which the RPS Treehouse has been feverishly putting together over the last few days. The bad news is that there are still loads of great games coming out. So come, join us, and see what's on our personal wishlists for 2024.  \nRead more",

I was previously a snob about the Nancy Drew point and click puzzle games, and then came to regret it when a fan of them (very nicely) emailed me explaining they're actually really good. We're going to find out for ourselves by playing them. There are north of 30 in total, and I will update the rankings at the end of each article.\nThe first is 1998's Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill, in which Nancy solves the murder of a Floridian highschooler named Jake Roberts, and there's a lot to love about it right away. There's a restrained cast, three locations in total, and the school sports team is called the Fighting Manatees. Thus the icon for the game is a lil' cartoon manatee - and to be absolutely accurate, this is the remastered version of the game from 2010, not the original 90s version.

Last year I complained about Puzzmo's crossword clues being very US-centric and Excors commented that US and UK puzzles seem very different, both in their form and in the fact that UK crosswords are often crytpic. Which is true! Often if you see a \"quick crossword\" in a UK paper that means \"crossword with clues that are general knowledge questions and not an archaic set of riddles - you know, for if you're waiting for the kettle to boil, or are an idiot\". So I decided to look into how you actually do cryptics. It's way harder than I thought, but at the same time I did not realise it's just smug puns.\nRead more",

Excitement because I have never played Daggerfall and it is one of the weirder, more fantastical Elder Scrolls RPGs - the one with multiple endings which sequels have explained away as somehow all being canon thanks to a metaphysical event called a Dragon Break, whereby timelines branch and reconnect. And horror because I have never played Daggerfall, which is said to be 620,000 square miles in size, and I'm getting to that point in life where I seriously ask myself whether I can finish certain games before I perish.\nStill the journey is more important than reaching the destination, right?

          "description": "Tim Cain wrote what is perhaps gaming’s most famous and influential monologue: the introduction to Fallout. “War never changes,” he says. “People loved it. I’m like, ‘I must be a writer.’” Yet much more recently, when Cain sat down to write his memoirs, nobody really liked what came out on the page. “I was really, really bad at it,” he says. “I had half a dozen people read it, and they all pretty much said that the stories were good, but my writing wasn’t.”\r\n\n\r\nCain’s writing strengths, as fellow Fallout originator Leonard Boyarsky has suggested, lie in shortform. Which was bad news for anyone who wanted to read the definitive account of his four decades at the heart of Interplay, Troika and Obsidian, three of the most important RPG studios of all time. Thankfully, though, it turns out Cain is a natural raconteur. The same anecdotes that appeared flat and toneless in his memoirs go down a storm on YouTube. There, for the past seven months, Cain has been delivering his stories straight to camera, as if at a dinner party with 73,500 other people. “When I started the channel, I would effectively just look at something in the book and be like, ‘I’ll tell that story today,’” he says. “Now I spend as much time answering questions and doing videos based on things people ask about.” \r\n\n \nRead more",

We can expect the Maw's petulance to mount during January, a lean month for announcements and revelations, but there are a few tasty morsels in the offing - a new Prince of Persia and Tekken 8, for instance. Fingers crossed we can build up some kind of momentum.\nSome new game releases we are pointing our telescopes at this week: Skeleton Rebellion (4th Jan), a scrappy offbeat RPG with claymation elements in which you are a skeleton trying to overthrow some mages, and The Night Is Grey (5th Jan), a point-and-click adventure about a beardy bloke and a little girl stuck in the woods with some weirdo wolves. If you like, you can also play a free drinking game I've just invented in which you do a shot for every time I accidentally write 2023 instead of 2024.\n Read more",

I'm writing this in the distant past of mid-December, a period of total spiritual desolation. If all has gone to plan, I am currently waving a goblet over my head like some kind of hipster barbarian, and trying to finish all the dodgy vegan Xmas food I've cooked which the rest of my family won’t eat, the savages.\nI have now read our so-called RPS 2023 Advent Calendar and found it to be woefully deficient in flirty rebels, lunar deities and stage coaches packed with damned adventurers. Never fear, however, because by happy coincidence I have also now written an end-of-year/start-of-year round-up article about these very things.\nRead more",

One deal that caught our eye this morning is this deal on a Gigabyte RTX 4070 Windforce 3X OC model, which is down to £530.58 when bought from Amazon US via Amazon UK. \nThe deal price, which includes shipping and import duty, is significantly cheaper than UK-based options from major GPU makers which are in the £560 to £600 range. However, there are cheaper UK options if you're happy with a smaller, non-overclocked Palit card. Palit is more of a budget brand, but is built around the same Nvidia GPU and therefore offers the same performance. \nRead more",

That might be because I've not had a huge amount of time to play loads outside of review duties and general life things, but there's only been, like, less than a handful of games that have truly commanded my attention.\nOne of said games comes backflipping in right at the tailend of this year: Astral Ascent. It's a 2D roguelike in the vein of Dead Cells, where you battle through stages, power-up, try and get as far as you can, inevitably die, reinvest your winnings, power-up permanently, then go again. It saddens me that I've not seen much excitement for the game elsewhere, so here I am with a little pudding for you. A little treat. Here comes the plane, nyaaaooownnn.\nRead more",

Plus a couple others that came out of early access in 2023 but which I sadly don't have time to write about in full. Trust me, The Last Spell and Against The Storm are both phenomenal games as well.\nAnyway: in this handsomely decorated selection box, you'll find four of my honourable mentions for games I've enjoyed playing the most this year.

I didn't play quite as many small, odd things as I would have liked in 2023.

          "description": "This year's Game Awards ceremony garnered a lot of justified criticism for the way it rushed winning developers off stage in favour of adverts, rambling conversations with Hideo Kojima, and celebrity cameos from the likes of Timothée Chalamet. \r\n\nObsidian's Josh Sawyer was right when he called it an \"embarrassing indictment of a segment of the industry desperate for validation via star power\". Yet I still can't help but also see the Game Awards as something else: a sign of progress. That's because I remember the Spike Video Game Awards from 2007, which remains the nadir of both the games industry specifically and popular culture in general.\r\n\n \nRead more",

While I've only slapped one Bestest Best badge down in 2023 (woe is me), our lovely freelancers, current RPSers, and former RPSers have done a whole lot more badge-slapping. A grand total of 26 Bestest Bests have graced our monitors this year, which makes it three more than last year's Bestest Best round-up. And I'd say it's a nice mixture of big budget open worlders, puzzle gems, and indie delights that make up our roster for 2023, too.\nSo yeah, I'd encourage you to have a flick through the list below and see if there's anything you can add to the wishlist. Even as the person with \"Reviews\" in their job title, I can confirm I literally have loads of these Bestest Bests in my backlog. I will endeavour to play a handful over this Christmas break on my Steam Deck, maybe combining the experience with a nibble on a mince pie. Anyway, enjoy! And Merry Reviewsmas!\nRead more",

Prior to joining the RPS Treehouse in late October, I spent much of the year organising a massive international move with my family from the US to the UK, which meant that many of 2023's fresh releases - aside from the few that I've highlighted in this year's advent calendar - remained in the unplayed depths of my Steam list. Now that it's December and life has settled somewhat, I had to wrack my brain to come up with three entries for this Selection Box. After much deliberation, I realised that there were a few indie gems that I managed to crack open amidst all the chaos of arranging 60+ boxes for shipment across the Atlantic.\nRead more",

          "description": "Vánoce a s nimi spojené oslavy materialismu jsou již za námi a nastává tak druhá důležitá část - chlubení se dárečky. Pojďte proto ukázat, co za pěknou elektroniku jste dostali, na Virtuální Bastlírnu – online setkání bastlířů, elektrotechniků a obecně nadšenců do techniky! Kluci ze strahovského MacGyvera ukáží nový horkovzdušný a plotýnkový předehřev, nástroj na instalaci závitových vložek a nebo velmi přesnou napěťovou referenci.\r\nPokud jste žádný vychytaný dárek nedostali, nebojte. Sice se toho za poslední měsíc se mnoho zajímavého neudálo, nicméně tentokrát zajímavost připravených témat nejspíše předčí jejich kvantitu. Proběhla totiž konference 37C3, na které došlo na prezentaci výsledků analýzy a hackování polských vlaků, které výrobce záměrně na dálku vyřazoval z provozu. Dále pak rušení GPS v poslední době, taktéž v Polsku. Vyšly zajímavé videoprohlídky fabrik firem Průša a ASML. Siglent chystá nové řady 12 osciloskopů jako odpověď na Rigol a O2 zavádí v Česku IoT síť Cat-M.\r\n\r\nZe světa HW mohou strahováci ukázat průsvitný procesor nebo jak se může vymstít snaha používat power planes v Altiu místo polygonů, zatímco ze světa SW novou verzi nástroje pro reverzní inženýrství Ghidra nebo to, že iPhony by už nemělo jít shodit pomocí Flipper Zero.\r\n\r\n\r\nPříští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v úterý 9. ledna od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

In particular, the recently launched Intel Core Ultra 7 155H. For those curious about what the performance is likely to roughly be in comparison to the AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme, here are some benchmarks looking at the performance of these competing SoCs.",

          "description": "After hitting Early Access back in June 2021, we finally have a date for the initial launch of Phantom Abyss. The trap-dodging asynchronous multiplayer game is coming to Xbox Series X|S and PC via Steam and the Humble Store on January 25. \n\n\nPublisher Devolver Digital and developer Team WIBY let the latest announcement loose on Steam. You can see some lightning-fast snippets of Version 1.0 in action in the launch date trailer below.\n\n\n\n\nFor those just now seeing what Team WIBY has been working on, Phantom Abyss tosses players into procedurally generated temples with the straightforward but challenging task of retrieving sacred relics. As anyone who has ever traversed even the most modest of temples will tell you, that's just askin' for booby traps. From perilous chasms to temple guards, you only get one chance to survive and make your way through each temple, so you have to choose your relic path wisely. \n\n\nThe asynchronous multiplayer comes into play as you explore the temples and spot the phantoms of fallen players who have come and gone in that temple before. You can observe the actions and deadly missteps of up to 20 phantoms — including Steam friends and total strangers — and try not to repeat the same mistakes. \n\n\nFortune and glory\n\n\nIt's been a while since we checked the game out for ourselves, and a lot can happen in over two years of Early Access. \n\n\nAmong the updates to look for as we venture into 1.0 are a completely overhauled Adventure Mode, a new Abyss Mode, and changes to Whips. The Abyss Mode was previously known as Classic Mode and acts as the heart of the game, letting players roll the dice to make their way through all four areas of a unique temple to collect the relic waiting at the end. \n\n\nWe can all look forward to failing miserably at it together later this month. \n\nThe post Trap-filled asynchronous multiplayer game Phantom Abyss has a release date appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "In December, a fighting game based on the hit manga/anime Hunter x Hunter was announced. Yesterday, Bushiroad Games and developer Eighting revealed the first teaser for the game, now called Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact, as well as six playable characters.\n\n\n\n\nIn the brief 30-second trailer, we get some in-engine footage alongside voice-overs from Gon and Killua, presumably from their original VAs. We didn't get any gameplay or release date. However, it does seem that the game will utilize 3v3 fighting similar to Dragon Ball FighterZ.\n\n\nAs previously mentioned, it looks like the game has already confirmed six playable characters. The video shows Gon, Killua, Leorio, Kurapika, Hisoka, and Neteru all walking into a stadium and preparing for battle.\n\n\nGreat, another tournament arc!\n\n\nHaving watched the anime, it felt nostalgic to hear the VAs and see the Hunter x Hunter crew again. The graphics are a bit simple, but the game is in development, so it’ll shape up over time. Anime fighting games can be hit/miss. For every Dragon Ball FighterZ, there’s a Jump Force.\n\n\nIt does get me excited to see who’s going to be next. Perhaps Neferpitou or Mereum? Or maybe Ging? I bet he’d show up here instead of being there for Gon’s childhood. Still a bit sore about that.\n\n\nIf you haven’t read or watched Hunter x Hunter, it is a must for fans of great action and even better characters. It follows Gon, a young islander, who leaves his home to become the best Hunter ever, like his father. While it may seem charming at first, it gets dark –Chimera Ant Arc anyone?–, resulting in some of the best anime you can find. It’s a long watch but it’s worth it. \n\n\nHunter x Hunter Nen x Impact has no release date or platforms as of yet.\n\nThe post Hunter x Hunter fighting game gets official title and teaser appeared first on Destructoid.",

We've known the event was in the works for a while now, but this is the first time we're seeing an actual release timeframe. The event will launch with the current expansion, Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker, ahead of the release of the new one Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail.\n\n\n\n\nPlayers will team up with Final Fantasy XVI protagonist Clive Rosfield in an exclusive event called The Path Infernal.

The team goes on to say that “due to the damages and other factors, we have decided to temporarily suspend the automatic demolition of estates”.\n\n\nHousing auto-demolition paused on Japanese Final Fantasy XIV servers\n\n\nIt’s not the first time that the FFXIV team has offered their support to players during tough times.

          "description": "All good Metroidvanias must eventually make their way to Nintendo Switch, and that's the next stop for GRIME. Publisher Akupara Games and developer Clover Bite announced that the side-scrolling action-RPG is coming to Switch on January 25. \n\n\n\n\nThis version of GRIME is now being billed as the Definitive Edition, offering \"the complete GRIME experience\" on Switch. In addition to the main game, the Switch port comes with all free pieces of DLC, including the third and final offering in Parting Shade. The latest addition follows the act of previous DLC Colors of Rot and Tinge of Terror, all evocatively named in a way that suits GRIME's, uh, grimy style. \n\n\nThe devs describe Parting Shade as their \"parting gift to you, our players.\" According to an earlier tease, you'll need to use every ability you have at your disposal to survive their own personal take on the Path of Pain, presumably referring to Hollow Knight's absurdly challenging sub-area. The DLC was first announced in September as the last thing they needed to work on before switching their attention to the Switch port and GRIME 2. \n\n\nGRIME first made its way to PC via Steam in August 2021, and is also available through Epic Games Store and GOG, as well as on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.

          "description": "Persona 3 Reload, a remake of 2006's Persona 3, just released its animated opening ahead of its February release. Not only does it look fantastic, but it pays homage to the game's original theme \"Burn My Dread\" in a pretty inventive way.\n\n\n\n\nMixing in the blue/white palette of the original, Persona 3 Reload’s opening movie gives us a taste of what to expect come February 2nd. The two-minute animation introduces us fully to the new song “Full Moon Full Life” sung by Azumi Takahashi and Lotus Juice. There are some subtle nods to the original 2006 phenomenon that long-time fans will adore.\n\n\nA Way of Life\n\n\nIf you’re like me and watched the opening more times than Akihiko says “I’ve been waiting for this!” (spoiler alert: it’s a ton), you’ll pick up on an audio Easter egg. Sure, there's the not-so-subtle usage of “Burn My Dread” and “Want to be Close” when the protagonist is flipping through his songs. However, the reference is in “Full Moon Full Life” itself. The beat of the song has a striking resemblance to the beginning notes of “Burn My Dread”. It’s a cool homage to the original banger of an opening. \n\n\nPersona 3 Reload’s opening visuals look phenomenal. I was a bit scared of how it would translate given the abstract tone of the original openings. However, it worked great and crafted some beautiful shots. It might just be me, but seeing Mitsuru riding her motorcycle like a badass got me 10x more hyped. Plus, the Akihiko/Shinjiro/Ken transitions were super smooth. A favorite shot of mine was with Thanatos and the moon, as it felt pretty iconic given the symbolism behind the two.\n\n\nOur very own Timothy Monbleau got to play Persona 3 Reload in August and said the game felt “polished to an absolute shine.” As one of my personal RPGs to look out for, Persona 3 Reload looks to be a force to be reckoned with. P3 Reload launches on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Game Pass, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on February 2, 2024.\n\nThe post Persona 3 Reload’s full opening is here to burn your dread appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It's been a funny old time for Cyberpunk 2077. Upon launching at the tail end of 2020, it went down as one of the most negatively received games due to its unfinished state. Now, with Phantom Liberty's launch and being one of the top-selling Steam releases of 2023, CD Projekt Red's dystopian RPG has finally arrived.\n\n\nSpeaking of top-selling, a recent post on the Cyberpunk Twitter page shows that a lot of people have downloaded the expansion. In fact, since it launched in September, Phantom Liberty has shifted more than five million units, according to the developer.\n\n\n\n\nAs user KAMI says in a response below the tweet, that's a mighty achievement for DLC. Entire games can only dream of achieving such lofty figures, especially in such a short span of time.\n\n\nCan we say it's fully redeemed now?\n\n\nThe memory of that initial launch is fast becoming faded, I reckon. Sure, folks like me felt massively let down by a product that was by no means ready for release. I was only really able to play it more than a year later.\n\n\nHowever, these days, it's a different story. The work CDPR put into rectifying as many errors and issues as possible has rendered the game worthy of praise. The fact that Phantom Liberty has been bought so many times is further evidence of this.\n\n\nAs we move forward, the studio is going to be busy, especially now that there are no more plans to release big updates for Cyberpunk 2077. We can only imagine what we'll experience when the follow-up arrives, not to mention the new Witcher saga that's currently in development.\n\nThe post Over five million people have purchased Phantom Liberty, CD Projekt Red says appeared first on Destructoid.",

The isometric strategy game is currently in Early Access on PC, and it's coming to PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch this June. \n\n\nDeveloper Supernature Games first kicked off the Early Access run on Steam back in September 2022, and it has since garnered very positive reviews. You can see a sample of its pixel art style and card-based tactics in the previously-revealed trailer below.\n\n\n\n\nLost in Fantaland lets players explore its randomly-generated world as a Warrior, Mage, or Deceiver. Battles take place on an eight-by-eight isometric checkerboard, and Supernature promises a ton of cards, items, and secret treasures to help keep those strategic showdowns interesting. For those who want to check it out while it's still in Early Access, Lost in Fantaland is currently 20 percent off on Steam. \n\n\nBeyond Fantaland\n\n\nIn addition to Lost in Fantaland, Game Source Entertainment provided some more info on games spanning a few different genres. Yasha: Legends of the Demon Blade is a roguelite fantasy action-RPG set during Japan's Edo period, and it's coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC this October. \n\n\nOn the boys' love visual novel end, there's Voice Love on Air, which developer Noisy Fish has lined up for a spring launch on Switch and PC. Finally, horror fans will get to soak in the frights of Softstar Entertainment's The Bridge Curse 2: The Extrication when it hits consoles, along with the previously-planned PC version, sometime this year. \n\nThe post Lost in Fantaland takes its deck-building tactics to PS5 and Switch in June appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "With the release of the Steam Deck OLED last year, Valve keeps its place as the head honcho of modern handheld PC technology. However, the market is starting to become crowded with alternatives, and one more tech firm is throwing its hat into the ring.\n\n\nAs spotted by The Verge, it looks as though multinational IT corporation MSI will be releasing its own Steam Deck competitor. That's according to leaked images, at least. In recent social media posts (originally reported by Videocardz), the company uploaded a teaser clip, showing something is certainly inbound from the laptop manufacturer.\n\n\n\n\nThere's also a message saying that a \"whole new breed of MSI dragon is coming,\" as well as instructions for us to \"get a grip and stay tuned.\" That last definitely hints at a handheld. In any case, details will be revealed at CES 2024 – judging by the hashtags – which begins next week.\n\n\nDeck the halls with - hmm, bit late for that pun\n\n\nIt looks as though this device – said to be called \"Claw\" – will run with an Intel Meteor Lake processor. Whether this is accurate or not can't be said at this stage, but the fact that Intel commented under MSI's Twitter tease hints that the tech giant is involved.\n\n\nWe've already seen the release of the Lenovo Legion GO, which came out last November, plus, the ASUS ROG Ally before that. Both of these have evidently been wanting to muscle in on the portable gaming market. Oh, also there's Sony's Project Q, which came out recently, but that's more in-line with console gaming than with PC.\n\n\nWhatever MSI has up its sleeve, it's clearly worth dropping hints about just before CES. And this recent leak seems to only cement the rumor. We'll know more about it sometime next week, but it's almost certain that that Valve will have another rival to contend with.\n\nThe post Steam Deck will have even more competition, this time from MSI appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Let's just get this out of the way: Valve is probably not going to make Portal 3 (boy is my face going to be red if I turn out to be wrong years from now). However, we can enjoy the fruits of the modding community that are keeping the franchise alive.\n\n\nOne such example comes from James Lambert, a coder who's just declared that their Portal 64 project is now out of beta. Or at least the first 13 chambers are, which is being referred to as the \"First Slice.\" You can download the project (in ROM form) in its current form here.\n\n\n\n\nIn the above video, Lambert goes over some of the things that have changed since the previous iterations. One of the more obvious ones is the higher polygon count for the portals themselves. There's also a lot of talk about Z-buffering, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\n\nThe flour-based sweet treat is most certainly not an untruth\n\n\nFor those who don't know, Portal 64 is essentially a remake of the first Portal game that Lambert has been working on for some time. It's essentially an attempt to recreate Valve's classic from the ground up to make it run on the Nintendo 64 hardware. A console that came out in the mid-90s.\n\n\nIn that regard, it's more of a \"demake.\" But the result is something pretty astounding, given the processing power that's being worked with.\n\n\nAlong the way, Lambert has built up quite a following. We get shown an N64 cartridge/game box combo that one fan has made, while another has customized a console with a Portal theme. Lambert also promises that more chambers will be added, so the project could end up being a full recreation of the entire game. With nostalgia a-plenty.\n\nThe post Portal 64 project now out of beta, with more to come appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A lot of people have been quite keen to know when they can get their hands on the remake of Silent Hill 2. So much so that developer Bloober Team urged for a bit more patience, and we still have no idea when it's releasing. But we're getting closer.\n\n\nIn a recent video on the PlayStation YouTube channel, we're treated to a brief teaser showing what we can expect to launch this year on Sony's system. Among other things (something called \"Tek-en,\" not sure if you've heard of it), we're now told that Silent Hill 2 will be available this year.\n\n\n\n\nOf course, we could probably have ascertained that 2024 was likely the release window. But it's comforting to see PlayStation officially acknowledge this. However, we don't have an actual date yet, so that's surely the next port of call.\n\n\nWe must be nearly there, then\n\n\nMany of us had been hoping to see the remake by the end of 2023 at the latest. For some time, it's been suggested that Bloober was just putting the finishing touches to the game, and this teaser sort of confirms that the team must be at the final hurdle now.\n\n\nAfter the disappointment that was the interactive experience Silent Hill: Ascension, the legendary series could do with a win. Konami's horror franchise has been dormant for far too long, some might say. Me. I would say that.\n\n\nHowever, there's a lot to live up to. Bloober Team has its critics, and bringing back Silent Hill 2 – with the original being largely considered one of the most influential horror games of all time – is a tall order, indeed.\n\nThe post Silent Hill 2 seemingly gets a 2024 launch window in a recent PlayStation video appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The VR gaming realm appears to be struggling to gain its footing as yet another studio experiences problems. This time around it's Archiact which has announced it is going through layoffs. \n\n\nArchiact describes itself as \"one of the largest independent VR studios\" and it is behind VR titles like Doom 3: VR Edition, Freedriver: Triton Down, and Marvel Dimension of Heroes.  One of the latest titles it has released is Journey to Foundation which is inspired by Isaac Asimov's series. \n\n\n\n\nA reason for the layoffs was not given in the announcement, though it's stated that it wasn't an easy process. Archiact also asks for any fellow studios to reach out if they are hiring in numerous fields, which offers a glimpse at how many departments the layoffs affected, from Art and Animation to Engineering. \n\n\nArchiact doesn't struggle alone, as First Contact Entertainment has announced its closure. According to the developer, the closure was a product of a lack of \"lack of support for VR within the industry.\" This is a notable event for VR players, as the studio was one of the leaders when it comes to AAA VR experiences, as seen in titles such as Firewall Ultra. \n\n\nVR continues to be a tricky platform to master, even for companies as massive as Sony. Fortunately, those who enjoy the gaming experience aren't left without any new titles, as games like RE 4 Remake's VR mode and Tiger Blade continue to ensure VR libraries are never entirely empty. \n\nThe post Studio behind Doom 3 VR announces layoffs appeared first on Destructoid.",

While it’s still early in development, things look to be progressing well on the title.\n\n\nIf you’re unfamiliar, Buck Up and Drive, it’s similar to Out Run if it was taken to its furthest extremes. You not only race against time, but you also flip the hell out, performing absurd stunts that look like your car got stuck in the level geometry, and the physics don't know how to cope. There’s also drifting and rail-grinding, the normal sort of thing you’d expect from a racing game. It was part of my list of 2021 games you might have missed, which is what I did before just making the usual top 10 list every year.\n\n\n\n\nBuck Up and Drive 2 looks to be expanding on that. I’m not sure how that’s possible, but Fábio Fontes obviously has the answer: driving on walls. Do you remember the Spider-Mobile from the 1970’s Spider-Man comics? It’s a lot like that but less dumb. Also shown off is character customization. I’m not sure why, but I’ll take it.\n\n\nBuck Up and Drive 2 is built in the Godot Engine, probably because Fontes had a falling out with the GameMaker Engine following their move to a subscription model. Thankfully, the billboards have returned for the sequel. Some players complained about the original game’s common use of pride flags as billboards, so in response, Fontes added a “Pride Flag Billboard Toggle.” When toggled, it simply adds more pride flags. Respect.\n\n\nBuck Up and Drive 2 is coming to PC. There is no stated release window, as it is still early in development.\n\nThe post Buck Up and Drive 2 looks to be shaping up nicely, lets you drive on walls appeared first on Destructoid.",

In the meantime, a demo that includes three tracks will be available on Steam starting January 11.\n\n\n\n\nI knew these games as Top Gear. It was hard not to look at it as a kid since the cover features a car (possibly) driving away from an explosion. It was similar to Race Drivin’ in terms of its eye-catching cover, but unlike Race Drivin’, Top Gear is actually a decent series.\n\n\nCreated by Gremlin Games Studios, the series started out on 16-bit consoles as racing games that use a raster effect to depict a 3D-like road. It distinguishes itself from games like Out Run by having tracks that actually circle back on themselves, which was uncommon for the particular sub-genre. It also had more of a tournament racing feel with pitstops and ongoing rankings. It also had split-screen multi-player, kind of like Outrunners on Genesis, but not as terrible.\n\n\nThough Top Gear 2 was ported to other platforms, the series stayed faithful to Nintendo platforms for a long time. After three games on the SNES, the series shifted to N64, with Boss Studios and Midway handling Top Gear Rally.\n\n\nTop Racer Collection assembles Top Racer (Gear), Top Racer 2, and Top Racer 3000 into one package. On top of that, they’re including Top Racer Crossroads, which is a new title that features four new cars, including one that is plainly the Ferrari Testarossa featured in Out Run.

Also, streams of this nature are not present on the homepage.\n\n\nAs for the update to the attire policy, Twitch has made it clear that it does not want streamers to be presenting themselves with \"implied nudity.\" The post states that such content will have its label changed to a more appropriate one, while repeat offenses will \"lead to an enforcement action.\"\n\nThe post Twitch’s updated policy is cracking down on ‘implied nudity’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

The composer has also announced that plans to bring it to modern consoles are underway.\n\n\n\n\nEarthion is a scrolling shoot-’em-up in development for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. While that is not entirely unique in these days of homebrew development, what makes Earthion special is that it’s being helmed by Yuzo Koshiro, the legendary composer behind games such as Streets of Rage and Revenge of Shinobi. While he did compositions for SNES games like Actraiser, Robotrek, and Super Adventure Island, he’s perhaps best known for his Genesis contributions. His company, Ancient Corp, beyond collaborating with other developers, also created Beyond Oasis for the console.\n\n\nThe company has been tinkering with Earthion as far back as 2022, with its big reveal happening at Tokyo Game Show 2023. There, Ancient demonstrated the game’s tremendous bosses and fancy scaling effects.\n\n\nWhile Koshiro has moved on to composing for modern platforms with games such as the Etrian Odyssey series, he hasn’t lost his appreciation for old hardware. For Ancient’s recent game, Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness, there’s a suite of DLC available that changes the soundtrack to versions arranged for various consoles. This includes not only PC-88 and Mega Drive platforms but even less common consoles such as the Wonderswan. It feels very fitting that his company would eventually go back and create and new game for an old console.\n\n\nEarthion is aiming for a Summer 2024 release (at the earliest) on Genesis/Mega Drive. Modern console versions are planned, but none have been confirmed.

One of the latest Xbox redesigns comes in the form of a Series S toaster that you can pick up at Walmart. \n\n\nWe got our first glimpses last year when a French Twitter account posted images of the toaster along with its specs. It's now finally available for purchase, and it does everything you would want from a two-slice toaster, including a six-setting shade selector dial to get your toast just right. \n\n\nWith a wide slot, it can sort out your artisan loaf bread slices, \"bagels, frozen waffles, Texas toast, or English muffins.\" It also has an anti-jam function and as an attractive bonus, it also can imprint the Xbox sphere logo on your bread. To keep things from getting messy, you'll also get a removable crumb tray and non-stick-coated plates. \n\n\nSome high-tech features include a digital LED countdown timer as well as the ability to keep a list of the different preferred settings of household members. At $39.99, it's not out of reach for the sufficiently motivated Xbox fan. \n\n\nTo complete the Xboxification of your life, throw in the Xbox Mastercard as well as the Wonka-inspired console and controller. \n\nThe post Xbox Series S toaster available at Walmart appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "In 2020, the Yakuza series took a bit of a leap with its seventh entry, Yakuza: Like a Dragon. The lens shifted away from longtime series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu to newcomer Kasuga Ichiban, swapping out its real-time action for turn-based RPG combat in the process. It was, by most accounts, a rousing success. But there was still room to grow.\n\n\nLike a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, then, seems like even more like a passing of the torch than its predecessor. And it was this shared custody of the spotlight that made me a bit nervous, going into a preview session way back in October. How would the focus manage both Kiryu and Ichiban? Why, after seeing one character hand the reins to the next, did we need to retread that ground?\n\n\n\n\nAfter playing a hefty amount of Infinite Wealth, it seems like Ryu…",

The transition from pixel art to fully animated computer graphics was a massive enough leap ahead, but the beauty of this classic title was much more than skin deep. Final Fantasy VII features an incredible cast of characters, an outstanding battle system, and a story that evokes joy, awe, anger, and grief. Final Fantasy VII is well-established as one of the most iconic and beloved video games of all time, but for Square Enix, the legacy is somewhat more important. \nFor the team behind the Final Fantasy franchise, Final Fantasy VII was the entry that made the developers realize they needed to adapt to the times. \"Even within the mainline Final Fantasy titles as a series, we can co…",

Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days.

If you've ever played a Persona game, you're likely familiar with the \"opening movie,\" which is the awesome animated opening to the game set to what is typically the main theme song. Ahead of Persona 3 Reload's release next month, Atlus has released its opening movie, debuting a brand new track called \"Full Moon Full Life.\" \nIn it, we get a look at the main character and the rest of the cast, as well as Persona, Igor, and more. As you might expect, the opening movie retains the flashy and stylish animation Persona has become known for over the years, and no surprise, it looks great. Atlus notes the trailer contains violent and sensitive content, however, so be wary of that before pressing play. \nCheck out the Persona 3 Reload opening movie for yourself below: \n\n\nFor more about the game, check out Game Informer's hands-on preview of Persona 3 Reload and then read Game Informer's list of all upcoming video game remakes.

It was an innovative, well-regarded, but underplayed game about landing on an alien planet and trying to survive in the face of its dangerous fauna. A remake of that game, called Outcast: Second Contact, was released in 2017, but Outcast: A New Beginning is the long overdue, proper sequel to the cult classic.\nJoin Marcus Stewart and me as we check out what the game has to offer, which is primarily impressive jetpack mechanics that let you literally fly around the alien world at high speeds.

          "description": "PlayStation has released a promotional video highlighting some of the biggest games coming to its console this year. The video hypes both first and third-party releases, many of which already had release dates/windows, but it also casually confirms 2024 launches for two previously un-dated projects.\nSpecifically, the video labels Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Silent Hill 2 as 2024 games. Both games, each a remake of their respective titles, had no launch window prior to today. But the video and the accompanying PlayStation Blog post confirm as much, which is a little surprising to see happen with relatively limited fanfare instead of Konami rolling out individual red carpets for each game's launch update. But if you're looking forward to playing either title, this is welcomed news nonetheless.\n\n\nSilent Hill 2 was announced in 2022 as a remake of the 2001 classic and is being developed by Bloober Team. The studio recently shared that work on the game was “progressing smoothly”, and it is a PlayStation 5 console exclusive (but will also launch on PC). \nMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a Unreal Engine 5 remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. It was announced during a PlayStation Showcase last May, and Konami released its first in-engine gameplay footage last October. Despite its inclusion in today’s PlayStation video, Snake Eater is also coming to Xbox Series X/S and PC.",

Bread will never be the same again. \nFeast your eyes on the officially licensed Series S toaster, which is on sale now at Walmart. The novelty appliance boasts a wide slot to toast thick slices of bread, bagels, waffles, English muffins, and probably most PlayStation discs for the truly devoted. In a neat twist, the oven roasts the Xbox logo on the food itself to add a flavorful touch of corporate branding to your carb intake. \n\nThe toaster also sports a digital LED countdown timer, a six-setting shade selector dial for browning customization, a removable crumb tray, automatic temperature control, and a cool-touch exterior, among other perks. Though a cool appliance, I can’t help but wonder how many people will request a Series S as a gift from friends/family and receive this elaborately disguised kitchen accessory instead. \nThose interested can purchase the Xbox Series S toaster for $39.99.",

U.S.-based 13-year-old Willis Gibson just beat an unbeatable Tetris game that players have been attempting to complete since its release on the NES in 1989. \nOn January 1, Gibson reached level 157 of Tetris, a feat previously thought impossible. New techniques, like the \"hypertapping\" one discovered in 2010 by Thor Aackerlund (thanks, BBC), and \"rolling,\" discovered in 2021 according to IGN, allowed players to reach never before seen levels. Before that, getting past the thirties was all but impossible and now, Gibson has made it to level 157. As you can see in the video below, upon reaching that level, Tetris serves Gibson a kill screen – meaning it has crashed – ending his impossible run. \n\n\nIt took Gibson, who goes by Blue Scuti on YouTube, 38 minutes to reach this new kill screen. BBC reports that Gibson has been playing Tetris for about two years, or since he was 11. Alongside his achievement of reaching level 157, Gibson also obtained the new highest score for Tetris. \nIGN writes that players can theoretically make it to level 255, and players are already trying; they just have to get lucky and avoid the crash points from level 157 onward. Upon beating level 255, players are brought back to the first level. \nFor more, be sure to watch Gibson beat the record here, and then read about these Game Informer editors who beat six gaming world records. \n[Source: BBC, IGN]\nAre there any video game records you think you could beat?

This stands in stark contrast to his fate in the original continuity, where he was killed and his Buster Sword was handed over to Cloud. \nZack's changed fate is emblematic of how the Final Fantasy VII Remake and Rebirth teams approached the source material. \"If we trace the original and stay exactly loyal to it a…",

And just like when the film Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey took advantage of that whimsical character entering the public domain, someone has already started making a twisted, horrifying version of Mickey. In this case, it’s a video game.\nIt’s called Infestation: Origins, and it’s the debut title by Nightmare Forge Games. The game is an episodic four-player co-op survival adventure in which players control exterminators tasked with killing mutated vermin – and one of them happens to be a terrifying, person-sized monster modeled after Mickey.

Ubisoft also confirmed to Kotaku that, \"the timing was incorrect and has since been amended.\" So, Star Wars Outlaws' release window has moved from late 2024 back to some general time this year.\nOriginal story:\nStar Wars Outlaws, Ubisoft's upcoming open-world Star Wars game, has enjoyed a vague 2024 release window since it was revealed at an Xbox Showcase last year. However, a recent post on Disney's official park blog has given the game a more specific window. According to the blog, Star Wars Outlaws is releasing late 2024. The blog post, which is a collection of 24 exciting Disney-things happening in 2024 reads, \"And for Star Wars fans – Star Wars Outlaws, the open-world Star Wars game is set to release late this year.\"\nStar Wars Outlaws follows an original Star Wars character named Kay Vess and seeks to explore a character archetype of the Star Wars universe we haven't spent much time with in video games: the Han Solo-inspired scoundrel. In the game, Vess (who has no Jedi abilities as far as we know) must survive by her wits and her ability to talk (or blast) her way through difficult situations.\nFor more on Star Wars Outlaws, you can read our interview with the game's narrative director, Navid Khavari, where we covered topics like whether or not the game will have an overlap with Shadows of the Empire and if the team has been communicating with Respawn regarding its Jedi series of games. The game is planned for release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

The 2008 Prince of Persia reboot didn’t reignite the series as Ubisoft had hoped, and 2010’s Forgotten Sands felt closer to a movie tie-in than a new, proper entry.\nThat game’s subtitle would end up being a portend of the future as the series seemed inexplicably lost to time.

In no time, the once billion-dollar industry was reduced to rubble.\nIn the summer of that same year, in Japan, gaming giant Nintendo released its first-ever home console with swappable cartridges.

It's literally my job to play video games and I bet someone could fill a reasonable top ten this year of titles I didn't even get time to touch. But even as it's a universal, undeniable truth, the revelation that you missed out on something popular is always met with the same incredulous statement.\n“You've never played this?”\nI understand the impulse. For instance, Baldur's Gate 3 took up so many hours of my 2023 that it's hard to fathom what the year would be like without it. This sentiment extends well beyond GOTY talks, though – some games are so fundamental to our taste or upbringing that it can be hard to process that peop…",

It was a fantastic year for gamers at home with great tentpole releases from PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo, and some excellent indies, too. For years to come, we will all likely argue that 2023 was one of the best – if not the best – year for games. But it was also a terrible year for the people who make games, with more than 10,000 developers laid off, studios closed, and more. \nBetween big video game releases, a heartbreaking amount of layoffs, record-breaking acquisitions and box office reports, and more, 2023 contained plenty of news stories that had us talking for weeks, speculating on the future of the industry, and reshaping how we view game development.

While he thought it dragged on a bit in the second half, our reviewer said, \"Calling Requiem a standard sequel is a disservice; Asobo has created a Plague Tale epic.\" You can read that full review here and take a look at the other two offerings below.\nThe other two games are Evil West and Nobody Saves the World, each also released in 2022. Evil West is a third-person shooter set in a world that's a fusion between a classic Wild West and gothic horror and one that reminded one of our editors of his time as a kid playing Darkwatch. Meanwhile, Nobody Saves the World is about a shapeshifting Nobody (yeah, that's his name) on a quest to find the wizard who can stop a fungal infection from overtaking the world. Written by John Carson, the Game Informer review reads, \"Despite its minor shortcomings, Nobody Saves the World kept me enthralled from start to finish.\"D All three games will be available to download on January 2.\nAnd as always, as the new comes in, the old must go; subscribers will have until January 1 to download the current crop of PS Plus games, which includes Lego 2K Drive, Powerwash Simulator, and Sable.\nAre you excited to check out any of January's PS Plus Games?
