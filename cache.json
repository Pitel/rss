Developer Whatnot Games has revealed Star Racer, a retro sci-fi racing game that takes inspiration from F-Zero and Star Fox. If that's not all, it also boasts the musical talent of Grant Kirkhope, famous for his work on classics like Banjo-Kazooie and GoldenEye 007.\nThe game is currently being funded via Kickstarter, with a Switch version earmarked as a stretch goal, so if this one looks like it's up your street, you might want to consider backing it sooner rather than later. At first glance, Star Racer looks very similar to F-Zero (which is not a bad thing in our books), with multiple pixel-art sprite vehicles zooming around elaborate tracks. You can battle with your opponents using a familiar circling ground attack, or you can engage your inner Star Fox and launch an aerial assault.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

In the case of my multiplayer hands-on, that empire was the Ix'Idar, a race of burrowing insect critters with a unique resource - pheromones. Boldly disregarding the PR's gentle advice that I start with an easier-to-master race, I set out to swarm the galaxy and immediately found myself at the bottom of the victory or \"Succession\" point scoreboard, with one player picking off my planets by means of espionage, while others stomped my fleets of stargrubs flat in no-nonsense space combat. \r\n\n\r\nI did manage to briefly take possession of the titular Nexus, a throneworld which awards beaucoup Succession points to its owner, but it turns out fixating on the Nexus is a great way to set yourself up for a midgame dogpile - you pour resources into capturing it, sacrifice half your fleet to the first invader, then lose it all to the second. With my initially bountiful dominions rudely shrunk to a smattering of isolated planets, I took the coward's way out of the press event and said I had to be going because I had other work to attend to. I didn't at all! I just wanted to go and cry in the toilet. Alas for the Ix'Idar - not so much \"lions led by donkeys\" as an antfarm in the hands of a wilful toddler.\r\n\n \nRead more",

In Owlcat's forthcoming RPG Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, you play the free-wheeling head of an interstellar merchant's dynasty. Operating on the fringes of uncharted space, you're the owner of a Warrant of Trade that essentially lets you run your own miniature empire within the Imperium, deciding the fates of planets, amassing vast wealth and recruiting a motley crew of xenos, heretics and assorted weirdos. It's the kind of behaviour that'd get you vaporised if you were some run-of-the-mill Space Marine Chaplain, but out here on the frontier, you're allowed to act with impunity, providing you fulfil your overall mandate of adding to the God Emperor's glory and kicking the odd Eldar's head in.\r\n\n\r\nRogue Traders are arguably the only characters in Games Workshop's brutal and decrepit table-top setting that lend themselves to the role of CRPG protagonist, because they are the only characters in Warhammer 40K's Imperium who enjoy anything like the plot agency of a Commander Shepard. And with that, I think, comes an interesting transformation of the character alignment systems the game shares with other CRPGs such as Baldur's Gate 3.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The indie hit somehow melded fishing with cosmic horror - seamlessly - to create an enthralling adventure where you can never be sure if what you're about to haul out of the depths will have a normal amount of eyes or tentacles. The new Pale Reach DLC gets even weirder, a masterpiece of show-don’t-tell horror that manages to evoke some of the more inspired Bloodborne monsters as well as some of icy, supernatural scares from The Terror. And it's all centred on a big whale. \r\n\n\r\nSpoilers ahead, friends, but in The Pale Reach, a massive icy landscape has suddenly appeared in the southern, well, reaches of Dredge's world, so naturally we’re off to see what that’s all about, ploughing along in our faithful fishing boat to the hostile new climate. Every path into the landmass is barricaded by imposing ice walls. It's a slog.\r\n\n\r\nIt’s also a great setup. We're made to instantly wonder what the hell hides in this treacherous ice field, and the answer is equally great: a massive corrupted narwhal with bulbous glowing eyes. The huge beast dwarfs your tiny ship, but mercifully it’s frozen solid in an even bigger chunk of ice, with only those very angry eyes poking out at us. Four angry eyes on one side of its head, to be very precise.\n Read more",

It's the work of former Hi-Rez subsidiary and nowadays independent studio Prophecy Games, and going by SteamDB listings, it's called Tribes 3: Rivals.\nNew to the Tribes series? It once went by the unofficial title of \"the world's fastest shooter\". On the one hand, I'm not sure that claim holds as true in the era of Titanfall 2 or DOOM Eternal or Hyper Demon or heck, even latter-day Fortnite with its rocket-powered rams. On the other hand, and to pick up the tune from Matt Cox's (RPS in peace) 2019 retrospective - WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. Here's a compilation of footage from a recent playtest.\nRead more",

          "description": "In another lifetime, SteamWorld Dig could have easily ended up as SteamWorld Build. When Image & Form first released their 2D digging platformer back in the depths of 2013, its moreish loop of carving out rocky chasms, finding gems and treasure, then upgrading your pickaxe and burgeoning township back on the surface was instantly captivating, and its 2017 sequel continues to be one of my favourite platformers of all time. Now, a decade later, SteamWorld Build has reimagined Dig's core ideas as a handsome citybuilder, placing equal focus on managing your rustbucket town up top, while plundering its depths via an abandoned mineshaft to find treasure, resources and (most importantly) rocket parts, so you can escape your crumbling planet and find a new homestead up in the stars.\nDespite the threat of annihilation hanging over the horizon, however, SteamWorld Build is one of the most relaxed and easy-going building games I've ever played. This is a game that's more concerned with keeping your economy running like a well-oiled, uhh, machine than turning a profit, for example, and it merely dips its toe in the genre's wider, ongoing obsession with building up defences to fend off oncoming hordes of malicious town hall-eating nasties. If the scales do get thrown out of equilibrium, the worst that will happen is you get lots of angry little red robot faces appearing above your houses. You won't go bankrupt, you won't get turfed out for being incompetent, and you definitely won't see any kind of game over screen if the aforementioned nasties end up running amok in your mining levels. The stakes, then, are quite low, which is probably a good indication of whether you'll get on with SteamWorld Build, and how much you'll get out of it.\nRead more",

AMD's Ryzen 5 5600X processor is available for just either side of half-price, depending on which side of the pond you live on. Regardless, that's a big chunk off one of the best gaming CPUs around.\r\n\n\r\nWhen Katharine reviewed the 5600X back in 2020, she called it \"a stonkingly fast gaming CPU\". It's a six-core, twelve thread processor, with each of its Vermeer processors providing speedy single-core performance, making it an ideal CPU for playing both modern multithreaded games, and older single-thread titles. There are of course plenty of faster CPUs around these days, but you'll pay significantly more for those, and it's only prudent to do so if you're looking to get the highest framerates at 1080p. If you're gaming at 4k, then it's your GPU that'll be doing most of the heavy lifting, and your funds are better spent there.\r\n\n\r\nIt's also worth noting that the 5600X is highly power efficient, with a TDP of just 65 watts. This makes it both more economical and more environmentally friendly that a lot of CPUs, an important consideration if your energy bills are making you wince.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "If you’re someone who struggles with desk space, a tenkeyless keyboard could be a useful way to maximise your desktop area. By slicing off the rarely used numpad keys, a TKL board gives you a little extra room to wiggle your mouse, or actually put a cup of coffee to one side rather than jamming it somewhere between your keyboard and your monitor. The only problem with TKL boards is they tend to be slightly more expensive than their bulkier counterparts, meaning you often end up paying extra money for less keyboard overall. But if you are in the market for a slimmer typing solution, then right now you can get £100 off one of the best TKL keyboards this Black Friday.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's a repeated task with a touch of variation from cycle to cycle, typically associated with a character progression system of some kind. The classic one is the town-dungeon loop in an action-RPG such as Diablo 4. You sally forth into the depths with sword and shield, slaughter a bunch of blameless goblins, then orbit triumphantly back to the village square with its 24/7 forge and bustling adventurer's guild. Then off you go, once again, with a Sword +1 and a shield now bearing a Goblin Magnet. There are straightforward equivalents in multiplayer, especially in the wake of Call Of Duty 4: Modern Warfare - sign in, play a few matches, harvest some XP, unlock a new laser sight, equip it, play a few more matches with +5% to your aim.\r\n\n \nRead more",

But there is one last torchbearer of the budget GPU, and weirdly enough that's Intel. If you happen to live in the US, then you can get your hands on the best cheap 1080p  graphics card for a smidge more than $200 for Black Friday.\r\n\n\r\nNow I know the idea of Intel making graphics cards sounds almost as preposterous as horses with horns, but they've been at it for a while. Granted, they've not been especially good at it for most of that time. The original launch of the Arc series was pretty disappointing. But Intel have worked to imrprove the performance of their GPUs, and now the Arc A750 is an excellent 1080p offering.\r\n\n\r\nIt's also a perfectly acceptable card for those looking to make their first-steps into the world of Ray-tracing. As James notes in his review \"if you’re specifically looking to try ray tracing on the cheap, know that the Arc A750 turns the tables on the RX 6650 XT with these kinds of settings. Where the A750 produced 47fps in Hitman, the RX 6650 XT could only manage 29fps, an even steeper drop from its respective rasterised performance.\"\r\n \nRead more",

In my multiplayer review, I say that it preys on nostalgia, because it does! The game's multiplayer schtick is all about bringing back classic maps to act as a smokescreen for a lack of direction. At least, that's what I think.\nI find all this nostalgia stuff interesting, mainly because it's coincided with three other events in my own personal timeline (Chapter 29 Season 11, you could say): A League Of Legends pro-player called Faker, the resurgence of a badminton star, and Fortnite's own OG event. The thing that separates them all from COD? A plan.\nRead more",

          "description": "Both the Steam Deck and Steam Deck OLED come bundled with cases – new and improved ones, if you get a 1TB OLED – so it wouldn’t initially make sense to invest in a third-party one. But Steam Deck accessories can take many forms, and I’ve been particularly convinced by the case style that combines a space-saving protective skin with a tougher removeable cover. Since the Dbrand Project Killswitch isn’t playing Black Friday ball, it falls to my other favourite, JSAUX’s ModCase, to provide the bargains.\r\n\n\r\nIt works thusly: instead of taking your Steam Deck in and out of a zip-up sarcophagus every time you want to play it on the move, you simply leave the handheld wrapped in the ModCase’s snug, rubbery skin, simultaneously protecting it and adding grip as you hold it. The front cover simply snaps on and off as needed. It’s a lighter, more compact alternative to a full case that, I can say from experience, absolutely shields the precious Deck effectively enough for everyday bag duty. As the name suggests, it’s modular as well, so you can mount other accessories (like kickstands, power banks and even a secondary cooling fan) to the back of the skin.\r\n\n\r\nJust want the case? No bother, that’s down from $30 from $26. There’s no UK version of the JSAUX store, unfortunately, though JSAUX ships internationally. Just click through the link below, and select which kit you'd like.\r\n \nRead more",

Maybe not to the standards of its successor, the Crucial T500, but this is still a competitively quick-acting drive with oodles of space for game installations. The same goes for its heatsink-equipped edition, which also happens to be on sale in the US at $88, making it (currently) cheaper than the non-heatsink 2TB model.

However, if you're sick of wheels of cheese and shiny, green apples, a couple of people have made it possible to eat something far more enjoyable.\n\n\nIf you've got that craving for some in-game pizza, hrodeberht1 and bella over on Nexus Mods may have just what you need. Their \"Necro Pizza Cyrodiil\" mod adds in a delivery service that gives you the option to order your character a hot, cheesy dish of the good stuff.\n\n\n\n\nThe above video shows how it works. Basically, it adds a pizza menu to your inventory where you get to pick from six different types of 'za (that's right, I said it). Upon placing the order, your food is sent to you by a Necromancer, where it's delivered by a skeleton who proclaims the delivery complete upon receiving it.\n\n\nShame it's not real\n\n\nThis is actually similar to another mod they did back in 2021 which allows the Dragonborn to order a pizza while roaming around in – you guessed it – Skyrim. There's also this one from a different modder that allows you to order a real pizza directly through Oblivion. So...pizza is very much something that's been missing in The Elder Scrolls this whole time.\n\n\nWhile at this point many would now consider it quite an old game, The Elder Scrolls 4 is an absolute classic in Bethesda's long-running series.\n\n\nHowever, if you want a way of playing a more up-to-date version of Oblivion, there is an unofficial remake called Skyblivion that's currently in the works. However, that's not due out until probably 2025, so you've definitely got time to grab some pizza while you wait.\n\nThe post Get a hot pizza delivered to your Oblivion character with this mod appeared first on Destructoid.",

Given their track record, all signs point to \"?\" That's coming out on December 1, if you somehow haven't played this series at all yet. As a reminder, the trilogy comes with Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Arkham Knight - and the latter dropped in 2015.

They knew that the N64 trilogy (if you exclude the multiplayer-focused Turok: Rage Wars) had to be completed.\n\n\nIt couldn’t have been an easy task. While Turok: Dinosaur Hunter and Turok 2: Seeds of Evil had PC versions they could pluck from, Turok 3 remained exclusive to the N64. Thankfully, Nightdive’s wizardry has only become more potent over the years, and because of their work porting other N64 games like Doom 64 and Quake 2 (64) to their proprietary KEX Engine, they were able to reverse engineer Turok 3 to save it from the suffocating tomb of the console that birthed it.\n\n\nStill, it’s a damned weird game.\n\n\nScreensh…",

          "description": "Dan Houser left an unerasable mark on gaming through his work at Rockstar, though he has since moved on to new projects. This includes two new IPs his entertainment company is working on. \n\n\nYou shouldn't expect traditional gaming experiences from Absurd Ventures. The first IP, American Caper, focuses on two families facing a world of \"corrupt business, inept politics and bungling crime.\" We'll explore this universe through a graphic novel illustrated by comic book artist Simon Bisley. The first story arrives in 2024. \n\n\nA Better Paradise is the second IP. It's an existential suspense thriller being made with help from Q-CODE Media. Interestingly, it'll take the form of a 12-episode audio fiction series. It also arrives in 2024. \n\n\nImage via Absurd Ventures.\n\n\nDan Houser and Absurd Ventures\n\n\nHouser is a co-founder of Rockstar and has served as a writer for the Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption franchises. He left the company in 2020 before starting Absurd Ventures in 2021. We haven't seen much from the business yet and the official site doesn't offer much guidance, featuring little but some cryptic images and many-sided dice with provocative terms on them. \n\n\nThere are other projects in store from the entertainment company, as it intends to bring more stories from American Caper and A Better Paradise to a wide range of formats and platforms. Commenting on the IPs, Houser states that this is just the beginning, and the initial releases will allow them to introduce the two universes while \"working on other iterations and expansions.\"\n\n\nThough Houser may have left Rockstar, it seems crass humor and depictions of American society are a constant in everything he touches. I'm interested to see how Absurd Ventures will use varied mediums for creative storytelling. \n\nThe post Dan Houser’s Absurd Ventures  has two new IPs on the way appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s easily Niantic’s best game since Pokemon GO, and with the game’s first major update on the horizon, it’s looking like the title will stay relevant heading into 2024.\n\n\nFor those just tuning in, Monster Hunter Now is a GPS driven augmented-reality game based on Capcom’s Monster Hunter series. While this seems like an odd pitch, it’s an entertaining concept that stays remarkably true to its source material. Though the combat naturally makes concessions to play smoothly on touch screens, Niantic’s take on the formula does appear to have resonated with players since launch.\n\n\n\nThat said, there’s certainly room for improvement here in a lot of ways, wh…",

Professor Layton and the New World of Steam hits Nintendo Switch sometime in 2025, and a you can watch as Layton and Luke work out a puzzle in the latest trailer. \n\n\n\n\nAs shown in the preview, Yo Oizumi is back leading the Japanese cast as Layton, with Mio Imada now voicing Luke Triton. Maki Horikita previously voiced Luke prior to retiring from the entertainment industry back in 2017 to focus on her family. \n\n\nThe sample brainteaser has Layton and Luke attempting to find the entrance to the workshop of a genius inventor named Eggmuffin. Frankly, not working \"Eggmuffin\" somewhere into the title is the pinnacle of burying the lede. Eggmuffin's workshop is but one quirky building amidst the wider world of Steam Bison, an American town that advances as you continue to find and solve puzzles.\n\n\nIt's been a while since Layton and Luke went on a proper adventure together. At this point Luke has made somewhat of a name for himself as a detective, while puzzle master Layton continues working as Professor of Archeology at Gressenheller University. Their latest outing is officially underway when a \"mysterious incident\" occurs in Steam Bison. I'm just tickled at the way Steam Bison works as both a really cool town name and a scrapped Mega Man X boss. \n\n\nI'm already stumped\n\n\nThis time around, puzzle design duties fall to famed Japanese puzzle design team QuizKnock. As the official Layton site notes, the team that Takuji Izawa runs specializes in combining entertainment with knowledge. As of right now they have over 2 million subscribers to their YouTube channel. We'll have to wait until 2025 to see just how thoroughly they can twist our noggins like the pliable pretzels they are. \n\nThe post Professor Layton and the New World of Steam sets 2025 release window, shows off puzzle appeared first on Destructoid.",

But you'd be crazy if you thought that would be the end of the immensely successful anime series. Pokémon Horizons is on the way to pick up the mantle, with Netflix confirming in a new trailer that it will begin airing stateside early next year. \n\n\nPokémon Horizons features a new duo of Liko and Roy, each with a starter from the Paldea region. Liko is paired with the grass-type Sprigatito, while Roy adventures around with the fire-type Fuecoco. The trailer introduces us to Liko and explains she has traveled to where it all began, the Kanto region, to enroll in the Indigo Academy. We also meet Roy, a young native of the Kanto region with a passion for becoming a Pokémon trainer. Sound familiar?\n\n\n\n\nLiko and Roy both possess artifacts that the Explorers, the Team Rocket-like group of Horizons, are seeking to take. Liko has a mysterious pendant passed down to her from her grandmother. While Roy has an ancient-looking Poké Ball that raises questions of its own.\n\n\nThe duo isn't alone though, as a group known as the Rising Volt Tacklers come to their aid in the show. The group is headlined by its own duo of Friede and Captain Pikachu, with Friede riding atop a fierce-looking Charizard of his own. \n\n\nThe series will start streaming on Netflix beginning February 23, 2024, which purposely coincides with the timing of Pokémon Day celebrations for 2024. \n\n\nPokémon Horizons isn't the only Pokémon series Netflix has coming down the pipeline though, as the fantastic-looking stop-motion animated Pokémon Concierge begins streaming on December 28. \n\nThe post Pokémon Horizons premieres on Netflix in February appeared first on Destructoid.",

With these closures, can't blame fans for considering stopping their investment in Square Enix mobile titles. \n\n\nDespite so many shutdowns, Square Enix still plans to release Kingdom Hearts: Missing Link in 2024.

          "description": "Fans excited for Sonic the Hedgehog 3 got a nice little tease today. Jeff Fowler, director of both 2020's Sonic the Hedgehog and 2022's Sonic the Hedgehog 2, published a tweet today teasing the emergence of one of the blue blur's most iconic villains, Shadow the Hedgehog in next year's Sonic the Hedgehog 3.\n\n\nThe point of the tweet was twofold. Fowler shared an image teasing the lower half of Sonic's genetically engineered rival, but also confirmed that Sonic the Hedgehog 3 was \"off and running\" with development. \n\n\n\n\nShadow the Hedgehog was revealed as a tease during the conclusion of Sonic the Hedgehog 2. While his team was searching for Dr. Robotnik, G.U.N. Commander Walters was informed that a 50-year-old file was found that contained coordinates to a secret site hosting something called \"Project: Shadow\". We then see the black hedgehog open his angry eyes within a containment cell. The background of the image Fowler posted today looks to be that very same site. \n\n\nShadow the Hedgehog originally debuted as a foil to Sonic in the Sega Dreamcast's Sonic Adventure 2. Due to the character's popularity, he became a series mainstay, acting as an anti-hero of sorts who strives to do good but by any means necessary. \n\n\nFowler also confirmed today that Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is on track for release in December of 2024. However, that won't be the next time you're able to jump back into this live-action Sonic world. Paramount confirmed in February 2022 that a live-action Knuckles series was in the works with Iris Elba returning. The studio also teased that they were planning to expand the Sonic live-action universe with several other projects as well.\n\n\nThe Knuckles live-action series is slated to arrive on Paramount+ early next year. Sonic the Hedgehog 3 races to theaters on December 20. \n\nThe post Sonic 3 movie director offers a glimpse of Shadow the Hedgehog as filming begins appeared first on Destructoid.",

Here's the run-down:\n\n\n\nMegaton Musashi: Wired arrives on April 25, 2024\n\n\nFantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time is set for summer 2024 (previously confirmed)\n\n\nInazuma Eleven: Victory Road is set for 2024, with a beta in March\n\n\nDecapolice is aiming for 2024\n\n\n\nThe last entry there, Decapolice, caused some mild confusion as the stream stated it was moving to \"post-2024.\" However, the official website from Level-5 states 2024 and so does the Twitter account, so we're leaning in that direction.\n\n\n\n\nA little extra time for Level-5\n\n\nWhile it's a big shift, it's at least heartening to know the studio is taking time where needed. These games have looked impressive in each showing, and Decapolice in particular seemed to make an impact at Tokyo Game Show 2023.\n\n\nIt's a big slate of games and we are running out of 2023, so the delays aren't too surprising. It does mean that even more games are now queued up for an increasingly crowded 2024. I feel like this is happening more frequently now, but seriously: Q1 2024 is looking huge. Games like Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Dragon's Dogma 2, Tekken 8, and more are all slated for the first three months of the year.\n\n\nDespite the clutter, I'm really looking forward to this Level-5 2024 lineup. The Vision II showcase spotlighted some really neat features today, and I could really go for a Level-5 RPG right now. On top of those games, we also caught a glimpse of the next Professor Layton too, which is thankfully taking even more time, aiming for a 2025 launch.\n\nThe post Level-5 pushes multiple games back into 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Toplitz Productions has announced that the next in the Dynasty franchise of games will be Vampire Dynasty, developed by Mehuman Games. It's not expected to hit Early Access until late 2024, but they've provided a cinematic and gameplay trailer for an early look.\n\n\nThe Dynasty series of games is a growing series of simulator titles that include Farmer's Dynasty, Medieval Dynasty, and Sengoku Dynasty. There's usually a different developer on each one, which has yielded some mixed results. I dug through the press release and found that Mehuman is a small Polish studio founded by developers from Movie Games Lunarium, who created the very NSFW Lust from Beyond and Lust for Darkness games.\n\n\n\n\nWhich is funny, because the gameplay trailer is the least sexy thing I've seen that involves vampires. Four dudes in frumpy outfits running through fields. The cinematic trailer is a bit better, if only because we catch a glimpse of what looks like Rayne from BloodRayne's sister. Gotta have that boob window.\n\n\n\n\nThe gameplay includes both open-world exploration and a narrative with branching \"choices matter\" paths. I don't really see any indication if crafting or survival are parts of Vampire Dynasty's core gameplay, but you can build a castle. I assume so you can protect yourself from those pesky Belmonts.\n\n\nWe're a long way away from an Early Access release, so while the gameplay trailer seems a bit sparse, there's a lot of time to buff things up. I'm curious to see how Vampire Dynasty going to compare to V Rising, another open-world vampire game that I think I'm going to reinstall right now. Oh, wait, it looks like I never uninstalled it.\n\n\nVampire Dynasty is coming to Steam Early Access late 2024.\n\nThe post Vampire Dynasty sinks its fangs into Early Access late 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It's been a tough ol' year for people working in the corporate video game world. Publishers and studios have been laying people off at an alarming rate. Embracer Group is just one example, and it's recently been suggested that the holding company may be closing down Free Radical Design.\n\n\nThat's according to sources who recently spoke to VGC. It seems that an email from Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors has confirmed that the TimeSplitters studio will be no more come December 11, \"following the completion of a consultation process.\"\n\n\nImage via IGN.\n\n\nAt the time of writing, this has not been confirmed by the company. However, recent revelations that Embracer will be laying off hundreds of people suggests that Free Radical could well be for the chop.\n\n\nNo more TimeSplitters then?\n\n\nAside from the ongoing bleakness that is the current video game industry, seeing Free Radical go could well spell the end of a possible TimeSplitters revival. The series has been lying dormant for a long time and fans have been hoping to see a new entry, especially from the original developer.\n\n\nEmbracer Group is an enormous company with ownership over many video game developers and publishers, including THQ Nordic, Saber Interactive, Gearbox Entertainment, and Eidos-Montreal.\n\n\nAround 900 jobs are expected to be lost during the restructuring, and rumors about Free Radical being shut down had been circulating. Essentially, if you've been holding out for a new TimeSplitters game, you might be out of luck. Unless another studio can take over it, but it may not be the same under a different team.\n\nThe post Embracer Group could reportedly shutter Free Radical in December appeared first on Destructoid.",

The program itself just seems to go from strength to strength, so it's not surprising that it's being turned into an official video game. Specifically, a VR game.\n\n\nScallywag Arcade, a new developer based in Liverpool, UK, just debuted its trailer for a virtual reality adaptation of Taskmaster. The teaser shows all the familiar assets from the program, such as the studio, the caravan, as well as some of the tasks players will be challenged with.\n\n\n\n\nThe VR comedy will also feature the voices of Taskmaster Greg Davies and his assistant Alex Horne (the actual brains behind the show). There's currently no release date yet, but you can wishlist it on Steam. It also says that it'll be compatible with Steam VR.\n\n\nYour time starts now\n\n\nFeaturing a plethora of well-known British comedians and TV personalities, Taskmaster has not only won BAFTA awards, but has also been adapted outside the UK. There are versions of it in the US, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Spain, Finland, Norway, and more.\n\n\nFor those who haven't seen it, the show sets five panelists a series of tasks over the course of several months. These are filmed at the Taskmaster house in London. These clips are then shown to the Taskmaster himself in the studio, who then gives out points based on a number of criteria (sometimes arbitrary, typically funny).\n\n\nTasks themselves range from the bizarre to puzzling to team-based ones in which contestants must work together. Given the format, it's actually quite surprising that someone hasn't done a VR version of it already. But, here we are now.\n\nThe post Hit TV show Taskmaster is getting its own VR game appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The name of the latest Metroidvania on the block may be Cookie Cutter, though its style is anything but. Originally announced as a \"techno-pop-punk 2D hand-drawn Metroidvania\" in June 2022, developer Subcult Joint's game is now set for a December 14 launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. \n\n\nThe story of Cookie Cutter finds an android named Cherry on a ragin' quest to rescue her creator, Doctor Shinji Fallon. To do so she'll have to take on a \"deranged mastermind\" with her brawling skills and a handful of weapons that accentuate the carnage at the heart of the action. It's all balanced on the back of a dystopian setting, complete with a deceitful corporation called INFONET and the armies at its disposal. \n\n\nWatch as Cherry unleashes some of that pent-up mix of love and rage in the new release date trailer:\n\n\n\n\nBoth the devs and publisher Rogue Games, Inc. put a lot of emphasis on the hand-drawn aspect of Cookie Cutter, and for good reason. From the first slice of combat footage, the animation stands out immediately. As far as Metroidvanias go, there's a lot of familiar visual language conveyed in the latest trailer, but the designs and over-the-top moves definitely have my attention. \n\n\nCookie Cutter was previously just announced for PC (Steam/Epic Games Store), so this is the first we've seen of PlayStation and Xbox versions. According to the description, the team took inspiration from manga and the films of Quentin Tarantino. We'll see how that powered-up pop culture combo plays out very soon. \n\nThe post Cookie Cutter is a blood-soaked, hand-drawn Metroidvania that’s out this December appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "CD Projekt Red managed to turn things around after the catastrophic launch of a certain dystopian RPG. With Cyberpunk 2077 getting an Ultimate Edition next month, not to mention the success of the Phantom Liberty DLC, the studio is mending its reputation. Right now, the company is looking to the future, as more staff are posted to its new Witcher projects.\n\n\nIn a recent earnings conference call, CDPR said the number of people working on Cyberpunk will be decreasing over time, with developers being transferred to Polaris, the code name for one of the upcoming Witcher games. This team, in particular, is \"steadily growing\" with nearly 330 people being moved over to the new project as of the end of October 2023.\n\n\n\n\nThe video goes on to say that this number is expected to increase to over 400 within the middle of next year. According to the company website, over 1,000 people are employed at CD Projekt Red, so that's a huge chunk working on The Witcher. You can check out a PDF version of the presentation on CDPR's official site.\n\n\nBusy, busy, busy\n\n\nThere's a lot going on with CDPR at the moment. With several new games in the Witcher franchise currently in development, and an official remake of the first game in the pipeline, it's going to be hands-on for the team for the next few years.\n\n\nThere's also a Cyberpunk 2077 follow-up that's in the works, as well as a brand-new IP called Hadar. There's no telling what the future holds for the Polish studio, but it sounds like there's a lot to look forward to.\n\nThe post CD Projekt Red is ramping up the team size for the new Witcher saga appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Dead by Daylight continues its trend of adding well-known movie and video game horror villains to its increasing roster. Now, Child's Play is the latest franchise to be incorporated, as developer Behaviour Interactive brings the killer doll Chucky to the game.\n\n\nA new trailer for the patch shows the pint-sized terror doing what he does best: stabbing people to death. Chucky comes with two modes, Normal and Hidey-Ho, the latter of which makes him temporarily undetectable. He's also in a fixed third-person camera view due to his short stature.\n\n\n\n\nDead by Daylight has also added in The Good Gal, which is essentially Tiffany. Fans of both the game and the Child's Play series will be pleased to know that Brad Dourif has reprised his role as the voice of Chucky.\n\n\nNo short-changing with this update\n\n\nBut it's not just Chucky and Tiffany that have been added in. Patch 7.4.0 also brings with it a few changes, including some tweaks to a number of DbD's killers. There's also been a slight reduction to some of the larger maps, specifically Mother's Dwelling and Red Forest Realm.\n\n\nIf that wasn't enough, the update also implements a ton of fixes, adds in a Player Card, which you \"can earn collectable banners and badges\" for, and adds support for AMD's FSR 1.0 upscaling technology. You can see the full patch notes on the Steam page.\n\n\nIt's a pretty sweet gig Dead by Daylight has. While a popular asymmetrical horror game in general, the fact that it has a long list of other franchises it can utilize for characters and enemies lends it that extra bit of longevity. With it now bringing Chucky into the mix, it kind of makes me want to reinstall it again.\n\nThe post Chucky becomes the newest killer to be added to Dead by Daylight appeared first on Destructoid.",

The previously handheld-only turn-based RPG will come to Switch, PS4, PS5, and PC early next year. The March 22 release date is for both NA and EU regions, while the JP release is scheduled for February 1. NIS America also released a gameplay trailer showing off the remastered visuals of The Legend of Legacy.\n\n\n\n\nDeveloped by Cattle Call, the RPG takes place on the island of Avalon, a lost continent discovered just a decade before the game takes place. The Legend of Legacy features seven playable characters who visit the island of Avalon in search of answers from this mysteriously unique island. Plays will explore various areas of Avalon while delving into dungeons in search of loot.\n\n\nThe Legend of Legacy HD Remastered features improved graphics as well as a new guidebook function that makes it easier for newcomers to the RPG to get started. According to the Steam page, more intuitive gameplay options and ease of access have also been added in the remaster. \n\n\nI never had the opportunity to play The Legend of Legacy, but it did always pique my interest. To me, it seemed like a mix of traditional standard JRPG like Bravely Default mashed together with more of a focus on exploration like Etrian Odyssey. I don't know why but it always feels rewarding to map things out, which is apparently a big feature of The Legend of Legacy as you explore the island of Avalon.\n\n\nThe Legend of Legacy HD Remastered releases on March 22, 2024 on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.\n\nThe post The Legend of Legacy HD Remastered set to release in March 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "RPG Maker and indie horror games have an amazing symbiotic relationship. The engine is relatively cheap and easy to use, even for those who have little experience with coding games. It also has enough flexibility to let creators create wonderful 2D adventures, either as an RPG or another genre. Horror itself also remains ripe for interesting and experimental stories that best suit a medium like gaming. \n\n\nMany RPG Maker horror gems receive the recognition they deserve while others remain highly underrated. Both camps deserve recognition for their respective contributions, no matter how deeply buried the hidden gems are.\n\n\nWhether you're a newcomer or familiar with horror games in RPG Maker, here are some I think you should check out.\n\n\nScreenshot via Miro Haverinen\n\n\nFear and Hunger 2: Ter…",

          "description": "Action game developer Action Square revealed an open playtest for their extraction PvPvE dungeon crawler title, Dungeon Stalkers, starting today. The multiplayer extraction game is the first of three to be showcased during their currently ongoing Action Square Steam Fest. Those interested in participating in the playtest simply need to visit the Dungeon Stalkers Steam page and click the green Request Access button.\n\n\n\n\nA fun take on the extraction dungeon crawler genre\n\n\nDark and Darker mashed the dungeon crawling and extraction genres together, and Dungeon Stalkers looks to expand on that. I had the opportunity to delve into a few dungeons in Dungeon Stalkers a couple of weeks ago and had a good time slicing up other players to take their loot before trying to extract. Dungeon Stalkers is very clearly inspired by Dark and Darker, but it also adds its own touch as well.\n\n\nPerhaps the most obvious change is the art style. Even though the dungeons are still dark—and honestly at the build I played, VERY dark, though I was told that would change—the characters and enemies in the dungeon have a more animated style to them. This is amplified by the skillset of the characters. While Dark and Darker utilizes more methodical Dungeons and Dragons style skills, Dungeon Stalkers leans more into big crazy skills. One of the characters wields a two-handed sword that you can charge up to essentially whirlwind around. Overall it feels like an improvement on the genre, and I'm excited to see where Dungeon Stalkers ends up.\n\n\nThere's no release date for Dungeon Stalkers yet, but the open playtest runs through December 4.\n\nThe post Extraction dungeon crawler Dungeon Stalkers begins open playtest appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you like bears, breakfast, and management sims, boy do we have some wildly specific news for you. Armor Games Studios and Gummy Cat announced that Bear and Breakfast is coming to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on December 12, 2023.\n\n\nIt's been a little over a year since Bear and Breakfast made its debut on PC. It first hit Steam on July 28, 2022, with a Nintendo Switch port following on September 15, 2022. The game's PlayStation Store page is now live with the ability to add to wishlists. Armor Games Studios shared a new trailer to go along with the update.\n\n\n\n\nBear and Breakfast has made a name for itself and garnered very positive reviews on Steam for many reasons. First of all, its art direction is just as adorable as its concept, which is exactly what the title implies. You play a bear who is attempting to run a bed and breakfast in the middle of the forest, eventually turning an abandoned shack into a one-stop tourist destination. You can personalize the heck out of your cozy inn, from gathering basic resources to choosing and placing furniture and fixtures. \n\n\nAs detailed in a recent message, the team at Gummy Cat has been through quite a lot lately. Art director Ioana Șopov was diagnosed with Stage 4 Metastatic Breast Cancer, so the team has rallied together to focus efforts on her treatment and well being. As a result, an upcoming expansion has been delayed. \n\n\nThe team is clearly grateful for everyone's continued support, and frankly it's amazing that the game is coming to PlayStation so soon under these circumstances. We wish them all the best and hope they take the time they need to continue prioritizing their health above all else. \n\nThe post Bear and Breakfast brings cozy management to PlayStation on December 12 appeared first on Destructoid.",

In my review, I wrote that the game’s “ingenious climbing system, beautiful art direction, and intriguing world-building, inching toward the top is worth the effort.” That effort can be attributed to Don’t Nod honing in on the game’s central mechanic, climbing, and building a fascinating world and lore around it. I spoke to the game’s lead designer, Sofiane Saheb, and art director, Edouard Caplain, to better understand how Don’t Nod spent over three years bringing Jusant to life. \nCaplain statesJusant’s development began after Don’t Nod finished work on Life is Strange 2.

While we still don’t know his exact role or who will voice him, today’s image, posted above, provides a good look at Shadow below the neck (does he have a neck?), namely his signature air shoes. \nOff and RUNNING. #SonicMovie3\npic.twitter.com/BUIlurNIC0\nNovember 29, 2023\nProduction on Sonic the Hedgehog 3 had stalled due to the SAG-AFTRA strikes, and today’s update confirms work has resumed following the strike's suspension. Jeff Fowler remains in the director’s chair, and the returning cast includes Ben Schwartz (Sonic), Colleen O'Shaughnessey (Tails), Idris Elba (Knuckles), and James Marsden (Tom Wachowski).\nWhatever the third film entails, it has one heck of an act to follow. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was a box office smash, becoming the highest-grossing video game film of all time in the U.S. until The Super Mario Bros. Movie took that crown earlier this year. A live-action TV spin-off starring Knuckles is also in the works and slated to release early next year.",

The news was accidentally posted early to the Xbox store and was even briefly available to play (albeit in unfinished form) on Ubisoft Plus. \nAccording to its now-deleted Xbox Store page (which was shared by Wario64 on X), the 2003 adventure will now feature 4K graphics and 60 FPS with improvements to controls and audio. It will also feature auto-save and cross-save functionality. Here’s the full blurb:\nThe store page also included a big batch of screenshots of the remaster, which can view in the gallery below.\n\nAccording to Ubisoft’s statement to IGN. , the store listing went up early due to a “technical error” \n\"As we celebrate the 20th anniversary of Beyond Good & Evil, we're excited to share that the official launch is set for early 2024, and we look forward to sharing more with you in the new year,\" Ubisoft wrote in the statement. \nBeyond Good & Evil originally launched for PlayStation 2, Xbox, PC, and GameCube in 2003.

Gameplay involves taking on enemies in martial arts melee combat while using Jade's camera to take photos of clues and evidence while solving puzzles. The cult classic received its first big remaster in 2011 in the form of an HD upgrade, while its long-lost sequel, Beyond Good and Evil 2, has seemingly been in development limbo since its formal reveal at E3 2017. \nBeyond Good & Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition is expected to launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",

One of those companies is Nuverse, a game publisher best known in the West for its work on Marvel Snap. Fans of the superhero card-battler had reason for concern this morning, as an article from Reuters reported that ByteDance had plans to leave the gaming space entirely, with intentions to \"divest from titles already launched.\" This seemed to spell doom for Marvel Snap.\nHowever, the official Marvel Snap X account issued a statement today that this would not be the case.\nDear SNAPPERS,\nNovember 27, 2023\nIt's unclear exactly why the PC and mobile game will be exempt from any changes, but we're happy to hear that one of the best games from 2022 isn't going anywhere.

The game currently has no release window but will launch on PlayStation 5 and PC. \n\n\nHere is Bloober Team’s full update: \nSilent Hil 2 remake was one of many new Silent Hill projects announced last October. The first one to arrive was Silent Hill Ascension, an interactive streaming series that premiered on Halloween. Other projects in the pipeline include Silent Hill f, a new mainline entry set in 1960s Japan, and Silent Hill Townfall, a mysterious title published by Annapurna Interactive and developed by No Code, the creators of Observation.

Free-to-play games are not universally bad; plenty of brilliant design ideas, engaging stories, and fun mechanics can be found in games with no upfront admission fee. But once a game’s goal shifts from singular experience to long-term engagement, any excitement I may have folds in on itself and disappears like Pac-Man.\nIt all stems from my desire for experiences, not obligations.\nIn free-to-play and comparable models, success is marked by player engagement.

But the web-slinger has had so many video games (and series of games) that he’s racked up an alarming number of “Spider-Man 2” games, so with the latest iteration currently printing money for PlayStation, it’s time to finally reflect on and rank all of them. What’s the best second Spider-Man game? The answer may mildly surprise you. \n1\t\n  \nMarvel's Spider-Man 2\nDisclosure: we all know Miles Morales is the real Spider-Man 2 but its lack of number would ruin the gag.

          "description": "Nintendo ended a recent live stream sharing the final trailer for The Super Mario Bros. Movie with a strange and unexpected announcement. Alongside animation studio Illumination, it had teamed up with Red Wing Shoes to make Mario’s shoes from the movie, not as a line of shoes for sale, but rather a hyper-realistic version of the boots – odd proportions and all – to be displayed at the official Nintendo Store in New York City.\n\nThe interest in Mario’s shoes began with the movie’s first teaser poster, where the fidelity of Mario’s footwear blew fans away. People wanted to know more about them, which led Nintendo and Illumination to contact Red Wing Shoes, a Minnesota company specializing in work boots, about making some. “We got the call, and naturally, we’re like, ‘Well, Mario is the world’…",

In December, that expansion pack is expanding a little more, as Jet Force Gemini is coming to the service.\nFirst released in 1999, Jet Force Gemini is a third-person shooter developed by Rare, the studio originally known for the Banjo-Kazooie games, but most recently known for Sea of Thieves. It's set on a sci-fi alien world, where players blast through hordes of insect-like creatures.\nThe most recent way players could experience the game on modern consoles was through Rare Replay, a compilation of classic Rare games released on the Xbox One in 2015.  For a refresher on the game, check out this 60-second rundown Rare put out a few years back.\n\n\nThe Switch Online currently includes 26 other N64 games, including the recently added Excitebike 64. It also includes Game Boy Advance games, Sega Genesis games, and DLC content for popular Switch titles, like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Animal Crossing. For the full list, check out our rundown here.",

Whether it's Travis Scott, Lebron James, or Patrick Mahomes, it's become a sort of Hollywood Star of Fame to be featured in Epic Games' hit shooter. Today. Marshall Mathers joins the club – Eminem is coming to Fortnite. \nThe Grammy winner will be added to the game's item shop on November 29. The image above shows the three versions of the rapper that will be available for purchase. From left to right, they're called Rap Boy, Slim Shady, and Marshall Never More. This release comes a few days ahead of Fortnite's Big Bang event, which is set to happen on December 2 at 2 PM Eastern. Alongside whatever world-altering event phenomena Epic plans to introduce, Eminem will be performing a live concert. Attendees will receive the Big Bang loading screen, featured at the head of this article.\nFortnite has been in gaming news a lot recently, thanks to the rollout of Fortnite OG, a record-setting new season that throws players back in time to the earliest maps in the game. It's also come under fire for new rules about which skins are allowed in certain creator-made worlds: you can see their response to this controversy here.\nWhat's your dream Fortnite collaboration?

          "description": "After four seasons of brand new content, Epic Games injected a healthy dose of nostalgia into Fornite Chapter 4's fifth season, officially called Season OG, by bringing back the Chapter 1 map for players to experience once more. Season OG has included weekly updates to add items from Chapter 1's various seasons, too, making it a fun romp through what Fortnite was like years ago. However, Season OG ends on December 2, which is also when Fortnite's next live event, The Big Bang, goes live. \nThe Big Bang begins on Saturday, December 2, at 11 a.m. PT/2 p.m. ET, and Epic says, \"This event marks a new beginning for Fortnite.\" \n✅ Unforgettable event\npic.twitter.com/xAhMKtmwiG\nNovember 21, 2023\nBefore the event begins, Epic says players will see The Big Bang in the Battle Royale tile in the Discover section of Fortnite 30 minutes prior to its start; that way, you can jump in before the event starts to link up with friends and get your cosmetics in order. And speaking of friends, The Big Bang will support parties of up to four players. \nThe Big Bang will be available anywhere you play the most current build of Fortnite, including PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. If you won't be near a dedicated gaming device during the event, you can check it out using Xbox Cloud Gaming, Nvidia GeForce Now, and Amazon Luna services to play Fortnite via cloud streaming on your computer or mobile device. \n\"To prepare for The Big Bang, Fortnite experiences made by Epic will be disable starting 12 p.m. ET on December 2,\" Epic writes in a blog post. \"Creator-made experiences will remain enabled until downtime for Fortnite v28.00 starts at 11:30 p.m. ET.\"\nWhile waiting for The Big Bang event, read up on everything you need to know about Fortnite Chapter 4: Season OG, and then read about how Epic says it's aware it missed the mark with a recent cosmetic restriction update for Fortnite. \nAre you hopping into Fortnite's Big Bang event next month?

          "description": "CD Projekt Red released Phantom Liberty, the first and last expansion for its 2020 RPG, Cyberpunk 2077, in September. We loved it – find out why in Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty review here – and if you enjoyed the base game, it's not an expansion to miss. Currently, it's only available for purchase as an add-on to Cyberpunk 2077, but if you haven't yet picked it up, it might be worth waiting just a couple more weeks. That's because CDPR has revealed Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition, which includes the base game and the Phantom Liberty expansion in one single package.\nCyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on December 5, and will be released in both a digital format and physical. Check out the box art below: \nBig news… Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition arrives on December 5th in digital AND physical form for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC!\n#Cyberpunk2077 story as well as a new spy-thriller adventure in the #PhantomLiberty expansion in one package. 🔥 pic.twitter.com/IOBPCdTXFU\nNovember 21, 2023\nAll that CDPR has shared about this new edition is the tweet above so it remains to be seen if the Ultimate Edition includes any new goodies or enhancements. Given Phantom Liberty and the Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 update improved the game in big ways, reworking and revamping several of its mechanics in the process, it's unlikely the Ultimate Edition will include any changes in that vein. Only time will tell, though. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077 review and then read Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty review. After that, read about the things to remember and know before starting Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, and then check out this feature about how the team behind the expansion created its spy-thriller soundtrack.

          "description": "Yakuza: Like A Dragon was a very silly game in spite of its dramatic narrative, but its follow-up, Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, looks to give it a run for its money. Between letting Ichiban ride a dolphin and its Animal Crossing-style city-building mode, fans of the franchise’s goofball nature should be in for a treat, and a new batch of screenshots highlight this.\nThe images provide looks at Ichiban, Kiryu Joryu, and their returning friends, such as Nanba, Adachi, and Saeko, kicking butt in a variety of classes and looking absurd doing so. Other familiar faces will be playable party members for the first time, such as Seonhee, who is shown brutalizing opponents with a whip in the images. It's clear that Hawaii will never be the same once these guys are done with it. \n\n\nLike A Dragon: Infinite Wealth hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on January 26.

          "description": "Final Fantasy VII Rebirth arrives in February, which isn’t too far on the horizon, so Square Enix is getting players prepared with a cinematic refresher of its predecessor, Final Fantasy VII Remake. The company pairs that with a batch of fresh screenshots and art, including the first glimpse of the Highwind airship. \nThe video sees Red XIII narrate the broad strokes of the 2020 adventure. While it doesn’t touch on the finer details and background of the characters, it provides a decent summary that's perhaps better served as a reminder for fans who played Remake rather than someone coming into Rebirth completely fresh. Unfortunately, the recap doesn’t touch on the events of the Intermission expansion that introduces Yuffie, who joins the party in Rebirth, so unfamiliar players will have to do their own homework on that. \n\n\nSquare has released some new images, including a piece of art depicting Aerith in front of the Highwind. The screenshots show off the town of Kalm, the summon Kujata, the abandoned Mythril Mine, and a few side characters. Oh, and Chadley is there too. \n\nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth launches on February 29 for PlayStation 5. You can watch us play two demos of the game in this video and read our hands-on impressions here. You can also get the answers to some of Rebirth's burning questions in this interview with Square Enix.",

Depending on a Fortnite skin, it might only be useable on a creative island with a T rating, meaning the Resident Evil Claire Redfield skin, which features a pistol in a holster on her thigh, can't be used on islands rated less than Teen. Players were upset with this change as it made skins they paid real money for (often $10 to $20 per skin) unusable in all the ways they might have previously been usable. \nEpic said only 7 percent of Fortnite skins are only usable on Teen-rated islands, at the time, but it's clear enough skins are affected to have the community unhappy with this update.\nOver the weekend, Epic released a statement through the official Fortni…",

You access him the same way, too – by buying fireworks and trading them with the little girl nearby in Moletown for a shiny stone.

However, a series of strange accidents, plus some murmurings of a ghost haunting, quickly threaten to turn this renovation into an investigation.\nIn Nancy Drew: Treasure in the Royal Tower a failed ski vacation at an eccentric castle with even more eccentric inhabitants soon turns into a quest to uncover a lost piece of the history of the French Revolution.\nAnd if you’re looking for something more thrilling, in Nancy Drew: The Final Scene, you will find yourself racing against the clock to find your kidnapped friend, while also saving a historical theater with more than a fair share of secrets from demolition.\nThe games are available for purchase through HeR Interactive’s website or Steam (Stay Tuned for Danger is not available on Steam, however).

Only the DOS version of the game (available on gog.com) is supported. It's a cartoon FMV game, with an inventory, in which you have to guide Lathan Kandor through a medieval world, discovering the magic spells and the items required to defeat an evil wizard. \nEscape From Hell, was developed for Electronic Arts by the game veterans Richard Seaborne and Alan Murphy and was released in 1990. You play Alan in this keyboard-only Role Playing Game and visit Hell, looking for your girlfriend who was accidentally teleported there.\nBoth games use heavily hardcoded logic which is error prone and requires a lot of testing, so we need your feedback more than ever as they are both incompletely tested. There is sadly only one known demo for Kingdom. Support for the Windows and Mac versions of Kingdom may come later! Please contact us if you have some other demos of both games.\nTo play any of these games, you will need a daily development build.
