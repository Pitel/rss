Not only did we get 20 more minutes of its gorgeous open worlds, mini-games and story nuggets to gawp over this week thanks to Sony's dedicated State Of Play stream for it, but the internet has also been awash with previews, interviews and all sorts of other Final Fantasy-shaped goodies. Honestly, it's like a second Christmas for me over here at the moment, it's great. \nBut one thing that really stuck out to me this week was a comment made by series producer Yoshinori Kitase in an interview with our friends at Eurogamer. When they asked him why remake Final Fantasy 7 at all, his response hit me much harder than I was expecting. He said that the original FF7 is \"probably going to be always that game my dad played, and I don't want it to be that.\" Aside from making me crumble to dust with irrelevancy, this really got me thinking about older games, the way we play them now, and just what role remakes and remasters have in today's PC gaming landscape. So come and feel incredibly old with me as I try and get my (very jumbled and loosely-related) thoughts in order.\nRead more",

          "description": "When playing any character-driven videogame I sometimes experience a sensation akin to my eyes unfocussing, and remember that I'm not, strictly speaking, controlling a body in a world, but interacting with a simulation that includes representations of a body and a world. The character is just an interfacial node in a vast tangle of visible and invisible elements; by moving the character, I cause objects, surfaces, creatures to load or unload, spring into motion or change colour and a million things besides.\nSome games foreground these interdependencies by fictionalising the simulation as a giant organism or ecosystem, a more intriguing kind of \"living, breathing\" environment which is aware of your presence within it. Amongst these games is Ultros, a side-scrolling, psychedelic metroidvania - or as developers Hadoque might prefer, \"gardenvania\" - which launches next week.\n Read more",

On the one hand, there's arguably a hungry new audience for such games; on the other, you're going up against one of the best RPGs ever made. Expectations are high, but Tiny Trinket Games' co-founder Stefan Nitescu remains unfazed as his three-strong team prepare to release Zoria: Age Of Shattering on March 7th. Zoria is carving an altogether different path through the RPG landscape, fusing isometric exploration with XCOM-like combat and 50 playable characters who are more like unit classes than personalities. The latter is a decision that comes with its own \"repercussions\", says Nitescu, but he's confident that it will help Zoria stand apart, with character abilities being unusually central to exploration. \nRead more",

          "description": "Calling dusty post-apocalyptic city builders a trend is probably a stretch, but not by much. I suppose it's a natural extension of the post-2000s explosion of the survival sim from \"literally about 3 ever made\" to \"does your tetris remake really need the hunger meter\". Games like Against The Storm porting over the roguelike element as well certainly suggest it. In my head, that's probably why New Cycle hangs out more with Endzone Dash A World Apart, and Surviving The Aftermath. It's more a traditional building game than a punishing test to be retaken, or the intense \"survive the ordeal\" narrative of Frostpunk, despite the superficial similarity that your town expects to be ravaged by scorching solar flares.\nBut it might also be because after playing it more than I really wanted to, New Cycle matches those two peers by leaving me with a vague feeling of disappointment. I'm just not sure what it really has to say.\nRead more",

I think that's a thing inherent in me, as I've never taken great pleasure in snapping together pieces of Lego, and would much rather earn killstreaks than decorate a back garden. For me, building in most games is laborious and predictable and does not sate my impatient brain.\nBut I like Neal Agarwal's Infinite Craft, a browser game where you slide words on top of each other and see if they generate something new. For instance, \"water\" and \"fire\" combine to make \"steam\", with what's practically infinitesimal possibilities. It is immediate, simple, and unpredictable.

It will now launch on February 22nd, instead of its original date of February 14th - which is a damn shame, if you ask me, as nothing screams \"romantic Valentine's night-in\" like trying to backstab your other half in a bid to rule hell in Satan's absence. Alas, we'll just have to make do with the altogether more pedestrian date of a regular Thursday in February, as the team need just a bit of extra time to ensure it's \"as polished as possible\" before release. \nRead more",

Cute miniature puzzle game Lumino City is ten years old, and Trüberbrook is coming up on five. And I first played a tiny snippet of Harold Halibut in 2018. Now, a larger snippet is available for everyone in the Steam Next Fest.\nHarold Halibut is a sort of sci-fi, slightly retrofuturist point and click puzzle game about an undersea society on an alien planet. These people's ancestors blasted off to an ocean planet using the technology of a big science corporation and now, though they can't remember why, they're all pootling about under the water looking at fish. In this world of exaggerated sea-science nonsense, Harold stands out as a sort of beige lab handyman.\nRead more",

Since its surprise launch in February 2019, developers Respawn Entertainment have chopped and changed everything from hitbox-shrinking Naruto run animations to entire character designs and ability kits, gutting and reworking gear and class mechanics along the way. The incoming Season 20 update, titled Breakout, represents the latest large-scale rejig, adding upgradeable skill tress for its playable Legends that promise MOBA-esque progression and the maddest fights yet.\nThen again, if you actually ask Respawn’s Apex team how they reached this point – as I did when I visited their Los Angeles offices for a Season 20 test run – you’re unlikely to get just one answer. Rather, the battle royale’s unusual longevity in a fiercely contested space is more often attributed to those ongoing work-and-rework efforts themselves, the scope of which sometimes remains a surprise to the developers themselves. As does, according to lead game designer Devan McGuire, Apex’s success.\nRead more",

This isn't confirmation that a third single player Last Of Us game is in development, with Druckmann reiterating comments from this time last year that Naughty Dog feel no obligation to continue the tale. Nonetheless, \"it does feel like there's probably one more chapter to this story.\" Will we ever really see the last of The Last Of Us?\nRead more",

The same bug has returned, with different steps to make it work, what seems like every six months since Warzone came out.

Inevitable. \n\n\nEveryone knew Palworld was going to be a big deal after its earliest announcement trailers, but nobody was prepared for just how huge it would be when it was released on January 19. \n\n\nPerhaps most surprised by its success was developer Pocket Pair, who are now pleading with interested parties to come work on the game. \n\n\nPocketPair puts out a plea for Palworld developer applications\n\n\nIn a message on the official Palworld Twitter/X page, PocketPair shared a message seemingly from the point of view of a lonely pal.\n\n\n\"There are still many things I want to do in Palworld, but we are severely lacking in friends!!!\" the message  (which we machine translated) begins. \n\n\n\n\n\"We are recruiting for all positions, but we are especially looking for planning/engineering positions!\" the message continues. \"It doesn't matter what engine you have experience with, so if you are interested in creating a completely new game, please apply!!\"\n\n\nThere are not a lot of specifics available about just how big (or small) Pocket Pair is. However, we know from a post on Pocket Pair CEO Takuro Mizobe's Note page that it was as small as a 10-person team at one point, where he referred to the game's release as \"Miracle 4.\"\n\n\n\"Palworld was originally intended to be completed in one year.\" Mizobe wrote in the January 16th blog. \"I have no desire to create a major title in the first place. I don't have any desire to make the same thing over and over again. And no matter how you look at it, the company Pocketpair is not suited to making large titles. Actually, there were only 10 people at the time, so I didn't have that image at all.\"\n\n\nPalworld is available now on Steam, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One. \n\nThe post Palworld dev Pocket Pair announces it’s hiring: ‘We are SEVERELY lacking in friends!’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Have you ever wanted to listen to the music of The Legend of Zelda live? Well, consider your wish granted. Nintendo has dropped the VOD for The Legend of Zelda Orchestra Concert onto their YouTube after canceling the originally Tokyo-exclusive performance at Nintendo Live 2024 TOKYO.\n\n\n\n\nSome of the tracks performed include Kakariko Village, The Ballad of the Goddess, and the main theme of Tears of the Kingdom. The orchestra beautifully showcases the series' rich musical history through powerful renditions of the beloved classics. At a runtime of almost a half hour, it'll make for a pretty nice trip down memory lane if you're up for that adventure. \n\n\nAlso posted were statues of the Tears of the Kingdom's versions of Zelda, Link, and our no.1 hottie (according to Zoey Handley), Ganondorf. \n\n\n\n\nThe concert was originally planned for Nintendo Live TOKYO in January. Nintendo canceled the event after receiving threats targeting the audience and workers. \n\n\nIn addition to the Zelda concert, Nintendo also held a Splatoon 3-themed concert the morning of February 10. \n\n\nMusically Inclined\n\n\nWhether you like The Legend of Zelda or not, you have to agree the music is amazing. Whether it's the classic Koji Kondo tracks or the newer Manaka Kataoka compositions, all Zelda music is downright memorable. So, to be able to have a whole concert dedicated to it and done live is pretty awesome. \n\n\nWatching the concert made me realize something: I really want to see it live. The closest I got to that was Lindsey Stirling with her Zelda melody years ago. And, as someone who's watched the trailers for Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wind multiple times for the songs, I'd pay good money. I feel the same way about Final Fantasy and Sonic, as all of them have amazing orchestral tracks that'd be amazing to see live. So, Nintendo, maybe you could plan a national tour or something? Fine, I'll just play my ocarina in private.\n\nThe post The Legend of Zelda Orchestra Concert VOD is now available appeared first on Destructoid.",

I don’t actually play them much, but they feel good to my soul, at least.\n\n\nOne game I used to play with her is different, however. It’s a puzzle game that I’m actually enthusiastic about and dust off every so often. It's one that I can enjoy without the sentimental attachment, even if some sentiment is still there.

          "description": "According to the recently listed Steam store page, Digital Dreams Entertainment’s Mutant Football League 2 will launch into Early Access in March 2024.\n\n\nReleased in 2017, Mutant Football League serves as the spiritual revival of the 1993 Sega Genesis/Mega Drive game, Mutant League Football. But beyond just slyly changing around the word order to avoid retribution from EA, MFL is helmed by the creator of the original 16-bit titles, Michael Mendheim.\n\n\nMutant Football League 2 is the sequel to the only football game that I actually enjoy and continue to play. Other reception I’ve seen has been lukewarm, but I’m serious. I’ve tried multiple times to get into other football titles like NFL Blitz, but I felt doomed to forever hate the sport. I mean American football, not real football. I suppose the secret sauce to get me interested is to just somehow make it more violent.\n\n\nMutant Football League has you choose a team made up of skeletons, werewolves, and robots and kick the pigskin or something. Beyond just being American football with furries, cheating is encouraged, and violence is an inevitability. The inclusion of dirty tricks just adds an extra layer of fun strategy. Murder is a legitimate strategy, allowing you to focus on eliminating your opponent's best players.\n\n\nThe Early Access release will start with just 12 teams and arenas out of the planned 48. It will be offline only at first, and the team is giving the heads up that it will initially be reusing the audio assets from the first game but will be updated with its own music and VO over time. They’re hoping that the full version will be ready in Fall 2024.\n\n\nThe team has had some difficulty in developing Mutant Football League 2, as many of the developer’s staff are located in Ukraine, which is currently under invasion by Russia.\n\n\nMutant Football League 2 is set to release on Steam Early Access on PC in March\n\nThe post Mutant Football League 2 kicks off into Early Access this March appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Had your eye on that Destiny 2 Exotic weapon ornament or emote but find yourself Bright Dust poor? There is no need to despair or mindlessly grind out Bounties. Bungie announced it will start giving away Bright Dust for free every week beginning in March. \n\n\nThe gifting is set to go on until the launch of The Final Shape expansion in June. And at 700 Bright Dust per weekly reset, it's certainly no small amount to gloss over.\n\n\nBright Dust is one of the premium currencies found within Destiny 2. While players can earn it in-game through various means, it's usually nothing too substantial. Bright Dust is used alongside Silver for purchases through the Eververse Store. It's primarily a shop for cosmetic items like shaders, weapon ornaments, vehicles, or exclusive armor appearances. Though much of the Eververse Store demands Silver, every week, various goodies are sold for Bright Dust instead.\n\n\nBungie dropped this unexpected and generous news in Destiny 2's latest This Week In Destiny communication. In a short section titled \"The Future Is Bright,\" Bungie explained, \"As we head toward The Final Shape, we're honoring Guardians with a new weekly gift of Bright Dust. Starting on March 5, players can visit the Eververse store to claim 700 Bright Dust each week leading up to the launch of The Final Shape. Make sure to log in, get your Dust, and spend wisely, Guardians.\"\n\n\nBright Dust transactions have historically been absent for some of the hottest Destiny 2 cosmetics, like the Witcher crossover armor. That said, plenty of spend-worthy choices are available each week, especially if players have missed past seasons or holiday events. With (by my count) 9100 extra Bright Dust, do yourself a favor and treat yourself.\n\nThe post Bungie will give Destiny 2 players free weekly Bright Dust starting in March appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's a trend that's often met with negative response, but it turns out this is probably not the case for the upcoming game.\n\n\nAccording to a recent update on Unknown World's website – the developer behind the Subnautica series – there are no plans to implement GaaS for the next installment. This is almost certainly a response to what publisher Krafton said in a recent earnings call.\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, while writing the original draft of this story, it looks like Krafton may have changed what it originally said.

          "description": "It's a dismal time to be in video game development, as companies continue to announce layoffs. Now, Take-Two Interactive – the parent company of Rockstar – is looking to enact a \"significant cost reduction plan,\" but it doesn't necessarily mean redundancies.\n\n\nThat's according to CEO and chairman Strauss Zelnick, who told IGN recently that there are \"no current plans\" to lay staff off. The specifics of this plan are said to still being worked out, but Zelnick says there are other areas that need looking at, such as marketing, third-party expenses, supply services, etc.\n\n\n\n\nHe also adds that the \"hardest thing to do is to lay off colleagues,\" though that phrasing sort of suggests one would do it if it was easier. Whether that happens or not remains to be seen.\n\n\nI'm a cynic, what can I say?\n\n\nIt's difficult to talk about Take-Two without mentioning GTA 6. Last year's reveal trailer has been viewed a squillion times, making it one of the most-viewed video game teasers in existence. If the parent company does eventually decide it needs to initiate layoffs, there's no telling whether this would potentially affect the next Grand Theft Auto game.\n\n\nAgain, this is just a complete guess from me. While there aren't any \"current\" plans for layoffs, that doesn't necessarily mean things won't change in the future, near or far.\n\n\nJust recently, Take-Two was also in the headlines, facing a class-action lawsuit regarding microtransactions in NBA games. Hard to find two topics that get people more riled up than layoffs and microtransactions.\n\nThe post GTA parent Take-Two has ‘no current plans’ for layoffs, CEO says appeared first on Destructoid.",

According to Larian, improvements have been made to smooching in the cRPG, as can be seen in the brief video clip they provided. In this teaser, Halsin follows up a passionate kiss with a peck on the forehead, which does not exist in the current build.\n\n\n\n\nFurther enhancements include new camp idle animations, new Legendary Actions in Honour Mode, and a trove of bug fixes. Larian states Patch 6 is a hefty one, so it will be providing full patch notes on the BG3 website at a later date.\n\n\nNo release timeframe was given for the update, but with Valentine's Day right around the corner, I'd have to imagine a kissing-centric patch may try to coincide with that timeframe.\n\n\nPatch 6 marks the sixth big addition to Baldur's Gate 3 that Larian has developed since the cRPG released in August. Each one has added something new while also implementing a ton of bug fixes between the patch and hotfix releases. On our end, we've been tracking Larian's patch cadence with a BG3 update history and schedule. \n\n\nI don't know about you but it may be time to finally start that next BG3 playthrough.

          "description": "Whatever happened to the old Discworld games? Well, they pretty much ceased to be a thing around the late 90s. However, there is a glimmer of hope that the retro point-and-click adventure series may return, so long as it bypasses a small bit of red tape.\n\n\nIn a recent interview with Time Extension, developer Gregg Barnett – co-founder of the now-defunct Perfect Entertainment studio – suggests a rerelease of Discworld could happen. Now, this is a big \"if\" and it's dependent on what the Crown has to say about it.\n\n\nImage via Adventure Gamers.\n\n\nYou see, thanks to a rather unusual law surrounding intellectual properties from UK outfits that are no longer in operation, King Charles III technically owns the rights to the games. Barnett says that \"whenever something closes in the UK, intellectual property rights revert 50% to the original creator and 50% to the Crown.\" In short: it sounds like he'd need to go ask the British head of state for permission before any rerelease can happen.\n\n\nA blast from the royal past\n\n\nFor those who don't know, the late Terry Pratchett's famed fantasy series was adapted into a number of video games back in the day. Discworlds 1 and 2 released in 1995 and 1996, respectively, while Discworld: Noir came out in 1999. After that, we never saw hide nor her of them in digital format.\n\n\nHowever, King Charles' technical ownership of the franchise aside, we may get to see them live again at some point. Whether they'll just be rereleases or full remasters can't be said at this stage. Barnett says that it could potentially \"advance to new versions.\" However, it's a \"complicated process when you’re dealing with the Crown.\" Ain't that the truth...\n\n\nIf you want to learn more about intellectual property rights in the UK (and who doesn't), you can read about it here. Big shoutout to our own Paula for sending that my way.\n\nThe post Discworld could get a rerelease, providing King Charles III permits it appeared first on Destructoid.",

It includes two free updates to further polish the game, as well as DLC with additional content.\n\n\nAgainst the Storm was among my favorite games released last year for combining city building with roguelite elements to create a meaningful experience about efficiency and adaptability. It puts you in a fight against the harsh elements of a beleaguered world and the extremely short patience of a powerful monarch. Your only weapon is your well-honed urban planning skills.\n\n\nOnly the contents of the first patch (1.2) are revealed on the roadmap and consist mostly of aesthetic and quality-of-life updates. 1.3 is still yet to be confirmed. Beyond that, the team intends to release a DLC (assumedly paid) expansion. While the contents of the DLC are still being decided, they suggest it will include things like an additional playable species, another biome, and new buildings, events, perks, and orders. \n\n\nA 1.1 patch including new decorations and portraits released mid-January. Today, alongside the announcement, patch 1.16 dropped, but is entirely bug fixes.\n\n\nIf you haven’t played Against the Storm, I can hardly muster a more enthusiastic recommendation. I know “roguelite” is a word that can cause a lot of people to immediately abandon interest, but I promise you that randomization and run-based features are harnessed for good and not tedium.\n\n\nAgainst the Storm is available now for PC.\n\nThe post Against the Storm roadmap includes DLC and two free updates appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Take-Two Interactive has an interesting response to gamers upset with what the company does with the in-game currency they buy. In an ongoing dispute over whether money is essentially stolen when a game's servers shut down, Take-Two characterized in-game virtual currency as \"fictions created by game publishers.\"\n\n\nCurrently Take-Two is facing a class-action lawsuit in California related to microtransactions in the NBA 2K games. Particularly, the lawsuit takes issue with the fact that when Take-Two takes down servers for old games, players lose access to the virtual currency (VC) that they bought.\n\n\nAccording to Axios, the suit alleges that: “By removing Plaintiff and the Class members' VC, Defendants took and stole their personal property, or fraudulently appropriated property that had been entrusted to Defendant.”\n\n\nIn response to the lawsuit, Take-Two’s lawyers are targeting the claim that virtual currency is property. Game File reports that the company’s attorneys filed a request to dismiss the lawsuit last week. The argument goes that  gamers might have paid to obtain the currency, but it’s not something they can actually own. \n\n\nIn the filing, Take-Two’s attorneys write: “VC is not plaintiff’s property. Instead, in-game VC are fictions created by game publishers, subject to the publishers’ terms of service and user agreements.” \n\n\nThat said, lawsuits targeting microtransactions of all kinds seem to be popping up more frequently. In May 2023, Nintendo faced a class-action suit over the loot boxes in Mario Kart Tour. And NBA 2K has run afoul of microtransaction issues before, with Belgian and Dutch gambling laws in 2018.\n\nThe post Take-Two calls virtual currency ‘fictions created by game publishers’ amid microtransaction lawsuit appeared first on Destructoid.",

Just with more Knuckles, still played by Idris Elba, which is great! This first Knuckles trailer is meaty with a duration of about two-and-a-half minutes. It sets the tone for the Paramount Plus series as we see some of the Echidna's purpose, villains, and more. \n\n\n\n\nJust the other day we saw our first Sonic the Hedgehog 3 teaser drop, which also confirmed the return of Jim Carrey's Dr. Robotnik. In this first Knuckles trailer, we see a new villain that seems like a solid foil for to the great Echidna Warrior. \n\n\nThis unnamed villain is played by Rory McCann. The actor is perhaps best known for portraying the massive fan-favorite Sandor Clegane, also known as The Hound, in HBO's Game of Thrones.\n\n\nMcCann's character and his underlings have access to Knuckles' powers in the streaming series. This seemingly sets up equally powered battles between the opposing factions. \n\n\nWhat has Knuckles been up to?\n\n\nAs for Knuckles' motivations, he appears to have hit a bit of a slump following the Sonic 2 movie. This series takes place directly after the sequel but before the upcoming Sonic the Hedgehog 3. Knuckles finally finds purpose in training a new warrior though. That student? Tom Wachowski's Deputy of Green Hills, Wade Whipple.\n\n\nThere's likely to be plenty of buddy cop-esque comedy between Knuckles and Wade throughout the six-episode limited series. The short episode count may have been a great decision for the show because it looks fantastic quality-wise. We'll see how this new chapter of the Sonic cinematic universe turns out when Knuckles begins streaming via Paramount Plus on April 26.\n\nThe post First Knuckles trailer looks awesome, and drops the series release date appeared first on Destructoid.",

Yes, that's the real title, thanks for clearing up the starring role!\n\n\nFor real though it's been a long time since these games were released (28, 27, and 26 years respectively), so I can see why people would be rusty.

          "description": "If you've played Daggerfall Unity, you'll know it's the best way to experience The Elder Scrolls 2 in the modern gaming climate. Now, with the full thing having recently launched, the creator of the project is looking to make their own game.\n\n\nIn a recent interview with DualShockers, developer Gavin Clayton said he's now working on his own idea, which will be styled after Daggerfall. He has this to say about the project:\n\n\n\nI do genuinely love that old style of game. The thing I’m building is in the same vein. You’re talking big world, complex systems, mod support, that’s all of the stuff I want to explore, and I want to take that experience of Daggerfall Unity and put it in the new game.\n\n\n\n\nEssentially, Clayton wants to realize his dream of making a game from scratch, something he's dreamed of since he was a kid.\n\n\nWith some D&D influence in there, perhaps\n\n\nWhile there are no details about what this game will actually be, he's been open to answering a few questions on Twitter/X.\n\n\nFor example, when asked whether he was going to be using Unity, Clayton said he's building his own engine, or, more accurately, he's \"revived an engine I spent some years on.\"\n\n\nAs for any kind of lore or narrative, the project is still in the early stages, but when asked, the response was that the \"world and main story have their roots in a D&D 2ED campaign I created and ran for friends in the 90s.\"\n\n\nDaggerfall Unity has been an enormous task for anyone to complete, especially as it was a full remake using a different engine. It's almost certainly reinvigorated interest in Bethesda's classic RPG, and I would personally recommend anyone interested in retro Elder Scrolls games to check it out.\n\nThe post Daggerfall Unity creator is making their own retro Elder Scrolls-esque game appeared first on Destructoid.",

Notably, the developer has just revealed that the game's entire Car Level progression mechanic will be getting upended in accordance with player feedback.\n\n\nNotably, Turn 10 has gone back to the drawing board with Forza Motorsport's Car Level mechanic, as promised earlier this year. From the very start, a vocal portion of the player base has been highly critical of Turn 10's decision to lock vehicle upgrades behind level gates that, granted, do take a while to reach. The issue was so serious at one point, in fact, that players discovered a way to fully automate the process just to side-step it. That's all set to change with Update 6, however, w…",

          "description": "For a game that was built in collaboration with AMD, it seems surprising that it's taken this long for Starfield to support FidelityFX Super Resolution 3. However, the most recent update now makes it compatible with the image upscaling algorithm. But of course, there's a slight catch.\n\n\nThe recent patch notes, as well as a message on Twitter/X, show that Bethesda has finally enabled the option for FSR 3. The slight downside to this is that it's only released in Steam Beta, but at least it's started rolling out now, I guess.\n\n\n\n\nAs for what else version 1.9.67 of Starfield includes, we're being told that Intel's own Xe Super Sampling – a rival to FSR and Nvidia's DLSS – is also supported now. There have also been a few other fixes, but apart from the aforementioned AMD and Intel tech, this seems like a relatively small update.\n\n\nThe future of Starfield...\n\n\nWe all know the story now, but it's worth repeating. For what was the most hyped-up game of this generation, many of us were left largely shrugging our shoulders after a few hours of playing.\n\n\nAt the time of writing, SteamDB shows that 5,310 people are currently playing Starfield on PC. That's not enough for a Bethesda game that – as the studio continued to remind us – was almost 25 years in the making.\n\n\nWe've been promised some major updates to the game in the future, which may or may not represent turning points. The reality of the situation, however, is that while some people will be happy FSR 3 is now an option, it's going to take more than that to get people interested in the game again.\n\nThe post Starfield, for those still playing, finally supports AMD FSR 3 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Recently, we brought news that Embracer Group was laying off staff at Eidos Montreal. This brought to the fore the uncertainty of the Deus Ex franchise, and now some words of thanks have come from the voice of Adam Jensen himself.\n\n\nIn a recent post on the Mankind Divided subreddit, Elias Toufexis wanted to express his appreciation for the support over the years. With this, the actor has essentially said goodbye to Jensen, adding that \"his story seems done.\"\n\n\n\n\nWith the future of Deus Ex uncertain, Toufexis has said that the recent layoffs and the alleged cancellation of a potential new game have \"angered\" him. However, he does – jokingly, it seems – suggest that someone like Elon Musk (\"I think he has some money\") could possibly take over the franchise and keep it going.\n\n\nWho better to take the reins on dystopian sci-fi..?\n\n\nWe will likely never know what would have become of Adam Jensen. Toufexis seems certain that, had the studio been working on a new story based around the character, he would have been contacted.\n\n\nHis message is also the culmination of ongoing dismay within the gaming industry, as huge companies make cutbacks, with some studios shutting down entirely. Eidos Montreal is sadly one of the more recent examples of this swathe of job losses.\n\n\nBut it seems Toufexis wants to try and put a more positive spin on things, hoping fans will continue to like his non-Jensen work. Whether we will ever see a new Deus Ex game again remains to be seen, but with Mankind Divided coming up on the eight-year anniversary of its release, a lot of us are more than hungry for a return to this universe.\n\nThe post Deus Ex’s Adam Jensen gives heartfelt thanks to fans amidst Eidos layoffs appeared first on Destructoid.",

And miraculously, somehow, across approximately 588 episodes of Replay, we have never revisited Metal Gear Solid. This week I am happy to correct that monumental mistake.\nWe will get back to Majora's Mask soon (Marcus is out on assignment this week) but we took that opportunity to revisit one of, if not the, best PlayStation games with Metal Gear Solid. It just so happens that Alex Van Aken is playing through the game for fun, so I asked him if we could just jump into his save for an hour. And you know what? It just so happened to be one of the best hours of the whole game. Alex takes out Liquid Snake in the HIND, meets the invisible overweight soldiers, and defeats Sniper Wolf. It's a fantastic snapshot of a fantastic game.\n\n\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

          "description": "Dead Cells was developed and released by Motion Twin in 2018, and in an atypical move in the world of game development, members of that team branched off to form Evil Empire, which in turn supported Dead Cells with new content for many years. Arguably its biggest and most notable expansion was the Return to Castlevania DLC, which added all kinds of Castlevania content to the game.\nThe developer announced this morning, however, that it is officially time to move on. You can see the developer's full statement below.\nAfter 5 years of service, we're hanging up the Dead Cells coat. We're extremely proud of our work on countless updates & DLC, but now it's time for something shiny and new, or maybe more than one thing 😏 More on that very soon...\n#deadcells https://t.co/CqbNvNXGu1 pic.twitter.com/RAz8OL1SCC\nFebruary 9, 2024\nAlong with issuing apologies for any broken controllers related to the Derelict Distillery addition, Evil Empire also shared its appreciation for being able to add so much to Dead Cells. It also wrote, \"The good news is that our Dead Cells team have been unleashed to pump their talent into our secret projects, and we'll be revealing what their crazy minds have been coming up with very soon!\" while also wishing luck to Motion Twin's next announced project, Windblown, and teasing perhaps more than one project.\nFor more on Evil Empire, you can read Game Informer's impressions of the Dead Cells: Return to Castelvania DLC.",

That game, which easily earned Game Informer's Game of the Year in 2016, started with such promise and a massive, enthusiastic audience, but following the 2019 announcement of Overwatch 2, support for the original Overwatch floundered, and so, too, did the community. Last year's release of Overwatch 2's PvE elements in its Invasion update pushed the hero shooter back in the right direction, but it didn't make the splash Blizzard had hoped for. With Overwatch 2 Season 9, which kicks off next week, Blizzard is making a ton of sweeping behind-the-scenes changes to make the game more approachable for players.\nPlayers of all modes will notice updates to how moment-to-moment gameplay, encounters, and matches as a who…",

          "description": "Persona 3 Reload is finally here, and fans of the series have welcomed it with open arms, happily becoming reacquainted with the high schoolers who get magical powers from a shot to the head. Speaking of which, Persona 3 Reload has shot to the head of Atlus's ranking of fastest-selling games, shipping over a million copies worldwide in its first week.\nPersona 3 Reload sold 1,000,000 copies worldwide within its first week, becoming the fastest selling game in ATLUS history! 🎉\npic.twitter.com/C2abDAwCDs\nFebruary 8, 2024\nOriginally released on the PlayStation 2, Persona 3 was the first game in its series to define its modern formula, combining social responsibilities with dungeon crawling and a lengthy, emotional story. It's been re-released multiple times and was even ported to modern consoles last year, but even the upgraded versions don't hold a candle to the mind-bending masterpiece that is Persona 5 Royal. Persona 3 Reload closes that gap, however, introducing overhauled visuals and mechanics to bring the game that started it all up to the level of quality fans of the series have come to expect. If the sales numbers and our glowing review are any indication, the upgrade has been well worth the wait.\nTo put these numbers in context, here are some other games that have recently reached comparable significant milestones: Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth shipped 1 million copies as of Feb 1, Nintendo's quarterly report revealed Tears of the Kingdom has sold 20 million copies, and viral hit Palworld continues to smash record after record.\nHave you checked out Persona 3 Reload yet?

          "description": "Funimation and Crunchyroll, two competing anime streaming services, merged in 2021 and announced in 2022 that all of the content would eventually combine under the Crunchyroll banner. That event officially has a date, and it's April 2.\nFor Funimation subscribers, you will have to go through the process of merging your account before the April 2 date, and, frustratingly, any shows that were outright purchased through Funimation will not transfer to Crunchyroll. Just another reminder that when you purchase digital content, true ownership does not technically exist and you will always be at the mercy of the platform holders when it comes to access.\nCrunchyroll subscribers do not need to make any changes, but the price of the subscription will rise to $100 a year soon. The merger officially going through does mean Crunchyroll will feature more content, but a price increase will always be frustrating.\nAlongside this merger finally completing, Crunchyroll is also entering the video game space as a publisher. It remains to be seen what kind of video tames the anime company will help produce, but you can check out this package it sent over on Game Informer's TikTok account.\nAs a subscriber to both services who somehow has managed to continue to have a need for both (Outlaw Star is curiously currently only available on Funimation) the merger is bittersweet. I embrace the simplicity of one anime streaming service but don't look forward to paying more, and will forever be wary of mergers being a good thing.",

The series officially takes place between the second and third movie and will apparently follow Knuckles (Idris Elba) has he helps Wade (Adam Pally), Tom Wachowski's (James Marsden) bumbling police partner, become a true warrior. The trailer also reveals the antagonist will be played by Rory McCann, who is best known for playing Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane in Game of Thrones, and features a two-thirds Human Giant reunion cameo with Rob Huebel and Paul Scheer.

Jim Carrey does not appear, nor does James Marsden, but both Sonic and Tails appear and are played by film voice actors, Ben Schwarz and Colleen O'Shaughnessey.\n\n\nThe series, simply titled Knuckles, will be six episodes long and begins streaming on April 26 on Paramount+.

          "description": "Project Orion is still a deeply mysterious game. We know it is a follow-up to Cyberpunk 2077, we know CD Projekt Red is developing the game in North America (Boston, specifically) as opposed to Poland where the main studio is based, and eventually development will expand to Vancouver, with support from the main Polish headquarters. Beyond those details, we don't know much. Implications from CD Projekt point to it being a sequel, but it could be a spin-off, or something entirely different. Of note, Project Orion was a study from the 50s and 60s about the viability of nuclear power for space travel. Maybe that's what CD Projekt's Cyberpunk 2077 follow-up will be about.\nWe may not know much about the game, but based on a press release from CD Projekt this morning, we now know some of the folks who will be working on it. Dan Hernberg is now a Project Orion executive producer who was head of production at Amazon Games, and also has history at Panic Button and Blizzard Entertainment.  Ryan Barnard was a game director at Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft, but perhaps most notably, was the gameplay director at Hitman for developer IO Interactive. Barnard is joining Project Orion as a design director. Alan Villani is now an engineering director on Project Orion and worked on several Mortal Kombat titles. Anna Megill is a Project Orion lead writer with history on titles like Control, Dishonored: Death of The Outsider, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Guild Wars 2, and the upcoming Fable from Playground Games. Alexander Freed is an additional writer on Project Orion and is a New York Times bestselling novelist and comic book writer who previously worked at Bioware on Star Wars: The Old Republic and more.\nWe're eager to learn more about Project Orion, but suspect it will be some time before we do.

          "description": "Microsoft had a strong start to 2024 thanks to their Developer Direct Showcase, but it sounds like we'll get even more information on what the gaming giant is up to very soon. Head of Xbox Phil Spencer gathered the attention of gamers everywhere this afternoon with a post announcing an upcoming \"business update event.\" You can see the post for yourself below.\nWe're listening and we hear you. We've been planning a business update event for next week, where we look forward to sharing more details with you about our vision for the future of Xbox. Stay tuned.\nFebruary 5, 2024\nThe post itself doesn't have any concrete details on what to expect, but there's a likely subject. Just this morning, The Verge reported that Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, one of Xbox's biggest first-party games of the year, might be headed to PlayStation after a short exclusivity window. Combined with other recent rumors, like Hi-Fi Rush and Starfield coming to other platforms, it seems like Xbox might be loosening its grip on its exclusive games. That said, Spencer didn't give us any idea as to what the announcement would be about, so we'll have to wait until next week to know for sure.\nFor more on Xbox's plans for the coming year, check out some of the reveals from the Developer Direct, like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Visions of Mana, and Avowed.\nWhat do you think Xbox will announce next week?

In addition to touting an AI learning opponent feature for Master Duel and VR experience with Duel Links, a collection of classic Yu-Gi-Oh titles served as the big new game announcement.\nDubbed Yu-Gi-Oh! Early Days Collection, this compilation consists of the very first Yu-Gi-Oh games ever released, including titles only available in Japan. Konami only revealed one game in the collection: Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Monsters 4: Battle of Great Duelists for the Game Boy Color, which launched in Japan in 2000 and never came to the West. \nYu-Gi-Oh Early Days Collection has no release window, but it will be available for Switch and PC via Steam. Konami plans to announce the other titles in the collection in the future, so you can start building your wishlist now. There are a ton of Yu-Gi-Oh games (to say the least), but as a long-time fan, I’ll be happy if Forbidden Memories, The Eternal Duelist Soul, or (perhaps less likely) The Duelists of the Roses make the cut.",

          "description": "Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is one of the biggest Xbox exclusives on the horizon. According to a new report, however, Microsoft might be thinking of bringing Indy to other platforms.\nThe Verge has spoken to an insider familiar with Microsoft’s plans who claims the publisher is considering the idea of bringing several first-party titles to other consoles, like releasing Indiana Jones on the PlayStation 5. The source claims that Bethesda is tentatively targeting a December release for the title and that it will launch as an Xbox/PC title before possibly coming to PlayStation 5 after a short exclusivity window. \n\n\nRemember that nothing has been officially announced or confirmed, so take this report with a grain of salt. It’s worth noting, though, that during Microsoft’s trial with the FTC over its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Bethesda’s then head of publishing, Pete Hines, testified that parent company ZeniMax had initially signed an agreement with Disney to make Indiana Jones a multiplatform game. Microsoft later amended this deal to make the game an Xbox exclusive after it acquired ZeniMax in 2020, with Hines explaining the decision was made in the name of \"reducing risk and trying to get a degree of clarity.\"\nMicrosoft’s rumored multi-platform approach has garnered plenty of speculation in recent months. The publisher is reportedly looking to bring first-party games like Hi-Fi Rush and Sea of Thieves to rival platforms in the near future. Starfield is also rumored for a PS5 launch, as reported by XboxEra. \nIndiana Jones and the Great Circle was first announced in 2021 and had its full reveal during the Xbox Developer Direct last month. The first-person action-adventure romp stars Troy Baker as Indy in a story set between Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade. The game is slated to launch sometime this year for Xbox Series X/S and PC. \n[Source: The Verge]",

While various action scenes served as fan-pleasing sequences, the series was maligned among the community for simply not feeling true to the source material. In addition to focusing on too many side characters and interpersonal drama, the series also took far too many liberties with its main protagonist, Master Chief. With Season 2 starting on Paramount+ this week, I sat down with Xbox's head of IP expansion and entertainment Kiki Wolfkill and Halo Season 2 showrunner and writer David Wiener to learn more about the direction they're taking.\nAccording to Wolfkill, who has worked on the Halo series since her role as executive producer on Halo 4 in 2012, …",

Early looks made it seem like a pleasant environmental puzzle game about a pair of brothers going on an adventure, but actually playing the game showcased an impressive and specific point of view from its creator, Josef Fares. You can read Game Informer's review of the original Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons by following the link. The game was both heartwarming and heartbreaking, and to this day still features some of the best examples of gameplay as storytelling, and it's all done without any proper dialogue. After Brothers' release, Fares went on to found Hazelight, the studio behind A Way Out and It Takes Two.\nNow, 10 years later, developer Avantgarden Games is preparing to release a remake of the game on February 28 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Join Marcus Stewart and me as we take a look at the new version and reminisce about the original.\nAnd for more on Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, read our in-depth Afterwords on the game with Josef Fares from 2013 here.\n\n\nHead over to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

          "description": "Today's announcement of Sonic x Shadow Generations brought all kinds of love for Sonic's dark doppelganger as longtime fans celebrate Shadow's return after being absent from recent projects like Sonic Superstars and Sonic Frontiers. However, players won't need to wait for the fall launch of Sonic x Shadow Generations to enjoy speeding around as Shadow, as Sega also announced it is celebrating today's announcement by releasing a free equippable DLC costume to Sonic Superstars on February 15.\nSonic Superstars already includes several other skins you can equip onto your characters, ranging from Lego costumes to a Santa costume for Sonic to even the original prototype rabbit design. No screenshots or photos have been released for the newly announced Shadow costume in Sonic Superstars.\nIn July 2023, I asked Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka why Shadow isn't in Sonic Superstars. \"Shadow is from the Modern series of characters and gameplay that we have introduced,\" Iizuka says. \"The Classic series exists before the Modern series, so they haven't met at that time. There's no relationship, so we won't be bringing Shadow into the Classic series. Unfortunately, Shadow was in a capsule at that time.\"\nBy adding Shadow as an equippable skin, Iizuka and the rest of Sonic Team are able to circumvent the lore reasoning for leaving Shadow on the sidelines for Superstars. This year is shaping up to be the Year of Shadow for the Sonic brand. Shadow is coming to Sonic Superstars as an equippable skin, he's co-headlining the aforementioned Sonic Generations remaster in the fall, and he figures to be one of the main attractions in the upcoming Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film when that hits theaters in December.\nSonic Superstars launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on October 17, 2023. The free Shadow costume arrives in Sonic Superstars as free DLC on February 15. For more on that game, check out our review here. You can also visit our exclusive coverage hub by heading here.",

The news was announced during today’s State of Play.\nThe game, which first entered Steam Early Access in May 2022, puts players in the immortal shoes of a weak vampire who awakens after slumbering for centuries. Players must regain their strength and rebuild their castle, which, among other things, involves enslaving humans to do their bidding. Whatever your method of rebuilding your might and fending off foes, you’ll have to plan around a day/night cycle since sunlight is a big no-no for your well being. V Rising can be played alone or alongside friends in multiplayer. \n\n\nInterestingly, since Sony doesn't have an Early Access style program, one has to wonder if V Rising’s arrival will coincide with an impending 1.0 launch on PC. V Rising was a big hit when it first arrived on Steam and has garnered positive reviews, so here's hoping the experience translates well on console.",

Not only that, but it is, as Kojima put it, an \"action espionage\" game.\nIf that genre sounds vaguely familiar in relation to Kojima, that might be because the tagline of his global breakthrough, Metal Gear Solid, released in 1998, used the tagline \"Tactical Espionage Action.\" In normal people's terms, that means a stealth game. \n\n\nKojima's return to the stealth genre, one he pioneered decades ago with the Metal Gear series, is still quite a ways off. As he tells it, development will begin in earnest after Death Stranding 2 is released sometime in 2025. \nHe then went on to say a bunch of stuff that didn't make a ton of sense, though maybe one day it will in retrospect. This new game will also apparently be a movie \"in terms of look, story, theme, cast, acting, fashion, and sound,\" Kojima said, before adding that with this new game, Kojima Productions hopes to \"transcend the barriers between film and video games.\"",

Whether you're slaying beasts with swords and axes or blasting them with magic, Dragon's Dogma 2 looks as thrilling as fans would expect. \n\n\nDragon’s Dogman 2 launches on March 22 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

          "description": "OpenTTD turns 20 this year, and to celebrate we are preparing for one of our largest ever releases. It’s packed with 40 new features, 80 changes, and almost 150 fixes. In the upcoming weeks we will share more posts explaining some of these features in depth. For now, we need your help testing our work. We need as many people as possible to test this beta version of the 14.X release series, so you can find and we can squash as many bugs as possible before the actual release. To guide you a bit towards what you should be looking for: Generic gameplay bugs and crashes. There is a new Ship Pathfinder; test it out. Buoys are optional to use. You can now automatically unbunch your vehicles at a depot. We added our own interpretation of daylength to the game. More on this soon in another blog post. There are many GUI improvements throughout the game. More consistent look, better GUI scaling. There are many more things worth talking about, and this will be made more clear when we approach the release of 14.0. But for now, play the game, and please report any issues you find. The usual titlegame competition has also been announced on the forums. See the page for the exact competition rules if you are interested. Download Changelog Bug tracker",

For details of bugs fixed in each preview\nrelease, see previous entries on this blog.\nAccess real devices with Device Streaming in Android Studio\n\nDevice streaming in Android Studio lets you securely connect to remote physical Android devices hosted in Google's secure data centers. Powered by Firebase, it's the fastest and easiest way to test your app against real devices, including the Google Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, select Samsung devices, and more.\n\nAfter connecting to a device, you can deploy your app, view the display, interact with the device (including rotating or unfolding the device), and anything else you might do with a device over a direct ADB over SSL connection—all without leaving Android Studio. When you're done using the device, Google wipes all your data and factory resets the device before making it available to another developer.\nDuring Open Alpha, you can use Device Streaming at no cost. To get started simply sign into your Developer account from Android Studio and select a Firebase project. If you don't already have a Firebase project, it's easy to create one. To learn more, go to Device Streaming in Android Studio.\n\nGeneral fixes and features\nBelow is a list of general fixes in Android Studio Jellyfish | 2023.3.1 Canary 9 and Android Gradle Plugin 8.4.0-alpha09 These are a result of your bug \nreports, which help us to make Android Studio better.
