Like many ports from the PS4 and Xbox One, there was always a concern that Netherrealm Studio’s cinematic fighter wouldn’t be able to cut it on Nintendo’s hybrid console. Still, with 60fps performance and all the content you could possibly want, it proved to be a more-than-competent option for Switch owners.\nIts direct sequel and semi-reboot, Mortal Kombat 1, aims to crank everything up a couple of notches, boasting stunning visuals and an expanded combat system that lets you call in additional ‘Kameo’ fighters to assist you in battle. After the gameplay reveal at Summer Game Fest, we managed to go hands-on with Netherrealm’s latest effort for roughly 30 minutes and came away utterly gobsmacked. And, honestly? It makes us worried about the Switch version.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

An improvement on the creators found in previous Bethesda games, there's nothing here that looks particularly innovative compared to other open-world games of this ilk.

To skip to the end: it looks a lot like past Paydays, inasmuch as it's a co-op first-person shooter that's less about clever breaking and entering and more about mowing down waves of cops. \r\n\nThe trailer also came with a release date: September 21st.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Like lots of people in the RPS Treehouse right now, I've been squeezing in bits of Diablo 4 around the various Summer Game Fest streams happening this week. I'm having a decent, if mildly monotonous time so far, mostly because I haven't unlocked all my Druid's abilities just yet, but I'm keen to keep going with it, mostly because I just like turning into a bear and a wolf every three seconds to whack some evil skelly boys, innit. When I was logging off the other day, though, I had a fleeting glance at Diablo 4's shop. Not to actually buy anything, I should stress. I'm not one for cosmetics in any shape or form. But I just wanted to see what ludicrous things it was trying to sell me for real human money. And one item for sale was, of course, some fancy horse armour, and it cost six English pounds and thirty nine pence. £6.39! For a mangey rope bridle and a bone dagger on its side! (You can see it in the header image up top there). Ridiculous, I exclaimed, and promptly shut down my PC. \nThe next morning, I was talking about this daft bit of armour with the RPS Treehouse when Alice0 suddenly introduced me to the weird and wonderful world of cheap horse games on Steam. After all, why spend upwards of £6 on a pointless cosmetic item when you could feasibly put that money toward 6 whole horse games that have actually dozens of horses in them? So join me as we discover how many horse games you can buy on Steam for the same price as Diablo 4's horse armour. \nRead more",

Civilization: Beyond Earth, Galactic Civilizations 3, Age Of Wonders 3, and Endless Legend made 2014 an incredibly strong year for strategy games, but nowadays, who really still plays these older entries?\nI don't mean to sound derisive. It's a sombre truth. At 233 hours, I've put more time into Endless Legend than any other 4X strategy game in my Steam library, and loved every minute of it. To this day it's still the best in the genre when it comes to sparking the imagination of my chronically fantasy-loving brain. The music, the amazing variety in terrain and units, the sheer quantity of words bringing to life every last quest, minor faction, creature, and environmental anomaly. It's a simply splendid game. The question is whether it's still worth playing today.\n Read more",

I got to see a sneak peak of it back in March at GDC, but I've been sworn to secrecy ever since. But at long last, Saltsea Chronicles has made its debut at tonight's Day Of The Devs stream, and I can finally unburden myself and let out 90 days' worth of fizz pop excitement for this gorgeous new adventure game. \nSet on a flooded, post-apocalyptic Earth, creative director Hannah Nicklin described it to me like this: \"What if you were watching Star Trek, but you get to choose where they go, who's on the adventure and what they get to say?\" It's a tantalising premise, especially when it's all packaged up in the same crisp, pastel colour palette as the perpetually stunning Mutazione. The Star Trek reference isn't just for show, either. You might only be visiting different islands rather than whole planets during the course of Saltsea Chronicles, but it does have a natty, Alexander Courage-grade theme tune that plays between its chapters. The most exciting thing about this oceanic trek, however, is its incredibly cool save system that lets you dip in and out of different story branches to explore different paths and opportunities as you see fit. Let me tell you all about it.\nRead more",

It's out on July 20th, so not too far away. Have I played it yet? No! Of course not! But we're getting closer to a hands on, and after a six-minute video of the magic FPS in action last month, tonight's Summer Game Fest threw us a big, bombastic boss fight on top of a steampunk Jaeger, or something. I dunno, it was hard to tell over the light show. Those sure are a lot of magical fireworks going off. I like it. Jangle some more keys in front of me, games man.\n\nThe video itself is, uh, well, it's not long, and it's quite choppy. While I enjoy a good setpiece, my concerns remain the same as before, i.e. the magic shooting, despite the different flavours of magic broadly corresponding to a different kind of gun, looks pretty weightless, and the enemies look bullet spongey. I do like the colours and the traversal, though.\n Read more",

Well, Geoff and his freshly pressed Summer Game Fest trainers have only gone and done it for them, and wouldn't you know it, it's a new Prince Of Persia game called The Lost Crown. Sorry, Sands Of Time Remake, you're old news now.\nBut even before Geoff got his pristine reveal mitts on it (probably), I went to see and play this new Prince Of Persia game over at Ubisoft Montpellier - and if the reveal trailer hasn't already convinced you this is something special, take it from me: this is rad as heck, and you can read more of my thoughts about it after its full reveal at Ubisoft Forward next Monday. Until then, though, here's everything else I can share about it right now, so ready yourselves for some cold, hard factoids. Here we go.\nRead more",

But with so many of these games jumping over to console, I decided to give it a go this year and I'm glad I did. Because had I skipped the show, I likely wouldn't have learned about Parcel Corps.\nFrom developer Billy Goat Entertainment and publisher Secret Mode, Parcel Corps puts players in the shoes of a freelance bike messenger who must make their deliveries before time runs out. The game takes place on New Island where three delivery companies are just waiting to pay you the least amount of money legally possible to do your job. That's the gig economy for you, baby!\nWhile making deliveries is the name of the game, players can also pull off some sick tricks on the halfpipes and ramps scattered across the city's nine areas, terrify rooftop pigeons, and, if they're in the mood, overthrow a totalitarian government.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sso5T3ovzmE\nCheesy trailer aside, Parcel Corps certainly has my attention with its colorful world, inviting gameplay, and anti-capitalistic messaging. I mean, the villain of the game is named Rich Villainé. That alone makes me want to play this just so I can knock that fucker down a few notches.\nLike a lot of the games revealed today, Parcel Corps will arrive in 2024 on an unspecified date. When it does land, the game will release for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.\nThe post Parcel Corps is going to give me some killer calves appeared first on Destructoid.",

After a stellar debut last year, in which it won Best Game at the British Academy Games Awards and the Destructoid award for Best PC Game, the developer is showing no signs of slowing down support for the game. So far, it's seen two paid DLC expansions and several free updates. Its next free arrives tomorrow, and it's packing in some great reason to return to the monster-infested fields of Italy.\nDubbed the \"Overwhelming Update,\" Vampire Survivors version 1.5 adds new features, new levels, a new game mode, and half a new character. The new stage, Astral Stair, is a near-endless series of corridors featuring flying paintings and a new spinning wheel that'll trigger random events within the stage. The character Yatta Cavallo is getting a new form in the update, and the new relic GoldFinger will start a limited-time challenge where your character is powerful and invisible for a brief amount of time. If you care about achievements, the update is adding six of those to the game too.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIQv7sWPBu0\nIgnore what it says in the trailer about the update being available now.

          "description": "Bah fun(?)-bug\nA Christmas Carol is a timeless classic that remains a staple of the holiday season, with producers in film and television taking advantage of its public domain status every couple of years to pop out another version of the story that'll never be as good as Scrooged or The Muppet Christmas Carol. I've seen plenty of productions of it during my near-40 years on this Earth, but I don't think I've ever seen the story tackled in a video game.\nPerhaps that's why Ebenezer and the Invisible World was the most amusingly confounded trailer at the PC Gaming Show. From Orbit Studio and Play on Worlds, Invisible World tells the story of what happens after the ghosts helped Scrooge become a new man. I'm not sure if Dickens ever planned for a sequel, but I have to imagine if he did write one, it wouldn't have had the geezer down-kicking bad guys or using the power of the ghost of Haley Hall to pass through ethereal gates.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmo07RJg2Aw\nI'm not going to say I'm sold on the idea of reinventing one of literature's most famous tales as a metroidvania, but it's certainly a lot more interesting than just turning into a horror game. Plus, the holiday setting is charming, and the hand-drawn environments are scrumptious.\nEbenezer and the Invisible World is in development for PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch. Hopefully, it can make it to storefronts before Christmas. A 15 GB demo of the game is now live on Steam.\nThe post Sure, why not, a metroidvania where you play as Ebenezer Scrooge appeared first on Destructoid.",

The team went from the Microsoft-published horror experience into the realms of Quantum Break and Control, and all the while, the writer has been waiting. With Alan Wake 2, it feels like Remedy is returning to the series with both new concepts and ideas built over the years since Wake's first venture.\nIn a hands-off demo of Alan Wake 2 at Summer Game Fest 2023, I got to see an extended look at just how that adventure will play out. The first big note is that Alan Wake 2 will feature two protagonists, with different viewpoints and sets of missions. Alan Wake returns, but in the session we saw, we followed Saga Anderson—an FBI agent and profiler who's looking into a series of ritualistic murders in B…",

Microsoft took to the stage in Los Angeles for its dual-header of the Xbox Games Showcase 2023 and its Starfield Direct. The first half is all about Xbox, between its first-party and third-party offerings, while the latter puts the lens squarely on Bethesda's impending RPG.\nThe summer may be a little off this year without E3, but today's show felt strong to me. Maybe it's the sheer variety, from new originals to first-party reveals. Or maybe it's that, even with some leaks, Xbox managed to get a few moments of surprise. As far as trailer-bonanzas go, I feel like it was a good one. A lot of the games are aimed towards 2024, though.\nStill, with a big Cyberpunk update and the massi…",

As the title might imply, Clockwork Revolution will focus heavily on time travel. Fargo promises both \"dynamic time-bending combat\" and a plot centered around the gimmick. It looks like players will find themselves traveling to the past and making choices that will affect the future in substantial ways.\nThe post notes the team is \"pushing roleplaying reactivity to new heights\" with this game, so we'll have to see how much player choice impacts the final product.\nThat said, don't expect to see Clockwork Revolution anytime soon. The post clarifies that the game is \"still early in development,\" and that this is just a sneak peak. The trailer says the game will \"come in due time,\" so we'll stay tuned to learn more.\nAt the very least, some of you may wind up with Clockwork Revolution whether you like it or not.

Cities Skylines 2 has gotten an actual in-game trailer and a release date for October 24th.\nOh, yeah. This is a good trailer. It shows off the upgraded visuals of Cities Skylines 2, and a UI which is a mix of familiar and new. There are exciting features like being able to build both roads of a divided highway at the same time. I don’t know how to make that sound exciting, but trust me, it’s amazing. It shows a number of other improved traffic-related upgrades. You can just make grids of roads now, but I hope you’re not an individual who just sticks to grid designs for cities. I expect better from you.\nhttps://youtu.be/QZW39Yml3a8\nBeyond that, the engine once again looks nicer, but absolutely familiar. However, if there’s one thing that gets my blood pumping, it’s weather effects. Cities Skylines had snow, but you were essentially just picking a snow-city map, and that was about it. Your city was just a snow-city. A brief moment in the trailer shows snow accumulating. Again, this might be something that a normal person doesn’t get, but it absolutely gets me excited.\nI thankfully don’t have to wait too long. Cities Skylines 2 is coming October 24, 2024.

The DLC is available to pre-order now on all platforms, priced at $29.99 or local equivalent.\nAnyone pre-ordering the Phantom Liberty DLC will receive a bonus item in the form of a snazzy muscle car, the Quadra Vigilante. This car will unlock at the start of the expansion and ensure that V is looking pretty damn ace as they whiz their way around Night City. The new DLC will open up a brand new district in the hazardous 'berg, and will also star Idris Elba as FIA agent Soloman Reed.\nThe Phantom Liberty expansion DLC was expected to arrive a little closer to Cyberpunk 2077's 2020 launch, but production was slowed as the developer instead focused on polishing the original release, which famously received one of the most notoriously disappointing launches (at least technically) in the modern gaming sphere. Cyberpunk 2077 has since launched on Gen9 platforms PS5 and Xbox Series X, and is generally considered to be in a far cleaner, higher-quality state.\nCyberpunk 2077 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty DLC launches September 26 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The story concerns a party of school students who uncover a temporal anomaly known as \"The Dark Hour\". The students in question form the \"Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad\" (SEES), with the aim of getting to the root of the anomaly and the strange creatures that lay within.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIIPXA2A6cM&ab_channel=Xbox\nPersona 3 was praised for its vivid visual style, attractive and likable cast of characters, and wild soundtrack. The marriage of dungeon-crawler with supah-anime social sim was a huge hit, and would lead to greater success in sequels Persona 4 and Persona 5, as well as an array of multi-genre spin-offs.

I mean, you play as a lady-rogue, who is young, spunky, and wanted by the Empire. She drives a speederbike and has something that looks like a furry axolotl. She also flies what is the ugliest looking ship I’ve seen in the Star Wars Universe, and in a galaxy full of space-pickles, that says a lot.\nhttps://youtu.be/pTcvtSfDkCM\nSo we’re not given much to go on in terms of what kind of game Star Wars: Outlaws will be. It's apparently open-world. Wait \"First open world Star Wars game?\" That's absolutely stretching it, Ubisoft.\nI’m choosing to believe that this is a crossover between Star Wars and the 1997 LucasArts FPS Outlaws.

Utilizing his telescopic limbs, Bella Bowman battles an army of minions across 33 stages, gathering powerups, defeating bosses, and receiving occasional assistance from his super-heroic friend, Lottery Man.\nCheck out the very sill action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber World of Longplays.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSKS5U5b9o4\nOn release, Transcendent Lovers Bella Bowman was highly praised for its colorful and satirical visuals, cute animation, as well as its fun score, and use of pressure-sensitive buttons, (which frequently broke). Today, however, it's frankly pretty terrible, although there is no denying the absolute charm with which it depicts the tokusatsu aesthetic.\nWhile frustratingly difficult and not a whole lot of fun, it's still pleasing that this rarity is now finally available in the Arcade Archive catalog, as it represents not only a window into gaming culture, but also one of Japanese pop culture. As such, it retains a level of intrinsic value in spite of its gameplay shortcomings.\nTranscendent Lovers Bella Bowman is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Transcendent Lovers Bella Bowman brings its gorgeous name to the Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

And so many people up here – [head of Xbox Game Studios] Matt [Booty] and [corporate vice president] Sarah [Bond] – have spent a lot of time leading and strategizing and thinking about where we are.

Today's PC Gaming Show gave us an exciting update, and much sooner than we might have expected: Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector is currently in development.\n\n\nThe sequel takes place in the same world as the last, \"some time\" after the events Citizen Sleeper. As an escaped android with a malfunctioning body, you'll have to gather a crew, command a ship, and do what it takes to stay alive. If you want to keep an eye out for future updates, the game already has a Steam page.\nIf this game is anything like its predecessor, we're all in for a treat. We were big fans of the original Citizen Sleeper, with its inspired story and narrative mechanics leading to our reviewer calling it \"a game I'll be thinking about for years to come.\" It also scored a spot on our Top Ten Games of 2022.",

To set things right, you’ll travel back to key moments in the past where your actions have a butterfly effect on the Avalon’s future. Hopping between the past and an ever-changing present shows off the game's complex choice-driven storytelling and reactive role-playing, as you'll meet various versions of characters depending on how you tinker with time. \n\n\nThe game is described as featuring a “deep, narrative-driven world” while the action unfolds in the form of first-person gunplay using steam-powered firearms as well as time-bending technology, such as reversing the time-flow of objects. \nClockwork Revolution is being developed by inXile Entertainment, makers of the Wasteland and A Bard’s Tale series, and is coming “in due time” to Xbox Series X/S and PC. It will launch on Game Pass.",

The accompanying voiceover suggests that the story involves the lead character traveling to an area of Eora called the Living Lands – a part of the world established in the Pillars game as a diverse island to the north characterized by strange weather patterns and strange creatures. The player character arrives as an envoy of the emperor of Aedyr, to look into rumors of an unnatural plague.\nAvowed is coming to Xbox and PC in 2024. Check out the full trailer below.",

A young woman pays a visit to inquire about a dangerous monster, which attempts to ambush her until she retaliates by weaving a seemingly magical web to subdue it. There's no gameplay, and the trailer's description describes South of Midnight as a \"fantastical and macabre third-person action-adventure set in the American Deep South.\"\n\n\nSouth of Midnight has no release window, but it’s coming to PC and Xbox Series X/S and will launch on Game Pass.",

The game is being developed by Massive Entertainment, a Ubisoft studio known for making The Division and The Division 2. The cinematic reveal trailer didn't show any gameplay, instead relying on cgi cutscenes to set the mood of the world, showing a young woman on the run from a bounty hunter. You can watch it for yourself below.\n\n\nThe description of the trailer on YouTube offers some more concrete details about the game.\n\"Experience the first-ever open world Star Wars game, set between the events of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi,\" the description says. \"Explore distinct planets across the galaxy, both iconic and new. Risk it all as Kay Vess, an emerging scoundrel seeking freedom and the means to start a new life, along with her companion Nix. Fight, steal, and outwit your way through the galaxy’s crime syndicates as you join the galaxy’s most wanted.\"\nWhile the new title isn't out until 2024, we'll be learning more about it at Ubisoft's showcase tomorrow.

The trailer (but not the full game, presumably) stars Richard Ayoade of The IT Crowd fame as Dave commiserating about the age of heroes being over and the age of agriculture being the future. In a twist, however, it is revealed that Ayoade's character is a giant fending off heroes who are trying to invade his home.\n\n\nFrom there an action sequence begins with a hero outrunning the giant Ayoade. It is revealed in the end that the hero has defeated the giant by show of them sitting on his shattered glasses. The trailer's description on YouTube shares that this new entry will continue to take place in Albion.\nNo release date was revealed, but the game will be available on Game Pass day one.",

This open-world adventure gives players the power to remove textures from the environment itself to slap on other objects, opening the door for some inventive puzzle-solving.\nAs Ruffy, you’re the chosen one with the power of Swap. That means you can mix and match elements of the world as you see fit. Need to climb up a mountain? Rip that patch of vines off a wall and slap it over a waterfall to create an instant climbing path. Change the time of day by switching out the sun and moon. Turn a heavy stone into a floating platform by replacing it with a wood texture. Copy and paste are your best friends and seemingly allow for a number of creative solutions to Riverside's many challenges. \n\n\nIn addition to a primary story campaign, you’ll tackle sidequests given by the colorful residents. Speaking of color, the world sports a great-looking papercraft art direction. Thankfully, we shouldn’t have to wait terribly long to explore Ruffy and the Riverside since it launches later this year for Switch and PC (with other consoles to be announced later).",

Players guide three very different characters – a samurai, a Kodama spirit, and a cat – on a journey to save Japan from invading Oni. As the samurai Takeshi and the much smaller Kodoma, you’ll hack apart undead soldiers and supernatural foes from Japanese mythology. As the cat, platforming and stealth are the names of the game, as you’ll avoid enemies such as one, particularly toothy and terrifying-looking demon. \nThe Spirit of the Samurai has been in the works for a few years by developer Digital Mind Games and arrives in 2024 for PC.",

          "description": "After years wallowing in purgatory, 2011's Shadow of the Damned is getting another shot in the limelight via a remaster. On top of that, developer Grasshopper Manufacture is holding its own E3-style presentation next week.\nShadows of the Damned was the product of a collaboration between Grasshopper's Goichi Suda (AKA Suda51), who wrote the game, and Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami, who served as a producer. It's a third-person shooter about demon hunter Garcia Hotspur, who must rescue his girlfriend after she's abducted by the forces of the underworld with the help of his trusty phallic-joke loving demon, Johnson. The game's bombastic, supernatural action and absurd sense of humor made it generally well-liked upon release (We scored it a 9.25 out of 10 in our review), but it has never been ported beyond its original platforms on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. That's about to change.\n\n\nThe humorous trailer doesn't reveal any details about the remaster, but we'll likely learn more at the inaugural Grasshopper Direct on June 14. The event celebrates the studios 25th anniversary and kicks off at 9 p.m. PT/12 a.m. ET, so fans in the U.S. will have to brew an extra cup of coffee if they want to catch the event live. \nAre you a fan of Shadows of the Damned or does this remaster entice you to give it a shot?

Join us today Friday on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist). \nBanjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey. \nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

However, the game will still be playable for those who own it through at least the following year, meaning up to December 31, 2024. Until then, the base price of the game will be dropped to $4.99, and each piece of DLC will cost $0.99. \npic.twitter.com/n52hJPUxwx\nJune 8, 2023\n\nFriday the 13th: The Game pits a team of players controlling Camp Crystal Lake counselors working together to survive against a player-controlled Jason Voorhees. The game didn’t arrive to the warmest reception when it launched in 2017, but it’s always a bummer to see games disappear, especially when it's at the mercy of IP licensing. Even before this final blow, the game had a rocky existence due to legal disputes with the film's original creators halting the distribution of DLC and, later, the eventual shutdown of its dedicated servers. \nWhat did you think of Friday the 13th: The Game?

A lenghty trailer gave us some good looks at its gameplay, story, as well as a much-anticipated release window. \nThe story sees Cloud and the gang explore beyond Midgar to stop Sephiroth’s plans, and we see looks at the grander Final Fantasy VII story, likely to be laden with new twists. In terms of new faces, get to see Elena join Reno and Rude in the Turks, and Yuffie, the fiery Wutai ninja introduced in the Intermission story expansion, officially joins the party. \n\n\nPerhaps the most surprising revelation is that Rebirth will come on two discs. Given how much storage a single Blu-ray can hold, that suggests that Rebirth could be a mammoth-sized experience, which is wild given that it’s only Part 2 of a planned trilogy of games. We also now know that Rebirth is coming in early 2024 exclusively to PlayStation 5.",

As you might expect, this mainly means he's beating the holy hell out of dudes in the street. The trailer shows a variety of large-scale fights, as well as Kiryu's new fighting abilities, which include a rope-type weapon he can use to bring items and people closer to him.\nCheck out the trailer below:\n\n\nAs pointed out by Gematsu, Gaiden gameplay details actually leaked yesterday on the PlayStation Store. Here are some of the key details:\n\"Dynamically switch between the Yakuza and Agent fighting styles in visceral melee combat.\n\"With the Yakuza style, strike fear into enemies by unleashing wildly aggressive moves powered by Kiryu’s unparalleled strength and flair.\n\"Or up the ante with the Agent style by delivering blows with absolute speed and precision, while using an array of high-tech gadgets like electrified bind wires to stun enemies then send them flying.\n\"Strategically adapt to the situation and leverage both styles to dominate and destroy hordes of enemies.\"\n\"Whether you’re brawling in the secret Castle arena, singing a new karaoke song, enjoying a drink at the live-action cabaret club, or racing in the pocket circuit, the world offers a variety of immersive experiences.\n\"An intriguing informant named Akame also provides thrilling sub-missions, drawing you into an epic showdown that unfolds the more you explore and enjoy Sotenbori, Yokohama and the mysterious Castle.\"\nLike A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name will be released on November 9, 2023.",

Today during Summer Game Fest, Second Dinner's Chief Development Officer Ben Brode took to the stage to announce that Conquest, Marvel Snap's newest mode, will launch on June 13. The news was accompanied by a promotional skit featuring SungWon Cho, who you might recognize as Ratatoskr from God of War: Ragnarök. You can watch the trailer below.\n\n\nConquest Mode works similarly to Marvel Snap's Battle Mode. Two players are matched up for a series of games, each with ten units of health. Instead of wagering cubes, the currency players use to gain levels in the standard ranked mode, Conquest will have players wagering health. Unlike Battle Mode, which ends as soon as one player runs out of health, Conquest has players progress through tiers of competition, requiring longer winning streaks the higher they get. As a reward for making it to the top, players will receive exclusive cosmetics.\n“It’s just insane how good players have gotten at Marvel Snap since we launched in the fall,\" Brode said in a press release. \"For our most competitive, high-skilled players, we wanted to give them the ultimate challenge with Conquest. Players can now find out who truly is the best of the best and worthy of ultimate Marvel Snap glory!! What’s also super cool about Conquest is that the Proving Grounds can double as a great way to try out new decks, as Conquest has no impact on a player's Marvel Snap season rank.\"\nMarvel Snap recently started its \"Spider-Versus\" season, which will introduce new cards such as Ghost-Spider, Spider-Ham, and Silk. The game is currently available on PC and Mobile devices and made it onto the list of our top ten games of 2022.",

Isaacs will take the role of Lord Enver Gortash, designer of the Steel Watchers, magical warriors tasked with protecting Baldur’s Gate after Duke Ravengard vanishes. Players will bump heads with this powerful enforcer as they find themselves in the middle of a power struggle engulfing the city. You can see his introduction in the trailer below. \n\n\n\"It was a thrill to join the Baldur’s Gate universe but I fear that the magnificent Lord Enver Gortash is being mischaracterized as a villain,\" says Isaacs in a press release. \"In a brutal world of betrayals and butchery, he’s learned to lie better and backstab first. The joy in voicing him - apart from the obvious pleasure in getting to look so glorious - was that the creative team and I got to play loose enough to find ways that he could enjoy the ride and make the players hate him more!\"\nIsaac isn’t the only famous name players will encounter.

          "description": "Sega and Sonic Team have announced Sonic Superstars, a new 2D adventure starring the company's Blue Blur. Though Sonic is the star, as the name implies, there are plenty of supporting cast members. In this reveal trailer, we also see Tails, Knuckles, and Amy appear as playable characters, each with their own unique abilities.\nFor the first time since Sonic Adventure, original Sonic the Hedgehog designer and artist Naoto Ohshima returns to the franchise. As the original designer of the Sonic the Hedgehog and Dr. Eggman characters, he will bring an all-new character to the franchise through Sonic Superstars. \nSonic Superstars also introduces seven different Emerald Powers. In the trailer, we see Sonic create clones of himself and climb waterfalls, but the press release also teases \"powering up.\" \nTaking place on the North Star Islands, Sonic Superstars purports to deliver never-before-seen environments, hinting that, despite the compilation-style name, we will be speeding through all new levels instead of the usual suspects like Green Hill and Chemical Plant. The press release teases enormous creatures and evil plans from Dr. Eggman, while Fang the Sniper (AKA Nack the Weasel) from Sonic Triple Trouble, Sonic the Fighters, and other games seems to appear as a secondary enemy.\nIn the trailer, we also see what look to be Special Stages that borrow from the rotating Special Stages from Sonic 1, plus a 3D Special Stage. The modernized HD graphics look great in motion, but the proof will be in how it plays, particularly following how disappointed many in the community were by Sonic the Hedgehog 4. If Sonic Team is able to nail the physics, momentum, and overall feel, Sonic Superstars could do for the 2D Sonic series what New Super Mario Bros. did for the 2D Mario series.\nSonic Superstars releases both digitally and physically for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC this fall, and will start at $60.",

But all is not what it seems in the world of Varn...\nThe ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for the PC version of the first game of the Might and Magic series: Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Two modes are supported:\nThe original look and feel of the game (sound, which in the original consisted of merely the occasional beep, is not supported)\nA ScummVM-exclusive enhanced mode, which uses the interface of the later Xeen games, including niceties such as better character screens, automapping, and sound effects. It also integrates the impressive \"Might and Magic 1 Graphics Overhaul Mod\", which provides better in-game map and monster graphics. The xeen.cc file is required from Might and Magic: IV or Might and Magic: World of Xeen.\nBoth modes allow saving your game anywhere outside of combat via the ScummVM Global Main Menu (unlike the original game that only saved a single roster when checking into an inn). So make sure you save regularly, just in case you encounter problems.\nHelp us test both game modes by grabbing a daily build and adding mm.dat to the same folder as your game files. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way.\nNow, go forth, and discover the true secrets of the game that started the long running epic fantasy series!\n>",

          "description": "As I write this many of the development team and other members of the community are busy having fun at a meet-up in Brussels. Not me though, I’m stuck here doing a release. We’ve been busy refactoring quite a lot of the underlying code to make future changes easier, but along the way we’ve found and fixed a few more bugs and quality of life improvements that we figured were worth releasing sooner than whenever 14.0 comes along. Notably, OpenTTD will now automatically disable hardware acceleration if it detects that the last crash happened while initialising the graphics driver. While hardware acceleration works well for the vast majority of people, it causes crashes for people that then required command line arguments or manual config file editing to get it to work. This should be a better solution for those users. Additionally, there is a change to the default mouse mode on Linux to improve experience when dragging the map (and often to match expected behaviour in other games). As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. While you’re at it, have you seen the post about the upcoming addition of a automated opt-in survey to OpenTTD 14? If you have opinions, we’d like to hear them! Details here. PS: we made a mistake in the Windows release; a 13.2.1 was pushed to address this issue. It is fully network compatible with 13.2, so no need to update unless you want to. Download Changelog Bug tracker",

          "description": "While working on an automated opt-in survey (about which I write in a bit), it was noticed that our privacy policy and cookie policy is rather out-of-date. Mostly, we used to store a lot more personal information when you created an account, like email addresses, passwords, etc. As we now use GitHub to handle all that, we can slim down our privacy policy, as we store very little personal information. For the cookie policy, for years now we only use cookies for the authenticated part of our websites and nothing else. OpenTTD’s privacy policy has always been: we want to know as little personal information about you as possible. And although these changes were rolled out years ago, the policies did not reflect that yet. They do now! In short: we removed statements from the policy about information we track, as we haven’t done that for years now. So, what about this automated opt-in survey you are talking about?",
