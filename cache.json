While the launch of a game with Mario in the title is a fairly regular occurrence, the release of the plumber's first all-new 2D platformer in over a decade is cause for special celebration. Super Mario Bros. Wonder brings back Mario and his Mushroom Kingdom brethren in a mainline series entry that we deem to be \"the slickest, sharpest, and smartest that two-dimensional Mario has felt since 1991\" in our review.\nAnd it's Super Mario Bros. Wonder, remember — Nintendo's most famous sibling is right there and playable from the start, as he should be. In honour of this evergreen fraternal relationship, today we're looking back at all the other sibling relationships and rivalries in the Nintendo canon.

          "description": "Ripe and ready.\nA couple of years ago, a Japanese company called Aladdin X released a digital projector, and it included a fun little fruit game called Suika Game as part of its software. Suika Game was so well received by people who bought the projector that the company decided to port a version of it to Switch, but the game launched there to almost no audience response. Then, two years later, it randomly became a viral sensation in Japan after a few streamers made it popular. Now it’s quietly made its way to the eShop outside of Japan, and while it’s admittedly very basic, it’s hard to say that Suika Game lacks appeal.\nSuika Game could best be described as “2048 with physics”. You drop fruit onto a board, with the goal of getting matching fruits to touch so they fuse into a bigger fruit, granting you extra points. The tough part comes in with the way that the fruits don’t neatly stack on each other. Each new fruit dropped in will roll around a bit and usually push others out of the way, often blocking access to fruits beneath it. Inevitably, this causes the board to fill up all the way and then you have to start all over.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It's so close to being a really good farming sim game, but doesn't quite manage to hit the mark. However, for the first time in the turbulent and confusing history of Natsume's Harvest Moon games, it's actually... fun.\nThe story is the same old, same old: the Harvest Goddess disappears after some catastrophic geographical event, and it's up to us to restore her and the world through the power of farming. The twist here is that a volcano erupted, and Ms. Goddess decided to build a bunch of walls around all the villages, thus both protecting them and isolating them in one fell swoop. You'll have to dismantle the walls, befriend the Sprites living inside them, and revitalise the towns within, mostly by completing various fetch quests. The story doesn't make a lot of sense — everyone is very chill about getting separated from their families for a decade — but it's good enough to get started with.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Games like Monark, Caligula Effect, and Crystar have all offered players some decent yet flawed experiences, and now the company has brought us yet another entry in this long line called Crymachina. Though it seems to take some cues from Crystar, Crymachina is a brand-new IP set in the far future that sees you fighting a seemingly endless horde of creepy robots with a bunch of depressed girls. It’s ridiculous, it’s fun, and it’s not great, but it may still be worth your time.\nThe narrative places you in the role of Leben, a girl who promptly dies of a mysterious illness in the first 10 seconds after cursing at the world and all the people who live in it. She is then resuscitated 2000 years in the future by a mysterious AI named Enoa, who has brought back a couple of other high school girls, too. Enoa explains that humans went extinct due to a world war over dwindling resources, but a team of scientists launched a spaceship called Eden just before the end in the hopes that one day humanity might rise again.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It was too frantic, too awkward, too short. Deadnaut Colon Signal Lost changes all those things and more. It's more like a re-interpretation of its own ideas than a direct sequel.

The composers, Lifeformed and Janice Kwan, said they'd received several false DMCA takedown notices for their work, which had resulted in the removal of both Tunic's soundtrack from numerous platforms, as well as three more of their albums. For a while, things looked very uncertain about the likelihood of their soundtracks returning. Left without much recourse against their distributor, the composers eventually filed a counterclaim to try and better protect their work and get them back online. Thankfully, they were successful, and all four soundtracks are back where they belong.  \nIt's been a messy saga about that's highlighted several issues about how DMCA claims can be manipulated like this, and they're not the only ones it's happened to recently, either. Fortunately for the Tunic duo at least, the situation's since been resolved and their soundtracks are now back where they belong - and to celebrate, they've released a whole new set of Tunic tracks that they describe as \"initial piano concepts\" for some of its major themes. And hey. You know me. I love a good piano collection of a video game soundtrack, so it is probably no surprise whatsoever that I've more or less had this on repeat for the last month.

I know Bit.Trip Runner and Choice Provisions’ assorted Bit.Trip rhythm games have been available on Steam for absolutely yonks (and still are, in fact), but my memories of these are all on the Nintendo Wii. That’s where I encountered most of the games first - and I haven’t really been back since. I dabbled in Runner 2 on the Wii U, but positively bounced off the 3D-ness of Runner 3 when it came to PC, preferring instead the clean, simple lines of its stark pixel sprites. \nIt's with some surprise, then, that I’ve had such a good time with Bit.Trip ReRunner, the recently released fancied up version of the auto-running original that brings its rhythmic courses kicking and screaming into that third dimension. But it’s really more of a compilation game than anything else, packing in extra protein in the form of EP soundtracks and freshly-created course selections from all eight games in the series (mashing tunes from Beat, Core, Void, Fate, Flux into a Runner-style format), as well as lots of new tricks and abilities up its sleeve. But the crown jewel in ReRunner isn’t so much the joy of getting a fresh dose of OG Runner again, but seeing what its player base has already started making with its brilliant Runner Maker level editor. Yep, much like Super Mario Maker before it, Bit.Trip has opened itself up to the whims of would-be game making audience, and they are running with it (sorry).\nRead more",

The latest Lords of the Fallen update, Patch v.1.1.207, is a thrilling litany of technical gremlins that have now been tracked down and slaughtered.\r\n\n\r\nAmongst other things, the developers have turned off collision detection for an entire library, to avoid tanking the frame-rate when you - for reasons best known only to yourself - attack the books. In other news, the game will no longer crash itself in \"revenge\" when you hit walls too often (a rare, and rather amusing-sounding bug - best be wary when looking for secret rooms I guess). Hexworks have also identified the source of a crashing problem when playing Lords of the Fallen on Steam Deck, though the fix for that particular issue hasn’t yet passed QA. Oh, and they've made the continue button \"sexier\". Look, don't ask me, I just work here.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The amount of comfort I got from playing Alpha Centauri throughout, though, was a surprise.\nIt's less about mere familiarity than you'd think, given how late I first played it. Sid Meier’s Alpha Centauri By Sid Meier endures partly because its design has aged well, but mostly because it's an unusually human 4X strategy. Its high concept story asks for interpretation, for a philosophical response. Where so many others are about the arbitrary icons of nationalism, or stock elves/insectoids/robots, it's a game about ideology and personality. Where a sequel to Civilization's \"send a colony ship into space\" ending could have asked \"what if lasers and aliens\", Alpha Centauri instead asked: Where is humanity going?\nRead more",

In They Are Billions, you scraped together walls and turrets to hold off a world's worth of undead, and prolong the miserable lives of a tiny handful of non-zombified humans at your settlement's core. Space Tales is breezier of demeanour - like the confusingly named 2014 RTS Space Rogue, it takes inspiration from 1940s retro-futurism, with brightly coloured maps and chunky chrome unit design. But there are similarly grim overtones. The game puts you in charge of a Starship Troopers-esque expeditionary force, carving out secure nooks on very-much-inhabited alien planets and flogging them as holiday destinations.\r\n\n \nRead more",

In Urbo there are no sky lasers, no oncoming hordes. Nothing. Just dinky little grid-based maps, and an endless stream of tiny adorable buildings to plonk down on them in the pursuit of sweet, sweet point scores.\nThis being a puzzle game, the aim here is to place three buildings of the same type altogether, either in a line or right-angled cluster, at which point they'll all shzooge together to level up to the next building type. This is where the Threes comparison comes in, though you can zhuzh more than three of the same building together if you're smart to earn more points. But it's not quite as simple as that. You see, your buildings will only shoump onto the tile you placed down last, and careful city planners will likely want to think about placing their buildings in reverse so they end up with their fancy new house in the place they actually want it, not in an awkward middle spot that cuts off two precious tiles from play, or awkwardly sits in the middle of another chain of dwellings accidentally. And yep, that's where the Dorfromantik connection comes in, and I really do like it very, very much.\nRead more",

The horror manga artist has an immediately recognisable style that intersects detailed, line heavy art with strange and upsetting concepts, and some of his short stories have acquired a sort of semi-memetic status (\"This is my hole! It was made for me!\"). If you're at all familiar with Junji Ito's work you will look at unforgiving almost-text-adventure World Of Horror and go \"Huh, that's inspired by Junji Ito.\"\nThis isn't just because it looks like his work but rendered in MSPaint, or because it contains, just, direct references to it, but because of the whole vibe. You encounter face-sloughing-off kinds of monsters and vengeful spirits inspired by Japanese folkloric yokai, but also weirdo janitors doing stuff like turning the swim team into mermaids in a kind of pervier version of Tusk. At the same time, there's a streak of the Lovecraftian in play to keep it nice and legally distinct, as each self-contained run at the titular world is an attempt to save your town from destruction at the hands of an Old God (they earn the leaden thud of the capital letters). You will fail a lot. But isn't failure part of the fun!? Imagine that enthusiastic question as a big spoonful of marmite popped into your mouth.\nRead more",

Created by Odd Meter, the studio behind the well-received fantasy VR bow simulator Sacralith: The Archer's Tale, and published by Frostpunk developer 11 bit Studios, it's a \"very serious adventure game\" set in 19th century Russia, which casts you as a young Orthodox Christian nun on the run. Awash with doubts about her faith, and persecuted by a mysterious creature, the woman flees her nunnery and falls in with an escaped convict, who tells her of a mysterious \"holy elder\" who might ease her troubles, drawing on the power of a sacred artefact.\nThe game's setting is naturalistic, with motion-captured facial animations and photorealistic buildings and interiors, wrought using Unreal Engine. But it is also a \"fairy tale\" landscape, in the words of studio co-founder Dmitry Setlov, shot through with phantasmagorical flourishes - monochrome or blood-red filters and apparent hallucinations, to say nothing of the aforesaid creature, a skulking mass of tendrils that puts me in mind of the Shadow from Ursula K Le Guin's novel A Wizard Of Earthsea.\nRead more",

On 19th August 1839, a young man opens his eyes to find himself in a vast, silent castle in the forests of Prussia. He discovers a letter from his \"past self\", Daniel, who urges him to murder the castle's secluded owner, a baron named Alexander, and warns that he is being hunted by a monstrous Shadow. 60 years later on New Year's Eve, the celebrated meat factory owner Oswald Mandus starts awake in the opulent stillness of his manor house in London. Hearing the distant voices of his children, he goes to look for them in the \"splendid architectures\" below.\nOn 21st July 1916, at the height of World War I, the soldier Henri Clément stumbles from his sickbed in a colossal bunker beneath the Western Front. With nobody about, and no memory of events during his convalescence, he follows a trail of blood through the collapsing tunnels towards the pantry. And on an unknown day in March 1939, the engineering drafter Tasi Trianon wakes in the wreckage of a plane, deep in the Algerian desert, and enters the nearby caves in search of her husband Salim. Four games, four forgotten pasts, four new beginnings, one descent.\nBeware: major spoilers for the entire Amnesia series below.\nRead more",

It's good, folks, and there's a lot to dig into with its release into early access this week. \nThere's a sizable story campaign and a bunch of side missions already playable here, and its emphasis on stealth and escalating security levels whisked me right back to the good old days of 2015 when I first sat down to play Klei's stealthy masterpiece. There are still a couple of rough edges here and there, but if you've been looking for a strategy RPG with a harder-edge than, say, Mimimi's recently released Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, or just something a bit sneakier than your run of XCOM-likes, Cyber Knights: Flashpoint is definitely worth keeping an augmented eye on.\nRead more",

I myself had to go lie down after seeing Phil in a Phantom Dust shirt. Teaser-shirts, we should have called them. Look at him in the picture up there, showing off a chestful of Hexen. Shameless!\r\n\n\r\nSadly/happily, those halcyon days are behind us, but Phil still loves to dangle the carrot of an ancient IP now and then.

Really, I think it comes down to developer Sledgehammer's decision to mash some of COD's previous triumphs with some of its finest maps.\nDespite COD extending its hand with a warm welcome back, I can't help but feel it's one trembled with nerves.

          "description": "The fleetingly Epic Games-owned online audio distribution company Bandcamp have shed \"at least\" half their staff in the course of being sold off to Songtradr as part of mass layoffs at Epic this summer. That's according to the union Bandcamp United, who are even now restarting discussions with Epic in the hope of obtaining a better outcome.\nIt's terrible news for those affected, of course, but it also doesn't bode well for the future of independent music. Bandcamp, which has now traded hands twice in two years, is one of the few places where indie musicians can make a living. There are plenty of angry reactions from musicians and bands on social media, as you'd expect, but game developers are also rallying in support of Bandcamp United, with criticism aimed at Epic and Songtradr in equal measure.\r\n\n \nRead more",

This is a thing Goldman I have in common. To help you tell us apart, a point of difference between Goldman and I is that he expressed his love of stupid courage by writing Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid, whereas I express mine by really liking Cyberpunk 2077.\r\n\nStupid courage is a trait that CD Projekt Red's first-person RPG seems to admire, but that's never more clear than in a new ending to the base game added by the Phantom Liberty expansion. It shows what happens when the heroes reject stupid courage and choose self-centred pragmatism instead. Spoilers for Cyberpunk 2077 and Phantom Liberty throughout.\n\n \nRead more",

One was a mind-bogglingly complex, almost military-grade-looking briefcase stuffed full of switches, nozzles and buttons, and the other was an impossibly cute cardboard flip book and projector combo that let its cartoon hero Bib bound across the 3D paper environments to find a way home.

Hermit And Pig is indeed a game about a reclusive old hermit and his truffle-hunting pig, but this charming adventure RPG also has one of the most involving turn-based battle systems I've come across in a while. \nTaking place in first person a la Dragon Quest, Hermit must deal with all sorts of mad and angry wildlife as he hunts for his favourite forest mushrooms, and their scowling (and endearingly daft) expressions are just the tip of this excellent iceberg. For you're not just choosing from a list of moves and watching them play out onscreen. Oh no. Each attack also comes with its own three-button fighting combo, and you'll need to input the right one (often at the right time) to deal the most damage. It's a brilliant system, making Hermit And Pig easily one of this year's highlights from EGX's Leftfield Collection. \nRead more",

          "description": "If you played a videogame at all in 2022, I hope it was Roadwarden. A blend of RPG and visual novel from Polish developer Moral Anxiety, it cast you as lonesome wayfarer maintaining the paths and investigating the mysteries or grievances of a thinly populated wilderness setting. It's a game of immense feeling, craft and cleverness, inspired by table-top games, which puts hoarier ideas about videogame role-playing through the wringer. In the world of Roadwarden, there's no grinding for XP or mindless loot-crafting treadmill. Knowledge, empathy and insight are worth far more than material wealth or wielding the shiniest axe. Quests can hinge on something as minute as your ear for dialects or knowing the correct form of address. And each village along the trail is a world in itself.\r\n\n\r\nMoral Anxiety's Windy Meadow - which actually dates back to before development of Roadwarden, but has been substantially remastered since the latter's release - essentially narrows the focus to one of those villages. Out today, it's a quietly gorgeous visual novel in which you follow several characters in different timeframes, building up a layered understanding of one and the same setting, with scene transitions plotted on a beautiful pixelart map screen.\n Read more",

As explained by Minecraft game director Agnes Larsson, the forthcoming Minecraft update – which has yet to be given a release date – is designed to “focus more on combat adventures and on tinkering” than last year's Cave & Cliffs update.\nThe headline addition is an underground structure called the Trial Chamber, a procedurally generated cluster of traps and treasure rooms, fashioned from copper and tuff blocks and arranged around a central hallway. From the Minecraft Live footage this weekend, Trial Chambers look like an evolution of the game's old buried fortresses, with some nifty new flourishes in the shape of copper bulb blocks that slowly give off less and less light, and new Trial Spawners, which generate a certain number of hostile mobs based on things like the number of players in your party.\r\n\n \nRead more",

A tasty one-more-go-er, perfectly suited to serving up in these dreary autumn months. There.

Built out of a game jam prototype from 2020, Leximan casts you (sorry) as a would-be wizard who's struggling to make an impact compared to his more verbally proficient schoolmates. In this particular demo, he's woken by a friend to go and assist the school cook with preparing breakfast, but things go horribly awry when a pesky fire elemental turns up to spoil it all.\nRead more",

Any point and click adventure game that makes a bid trying to be funny like the good old days has a very real chance of being painfully unfunny in my experience (looking at you, Deponia), and I was worried that Loco Motive would fall into the same try-hard pile as other so-called comedy adventures that have come out recently (see also Turnip Boy - yeah, I went there, fight me). But having played a timed 20-minute demo of it at this year's EGX, I'll hold my hands up and say, yep, I'm the one who's been slapped in the face with a giant custard pie here, as Loco Motive is genuinely really quite good, folks, and I'm pleased to report the good old days are still very much alive and kicking. Well, except poor old Lady Unterwald, who carks it within seconds of the game starting, and whose murder you end up getting framed for.\nRead more",

Whether it's in my own, real-life home or in a game, I am compelled to scrub, wipe and tidy - and the oily, purple globs of gunk clogging up Loddlenaut's appropriately named region of Flotsam Flats are just begging to be zapped by my little diver's handy laser gun. With just a single squeeze of the trigger, he sets to work, moving his arm automatically to neatly attack each neighbouring blob without any further prompting or manual aiming. All I need to focus on is getting him close enough to the gunge and he'll take care of the rest. Sure, it's perhaps not quite as involved as your PowerWash Sims and other polish em ups, but the combination of Loddlenaut's lo-fi visuals, comforting score and surprisingly soothing controller rumble all work to give it its own kind of zen-like charm - and it was enough to make me forget the surrounding din of the EGX Rezzed Zone for a very enjoyable 20 minutes or so.\nRead more",

He’s not alone on his journey either. As well as his mates from the first LAD, plus lots more newcomers, mainline Yakuza stablemate Kazuma Kiryu, now extra frosty with his silver hairdo, is also coming along for the ride as well. \nAlas, the circumstances in which the two join forces wasn’t covered in my 30-minute demo at this year’s EGX. Rather, we pick up Ichiban, Kiryu and fresh faces Chitose and Tomizawa as they land in Honolulu, in search of a dodgy cop named Roman who's managed to wrong almost everyone in the group at some point in the past. 30 minutes isn’t long in a game like Yakuza, but hey, I still got to screech at restaurant goers in one of its sidequest stories, as well as terrorise the general public on Ichiban’s always-deployable segway, which I’d still call a pretty strong introduction to this latest LAD.\nRead more",

Of course, it has the advantage of riding the coattails of already-established fiction and maybe that's cheating a little, but the result is a sort of grand 4X that in most regards I've enjoyed more the longer I played it.\nRead more",

The recipients include various Genshin Impact characters, represented by chibis. When you send some music to a character, you’re “rewarded” with an animated version of their chibi emote. \n\n\nThe problem is that some of these animated Genshin Impact chibis were very clearly made using some kind of AI tool.

Instead, all you need is a credit card!\n\n\nThat's right, instead of purchasing a quality game, you can spend just $25 to get enough Platinum for the cool mount. The Invincible Aspect bundle is available now for 2,500 Platinum through the Diablo 4 store. In case you were wondering, you can get 2,800 Platinum for $25. There's nothing in the store you can spend the leftover 300 Platinum on, but that's OK!

Now Nintendo of America president Doug Bowswer has commented on the possibility of a union at his company. \n\n\nIn an interview with Inverse, Bowser was asked what role unions might play at NOA in the future. Bowser touted NOA’s success without a union, pointing to its high employee retention rate. “Our focus has always been on creating a culture that's inclusive, has a work-life balance, and is focused on our singular mission of bringing smiles to faces,” Bowser said. \n\n\nAn inclusive culture creates a great foundation for employees at any workplace, but some still see unions as key to securing better pay, benefits, and treatment from a company. Bowser acknowledged that unions aren’t off the table at NOA. “Everyone has the right to form a union, and certainly in the future, wherever it takes us, we'll respect that,\" Bowser told Inverse.\n\n\nThe state of Nintendo\n\n\nIn April 2022 Kotaku published a report in which former contractors alleged that they were mistreated and never offered a legitimate path to full-time employment. “They want to control you like you’re full-time, but not treat you like a full-time worker,” one contract worker said. \n\n\nIGN published a similar report in May 2022. Some workers interviewed for the piece complained of “a huge disparity” between themselves and full-time employees. The company has previously faced labor complaints for allegedly cracking down on discussions of unionization.\n\nThe post Nintendo of America president comments on growing unionization efforts in the industry appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It's just a week away from Alan Wake 2's release, and we've finally gotten a look at the PC system requirements. It's a game that attempts to push graphical boundaries and competes with AAA titles from around the world, so it is no surprise that the requirements are quite steep. \n\n\n\n\nRegardless of your settings, you'll need 16GB RAM and Windows 10/11. Like a few other AAA games released this year, you also require an SSD with at least 90GB free. As for the CPU, Remedy is asking for a Ryzen 7 3700X or Intel equivalent for all settings except for the lowest where an Intel i5-7600K or AMD equivalent can be used. \n\n\nImage via Remedy.\n\n\nThe lowest settings will have you playing at 1080p at 30 FPS. To hit this, you'll need a GeForce RTX 2060 or a Radeon RX 6600. You'll also need 6GB VRAM. For a balanced experience that runs at 1440p at 30 FPS, ensure you have a GeForce RTX 3060 or a Radeon RX 6600 XT. The game also requires 8GB of VRAM. \n\n\nUltra settings are for enthusiasts because you'll need a monster of a machine to pull it off. With ultra settings, you can play at 4K at 60 FPS. You will also need 12GB VRAM and a GeForce RTX 4070 or a Radeon RX 7800 XT. \n\n\nThere are also settings for ray tracing included. Anyone hoping to get maximum ray tracing requires an RTX 4080 GPU. It's a big ask, but it may be worth it, as Control demonstrated Remedy's excellent use of ray tracing. \n\n\nThe next chapter in Alan Wake's story is almost upon us, but he won't be coming alone. This time around there's a second protagonist, Saga Anderson, who has a nose for sniffing out a mystery. \n\nThe post Alan Wake 2 PC system requirements revealed appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Do you remember how RoboCop: Rogue City was coming to Switch? No you don't, because it's not happening! Nacon has confirmed that their plans for a Switch version has been quietly tossed in the dumpster.\n\n\nThis might not be much of a surprise. The Switch logo hasn't been shown on the game's trailers since at least the Future Games Show that was held in August. It was, on the other hand, on its gameplay reveal trailer from last year. So, it seems that a Switch version was at least considered. Gematsu reached out to Nacon to get confirmation and was told, “At this moment, we don’t have any plans for a Nintendo Switch release.”\n\n\nNormally for a licensed game, this wouldn't be a huge loss, but I recently played the Robocop: Rogue City demo, and it instantly shot up my list of anticipated games. I was not expecting that. Not only does it capture the feel of being a walking refrigerator, it also ties in deeper elements to complement its gunplay. My only question at this point is if it can maintain that quality for the game's runtime. If so, I'll be stunned, blown away, and many other hyperbolic statements that will hopefully get me into the accolades trailer.\n\n\nAs I mentioned, however, a Switch version of Robocop: Rogue City was never heavily advertised to start with. However, there's evidence that it was considered, but they decided not to go through with it. This might have been technical difficulties, lack of budget, or any number of other reasons. Still, it's a bummer for gamers who prefer to stick to Nintendo's handheld hybrid.\n\n\nDid I mention how amped I am for this game?\n\n\nRoboCop: Rogue City is still coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on November 2, 2023. And I'm very excited.\n\nThe post Nacon quietly canceled the Switch version of RoboCop: Rogue City appeared first on Destructoid.",

The first Spider-Man game received a spin-off, Miles Morales, so it's natural to wonder whether the sequel will also feature a sequel, perhaps this time starring Venom. According to senior narrative director Jon Paquette, Insomniac is waiting to see how the fans react before they decide on the direction of a possible spinoff. \n\n\nAs Paquette explains, the main question Insomniac asks itself is \"what do the fans really want?\" Then, they try to give them that. After Spider-Man 2's successful launch, the studio does need some recovery time but discussing ideas will resume once everyone has \"had time to sleep and take vacations.\"\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\nVenom and his 19 inches\n\n\nIn Paquette's interview with Insider, he reveals that the aim was for the game to be \"one of the best Venom stories you've ever experienced.\" To do this, they would need an amazing voice actor, and it was found that Candyman's Tony Todd was the man for the job. When crafting the tale, Insomniac drew from the Spider-Man comics, but the studio still puts a unique twist on things. \n\n\nIt's not hard to imagine a Venom spin-off being celebrated, as it appears the character has already struck a chord with players. Part of his popularity comes from a viral PlayStation Tweet falling victim to bad phrasing when describing the Venom statue that comes with the Collector's Edition. \n\n\nIn Spider-Man 2, Venom's symbiote is discovered to help heal sickness and make its host feel stronger than ever. The longer it sticks around, however, the more it shows its sinister side, but by then it may be too late. \n\n\nVenom is a handful, but Peter doesn't have to face him alone. He receives help from Miles Morales, who you can also play as.\n\nThe post Spider-Man 2 director will ‘listen to the fans’ on possible Venom spin-off appeared first on Destructoid.",

I absolutely loved playing this one prior to release, and I’m so excited the rest of you can experience this wonderful side-scrolling platformer too. I had to make that pun somewhere. I’m not going to apologize for it.\n\n\nTo be clear, Super Mario Bros. Wonder isn’t a hard game. There are stages you can unlock here that will test your skill, but overall, this one’s 100% casual friendly. That said, as I was playing the game, I did come across a few quirks that I would have liked to know before I started playing. These are, ultimately, rather small things, but honestly, I’m just writing this as an excuse to chat more about this game with you all.

I knew it was going to be a rough road judging from the demo and every trailer shown for it. However, the roads are pretty beyond rough. They feel as though the roads, as well as the people on them, were created by someone who has never been in a vehicle before.\n\n\nAlaskan Road Truckers has a lot of problems, but the biggest one is that the central gameplay – the driving – sucks out loud. Part of this is the driving controls and vehicle physics in general, but the other part is the world around your truck.\n\n\nOne of the first things that struck me was a bump in the road.

This time, it's all about the spooky (I refuse to say \"spoops\" in earnest).\n\n\nIn a recent video uploaded to YouTube, Valve announced the Steam Scream: The Revenge fest begins on October 26, going on until November 2. Keep an eye on this page for details about what deals and discounts will be on offer.\n\n\n\n\nAs usual, we don't know the specifics of what games will be featured, but we do know it's a celebration of all things horror-related.\n\n\nFor example...\n\n\nIn the trailer above, you can see glimpses of some of the titles participating in Steam Scream. It looks like there's a healthy bunch of AAA and indie games to look forward to.\n\n\nWe can see clips from Black Mesa (the ambitious fan remake of Half-Life), Metro Exodus, Little Nightmares 2, DEVOUR, Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach, the Dead Space remake, GTFO, Hollow Knight, and more. In short, it looks like it's going to be a pretty interesting fest for us horror fans.\n\n\nThis time of year is always a hoot for the genre. Steam especially seems to keep its finger on the pulse when it comes to Halloween. As a long-time lover of horror gaming, the next week or so is going to be an exciting one for me.

In the vanilla experience, once a character ceases to be, they also cease to have any physical form, making it possible for others to just glide right through them.\n\n\nAre you tired of being able to walk through the dead bodies of Starfield like they aren't there? Wish it was possible for NPCs to step onto the corpses of those who lie in the way like human speed bumps? Well, wonder no more, as this modder has got you covered.\n\n\nImage via Korodic/Nexus Mods.\n\n\nWhy, I've had my immersion shattered watching the residents of Akila City not be able to nudge the corpse of someone I killed in cold blood. What kind of (fictional) world is this where NPCs can't even stand on the rotting cadavers that litter the streets?\n\n\nNot one I wish to live in, it seems\n\n\nThanks to Korodic's mod, you can now enjoy a more immersive experience in which dead bodies will now \"move when the player or an NPC walks into them or jumps on them.\" The report from DSO also says that this doesn't impact the game's performance, meaning that if you're playing the game on PC, you may as well install it.\n\n\nStarfield is a funny old thing. While it was the best-selling game for September in the US, it doesn't quite feel like it has the staying power of something like Skyrim. Its star has already dropped as people look forward to the next major release.\n\n\nI could be proven wrong, but without the modding community, it feels like Bethesda's newest IP won't have the legacy of some of the studio's previous work.

However, the offer won't be on forever, so you best pick up a copy before it's too late.\n\n\nAccording to the Epic Games website, you can get this Shinji Mikami title for exactly zero dollars until October 26. The deal only covers the base game, however. If you want the DLC as well, you'll have to fork over for them like some sort of pleb.\n\n\n\n\nThe Evil Within comes from the creator of the Resident Evil series. His resume features a host of other praised games, including Devil May Cry, Ghostwire: Tokyo, and, in a change from his usual horror outpourings, Hi-Fi Rush.\n\n\nOh, one more thing\n\n\nMaybe you've already played Evil Within, but haven't got around to playing the 2017 sequel. Fear not, for that's also going to be free through Epic Games as of next week. Pretty much as the deal for the original ends, the one for the follow-up begins. That's handy.\n\n\nWe're not far from Halloween now, so everything and anything related to horror is going to be coming out of the woodwork. This is probably not the best time of year for those who aren't into spooky games, but for those of us who are, it's like Christmas came early.\n\n\nOh, I almost forgot. To go alongside The Evil Within, you can also pick up a copy of Cosmonaut Studios' first-person story-driven puzzle game Eternal Threads.

          "description": "Steamforged Games is heading back to the world of Sony's Horizon series for Horizon Forbidden West: Seeds of Rebellion, and the Kickstarter campaign will go live on November 21.\n\n\nThe boardgame and miniature maker has made a name for itself over the years with tabletop adaptations of Dark Souls, Horizon Zero West, Monster Hunter, and Resident Evil, alongside a slew of original properties such as the hugely enjoyable competitive hex-based battler Godtear and dungeon-crawler Bardsung. \n\n\nDetails on Horizon Forbidden West: Seeds of Rebellion are reasonably thin on the ground, but Steamforged Games has said that this time out, it's a fully co-operative experience that can be played either solo or with up to four players. The story is also canon within the lore of Horizon, so fans of the series have that to look forward to. \n\n\nFor folks curious about how the story will be implemented in the game, Steamforged Games has the first entry in a diary series from lead designer Fraser McFetridge that runs through some details on how the narrative works.\n\n\nThe game will be set before Aloy's arrival in the Forbidden West, as rebellion and unease are growing amongst the Tenakth clans. It will be up to you and your fellow players to get to the bottom of the rebellion and stop it in its tracks before a tide of violence erupts across the land.\n\n\nBest of all, there will be a whole new range of miniatures included, and the range of Horizon Zero Dawn products that Steamforged Games already has available proves that Guerrilla Games' beautiful machine designs translate wonderfully into miniature form. \n\n\nAnybody interested in watching the campaign or picking up the game can head on over to the official Kickstarter page and hit \"Notify me on launch,\" as long as you have a Kickstarter account already.\n\nThe post Steamforged Games’ Horizon Forbidden West: Seeds of Rebellion Kickstarter goes live on November 21 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Insomniac's Spider-Man 2 launched on PS5 this week, starting a new chapter in one of PlayStation's flagship series. The importance of the game for the console cannot be understated, as it is one of the biggest current-gen PlayStation exclusives to date. A recent Bloomberg report suggests that Peter and Miles' latest adventure could be the key to the kind of PS5 sales growth Sony is looking for. \n\n\n As the report highlights, though the PS5 has been a popular console, it has faced a few circumstances that have limited how many units could be sold. One of the biggest hurdles was the COVID-19 pandemic which constrained the company's ability to meet demand. Consequently, the PS5 has sold 40 million units since launch in 2020. This is a good number, but the PS4 managed to do it in about two and a half years. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\nHigh hopes for Spider-Man 2\n\n\nSony is hoping to sell 25 million PS5s this fiscal year. Supply chain issues have been resolved, and the company has also revealed smaller models set to release this holiday, which should help boost sales as well. \n\n\nThere is reason to believe that Spider-Man 2 could help Sony achieve its ambitious goals. The first game from Insomniac, as well as Miles Morales, together sold 33 million copies. Its proven track record for drawing in fans makes Spider-Man one of the PS5's key franchises. \n\n\nResearch director Lewis Ward predicts that the game \"will eventually sell tens of millions of copies.\" This isn't hard to believe, as Spider-Man 2 has been receiving excellent critical acclaim. It's a fun game with plenty of action, humor, and Easter eggs for long-time fans of New York's favorite web-slinging crime fighter.\n\nThe post Spider-Man 2 could help Sony boost PS5 sales appeared first on Destructoid.",

From October 19 until October 22, all Xbox members, even those without Game Pass, have access to a 10-hour gameplay trial.

Season 2 of Diablo 4 is a lot of fun and is a great opportunity for prospective players to have a fun Action RPG experience over the weekend. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like a similar option is available for PC or PlayStation.\n\n\n\n\nFor those with Xbox Game Pass Core or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, you'll also have access to NBA 2K24, Lawn Mowing Simulator, and Hokko Life during this Free Play Days event. As always, your progress across all of these titles, including the Diablo 4 trial, is saved. So, if you do end up deciding to purchase the game after the event, or even at a later date, you will be able to pick up where you left off.\n\n\nAlongside the 10-hour trial, Diablo 4 is also on sale for 25% through November 1.

The new narrative-focused expansion will allow players to wield reality-breaking technologies to explore alternate dimensions. In these parallel universes, players will encounter new creatures and phenomena as they journey into the true unknown. There was no specific release date given for Astral Planes, but the release does say it is coming to PC later this year.\n\n\n\n\nThe story-centric expansion will feature branching narratives, a first for Stellaris. Players can navigate a branching narrative built specifically to make choices matter. According to Paradox, Astral Planes will be full of surprises and hard choices. Decisions will not only affect the narrative but also shape the player's empire to fit their playstyle.\n\n\nIn terms of gameplay features, Astral Planes will feature new Technologies, Actions, and Relics, which is pretty par for the course for this type of expansion. It also appears there is a new Origin called Riftworld. \n\n\nStellaris is my favorite Grand Strategy game, so any new content looks good to me.

It uses somewhat lo-fi graphics, and all the press material I have just says it’s about angrily killing foes. The foes consist of CRT-headed dudes and other assorted weirdos. Don’t worry about creating CRT-headed orphans, however, because apparently, you’re fighting “through the depths of the human mind.” The very angry depths.\n\n\n\n\nTo be fair, though, the short, 22-second trailer says a lot. Beyond the trippy visuals, first-person melee is a carrot that few have even touched. 2005’s Condemned: Criminal Origins is often cited as one of the few games to even come close to making it work. I’m currently straining to think of another game that did it well following that. Doom (2016)’s glory kills come to mind, but it’s just hitting a button and watching Doomguy be all vicious. That really doesn’t count.\n\n\nSo, yeah, that’s all I got, aside from the fact that it calls itself “Murder-punk.” We’ll have to wait and see if Hellpunk manages to achieve what has been lost.\n\n\nHellpunk is coming to PC via Steam.

System Shock 2: Enhanced Edition has been in the pipeline for a while, however, with it being promised to anyone who pre-ordered the System Shock remaster.\n\n\n\n\nThe Enhanced Edition comes with the added benefit of higher resolution, widescreen, and post-processing effects. The graphics have also been touched up, but in typical Nightdive fashion, they’re carefully tweaked to improve the look without altering the gameplay. It will also be available on consoles for the first time.\n\n\nSystem Shock 2 was the first game from Irrational Games and was a sequel to Looking Glass Studios’ 1994 title, System Shock. The title is held in high regard, and its design would influence its spiritual successor, 2007’s Bioshock. I’m sure some fans will be disappointed that Nightdive didn’t completely overhaul the 1999 title in the same way they did the original System Shock, but of the two titles, the latter definitely needed a lick of paint.\n\n\nThere’s still no release date for System Shock 2: Enhanced Edition aside from “coming soon” and “in the near future.” It will be coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.\n\nThe post Nightdive shows off System Shock 2: Enhanced Edition at Indie Horror Showcase appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Super Mario Bros. Wonder is finally here, and you can celebrate in physical merch form with this new My Nintendo reward. Nintendo now has a listing for the \"Super Mario Bros. Wonder Double Keychain,\" which features Mario in his normal and elephant forms (hence the \"double\"). It's a little strange having Mario and his presumed doppelganger on there instead of another character, but what are you gonna do: he sells merch!\n\n\nMario rewards typically go fast, but at 800 Platinum Points, you'll want to sit and think on this one for a while. Here's a bit more info on the 5\"x 6\" reward to help you decide: \"It also comes with a colorful strap that shows off the new Elephant Fruit, Drill Mushroom, Wonder Flower and Wonder Seed.\"\n\n\nWhat other recent My Nintendo rewards are there?\n\n\nIf you have the sinking feeling that there was a recently announced but yet-to-be-released My Nintendo reward: there is! It's none other than the Detective Pikachu coffee cozy, representing a game that kind of came and went from our collective consciousness. We'll update you when it launches!\n\n\nAs a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked\n\nThe post Mario Wonder’s physical My Nintendo reward is a double keychain appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Netmarble, the South Korean company behind Seven Deadly Sins: Grand Cross and Ni no Kuni: Cross Worlds has announced a new update for Tower of God: New World, including new characters, story content, and more. The update also includes various limited time events lasting until November 1.\n\n\n\n\nUrek Mazino (SSR+ [Flight]) and Endorsi (SSR [Child]) join the game in this Halloween update. In fact, the new story content, dubbed “Endorsi and the October Illusion,” is an original event dealing with Endorsi being bullied by her sisters. There’s also an event mission and illusion event exchange shop for October, where players can earn a new outfit for SSR Xia Xia. \n\n\nIn addition, alternative costumes for Yuri, Rachel, and Lozeal are also available.\n\n\nIt’d seem the only event that’s not set to expire at the end of the month is a welcome back boost where players can earn a variety of rewards simply by playing the game and completing missions every day for seven days in a row. This event is currently ongoing with no projected end date.\n\n\nTower of God: New World released for Android and iOS devices (with a PC version available via Google Play Games Beta) this July. The mobile game follows the story of the acclaimed webtoon and anime adaptation, the latter of which premiered in 2020, as part of the Crunchyroll Originals branding.

          "description": "Marvel's Spider-Man didn't include the option to replay the story in New Game Plus mode when it first launched in 2018. But Insomniac wasn't lazing about in a hammock made of webbing, either. The developer launched the feature roughly six weeks after launch. Is it coming to the sequel? Oh yes, and now we (roughly) know when: before the end of this year.\n\n\nNew Game Plus (NG+) won't be alone on missing release, as Spider-Man 2 is also getting updated with a mission replay feature too. This update flew a bit under our radar, but like any wily city pigeon, we eventually caught it. Within the replies to Insomniac's announcement of a game up on Twitter/X, the company's community director was hashing out what's coming to Spider-Man 2 post-launch. The director in question, James Stevenson, mentioned New Game Plus mode will release for Spider-Man 2 \"before [the] end of [the] year.\" \n\n\n\n\n\nWill New Game Plus and mission replay release for Spider-Man 2 at the same time?\n\n\nThe bonus to the news is that the NG+ mode isn't coming to the game alone. Spider-Man 2 will get a mission replay feature, according to Stevenson. It's not confirmed that it'll arrive alongside New Game Plus, however. In a reply, Stevenson wrote that the team is \"working on an update for those features,\" including NG+, \"but they won't be in Day 1.\" He later clarifies when NG+ is expected to drop, but isn't specific about mission replay.\n\n\n\n\n\nEither way, it should be exciting for Spider-Man 2 fans who dream of knocking out early-game bosses while fully kitted out. The NG+ update for the original game included two more trophies: 'One More Time' got awarded for playing the game again in NG+, and 'Power and Responsibility' was earned after beating the game in Ultimate difficulty. And yes, you could acquire the latter trophy in NG+.\n\n\nMarvel's Spider-Man 2 launches on PlayStation 5 on October 20.\n\nThe post Spider-Man 2 will get New Game Plus before the end of the year appeared first on Destructoid.",

Similar to how Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios handles its primary Kamurocho open world in the Like a Dragon (formerly Yakuza) series, Insomniac opted for an iteration over reinvention approach for its New York City – with some big changes.

As previously announced, all Brutal Edition owners of Ghostrunner 2 will get the Season Pass, which includes all of the DLC announced today. Otherwise, the Season Pass will cost $19.99.\nAs for what to expect, One More Level has revealed four cosmetic packs and a new way to play the game called Endless Moto Mode. Given that we know Ghostrunner 2 features a motorbike for protagonist Jack to ride, we're guessing this new mode has something to do with that. In each cosmetic pack, players will receive three sword skins, three hand skins, and one motorcycle skin. The first one – Ice Pack – goes live in-game on December 7. \nCheck out the Ghostrunner 2 Season Pass trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nSometime in February, the Dragon Pack will go live followed by the Heat Pack in June of next year. The Endless Moto Mode is due out sometime in September of 2024, with the Anniversary Pack following it in October. \nBuying the Brutal Edition of Ghostrunner 2 gets you all of this DLC and 48-hours of early access to the game, meaning you can jump in starting October 24 ahead of the game's standard October 26 release date. \nFor more, check out the Ghostrunner 2 soundtrack list (and listen to a full song from it right now), and then watch this gameplay trailer from earlier this year.\nAre you jumping into Ghostrunner 2 next week?

Paradox Rift features new Ancient and Future Pokémon, playing off a story element of the Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet games, as well as type-shifted Tera Pokémon EX cards to play off one of the core mechanics of the latest-generation video games. \nSpeaking of Pokémon EX cards, Paradox Rift offers more than 15 new Pokémon EX cards, but it doesn't stop there. Collectors and players alike can also expect more than 20 new Trainer cards, as well as 15 special illustration rare Pokémon and Supporter cards and 28 ultra rare full-art etched Pokémon EX and Supporter cards. There are even seven hyper-rare gold-etched cards to cross your fingers for.\nThe Pokémon Company sent along a bunch of booster packs from the Paradox Rift expansion for us to open in order to see what we could pull. After the last expansion focused squarely on the original 151 Pokémon, Paradox Rift largely shines the spotlight elsewhere (though a few Kanto creatures still show up). I loved the Yveltal and Garchomp EX cards I pulled, but my favorite is probably the Armarouge EX. I also loved the Ancient and Future Pokémon, but I'm disappointed the ones I pulled weren't foils. However, the gold-etched Iron Valiant EX card more than made up for that.\nCheck out my favorite pulls in the gallery below:\n\nPokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet – Paradox Rift arrives on store shelves on November 3.

But it may leave you wondering – who is being teased?\nSPOILERS AHEAD FOR THE END OF MARVEL’S SPIDER-MAN 2.\nWith Peter and Miles’ big team-up adventure now complete, developer Insomniac Games seems ready to suggest a new spider-powered hero, introducing this universe’s version of Cindy Moon, aka Silk.\nSilk is a more recent addition to the Marvel canon, first appearing in the 2014 relaunch of The Amazing Spider-Man series. The character, created by Dan Slott and Humberto Ramos, is one of several heroic leads that have expanded the scope of the Spider-Man universe.\nIn her origi…",

It functions both as a great parody of anime characters who are constantly struggling to become stronger and as great action anime on its own. As a video game, however, it struggles somewhat as Saitama must defeat everyone in one punch, which isn't particularly fun gameplay, forcing you to play as the many other characters of the franchise, who sadly aren't Saitama.\nOne Punch Man: World is currently in closed beta and while it doesn't particularly solve any of those issues, it does look great and showcase some impressive action. It is a free-to-play game, though, which means there are gacha mechanics and lots of different currencies to deal with. Join Marcus Stewart and me as we check out the game and share our thoughts on the One Punch Man anime.\n\n\nHead over to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

Stevenson said, \"No, we're working on an update for those features but they won't be in Day 1.\"\nNo - we’re working on an update for those features but they won’t be in Day 1\nOctober 17, 2023\nAfter someone on Twitter expressed their disappointment in the replies, Stevenson clarified that New Game Plus was not a Day 1 feature in the original Marvel's Spider-Man, but instead a mode added roughly six weeks after launch. \nSomeone else asked Stevenson on Twitter if New Game Plus is coming this year or 2024 and Stevenson said it \"should be before end of year.\"\nShould be before end of year\nOctober 18, 2023\nSo if you're looking forward to replaying the story of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 with all of your favorite suits, gadgets, abilities, and more unlocked from the jump, it sounds like it could be just a month or two away. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 review and then read about the Marvel's Spider-Man 2 Day 1 patch.

It was an early instance of a fully modeled 3D location, and its use of FMV actors for its cast felt like you were looking into the future of video games. It received a few underwhelming sequels and other adaptions, but The 7th Guest VR marks arguably its biggest and boldest reimagining. Effectively a remake, this version of the game takes the familiar locations and story and adds in new puzzles and new performances. Considering the original game (and this remake) is about exploring a spooky house and solving puzzles, it feels at home in VR. You can watch Wes LeBlanc and me check out the game below.\nFor a whole lot more on The 7th Guest, you can read our oral history of the game right here. You can also take a look at this translated interview between Mario and Zelda creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, and Spirited Away director, Hayao Miyazaki, from the early 90s where Miyamoto called the game \"inspiring\".\n\n\nHead over to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

That wasn't all, though; The snippets of composer David Housden's score in the reveal trailer indicated this team was on to something. \nIt was clear from the first listen that Housden and Dlala put a lot of effort into making Illusion Island sound like Disney.

And after just six weeks on the market, Starfield is already the seventh best-selling game of the year. February's Hogwarts Legacy remains in the top spot. \nStarfield hit Xbox and PC on September 6 and while its Xbox Game Pass release surely helped it become the biggest launch ever for a Bethesda game with more than 6 million players, Circana's data tracks dollar sales. This means Starfield was the best-selling game of September despite Xbox Game Pass. Circana executive director Mat Piscatella says on Twitter that, \"Starfield ranked as the best-s…",

Insomniac is too, but in a new statement, it tells players that while the game will be playable on physical discs in full, it recommends downloading the day one patch. \nMore specifically, the download update is Version 1.001.002 and it will be available at launch this Friday.

Digital players – don't worry, if you pre-load the digital version of the game, you'll get 1.001.002 as your pre-loaded version.\" \nAs for why, Insomniac says this update features polish to the gold master of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 available on disc. It improves the opening sections of the game and includes other general refinements to the Spidey experience. It also includes some additional accessibility options. \nMarvel's Spider-Man 2 hits PlayStation 5 on October 20. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 review and then watch this Marvel's Spider-Man 2 cinematic trailer.

Now, Analogue is targeting the Nintendo 64 catalog with its next device, the Analogue 3D. \nAnalogue has shared an image of what appears to be the device, although the full look at it is obscured. You can view it at the top of the article, but it's below as well:\nAn image released alongside today's news teases what appears to be a sleek, black, and faithful recreation of the Nintendo 64 controller. You can check it out below: \nAnalogue says the 3D device will feature 4K HDMI output, its proprietary Analogue OS, wireless Bluetooth, and 2.4G Wi-Fi. It will also have \"4 original-style controller ports,\" presumably so that players can use their original Nintendo 64 controllers with the 3D. The company says the 3D's 4K output allowed \"us to created incomprehensibly profound Original Display Modes,\" and that in collaboration with 8BitDo, it will release a wireless controller for the device. \nAnalogue didn't share more, but the 3D is set to release some time in 2024.

Join us as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign.  \nAfter 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.\nJoin editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up. \nPart 1 - Surpr-iced! \nPart 2 - Bringing The Smoke\nPart 3 - Staff Meeting\nPart 4 - My Life As A Lin Kuei Robot\nFinale - Waking the Dragons\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

Unfortunately, co-op is restricted to local play. Living alone and working remotely makes couch co-op a tricky proposition, and the only way for me to test this is by using the PS5’s Share Play feature with another editor, but that feature won’t work until the game launches next Tuesday.

          "description": "Dead Island 2 is getting its first story expansion dubbed Haus. The adventure whisks players to new locations to take on a mysterious cult while surviving that pesky zombie apocalypse. \nThis new storyline centers on techno-death cults hosted by its crazed leader, Konstantin, who believes such battles are the \"paragon of the future.\" The adventure unfolds in a Malibu villa, described in a press release as a \"deranged labyrinth of biomes where rational architecture is subverted by expanding narrative spaces.\"\n\n\nYour guess is as good as ours as to what that means, but Haus features eight new cards and new weapons, such as the long-ranged K-Rossbow and the flame-spewing Hog Roaster. Developer Dambuster Studios has not posted a trailer but did release a few screenshots that you can view below.\n\nDead Island 2 Haus launches on November 2. You can read our review of the base game here, and be sure to check out our deep-dive feature on the development of Yager Interactive's scrapped version of Dead Island 2.",
