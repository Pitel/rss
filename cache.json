It's slow, it's clunky and it's flooded with games that we'd really rather not have to wade through, but what's it like from the other side? How does the storefront hold up if you're the one trying to sell games on it?\nThat was a question recently asked by IGN in a new feature that put Nintendo's storefront (and Sony's, Microsoft's and Valve's) under the microscope. Unsurprisingly, the devs are just as tired of it as we all are.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "But wait, there's more!\n44 years after its release, you'd think that the speedrunning community would have pushed the Donkey Kong arcade game to its limit. But, as it turns out, there are a handful of extra levels hidden behind the game's long-assumed unbeatable kill screen. All you've got to do is beat it.\nThat's the challenge that was recently undertaken by Super Mario Bros. speedrunner Kosmic. In a 29-minute YouTube video, the Mario pro explains that Donkey Kong's US arcade release (the one used for competitive play) maxes out at the first barrel stage of level 22. This comes as a product of a glitch in the game's bonus timer algorithm, where the game will prematurely end after just 400 bonus points have passed — nowhere near long enough to make it all the way to Pauline at the top of the tower.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Two separate campaigns take place in an imposing 1800s Pyrenees monastery, which doubles as an insane asylum. This mountaintop prison offers no redemption, nor escape from earthly woes, for five luckless inmates aiming to escape, or destroy, their captors.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Well, it’s all about the traversal: Laika expertly blends motocross gameplay with more traditional Metroidvania mechanics, doing away with segmented rooms and corridors in favour of sprawling, interconnected landscapes. You’re specifically encouraged to travel at high speeds, launch yourself into the air, and pull off badass flips that will have Trials fans giddy.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

She greets him like a nobleman. I have Henry push back. He's a blacksmith's son. He might have some blue blood care of his biological father, but he grew up in the soot and clamour of the forge. The girl nervously insists, however: Henry must be from the upper crust, or he wouldn't have been welcomed and feasted by the lord of the estate. He wouldn't be lying in his very own chamber with its very own hole for shitting in - and in any case, it's more than her job's worth to treat him otherwise.

Resident Evil 4, Fallout 3, Gears Of War - all bleary examples of a grubby visual style. This peaked in Clive Barker's Jericho, a shooter so desaturated it felt like the colour settings on your monitor were banjaxed. I have heard this called \"the piss filter\" and generally lamented in industry circles. But it was always a puposeful choice, intended to add some grittiness to the world. And there's at least one developer who is reviving \"smeared dirt\" as an art direction. As Time Surrenders is a very brown stealth game that takes a lot of inspiration from Metal Gear Solid V.\nRead more",

It’s a mostly AI-powered technology at a time when mistrust in artificial intelligence, fuelled by underbaked applications and anti-creative policies, is at all-time high – not to mention how the new GeForce GPUs it’s released alongside, the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090, have immediately entered 2020-style stock shortage purgatory.\nHowever, having tried it out in a few different games, I suspect time will prove kinder to DLSS 4 than the RTX 50 series launch has been. It is, in fact, a rather nifty collection of upscaling improvements that can help out older graphics cards as readily as the very newest, while building on DLSS 3’s frame generation tool with Multi Frame Generation (MFG) to send visual smoothness skyrocketing. If you care even the slightest iota for how your PC performs in modern games, DLSS 4 demands your attention.\nHere, then, I’ll break down DLSS 4’s various tricks and components, looking at how they really affect performance – and whether it’s worth upgrading your rig to maximise compatibility with it.\nRead more",

Well, part of a poem. Both to free up room on the disc and perhaps, to edit out \"the vast sorrows and all the vexations\" of the second half, only the first two stanzas appear. The recording in fact ends halfway through a line, which conjures up an intriguing problem for the listener, inasmuch as the thwarted rhyme scheme reveals that the piece is incomplete. A poetically-minded alien might be tempted to fill in the gap. A fancier alien who took a module in postmodernism might hail the poetics of the fragment. A resolutely practical alien who thinks poetry is for losers might read the whole thing, instead, as a set of incoherent navigational prompts, made up of loose prepositions - au-dessus, au-dessus, par delà, par delà.\r\n \nRead more",

Happily, all these ray tracing and frame generation accoutrements seemingly won’t preclude Spidey 2 from working on older, slower PCs as well, as the minimum specs are surprisingly reasonable.\nGranted, they’re only rated for 30fps at a lowly 720p, and you’ll still need to find a honking 140GB of SSD space, but the basic GPU and CPU requirements aren’t too lofty at all. The likes of an RTX 3060 for 60fps/1080p are quite reasonable as well, though you’re staring down the barrel of Nvidia’s pricey RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 cards for high-rez ray tracing.\nRead more",

          "description": "Looks like they finally got the message. \"An account for PlayStation Network will become optional for these titles on PC,\" said PlayStation in a short and quiet blog post that includes the upcoming PC release for Spider-Man 2, and The Last Of Us Part II. It's been eight months since PlayStation provoked mass annoyance among PC players by making a PSN account mandatory to play Helldivers 2, and later Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered. They soon walked back the decision for Helldivers 2 after a rough review-bombing but the company didn't seem to fully take the hint. It looks like they've now conceded that, yes, the obligatory sign-up was an unpopular move.\nRead more",

Among Phantom Line's headline features is the HUSK system, which lets you switch between members of your squad right in the middle of combat. Unless, presumably, the body in question is already occupied by one of your co-op partners.

The RTX 3080 was a thing of beauty, only to be tarnished by the worst wheeler-dealing spree (and crypto mining misappropriation) in PC component history. Then the RTX 4080 rocked up with its laughable £1269 / $1199 price tag, a miscalculation so severe that the RTX 4080 Super looked good – despite hardly being any faster – simply for not repeating it. For the new RTX 5080’s sake, you almost want it to be boring.\nIt isn’t. But then, neither is it a blood-boiler like the RTX 4080, nor a largely aspirational show-off piece like the RTX 5090. By maintaining the 4080 Super’s course correction on price while tooling up on compelling DLSS 4 improvements, the RTX 5080 is an agreeable GPU from the off. Particularly, if you’ve got the 4K monitor to take full advantage of it.\nRead more",

In fairness to Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, which Nic says can be great as a game per se, it does make some effort at settling into Windows. It has rebindable M+K controls. It has DLSS. It has generally more consistent framerates than FFXVI, which could bait you in with silky visuals before grabbing your head and shoving it into the cold ice bath of sub-30fps.\nYet it also steps back from that game on its supported tech, while raising its hardware requirements so far above Final Fantasy 7 Remake that it won’t even launch on a lot of older graphics cards.

Have Ubi delivered? I think there's a strong chance.

Dick’s cheese dreams. At least two of those points will, I’m sure, send the average graphics card shopper running, especially at a time when even game developers are growing suspicious of generative AI and its many-thumbed, robot-voiced nostrums.\nYet while there’s not much to be done about the RTX 5090 costing at minimum £1939 / $1999, hundreds more than the infamously spenny RTX 4090, its suite of more purely performance-focused artificial intelligence tools is – dare I say it – quite neat. These range from Multi Frame Generation (MFG), which is basically DLSS 3 frame gen but up to twice as fast, to DLSS 4’s general upscaling enhancements and even the ability to apply newer DLSS versions to older games. All this will come to the rest of the RTX 50 series as well, with some trickling down to the enter RTX range, so maybe the RTX 5090 is best understood not as a practical GPU purchase in itself but as a Picadilly Square-filling advert for its more affordable siblings can do.\nRead more",

I haven't taken a shower in days and a fly has gotten into the cab, buzzing around my ears, anticipating the feast that will come from my sweaty summer death. I just spent nearly an hour driving this tractor to the shop, buying car parts, and rumbling back in the dark. I took my eyes off the road for two seconds to turn on the headlights. It was a mistake. The road curved sharply and I went off a steep bank, tipping my tractor on its side. The door is stuck, the tractor's wheels spin helplessly. There is no recovering from this. I restart the game for the third or fourth time, not knowing whether to laugh or sob.\nMy Summer Car is as hardcore as they come. It does not simply throw you in at the deep end. It ties you up in a cloth sack with 50 kg of lug nuts and dumps you in the Baltic sea. \"Sink or swim!\" yells this game at you, but in Finnish, so even that you cannot understand.

Eliot's The Love Song Of J. Alfred Prufrock. The poem meant enough to me that I didn't want to dissect it with a class. I wanted to keep for myself. I went in the end, and though I hesitated, I talked because I had things to say. It didn't kill the poem for me, but it does have a slightly awkward gait now, having never quite recovered from the incisions.\nI now have to etherise Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth. Cait Sith is splayed upon a table. It's all scalpels, forceps, and oversized novelty dice. It's a strange way to treat art you love. The feeling I remember most from Rebirth on release is how grateful I felt to be alive to play it. Acute, active awareness of my own mortality with thoughts like \"it would be properly shit if I died right now because I'd really like to see how this pans out\". A personal 'never kill yourself' moment months before the meme gave voice, as the best often do, to an obscure and precious feeling.\nAn RPG where your character sometimes knocks on doors before opening them?

This time, the culprit is Matthew Ball of analyst firm Epyllion, who remarks in a sprawling State Of Videogaming 2025 report that \"some gamemakers hope GTA 6 will be priced at $80-$100 [in the USA], breaking the $70 barrier and helping $50 titles to move up to $60, $60 to $70, $70 to $80, etc.\"\nPicked up by VGC, these comments have now been circulated on social media, and have attracted the extremely polarised mixture of responses you're probably expecting. Among those chipping in is Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse, who makes the familiar argument that overall prices for games like GTA aren't necessarily higher today when you factor in economic inflation, while also acknowledging that up-front price alone doesn't explain the industry's recent mass livelihood devastation, and that few people would happily pay that much for a video game - not even Our Lord In Open Worlding GTA.\n Read more",

          "description": "Capcom have declared that they hope to bring down the recommended PC specs for open world dinosaur-tipping simulator Monster Hunter Wilds, just a month before release day on 28th February, and a few weeks ahead of the final open beta. Much like an exhausted hunter applying a carving knife to the flanks of a steaming heap of Rathalos, they shall trim and whittle their prize to its essential organs - hmm, actually we never see the concluding butchery in Monster Hunter games, now that I think of it. You just waft your knife around dramatically while the slaughtered quarry peacefully disappears and chunks of dino component materialise in your inventory.\n  \nRead more",

I think your character is supposed to kindle them automatically when you venture into a dungeon - at which point the view switches, classic Ultima-style, from top-down into first-person. My character never deigns to light a torch, however. Possibly this is because, no matter how many torches I loot or buy from the underworld's infrequent traders, my character page always tells me I have none. Is my character eating them? Are they too afraid to light them and expose what those dungeons contain? Do I need to read the manual properly? Or is it just a bug?\r\n \nRead more",

Na konci loňského roku evidovalo sdružení CZ.NIC 1 485 493 domén s koncovkou .CZ, přičemž nejvíce domén bylo v roce 2024 zaregistrováno v listopadu (22 311) a nejméně tradičně v létě (srpen, 13 460). V průměru bylo vloni měsíčně zaevidováno 16 374 domén s koncovkou .CZ. I tentokrát Domain Report obsahuje kapitoly Webový obsah, Doménový zeměpis nebo statistiky týkající se DNS provozu či zavádění technologie DNSSEC. Jednou z novinek letošního reportu je část věnovaná službě Aukce domén, kterou sdružení CZ.NIC spustilo v květnu loňského roku. Tato služba se týká domén s koncovkou .CZ, které nebyly prodlouženy a mohly by se tak vrátit do doménového prostoru.",

That was interesting for showing the benefits of Zen 5's full 512-bit data path support compared to the \"double pumped\" approach with Zen 4 or optionally used via a BIOS option on Zen 5. AVX-512 continues to prove to be very performant and power efficient with AMD Zen 5 processors unlike with the early generations of AVX-512 on Intel processors.

You'll only need two ingredients to create this dish, thankfully. \n\n\nSeafood Salad Disney Dreamlight Valley ingredients\n\n\nTo create the two-star meal Seafood Salad, you'll need two ingredients. They include:\n\n\n\nAny Seafood (Squid, Lobster, etc)\n\n\nLettuce\n\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nLettuce is easy to find. You can buy the seeds for 3 Star Coins from Goofy's Stall in the Peaceful Meadow. You may also be lucky and be able to purchase the actual ingredient itself. Thankfully, the seeds don't take long to grow after being planted and watered. The growing process takes just three minutes.\n\n\nYou can use any seafood for this dish. One important thing to note, however, is that fish don't count towards the Seafood Salad. You'll need to catch lobsters, squid, basically anything without fins. Clams, Oysters, and Scallops are the easiest to find as they can be picked up from the sand at Dazzle Beach.\n\n\nIf you want the dish to be more valuable, however, you may want to find Lobsters instead. You can find the crustacean in the Glade of Trust within orange ripples. Use your fishing rod and try to catch the lobster. \n\n\nBy the way, you should hang out with a valley friend who has the fishing specialty on them. Not only will their friendship level progress, but they have a chance to double your catch, so you can get two lobsters with one cast.\n\n\nCreate the dish\n\n\nHead to any cooking station within Chez Remy or your house and chuck both ingredients in the pot. You'll then have the Seafood Salad ready to eat. If you have Lobster in your dish, you can sell it at Goofy's Stall for 1,245 Star Coins or eat it for 2,865 Energy.\n\n\nHave spare lobsters in your bag? You can make an awesome Lobster Roll. It probably won't beat the one I had in Boston though!\n\nThe post How to make Seafood Salad in Disney Dreamlight Valley appeared first on Destructoid.",

This three-star dish can be created from ingredients you can find in the original valley, no DLC is needed.\n\n\nApple Cider Glazed Salmon Disney Dreamlight Valley ingredients\n\n\nTo create Apple Cider Glazed Salmon, you'll need the following ingredients:\n\n\n\nSalmon\n\n\nApple\n\n\nSugarcane\n\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nYou can fish for Salmon in the Sunlit Plateau or the Frosted Heights. If you have some of the DLC, you can also catch it from The Grasslands or The Promenade. They are caught from white ripples in the water as they are a common fish to obtain. Bring a friend from the valley who has the fishing specialty attached to them. For example, I had Mirabel with me. Catching fish with a person with this specialty increases their friendship level and gives you a chance to double your catch.\n\n\nApples can be picked from trees in the Plaza. There is one tree that's right next to my house in the game, making this fruit easy to grab. \n\n\nLastly, Sugarcane seeds can be bought from Goofy in Dazzle Beach. He sells them for 5 Star Coins each. They'll take seven minutes to grow once you've planted and watered them.\n\n\nLet's bring this dish together\n\n\nNow you have all of the ingredients, you can now bring them together in any cooking station. Head to your home or Chez Remy (Remy's restaurant, which also sells Butter, Eggs, and more). Throw all three ingredients into the pot, and you'll have the Apple Cider Glazed Salmon ready to serve. C'est magnifique! \n\n\nYou can sell the Apple Cider Glazed Salmon for 271 Star Coins or eat it for 1,572 Energy. It may also be a dish that a villager requests at Chez Remy.

Even when the IP was in limbo, people kept making awesome mods such as the fully open-world and sandbox Call of Chernobyl. Though STALKER 2 hasn't had anything like that up until now, that's all changing.\n\n\nAs strange as it may sound, none of the STALKER games have released with a proper, full-featured sandbox mode. Sure, Call of Pripyat had post-campaign content if you played your cards right, but that was an exception to the rule. In fact, even STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl has an actual point-of-no-return, which came as a big disappointment to yours truly in particular. Thankfully, the STALKER modding scene knows that this game's true value lies in free-form sandbox goodness, and so the first …",
