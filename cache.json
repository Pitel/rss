Eight years on, we're desperate to see 'Switch 2' get the same treatment.\nTo be clear, the 2017 presentation wasn't the first time we had laid eyes on the Switch — that came in the now-iconic rooftop-party trailer a few months earlier — but it was where all the information dropped. With a Treehouse steam arriving the next day and revealing the launch line-up, the console would land in stores a mere seven weeks later (which is wild, when you think about it), beginning the era of the Switch.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

But Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game — surely a shoo-in for 2025's Clunkiest Title Award — is right around the corner, bringing a slice of Hobbit life to Switch in March.

The slate wiped clean, what if you got to be mates with everyone from all sides in this grand ensemble tale of warring states? A battle might take eight minutes. The three consecutive bonding cutscenes before the next might take ten. Origins is just as much about fighting thousands at a time as it is about eating lunch with Zhang Fei or discussing the meaning of heroism with Zhou Yu. There's a parallel story about your character and his role in a magical order of destiny godlings I didn't find the least bit interesting, but the rest is thrilling because Romance is already thrilling. The parts that Origins bogs down with its wordier take on already wordy source material are enlivened again by anime vibrance, hijinks, and melodrama.\nRead more",

Locator is a detective puzzler where you play an interstellar cartographer tasked with tracking down a missing archeologist named Abigail Lidari on an alien world. It takes inspiration from browser geography game Geoguessr. You’ll be studying sets of photos and comparing them with notes from Abigail’s journal, then pinpointing her location on a series of lovely maps.\nRead more",

Coming soon to press that advantage are the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D, a pair of even higher-spec processors that headlined AMD’s plethora of CES 2025 hardware announcements.\nNo pricing (or exact release date) on these yet, but they both up the core and thread counts over the 9800X3D while peaking at higher boost clock speeds. And, of course, they share the same 3D V-Cache design that makes the 9800X3D such a superlative CPU in the first place. If you don’t know what this is and how it helps game performance, imagine how much faster you could eat Wotsits if you had a massive bucket of them on your desk at all times, instead of having to get up and walk to the kitchen to grab individual packs. In this case the Wotsits are data, the bucket is 3D V-Cache, and the hastened ruination of your digestive system is games running faster.\nRead more",

As Custodian of this dusty funereal expanse, you must place structures on tiles around your throne room, striving to fulfil the desires of whichever Dread Deity is in play, while fending off pernicious attackers from the realm of light.

They managed to complete it in less than five minutes. Not only does the run (and its helpful commentary) serve as a short and sweet explanation of why Barbuta is so glitchily fascinating, it also left plenty of time to marathon another three games from the collection. \nRead more",

One was a cheesy round-up of the best manboobs in video games for Green Man Gaming's long-vanished blog. It was published sometime in 2010, and IIRC, pre-reboot Kratos came out on top. I think/hope it still exists somewhere in the apparatus of Green Man Gaming, hidden beneath the retailer's veneer of respectability like a barrel of radioactive waste. The other boob article was a piece for OXM about Ken Levine saying that he wished people would stop fixating on Elizabeth's cleavage in Bioshock Infinite - a complaint we might consider slightly hypocritical, given the character's visual design.\nNow it's time for boob article number 3: some modder has given 122 of the 150 Jokers in cardgame Balatro big chests. This extends from visibly human Jokers to Joker concepts that shouldn't, strictly speaking, have the capacity for boobage. The banana card has boobs, for example. The credit card card has boobs.

You will supposedly drive sports cars, shoot guns at people, and accrue in-game cash. But its more outlandish claims attracted immediate scrutiny from video creators who found countless inconsistencies in the marketing material. The game has since been removed from the Epic Games Store, presumably for breaking many of the store's rules.

The events will include a player who will beat a set of Elden Ring boss battles using a saxophone as a controller, and 16 minutes of Crazy Taxi with a live backing band rocking out as the driver collects their fares. Other notable events will see two players storming through The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild while sharing a single joypad, and an amorous attempt to clear \"all romances\" in Fallout: New Vegas within 30 minutes - wait, there are romance options in New Vegas?\nRead more",

It reads your save from the first game and everything!\". Say ‘memory card’ to a youthful, broccoli-maned Fortnite enjoyer nowadays. Go on, I dare you. You’ll be in a home before you know it.\nStill, having new toys at regular intervals is one real upshot of our new live-service barrage of ephemeral novelty, perpetually flung at my dizzy eyeballs like gleaming carnival daggers at exhausted spinning wheels. Especially if they’re for the exquisite strategy of Mechabellum. Season 2 released yesterday alongside patch 1.2, bringing with it a new unit and specialist, some reworks, and lots of cosmetic bits I pretend not to care about but then get excited when I unlock a new one.\nRead more",

The titular Judas has managed to break free of the AI-groomed status quo, and is out to start a revolution. \"Bioshock Infinite in space\", we called it, back in 2022, but Levine says it's more open-ended than either of his Bioshock endeavours, with a greater emphasis on other characters remembering and responding to your actions over time.\n Read more",

          "description": "I think the last time I read an actual, original Garfield comic was in 1998. Since then, my experience of the character has been one long litany of Gar-memes and in particular, Gorefield memes. For those blissfully unaware, Gorefield is a version of Jim Davis’s otiose, lasagna-loving housecat who has broken his comic strip shackles and become a cosmic abomination. Gorefield's manifestations are many: centipede Gorefields, arachnid Gorefields, Gorefields that extend serpentine necks of unfleshed bone towards a cowering Jon Arbuckle, demanding to be fed in a voice that sounds nothing like Bill Murray, a voice as deep and velvety as the eternal Monday before the Big Bang.\nIn Gar-Type, a free Gorefield fangame from Youtuber and pixel artist LumpyTouch, Garfield has become a planet. The good news is that, unlike many other Gore-variants, this Gorefield is vulnerable to bullets. It falls to ace pilot Jon Starbuckle and his prototype starfighter, Gar-Type D, to save the Earth from lasagnnihilation.\n Read more",

That's because the studio is still working on the tech behind it all, and plans to release two other games before it. Meaning it'll be 10-15 years before it actually comes out. \nGreene describes Artemis as an internet-like platform where users create and share things, but doesn't say specifically what those things might be. He doesn't know how his user-led \"multiverse of worlds\" will be moderated, or how it will prevent copyright infringement, or what makes this idea distinct from, say, Roblox.

Point being, I can present to you my almost-made-it picks without malice nor bitterness, unlike my loser colleagues who didn’t get as many in the main list. Nyeh nyeh.\nRead more",

I think that's the big theme of my selection box: being grounded within my player character. I want to feel what it's like to hike through canyons with too much sellable loot in my backpack. I want to park my soul in the head of a scared Scotsman way out of his depth, hundreds of miles from shore. The closer I can comfortably fit in my character's shoes, the more I seem to buy into the world they inhabit. Even if that world is constantly glowing a magnificent crimson. \nRead more",

          "description": "My selection box isn't really a selection box. It's a tray of barely-nibbled leftovers, hastily lifted from my Steam backlog. One of the disadvantages of being news editor, you see, is that I have  developed a goldfish-grade attention span. In my hectic pursuit of the next scoop, or the next Elden Ring update changelog, I snatch and cast aside game demos like a pickpocket speedrunning the checkout line at Harvey Nichols. I'm dimly aware that some of these cast-aside games are Very Good. A few might even deserve to be played for longer than 30 minutes. I feel immensely guilty about that. Perhaps a little... existential, too. I have measured out my life in tutorial levels. \r\n\n\r\nSo! Rather than digging out three of the games I've actually completed this year, such as The Crush House, Death Of A Wish and Mask Quest, I'm going to gamble on recommending a few I've barely scratched, but which sure feel excellent and have attracted a positive critical consensus. If I am false in this assessment, may Horace the Endless Bear bite my head off for my impudence. Let's begin.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I’m hoping you’ll forgive a spot of mission-bending here, given Should You Bother With? Is usually intended to test out the new and the strange of gaming hardware. Instead, I want to talk about mini PCs – not just small-form-factor desktops, but properly tiny, box o’ chocolates-sized computers – which have, of course, been around for decades.\nRecently, however, I’ve been wondering if mini PCs are finally on the cusp of having their moment as serious games machines. Between rising desktop component prices and ever-ballooning electricity bills, it would make sense that a smaller, cheaper system would take on a new appeal, and the success of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally show that convenience still trumps out-and-out performance for a lot of PC players. There have even been hints that Valve are resurrecting their Steam Machine mini PC concept, years after a flopping first attempt. Should you be interested?\nRead more",

          "description": "Clambering deep out of the Contemplation Pit, where reading reviews or opinions or, god help you, Takes, is forbidden, I am curious to learn how people have been categorising Songs of Silence. Its structure most resembles Songs of Conquest or Heroes of Might and/or Magic, but with little RPG emphasis or base building, and minimal tactical fighting.\nTaxonomy is arbitrary and often unimportant at the end of the day, but I am very glad to firmly rule it out of one category: It's not a bloody card game. It looks like one, sure. You do most things with cards, and characters acquire more cards over time. But even if you absolutely, utterly, and correctly loathe card-based systems, this game has none.\nRead more",

My weakest skeletons, sensing their death coming, explode into fire and shards. My strongest skeletons fight so hard and with such alacrity that upon dying, they drag their spirits together and keep fighting as ghosts for a while. Foul little bone scorpions skitter around on fans of legs made from human hands. Somewhere in the middle, almost invisible among the noise, is the character I am actually playing: Path of Exile 2’s mean-spirited, callous, and gleefully enjoyable Witch.\nThis is a review in progress. It has to be. Even in its incomplete early access period, Path of Exile 2 is a great sprawling mass of a game. Three meaty acts of a planned six act campaign are followed by a trickier return tour through them, before the absurd endgame kicks into gear and the real work begins. If I came to you having played everything on offer I would be wild-haired, bloodshot-eyed and possessing perfect, incomprehensible knowledge. Let’s compromise: I have toured the dark caverns and the antediluvian crypts. I have been killed by various accumulated nasties. I’ve had a great time.\nRead more",

          "description": "Baví vás bastlení, fyzika, IT a nebo prostě cokoliv technického? Proseděli jste celé Vánoce v záři obrazovky počítače a nebo jste o tom alespoň snili? Chcete se pochlubit technickými vánočními dárky? Pak doražte na Virtuální Bastlírnu - online pokec (nejen) techniků a bastlířů!\r\n\r\n\r\nPokud by se konverzace zadrhla, mají organizátoři ze Strahovské Bastlírny připravena i náhradní výplňová témata. Velká studnice je to, co se dělo na hackerské konferenci CCC (Chaos Communication Conference) mezi svátky - mluvilo se tam o tom, jak se dá shodit rozvodná síť po rádiu, jak hacknout nový procesor Raspberry RP2350 a o tom jak pokračuje hackování vlaků v Polsku.\r\n\r\n\r\nI na svět hardware jsou Strahováci připraveni. Na internetu se objevil postup, jak \"snadno\" vyrábět doma plošné spoje s pomocí výkonného vláknového laseru. Také se v diskuzi našel skvělý spis o tom, jak poznat falešné teploměry DS18B20 a co to vlastně znamená.\r\n\r\n\r\nA nebojte, i na bizár může dojít. Věděli jste, že největší sériově vyráběná CRT televize váží přibližně 200 kilogramů a na světě se už ví jenom o jedné existující? A že Windows interně zkoušejí konvertovat znaky z UTF-16 do ASCII podle jejich grafické podobnosti, což vede k velkému množství elegantních exploitů?\r\n\r\n\r\nPříští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v úterý 14. ledna od 20:00 (pozor, změna) minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

Barely a few days go by without me talking about some of the mods that are out there for The Elder Scrolls 5. Given that the game has been out since November 2011 – and given how tenacious the modding community is – it's hardly surprising there's so much content available, and has been since day one.\n\n\nThey range in scope as well, from funny ones to unofficial expansions to ones that attempt to undo the many, many bugs the game is plagued with.

It also marks the introduction of Magnets, which will be immensely important if you're trying to find high-rated loot. Let's take a look at how to complete this event and what type of rewards you can get.\n\n\nHow to reach the New Year Island in Dig It\n\n\nThe Lunar New Year Island can be found quite easily close to the Mole Island. You can reach it from Noobville, which is the starter island. Almost the entire island is diggable, making it useful for gaining valuable treasures.\n\n\nYou can find 24 new items on the island. Three of those items are Legendary, while two are Mythical. To improve your odds, you can use Magnets in your setup. The New Year Event has also introduced Legendary and Mythical Magnets. In case you couldn't make it out from their names, these Magnets will ensure that you only end up with an item of the same rarity.\n\n\nThe Lunar New Year Island is available in Dig It till January 31, 2025, as it's an event-exclusive location.\n\n\n\n\nAll Lunar New Year Gifts in Dig It\n\n\nThe Lunar New Year introduces three unique gifts as part of the celebrations. Like the 24 new treasures, these three items are also hidden in the terrain. To get them, you'll have to dig them up. However, the three items have different dates when it comes to when you can open them.\n\n\n\nGift of Abundance: January 13, 2025\n\n\nGift of Fortune: January 15, 2025\n\n\nGift of Dragons: January 18, 2025\n\n\n\nThere's a bit of a pay-to-win element about these gifts since you can also just buy them straight from the in-game store.\n\nThe post Dig It Lunar New Year Event guide appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Magnet bait can be easily found even in common crates, along with the more elusive Bait crates. You can also be gifted some Magnet bait if you complete at least five of the quests by the Angler NPC.\n\n\nWhat is the best rod to catch the Treble Bass?\n\n\nSince…",

          "description": "The Ingenuity Unique Utility Belt is a belt in Path of Exile 2 that provides some pretty solid bonuses, such as enhancing your Rings and Flask Recovery. It’s a great item to equip in your build; however, it is not easy to obtain. To help you get it, here is a comprehensive guide on how to get the Ingenuity Unique Utility Belt in Path of Exile 2.\n\n\nHow to get Ingenuity Unique Utility Belt in Path of Exile 2\n\n\nImage via Grinding Gear Games\n\n\nFirst things first, let’s talk about the key features of the Ingenuity Unique Utility belt. Basically, it boosts the bonuses gained from your equipped rings by 40–80%. It is great if you are stacking ring-based modifiers. Not only that, it also gives you the ability to apply a portion of your Flask Recovery instantly.\n\n\nNow let’s head on to how you can get your hands on one. There are mainly two ways to get the Ingenuity Utility Belt. Here are the details:\n\n\nFarming\n\n\nThe most common way to get the Ingenuity Unique Utility belt is by farming bosses or rare monsters with unique modifiers. These enemies tend to have a higher chance of dropping unique items.\n\n\nOf course, it goes without saying that you might have to kill a few before the belt actually drops, but it may take some time. \n\n\nPurchase the belt\n\n\nAnother way to get the Ingenuity Unique Utility belt is by purchasing it. You can also buy it from the official PoE 2 trade site, though it tends to cost a bit, ranging from 15 to 50 Divine Orbs depending on the rolls.\n\n\nAlso, remember that you can only equip one belt at a time. So, while the Ingenuity Utility Belt is a great choice for enhancing ring bonuses and flask recovery, you will have to weigh it against other belts that might offer more resistance or life and mana bonuses.\n\nThe post How to get Ingenuity Unique Utility Belt in Path of Exile 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Ho, ho, ho, Santa is in town. And he’s brought a gift with him. Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.

Ale je to výrazně snesitelnější než \"Oni a Silvio\", především proto, že hlavní hrdinka to celé nějakým smysluplným způsobem spojuje. (Ilča 60 %)",

          "description": "Následuje neupravovaný text zajímavého prohlášení, které vydal můj oblíbenec Varhan Orchestrovič Bauer k nové verzi slovenské hymny:\n\n\nS úctou a upřímnou pokorou jsem přistoupil k aranžmá národní slovenské hymny \"Nad Tatrou sa blýská\" již v roce 2016. Hudebně vychází z původní lidové písně a již dávno zažité sestupné basové linky původně inspirované čardášem. V monumentální instrumentaci zaznívá důstojné a bohaté \"hradní\" Maestoso s výraznou smyčcovou figurací a dramatické Presto s vypjatým protihlasem tak kontrastně jako dunajské nížiny a Vysoké Tatry. Důvodem vzniku bylo hledání krásy a síly slovenské hudby s duchovním nadhledem mně tolik blízké mahlerovské angažovanosti.

Trápení je v průběhu filmu trochu permutováno, ale jde pouze o střípky, které (záměrně?) nevytvářejí žádný dramatický celek, natož zápletku. (Ilča 50 %)",
