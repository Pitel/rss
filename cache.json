          "description": "One goal is to \"protect creators from harassment\".\nIt's fair to say that the incredible growth of the internet and in particular social media has changed its feel a great deal over the years. So of us are old enough to remember when the web was a rather quirky and surprisingly friendly place, but its all-encompassing presence in modern life now leaves websites and social media networks grappling with a variety of factors. How do you support 'free speech' but protect people from harassment and bigotry? How do you encourage honest feedback but shutdown the viral trend of review bombing and sustained downvoting campaigns?\nIn the video above YouTube confirms that, rolling out gradually from today, it'll address part of the challenge by hiding the dislike 'count' on videos. The button will still be there, and disliking content will still influence your recommendations (and likely have some impact on the site's algorithm, but that's a bit of speculation on our part), but the count won't be shown to the public. Creators will still be able to see it in their analytics, though, should they want that data feedback. If you're feeling cynical, too, hiding it from public view may also allow YouTube to sell the data to external marketing agencies in the future.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

With the recent launch of games like Mario Party Superstars and Fisti-Fluffs, it feels like there’s always something new to play within the multiplayer genre. Tossing its hat into the ring, My Singing Monsters Playground shares much of the same DNA as Nintendo’s own Mario Party series, with a plethora of minigames to enjoy with friends and family. It does, however, feel like a bit of a bare-bones experience, lacking an overarching campaign or structure to bind the minigames together.\nBased on a hugely successful mobile franchise, My Singing Monsters Playground features a cast of, well… monsters. Not the kind of monsters that haunt your dreams or hide under the bed, but rather more cute and cuddly monsters that look like they’re on their way to a shindig with Mike Wazowski. Each time you boot up the game, you’re presented with options to select how many players are competing (up to four), before giving a choice of seven different monster designs. Our personal favourite is Furcorn, who looks like a furry bean with legs and a twig sticking out of its head.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

When the rules of a mystery - what the investigator can and cannot do, who and what was where and when - are laid out clearly for the audience, working within those limitations to puzzle out the case (a la any book by Agatha Christie, the who-dun-it queen) becomes irresistible.\r\n\n\nConway: Disappearance At Dahlia View knows exactly what its story, and its protagonist specifically, can and cannot do. Robert Conway can use his decades of experience as a private investigator to look for missing child Charlotte May Morgan, but what he cannot do is leave Dahlia View or get caught by the police. From his wheelchair, Conway surveys his neighbours from the window of his second-floor flat, occasionally venturing down into the quiet courtyard below to infiltrate his neighbour’s homes. Though due to the declines of age or sheer arrogance, he does neither half so subtly as he’d like to think.\r\n\n\r\nWithin these parameters, Conway presents a classic locked room mystery, only the “room” is the neighbourhood of Dahlia View and, unbeknownst to Conway but made known to the audience, this has all happened before.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I know it seems like I only wrote one of these Letters From The Editor five minutes ago, but that five minutes ago was also about three weeks later than it should have been last month, hence the slight double whammy of RPS Treehouse business you’re getting now. But it’s a good thing, really, as my accidental tardiness last month means I can now address some of the issues you raised in our recent RPS reader survey much faster. We’re still digging through a lot of the results right now, but I thought I’d take this opportunity to talk about some of the more general concerns and proposals you mentioned as part of your overall feedback, and how we’re going to be incorporating some of them into our editorial plans going forward. \nRead more",

It doesn't have much to do with From Software’s upcoming action-RPG Elden Ring, but there's one simple lyric in it that perfectly sums up my early hands-on time with the game’s upcoming closed network test: “Caution, I’ll approach you with a business mind / Slight two step as I check the time”.\nFor three days last week, I practically waltzed over to my friend's PS5 (that I, err, 'borrowed', as sadly Elden Ring's closed network test isn't available on PC this time around). If you applied for the CNT and got selected, you'll be able to experience everything I'm about to tell you for yourself starting this Friday, November 12th, until Monday November 15th. But even though my hands-on with Elden Ring was brief, I’m confident that this is Souls taking a step in the right direction. It’s at once new and familiar, but forever exciting.

Of course, what with Amazon's own MMO New World now settling into its third month, not to mention Final Fantasy 14's Endwalker expansion looming on the horizon, Lost Ark arrives at a busy time for fervent EXP grinders. The big question, then, is whether Lost Ark’s Diablo-y formula can do enough to compete with the already well-established MMO juggernauts. Judging by my few hours of hands-on time, I’m thinking it might, but only if you’re able to embrace its slow burn.\nRead more",

Ever since AMD’s Ryzen chips appeared with an alluring balance of gaming speed, desktop multitasking performance, efficiency, and affordability, Intel seemed to sink into a comfort zone of simply raising clock speeds and maybe adding a few cores. \r\n\n\r\nThis was often enough to earn some half-throated recommendations for gaming builds specifically, but this past year proved that something needed to change, with the AMD Ryzen 5 5600X claiming the best gaming CPU title and 11th Gen Rocket Lake Intel chips – like the 5600X’s rival Core i5-11600K – looking thoroughly skippable. For those who did decide to wait until the 12th Gen Alder Lake launch, consider yourselves vindicated, as the Core i5-12600K is a great all-rounder: both a Ryzen-beater in games and, thanks to a long-overdue architecture revamp, a drastically better general purpose processor.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Play the game and you'll quickly realise it does things games aren't supposed to do. Most notably, for me at least, Inscryption makes me feel like I'm actually playing a proper card game; that feeling of being present at a table, slapping cards down on its hard surface. I hadn't realised how crucial this was to my enjoyment of CCGs, until now.\nRead more",

While its core systems take inspiration from 3D platformers of the N64 era, Demon Turf isn’t another Banjo Kazooie successor like publisher Playtonic's Yooka-Laylee. You’ll find those familiar cliches, sure, but there’s something great about Fabraz’s latest effort that goes beyond its unique visuals.\nRead more",

Ubisoft has also revealed some more information about the game’s built-in features such as cross-play and more. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\n“The game will support cross-play and cross-save between all platform families on day one,” Ubisoft’s press release reads. “Owners of both Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege and Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Extraction will instantly unlock the entire roster of 18 operators in Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege and will get the United Front cosmetic bundles in both games.” \nExtraction will also support cross-progression and cross-save across all platforms.

If they decide to pick the game up, their progression will transfer over to the full release, too. \nUbisoft also released a new trailer detailing today’s news and more, which you can watch above. \nToday’s January 20 release date news comes just a couple of months after Extraction was delayed from its original Fall release date to sometime in January.

IGN premiered the trailer for the wall-crawler’s upcoming Hero Event on November 30, which will be exclusive to the PlayStation versions of the game.\nFor those afraid Crystal Dynamics might screw up Spidey from a personality standpoint, the trailer proves he still has his endearingly dorky sense of humor and quips (including making a Mortal Kombat reference of all things). It remains to be seen how Spider-Man’s powers translate into gameplay given there’s no in-game footage. Hopefully, that reveal will come sooner than later given how close we are to Pete’s arrival. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nSpider-Man joins the fray via the Hero Event “With Great Power”. He’ll team up with the Avengers to take on AIM and thwart a mysterious new threat. There’s no indication of how big or long the event is, but it will be free to PS5 and PS4 players. For those playing on other platforms, a big update also hits November 30 that adds a new four-player raid, power level cap increase, and other changes you can read more about here.\n[Source: IGN]",

Join Matt Miller and Alex Stadnik as they take you on a brief 4K tour of some of the things you can expect from Master Chief's next adventure!\nThere's a ton to unpack here, but we're showing off one of the new base encounters for players to frag their way through in today's video. Throughout Halo Infinite's campaign, you'll have to make your way through Banished strongholds to complete your mission, whether that's saving Spartans and UNSC marines or fighting off some of the game's most treacherous bosses. There's no right way to take on these encounters either – one person may find it advantageous to sneak their way through these structures, while others will want to go in guns-a-blazing (like you'll see in the footage above). \nWhile you're giving the Banished hell, don't forget to look around. In today's gameplay video, we show you the location of a Spartan Core, the game's upgrade currency that will enhance Chief's equipment, such as the Grappleshot. \nWe also get to show off one of the game's newest weapons: the Stalker Rife. It's a Banished weapon that feels like it's in the family of the Covenant Carbine, although this semi-automatic rifle packs more of a punch and is perfect for mid to long-range encounters.\nThis is just the start of the fun for fans eagerly awaiting the December 8 release of Halo Infinite! Join us over the next few weeks at Game Informer as we offload a ton of new information about developer 343's latest entry in the iconic series, including a deeper dive into the campaign, our new impressions of the single-player mode, and so much more!

As I checked out a three-hour demo of the campaign, it was apparent that Master Chief’s newest adventure affords the option of a familiar action-packed “golden path.” Like nearly all previous Halo games, Infinite’s mostly linear main story playthrough aims to offer a satisfying and tightly paced adventure, a defined and engaging narrative, and clear objective markers that carry you to the subsequent big setpiece encounter. Based on the extensive demo I experienced, players looking for that classic Halo campaign structure won’t be disappointed.\nHowever, the alternative path through the game sets Halo Infinite apart from what has come before.

These allow players to customize the experience in a given GTA game to their liking. Maybe they have too much police heat on them? A cheat can fix that. Maybe they need a rocket launcher immediately? A cheat can get them that. Really, for a lot of wants and needs in GTA, there’s an accompanying cheat. \nHowever, some of the cheats previously seen in GTA III, GTA: San Andreas, and GTA: Vice City have been cut, according to Rockstar, although the company opted to stay mum on the topic when asked about which ones by USA Today, as reported by Eurogamer. \n“We actually had to remove a couple for technical reasons, certain things that didn’t play well in the Unreal base,” Rockstar Games producer Rich Rosado told USA Today. “But that’s actually where I’ll leave it. There’s some fun with discovery. I’m not saying plus or minus, but I’d rather not just go right on the nose before the release and go straight to the end credits.” \nUSA Today notes that Rosado opted not to reveal which cheats won’t be present. Rosado also opted not to reveal whether or not any new cheats had been added to the trilogy. Perhaps players will soon be discovering new cheats as the remastered trilogy launches today.\nWhile waiting for it to go live, read about how GTA: San Andreas is in development for Oculus Quest 2 and then check out the full music roster for GTA: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition after that.  \n[Source: Eurogamer, USA Today]\nAre you picking up GTA: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition today?

Sure, the GTA series on PlayStation had a reputation for being a vulgar and violent yet captivating sandbox, but the shift to a full 3D Liberty City in GTA3 shattered our perception of immersion possible at the time. Subsequent releases of Vice City and San Andreas built on the mold set by Rockstar, with bigger locations, more vehicles, weapons, activities, and debauchery. As the generations passed and GTA evolved into what we know it to be today with Grand Theft Auto V and GTA Online, the original 3D trilogy became more of a fond memory, left to stay in the past than to be played in their original forms. That is, until today.\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nJoin us for an earlier and extended Game Informer Live at Noon Central on Twitch featuring John Carson and Andrew Reiner. We'll be taking our first look at Rockstar's remastered collection Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition.

Unfortunately, according to a new Bloomberg report, it’s going to be even more challenging as Sony has reportedly cut its PS5 production numbers target by at least 1 million. The company initially aimed to assemble and manufacture more than 16 million PS5s before the end of March 2022, but that number was trimmed to roughly 15 million. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\nBloomberg’s report states that the original 16 million target was named to achieve its sales goal for the period and get a headstart on production for next year. As expected, the reason is “logistics issues and part shortages,” which have grown to be more severe for Sony, according to its chief financial officer Hiroki Totoki in an investors call in October. \nThe PS5 is the first Sony console that reached 10 million units sold the fastest; Sony achieved this milestone in July. Still, Bloomberg reports that the pace has fallen behind due to production issues.

          "description": "Nothing can escape the gravitational pull of February 2022. Not even Valve and its upcoming handheld Steam Deck. The company has announced the initial wave of devices that were supposed to ship out in December will now have a targeted February ship date.\nThe delay is due to the global supply chain issues plaguing many businesses heading into the holiday season. Here's Valve's announcement of the shifted timeline and its reasoning why in full:\nIt looks like Steam Deck reservations that were due later will also be affected. Keep an eye on your Steam account if you've pre-ordered one already.\nWhile it's disappointing to have to wait the extra couple of months, two months isn't a lot longer to wait. Hopefully, this will give Valve the time needed to gather the proper components and ship these bad boys out to the gaming public. \nThe Steam Deck was announced in July promising a device capable of bringing your entire Steam library on the go in a compact Switch-like form factor. You can read about the device from our story on the announcement, and you can check out our suggestions on the best games to play on Steam Deck here.",

          "description": "Spider-Man swings exclusively into the PlayStation versions of Marvel’s Avengers on November 30. Developer Crystal Dynamics finally gave us our first look at the wall-crawler’s design, as well as announcing a trailer set to debut tomorrow, November 11.\nAs you can see in the image above, Spider-Man pretty much looks like Spider-Man. He’s got subtle unique features such as a black grip on the gloves but he doesn’t look much different than his traditional design or what previous alterations have done. We’re not complaining; we’re happy to see Spidey in his familiar glory. \nSpidey joins the fray via the free \"With Great Power\" hero event. Billed as neither an Operation (like Kate Bishop/Hawkeye) or an expansion (like War for Wakanda), it's tough to know how big of an event this will be. The story focuses on Peter Parker uncovering a new threat and joining the Avengers to stop AIM from procuring dangerous, and mysterious, technology. Used to flying solo, Pete struggles with the dynamic of working on a team and we’ll see if he joins the Avengers full time or remains on his own by the end. Crystal Dynamics says the first trailer will premiere via IGN sometime tomorrow. \nFor non-PlayStation players, a big update also launches November 30 that adds a new four-player raid against Klaw, a power cap increase, and the arrival of the loot box-style Shipments. You can read more details about those additions and more here. You can also read about Square Enix's disappointment in Avengers' performance here. \nWhat do you think of Crystal Dynamics’ take on Spider-Man? Let us know in the comments!",

He also revealed that this year’s show will focus more on said games (and presumably trailers) and less on featured celebrities and musical performances. \n“You know, it’s great to have celebrities, it’s great to have music, but I think focusing really on games is important,” Keighley said. “Especially this year, there’ll be a lot of content for 2022 and 2023 that will be showing us our kind of biggest lineup yet of world premieres and announcements. What we learned last year was as that end of the day, it really is the games and the trailers that drive the show.” \nKeighley continued and revealed his Game Awards hand a bit, stating that he expects to feature 40 to 50 games “some way or another” this year. He then added that the number of new games announced during the show will probably be in the double digits. \nThe Game Awards as a whole have drawn criticism from some in the gaming community as being more focused on the game announcements and trailers rather than the actual awards handed out, but it seems that in Keighley’s eyes, they’re necessary in order to put on the show itself. \nThis year’s awards show will be held in-person, as opposed to last year’s mostly virtual event due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. They’ll air on Thursday, December 9. \nWhile waiting for the show, check out all of the winners from last year’s Game Awards show and then read about how The Game Awards 2020 broke an impressive viewership record after that.\nAre you excited about this year's show?

This November alone, the service is gaining Forza Horizon 5, It Takes Two, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas – The Definitive Edition, and more. However, the usual monthly announcement of Xbox Game Pass titles isn't always the only slew of games we learn are coming to the service. \nEvery now and then, Xbox likes to tease some surprise additions and today, the Xbox Game Pass Twitter account began to tease...something. \nThings are going to get a bit...orange this week\nNovember 8, 2021\nThis immediately got our minds racing: what could this game be? Our first thought was Valve Corporation's game collection, The Orange Box. Originally released in 2007, The Orange Box included Half-Life 2 and its two episodes, Team Fortress 2, and Portal. This collection was first released on PC and Xbox 360 before making its way to the PlayStation 3 two months later. While it's playable on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One consoles today via backward compatibility, it's not currently on Xbox Game Pass. Today's tease seems to indicate it might be joining the lineup soon, though. \nBut what if it's not that? Well, we have some other ideas in mind too. Maybe it's the newly-released Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, a Smash Bros.-like fighter starring characters from Nickelodeon TV series. If Nickelodeon is known for one thing (other than slime, of course), it's the color orange. It joining Xbox Game Pass would be a great way to beef up the player count and grow the excitement around the fighter. \nAnother famous \"orange\" in video games is Crash Bandicoot. Perhaps  Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time is coming to Xbox Game Pass. \nThat's enough from us, though. We want to hear what you think this bit of orange coming to Xbox Game Pass sometime this week is. Do you also think it's The Orange Box? What do you hope it is? Did we miss a classic orange in the world of video games? Let us know in the comments below!",

This year, BioWare released a blog post full of looking back at the series impact and this year's release of the Mass Effect Legendary Edition.\nThe blog also details new products fans can buy, sales on the games, and even new Mass Effect-themed Steam emotes. A giant infographic runs down the numbers on big choices Mass Effect Legendary Edition players went with, revealing 15% of people did not recruit Garrus, an option 85% of us can't calibrate our brains or our hearts to leave that precious boy behind. However, there's nary a mention about the future until the end of the post, which says, \"We are, of course, hard at work on the next adventure in the Mass Effect universe.\" We knew that, though, after a teaser trailer premiered at The Game Awards last year.\nIt looked like that's all there was to this year's N7 Day. That is until the image below was posted on Twitter:\nSpeculations are flying left and right, with thoughts and theories about every detail in the picture, from the type of ship parked at the lower half to the crew walking away from it (one looks Krogan, while the rest are humanoid, like most playable Mass Effect species). The crater located at the top of the image looks suspiciously like the head of a Geth, the synthetic beings potentially wiped out by one of the endings in Mass Effect 3. Now, I'm no expert on the series, but the similarities are certainly there.\nWe'll have to wait a little longer for confirmation on what exactly we're looking at here, but until then, we'll have fun watching ecstatic fans comb for any bits of information.\nWhat do you see in the teaser image? Are the Geth for sure back in the ME universe? Does the art have any hints of how BioWare will tie together the original trilogy with Andromeda? Are there other space races you can pick out of the starship lineup? Please give us your best guesses in the comments!",

This week we're tackling Samus' acclaimed Game Boy Advance outing, Metroid Fusion.\nMetroid Fusion launched on November 17, 2002 – the same day as Metroid Prime. Developed by Nintendo R&D1, it stars Samus as she explores a space station overrun by shapeshifting parasites called X. Worst of all, Samus is hunted by an X parasite that has mimicked her appearance and abilities: the SA-X. Metroid Fusion served as a return to the 2D gameplay of Super Metroid with modern improvements such as faster movement and traversal and a ledge grab. Fusion was critically acclaimed as one of the best GBA games ever made; some fans even consider it a rival to Super Metroid as the best entry in the series. Chronologically, Fusion served as the final chapter in the Metroid saga for decades until 2021's Metroid Dread. \nJoin hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and special guest Digital Eclipse editorial director Chris Kohler (@kobunheat) as we explore Metroid Fusion's lore, development history, and lasting impact. \nIf you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

A good shooter tends to contain a smorgasbord of enticing components – gripping atmosphere, weapon/ability balancing, enjoyable arenas, etc. Regardless of style (e.g., FPS, third-person, top-down), the aforementioned features tend to mesh well with polished gameplay, sweeping narratives, and new or improved mechanics.
