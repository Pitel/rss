          "description": "A tactics game of monstrous proportions.\nIf you’ve ever wanted to find out if you could save the world from giant monsters rampaging across the city, you’re in luck. Kaiju Wars gives you the chance to marshal the forces of a small nation beset by a force of five kaiju, each modelled after a famous city-destroying monster from cinema history. The retro graphics hide a surprisingly complicated and satisfying tactics game with a decidedly tongue-in-cheek tone that strikes a decent balance between silly moments and the serious business of saving the world.\nKaiju Wars’ gameplay will be familiar to fans of tactics games. Each map offers different resources and layouts, forcing you to adjust your strategy based on what opportunities present themselves and which of the five kaiju appear. Something you’ll learn early on is that your meagre military forces are no match for the monsters that you’re facing, as most will be destroyed in a single hit and deal minimal damage to them.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

We've seen major industry players make huge acquisitions, two major new Pokémon titles launch, and the delay of what may well be the most anticipated Switch game of all time with The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom slipping to May 2023.\nBefore we settle in for the New Year celebrations and collapse from consuming our body weight in samosas and sausage rolls, a few of our team got together to talk through 2022 and all its ups and downs.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "\"The thrill of victory... and the agony of defeat!\".\nBack in 2017, the Switch library was still in its infancy and this relative lack of competition led to indie projects like Blossom Tales and Blaster Master Zero having far more visibility than they perhaps would in the current, more crowded marketplace. Another big early winner on the eShop was Golf Story, a goofy and quirky take on a golfing RPG that brought to mind Game Boy Color's excellent Mario Golf and proved to be surprisingly appealing to a wide audience. To capitalize on this newfound success, Sidebar Games soon announced a sequel, Sports Story, which would be expanding the gameplay to other sports like BMX biking, soccer (no, it’s not called football), and tennis. After over five years, this hotly anticipated sequel has finally arrived, shadow-dropped two days before Christmas, and… well, it’s alright. Sports Story isn’t a bad game by any means, but it is a supremely disappointing one considering what it could have been.\nSports Story follows your character from Golf Story going on a scenic trip with their coach and friends to an island that evidently has a lot of budget for sporting activities. Though you come there to play golf, it’s not long before you start getting swept up into academies and competitions in a whole host of other sports.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Look at all those games you haven't got round to yet! Maybe 2023 should be the year you really commit to learning Dwarf Fortress, now the Steam version is out. Maybe this is the year you finally give an MMO a try or see your first JRPG to completion. Or maybe this year you're going to uninstall your backlog in its entirety and just accept you're only ever going to play Spelunky from now on.\r\n\nWhat are your gaming ambitions for 2023?

While most of the games I've snuck the odd minutes with – I hesitate to say hours – made it onto our Advent Calendar for Horace’s approval, the three below were a few that made me and my family smile at different points throughout 2022. Roll on 2023 - and even more games.\r\n\n\r\nPossibly my most magical Christmas as a kid was in 1997, aged 12. I got a Saturn and an issue of the UK’s Official Sega Saturn Magazine that had a Christmas NiGHTS Into Dreams disc on the cover. I reckon that it was my favourite, most unabashedly fun time for gaming ever (outside my decades fiddling around on PC, obvs). Indie platformer Lunistice is a blatant love letter to the 32-bit era, and the kind of game that largely skipped the poor old Saturn.\r\n\n\r\nYou guide Hana the Tanuki about as she dreams, aiming to get her to the Moon. Hana properly speeds along, bouncing and spinning her tail to thwack enemies with a lovely splat effect. Devs A Grumpy Fox have really nailed the classic 90s platformer vibe, thanks to all the different dreamworlds that Hana gets to careen through. Don’t expect something open-world like Sonic Frontiers, because Lunistice is deliberately meant to be a linear, short experience. Good grief, could we use more of those. \r\n \nRead more",

Off I went to make a list, running down the published pieces and clicking whichever ones I thought were good. Then I looked at my list and said \"Oh, no!\", because it was extremely long. I cut it down by about half to get what we have here, a collection of interviews and thinky pieces and silly pieces and wonderful pieces from 2022.\nRead more",

I've been looking at that spreadsheet a lot in recent weeks, and I'm pleased to report that most of my top game picks from this year have successfully made their way into the RPS Advent Calendar. There were plenty that didn't, of course (pouring one out for you, Dorfromantik, Flat Eye, Dome Keeper and Lost In Play), but such is the way of things when your current list of completed games for the year is teetering on the verge of 50. \nNo word of a lie, I would probably be here all day if I laid out my entire long list of honourable mentions for 2022 (additional shoutouts to Railbound, Cursed To Golf, God Of War, Weird West, Jack Move, Hard West 2 and The Kids We Were), but for the sake of all involved (and poor Alice Bee's editing pencil), I've narrowed it down to a shortlist of three. (Do still go and check out those other games, though. They're all absolutely rad).\nRead more",

I’m adamant that those games deserve their share of recognition at the end of the year, which is why my honourable mentions celebrate 2022’s new entries into some of my favourite ongoing series.\nRead more",

Over the past twelve months, the RPS treehouse and our merry band of freelancers have reviewed 168 games in total - and that includes early access reviews, PC-port reviews, group reviews, reviews-in-progresses, and your common or garden fully-fledged reviews. 168! Damn. Even though game releases are still suffering from pandemic pushbacks, 2022 has been a busy year for games. There wasn't a huge number of big name releases - although the ones that did come out were plenty big enough - but, as always, we've had a wealth of wonderful indies releasing all year round, and we scooped up as many of them as we could.\nOut of all the games we’ve given any kind of review treatment throughout the year, only a handful of them recieved RPS’s coveted Bestest Best badge; just 22, to be exact. I've gathered them all in one big round-up bundle below (there are round-ups of our favourite bits from other sections of the site, too), and they make a great collection of games.

          "description": "Guides work is a very strange beast, and one that we don't talk about as often as we maybe should. By its nature, we here in guidestown can feel a bit isolated from the rest of RPS. Our guides aren't very visible to our regular readers. No one hops onto a website like this and says to themselves, \"Well now! I wonder what guides have been written today that I can spend my time reading through!\". The vast majority of people who read our guides come straight from a Google search into something specific like \"Can I romance Yennefer and Triss at the same time?\" (spoiler alert: you can, but it may not end well for you).\nBecause we operate so much behind the scenes, it's easy to miss some of the amazing stuff that the team did in guidestown this year. It ain't easy, writing a walkthrough or how-to that's useful for the reader while simultaneously appeasing those nebulous and mercurial SEO gods. But 2022 has been a stonkingly good year for guides, and I'd love to take a little bit of time to shine a light on some of the things we're most proud of having achieved this year - and to toast what will hopefully be another smashing year for guides in 2023!\n Read more",

It is interesting to consider that I could try to wipe the website, delete loads of articles, do something to burn down my job. I don't particularly want to, but the coiled potential to do it exists, because I am unsupervised. There is no other member of staff between me and all of you. The great filter is removed. Any typos are on purpose. How you doin'?\nThis gives me a great opportunity, because I get to have, in a sense, the final word on RPS this year. There are a lot of posts coming up (if we include the Advent Calendar posts that have already gone, we have 50-ish bits of hashtag seasonal hashtag content this year, which I think is the most I've had to schedule for a Christmas break yet), but almost everything after this point is a scheduled post, made of time travel words written days or weeks ago. I'm live and uncensored, baby. I'm going to fire up Among Trees. Let's go and be alone together. But don't worry, I take my responisbility seriously, so I'll make sure the final word is a joke.\nRead more",

I have not done the maths, but I've seen enough graphs, tweets and analysis from people who have crunched the numbers to know there are more games coming out on Steam every day than a site like RPS could ever possibly hope to cover a single month, let alone every week. But gosh darn it if we don't try our hardest all the same. \nInevitably, though, time does get the better of us sometimes (or, in my case at least, maybe my eyes are just too big for my gaming stomach), and certain games end up slipping further and further down our to-do lists until they eventually fall away entirely. Not through any fault of their own, mind. Just... time. But as a final parting shoutout for 2022, I wanted to memorialise all the games that fell of my personal to-do list this year and say, \"I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN IT, I PROMISE!\" (For real, though, I still want to talk about all of these at some point.

For example, the use of 1956 pop song Green Door in free festive indie game Dracula Cha Cha feels so right that to me, it is a Christmas song.

Blizzard have released a roadmap for the next year’s worth of shenanigans for the expansion, with new zones, raids, a megadungeon, and profession changes planned. Two major updates, one each scheduled for the first and second halves of the year, will kick off new seasons for Dragonflight.\r\n\n \nRead more",

But given the game's subject centres on the depiction of women on film, and their exploitation in the film industry by male creators, it felt appropriate to examine it from the extremely talented femme members of the team. That means not just the star Marissa Marcel herself, played by the award-winning Manon Gage, but other women and non-binary creatives who played different roles in bringing this game to life.\r\n\n \nRead more",

You play as an alchemist who has set up shop in an old wizard’s hut, ready to sell your many bubbling brews and concoctions to the locals. People will come by the shop during the day banging on about their problems, so you need to listen to each customer's issue, create an appropriate potion to help, and receive a lovely handful of gold in return. It’s essentially a shop management sim, since you make money, buy ingredients, and haggle to get a good deal. But the best part of Potion Craft is all in the title; it's getting to grips with the art of potion brewing.\nRead more",

It's worth writing about though, so here I am, doing that. It's a weirdo little first-person action-adventure game where you play as the 16-year-old Yaga, who has been run into the forest because the local villagers think she's in league with the witch Baba. If you know any European folklore you may have reason to suspect they're right.\nYaga's childhood friends have all vanished, along with her sister, and the game sends you off to breadcrumb trails around a bright, unreal forest, to find the memories of what happened to the unfortunate kiddies. Along the way you grow in power and skill, using different types of arrows with your bow, as well as lures and spells. I like Blacktail because it's a little bit janky in ways that don't break the game, and is absolutely committed to its own particular flavour of odd. It's the kind of game you used to see a lot in the early-mid 00s, and just don't get much anymore.\nRead more",

In fact, the final Whatcha Been Playing of 2022, as today will see another year shuffles off out of door, shrugging its shoulders and probably blaming you. I'm very grateful to all of you for showing up this weekend, and hopefully you've recovered from the festive carnage of last week in time to wreak further havoc this evening.\nI myself had a fine and quiet Christmas, which was exactly what I was looking for. I ate too much and re-visited No Time to Die and Gremlins. So, in a sense, I spent my Christmas with Ana de Armas and Phoebe Cates and nobody can tell me otherwise.

          "description": "Let us make a journey to the cave of monsters...\nAs the year closes out, the retro enthusiasts over at Hamster Corp have one more offering for 2022, bolstering the Arcade Archives range with nothing less than one of the most iconic video games of all time: Taito's Bubble Bobble.\nReleased to the freshly rejuvenated arcade scene in 1986, Bubble Bobble practically needs no introduction. This single-screen platformer sees one or two players step into the scaly suits of bubble-blowing dinosaurs Bub and Bob, as they descend through 100 levels of monsters and mayhem on a quest to rescue their abducted sweethearts. Facing off against a plethora of strange and instantly recognizable villains — including the notorious Baron Von Blubba — Bubble Bobble provided aracde goers one helluva challenge, and remains a fun and compelling experience decades down the line.\nCheck out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber AL82 Longplays.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTR0xqRCfUk&ab_channel=AL82RetrogamingLongplays\nThanks to its super-cute characters, colorful world, and instantly recognizable theme tune, Bubble Bobble would become one of the most financially successful arcade games of its day, leading to a series of home ports, various sequels and spin-offs, and a place in the annals of game history. Bub and Bob would go on to continue their adventures in 1987's Rainbow Islands, and would make a notable comeback with the block-busting smash hit series Puzzle Bobble. This is not to speak of a multitude of remakes, remasters, and rereleases, or Bub and Bob's frequent cameo appearances in many of Taito's other hits.\nBubble Bobble is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nThe post Arcade Archives closes out 2022 with the iconic Bubble Bobble appeared first on Destructoid.",

He’s also shown up in a wide array of video games. Sadly, these games really aren’t worth playing. In fact, if you’re buying a game where Superman is the star, there’s a good chance you’ll come to regret that purchase within an hour of playing it.

I was going to play it in full, but Horizon Forbidden West put me off of paying full price for sequels to games I dislike (and 2018's God of War left me pretty cold).

These include Paramount Pictures' hugely successful sequel Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sega's major PC and console release Sonic Frontiers, retro compilation Sonic Origins, and the recent Netflix animated series Sonic Prime. And that's not to mention the launch of the new Sonic LEGO line, which debuted almost one year ago to the day.\nRiding high off of new interest in the iconic Sega mascot, Iizuka notes that Sonic Team is far from done with the series, and hopes to continue this wave of new multimedia endeavors well into 2023 and beyond. As good as 2022 has been for Sonic and pals, it looks like the coming year intend to build upon the series new and veteran fanbase.\n\"We are preparing a second wave to keep the fans happy and maintain that momentum going into 2023,\" notes Iizuka. \"We already announced additional content for Sonic Frontiers, but there is a lot more outside of that, so please look forward to it.\"\nSonic Frontiers and Sonic Origins are available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

          "description": "'We need 1 more week to ensure quality'\nAlthough folks on the majority of Stardew Valley platforms have been enjoying update 1.5 for quite a while now, the mobile edition still needs one final push. That was supposed to come by the end of the year, but a new tweet from developer Eric \"ConcernedApe\" Barone has some insight into the final, final deadline for the patch.\nHere's the full context from the tweet:\n\"MOBILE: The porting team and I have been working extremely hard this past week on the 1.5 update. We're so close. We could probably release right now. But we need 1 more week to ensure quality. I accept full responsibility for not hitting the end of year target.\"\n\nAs far as I'm concerned: no worries! Stardew Valley has earned so much good will at this point, that folks can wait a bit more for an update. It helps that the game is also on basically every platform under the sun, so there are options available.\nThat said, it's admirable to see Barone taking responsibility, even if it's not needed. This whole saga has been a masterclass on transparency and communication; and how developers can opt to treat their fans in an era of nonsense, especially given how Stardew basically gives everything out for free.\nhttps://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1608709035318206465\nThe post Long-waited Stardew Valley 1.5 mobile update is ‘close,’ but needs one more week appeared first on Destructoid.",

In addition, a new Wearable allows players to don the Madrigal Miracle Candle — a symbol of pure love that is able to bestow seemingly impossible magic on the family's descendants. Just watch out for hot wax on the ol' noggin.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WX7mR39H3rg&t=51s&ab_channel=PlayStation\nIn addition to these four skins, players can also purchase two new emotes — featuring some sweet dance steps, as well as a selection of nicknames and nameplates. The Fall Guys Encanto DLC is available to purchase from the Fall Guys in-game store from now until January 3, so move fast if you want to make sure that Luisa finds her way to the crown. And woe betide anybody standing in her way.\nOh, and if you haven't seen Encanto, perhaps check it out this weekend.

Silent Hill: The Short Message has been newly rated for PS5, following on from its previous rating in Korea back in September.\nThe curious element here is that The Short Message was not one of the titles listed during Konami's Silent Hill Transmission presentation, held by the studio back in October of this year. The live stream contained several new titles pertaining to games, films, and even an interactive streaming project, but \"The Short Message\" was not among them.\nPerhaps this mysterious release pertains to a prologue demo — dare I say, a \"Playable Teaser\" — for one of the newly announced titles. Until Konami is ready to show its hand, we'll just have to wait and see.\nStill, with Bloober Team's Silent Hill 2 remake on the horizon, not to mention Silent Hill: Ascension, Silent Hill: Townfall, and period piece adventure Silent Hill: F, it seems that fans of fog and monsters have plenty of unholy horrors headed their way in the coming years.

Shortly after, it hosted some DLC in the form of the Dunwall City Trials (challenge maps), and two story campaigns (Knife of Dunwall, The Brigmore Witches). All of that is included in said Definitive Edition (on top of the Void Walker's Arsenal bonus), which is a pretty great deal: especially given that I liked some elements of the DLC more than the main game. I'd consider this a pretty good New Year's present, and it's definitely worth playing through if you have a rainy holiday weekend coming up.\nThe promotion went live this morning, and will run through January 5, 2023 at 11:00AM ET. At the moment, Eximius: Seize the Frontline is also available until that exact time, at which point Kerbal Space Program and Shadow Tactics: Aiko's Choice will be cycled in.

          "description": "The biggest takeaway? Quaxly lost\nAs has been their custom for a while now, Japanese site GameWith ran a massive poll to see what people's favorite Generation 9 (Scarlet & Violet) Pokemon were, and the results were both predictable in some cases, and shocking in others. Let's break it down.\nTinkaton wins big, and Quaxly loses massively\nVoting took place from December 16, 2022 through December 23, 2022, and had a total of 177,829 participants. For those of you who are interested, here's a brief overview of the top 10:\nTinkaton\nClodsire\nSprigatito\nFuecoco\nCeruledge\nTatsugiri\nSylveon\nSlither Wing\nLucario\nGardevoir\nIf I had to bet money on it before the fact, I would have predicted Tinkaton in the top 10, especially given the design, type, and overall strength of the newcomer. Seeing a form of Sprigatito and Fuecoco in the mix (the top five no less) makes a lot of sense too. But suspiciously absent from the top 10 (nay, the top 30 entirely) is Quaxly. Many spot polls showed the water starter lagging behind the other two, but this is just something else.\nMany other picks are logical. Lucario is still a standout Pokemon and has many many appearances in other media/spinoffs. Sylveon continues to be one of the more popular Eeveelutions, and given its penchant for Tera Raid power, it's a no-brainer in Generation 9. Many folks were also really high on Slither Wing from the jump, and Gardevoir maintaining its popularity was a given.\nGoing further beyond the top 10, Koraidon (Scarlet) has beaten Miraidon (Violet) as the most popular box legendary, and multiple Eeveelutions made the list, as did Charizard, who is only available via 7-Star Raids. You can find the entire list below!\nHere are the most popular Scarlet & Violet Pokemon poll results:\nhttps://twitter.com/pokemon_GW/status/1607313129972838401\n[caption id=\"attachment_356025\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via GameWith[/caption]\nThe post New poll from GameWith shows us the top 30 most popular Scarlet & Violet Pokémon appeared first on Destructoid.",

Inspired by the much-loved Dark Souls franchise, the development team set out to make a similarly toned adventure where every single swing of the blade mattered, where life and death rest on the edge of one right (or wrong) decision in the heat of battle, and where swift adaptation to each enemy is the key to victory.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSs0_PBGiLs&ab_channel=PlayStation\nIn Mortal Shell, players can inhabit the bodies (or \"mortal shells\") of the deceased, gaining access to their skills, weapons, and abilities. As such, the combat in the game has a natural evolution, as the player passes from body to body, learning new skills on the fly and adapting to the reconfiguration of their offensive and defensive maneuvers. Mortal Shell received plaudits on release for its smart combat and compelling challenge, with many noting that its unabashed love of the FromSoftware titles was readily apparent, with some reviewers noting that it felt like playing Dark Souls for the first time all over again.\nMortal Shell is available to download for free from Epic Games Store.

          "description": "The new NieR adaptation is right around the corner\nNieR fans won't have to wait too long into the new year for its anime adaptation to kick off. The NieR: Automata anime has locked in a premiere date for January 7, 2023 in Japan.\nA few trailers have been dropping over the holidays for the upcoming anime adaptation of 2017's NieR: Automata. The first features 2B and 9S fairly prominently, as two leads we'll be following in the Ver. 1.1a anime.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGpskkA7vrw\nAnother new trailer today shows off some of the supporting cast, as well as the opening and ending tracks for the series. Both trailers have a January 7 premiere date set for the adaptation. We already knew it was arriving sometime in January, but it looks like the date is much sooner in the month than one might have expected.\nMost of the adaptation is covering some familiar territory, given what we see in the trailers. There is one character, Lily, who appears in the lore but seems to be playing a larger role in the anime. It'll be interesting to see how much this Ver 1.1a diverges from the game.\nBecome as gods\nThe series looks set to air on Crunchyroll as well as other platforms, though exact distribution plans and dates aren't clear just yet. We'll have to see just what the global rollout looks like as the series goes live.\nNieR: Automata isn't the only video game adaptation kicking off in January 2023, either. HBO's The Last of Us is set to debut not too long after on January 15, 2023. And the animated Dragon Age: Absolution just recently went live on Netflix, too. It's quite the time for video game adaptations, and there's even more on the way. Hopefully they can turn out as well as shows like Arcane and Cyberpunk: Edgerunners have.\nThe post NieR: Automata anime locks in its air date and some new trailers appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Jedi, nukes, and an ominous future\nThe new year is almost upon us, and with it a new month of PlayStation Plus titles. Sony has revealed the three games headed to PlayStation Plus to kick off January 2023, including a good way to brush up ahead of a big 2023 release.\nHeadlining the January 2023 PS Plus offering is Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, the single-player action-adventure game from Respawn following runaway Jedi Cal Kestis. It's a good grab for anyone who needs to catch up on the story, as its sequel Jedi: Survivor is due to arrive in March. It's not a large window, but Fallen Order should be easy to blast through in that amount of time.\nFor a little more multiplayer, Fallout 76 heads onto PS4. Though there's been an ongoing tussle over the Microsoft-Activision Blizzard acquisition, Bethesda's multiplayer Fallout will be free to grab for PlayStation Plus users in the month of January 2023.\nClosing out the month is Axiom Verge 2, the follow-up to the first Axiom Verge. While it takes a more action-platforming approach with fewer guns and more exploration, it's still a solid experience worth checking out if you enjoy exploring a map and ticking off squares.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRaobDJjiec\nA new year of Plus\nWhile those three games head to every category under PlayStation's tiered Plus system, more is on the way for those at the higher tiers. The PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium lineup for January is set to be announced soon.\nThese PlayStation Plus games, meanwhile, go live on January 3, 2023. And if you haven't yet, there's still time to add Mass Effect: Legendary Edition and the other December PlayStation Plus games to your library before they go away.\nThe post PlayStation Plus kicks off 2023 with Fallen Order in January appeared first on Destructoid.",

While 2022 has been a great year for games in general, from heavy hitters like Elden Ring and God of War Ragnarok to indie darlings like Cult of the Lamb and Vampire Survivors, I think this past year has been one of the best we've seen for narrative games in a good while due to the breadth of stories that were told both thematically and mechanically.\nWhether those stories were rooted in lighthearted, optimistic sentimentality or a grounded, gritty introspection, I was reminded time and time again why I'm so excited for games to continue paving the way forward as our youngest and most dyna…",

The classic shmup series take to the stars once again when it launches in Japan on PS4 and Nintendo Switch in March 2023.\nAs we have previously reported, Ray’z Arcade Chronology compiles the three original titles from the franchise — namely RayForce (1994), RayStorm (1996) and RayCrisis (1998) — with a newly revamped edition of the 2013 remaster RayStorm HD, complete with brand new features including a classic 4:3 screen ratio and the original arcade dipswitch settings. The compendium is then rounded out with a brand new remaster of RayCrisis, titled RayCrisis HD, specifically developed for this new release.\nRay’z Arcade Chronology will launch in Japan March 9, 2023, on PS4 and Nintendo Switch. Western fans of the pew-pew persuasion need not fret, as publisher ININ Games has already confirmed that it will be localizing the collection for western release, although a specific launch date is yet to be announced.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Axxz_iaJ0Jc&ab_channel=taitochannel\nThe post Ray’Z Arcade Chronology getting set to shmup in 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Longtime MGS producer Noriaki Okamura wrote in a recent issue of Famitsu that \"2023 will be a year of many announcements,\" as reported by Gematsu. \nIn this special end-of-the-year issue of Famitsu, multiple Japanese developers and producers wrote quick teases about what 2023 might hold for them. It's here where Okamura teased that 2023 will be a year of announcements for Konami Digital Entertainment. More specifically, he said \"Other than [the educational edition of Momotaro Dentetsu announced last year], 2023 will be a year of many announcements,\" and that his keyword for 2023 is \"long-awaited,\" as noted by Gematsu. \nNow, this could just be his way of saying that Konami, as a whole, will make some announcements and that maybe some of them will be long-awaited by fans. However, given that it's Okamura – a longtime MGS producer – saying this, there's reason to believe that maybe he's teasing a return to the MGS series. Perhaps we're getting a remake of one of the games, or maybe a new mainline entry.

The narrative-driven shooter is set in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone in a post-apocalyptic world laden with dangerous mutated monsters. Players must fight their way to the heart of the zone while steering the non-linear plot through choice-driven gameplay. \n\n\nFormally confirmed in 2020 after years of start and stop announcements, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 has had a tumultuous development. After announcing and quickly canceling NFT plans due to fan backlash in December 2021, the project came to a screeching halt in February due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, where GSC is based. Many employees were forced to evacuate their homes in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital. Other designers chose to defend the city. One of GSC’s designers who volunteered to fight, Vladimir \"Fresh\" Yezhov, was recently killed in combat. \nS.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl is slated to arrive on Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass) and PC in 2023. It was one of the many titles to get bitten by the delay bug and pushed into next year, a list you can check out here.",

The video intentionally didn’t explain what the game was, but beyond including the word Aperture in the title, it was clear it took place in the Portal universe. The end of the trailer revealed it would be releasing only a few days later, and it would be free.\n\n\nAs promised, the game released on March 1 and it feels like nobody played it, which is a shame because it is a fantastic, “Playable Short,” as Valve refers to it.\nAperture Desk Job doesn’t have portals in it, but it is a Portal game.

The mod outfits the Tarnished in the significantly less protective garb of Pokémon trainers, who cruise the dangerous landscape atop the motorcycle-like Koraidon. The video highlights how Elden Ring would be an even better game if it had Lechonks and Quaxlys roaming about, though that doesn't make it any less dangerous, as evidenced by one particuarly brutal Pokémon ambush.

          "description": "Each mainline entry of the Street Fighter series is an important milestone in the fighting game genre. Though every numbered entry received critical acclaim, Street Fighter V sticks out among fans as the outlier of the series; the game experienced perhaps the most tumultuous launch of any Street Fighter game to date. But out of that trouble emerged something great. Thanks to the team’s persistence, post-launch roadmap, and an injection of new blood into the project's leadership, Street Fighter V drastically improved its core gameplay, online play, content offerings, and more throughout its six-year lifespan.\nWith the benefit of those lessons learned, many team members that righted the ship are back to develop Street Fighter 6. The latest entry delivers myriad improvements, new features, and a sleek new aesthetic while simultaneously acknowledging and paying homage to each entry before it. Street Fighter 6 feels like yet another evolution of the fighting game genre ushered in by the franchise that pioneered it in the first place. Read more...",

After more than 150 hours roaming the Lands Between, I feel the familiar bittersweetness that occurs anytime I finish a game I love. I’d conquered unimaginable horrors and become Elden Lord in my own personalized adventure, all while cruising atop a cool double-jumping steed; now what? Recovering from this high would become a personal struggle for the remainder of the year.\nElden Ring dominated my life. When I wasn’t playing it, it was the only thing I wanted to do.

Its minigame-centric fights and awkward movement were damning, but it also lacked the silly, over-the-top violence Mortal Kombat is known for – a sad reality for appeasing license holder Warner Bros. Batman can cripple impoverished criminals, but he can’t be cut in half by Tarkatan blades.\nIt would have been disappointing to end on an ill-fated crossover, but Midway’s untimely demise could have made that so. Layoffs, uncertainty, and publisher implosion aren’t how franchises live; it’s how they die. But the then-newly formed NetherRealm Studios reinvigorated the entire franchise after its darkest period with one of its most beloved entries: the 2011 reboot, Mortal Kombat 9. Read more...",

I have vague memories of seeing a TV commercial for the original PlayStation game when I was young and remember playing the game’s first few hours in a friend’s attic between Mat Hoffman’s Pro BMX sessions. It wasn’t until much later, when I found an inexpensive green label copy at a Circuit City, that I gave it another shot, but, again, I only made it through the first few hours. When Square Enix released it in such a way that I could play it on my PlayStation 3 and move it over to my PSP, I made it the furthest. I left Midgar, saved my game, and turned off my PSP, fully lying to myself that I would pick it back up again soon.

As one of the most profitable games in arcade history, Street Fighter II drew more than its fair share of quarters and tokens during the arcade heyday. But the franchise transcends that one moment in time. To say that Street Fighter has sparked multiple revolutions in its genre throughout its history is not far-fetched.\nArcades aren’t omnipresent the way they once were, but the Street Fighter name has endured the ever-shifting grounds of the games industry. The fierce fistfights made the leap from mall game rooms to the living room, the internet, and even tournaments broadcast to massive, international audiences. As the franchise turns 35 years old, we met with the people involved to understand the series’ origins and how it remains relevant three-and-a-half decades later. Read more...",

The gamble paid off in spades. Inspired by both 1930s animation and classic games like Contra and Gunstar Heroes, Cuphead has sold more than six million copies, amassing critical acclaim, legions of fans, a TV show, and multiple world records along the way.\nWith Cuphead’s staggering success, it’s not too surprising the team at MDHR wanted to deliver one more serving of sharp shooting excitement and aggravation. Opting for DLC as opposed to a full-on sequel, the Cuphead developer set about outlining The Delicious Last Course, released in June 2022. Early in production, MDHR decided that a boss concept from the original game, one scrapped due to time constraints, would be the perfect starting point for this newest outing. Read more...",

          "description": "Even though it’s a remake of a game released in 2013 for the PlayStation 3, The Last of Us Part I is, in most respects, the same game as the original The Last of Us. Players first experiencing the game through the remake will understand the plot in much the same way. They follow the same story to the same conclusion, meeting the same characters and feeling many of the same feelings. They experience the same vision of a post-apocalyptic United States, where one traumatized man, Joel, reckons with his inability to part with his surrogate daughter, Ellie.\nBut even a remake sticking as close to the original script and general design of its original as Part I is, ultimately, a new game in its own right. By making a game look “better” than it did before, it’s changed into something else. Whether in small or large ways, it is altered. Read more...",

Beginning next month, NieR:Automata Ver1.1a will begin airing in the United States on Crunchyroll.\nYou can check out a brand-new trailer for the show below: \n\n\nFrom the looks of it, Ver1.1a will stick close to the storyline from the video game, released in 2017 as a partnership between publisher Square Enix and developer Platinum Games. Series creator Yoko Taro is also involved with the project. \nThe series is in production at A-1 Pictures, a subsidiary of Aniplex. In the past, the production house has worked on series such as Black Butler, Your Lie in April, Fate, and Sword Art Online. Ver1.1a is being directed by Ryoji Masuyama, who's previously worked on KILL la KILL, Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance and Evangelion: 3.0+1.01 Thrice Upon a Time, as well as Gurren Lagann.\nNieR:Automata Ver1.1a will begin airing in Japan on January 7, 2023. As of right now, it's not entirely clear what day it will hit Crunchyroll. However, the streaming service does often have the right to begin showing anime in the west within 24 hours of their original airtimes, so time will tell if Nier gets the same treatment.",

Fans were excited about the sequel for several reasons – that original reveal trailer was great – but the question on many minds was this: Why is Dead Island 2 set somewhere that’s not an island? \nI traveled to Nottingham, England to visit Dambuster Studios, and this was one of the first questions I asked. Unsurprisingly, considering this is the team that's been developing this game since 2018, lead narrative designer Khan had an in-depth answer. \nSimply put, Los Angeles has become an island, metaphorically speaking. \nDead Island 2 begins in the final days of the evacuation of LA after the zombie outbreak has swept through…",

The surprise launch comes a month and a half after the developer gave us a December 2022 release window for the long-awaited follow up to its 2017 smash hit, Golf Story.\nGolf Story provided players a retro-styled RPG with a zany story centered around golf of all kinds: regular, disc, and more. Sports Story sees SideBar Games expand the formula to include various other athletic events, including BMX, tennis, cricket, soccer, volleyball, fishing, and more. If you loved the golf of Golf Story, don't worry: That sport carries over to Sports Story, bringing with it eight unique golf courses. \nYou can see the full video, which also provides updates for Sea of Stars, Undying, and Dust & Neon, below.\n\n\nGolf Story, SideBar Games' predecessor to Sports Story, arrived on Switch on September 28, 2017. In our review, we called it \"a breath of fresh air for sports, and another fun story to follow for role-playing fanatics,\" awarding it a 9 out of 10. Sports Story was initially announced by SideBar Games in December 2019, with long stretches of silence from the development team. Then, during last month's Indie World Showcase from Nintendo, the developers finally announced that the game would arrive at some point in December 2022.\nSports Story is available now for Switch.",

As for what to expect, though, that remains unknown – Santa Monica Studio says it'll \"share more details once we get closer to the release.\" \n\n\nWhile many had hoped Ragnarök would launch with a New Game Plus mode built-in, its arrival after the game's release isn't surprising.

In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch today at 3 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares.

The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

Check out the animated announcement trailer below. \n\n\nIn a press release, Hopoo Games co-founder Duncan Drummond says that, “As we chart our future as developers, it was important to us that we look back on our early work. Risk of Rain Returns is a small token of our appreciation to this incredible community. We hope everyone is as excited about the future as we are.” While still developed by Hopoo, Risk of Rain Returns will be published by Gearbox. \nRisk of Rain Returns will be available on Switch and PC.

Overcoming these missions unlocks new modifiers that introduce alternative combat moves, cheats, and outfits.

Many have been anticipating this long-awaited sequel since its original reveal back in 2014, just a few years following the franchise's start. That's why I went to Nottingham, England, to go hands-on with the game for more than seven hours. And soon, you can read everything I learned because Dead Island 2 bloodies up this month's cover of Game Informer. \nGame Informer video editor Alex Van Aken and I visited Dambuster Studios in Nottingham to play two extensive portions of Dead Island 2, talk with the game's director about its development and why the team started with a blank slate, learn from the narrative lead about why a game with \"island\" in its name is set in…",

Now that he’s reached the top of the mountain, the series is giving the perpetually young hero his last hurrah before kicking off a fresh adventure starring a new cast of characters.\n\n\nThe Pokémon Company announced that beginning January 13 (in Japan), Ash and Pikachu’s final chapter begins. It consists of 11 special episodes serving as a grand send-off celebrating the duo's achievements. It also features some familiar faces from Ash’s past, including Misty and Brock.\nSometime later in the year, a new yet-to-be-titled animated series set in Scarlet/Violet’s Paldea region kicks offs. It stars two young trainers, Liko and Roy, joined by the three starters of that region: Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly. The trailer also teases the appearance of a shiny Rayquaza.\nSo this is it. If you spent your childhood following Ash's exploits or have stuck with him for his entire run, how does it feel to finally see the character get his flowers and ride off into the sunset?

Evath's moon Mitral has turned into a gigantic gas time bomb. A meteor is also due to impact Mitral in the next several hours. You were chosen to secure each of Mitral's 18 sectors by positioning a drilling rig over the gas pockets in each sector before the meteor strikes.\nSolve challenging riddles by relying on geological clues, intuition, or good old trial and error. To survive your mission, find Rubicon crystals to restore energy and destroy (or avoid) the Laser Beacons and Skanners left behind by the Ketars. Good luck!\nOur reimplemented engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Driller support is limited to DOS (EGA mode), Amiga and AtariST releases, but we hope to be able to add more soon! Please contact us if you have some other release.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build.
