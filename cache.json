One of the year's very best in this genre though (if you ask us, that is), is Wargroove 2, a gorgeous sequel that we described as a \"must-play\" in our 9/10 review. Well, it has just landed itself an update.\nReleased last night, this patch brings the game up to ver. 1.2.5 and introduces some tasty new features for those who are interested in some multiplayer battling. As its name suggests, the \"Multiplayer Ranking Update\" brings (you guessed it) multiplayer ranking to the game. This keeps things nice and fair on the online play front, with matchmaking now informed by a player's ranking to hopefully produce a level playing field.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Very late: the evergreen free-to-play dark fantasy action-RPG launched literal generations ago in 2013, the heyday of Bioshock Infinite and GTA 5. (It's still arguably the heyday of GTA 5. Bioshock Infinite, not so much.) It's my understanding that New Zealand-based developer Grinding Gears have released approximately one bazillion Path of Exile updates and expansions in the decade since, the latest of which, Affliction, is briefly detailed in a boxout down the page. \r\n\n\r\nI am not your guy for blow-by-blow descriptions of what Affliction adds to Path of Exile. My cautious summary would be: lots of terrifying trees, and lots of modifiers. I am, however, your guy for a newcomer's snapshot verdict on the sequel ahead of the closed Path of Exile 2 beta on 7th June 2024. In a twist so far-fetched they might just pull it off, the new game is designed both for returning players and newcomers, and I think a lot of that is epitomised by the just-announced Mercenary class, which reflects game director Jonathan Rogers's desire to create combat mechanics that are at once more involved and more inviting.\r\n\n \nRead more",

One of them was Spine, an upcoming action game that asks the question: what if Sifu also had guns? The new gameplay trailer shows street artist heroine Redline punching, kicking and shooting her way through a cyberpunk-themed world of thugs and armoured guards, and her fancy footwork and the equally agile camera framing looks like it could be quite the combo when it eventually comes out in 2025. Alas, the trailer doesn't give away much else, but I spoke to developers Nekki ahead of tonight's showcase to find more about it, and how it's taking direct inspiration from Sifu and John Wick to become the next big cinematic beat 'em up.\nRead more",

In the case of my multiplayer hands-on, that empire was the Ix'Idar, a race of burrowing insect critters with a unique resource - pheromones. Boldly disregarding the PR's gentle advice that I start with an easier-to-master race, I set out to swarm the galaxy and immediately found myself at the bottom of the victory or \"Succession\" point scoreboard, with one player picking off my planets by means of espionage, while others stomped my fleets of stargrubs flat in no-nonsense space combat. \r\n\n\r\nI did manage to briefly take possession of the titular Nexus, a throneworld which awards beaucoup Succession points to its owner, but it turns out fixating on the Nexus is a great way to set yourself up for a midgame dogpile - you pour resources into capturing it, sacrifice half your fleet to the first invader, then lose it all to the second. With my initially bountiful dominions rudely shrunk to a smattering of isolated planets, I took the coward's way out of the press event and said I had to be going because I had other work to attend to. I didn't at all! I just wanted to go and cry in the toilet. Alas for the Ix'Idar - not so much \"lions led by donkeys\" as an antfarm in the hands of a wilful toddler.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only... compromise, calculation and license to misbehave. In Owlcat's forthcoming RPG Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, you play the free-wheeling head of an interstellar merchant's dynasty. Operating on the fringes of uncharted space, you're the owner of a Warrant of Trade that essentially lets you run your own miniature empire within the Imperium, deciding the fates of planets, amassing vast wealth and recruiting a motley crew of xenos, heretics and assorted weirdos. It's the kind of behaviour that'd get you vaporised if you were some run-of-the-mill Space Marine Chaplain, but out here on the frontier, you're allowed to act with impunity, providing you fulfil your overall mandate of adding to the God Emperor's glory and kicking the odd Eldar's head in.\r\n\n\r\nRogue Traders are arguably the only characters in Games Workshop's brutal and decrepit table-top setting that lend themselves to the role of CRPG protagonist, because they are the only characters in Warhammer 40K's Imperium who enjoy anything like the plot agency of a Commander Shepard. And with that, I think, comes an interesting transformation of the character alignment systems the game shares with other CRPGs such as Baldur's Gate 3.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The new Pale Reach DLC gets even weirder, a masterpiece of show-don’t-tell horror that manages to evoke some of the more inspired Bloodborne monsters as well as some of icy, supernatural scares from The Terror. And it's all centred on a big whale. \r\n\n\r\nSpoilers ahead, friends, but in The Pale Reach, a massive icy landscape has suddenly appeared in the southern, well, reaches of Dredge's world, so naturally we’re off to see what that’s all about, ploughing along in our faithful fishing boat to the hostile new climate. Every path into the landmass is barricaded by imposing ice walls. It's a slog.\r\n\n\r\nIt’s also a great setup. We're made to instantly wonder what the hell hides in this treacherous ice field, and the answer is equally great: a massive corrupted narwhal with bulbous glowing eyes. The huge beast dwarfs your tiny ship, but mercifully it’s frozen solid in an even bigger chunk of ice, with only those very angry eyes poking out at us. Four angry eyes on one side of its head, to be very precise.\n Read more",

We spotted a deal on the latest full-size Stream Deck over at Currys, where you can pick it up for £119 versus the original £149. \nRead more",

          "description": "Fewer games than I'd like have captured that feeling of everything getting really out of hand. Not just getting harder, but putting you in a situation that's truly deteriorating all around you.\nLast Train Home has an intriguing premise: taking the Czechoslovak Legion home from the Eastern front via an armoured train directly through the chaos of the Russian Civil War. Its unusual mixture of survival sim, RPG, tactical skirmishes, and narrative history holds together, I think, precisely because your efforts to make it all work provide such a contrast to what an incredible mess the world around you is becoming.\nRead more",

          "description": "In another lifetime, SteamWorld Dig could have easily ended up as SteamWorld Build. When Image & Form first released their 2D digging platformer back in the depths of 2013, its moreish loop of carving out rocky chasms, finding gems and treasure, then upgrading your pickaxe and burgeoning township back on the surface was instantly captivating, and its 2017 sequel continues to be one of my favourite platformers of all time. Now, a decade later, SteamWorld Build has reimagined Dig's core ideas as a handsome citybuilder, placing equal focus on managing your rustbucket town up top, while plundering its depths via an abandoned mineshaft to find treasure, resources and (most importantly) rocket parts, so you can escape your crumbling planet and find a new homestead up in the stars.\nDespite the threat of annihilation hanging over the horizon, however, SteamWorld Build is one of the most relaxed and easy-going building games I've ever played. This is a game that's more concerned with keeping your economy running like a well-oiled, uhh, machine than turning a profit, for example, and it merely dips its toe in the genre's wider, ongoing obsession with building up defences to fend off oncoming hordes of malicious town hall-eating nasties. If the scales do get thrown out of equilibrium, the worst that will happen is you get lots of angry little red robot faces appearing above your houses. You won't go bankrupt, you won't get turfed out for being incompetent, and you definitely won't see any kind of game over screen if the aforementioned nasties end up running amok in your mining levels. The stakes, then, are quite low, which is probably a good indication of whether you'll get on with SteamWorld Build, and how much you'll get out of it.\nRead more",

After over twenty years, Valve programmer Ben Burbank has fixed the bug - and explained how he did it.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Amazon doesn't specifically list this as a Black Friday deal. But it's certainly a bargain that you can take advantage of this Black Friday weekend. AMD's Ryzen 5 5600X processor is available for just either side of half-price, depending on which side of the pond you live on. Regardless, that's a big chunk off one of the best gaming CPUs around.\r\n\n\r\nWhen Katharine reviewed the 5600X back in 2020, she called it \"a stonkingly fast gaming CPU\". It's a six-core, twelve thread processor, with each of its Vermeer processors providing speedy single-core performance, making it an ideal CPU for playing both modern multithreaded games, and older single-thread titles. There are of course plenty of faster CPUs around these days, but you'll pay significantly more for those, and it's only prudent to do so if you're looking to get the highest framerates at 1080p. If you're gaming at 4k, then it's your GPU that'll be doing most of the heavy lifting, and your funds are better spent there.\r\n\n\r\nIt's also worth noting that the 5600X is highly power efficient, with a TDP of just 65 watts. This makes it both more economical and more environmentally friendly that a lot of CPUs, an important consideration if your energy bills are making you wince.\r\n \nRead more",

It's a repeated task with a touch of variation from cycle to cycle, typically associated with a character progression system of some kind. The classic one is the town-dungeon loop in an action-RPG such as Diablo 4. You sally forth into the depths with sword and shield, slaughter a bunch of blameless goblins, then orbit triumphantly back to the village square with its 24/7 forge and bustling adventurer's guild. Then off you go, once again, with a Sword +1 and a shield now bearing a Goblin Magnet. There are straightforward equivalents in multiplayer, especially in the wake of Call Of Duty 4: Modern Warfare - sign in, play a few matches, harvest some XP, unlock a new laser sight, equip it, play a few more matches with +5% to your aim.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Black Friday now provides the chance to grab one for even less, with good-quality partner cards having fallen as low as £550 in the UK and $515 in the US.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Cheap graphics cards are practically mythical these days, which is great news for gaming obsessed unicorns and centaurs, less so for us mere mortals trapped in boring old reality. But there is one last torchbearer of the budget GPU, and weirdly enough that's Intel. If you happen to live in the US, then you can get your hands on the best cheap 1080p  graphics card for a smidge more than $200 for Black Friday.\r\n\n\r\nNow I know the idea of Intel making graphics cards sounds almost as preposterous as horses with horns, but they've been at it for a while. Granted, they've not been especially good at it for most of that time. The original launch of the Arc series was pretty disappointing. But Intel have worked to imrprove the performance of their GPUs, and now the Arc A750 is an excellent 1080p offering.\r\n\n\r\nIt's also a perfectly acceptable card for those looking to make their first-steps into the world of Ray-tracing. As James notes in his review \"if you’re specifically looking to try ray tracing on the cheap, know that the Arc A750 turns the tables on the RX 6650 XT with these kinds of settings. Where the A750 produced 47fps in Hitman, the RX 6650 XT could only manage 29fps, an even steeper drop from its respective rasterised performance.\"\r\n \nRead more",

At least, that's what I think.\nI find all this nostalgia stuff interesting, mainly because it's coincided with three other events in my own personal timeline (Chapter 29 Season 11, you could say): A League Of Legends pro-player called Faker, the resurgence of a badminton star, and Fortnite's own OG event.

          "description": "Both the Steam Deck and Steam Deck OLED come bundled with cases – new and improved ones, if you get a 1TB OLED – so it wouldn’t initially make sense to invest in a third-party one. But Steam Deck accessories can take many forms, and I’ve been particularly convinced by the case style that combines a space-saving protective skin with a tougher removeable cover. Since the Dbrand Project Killswitch isn’t playing Black Friday ball, it falls to my other favourite, JSAUX’s ModCase, to provide the bargains.\r\n\n\r\nIt works thusly: instead of taking your Steam Deck in and out of a zip-up sarcophagus every time you want to play it on the move, you simply leave the handheld wrapped in the ModCase’s snug, rubbery skin, simultaneously protecting it and adding grip as you hold it. The front cover simply snaps on and off as needed. It’s a lighter, more compact alternative to a full case that, I can say from experience, absolutely shields the precious Deck effectively enough for everyday bag duty. As the name suggests, it’s modular as well, so you can mount other accessories (like kickstands, power banks and even a secondary cooling fan) to the back of the skin.\r\n\n\r\nJust want the case? No bother, that’s down from $30 from $26. There’s no UK version of the JSAUX store, unfortunately, though JSAUX ships internationally. Just click through the link below, and select which kit you'd like.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I know this is the second Crucial P5 Plus deal we’ve posted about in two days, but hey, it’s Black Friday week. ‘Tis the season. Besides, this time there’s something for us Britain-dwelling lot as well, as the 2TB P5 Plus’s price has been slashed 60% to £88 on Amazon UK – the lowest it’s ever been.\r\n\n\r\nThis is, to be clear, an almost mystifyingly small amount of money for a 2TB NVMe SSD that’s also capable of real high-end transfer speeds and game load times. Maybe not to the standards of its successor, the Crucial T500, but this is still a competitively quick-acting drive with oodles of space for game installations. The same goes for its heatsink-equipped edition, which also happens to be on sale in the US at $88, making it (currently) cheaper than the non-heatsink 2TB model. Good deals all round, then – told you ‘twas the season.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Made by solo dev Andy Brophy, Knuckle Sandwich is a turn-based RPG that's about guiding a bloke through an island paradise and eventually uncovering some weird mystery. Its main hook? Turn-based battles are filled with WarioWare-style minigames, many of which are unique to the kooky residents or rats you come up against. Unfortunately, I'd say its main hook is actually its most painful barb, and one you're barely able to extract by flicking some switches in the settings menu. A shame then, as exploring its strange world and absorbing its bonkers story beats is a wonderful thing marred by dire fights.\nRead more",

It will be a worldwide launch on PC on both Steam and the Epic Games Store. Homeworld 3 will be the first title in the Homeworld series in over two decades.\n\n\n\n\n\n“The Homeworld community has waited actual decades for this launch. We’re thrilled that their wait will finally be rewarded this March as players will be able to command the Mothership and continue their adventures. We’re grateful to BBI for their incredible work, and to the players for communicating with us and ultimately trusting us with Homeworld’s legacy. Hopefully they feel that we’ve done it proper justice.” \n- Steve Gibson, President of Gearbox Publishing\n\n\n\nImage via Gearbox Publishing\n\n\nThree special editions\n\n\nAlso revealed were four separate editions that will be available. First is the Standard Edition which comes with the base game for $59.99, as well as the Deluxe Edition which includes the base game and the Year One Pass for $79.99.\n\n\nThose interested in playing early can pick up the Fleet Command Edition which grants access to the game 72 hours early as well as the Deluxe Edition of the game and some digital goodies including a soundtrack, ship decals, engine trail color, and more. Finally, those interested in physical collector items can go for the Collector's Edition which includes everything from the Fleet Command Edition as well as a WW2-Inspired Spotted Deck, a Homeworld 3 Logo Keychain, a Lithograph, and a true-to-scale Homeworld 3 ship.\n\n\nI usually can't justify the price on physical collector's editions, but I have to admit, that ship looks pretty nifty.\n\n\nHomeworld 3 releases on PC on March 8.\n\nThe post Homeworld 3 set to release in March appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Grinding Gear Games revealed the details for the upcoming Path of Exile Affliction league. It looks like a pretty big league overall with a slew of new features, content, and updates. The Affliction League itself adds the new Virdian Wildwood, where players can work their way through a mysterious forest to hunt down the source of the Affliction.\n\n\n\n\nThe Viridian Wildwood\n\n\nPlayers will encounter Sacred Wisps that beckon them into the overgrown passageways of the Viridian WIldwood. Over time the Wisps burn away the affliction that shrouds the forest, but the Wisps only have a limited amount of power. Once you return to Wraeclast, the Wisps you saved from the affliction will inhabit random monsters, increasing their power and rewards.\n\n\nOverall this mechanic feels like a mix of Delve with Sentinel. You'll progress through the Wildwood in a Delve-like fashion, where it's sort of an infinitely generated map. Then, you will take the Wisps back with you to power up monsters for increased rewards, similar to how the Sentinels worked.\n\n\nWildwood Ascendancy Classes and return of Ultimatum mechanic\n\n\nAs you traverse the Wildwood you'll complete quests to unlock one of three new Wildwood Ascendancy classes. Your chosen ascendancy class is in addition to the regular ascendancy class, which is the first time this has happened in Path of Exile.\n\n\nAlso, the Ultimatum mechanic from the Ultimatum league is being added to the core game. The popular mechanic lets players undertake Vaal trials for the Trialmaster in exchange for rewards. If you defeat the trial, he gives you the option of doing double or nothing. It was honestly a very fun mechanic that I've missed, so I'm glad it's being added back in. Of course, the mechanic has been rebalanced as it was a pretty powerful way of obtaining rewards in its original form.\n\n\nThe Path of Exile Affliction league goes live on December 8 on PC and Mac, and on December 13 for PlayStation and Xbox.\n\nThe post Path of Exile Affliction League details revealed appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Grinding Gear Games revealed a new class that will be available in Path of Exile 2, the Mercenary. The Mercenary class features shooter-like gameplay with the ability to swap crossbows and ammo types on the fly. Alongside the class reveal, GGG also revealed that WASD movement has been added as an option to PoE2.\n\n\n\n\nThe Mercenary is a brand new class that is coming to Path of Exile 2, and does not exist in the current version of PoE. Based on the gameplay video, it looks like a pretty fun class similar to Demon Hunter from Diablo mixed with say a Gunslinger from a game like Lost Ark.\n\n\nFans had started to theorize that WASD movement was being added to the game after the previous Druid reveal video showed some gameplay that looked like WASD movement. Now that Grinding Gear Games has confirmed its existence, we know that you will be able to move in a different direction than you aim and attack which is huge for an ARPG. According to the GGG, players will be able to switch between click-to-move and WASD at any time.\n\n\nI'm excited to see what other classes and feature reveals we get as we get closer to the PoE 2 release.

          "description": "Bungie is almost ready to bring Lightfall's long-awaited Fireteam Finder feature to Destiny 2. But players can get in on the action a little early, as stress tests have begun rolling out starting today. \n\n\nPlayers logging into Season 23 on November 30 were in for a treat. An in-game message informed Guardians they could participate in the day's Fireteam Finder stress test, as Bungie previously noted in a November 22 Dev Insights post.\n\n\nToday is the only day confirmed for stress testing, but it's the first chance players have to try Fireteam Finder out. Players can jump into Fireteam Finder's first stress test between 9 AM and 5 PM PST (12 PM to 8 PM EST) on November 30.\n\n\nThe experience is limited to Raid content, and, per the in-game notice, Bungie already anticipates the test could lead to some hiccups with game performance. That said, the pop-up also provided a method for players to report any issues they came across.\n\n\nWill there be another stress test?\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nRight now, the only announced stress test is happening on November 30. That said, Bungie has already gone on to outline the path ahead. Following today's stress test, a Beta period will begin in December. \n\n\nBungie hasn't specified exact dates in December just yet, but that news will likely come after this first test concludes. Bungie did note in the Fireteam Finder Dev Insights post that the Beta's start would depend on how the stress test goes. \n\n\nFollowing the new year, Bungie estimates that Fireteam Finder will be ready for a full release in late January. This is, of course, if everything goes according to plan. And Bungie has promised to keep players updated on any timeline changes, should they develop.\n\nThe post Destiny 2 Fireteam Finder stress test is taking place today appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The turn-based tactics and occult school life of Demonschool are taking a little extra time. Today, developer Necrosoft Games announced that Demonschool is moving to a Q2 2024 release window.\n\n\nPreviously set for 2023, the studio says it's taking more time to put everything together. \"We're trying to make this thing as good as we possible can, and it needed a little more time in the oven,\" reads a statement from Necrosoft Games on Twitter. \"But it'll be worth it! Please wishlist on steeeeeeam!\"\n\n\nThe news arrives alongside a new trailer, shown at today's PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted 2023 showcase. The trailer features a good look at the mechanics of its turn-based tactics, as well as some glimpses of different characters that will be in your party.\n\n\n\n\nSchool's out for demons\n\n\nDemonschool is a pretty rad-looking tactics RPG, from the team behind games like Hyper Gunsport. It's been on our radar for some time, and made a strong impression when I got the chance to demo it at PAX East this year.\n\n\nThe story follows Faye, who's attending a university while also getting involved in a ton of occult and supernatural happenings. Between the turn-based battles, you can also wander around, pick up quests, and chat up other people.\n\n\nIt's really neat, and despite dashing my hopes for a last-second end-of-year surprise, I hope the extra time in the oven helps Demonschool shine. In an increasingly crowded 2024, this is still one of my more anticipated games. Definitely one for the indie and tactics crowds to keep an eye on.\n\n\nDemonschool is currently planned for Q2 2024 on PC via Steam.\n\nThe post Demonschool shows off more gameplay and shifts to 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

This collaboration includes seven popular indie games, including big names like Undertale and Castle Crashers.\n\n\nAlongside those two, the other games involved in this crossover are Celeste, A Hat in Time, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Untitled Goose Game, and Alien Hominid Invasion. Innersloth, the developers of Among Us, announced this massive collaboration on November 28 and it is live now, until February 28, 2024.\n\n\nThere are a total of 25 hats, 18 skins, 12 nameplates, 9 visors, and 6 pets included in this crossover. With the in-game currency—beans—players can head over to the shop and purchase a Cosmicube. The Cosmicube allows players to have access to all cosmetics from each game for a mere price of 7,000 beans. Beans are earnable through gameplay, if you're finding yourself bean-less for this new cube.\n\n\nAlongside this collaboration, Innersloth has also added in a number of different patches in order to improve Among Us. Since its release in 2018 and massive success it gained during the pandemic in 2020-2021, several updates have been released. The patch notes state that they’re falling behind because of all of the older versions of the game, so the team is removing older versions and encouraging players to update to newer versions for efficiency.\n\n\nThis collaboration will be the first update since The Fungle map was added to the game back in September of this year. The Fungle is the fifth map to be added to the game. It  features a fungus-infested jungle for crewmates and imposters to explore.\n\nThe post Among Us collaboration adds a whole slew of indie crossover cosmetics appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Cyberpunk 2077 keeps adding reasons to get lost in Night City. Now that everyone’s had time to settle in with 2.0 and Phantom Liberty, a new Update 2.1 is going to add some new gameplay elements to Cyberpunk 2077 next week. \n\n\nToday CD Projekt Red announced that the free Update 2.1 for Cyberpunk 2077 will drop on Dec. 5, to align with the release of the Ultimate Edition on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. \n\n\nAhead of the release, CDPR is hosting a REDstreams event on Twitch at 10a.m. EST on Dec. 1. The stream will feature members of the Cyberpunk 2077 team, including quest director Paweł Sasko and producer Monika Janowska, talking about new features coming to the game. In its event listing on Steam, the company wrote, “We have a few nice surprises in this patch so don’t miss it!”\n\n\nIt’s hard to say exactly what features we can expect to see in the update. Cyberpunk 2077 just recently got a slew of new content and features. The 2.0 update overhauled the game’s skill trees, changed police interactions, and added vehicle combat, and Phantom Liberty added a new district and story line. \n\n\nCDPR has previously stated those were “the last big updates” for the game, so whatever is coming probably won’t be too earth-shattering. Then again, adding onto the game is a great way to build excitement for the Ultimate Edition and future Cyberpunk projects like the live-action series and the inevitable sequel. Maybe we’ll luck out and those surprises will be bigger than we think.\n\n\nWe'll learn more when Cyberpunk 2077 Update 2.1 drops on December 5.\n\nThe post Cyberpunk 2077 is getting new gameplay elements in Update 2.1 next week appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The surprise horror hit of the earlier parts of 2023, Sons of the Forest was released to critical acclaim. While the hype died down rather quickly, the game did sell two million copies in its first 24 hours. And now, Endnight's follow-up to The Forest will be coming out of early access soon.\n\n\nIn a post on Twitter/X, the developer said that Sons of the Forest will be getting its full version 1.0 release on February 22, 2024. This will mark one year since the game came out, so the timing is pretty gnarly.\n\n\n\n\nAn update on Steam says a patch will be rolling out soon (if it hasn't been done already), and the team will \"continue to release hotfixes as needed.\" However, in the future, Endnight will be putting focus on the next stage of its survival horror sequel.\n\n\nThe studio is grateful for \"everyone who joined\" the early access\n\n\nOn top of that, the tweet goes on to say that Shawn Ashmore will be expanding his role as the voice of Timmy. Many of you will know him for his voiceover work on the likes of Quantum Break and The Dark Pictures: Man of Medan. Most recently, he played Tim Breaker in Alan Wake 2.\n\n\nQuickly gaining popularity when it was released earlier this year, Sons of the Forest retained a high position on the Steam charts, even pushing some AAA titles to one side (Lethal Company, who?). \n\n\nWith its cooperative gameplay, creepy atmosphere, and the real star of the show, Kelvin, SotF is one that many will be happy is getting its full release next year.\n\nThe post Sons of the Forest will be leaving early access in February appeared first on Destructoid.",

Now scheduled to release on January 18, 2024, New Cycle tasks players with building a new bastion for humanity on a post-apocalyptic Earth ravaged by solar flares. \n\n\n\n\nAn old new world\n\n\nPlayers take on the role of leading a small group of settlers seeking refuge after a catastrophic solar flare decimated Earth. In the dieselpunk-inspired city-builder, players will start with a small basic settlement of a few hungry workers with many needs as they build up their outpost. Morale, disease outbreaks, power losses, and resource demands are the primary challenges players will have to navigate to keep their settlement going.\n\n\nThe Early Access version of New Cycle that launches in January will feature a campaign and and sandbox gameplay mode, three different biomes, 54 buildings, 47 producible resources, three classes of society and eight different stages of development.\n\n\nNew Cycle reminds me a lot of Frostpunk with perhaps a bit of Anno 1800 mixed in which I'm all for. In the trailer it looks like the city was built around a train network which hopefully adds some interesting logistical challenges as well. \n\n\nNew Cycle launches into Early Access on Steam on January 18, 2024.\n\nThe post Survival city-builder New Cycle will release in Early Access in January appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "One of the appeals of Stardew Valley is its chill soundtrack. Accompanying players while they farm crops, talk to neighbors, and go exploring, the musical score is such an integral part of the game that a Festival of Seasons tour was announced last month. However, demand has been so high that the developer has added in more dates.\n\n\nIn a recent post on the website-formerly-known-as-Twitter, Eric \"ConcernedApe\" Barone has said the global orchestral tour has been expanded, adding new dates and locations.\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the image, we can see additional shows have been added in Toronto, Los Angeles, Melbourne, London, and more. There are also now stops in New Zealand, Paris, Berlin, Manchester, Tokyo, and plenty of others. The tour will begin in Los Angeles on February 16. Tickets go on sale on December 1.\n\n\nMight want to get yours in quick\n\n\nThe Stardew Valley tour is a celebration of the melodies that have become an iconic part of the farming simulator. The official website describes the upcoming event as an \"intimate, immersive live concert featuring fresh arrangements of the most cherished songs from the game's mesmerizing soundtrack.\"\n\n\nYou may, however, need to get a move on if you do want tickets. Some of the major cities have already sold out, which is most likely what spurred the addition of extra days in these locations.\n\n\nIn other news, there's still no word on when the next major patch for Stardew Valley is inbound. Barone has said that update 1.6 is in development, but it will only be released when it's good and ready. And rightly so. The developer is also working on a new project, which we know next to nothing about other than it's called the Haunted Chocolatier.\n\nThe post Due to popular demand, Stardew Valley orchestral tour is adding more dates appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Turnip Boy is through evading taxes; now he's taking things to a new extreme. Turnip Boy Robs a Bank was originally slated to launch in 2023, but publisher Graffiti Games announced a delay that pushes the heist back ever so slightly to January 18, 2024. \n\n\nThis time around, Turnip Boy has joined the Pickled Gang to commit a whopper of a crime. In the process of delving deeper into the titular bank, you'll steal valuables, tangle with cops, hassle hostages, and get in plenty of shootouts. You can see the particularly pungent pickle Turnip Boy has gotten into in the new trailer below. \n\n\n\n\nThe first game from developer Snoozy Kazoo, Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion, was released in April 2021, sending players out on a quest to take down a corrupt mayor. The sequel keeps the top-down perspective intact with the same delightful pixel art and even more felonies to commit. Roguelite elements are back, as well, and the many collectables available range from wearable hats to cassettes full of fresh jams. There's also the promise of the \"deeper history of Turnip Boy's world,\" so if you've been following a character called Turnip Boy for the lore, you're in luck. \n\n\nBack when Turnip Boy Robs a Bank was first being shown at events like the ID@Xbox Fall Showcase in 2022, it was planned for this year. When it drops in January it will be available on Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store. Those who want to try their hand at violent, veggie-based bank robberies will also be able to do so on Xbox Game Pass.\n\nThe post Turnip Boy Robs a Bank moves its heist to January 18, 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Yet another Resident Evil VR title will be hitting the PS VR2 soon, as RE4 Remake's VR mode arrives on December 8. It's a free update if you've already purchased the base game, but there is a free standalone demo that'll be available on launch day if you want to try it before you buy it. \n\n\nThe upcoming mode will allow you to play the remake's entire main story in VR. Several features have been included to help increase immersion. Haptic feedback has been used to allow all weapons to feel unique, and 3D audio will ensure you can never escape the horror even if you close your eyes. Commenting on the mode, director Keisuke Yamakawa states that it'll \"allow players to truly become Leon and use a variety of weapons with their own hands to take on enemies which feel like they are standing right in front of you. This unique experience is only possible in VR.\"\n\n\nImage via Capcom.\n\n\nResident Evil 4 Remake VR mode has some big shoes to fill\n\n\nResident Evil 8 VR is one of the best games on the headset, and it's guaranteed to give you plenty of scares and tons of realistic gunplay. RE4 has the potential to be the superior VR game, as it has many more combat encounters, giving you even more opportunities to try out different weapons in virtual reality. \n\n\nA shooting range will be available, which you can also try out in the demo to get a feel of all the different weapons. As has been previously noted, the Separate Ways DLC and The Mercenaries will not be available in virtual reality. \n\n\n\n\nThe mode will only be available for the PS VR2, though PC players aren't completely left in the cold, as a VR version of the original game is available on the Quest 2. RE4 Remake may be just what Sony's headset needs to boost sales during the festive season, as the VR2 has been experiencing a bit of a lull when it comes to system-seller titles. \n\nThe post Resident Evil 4 Remake VR mode launching December 8 appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, if you're sick of wheels of cheese and shiny, green apples, a couple of people have made it possible to eat something far more enjoyable.\n\n\nIf you've got that craving for some in-game pizza, hrodeberht1 and bella over on Nexus Mods may have just what you need. Their \"Necro Pizza Cyrodiil\" mod adds in a delivery service that gives you the option to order your character a hot, cheesy dish of the good stuff.\n\n\n\n\nThe above video shows how it works. Basically, it adds a pizza menu to your inventory where you get to pick from six different types of 'za (that's right, I said it). Upon placing the order, your food is sent to you by a Necromancer, where it's delivered by a skeleton who proclaims the delivery complete upon receiving it.\n\n\nShame it's not real\n\n\nThis is actually similar to another mod they did back in 2021 which allows the Dragonborn to order a pizza while roaming around in – you guessed it – Skyrim. There's also this one from a different modder that allows you to order a real pizza directly through Oblivion. So...pizza is very much something that's been missing in The Elder Scrolls this whole time.\n\n\nWhile at this point many would now consider it quite an old game, The Elder Scrolls 4 is an absolute classic in Bethesda's long-running series.\n\n\nHowever, if you want a way of playing a more up-to-date version of Oblivion, there is an unofficial remake called Skyblivion that's currently in the works. However, that's not due out until probably 2025, so you've definitely got time to grab some pizza while you wait.\n\nThe post Get a hot pizza delivered to your Oblivion character with this mod appeared first on Destructoid.",

This includes two new IPs his entertainment company is working on. \n\n\nYou shouldn't expect traditional gaming experiences from Absurd Ventures. The first IP, American Caper, focuses on two families facing a world of \"corrupt business, inept politics and bungling crime.\" We'll explore this universe through a graphic novel illustrated by comic book artist Simon Bisley. The first story arrives in 2024. \n\n\nA Better Paradise is the second IP. It's an existential suspense thriller being made with help from Q-CODE Media. Interestingly, it'll take the form of a 12-episode audio fiction series. It also arrives in 2024. \n\n\nImage via Absurd Ventures.\n\n\nDan Houser and Absurd Ventures\n\n\nHouser is a co-founder of Rockstar and has served as a writer for the Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption franchises. He left the company in 2020 before starting Absurd Ventures in 2021. We haven't seen much from the business yet and the official site doesn't offer much guidance, featuring little but some cryptic images and many-sided dice with provocative terms on them. \n\n\nThere are other projects in store from the entertainment company, as it intends to bring more stories from American Caper and A Better Paradise to a wide range of formats and platforms. Commenting on the IPs, Houser states that this is just the beginning, and the initial releases will allow them to introduce the two universes while \"working on other iterations and expansions.\"\n\n\nThough Houser may have left Rockstar, it seems crass humor and depictions of American society are a constant in everything he touches. I'm interested to see how Absurd Ventures will use varied mediums for creative storytelling. \n\nThe post Dan Houser’s Absurd Ventures  has two new IPs on the way appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "With the end of 2023 just around the corner, I feel confident in saying that Monster Hunter Now is one of my biggest surprises of the year. It’s easily Niantic’s best game since Pokemon GO, and with the game’s first major update on the horizon, it’s looking like the title will stay relevant heading into 2024.\n\n\nFor those just tuning in, Monster Hunter Now is a GPS driven augmented-reality game based on Capcom’s Monster Hunter series. While this seems like an odd pitch, it’s an entertaining concept that stays remarkably true to its source material. Though the combat naturally makes concessions to play smoothly on touch screens, Niantic’s take on the formula does appear to have resonated with players since launch.\n\n\n\nThat said, there’s certainly room for improvement here in a lot of ways, wh…",

Professor Layton and the New World of Steam hits Nintendo Switch sometime in 2025, and a you can watch as Layton and Luke work out a puzzle in the latest trailer. \n\n\n\n\nAs shown in the preview, Yo Oizumi is back leading the Japanese cast as Layton, with Mio Imada now voicing Luke Triton. Maki Horikita previously voiced Luke prior to retiring from the entertainment industry back in 2017 to focus on her family. \n\n\nThe sample brainteaser has Layton and Luke attempting to find the entrance to the workshop of a genius inventor named Eggmuffin. Frankly, not working \"Eggmuffin\" somewhere into the title is the pinnacle of burying the lede. Eggmuffin's workshop is but one quirky building amidst the wider world of Steam Bison, an American town that advances as you continue to find and solve puzzles.\n\n\nIt's been a while since Layton and Luke went on a proper adventure together. At this point Luke has made somewhat of a name for himself as a detective, while puzzle master Layton continues working as Professor of Archeology at Gressenheller University. Their latest outing is officially underway when a \"mysterious incident\" occurs in Steam Bison. I'm just tickled at the way Steam Bison works as both a really cool town name and a scrapped Mega Man X boss. \n\n\nI'm already stumped\n\n\nThis time around, puzzle design duties fall to famed Japanese puzzle design team QuizKnock. As the official Layton site notes, the team that Takuji Izawa runs specializes in combining entertainment with knowledge. As of right now they have over 2 million subscribers to their YouTube channel. We'll have to wait until 2025 to see just how thoroughly they can twist our noggins like the pliable pretzels they are. \n\nThe post Professor Layton and the New World of Steam sets 2025 release window, shows off puzzle appeared first on Destructoid.",

But you'd be crazy if you thought that would be the end of the immensely successful anime series. Pokémon Horizons is on the way to pick up the mantle, with Netflix confirming in a new trailer that it will begin airing stateside early next year. \n\n\nPokémon Horizons features a new duo of Liko and Roy, each with a starter from the Paldea region. Liko is paired with the grass-type Sprigatito, while Roy adventures around with the fire-type Fuecoco. The trailer introduces us to Liko and explains she has traveled to where it all began, the Kanto region, to enroll in the Indigo Academy. We also meet Roy, a young native of the Kanto region with a passion for becoming a Pokémon trainer. Sound familiar?\n\n\n\n\nLiko and Roy both possess artifacts that the Explorers, the Team Rocket-like group of Horizons, are seeking to take. Liko has a mysterious pendant passed down to her from her grandmother. While Roy has an ancient-looking Poké Ball that raises questions of its own.\n\n\nThe duo isn't alone though, as a group known as the Rising Volt Tacklers come to their aid in the show. The group is headlined by its own duo of Friede and Captain Pikachu, with Friede riding atop a fierce-looking Charizard of his own. \n\n\nThe series will start streaming on Netflix beginning February 23, 2024, which purposely coincides with the timing of Pokémon Day celebrations for 2024. \n\n\nPokémon Horizons isn't the only Pokémon series Netflix has coming down the pipeline though, as the fantastic-looking stop-motion animated Pokémon Concierge begins streaming on December 28. \n\nThe post Pokémon Horizons premieres on Netflix in February appeared first on Destructoid.",

Pacific Drive is a first-person adventure that unfolds in a surreal version of the Pacific Northwest. Players drive a station wagon to explore a forest filled with supernatural threats related to a government agency’s experiments gone wrong. Check out a recent story trailer below.  \n\n\nAs a run-based game, the world shifts with every trip into the forest, and the only thing keeping you alive is your trusty vehicle, which you’ll repair, reinforce, and modify using materials found while exploring the unsettling landscapes. Your car will need to stay up to snuff in order to withstand dangers such as the Zone Storm, a recurring maelstrom that obliterates everything in its path, meaning players will have to outrun it to stay alive. \nPacific Drive will be available on PlayStation 5 and PC.

I spoke to the game’s lead designer, Sofiane Saheb, and art director, Edouard Caplain, to better understand how Don’t Nod spent over three years bringing Jusant to life. \nCaplain states Jusant’s development began after Don’t Nod finished work on Life is Strange 2.

While we still don’t know his exact role or who will voice him, today’s image, posted above, provides a good look at Shadow below the neck (does he have a neck?), namely his signature air shoes. \nOff and RUNNING. #SonicMovie3\npic.twitter.com/BUIlurNIC0\nNovember 29, 2023\nProduction on Sonic the Hedgehog 3 had stalled due to the SAG-AFTRA strikes, and today’s update confirms work has resumed following the strike's suspension. Jeff Fowler remains in the director’s chair, and the returning cast includes Ben Schwartz (Sonic), Colleen O'Shaughnessey (Tails), Idris Elba (Knuckles), and James Marsden (Tom Wachowski).\nWhatever the third film entails, it has one heck of an act to follow. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was a box office smash, becoming the highest-grossing video game film of all time in the U.S. until The Super Mario Bros. Movie took that crown earlier this year.

Here’s the full blurb:\nThe store page also included a big batch of screenshots of the remaster, which can view in the gallery below.\n\nAccording to Ubisoft’s statement to IGN. , the store listing went up early due to a “technical error” \n\"As we celebrate the 20th anniversary of Beyond Good & Evil, we're excited to share that the official launch is set for early 2024, and we look forward to sharing more with you in the new year,\" Ubisoft wrote in the statement. \nBeyond Good & Evil originally launched for PlayStation 2, Xbox, PC, and GameCube in 2003. It stars Jade, a reporter and fighter who joins a resistance movement to uncover a conspiracy on an alien planet. Gameplay involves taking on enemies in martial arts melee combat while using Jade's camera to take photos of clues and evidence while solving puzzles. The cult classic received its first big remaster in 2011 in the form of an HD upgrade, while its long-lost sequel, Beyond Good and Evil 2, has seemingly been in development limbo since its formal reveal at E3 2017. \nBeyond Good & Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition is expected to launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",

The hotly anticipated sequel is coming on March 22.\nIf that date looks familiar, that’s because it was accidentally leaked not once but twice. The first instance occurred earlier this month, thanks to a PEGI rating that revealed the March 22 date. The second leak occurred just hours before today’s presentation courtesy of the game’s Steam page. But if you missed both early reveals, today is probably a nice surprise. \nA new trailer shows off more of the game’s story while also offering up new gameplay footage. The trailer showcases the new Trickster Vocation alongside new enemies, such as the towering statue, mythical beasts, and, naturally, dragons. \n\n\nDragon’s Dogma 2 is launching on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

Their latest collaborative effort introduces skins from a list of popular indie games; Undertale, Celeste, A Hat in Time, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Untitled Goose Game, Alien Hominid Invasion, and Castle Crashers. The cosmetics from all seven games will be included in a Cosmicube, which can be purchased with 7000 beans. The crossover includes 25 hats, 18 skins, 12 nameplates, 9 visors, and 6 pets. You can see a gallery of the featured skins below.\n\nThe update will also include a series of patches (which you can read right here) and will notably deprecate 2021 versions of the game, pushing players to use updated versions instead. \"We’ve been supporting a lot of older versions of the game, and as it continues to grow and get new features, it gets harder to keep up,\" the patch notes read. \"We have to remove older versions so we can focus on improving our system for everyone. Make sure you update your game and thanks for understanding!\"\nThis is the first update to Among Us since they added The Fungle, a new map that takes place in a fungus-infested jungle.

With no prior announcement or fanfare, people booting up Batman: Arkham Knight were greeted with a skin from 2022's The Batman starring Robert Pattinson. But then, as quickly as it appeared, it was removed, all without comment from the developers. While we still don't know exactly why the skin was added accidentally, we know exactly why it was created: it's a timed-exclusive suit launching with the Batman: Arkham Trilogy on Switch.\n\n\nThe collection brings Rocksteady's beloved trio of Batman games to Nintendo's hybrid console, complete with all previously released DLC. The trilogy will also include the aforementioned suit from The Batman, but it won't be limited to the Switch forever – other platforms will get access to the suit \"at a later date.\"\nGame Informer, much like the rest of the gaming community, is a big fan of the trilogy, with all three games appearing on our list of best superhero games of all time. While it's been eight years since the last game, Rocksteady has been hard at work ever since working on Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, which is set to come out on February 2, 2024. If you want to stick to the classics, Batman: Arkham Trilogy launches this Friday, December 1.",

It’s already the highest-grossing horror film of 2023, and it has now become horror production company Blumhouse’s highest-grossing film of all time.\nThe film adaptation of the popular 2014 horror game hit theaters on October 27, grossing a strong $80 million in its opening weekend, the best for any horror film this year. That’s even more impressive given that it premiered on the streaming service Peacock the same day it was released in theaters (becoming the most-watched title on Peacock during its first five days). \nFive Nights At Freddy’s has continued to gain traction over the past few weeks and has now grossed over $295 million ($136 million domestically, $160 million overseas) during the month it's been in theaters. That ranks it at the top of Blumhouse’s highest-performing films, a record previously held by M.Night Shyamalan’s Split, while also climbing over top performers such as Halloween (2018), Get Out, and Glass. \nFNAF is the BIGGEST @blumhouse film of ALL-TIME.

The film is directed by Emma Tammi and produced by Blumhouse. The film joins the ranks of other highly successful video game adaptations to release in 2023, such as the other box office juggernaut The Super Mario Bros. Movie and HBO's critically-acclaimed The Last of Us. \nFor more on Blumhouse, read about how the production company is creating a video game development and publishing studio. \nDid you watch Five Nights At Freddy’s?

          "description": "It is admittedly unfair of me, but any time a video game reveals itself as free-to-play, my interest immediately dissipates. Free-to-play games are not universally bad; plenty of brilliant design ideas, engaging stories, and fun mechanics can be found in games with no upfront admission fee. But once a game’s goal shifts from singular experience to long-term engagement, any excitement I may have folds in on itself and disappears like Pac-Man.\nIt all stems from my desire for experiences, not obligations.\nIn free-to-play and comparable models, success is marked by player engagement. The more rounds a player queues into and the longer they play, the more likely they are to engage with the monetized elements. And the best way to encourage that engagement is to incentivize players to return. Dai…",

One of the most notable features is how RGG rethought its classic brawler combat. Protagonist Kazuma Kiryu now has two fighting stances, Yakuza and Agent, the latter of which comes with a host of new secret-agent tools, such as an exploding cigarette, a Spider-Man-like cable he can use to whip enemies around, and so on. \nWe recently had a chat with RGG series chief producer Hiroyuki Sakamoto – who we spoke with last year about the future of the studio – to learn how Gaiden's new combat together, maintaining the series' identity despite how much has changed over the years, and why RGG doesn't look to…",

It's a time of year for gratitude, togetherness, repeatedly attempting to explain my job to older relatives, and most importantly, a time when a lot of people come together to eat one really big bird. But here's the thing. Why do we always eat the same kind of bird? I mean, turkey is fine and all, but why not branch out a bit? Why not chicken, or quail, or pheasant?\nAnd that got me thinking – why limit my daydreaming to real-life birds when there's so much delicious-looking poultry in video games? Sure, not every video game bird would be tasty, but it's worth assessing in case I ever get Jumanji-ed into a game one day.\nHere's my rating of video game birds based on how good they'd be for Thanksgiving dinner.\n  \nKazooie (4/10)\nfrom Banjo Kazooie\nKazooie doesn't look activel…",

On top of that, thanks to its anthology-like nature, if one Final Fantasy game doesn’t click for you, there’s a good chance another one will. As a result, ranking the Final Fantasy series can be highly contentious. Everyone has a lot of love for the first entry they played, and then there are heavy hitters like Final Fantasy X and VII, too. \nHowever, the staff here at Game Informer did the seemingly impossible: we ranked all 19 mainline numbered Final Fantasy games, including their direct sequels, from worst to best.

Alongside animation studio Illumination, it had teamed up with Red Wing Shoes to make Mario’s shoes from the movie, not as a line of shoes for sale, but rather a hyper-realistic version of the boots – odd proportions and all – to be displayed at the official Nintendo Store in New York City.\n\nThe interest in Mario’s shoes began with the movie’s first teaser poster, where the fidelity of Mario’s footwear blew fans away. People wanted to know more about them, which led Nintendo and Illumination to contact Red Wing Shoes, a Minnesota company specializing in work boots, about making some. “We got the call, and naturally, we’re like, ‘Well, Mario is the world’…",

In December, that expansion pack is expanding a little more, as Jet Force Gemini is coming to the service.\nFirst released in 1999, Jet Force Gemini is a third-person shooter developed by Rare, the studio originally known for the Banjo-Kazooie games, but most recently known for Sea of Thieves. It's set on a sci-fi alien world, where players blast through hordes of insect-like creatures.\nThe most recent way players could experience the game on modern consoles was through Rare Replay, a compilation of classic Rare games released on the Xbox One in 2015.  For a refresher on the game, check out this 60-second rundown Rare put out a few years back.\n\n\nThe Switch Online currently includes 26 other N64 games, including the recently added Excitebike 64. It also includes Game Boy Advance games, Sega Genesis games, and DLC content for popular Switch titles, like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Animal Crossing. For the full list, check out our rundown here.",

And speaking of friends, The Big Bang will support parties of up to four players. \nThe Big Bang will be available anywhere you play the most current build of Fortnite, including PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. If you won't be near a dedicated gaming device during the event, you can check it out using Xbox Cloud Gaming, Nvidia GeForce Now, and Amazon Luna services to play Fortnite via cloud streaming on your computer or mobile device. \n\"To prepare for The Big Bang, Fortnite experiences made by Epic will be disable starting 12 p.m. ET on December 2,\" Epic writes in a blog post. \"Creator-made experiences will remain enabled until downtime for Fortnite v28.00 starts at 11:30 p.m. ET.\"\nWhile waiting for The Big Bang event, read up on everything you need to know about Fortnite Chapter 4: Season OG, and then read about how Epic says it's aware it missed the mark with a recent cosmetic restriction update for Fortnite. \nAre you hopping into Fortnite's Big Bang event next month?

We loved it – find out why in Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty review here – and if you enjoyed the base game, it's not an expansion to miss. Currently, it's only available for purchase as an add-on to Cyberpunk 2077, but if you haven't yet picked it up, it might be worth waiting just a couple more weeks. That's because CDPR has revealed Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition, which includes the base game and the Phantom Liberty expansion in one single package.\nCyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on December 5, and will be released in both a digital format and physical. Check out the box art below: \nBig news… Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition arrives on December 5th in digital AND physical form for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC!\n#Cyberpunk2077 story as well as a new spy-thriller adventure in the #PhantomLiberty expansion in one package. 🔥 pic.twitter.com/IOBPCdTXFU\nNovember 21, 2023\nAll that CDPR has shared about this new edition is the tweet above so it remains to be seen if the Ultimate Edition includes any new goodies or enhancements. Given Phantom Liberty and the Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 update improved the game in big ways, reworking and revamping several of its mechanics in the process, it's unlikely the Ultimate Edition will include any changes in that vein. Only time will tell, though. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077 review and then read Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty review. After that, read about the things to remember and know before starting Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, and then check out this feature about how the team behind the expansion created its spy-thriller soundtrack.

Between letting Ichiban ride a dolphin and its Animal Crossing-style city-building mode, fans of the franchise’s goofball nature should be in for a treat, and a new batch of screenshots highlight this.\nThe images provide looks at Ichiban, Kiryu Joryu, and their returning friends, such as Nanba, Adachi, and Saeko, kicking butt in a variety of classes and looking absurd doing so.

The company pairs that with a batch of fresh screenshots and art, including the first glimpse of the Highwind airship. \nThe video sees Red XIII narrate the broad strokes of the 2020 adventure. While it doesn’t touch on the finer details and background of the characters, it provides a decent summary that's perhaps better served as a reminder for fans who played Remake rather than someone coming into Rebirth completely fresh. Unfortunately, the recap doesn’t touch on the events of the Intermission expansion that introduces Yuffie, who joins the party in Rebirth, so unfamiliar players will have to do their own homework on that. \n\n\nSquare has released some new images, including a piece of art depicting Aerith in front of the Highwind. The screenshots show off the town of Kalm, the summon Kujata, the abandoned Mythril Mine, and a few side characters. Oh, and Chadley is there too. \n\nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth launches on February 29 for PlayStation 5. You can watch us play two demos of the game in this video and read our hands-on impressions here. You can also get the answers to some of Rebirth's burning questions in this interview with Square Enix.",

Only the DOS version of the game (available on gog.com) is supported. It's a cartoon FMV game, with an inventory, in which you have to guide Lathan Kandor through a medieval world, discovering the magic spells and the items required to defeat an evil wizard. \nEscape From Hell, was developed for Electronic Arts by the game veterans Richard Seaborne and Alan Murphy and was released in 1990. You play Alan in this keyboard-only Role Playing Game and visit Hell, looking for your girlfriend who was accidentally teleported there.\nBoth games use heavily hardcoded logic which is error prone and requires a lot of testing, so we need your feedback more than ever as they are both incompletely tested. There is sadly only one known demo for Kingdom. Support for the Windows and Mac versions of Kingdom may come later! Please contact us if you have some other demos of both games.\nTo play any of these games, you will need a daily development build.
