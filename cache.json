Head out on a run, collect resources and equipment, fail at some point, use those resources to purchase upgrades, and try again and again, getting a little bit further each time until the Big Evil is defeated. In an increasingly crowded genre, Ship of Fools adheres to the formula like the suckers of a particularly strong octopus but that doesn’t mean it’s not worth a look – especially if you have someone to play co-op with.\nWaking up as a little frog guy on a beach, you soon learn that a massive storm filled to the brim with sea monsters threatens to wash everyone and everything away. Crabs and seagulls scuttle about as you leave the beach to sail off on your first voyage to tackle the source of said storm, meeting a menagerie of whimsical sea-creature-themed characters to provide help in the form of upgrades to your ship.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The reunion - previously defined as \"more than a remaster\" but not a \"complete remake\" - continues to show its impressive graphics (a step up from the PSP, I'm sure we can all agree) and there is enough nostalgia fuel here to boost even the smallest FF fan.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Valve even took down one of its own games. Released in 2004 with Steam AppID 92, Codename: Gordon is a Flash-based 2D side-scroller set in the Half-Life universe, developed by Nuclearvision and published by Valve. It was removed due to a hard-coded link to the now-defunct developer’s domain, which Valve regarded as a security risk.\nBut removed isn’t always the same as gone, and exploring Steam’s deleted items is an adventure through modern gaming history.

Ahead of that though, we’ve been introduced to another member of the game’s expanding cast of the still-living. New undead slayer Amy has been given her own teaser trailer, which you can watch here.\r\n\n \nRead more",

That game was The Walking Dead: The Final Season.\nHaving played all three previous seasons of Telltale's choose-your-own-zombie-apocalypse tearjerker (plus the 400 Days DLC and the Michonne spin-off), it's no surprise that I was incredibly invested in Clementine's story by The Final Season. I'm not a big kid person, typically, but you'd have to be beyond heartless not to love little Clem, wouldn't you? Even though, by the time TFS rolls around, she's grown into medium-sized Clem, and is a bit bloody scary to boot.\nRead more",

          "description": "Card-based strategy games seem to have really found their feet over the last 12 months. Now that we're a few years clear of Slay The Spire's chokehold over the genre, deckbuilders are starting to come thick and fast in a variety of exciting mash-ups. This year alone, I've sunk a hefty number of hours into the deckbuilding tower defence 'em up ORX, got lost in the tabletop plots of Foretales, and later this week we'll see the launch of Marvel's Midnight Suns, the new card-based strategy RPG from XCOM makers Firaxis. It's a good time to be a fan of deckbuilders, is what I'm saying, and early next year the mythological exploits of Mahokenshi will be looking to carry the baton forward into 2023. \nMade by the Paris-based Game Source Studio, this turn-based strategy battler sees you take control of four types of samurai as you seek to bring balance to a mystical realm above the clouds. Oni, goblins and other creatures from Japanese myth are your primary antagonists here, but its hexagonal islands are also stuffed full of text-based narrative events, sidequests, and treasure troves to uncover. It's a lot to take in, but the latter in particular are vital to your success. That's because every time you start a new mission in Mahokenshi, you'll be going in with a completely fresh deck - and based on an early preview build I've been playing recently, it's both an ingenious way to keep things feeling fresh, but it can also be a double-edged sword when it comes to trying out new tactics.\nRead more",

Blizzard have streamlined the early game, sure, but in doing so they've made it almost impossible to pin down my sense of place in the world. As Blizzard carves out new space for new regions and races with each and every expansion, I wonder: has the game become too big?

          "description": "Classic RPG Heroes of Might and Magic III has been transmuted into a board game, with its Kickstarter campaign currently on over 2.6 million pounds. That's 6000% over its £43,000 funding goal. You people want this. Are you sure you want this?\nThe board game is a hybrid of competitive deckbuilding and exploration, where 1-4 players travel around an overworld collecting cards to play in separate combat encounters. I do dig deckbuilding, but I suspect this might lack a little magic to anyone who isn't after a nostalgia kick.\nRead more",

          "description": "Mirrorshades cannot be the iconic eyewear of modern-day cyberpunk, I learned during a Microsoft Teams meeting. For decades, cyberpunks, hackers, and internauts have donned a cool pair of shiny shades to strike a cool pose. But mirrorshades are a serious security hazard in this age of video calls: other people can see your screen and desk reflected in the lenses. If you're mirrored up, people can gain access to private data or see if you are, for example, playing Windows Solitaire instead of paying attention to the meeting. So what's a 21st-century cyberpunk to wear? It's not like you can go without cool glasses (or stop playing Solitaire during meetings). I have ideas.\nRead more",

I remember it not only because the content is burned into my brain, but because they themed it around getting involved in cosplay, and got a bunch of cosplayers - and no disprespect to them, because they did a great job - to dress as characters from the games. And I kept thinking, like... what? Apart from Ms Drew, what characters are worth cosplaying from a series of licensed Nancy Drew puzzle games?\nAnyway it clearly didn't matter, because I saw the ads so often that I went and bought the most recent one out of curiosity. You win, Her Interactive! Midnight In Salem is a spooky mystery wherein Nancy Drew must solve an arson case (with the Hardy Boys in tow, no less) that has possible occult tie ins. It came out in 2019, and is Nancy Drew #33. 33 Nancy Drew games! Imagine. Also, I cannot download it and I have spent over two weeks trying.\nRead more",

Chained Echoes, the retro Japanese-inspired RPG he's been working on as a solo dev for the last seven years, is almost ready to release on Steam, but he tells me there's \"still so many little and not so little things to do\" before the big day hits on December 8th. \"[I] still need to patch the languages into the console versions. Still need to pass one submission,\" he says over email. \"I can’t really think about the release itself, just about the things I need to finish till then.\"\nBut he also says he's \"happy at the same time\". After a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2019, Chained Echoes has been gradually gathering steam ever since - and judging by the 90-minute demo I was able to play recently, it's clear Linda's got something really quite special here. Not only do its 16-bit-style visuals look absolutely stunning, but its turn-based combat's also unlike anything else I've seen. You've still got your classic list of commands to pick from, but as battles progress you'll need to maintain a kind of flow state known as Overdrive to deal the optimum amount of damage. Overextend your party's abilities and you'll leave yourself vulnerable to critical hits from your enemies, but go too slow and you'll need to build your Overdrive bar back up to regain those lost stat buffs. It's a fascinating system, and was borne out of Linda's desire to \"build a bridge between the worlds\" of considered, turn-based tactical combat and the fast-paced action of real-time.\nRead more",

There are other things you can do, like ducking, and jumping, and throwing your sword. But so many fights come down to a tense little close-range shuffle where each player stands just out of range of the other's blade, moving their sword higher and lower in a seconds-long game of chicken.\nOh look, now I'm holding rock! Can you switch to paper fast enough? Nope, now I'm holding scissors! Oh, and now it's paper! Now rock again! Now paper! What will you do?... Oh. You can just jump over me and keep running.

          "description": "During my journey into the depths of TikTok's dabloon craze, I’ve joined a cult who worship the high priestess Dabloonis, have sailed across the high seas on a pirate ship called The Dabloonian, and accidentally taken part in a dabloon heist that's now made me a wanted fugitive by the dabloon police. It's been a strange couple of hours.\nDabloontok is TikTok’s newest trend, and is probably best described as a chaotic player-generated RPG where users collect an imaginary currency called \"dabloons\" cashed out by awkwardly photoshopped black cats (usually) in fantasy settings. These cats will either gift you dabloons, steal your dabloons, or tell you what you can do with your dabloons. It's as simple as that, and so far there more than 520 million views on the dabloons hashtag. It’s kinda wild.\nRead more",

It's a medieval murder mystery with monks and manuscripts and other m things - including the protagonist, who is an artist called Andreas Maler. It's inspired by The Name Of The Rose, a murder mystery similarly focused on a medieval scriptorium in a monastary (and notable for being adapted into a film where Sean Connery is a detective monk aided by a tiny baby Christian Slater).\nIn the ol' days books, were copied by monks onto parchment made of animal skin. Most people weren't educated enough to read, in case poor people got radical ideas like maybe they should get some rights, and controlling the flow and spread of information was one of the things that made the church as powerful as it was. Pentiment takes place just as printing presses are becoming popular, which makes access to knowledge more readily available. Part of how the game conveys this is through the dialogue - not the stuff people are saying, although that helps, but what their speech bubbles looks like when they talk. You've probably already heard this, but I want to show you in a bit more detail.\nRead more",

          "description": "Sometimes you just gotta play the hits, which Amazon are very much doing with their early Black Friday keyboard deals. The Logitech G915 Lightspeed Wireless is an enduringly comfortable, responsive, and strikingly slim gaming keyboard that’s a regular feature of sales events like Black Friday and Prime Day, and once again it’s on sale now – both in the UK and in the US.\nThis time, it’s also being joined by its tenkeyless little brother, the G915 TKL Lightspeed Wireless. This shares the same finely-crafted, all-mechanical build and solid wireless connectivity of the full-size model, merely cutting the number pad in pursuit of a smaller desk footprint and a lower price.\n\n Read more",

The ad for their lead engineer specifically refers to the game as a third-person action RPG. \r\n\r\nThe new hires will join former Overwatch executive producer Chacko Sonny, team lead at the newly formed Netflix Games Studio.

That’s hundreds upon hundreds of pounds less than the average RTX 3080 laptop, even during the current season of early Black Friday offers. \r\n\n\r\nUntil Nvidia get around to making a mobile version of the RTX 4080, this is the second-most powerful RTX laptop GPU you can get, so it’s much more commonly found inside £2000-plus models. Suffice to say, chances to secure yourself such a graphics chip for £1200 are very rare indeed. And it’s not like the other components are guff: the AMD Ryzen 7 5800H is a perfectly adequate octa-core CPU, and the Nitro 5 ignores slow mechanical storage to equip itself with a 1TB SSD. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I've known for a long time that becoming an astronaut was never going to be my life's calling. My eyesight's terrible, for one, and I guarantee I'd be vomming all over the walls if I was ever put inside one of those whirly burly machines to simulate the experience of launching into space. Indeed, if the two hours I spent playing Deliver Us Mars last week were anything to go by, I don't think I'd even make it through the doors at NASA. They'd take one look at me and turn me away on the spot, because man alive, even my fingers were aching after tackling a couple of different sections from early in the game's story.\nThere's a good reason for this, though, and it's one that actually enhanced my experience of the game as opposed to detracting from it. You see, while heroine Kathy might look like an auto-climbing Lara Croft-stronaut, with her pair of pickaxes dangling off her suit, in practice she's anything but. In fact, when she's climbing up and down walls, Kathy has more in common with Grow Home's little BUD bot than anyone else - albeit with a significantly higher polygon count. As she carries out her quest to look for tech to save Earth from an impending climate crisis, players manually control her climbing movements with pushes and squeezes of their right and left mouse buttons, plotting a course through the game's gnarled mess of girders and metallic bulkheads one axe stab at a time. It's a slow, but wonderfully tactile process, and it all adds up to launch Deliver Us Mars straight out of the trad, third-person action canon, and into the altogether starrier realms of platforming pioneers. \nRead more",

It was undoubtedly produced by AI to feed the social media machine, yet the cold, hard numbers transported me back to the warm embrace of Verdansk, a battle royale map my mates and escaped to almost every evening as the pandemic raged. The silly 120 second video shot me right in the feelings.\nMy history with the first game means that I enter Warzone 2 with an embarrassing tangle of emotional baggage and personal investment. It has a lot to live up to. And for the most part, it has been a joy to drop in again. Launch woes aside, the sequel iterates on the first in a way that feels like it'll last in the long run and confirms that there's still no battle royale that does it quite like Warzone.\nRead more",

          "description": "Ubisoft and the multiverse of madness\nIn Far Cry 6, protagonist Dani Rojas had to contend with an oppressive regime. But in the new DLC, Far Cry 6: Lost Between Worlds, the threats a little more otherworldly.\nUbisoft revealed the trailer for Lost Between Worlds today, a Far Cry 6 story DLC that's arriving on December 6. It's coming to PC, Xbox, and PlayStation for $19.99. It's also part of the Upgrade Pass.\nFrom the looks of it, the new DLC sends Dani into an alternate reality or dimension of some kind. Crystalline enemies await, alongside dangerous hazards and even crocodiles. You really just can't escape the crocodiles in Far Cry.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRMbuyJyUzU\nA mysterious voice, emitting from an orb of light, directs Dani on a path to put everything back to normal for the both of them. But, of course, the light may have its own aims and goals.\nThis fractured version of Yara will have 15 trials, with different ways of tackling them. Along the way, players can pick up new weapons and tools, and eventually acquire some powerful gear to bring back to the real Yara.\nBack to Yara\nFar Cry 6 has also been getting some further updates with Title Update 6. This adds New Game+, letting you bring any endgame equipment and weapons through to a new playthrough. It also adds a Completionist Aid feature, which should help with finding the many, many collectibles around Yara.\nThe game also has a free trial, so you can test it out and see if you like playing through Dani's explosive adventure across Yara.\nThe post Far Cry 6 goes science fiction in Lost Between Worlds DLC next week appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "But some players are disappointed at stripped-down status\nActivision has relaunched the original edition of Call of Duty Warzone, the battle royale variant of its best-selling military franchise. The publisher had previously removed the title in order to spotlight its successor, Warzone 2.0, but has now reopened servers for the original bullet-pumping multiplayer title.\nRemonikered \"Warzone Caldera\", the original Warzone is now available as a separate entity, featuring only two modes — Quads and Solos — and only one map — the titular Caldera. Additionally, Warzone Caldera has to be downloaded as a separate platform, adding a lot of sweaty weight to Call of Duty's already mammoth HDD footprint. For these reasons listed and others, die-hard Warzone 1.0 fans are disappointed in the title's \"stripped down\" reappearance.\nThis is an unfortunate inevitability with multiplayer-only titles, and battle royale releases especially. It's vitally important to an online game's lifespan that focus is placed on everyone \"moving forward\", as it were, ultimately ostracizing the players that may have been quite happy with the way things already are. It probably wouldn't take all that much time and effort for Activision to restore Warzone Caldera to its original status, but this, obviously, is unlikely to happen.\nActivision and developers Raven Software and Infinity Ward will be focusing their time, money, and resources on the sequel, putting all of their eggs snugly into the Warzone 2.0 basket. The publisher and its subsidiaries will be doing all it can to ensure that Warzone's huge global player base does the very same.\nCall of Duty: Warzone 2.0 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post Original Call of Duty Warzone relaunched as Warzone Caldera appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Fly me to the moon\nA new month is almost upon us, and the PlayStation Plus games for December have leaked just before the date ticked over.\nDealabs, which has leaked the list of PS Plus games before, has the alleged games for this coming month. The Mass Effect Legendary Edition is reportedly due up, as is Biomutant and Divine Knockout, or DKO.\nThese games will reportedly be headed to PlayStation Plus' Essential tier, the base level of PS Plus in Sony's tiered structure.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8i53TtQ6IQ\nThe Mass Effect Legendary Edition needs little introduction. It's a remastered collection of the Mass Effect trilogy, putting the whole thing in one tidy, neat package. And frankly, if it's going up on PS Plus, there's even fewer excuses to not dip into this and try it. There's not many other RPGs out there that do what this trilogy did.\nBiomutant is the rodent post-apocalyptic action game from Experiment 101 and THQ Nordic. It dropped last May and seemed like it got an okay reception. If you like the idea of playing as woodland critters with gritty looks and weapons, this might be up your alley.\nAs for Divine Knockout, that's a new multiplayer game from Red Beard Games and Hi-Rez Studios. According to a Steam page listing, it's a third-person platform fighter that seems to take a more 3D approach to its smashing and bashing.\nLast chance for last month's games\nKeep in mind that the changing of the calendar month also means November's games are rotating out. As the December PlayStation Plus games hit, the November ones depart. So if you've yet to pick them up, sooner's better than later.\nFor November 2022, the list included Nioh 2, Heavenly Bodies, and the LEGO Harry Potter Collection. Those will rotate out sometime in December, so be sure to nab them if you want them.\nThe post December PlayStation Plus Essential games have leaked appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Because y'all love IPs and Content\nIn a quarterly earnings call held yesterday, Polish studio CD Projekt RED noted that it would be looking into more opportunities \"in the transmedia space\" following the smash success of Netflix anime series Cyberpunk: Edgerunners — an animated adaptation of the developer's hi-tech RPG Cyberpunk 2077.\nWhile CDPR has already noted that it does not have plans to produce a second season of the flashy 'n' savvy series, the studio has been made very aware of the lucrative and creative potential of such projects, and, as reported by VGC, has made clear that it will be looking into similar adaptations in the future — be it through film, animation, and/or streaming series.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ax5YUmkWf_Y\nPremiering in September of this year, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners offered up 10 episodes of rebellious, electric action, winning over fans with its flashy visuals, futuristic vistas, and gun-toting breakout star, Rebecca. The success of Edgerunners is hardly teaching CDPR any new lessons, given the global praise heaped upon The Witcher — another Netflix production that resides within CDPR's big book of brands.\nThe success of Cyberpunk: Edgerunners is another example of modern media's creeping realization that adaptation and crossover is a far easier route to the Big Bucks than creating a fresh universe from scratch. You already have the world and its \"rules\" laid out for you, and you even a potential crossover audience from the get-go. Fans of a brand in one form of media are often given to swiftly switching over to another, and vice versa.

          "description": "DC Extended Universe to cover all mediums\nJames Gunn, director of big-screen comic-book epics such as Guardians of the Galaxy and The Suicide Squad, has suggested that upcoming video games set within the DC Comics universe are to be included in the overall lore of the DC Universe at large.\nGunn, who was recently assigned the role of co-chairman and co-CEO of DC Studios, made the comments in a recent Twitter exchange, confirming plans to have DC Studios' future projects — be they cinematic, animated, televisual, or in the medium of gaming — essentially inhabit the same universe. This broadens the scope for character arcs far beyond that of almost any \"cinematic universe\" to date.\nWhile the proof of the pudding will be in the eating, it's difficult not to see the potential for chaos in these plans. The idea that, for example, Rocksteady's oft-delayed title Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League might lay arcs for characters in upcoming films, or TV shows, (or vice versa). Gunn's comments also come after the initial efforts for a fully connected DC extended universe have essentially resulted in a plethora of mediocre to terrible movies — with the better efforts, such as Matt Reeves' The Batman, being distinctly disconnected from DC Comics cinematic canon at large.\nDC Comics has struggled in its efforts to present a coherent and reliable connected universe when it was only focused on one arcing medium, (cinema), the idea of trying to build a similar project via multiple mediums seems to be something of a herculean task. Still, the new co-CEO clearly sees potential in the concept, so we'll just have to wait and see what the future brings for Batman, Joker, Aquaman, and Wonder Woman.\nBut not Batgirl. Apparently.\nSuicide Squad: Kill the Justice League launches in 2023 on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.\nThe post James Gunn: DC Comics video games to become part of DC extended universe appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Pokémon mods are rolling in\nDespite some glaring technical issues, the newest mainline games in the Pokémon series, Scarlet & Violet, have been smash hits. It's likely that Game Freak will do their best to patch the most glaring of glitches out as soon as they can, but that doesn't guarantee that the game's abysmal performance slow-downs will necessarily be fixed. Thankfully, fans are stepping in with mods to make for a smoother Pokémon experience, even though Nintendo is particularly tough on those who modify their games. There are some brave soldiers out there doing Arceus' work to help give us a better gaming experience even at the risk of being struck down by the powers that be, and we have to commend them for that.\nThe modder in question is called \"theboy181,\" and they're creating a mod that allows players to take on the games at a silky smooth 60fps, which is a welcome change for those who have already given Scarlet & Violet a whirl. While the mod is not yet publicly available, and we don't have any information on when to expect the mod's release, theboy181 has posted some proof-of-concept photos to Twitter, and it looks absolutely amazing.\nhttps://twitter.com/theboy181/status/1596759874654048263\nIf you want to give the mod a spin when it eventually comes out, you'll likely have to play it on a PC emulator rather than a Nintendo Switch, as that's how it's being developed in the first place. It's not impossible that theboy181, or another modder, could make it playable on a jailbroken console, and if you're already looking to mod a Nintendo title, I'd bet you're cool with hacking a Switch anyway.\nI find it pretty amazing that players have figured out how to modify games so seamlessly, and while I would have preferred Nintendo release a polished, bug-free title in the first place, knowing that the modding community has our backs makes me feel a bit better about things.\nThe post This Pokémon Scarlet & Violet fan mod will let you run the game in 60fps appeared first on Destructoid.",

Movie second trailer tomorrow, November 29.\nThe Direct, as Nintendo is dubbing it, will air live at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET. There's no estimation on how long this one will be, though given its prior Direct, this movie teaser will likely be on the shorter side.\nhttps://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1597350002028064768/\nAs Nintendo states in its tweet, no game information will be included in this Nintendo Direct.

And also, hopefully, more selfie cam talking heads with the cast.\nMario goes to the movies\nIn our first trailer for the new Mario movie in September, we got a pretty good look and feel for what's in store. It seems like a Mario isekai, with the plumber waking up in the Mushroom Kingdom and setting off for adventure.\nMeanwhile, Jack Black's Bowser absolutely stole the show. Both his pre-trailer guest spot and his in-trailer performance as the King of the Koopas was excellent.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPpazvJrHm0\nThere are still some principal performances we're waiting on, though. No sign of Peach or Donkey Kong yet, and we got maybe a smidgeon of Charlie Day's Luigi at the end there.\nConsidering the teaser image for the new Direct features the stained-glass art of Peach's castle, we'll hopefully get more of the cast this time around.\nThe stream goes live at 2 p.m. PT over here on Nintendo's YouTube.

Upcoming Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name will have a cabaret mini-game.\nThe Like a Dragon, née Yakuza, series has had a wealth of minigames over the years. But few are as well-remembered as the cabaret ones. First making an appearance in Yakuza 0 and then again in Kiwami 2, these sections have you manage a club of hostesses.\nUnlocking new hostesses through quests and scouting, while also competing with other clubs, became quite an engrossing side activity. And now it looks like the festivities return for Like a Dragon Gaiden.\nhttps://twitter.com/RGGStudio/status/1597301578675130368\nLike a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name follows longtime series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu, after the events of Yakuza 6. The Dragon of Dojima stepped down from the spotlight in the sixth entry as Ichiban Kasuga took over in Yakuza: Like a Dragon. (Kiryu did make an appearance in that entry, but didn't star.)\nGaiden looks to bridge the gap a bit, as Like a Dragon 8 will have both Ichiban and Kiryu in the lead. And from the looks of it, Kiryu has been going through some stuff.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxkn-dcy01k\nA year of dragons\nIt looks like we've got a decent amount of RGG content on its way, as the studio is also due to release Like a Dragon: Ishin next February. With Gaiden also set for 2023 and Like a Dragon 8 aiming for 2024, there's a lot of Kiryu in store for the next year or so.\nAll that said, I'm happy to see the cabaret game returning. It's fondly remembered for a reason, and will hopefully add an extra bit of mini-game oomph to Gaiden. As much as I liked holding meetings in Like a Dragon, I'm ready to manage the club again.\nThe post Like a Dragon Gaiden will have a cabaret mini-game appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Comic book carnage from Firaxis\nPublisher 2K Games and developer Firaxis have released a gameplay overview trailer for its upcoming release, Marvel's Midnight Suns. The comic-book strategy adventure will launch next week on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series, with PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch ports to follow at a later date.\nIn the video, we see the turn-based strategy that Firaxis has finally honed in games such as the acclaimed XCOM series applied to familiar characters from Marvel's huge universe of superheroes, (and villains). Under the guidance of custom protagonist \"The Hunter\", players will utilize the skills of names such as Dr. Stange, Wolverine, Iron Man, Blade, Captain Marvel, Spider-Man, and The Scarlet Witch to lead an attack on the dark armies of Lillith, Mother of Demons.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7Icc7o0ex4&t\nMuch like its XCOM brethren, Midnight Suns will offer up a story-based campaign, in which they will lead a growing team of heroes into the battlefield, utilizing the offensive and defensive capabilities of the crew to ensure a glowing victory in battle. New heroes and abilities will be forged and unlocked as the story progresses, with powerful, scene-clearing Hero Moves being offered to characters who are on a particular roll in the ongoing war against evil.\nThere's no denying that the XCOM titles handle strategic action very well, and this marriage of Firaxis' pedigree with the Marvel universe's cast of exciting characters could result in a fine hour-eater for those long, cold winter evenings. Having already faced a one-year delay, comic book fans need only wait one more week before they get the opportunity to take their favorite characters into battle.\nNot my favorites, of course.

The tidbit was dropped in an interview rolled out this past weekend to subscribers of \"The Secret Onion Cellar\" newsletter.\nLittle has been revealed about the new release since its initial announcement back in 2020. We do know that the mysterious release is a sandbox RPG that will no doubt feature the stylized visuals and thought-provoking narratives synonymous with Onion Games hits such as 1997's Moon: Remix RPG Adventure and 2018's mournful shmup Black Bird. Also, according to Kimura, \"children\" will form the central theme of the new adventure.\n\nIn an additional letter to the fans, as printed by Gematsu. Kimura candidly speaks of the stress and turbulence of being an indie studio, detailing some of the psychological and physical pressures of working under budget and within limitations, while being completely unsure as to whether your release will ultimately hit it big on release. Kimura notes that it is also a very expensive process, that can take its toll on the expenses you have aside for basic living and other day-to-day costs.\n\"Indie game developers are basically bizarre creatures that are constantly running, laughing, and playing chess, all while bleeding profusely,\" concludes Kimura, in a typically colorful and visceral statement, before signing off delightfully as \"Your Indie Game Making Uncle\".\nBlack Bird is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch, and is well worth your time.\nOnion Games' new sandbox RPG due out in 2023 [Gematsu]\nThe post Onion Games’ untitled sandbox RPG will launch in 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Specially decorated \"Pocky K.O.\" boxes will be distributed throughout Japan from tomorrow, November 29, with images of the original World Warriors emblazoned on the packaging. Inside, a special code will afford access to Street Fighter II: Pocky Edition, which can be played on mobile platforms and web browsers.\n\nWhat this boils down to is a typically regular edition of the grandfather of fighting games, imbued with extra Pocky advertising. For example, characters will hold Pocky sticks/boxes in their hands during victory poses. As a weird touch, players can achieve a special \"Pocky K.O.\" when the health bar hits the correct chocolate-to-biscuit ratio on an average Pocky stick. Baffling. They could have at least applied Rainbow Edition physics.\nPocky? Partial Credit!\nOf course, I'm not really angry about it. It's darn tragic, mind, but it's harmless fun. It's not even the first time that Pocky and Street Fighter have collaborated. Who remembers Street Fighter V's relatively pointless \"Pocky K.O. Challenge\" — a tournament that featured the same \"sweet spot\" qualifications for landing that elusive Pocky K.O.? Glico has also noted that it plans to build a Street Fighter II: Pocky Edition cabinet to take to trade events. A frightening prospect.

The esoteric game director responded to a tweet about the rumor with little more than a series of question marks — suggesting that if Grasshopper Manufacture were stepping into the iconic world of H.R. Giger's extraterrestrial beings, then it was news to him.\nhttps://twitter.com/suda_51/status/1596118774901805056?s=20&t=CVRjWqcGKVLdtSteYdGYbA\nOf course, the internet being the internet, this has not stopped die-hard fans from thinking that perhaps Suda is merely keeping the project under wraps, and that his tweet is a smoke screen to keep people guessing. Quite honestly, Grasshopper Manufacture seems a baffling choice of developer for 20th Century Fox to contact with an eye to adapting the famous film franchise, one would assume that it would choose a studio with a less stylistic and bespoke approach to game design.\nEither way, you can't blame the fans for being excited. Despite being almost custom designed for gaming, the Alien franchise has had a seriously hit-and-miss relationship with the medium over the decades — with perhaps its best offering being 2014's Alien Isolation. It would be pretty fascinating to see what Suda and his crew could make of the franchise's frightening and violent xenomorphic universe, but it seems that this particular rumor can be laid to rest.\nThe post Suda51 seemingly shuts down Grasshopper Manufacture ‘Alien’ rumor appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Stay close\nAfter drudging through internet forum rumors and all sorts of wacky tips that didn't pan out: I finally found the answer to whether or not Pokemon Scarlet and Violet co-op can provide access to exclusives. Well, through experience, I'm here to tell you that it can!\nJust know there is a caveat.\n\nTo be clear, you can catch exclusive Pokemon in co-op from either game that the co-op session has access to, but everything is proximity-based. Spawns will happen for either version (regardless of the host) so long as players are close to each other. Meaning, you can't just go off into another part of the game world and expect to farm all of the exclusives in minutes.\nAs you can see in the above image, I captured Gulpin (a Violet exclusive) in south province area three while in my wife's Violet game, as a Scarlet player (you can also view the proximity in which we were able to get this Gulpin to spawn in the header image). It's also important to note that if your partner is really early in the story, they may not have access to mount-based movement that can get them to some of the later/endgame zones: or may not even have access to some locations entirely. So you are at the mercy of either player's progression that regard.\nWith all that in mind, you can use this trick to your advantage to track down Pokemon as a unit in a really cool, organic way. The other player can potentially look up Pokemon locations on their Pokedex, then you can ride out together and look for them, and capture them together.\nI spent part of the weekend doing just that, and it was a blast!\nThe post PSA: You can collect exclusive Pokemon in Scarlet and Violet co-op, but it’s proximity based appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Raceway to Recovery\nSonic Team has released that first major patch for its recent release Sonic Frontiers — Rolling out on PlayStation now, Version 110 addresses numerous issues with the so-so adventure. Similar patches for other console and PC platforms are set to follow in the near future.\nThe patch notes are, oddly, only available via the Japanese Sonic Frontiers Twitter. But, thanks to a translation by UpdateCrazy, we know that Version 110 includes fixes for a variety of in-game problems, including UI and map optimization, fixes to audio issues, performance improvements, and fixes for numerous fatal crashes. The new update also cleans out a bug that would cause the Chronos Island boss to randomly disappear upon retry.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nfr4kK8phZ4\nSonic Frontiers launched on November 8 to a mish-mash of reviews and divisive fan praise. While some found the new adventure an interesting and unique new take on the Sonic the Hedgehog universe, others were ostracized by repetitive gameplay and a dull, somewhat miserable environment. Much of the fanbase sees Sonic Frontiers as a positive step for the dice-roll franchise, however, and hopes that it represents a new dawn for a series that has had its fair share of terrible releases.\nThere is still work to be done to bring Sonic Frontiers fully up to speed, (pun fully intended), and Sonic Team lead Morio Kishimoto has raised a few eyebrows with his comments that he sees the game's grand worldwide launch akin to a \"global playtest\". Despite this, Kishimoto points to the new title as a landmark moment, reinventing the long-running franchise for a brighter future.\nSonic Frontiers is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.\nThe post Sonic Frontiers patch address issues with map, audio, crashes and more appeared first on Destructoid.",

Discovery revealed last month that it had hired Peter Safran and Marvel Studios alum and director James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy, The Suicide Squad, Peacemaker) to lead as co-CEOs of DC Studios, as reported by Variety. Since then, Gunn has been fielding questions about DC Studios, the DCU's future, and what his plans are as a new lead within DC's entertainment output. \nWhen asked on Twitter yesterday if he and Safran are \"planning to give more DC characters TV shows that'll add to the story for the DCEU,\" Gunn responded, \"Yes, most definitely, the DCU will be connected across film and TV (and animation).\" In a follow-up tweet, another user asked is there are plans to connect games to this larger DCU canon as well, to which Gunn simply responded, \"Yes.\" \nYes.\nNovember 27, 2022\nIt's an interesting response and idea, especially given that it seems clear Warner Bros. Discovery wants its DCU to become something more akin to Marvel Studios' MCU. However, MCU plans don't include video games because Marvel's video game efforts through partners such as Insomniac Games (Marvel's Spider-Man), Crystal Dynamics (Marvel's Avengers), and others do not connect in any way.\nIn fact, Marvel Games vice president and creative director Bill Roseman said back in September that it's important that each studios' Marvel game is not connected to the rest as it allows for narrative freedom said studio might not get otherwise.\nThis is one area DC could differ greatly from Marvel and who knows, perhaps it's the creative edge DC needs to catch up to the MCU. Only time will tell. \nIn the meantime, check out our thoughts on the latest DC game in Game Informer's Gotham Knights review.

The nine realms are dark and dangerous, but through all of that shines a beam of unexpected light, and I am not talking about Brok, the dwarf who seems incapable of finishing a sentence without including some kind of vulgarity before meeting the period at the end. I am talking about Ratatoskr, the eyepatch-wearing squirrel who watches over Yggdrasil, the world tree that holds the realms in place.\nRatatoskr technically appeared in God of War (2018), but he was less of a character and more of an ability.

According to designer and creative director Ben Esposito, the earliest iteration was in March 2019, more than three years before its release in June 2022. In that time, there were more than 50 different iterations. Sometimes changes were small. Other times they fundamentally altered the level. Every designer who worked on the game has touched Smackdown in some form. Nevertheless, load into it now; chances are all that labor is invisible to you. Before sitting down to write, I beat it in just 11 seconds.\nNeon White is a game built around speedrunning. Levels are short. If you’re playing as intended, you hardly notice your surroundings before moving on. But the only way that works effectively is if levels are meticulously designed to facilitate that movement; they have to be made so that it feels natural for the player to fly through them. Making a level you barely think twice about takes a lot of effort. Read more...",

Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was showered with praise upon release in 1992 and surprisingly, that sterling reputation hasn't faded decades later. We asked the people behind the game's success to share how Sonic's second outing became one of Sega's driving forces in its fight against Nintendo.\nComing off of the massive success of the Japan-developed Sonic the Hedgehog, Sega relocated development efforts for the sequel to the newly founded Sega Technical Institute in the U.S. Sega tapped Mark Cerny to lead the STI, who has since gone on to help create other mascots like Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon.

And I’m here, of all things, to see a video game.\nBut first, I must explore a place on the other side of the world I hadn’t even heard of a month earlier – a narrow island called Lifou, part of a French territory known as New Caledonia, which sits some 750 miles east of Australia. I’m meeting a small team of game developers who have chosen to find inspiration for their new game in this remote locale.

The number, which includes physical and downloadable copies as reported by Nintendo, already places Pokémon Scarlet and Violet in the top 15 best-selling Nintendo Switch titles of all time. In this three-day number, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet have already outpaced lifetime sales of games such as Splatoon 3, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, Nintendo Switch Sports, and Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury.\nThe current overall best-selling Nintendo Switch title is Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, which has sold just over 48 million units as of the end of September. As of this writing, the Pokémon franchise occupies 3 of the top 10 slots of lifetime Nintendo Switch software sales, with Let's Go, Pikachu and Eevee at number 10, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl at number 8, and Sword and Shield at number 5. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet need to sell just under 5 million more combined copies to crack into the top 10. To date, the Nintendo Switch has sold over 114 million units.\nPokémon Scarlet and Violet represent the first time players are able to explore a fully open-world environment in a mainline Pokémon RPG. While critics praised various aspects of the newest games in the series, the technical performance has been universally panned. However, despite those concerns, Game Freak, The Pokémon Company, and Nintendo clearly have another massive hit on their hands. You can read our full review of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet here.",

Space Invaders was an early cultural phenomenon that was rumored to have inhaled so many coins that it created supply issues for the currency in Japan. Halo, one of the biggest video game franchises ever created, is about an ongoing war with aliens. We enjoy fighting aliens in video games because it’s easy to make creatures from another planet the enemy and they can look like anything.\nThe smaller, more personal alien invasion story, however, is a specific sub-genre of extra-terrestrial narrative we don’t often see in video games.

          "description": "A new Fire Emblem Engage trailer has detailed how players can summon \"Emblems,\" characters from past Fire Emblem games. Units will be able to equip Engage Rings to gain the ability to gain the power of a hero, like Marth or Byleth. When units equip the rings, they become synced with the Emblems, boosting their stats and giving them access to new, Emblem-specific skills. Based on the demonstration in the trailer, this will make a massive difference in a unit’s power level.\n\n\nUnits can also “Engage” with the Emblems, fusing into a new form even more powerful than a synced form. In addition to gaining access to special weapons, the player can use Engage Skills: unique abilities that harken back to the Emblems’ original games. For example, since Byleth was a teacher in Fire Emblem: Three Houses, one of his abilities allows him to teach nearby units, boosting their stats. Meanwhile, Corrin can use an ability called Dragon Vein, which alters the terrain in the same way she was able to in Fire Emblem Fates.\nIn total, the trailer showed off six Emblems: Marth (Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon), Sigurd (Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War), Celica (Fire Emblem Gaiden/Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia), Lyn (Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade), Corrin (Fire Emblem Fates), and Byleth (Fire Emblem: Three Houses). Additionally, a trailer from last week features glimpses of Ike and Lucina, and then mentions 12 rings, implying that Engage will feature more Emblems at launch.\nFire Emblem Engage was announced at a Nintendo Direct back in September. The initial trailer revealed that Alear, the game’s protagonist, is the Divine Dragon, a descendant of a royal family of Dragons that defeated the Fell Dragon many years ago. We’ll know the full story and more when the game launches on January 20, 2023.",

Multiplayer is a must, but something competitive might not be the way to go – there are only so many games of Mario Party and Monopoly a group of people can play together before they want to rip each others' heads off.\nIn this case, co-op is the way to go: specifically, something everyone can play in the same room on the same TV.

          "description": "Legendary Sonic designer and Balan Wonderworld director Yuji Naka has been arrested in Tokyo in connection to an insider trading investigation involving the reveal of a Dragon Quest game. \nAccording to the Japanese news outlet FNN, the last 24 hours saw ex-Square Enix employee Taisuke Sazaki and his friend Fumiaki Suzuki arrested on suspicion for insider trading. In 2020, developer Aiming had been set to announce its mobile game Dragon Quest Tact, and Sazaki and Suzuki are alleged to have known details about the game before it was publicly revealed. The pair reportedly purchased a combined 162,000 shares of Aiming for roughly 47.2 million yen (or over $335,000) in advance with the intent of profiting on a potentially higher stock price stemming from Tact’s announcement. \nYuji Naka is now suspected of being involved in this scandal as well. He is accused of purchasing 10,000 shares worth 2.8 million yen (roughly $20,000) in Aiming for the same purpose of profiting from Tact’s reveal. Naka was apprehended by Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, and the investigation is ongoing. It’s currently unknown if the suspects still own their shares or if they already sold them.  \nThis is the second major controversy Naka has found himself involved with this year. In April, Naka publicly blasted Square Enix on Twitter over his removal as director from Balan Wonderworld prior to its release, blaming Square for the game’s critical failure. This outburst came after the conclusion of a lawsuit he’d previously filed against the publisher. Naka is best known as the lead programmer behind the original Sonic the Hedgehog games for Sega Genesis and Nights into Dreams. \n[Source: FNN]",

The video revealed some details on the project’s status as well as some early images. \n\n\nThe Splinter Cell remake was first announced last December, but we’ve known very little about it other than it’s being rebuilt from scratch in Snowdrop Engine (used to make The Division, Mario + Rabbids games). In the video, the team states the experience will be identical to the 2002 title but it wants to implement improvements and features introduced in later Splinter Cell titles as well as smooth some rough edges. For example, the team wants to give players more opportunities to de-escalate situations when things go awry instead of getting an instant Game Over. \nThe dev team also shares that the project is still in the early prototyping phase. As such, the studio will be going dark “for a while” to focus on making the game, so it will likely be a good while before we hear anything substantial about the remake again. In the meantime, you can take a look at the gallery of new concept images shared during the presentation below. \n\nSplinter Cell doesn’t have a release window or announced platforms. This remake is only one of many on the horizon, and you can keep up with all of them by checking our big list of upcoming video game remakes.",

And now, due to Saints Row failing to meet the full expectations of Embracer Group, developer Volition will become part of Gearbox Entertainment. \nThis news comes by way of Video Games Chronicle, which reports that Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors discussed this transition in a statement released alongside the company's second-quarter earning results. \n\n\n\"The reception of Saints Row did not meet the full expectations and left the fanbase partially polarized,\" Wingefores said in the statement. \"The game development studio, Volition, has been working hard to improve the player experience. Financially, Saints Row has performed in line with management expectations in the quarter. Going forward, Volition will transition to become part of Gearbox which has all the tools, including an experienced management team in the US, to create future success at Volition.\"\nWingefors notes that this is the first time the company has performed an \"internal group transfer where we transfer a major studio between operative groups,\" but says that \"it is not necessarily the last.\" \nSaints Row currently sits at 61 on Metacritic (for the PlayStation 5 version), with a user score of 2.1. Game Informer gave the game an 8.5 out of 10 in its review and you can read what we liked about Saints Row here. \n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]\nDid you play Saints Row?

The ability to clone or share orders with vehicles grouped by shared orders. An improved local authority action window which now shows you actions you can’t afford, instead of hiding them.
