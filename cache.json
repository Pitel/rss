By taking heavy inspiration from Nintendo (and specifically the Super Mario franchise), developer Team Asobi has undoubtedly crafted one of the finest platformers in recent memory.\nOne individual who has been spending time with the game is none other than Masahiro Sakurai, the legendary creator behind the Kirby and Super Smash Bros. franchises. In an effort to plug his latest YouTube video on game runtimes, he posted a tweet to state that he has completed Astro Bot and rescued all 300 of the lost bots. He says that while this didn't take a great deal of time, he found the game interesting enough that he simply couldn't help but play it.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It's an expectations-subverting masterclass that received rave reviews upon its release on Steam.

The simple premise played host to an impressively well-made and enjoyable adventure that felt like a meaningful homage to — and evolution of — classic platformer game design, although it never quite captured the audience that it deserved. Clearly sales were sufficient to justify a sequel, however, and Medallion Games has now graced us with Grapple Dogs: Cosmic Canines. This sophomore outing for Pablo and friends proves to be an even stronger game than the first one, and we’d highly suggest you give it a look if you’re a fan of 2D platformers.\nGrapple Dogs picks up almost immediately where its predecessor left off, which teased that Pablo’s adventure wasn’t quite over with his defeat of the robot, Nul. It turns out that Nul’s antics inadvertently released an evil godlike being named Vyr, which threatens to destroy the entire multiverse if the four pieces of the shattered Allkrystal aren't collected. Pablo isn’t the only hero whose universe has a stake in this brewing conflict, however, and he's soon joined on his quest by another grapple dog named Luna—a no-nonsense, gun-wielding pup who doesn’t have time to play nice. Together, the two set out to track down the pieces of the Allkrystal and hopefully find a way to defeat Vyr before all is lost.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

We have fond memories of playing through the Advance trilogy (and even the tangentially related fighting RPG and pinball spinoffs) in the early 2000s, but bar the SonicN N-Gage port and a Virtual Console release in Japan, we haven't had the chance to play them on any new hardware since.\nWith the fan adoration for these games, a remake or remaster feels like a no-brainer, no?

Showcasing a modest but noticeable boost (at least when zooming in on the pixels as the presentation did) to several games in Sony's back catalogue — including Marvel's Spider-Man 2 (2023), Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart (2021), and The Last of Us II Remastered (2024) — the price was then revealed: $699 / £699 / €799.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

One that favours the joyous freeform sightseeing of an Elden Ring or Breath Of The Wild; where you’ll scramble up vast industrial concrete ruins on scavenging missions for inquisitive frogs, instead of being nagged by bothersome checklists?\nOk, rain check on that last point. SandWitch can’t help but eventually funnel the freedom of ambling around in your chuffy yellow van into restrictive collect-a-thons. Still, for much of its breezy runtime, this one’s a real panacea for gaming’s more bloated map-scourers. Plus, even when you are sent off to hamster-cheek scavenged components before making progress, there’s very little in this world that doesn’t feel intentional. Sidequests and storytelling crumbs are deliberately scattered throughout, and each building is a thoughtful concrete puzzle box. It is, in brief, a nice time.\nYou play as Sauge, a spacefarer returned to her planet of Cigalo after receiving a distress signal from her missing sister. Cigalo’s a cheery place, though economically and environmentally devastated after being exploited by an evil spacecorp named The Consortium. It’s populated by small settlements of people, some large talking frogs named the Reinetos, and the occasional friendly robot. Everything’s friendly, as it goes - even gravity itself. There’s no danger, no death, no damage from flinging yourself off the tallest building you can find. Just helping out your desert buds, upgrading your van with more gadgets to solve puzzles, or working on finding exactly where Sauge’s sister has go to.\n Read more",

          "description": "Steam’s family sharing feature Steam Families is now available to everyone on the platform, letting up to six total people share games from a single library, with each individual having access to their own saved games, achievements, and workshop files.\nThis means that, yes, when you all sit down together in the evening, you can enjoy a hearty family meal in the knowledge that between you, you technically own six copies of the Cities Skylines Big Butt Skinner Balloon.\nEach person on the account will have one of two roles: adult or child. Adults can manage parental controls, set hourly or daily playtime limits, approve purchase requests, and control store access. Valve appear very proud of making it easier for parents to spend money, streamlining the “time-consuming” task of buying games for their kids.\n \nRead more",

          "description": "There are cold opens and there are freezing ones. Sci-fi roguelike shooter Wild Bastards doesn't start on its strongest cowboy boot. You are dumped into the middle of an interstellar chase and summarily shown the ropes. The guns feel simplistic, the arenas bare, the loot vanilla, and the entire loop of beaming down to a planet and getting into small-scale \"showdowns\" threatens to become stale within the first hour or so. But then you find an outlaw buddy who offers a new way to shoot human dirtbags. Then another fellow bandit. And another. By the time your spaceship is half-filled with scoundrels and weirdoes shouting at each other, the game has warmed up enough to reveal its central idea. This ain't no grand FPS campaign, nor is it quick as roguelikes go. It's a snacky shootout sim with tumbleweed towns that feels best when you savour the pre-fight suspense.\nRead more",

Then again, I imagine Sam Fisher was a toddler once. Perhaps this is how he got started: escaping a smashed-up house full of roaming demon toys.\nRead more",

Ubiquitous wearable sci-fi shields repel any attack that comes in too fast, so everyone has to learn this unique, overtly dance-like form of close-quarters combat where every thrust and parry is necessarily slow and considered. Picture it: careful judgments of your movements, weighing up the right time to strike, every measured jab part of a wider strategy that culminates in the kill.\nMOBAs are like that. Both in the fights themselves, sort of, where probing lunges lead up to bursts of lethality, but more broadly in each match as a whole. They’re map-wide knife fights, where a thrust is a well-judged lane push and a parry a savvy item buy. At first, playing Smite 2 felt akin to watching on helplessly as my opponents repeatedly shoved their crysknives through my ribs. After 30 hours, it often still feels like that - but I am enjoying myself. Mostly. Despite Valve’s third-person elephant in the lane. \nRead more",

          "description": "Nikhil Murthy's Syphilisation is a \"postcolonial 4X game\", which might sound like a contradiction in terms. While approaches to 4X and grand strategy vary hugely between games, factions and players, the genre as a whole is firmly wedded to imperial conquest, both structurally and at the level of narrative aspects and set-dressing. Many 4X games are triumphal re-enactments of specific periods of colonial settlement and expansion. All of which is to say that Syphilisation is fascinating. It's a reworking of the genre which dismantles and reconstructs concepts such as diplomacy, research and production. It's also just left early access - find more details and a playthrough video below.\n Read more",

While it wasn't outstanding in the grander landscape of gaming, enough Warhammer 40K fans seem to have cherished the escapades of bulky blue boltgunner Demetrian Titus for the action game to merit a sequel a decade later. It left its story on something of a cliffhanger, with said hero being dragged away to face untold tortures by the Inquisition, the most zealous sect of this preternaturally paranoid sci-fi universe. Today, Titus is free again. Free to stomp towards hordes of alien foes, blast them with a plasma incinerator, and shred the stragglers with a chainsaw sword. Space Marine 2 is an often-satisfying scrapper that has me  convinced of 40K's merit as a crafting ground for excellent-looking environments and creatures, even if I'm not particularly moved by the bland character of Titus and his fellow Ultramarines.\nRead more",

The DLC is reportedly so bug-ridden that it’s taken many of the base game’s core systems down with it.\nGearbox - who acquired Risk Of Rain from Hopoo Games in 2022 - have since put out a blog with a list of known issues they’re targeting, and encourage players to keep submitting bug reports. Among the listed issues are a boss named Mithrix becoming invincible (“definitely not intentional”), and “an issue that allowed players to get stuck while smelling the flowers”.\nRead more",

          "description": "In the first post for my series on \"saving\" open world design, I complained that many of today's open worlds feel like checklists of formulaic tasks and rewards, their geography a vaporous staging ground for itemisable, cycling content-gathering opportunities, which flies in the face of the sense of freedom and wonder they're supposed to inspire. My interviewees, Elder Scrolls veterans Matt Firor and Nate Purkeypile, argued that this reflects the expense and scale of today's open world productions, which constrains experimental design both at a practical level and in terms of overall direction.\nCD Projekt open world designer Jakub Tomczak doesn't, as far as I know, have an answer to the issue of production bloat, but he does have a disarmingly obvious solution to the 'checklist problem', based on his time creating missions for Cyberpunk 2077 and its Phantom Liberty expansion: get better at hiding the checklist. Weave it into the landscape and setting more artfully, with an elegant balance of randomisation and responsiveness to the player's behaviour which keeps everything fresh. \r\n\n \nRead more",

It blew the dust from my synapses.\nThe same appears true of King-Spooner's upcoming Judero, on which he is collaborating with Soul Searching developer Talha Kaya. It casts you as a \"pagan seer\" armed with a big stick, who is searching the mythical Scottish borderlands for evil creatures to clobber. It looks cheerier and airier than Sluggish Morss, with a more overt emphasis on mechanics such as combat, but it has the same pickled 3am energy to it.

          "description": "I would not be at all surprised to learn that the voice actors in stealthy Mimimi-style cone’em up Sumerian Six are Americans doing impressions of British accents. The opening radio chat between starting squad member Sid and a pal has that telltale charming tinge of overeager cockney. It also contains the words “bloody” and “arse” in quick succession, though thankfully not next to each other. The only piles are the logs Sid’s crouched behind as he prepares to sneak up to a cable car guarded by Nazis. That is the only haemorrhoids allusion I will ever make on this website. Until the next time I have to write about Andrew Wilson.\n“Oil just use my trusty knoife” mutters Sid as I take down my first guard. Straight away, the animation and noise indicators evoke the same Shadow Tactics or Desperados III goodness you’re probably expecting. Fine with me - that’s exactly what I’m here for. Mimimi’s closing was a real gutpunch, and while I don’t expect anyone to match their exceptional work any time soon, it’s at least reassuring to see Warsaw studio Artificer picking up the torch.\nRead more",

It's just like all those cozy games you've tried out on Steam, but somehow even more chilled out. The game is already available on mobile devices, but it's been enhanced for the handheld console to allow for even more replayability and a completely different experience in some cases.

Not that I’m subscribed to Extra or Premium, but if you are, there’s some cool stuff. Plucky Squire is a pretty exciting upcoming title and Night in the Woods is pretty boss (so I’ve heard).

Not really. However, it’s an interesting and unique game, which makes it worth playing. You take the role of a mosquito that has to harass a family until they all suffer a catastrophic mental breakdown. I can really relate to that. It’s the sort of weird concept that was more common back before publishers learned that the only way to make enough money to feed their super-yacht addictions is to put a dude with a gun on the cover.\n\n\nYou’ve also got Skygunner, a decent 2001 on-rails shooter from back when those were still a thing. There’s also Secret Agent Clank from the days when there was far too much Ratchet & Clank.\n\n\nNow I will paste… No, wait, they formatted this in a very unpaste-able way.

          "description": "The top 25 list for LaLiga has been revealed for EA FC 25, and it's dominated by the Spanish giants Barcelona and Real Madrid.\n\n\nThat's not surprising, given the duo has always been the two top dogs of the league. Both squads have several Spanish and global superstars among their ranks, and many of them have found a place on the top 25 list. Without further ado, let's take a look at who has made the cut, along with the best cards.\n\n\nComplete list of top 25 LaLiga players in EA FC 25\n\n\nLet's first take a look at all the cards, along with their overall ratings and base positions.\n\n\n\nKylian Mbappe ST 91\n\n\nJude Bellingham CAM 90\n\n\nVini Jr. LW 90\n\n\nThibaut Courtois GK 89\n\n\nMarc Andre Ter Stegen GK 89\n\n\nAntoinne Griezmann ST 88\n\n\nRobert Lewandowski ST 88\n\n\nFederico Valverde CM 88\n\n\nJan Oblak GK 88\n\n\nAntonio Rudiger CB 88\n\n\nFrenkie De Jong CM 87\n\n\nRodrygo RW 86\n\n\nLuka Modric CM 86\n\n\nDani Carvajal RB 86\n\n\nPedri CM 86\n\n\nUnai Simon GK 86\n\n\nEder Militao CB 85\n\n\nJules Kounde CB 85\n\n\nNico Williams LM 85\n\n\nAurelien Tchouameni CDM 85\n\n\nDavid Alaba CB 85\n\n\nRonald Araujo CB 85\n\n\nMamardashvili GK 85\n\n\nIago Aspas ST 84\n\n\nAlex Remiro GK 84\n\n\n\n\n\nAs far as the ratings are concerned, Real Madrid has managed to trump their traditional rivals. The top three cards all belong to the Madrid giants: Kylian Mbappe, Jude Bellingham, and Vinicius. Out of them, Bellingham has received one of the biggest buffs—he is rated at only 86 in EA FC 24.\n\n\nGoalkeeper Marc Andre Ter Stegen is Barcelona's highest-rated card this year, followed by Robert Lewandowski at 88. Based on the ratings, Real Madrid should be an excellent choice for many players in Seasons and Career Mode. Inaki Williams also experienced a big jump in his numbers following an impressive year for both the club and the country.\n\n\nWe will have detailed reviews for all these cards once EA FC 25 goes live in early access on September 20.\n\nThe post EA FC 25: Top 25 LaLiga players appeared first on Destructoid.",
