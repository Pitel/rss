Of course, it absolutely should do for 300 bucks, but looking at the myriad details crammed into the 2500-piece set — which covers both Ocarina of Time and Breath of the Wild incarnations of the ancient tree — the care and attention that's gone into this latest Nintendo-themed Lego creation is obvious.\nEschewing the innovative play features of the course-based Lego Super Mario line, this build carries an 18+ age recommendation so it's clearly targeting a different demographic from the Mario or Animal Crossing sets. Those are great, but for adults it's perhaps more exciting to see larger builds and pieces meant equally for display in addition to play.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

He began speaking at middle schools, high schools, and universities regarding the importance of drug abuse prevention and how making positive choices can lead to a more fulfilled life. So wholesome, right?\nUnfortunately, it seems like Curcio is up to his old tricks. According to a report from Fox 13 Seattle (thanks, Nintendo Wire), he and an accomplice, Iosif Bondarchuk, were recently arrested over their potential involvement in scamming up to $2 million from buyers of rare Pokémon and sports cards.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Understanding any given sentence in Wuthering Waves is like trying to discern sensible meaning from the back of a rain-bleached Doritos packet you found while cleaning your gutters. Last week, players of the character action gacha asked for more freedom to skip story scenes and dialogue. Having sunk a bunch of hours into the game, I can see why. The combat may be swish and the traversal across its rolling landscape flowing and carefree, but the lore-obsessed babble of its characters is mind-numbing. Wuthering Waves has been this month's lightning rod for hype. But it's worth dissecting what it's actually like to play.\nRead more",

          "description": "To kick off with some extremely half-arsed mytho-geometry, the original Frostpunk was a testament to both the design utility and the inexhaustible political symbolism of circles. When people wish to found a community of equals they commonly form a circle, with each participant visible and audible to the rest. A circle is also the best shape for defending against an engulfing ambient threat such as a global ice age, because it has no weak points, and it makes a great centrepiece for a videogame interface, a symmetrical motif that can be tuned and adorned to either suck your attention into the screen or distribute it evenly in all directions.\nCreated by Polish developers 11 bit, Frostpunk takes place in the middle of a circle, an Arctic crater with a huge coal generator at its heart. Your city rises in rings around that generator, each additional layer of dwellings corresponding intuitively to decreasing temperature, and the result is one of the most focused and thematically consistent specimens of its genre - a building game that feels as intimate and urgent as tending a campfire. Frostpunk 2's new campaign mode breaks the circle open. It starts where you (hopefully) ended, with the crater now fully colonised and evolved into a glaring, blue-orange geode of high-density housing and clustered chimneys. But the view has been pulled back, and construction now unfolds along the plains and canyons beyond the crater, which consist not of circles but of hexagons - another UI designer's favourite - on which you'll plot out upgradeable districts rather than assembling individual buildings. \r\n \nRead more",

Besides, these specs include a gigantic 80Whr battery upgrade (doubling the ROG Ally’s 40Whr capacity), so we can at least file this under \"News James wants to be true.\"\nRead more",

Innocent times and places like the prologue for Baldur's Gate, which unfolds in the vast, fortified monastery of Candlekeep (beware spoilers from this point on).\nBioWare's first ever RPG opens with your unsuspecting Chosen One learning the ropes from the old sage Gorion. There are fetchquests that take you around the enormous citadel, bits of combat training to do, cosy formative chinwags to have with characters like your childhood friend Imoen. But it's not to last, of course: Gorion is murdered, and you must rove the Sword Coast in pursuit of his killer. When you return to Candlekeep later in the game, this once-proud bastion of learning has been filled with doppelgangers of Gorion and other acquaintances, a parade of chatbots waiting to stab you in the back.\r\n \nRead more",

The kind that probably has twelve artists dedicated to the recreation of visible pores, that sort of thing. It’s so focused on looking pretty that it hasn’t even noticed the title and subtitle got mixed up.\nSure enough, Hellblade 2 is a harsh test for older hardware, with a heavy reliance on DLSS or FSR upscaling to keep performance sweet. That said, it’s no Dragons Dogma 2-style technical horrorshow either. A happy balance of visuals and smoothness is attainable on plush PCs and low-end laptops alike, while DLSS 3 frame generation can deliver an effective kick in the framerate pants on RTX 40 series GPUs.\nRead more",

The first Prison Architect allowed you to finesse every detail of a secure correctional facility, down to each cell and dog kennel. Unsurprisingly for a sim about prison, it encouraged obsessive control. The 3D-ified sequel isn't finished yet, but it's taking a similar approach. Maybe a little too similar.\nRead more",

Lorelei, despite its single-solution puzzles, is not dictatorial. It’s far too interested in collaborating with you for that. It wants you to observe, consider, and interpret its many mysteries.

          "description": "I've clocked up nearly 400 hours playing BioWare's big fantasy RPG Dragon Age: Inquisition, which is not a stat I'm particularly proud of. I'm not ashamed either, partly because, as has been identified by artist Corey Brickley, via the Maw, there's a lot of filler. Brickley has collated a list of suggested mods to slim down Dragon Age: Inquisition from a potentially 80 hours-long epic to a trim 40 hour story-focused romp, which means you might be able to play through it again in time for the launch of Dragon Age: Dreadwolf - which is a direct sequel to Inquisition.\nI find this list of mods interesting! It's a way to change the game quite substantially without exactly transforming it, and it's very in-keeping with my campaign to make games 60% smaller. Still, there's at least one item on there I'd push back on, but also this isn't really a new problem for Dragon Age as a series.\nRead more",

          "description": "Being offered a 4X game for free is definitely one of those cursed-monkey-paw situations. Sure, you’re saving physical currency, but at what price in terms of that most treasured and least tradeable of commodities, time? In the hours it takes to properly clean out a 4X game, you could probably build an empire yourself. OK, not a huge empire. An empire the size of the Vatican or the Principality of Sealand, perhaps. Maybe an empire that only covers the distance between your desk and your fridge. But an empire nonetheless. Go on, pronounce yourself God-Tyrant of your bedroom while you download Amplitude’s Endless Legend, which is 100% off on Steam  till 10am PDT, 1pm EDT and 6pm BST on May 23rd.\n Read more",

I’ll have something a bit more put-together to say in the not-too-distant future, so please stay tuned. It might be NieR, it might not be NieR. (Laughs.)

In it, we get a few breathtaking cinematics and a first look into gameplay.\n\n\n\n\nPrepare for an adrenaline-pumping adventure as the trailer introduces a host of formidable monsters. The first battle showcases a massive bear-like creature, promising a challenging boss fight. The reptilian adversaries are equally menacing, adding even more formidable showdowns.\n\n\nMonster Hunter's classic combat still holds true in this next iteration, where we see the brutality of a gun first-hand. And, of course, there needed to be at least one gigantic sword, as one of the characters deals a deadly blow to the creature.\n\n\nUnfortunately, we didn't get an exact release date for Monster Hunter Wilds, as the trailer only depicted cinematics and gameplay. However, we do know that it is slated for 2025 at least, and wishlists are currently available.\n\n\nSimilar to past iterations, Monster Hunter Wilds has you hunting down for, you guessed it, monsters. Given that it's in the wilds, the environment will change constantly. That means extra challenges are ahead, bringing out unique wildlife across the Forbidden Lands.\n\n\nFor those who have journeyed with the series in the past, Wilds brings a wealth of new moves, weapons, and equipment to master. Get ready to explore fresh strategies and unleash devastating attacks with these exciting additions.\n\n\nWhile we eagerly await an official release date, one thing is certain: Monster Hunter Wilds will be a multi-platform adventure. You can look forward to embarking on this thrilling hunt on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC sometime in 2025.\n\nThe post Monster Hunter Wilds gets a first look at its gameplay in the latest trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

This cutting-edge technology, combined with \"unlocked frame rates\" and \"super ultrawide support,\" ensures an extraordinary gaming experience.\n\n\n\n\nYou can also play the Valhalla DLC, which will be a part of the PC release, to get more bang for your buck. In this story, you'll experience the journey of Kratos and Atreus as they explore the Nine Realms. The action-adventure game unravels the secrets within Ragnarok's profound lore, which is heavily tied to Greek mythology.\n\n\nI've pleasantly enjoyed seeing the God of War franchise take off over the years. I remember the old PS2 days when Kratos was just a brute with a large weapon. Now, he's become a loving father to show off his more sentimental side. It's not something I quite expected, but it's welcomed, nonetheless. \n\n\nNow that the God of War Ragnarok PC release is on its way, I'm curious to see when the next entry will debut. But for now, make sure to mark your calendars for its Sept. 19, 2024 debut.\n\nThe post God of War Ragnarok launching on PC this September appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "PlayStation's unofficial mascot, at least in my eyes, is back for his own big adventure. Astro Bot is a fully fledged new game starring the rambunctious little bot, and it arrives on PlayStation 5 on September 6, 2024.\n\n\nPreviously starring in games like Astro Bot Rescue Mission for Sony's VR headset and in the fantastic launch title Astro's Playroom for the PS5, Astro Bot gives Team Asobi's little fella a game all his own. Granted, it looks like he'll still be platforming around, meeting famous Sony characters, and utilizing PlayStation tech from throughout the console lineup's history.\n\n\n\n\nWe can expect more than 50 worlds to explore, which is a substantial amount of Astro Bot to dig into. But if it remains as charming and fun as the previous games, this might be a big-hitter for Sony. At least in today's trailer, shown off during the Sony State of Play, we can see plenty of fun levels and interesting gameplay moments, including flying a giant PlayStation 5 into space.\n\n\nIt will have to carry the weight either way, as today's State of Play was a little short on other major Sony reveals. Concord feels like it's already off to a rough start after its official unveiling, and other games felt like they only got small updates, with several major games like Monster Hunter Wilds still aiming for 2025 rather than 2024.\n\n\nI believe in Astro Bot, though. He's quickly become a favorite face of mine in the Sony roster, and this new entry looks delightful. If nothing else, I have a hopefully solid platformer to look forward to on September 6.\n\nThe post Astro Bot gets a brand-new mission in a self-titled adventure this September appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "As part of the PlayStation State of Play stream, Konami and Bloober Team have given us a deeper look at the remake of Silent Hill 2. It focuses mostly on Angela Orosco, as well as some pretty familiar-looking scenes from the game. More importantly, we have a release date of October 8, 2024.\n\n\nI think it looks decent. What do you think? Here’s the trailer:\n\n\n\n\nThere’s a lot that’s really familiar being shown off. It looks to me like Bloober Team are trying very hard to keep it as close to the original as they can while making modern changes. However, it doesn’t really matter how careful they are; they’re working on an extremely beloved game, and not everyone is going to love it.\n\n\nFrankly, I think Silent Hill 2 is a great game, but I’m not huge on it. Don’t get me wrong, it’s fantastic, I’m just not totally enthusiastic. I don’t think a remake is really going to change that, but I’m open to the possibility.\n\n\nSilent Hill 2 (the remake) is out on October 8, 2024 for PS5 and PC.\n\nThe post Fill your eyes with a Silent Hill 2 remake trailer and its release date appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "During Sony's May 30 2024 State of Play, developer Firewalk Studios detailed its upcoming 5v5 PvP-focused FPS called Concord. Originally revealed in 2023, this is the first concrete details we've seen about Concord since. After starting with a nearly 5-minute long cinematic trailer that gave massive Guardians of the Galaxy vibes, we got a roughly 2-minute long gameplay trailer that looked a lot like Overwatch.\n\n\n\n\nPlayers take on the role of a Freegunner and join their teammates to take on rival Freegunner crews in space heists across six different 5v5 PvP modes that take places on a variety of planets and exotic maps on those planets. There seems to be some pretty interesting variety between the characters, but the genre feels so overdone at this point I can't help but wonder if Concord is a bit late to the party.\n\n\nConcord is a PlayStation 5 console exclusive but will also launch on PC, though despite the recent Helldivers 2 fiasco, Concord will in fact require a PlayStation Network account to be played on PC. Those interested in taking on the role of a Freegunner and jumping into the 5v5 PvP gameplay will have the opportunity to do so when the Early Access beta drops on June 6, 2024, with the full release scheduled for August 23, 2024.\n\nThe post Concord is a 5v5 first-person shooter that feels late to the party appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Today marks the official release of Redfall’s last update, which brings the game to a sad and premature end. \n\n\nRedfall didn’t really impress when it dropped earlier this year, but for those few gamers who are still hanging on, this new update actually does provide some exciting features. Arkane has added a “Community Standing” system that lets you progress through six different ranks of various buffs by completing missions, unlocking Safehouses, and saving citizens. There are also a substantial number of smaller changes, like the new Elder Nests that serve as boss battles, new enemies and weapons, and improvements to the game’s lackluster AI. Plus there’s an added “Story Mode” difficulty setting to help players relax while vanquishing vampires. \n\n\nOf course, this update also adds an offline mode to the game, so whenever the Redfall servers go offline, people can still keep playing. Microsoft recently announced the closure of Arkane Austin, along with three other studios, in a brutal move that’s still a bit hard to understand. It’s not the first time Microsoft has made aggressive cuts this year – in January alone the company announced it would be laying off 1,900 employees. \n\n\nArkane included a brief message in the patch notes, writing, “We’re thankful for the millions of players who have joined us. From everyone at Arkane Austin, thank you for playing our games and loving our worlds, it’s been an honor to deliver these experiences to you.” \n\n\nRedfall won’t be getting its planned DLC, and presumably, we won’t be seeing anything else from Arkane Austin.

While there's no release date in place, developer Bread Panda revealed the roguelite action game for PC in a trailer that shows off its shooting in side- and forward-scrolling flavors.\n\n\nThe trailer also gives us a peek at the beautiful art that fuels it all, both in its characters and creatures and the colorful world they inhabit.  \n\n\n\n\nIn what sounds like a futile affair, AVA's destiny involves fading away with the rest of the world. With the end all but inevitable, AVA soars through the islands of the Sidereal Riptide, blasting away at enemies, collecting artifacts, and hopefully solving the mysteries that await. \n\n\nAs the trailer shows, one of the key hooks of that journey is the way AVA can transition from firing away on a 2D plane to blasting forth through visuals akin to classic rail shooters like Space Harrier. From what I can gather, at least, it looks like more of a visual trick that retains the side-scrolling combat on a different plane. However it may work, it's still a very cool idea that looks great in motion. \n\n\nScreenshot via Bread Panda\n\n\nBread Panda took inspiration from roguelites and adventure games, with the former lending itself to repeat expeditions that play out in unique ways. There's also the mechanic of collecting artifacts and choosing which to keep and which to return to the Riptide, giving you the opportunity to customize AVA's fighting style with various weapons and relics. AVA and the Half-World will eventually be entering an increasingly busy space, but I'm keen on seeing how its key gimmick and idiosyncratic design sense play out in practice. \n\nThe post AVA and the Half-World is a perspective-switching roguelite with captivating art appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "After allowing players to level up their weapons faster in XDefiant last weekend, Ubisoft decided to come back and gift everyone another double weapon XP period. \n\n\nUbisoft confirmed that double weapon XP will be available starting Friday at 10 a.m. ET and ending Monday at 1 p.m. ET. This comes after players complained that XDefiant's weapon progression is 'criminally slow.' \n\n\nOne XDefiant player claimed it takes over 100 hours to level up one weapon. XDefiant developer Patrick 'ACHES' Price clapped back and attempted to reassure fans by claiming that its 3500 XP per weapon level and one kill equals 100 XP. So, operating under that math, it is a maximum of 35 kills per level. \n\n\n\n\nFor secondary weapons, that requirement is even less, with 1500 XP per weapon level. Each weapon has 50 levels, meaning it could take players a few hours to reach the max level on every weapon, but it all depends on their skill level. \n\n\nSkilled players should be able to get around 20-30 kills per round, but that's also no easy feat. It's unclear how much of a difference it makes with double XP active, but users should take advantage of it while they can. To get XP faster, Domination or Occupy. Both game modes are fast-paced and take place on the title's smaller-scaled maps. \n\nThe post XDefiant brings back double weapon XP for a second straight weekend appeared first on Destructoid.",

Wizards of the Coast and Sony/Bungie have now teamed up to bring Dungeons and Dragons to Destiny 2. Kindly put aside the finale you've been waiting a decade for, it's time to pony up some cash for medieval fantasy gear in a science fiction shooter.\n\n\nSomehow, the Mindflayer Warlock makes too much sense\n\n\n\n\nThe announcement came via the official Destiny 2 account on X. Fans of both franchises will be able to indulge on June 4, 2024, when the collaboration goes live with the release of The Final Shape. From armor sets to an emblem and even a physical Eye Tyrant Ghost Shell, there's plenty here.\n\n\n\nApex Draconic Set (Titan)\n\n\nFlayer's Dominion Set (Warlock)\n\n\nSpectral Displacer Set (Hunter)\n\n\nQueen of Dragons Ship\n\n\nOwlbear Chariot Sparrow\n\n\nEye Tyrant Ghost Shell\n\n\nBigby's Fist Finisher\n\n\nNatural 20 Emote\n\n\n\n\nImage via Bungie\n\n\nImage via Bungie\n\n\n\nThis isn't the first time that Bungie has partnered with another property in a bizarre crossover. Earlier this year, we had the Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire crossover, and prior to that, Bungie teamed up with CD Projekt Red for a Witcher crossover (though Cyberpunk would have made more sense).\n\n\nIn a world where corporations are teaming up to milk their audiences for all they're worth, it's not shocking to see collaborations. However, all I ask is that they try to fit the theme of one another. Destiny is a series set in the far-flung future, so when medieval properties get thrown in, it feels very out of place. But, enough of my grousing, let's focus on the real issue: the lack of an Astarion Hunter set.\n\nThe post Move over Ghostbusters, D&D is the new weird Destiny 2 collab appeared first on Destructoid.",

I’ve checked my home and native land Canada’s site, and it’s marked down to $69.99 Canadian Loonies. It’s also discounted on Amazon in Germany and the UK.\n\n\nIt’s a decent price for a grand and varied adventure. It’s a lot of adventure. Maybe too much. But it’s a very different sort of adventure compared to Final Fantasy VII: Remake. Sure, it still features the same mechanics, characters, and feel. Sure, it’s a continuation of the previous story (and the middle part of a trilogy), but both tonally and in terms of setting, it’s an entirely new ballgame. Also, there’s lots of time to appreciate Barrett.

But, with the release of MW3 and Warzone Season 4, that has since changed with the thieving abilities of the Copy and Dupe Operators.\n\n\nWhat makes them so extraordinary is their Identity Theft Finishing Move, which can steal another player's skin and place it on to your own Operator. So, if you see someone causing havoc as The Boys' Homelander, you can put 'em in their place by taking and using their skin. Call of Duty reposted a snippet of what it looks like in action, where the player Speros copies the skin of an unfortunate Warzone player.\n\n\n\n\nWhile the result of copying the Operator skins is the primary show-stopper, it doesn't hurt that the ability just looks cool. It's as if Copy or Dupe are sucking the life out of someone, using a cloudy effect.\n\n\nThe only downside is that the Blackcell Operator's stealing technique is temporary. That means you'll immediately lose out on the skin upon death. However, it could bring about a challenge to see how long you can last with a particular Operator.\n\n\nThe Blackcell bundle will also still cost you, going for a price of $29.99 in the COD shop. This comes with the Season 4 Battle Pass, too, and a few more valuable gear. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nDespite its paywall, getting ahold of Copy and Dupe in MW3 and Warzone could be worth it.

          "description": "If you haven’t followed Infinity Nikki, it’s equal parts charming, beautiful, and ambitious. The open-world game is the latest entry in the Nikki series of fashion games, which is very popular in Asia, and Westerners are getting their biggest exposure to it yet with this charming adventure. \n\n\nThe game unfolds on the magical continent of Miraland, and Nikki must save it. Her main power is \"styling,\" which involves changing clothes from different nations, allowing her to adopt unique abilities. For example, one outfit allows her to float while another cleanses corrupted creatures of demonic energy. The trailer shows one outfit that lets players summon a giant flower to glide through the air. Another ability shrinks her to the size of her small companion, Momo, to access tight areas and other locations. \nThe more outfits you collect, the more abilities Nikki has to solve puzzles and overcome platforming obstacles. But despite the \"save the world\" premise, Infinity Nikki is billed as a relaxing adventure. You can also catch bugs, go fishing, and gather resources to craft new outfits, among other activities. \nInfinity Nikki looks wild, and fans can get their first taste of it in a beta test happening during Q3 of this year. The game is coming to PC and PlayStation 5.",

          "description": "Developer Survios has released the first look at gameplay in its upcoming VR game, Alien: Rogue Incursion, and it turns out, exploring a seemingly abandoned  facility in VR looks as terrifying as you'd expect.\nThe trailer aired during today's PlayStation State of Play as the game is coming to PS VR2, but it's also coming to Meta Quest 3 and Steam (for other PC VR devices) this holiday season. In the trailer, we get a few glimpses of some Xenomorphs, the tracking device we'll be using to avoid said Xenomorphs, and a look at some pods that indicate we might be fighting more than one. \nCheck it out for yourself in the Alien: Rogue Incursion gameplay trailer below: \n\n\nIn a new PlayStation Blog post, Survios chief product officer TQ Jefferson explains that Alien: Rogue Incursion was developed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. Jefferson also shares that the \"high tension shooter\" tasks players with exploring an \"overrun facility on the inhospitable planet Purdan.\" \n\"Dynamically spawning and pathing with countless unique possibilities, even we couldn't tell you exactly where and when each Xenomorph will strike, let alone what strategies it might use or if it'll bring some friends,\" the blog post reads. \"While heart-pounding combat is the core of Alien: Rogue Incursion, grabbing your pulse rifle and blasting your way out of every situation is not always the best strategy. \n\"Constantly hunted by unpredictable and resourceful Xenomorphs, players will often find creativity and a level head to be their greatest weapons, especially when it comes to leveraging the environment to their advantage.\" \nAlien: Rogue Incursion hits VR this holiday season. \nAre you going to check out Alien: Rogue Incursion later this year?

          "description": "Until Dawn, the 2015 horror adventure game from Supermassive Games, is coming to PlayStation 5 and PC in remake form this fall. We received a new trailer for the beloved game alongside the announcement during today's State of Play presentation. \nUntil Dawn puts you in control of eight teenagers/young adults who venture up a mountain for a fun night in a secluded cabin. In typical slasher-movie fashion, there is much more than meets the eye regarding this cabin and its surrounding area. Relying heavily on player choice, Until Dawn's narrative uses a system called the Butterfly Effect, where pivotal choices you make have consequences that go far beyond that which you can immediately recognize. The game stars actors like Rami Malek, Hayden Panettiere, Meaghan Martin, and more.\n\n\nOriginally announced as a full remake of the game, the trailer footage does not appear to be a significant step up in terms of visuals, appearing to be more in line with the industry's definition of a remaster. PlayStation's official description says it's been \"rebuilt and enhanced for PS5 consoles and PC.\" Developed by Ballistic Moon, this improved version also boasts new environments, collectibles, and re-cut narrative sequences. \nWe loved Until Dawn when it arrived on PlayStation 4 in 2015, awarding it a score of 9 out of 10. In the time since Until Dawn's original release, Supermassive has released other games in the genre, including The Dark Pictures Anthology and The Quarry. The studio is currently working on The Casting of Frank Stone, a game set in the Dead by Daylight universe. Until Dawn arrives on PlayStation 5 and PC this fall.",

They almost always feature large-scale battles in which the lead character can sweep through dozens of enemy combatants with a single swing.\nThat playstyle appears to remain intact if this new trailer is to be believed.\nA lot has changed in action gameplay in the years since Dynasty Warriors was at its most popular, but there’s no doubt that the series once had an enthusiastic fanbase.\nWe’ll see if the series is able to update its gameplay and draw in new fans when it hits PlayStation 5 next year.",

Unlike the last entry, Astro Bot: Rescue Mission, which was a PS5 launch title and a glorified (but very fun) tech demo for the console, this new game is a full-fledged platforming adventure. It's also got an easy-to-remember name: Astro Bot. \nThe trailer sees Astro Bot soaring through the galaxy on a Dual Sense-shaped spaceship to explore a variety of vibrant platforming stages set to a smile-inducing soundtrack. He also shows off new abilities like donning gloves that fire springs to grab and swing enemies, soaking water like a sponge to grow gigantic, and, best of all, just a random Parappa the Rappa reference (among other PlayStation franchises). It looks delightful, and we want to play it. \n\n\nA PlayStation Blog post also states the game features over 80 levels across 6 galaxies, 20 new abilities, and 70 new enemy types. Astro Bot will be available on PlayStation 5 on September 6.

Concord is both the start of a new sci-fi IP for PlayStation and a five-versus-five-player multiplayer shooter coming to PlayStation 5 and PC this year. \nBefore showcasing some third-person shooter gameplay, a vignette setting up the game's world and tone played, and it's here we get a look at its Guardians of the Galaxy-esque action. We see several characters who appear to make up the rag-tag group of heroes we'll be controlling, each with seemingly unique abilities, attempting to capture a special device from someone attempting to escape a rundown locale called Crater City. \nCheck it out for yourself in the Concord cinematic reveal below: \n\n\nAfter this vignette, PlayStation showcased our first look at Concord's gameplay. We get a look at Vale, a sniper, Lennox, a cowboy-esque revolver shooter, Haymar, who uses a magical bow and arrow, Star Child, a brutish shotgun user, and 1-Off, a support character who appears to use support-type elemental moves. The gameplay looks reminiscent of Destiny 2's PvP modes, although brighter in color and more fantastical in visual design. \nCheck out the Concord gameplay reveal for yourself below:\n\n\nAfter the gameplay, some of the Firewalk developers spoke about what players can expect, including deployable gear that can exist throughout a full game (across multiple rounds) and asymmetrical match-ups between players. While the gameplay only showcased five characters, a quick look at the game's roster revealed several more. \nFirewalk says every week when you log on to Concord, you'll be treated to a short cutscene vignette teaching you more about the characters. \nFirewalk and PlayStation will hold a beta on PS5 and PC this July before the game's simultaneous launch on those platforms on August 23, 2024. \nWhat did you think of this Concord reveal?

Given that the game was revealed during another Keighley show, The Game Awards 2023, it wouldn’t be surprising.\nDragon Ball: Sparking Zero is the next entry in what’s known in the West as the Budokai Tenkaichi series (Sparking is the franchise's original Japanese name). The roster is only halfway revealed, but we’ve already seen a number of confirmed fighters from Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball Super, including multiple versions of the same characters. The game has no release window but is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can learn more about the game's new mechanics and features here.",

          "description": "The PlayStation 5 generation is already Sony's most profitable yet, the company has announced. In terms of numbers, the PS5 generation has already earned Sony $106 billion, according to a slide from its \"Game & Network Services Segment\" presentation from PlayStation's two new CEOs, Hideaki Nishino and Hermen Hulst. \nHowever, on that same slide, Sony shows that the PlayStation 4 generation earned $107 billion, which is obviously more than $106 billion. But, the reason Sony is calling the PS5 generation the most profitable one yet is because the PS4 generation is largely complete whereas the PS5 presumably still has years to go. Given it's made $106 billion in roughly four years, it seems Sony is confident it will surpass $107 billion in the coming months or years. \nAs for what Sony is including in its profits, it's the entire gamut of the PS5 generation. This includes the PS5 console itself, associated hardware and accessories, and software, too. It also includes services, like PlayStation Plus, according to the presentation. \nOne of the reasons the PS5 generation might be Sony's most profitable yet is because even though the playerbase is as big as the PS4 – both are sitting at 49 million active consoles as of last month – PS5 players are playing significantly more on their console. The PS5 generation sits at 2.4 billion total gameplay hours while the PS4 sits at 1.4 billon. More playtime likely equates to more spending, which might be one of the reasons the PS5 generation is doing financially as well as it is. \nLife-to-date spending on the PS5 is also higher amongst players than the PS4, too. Across peripherals, services, content/add-ons, and content/full games, the PS4 life-to-date spend is $580 while PS5 players average $731. \nFor more, read about how the PS5 recently broke a sales record for Sony, and then check out Game Informer's list of the top 10 PS5 games. \nWhat are your thoughts on the PlayStation 5 generation so far?

          "description": "Hive Jump 2: Survivors arrives in Steam Early Access today. To celebrate, publisher Midwest Games and developer Graphite Lab have shared an exclusive trailer for the Survivors-like sequel. The first Hive Jump caught our eye way back in 2015 when we named it one of the most promising indie titles on display at PAX West that year before its launch in 2017. The original Hive Jump served as a four-player co-op homage to Super Metroid, but Hive Jump 2: Survivors takes inspiration from a different title: Vampire Survivors.\nThe genre, called \"bullet heaven,\" puts players in the shoes of a single character who eventually builds up to become extremely powerful as the waves of enemies grow more intense. Hive Jump 2: Survivors carries forward the look of its Metroidvania predecessor but from the genre-standard top-down perspective. You take control of a lone survivor of an alien attack who must now face seemingly insurmountable odds to survive. You can customize your loadout and upgrade your jetpack to destroy enemies and escape tough situations.\nThe jetpack also allows you to traverse the levels in ways not available in Vampire Survivors. The Jumpers have specific builds that allow you to cater to your play style, which combines with the upgrades you select before each run. You can play with auto-assist aiming or switch to manual controls. If you can survive 14 rounds, you can challenge big boss battles. As you collect goo from fallen enemies, you can earn better weapons, upgrades, and relics to improve your odds. Meanwhile, amber you find in the field can be traded for permanent upgrades to stats, magnets for auto-scavenging, or even screen-wiping nukes.\nYou can see an exclusive look at the Early Access launch trailer below.\n\n\nHive Jump 2: Survivors launches into Steam Early Access today.

          "description": "Tekken 8’s second DLC fighter, Lidia Sobieska, returns to action in her first gameplay trailer. The Polish politician and karate master will bolster the roster this summer.\nFirst introduced as a DLC fighter in Tekken 7: Fated Retribution, Lidia is the prime minister of Poland and a practitioner of traditional karate. The formal and proud fighter clashes with fellow karate practisioner Jin Kazama in the trailer and humbles the arrogant Reina by dishing out her new Rage Art. \n\n\nLidia follows on the heels of Eddy Gordo as the two revealed Year 1 season pass fighters. Owners of Tekken 8’s Deluxe, Ultimate, or Collector's Editions automatically receive these fighters. Each can also be purchased individually for $7.99. Two more fighters remain in the Year 1 pass, who will be added during the fall and winter\nFor more on Tekken 8, check out our review.",

          "description": "One of the biggest reasons Xbox acquired Activision Blizzard was for the Call of Duty series, a first-person shooter that has dominated the best-selling games list for decades. This would make it the perfect candidate to launch on Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft's gaming subscription service, in order to bring new subscribers in. Black Ops 6 was officially revealed last week, and while it was reported to be in consideration for a Game Pass launch, today, the news was confirmed from Xbox itself. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will launch on Game Pass day one.\nWe don't know much about the game yet, but two live-action teasers have been released so far. The first features a group of people covering the faces of Mount Rushmore with blindfolds that say, \"The truth lies.\" The second, released today, can be seen below.\n\n\nIt features world leaders' black and white camera footage speaking in hushed tones about a grand conspiracy about manufactured wars and the elusive nature of the truth. The trailer ends with the game's full title, along with a reminder that the full reveal will come on June 9, after Xbox's summer showcase.\nFor more Call of Duty, check out our reviews for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III and Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War.",

The last Silent Hill Transmission happened in 2022 and revealed a surprising amount of Silent Hill news including the reveal of the remake of Silent Hill 2, Silent Hill f, a new Silent Hill movie, and more.\nThe post announcing the event reads, \"Consider this your invitation letter to Silent Hill. ✉️ Tune in May 30 at 4 p.m. PDT to our SILENT HILL YouTube channel for the second installment of the #SILENTHILL Transmission where we'll share game updates, a deeper look at the film, and new merch.\"\nThe safe bet is a teaser trailer for the movie and hopefully new details about the Silent Hill 2 remake and Silent Hill f, the latter of which seems like the franchise's next big original entry. Silent Hill Ascension, the online mobile narrative game where players dictated the story choices, also finished up its first season (though the developer may have a different term for it), so it's possible we may learn what's next for that game.",

It met great success and charted in what was then only a burgeoning mobile game ecosystem. Canabalt popularized the infinite runner genre and would ultimately put its designer, Adam Saltsman, on the map.\nNow working under the name of Finji as its creative director, Adam’s rise as a designer as well as his partner’s, Bekah Saltsman, as both a publisher and CEO, has been stunning to watch, especially considering the simplicity of that first big hit.

          "description": "Earlier this year, Game Informer revealed the exclusive first details and screenshots of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed, the video game set after the events of 2023 film, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem. Following that March reveal, developer A Heartful of Games and publisher Outright Games has largely gone quiet. Today, the publisher revealed what players can expect from the Deluxe and Collector's Editions of Mutants Unleashed if they want to splurge on the game when it arrives later this year.\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed allows you to take control of the four turtles in a 3D brawler/platformer for up to two players. The premium editions of the game will provide additional physical goodies for fans of the franchise. The Deluxe Edition includes the game, an exclusive steelbook, four pin badges, four keychains, and an artbook. Meanwhile, the Collector's Edition includes the game, Season Pass, pizza van statue, LED sign, five pin badges, four patches, a mouse mat, notebook, pen, artbook, poster, stickers, and a collector's box. The Deluxe Edition retails for $60, while the Collector's Edition will set you back $200.\nOddly enough, both the Deluxe and Collector's Editions are exclusive to the PlayStation 5 and Switch versions of the game. If you're not planning to experience this title on those systems, but still want to at least play through the game, you're in luck, as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleahsed arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC later this year.\nFor more on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in video games, be sure to read our in-depth feature on the history of the video game franchise here, and if you want something else to look forward to, read a comment from TMNT co-creator Kevin Eastman on the upcoming video game based on The Last Ronin here.",

          "description": "Acquisitions have been rampant in the games industry recently. While the prime example on everyone's mind is likely Xbox's recent acquisition of Activision Blizzard, several have already occurred in 2024. The latest was announced today by Atari, which confirmed it is acquiring its longtime rival, Intellivision.\nAtari announced it has purchased the Intellivision brand and more than 200 games from Intellvision Entertainment. As part of the deal, Intellivision Entertainment will rebrand and continue developing and distributing the Amico game console with a license from Atari to distribute new versions of Intellivision games on the console. Atari will also look to expand digital and physical distribution of legacy Intellivision games, potentially create new games, and explore licensing opportunities. \n\"This was a very rare opportunity to unite former competitors and bring together fans of Atari, Intellivision, and the golden age of gaming,\" chairman and CEO of Atari Wade Rosen said in a press release. \n\"Atari has been a valuable partner and we have every confidence they will be a responsible steward of the storied Intellvision brand,\" CEO of Intellivision Entertainment Phil Adam said. \"We look forward to our expanded collaboration and bringing a broad array of new Atari and Intellivision titles to the Amico and Amico Home family gaming platforms.\"\nAtari has been experiencing a bit of a re-emergence in the public consciousness lately. In addition to other acquisitions, such as Nightdive Studios and Digital Eclipse, Atari has also published well-received games like Mr. Run and Jump and Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration. For more on Atari's outlook and current strategy, be sure to listen to a 2023 episode of All Things Nintendo, which featured an in-depth conversation with Wade Rosen right here.",

Immediately following the presentation, there will be a second livestream to highlight an upcoming game in a \"beloved\" series. Today, the subject of that showcase has been revealed, and surprising no one, it's a new Call of Duty game.\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 6 is a title that might confuse some, seeing as there technically isn't a game titled Black Ops 5. This is because the fifth entry of the sub-series, which launched in 2021, was Black Ops Cold War, temporarily removing the numbered naming convention. The news was announced on social media, but was accompanied by a teaser on YouTube that seems to hint at the events of the game's campaign.\n\n\nThe 40-second clip follows a group of people sneaking onto the top of Mount Rushmore, where they place blindfolds over the eyes of the presidents carved into the mountainside. The first three blindfolds read, \"The truth lies,\" while the fourth features a three-headed wolf logo that was used in the initial redacted teaser of the game.\nThe game will be revealed in full during a presentation on Saturday, June 9, immediately following the Xbox showcase that will start at 10 AM PT/ 1 PM ET. Microsoft is reportedly debating on whether or not the launch the game on Game Pass.\nWhat are you hoping to see from the newest Call of Duty? Let us know in the comments!",

Today, Netflix released the first teaser trailer for Season 4 giving fans their first look at Hemsworth in the role.\n\n\nUnfortunately, Hemsworth doesn’t speak in the brief clip, so we still don’t know how his Geralt voice compares to Cavill’s (or the games, for that matter). But he definitely doesn’t look out of place as the White Wolf and, hopefully, won’t be too much of a distraction in this new season.\nSeason 4 is currently in production in the UK and will be filmed back-to-back with Season 5, which will also be the show's finale. It has no release date but is speculated to premiere in 2025. These last two seasons will cover the three remaining Witcher books: Baptism of Fire, The Tower of the Swallow, and Lady of the Lake. The returning cast includes Anya Chalotra (Yennifer) and Freya Allan (Ciri). \nFor more on The Witcher games, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt got its official PC mod tools this week.
