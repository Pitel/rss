In speaking with developer Night School's founder and director, Sean Krankel, he confirmed that while the original Oxenfree was completed in 16 months, the sequel has taken the studio a full three years to craft. You can definitely see the fruits of the studio's labour, too, with this entry so far proving to be a much more accomplished piece of work in every facet: character models are much more detailed with enhanced animation; environments are brought to life with beautiful colour and lighting; the gameplay feels much smoother and more fluid than before.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Dialing just about every beloved mechanic and detail from the first game up to 11, all while ditching some of Katamari Damacy’s less beloved aspects, it’s no surprise that this entry is the fan favorite. For better and worse, its re-release, We Love Katamari REROLL + Royal Reverie, asks you the question, “If it ain’t broke, why fix it?” With a handful of remixed levels, crisp HD graphics, and a smattering of quality-of-life features, Reroll + does its best to avoid stepping on the original’s toes while bringing the nearly 20-year-old game into the present day in clean, vibrant HD.\nThat new facelift might actually be We Love Katamari Reroll’s most significant addition. That’s not to say that the game didn’t look great back on PS2. In fact, its visuals have aged remarkably well compared to many of its contemporaries. It’s just that compared to modern consoles the PS2’s color palette and graphical capabilities lend a dim, washed-out look to even the brightest, most vibrantly multicolored games. Anyone who played the original back in the day might be shocked to hear that, but even a cursory search or glance at a Let’s Play might surprise you.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Coming in at a further 46,644 copies sold, Nintendo's flagship title is comfortably ahead of Diablo IV, which sold a total of 41,839 across all platforms.\nSpeaking of Diablo IV, however, the Xbox version did not receive a physical release in Japan, so the total of 8,524 that you can see for Xbox in the software charts is purely for the Diablo IV hardware bundle.

          "description": "Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes!\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom made quite a lot of major changes to the formula established in Breath of the Wild. Yes, it still feels very familiar in the sense that you're exploring what is effectively the same environment, but entire regions have been altered, you can now go underground, and your power-ups have completely changed the way you interact with the environment.\nChanges can be both big and small, however, and in our latest video, the lovely Felix has decided to go over 30 subtle differences between the two games that you might not have noticed yourself. Now, we should clarify that none of these are particularly groundbreaking and probably won't have you spitting out your coffee in shock, but they're definitely cool, regardless.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Shaping up well on Switch.\nIt’s not everyday that we demo a game at an event and immediately ask to go back for seconds. The upcoming Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown managed to quickly sink its daggers into us with its punishing but rewarding combat, breathtaking vistas, and flashy animations. So naturally, we couldn’t walk away without taking another stab. This new Metroidvania-style take on the frenetic, spike-trap-dodging platformer is shaping up to be every bit as incredible as the genre it’s taken inspiration from — and all from a team that’s created some of Ubisoft’s best platformers.\nRevealed in the opening moments of the Summer Game Fest 2023 live show, it's been 13 years since the series was last on consoles in The Forgotten Sands. Initial reaction to this new entry was somewhat divided, with some longtime fans disliking its presentation and others absolutely psyched to see the series return to its 2D roots. We went hands-on with a demo build at Ubisoft's Forward event and came away excited to play more.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Immortals Of Aveum is EA and Ascendant Studio's upcoming first-person shooter where, instead of propelling metal at high speeds, you're slinging magic with your hands. We got another good look at said magic slinging at this year's Summer Game Fest, which has seemingly resulted in several reports of it being like a wizardy Call Of Duty. But having played a 30 minute demo of it this week, I reckon it's nothing like COD at all, really. Instead, it's more like Doom / your other retro shooter of choice, but one that carries itself with a frightening seriousness. Sometimes, that's fine. There have been plenty of these smaller sorts of blockbusters that have successfully struck the right balance of silly to serious, with the best ascending to a place of endearment. But so far, Immortals Of Aveum hasn't filled me with hope that it'll join the likes of Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy, or like, The Darkness, as a twinkling beacon of silly fun.\nRead more",

But, come on, look at it. It’s a top-down autoshooter/bullet heaven where defeated beasties drop XP blobs that fuel an escalating series of weapon and stat upgrades, playing out in the whimsical sci-fi/fantasy/corporate nightmare universe inhabited by DRG’s dwarves. \"It’s a mix of Deep Rock Galactic and Vampire Survivors\" is the most apt and succinct description that currently or will ever exist for it. So there.\nAnd yet, being derivative doesn’t always preclude the opportunity for bloody good fun. I’ve played just over three hours of a very early Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor build, and while it’s both missing some parts and could benefit from the odd tweak, it’s already capable of pumping out dopamine as efficiently as any established VampSurvs-alike.\nRead more",

The ceilings are too low, the stairs too narrow, the pipes an afterthought. Jagged Alliance 2 isn't that far gone, but it’s getting there. It gives lots of options for fine control but using them is largely gated behind esoteric, repetitive keyboard shortcuts, which get doubly cumbersome during its awkward transitional moments between real and turn-based movement. \nIt's about leading a group of mercenaries to overthrow the tyrannical queen of a fictional island. A guerrilla warfare sim with great strategic freedom and probably the best turn-based tactical combat ever, all buoyed away from self-seriousness by a campy, irreverent tone and intentionally over the top characters.\nWhat I'm saying is: it's still worth it.\nRead more",

Punters pay to use any ride, they pay for entry, for toilets and cash machines, and for every item you price in every shop.\nThat's as close as it gets to micromanagement, unless you count finely tuning the position of every rock, shrub, and decorative roof panel.

Everywhere you go, there are grey skyscrapers touching the clouds, so they all look like the concrete's puffing on numerous cigarettes. More often than not, cracked paving gives way to an empty lot or a vacuous car park, often with one guy slumped in a little booth ensuring it stays as grey as possible. So, what better way to commemorate grey than with a look at its president, Armored Core 6: Fires Of Rubicon?\nHaving seen a 20 minute presentation of the game at this year's Summer Game Fest, I'd say it struck me as an action game through and through, with the most recognisable bits of Souls soldered onto it when it came to, say, tough battles set to erratic rhythms. Honestly, I would say the hands-off demo is exactly what I expected it to be: lots of fast bits of metal slamming into each other in what was, perhaps, the least surprising FromSoftware reveal I've seen. Here's a piecemeal, slightly chaotic breakdown of the whole experience, coming to you from the frazzled mind of a jetlagged man sitting at a wobbly table.\nRead more",

As you'll have seen from my big preview, the game itself is a 2.5D platformer that mixes 3D character models and environments with sidescrolling action and dramatic camera movements as hero Sargon doles out his suite of special attacks. But as I was playing I became curious whether the team had ever experimented with going all-in on the anime visuals to create a more illustrated look akin to their excellent Rayman games.

Todd Howard wasn't even wearing a leather jacket, which sort of felt like seeing Scooby Doo without his dog collar. Like, I'd still know it's Scooby Doo, but it wouldn't look right, you know? \nAnyway, all this is to say that the presentation was long. If you're still interested in finding out what was revealed but don't have the time to watch it, however, then good news! I have created a shorter video that highlights the 12 most exciting new details Bethesda showcased as part of the Starfield direct. That's cool, isn't it?

This is a great price for a card that makes a brilliant upgrade from something like a GTX 1060, RX 570 or RX 580, providing significantly better rasterised performance (up to 2x as fast) while also providing those features that weren't available a few generations ago.

Come and watch the reveal trailer below. Honestly, why does every VR living room look the same in these game reveals? \nRead more",

In brief, the game looks rather lovely! If… too lovely. I worry there's a big catch somewhere and I can't put my finger on it.\nRead more",

There have been reports that The Lost Crown's gameplay reveal trailer (which currently sits across five separate YouTube channels) is continuing to rack up significantly higher dislikes than likes since it got announced, and many seem to have taken issue with the trailer's accompanying rap song and that it doesn't look like a \"true\" Prince Of Persia game, whatever the heck that means. It's disappointing to see a game instantly dismissed like this, not least because, as someone who's actually been to Ubisoft Montpellier to play the damn thing, this is arguably the most exciting Prince Of Persia game in years - and certainly more interesting than the troubled Sands Of Time Remake. \nRead more",

It remains unconcerned with telling groundbreaking stories or delivering breathtaking cinema in its fights - it doesn't care.

I'd got my pass, got seated in the theatre and finally had a chance to take in my surroundings. There were lots of folks, obviously, either excitedly chatting or awkwardly swivelling their legs to let people pass. Many wore Xbox jerseys. One man had an Xbox logo shaved into his head. A photographer asked our section to smile, so I managed the pained grin of a British person who encounters a stranger on a walk, the bunching of my cheeks pulling my lips into a curl. Meanwhile, those dressed in their Microsoft jerseys crossed their forearms and hollered.\nThe countdown flashed up on screen and the crowd started chanting, \"five, four, three!\", and for a second it felt like I was the only one who hadn't supped from a bowl of green liquid or beat my chest to the rhythm of \"Play it day one on Xbox Game Pass\". The crowd was on another plane of existence and, for brief moments, I was there with them. At other times I felt the physical fatigue of the trailer train more acutely than ever.\nRead more",

After delighting us with Edo-period Japan in Shadow Tactics: Blades Of The Shogun and the rootin' tootin' tales of the Wild West in Desperados 3, Mimimi have taken a firm step outside their comfort zone with the high seas island-hopping of Shadow Gambit, offering up an altogether different approach to their tried and tested stealth antics. \nAs you might have guessed from the name, its eponymous crew aren't bound by the laws of reality in this latest tactical outing, and their extensive suite of magic abilities really open up the playing field for some creative takedowns. But the canvas on which you're painting these elaborate murders has morphed since the days of Desperados 3, with its handful of islands now offering multiple points of entry, a myriad of different missions and objectives and - for the first time ever - repeat visits to the same locations. It's quite the sea change from Mimimi's previous work, but rest assured: the crown jewels of the Mimimi stealth strategy experience certainly haven't been lost to Davey Jones' locker in the process. If nothing else, this is the most fun I've had with a Mimimi game, period - and I cannot wait to dive back in properly when it launches on August 17th. \nRead more",

An improvement on the creators found in previous Bethesda games, there's nothing here that looks particularly innovative compared to other open-world games of this ilk.

The DS title was Ace Attorney director Shu Takumi’s shot to create something new, a “different kind of mystery” from the courtroom battles of Phoenix Wright and friends.\nThough received well, sales seem mixed; it was a best-selling Nintendo DS game in Japan the week of its release, but Capcom would later note it struggled. All of this helped build, at least in my perception, a cult-classic vibe around it. It wasn’t the most popular DS game, but those in the know who dug the DS highly valued it.\nSo that's where we find Ghost Trick now, as it's getting a revival on modern consoles. A demo is currently available, containing the first two chapters. And alongside a chance to play that section a…",

The latest update for the game now makes Naughty Dog's masterpiece compatible with the Valve handheld.\nUpdate 1.1.0 for the game also comes with a ton of tweaks and changes. Looking at the patch notes on Steam shows a healthy list of fixes. Chief among these are important optimizations for CPU and GPU performances, improvements to texture loading, as well as a number of glitch repairs and bug fixes.\nWhen The Last of Us Part 1 was released on PC back in March, the game was plagued with more than its fair share of issues. This led to a series of negative reviews on Steam, as players were understandably upset about the state of the anticipated remake. Several updates have been released since launch, fixing around 40 bugs and glitches, so it's in much better shape these days, at least.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxVyuE2Nn_w\nEasily considered one of the best releases of the PS3 era, the original The Last of Us was a tour de force in video game development and storytelling. A slick remaster was released for PS4 in 2014, while the smash-selling sequel launched in 2020. The Last of Us Part II did split the crowd somewhat, but it was still an impactful game from Naughty Dog.\nDespite the series' reputation, some were skeptical that the studio was remaking something that was barely a decade old and already looked stunning even on previous-gen hardware. That said, the remake enjoyed a positive reception, and the HBO adaptation was highly praised indeed. In short, The Last of Us, as a brand, is doing very well for itself, and now you can even play Part I on the go!\nThe Last of Us Part I is available now on PS5 and PC.\nThe post The Last of Us Part I is now Steam Deck verified appeared first on Destructoid.",

Confirmed as a \"collaboration\" between Feral Games and Crystal Dynamics, the collection (which consists of two spinoff games featuring Tomb Raider hero Lara Croft) was delayed, seemingly indefinitely. But now it's back.\nThe latest news comes straight from a new trailer released by Feral Interactive, which definitively announces a June 29, 2023 release date. While the Switch version won't have any major extra features, it does still have four-player local co-op, among all of the other benefits of playing on Switch.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wlq-VxMgza0\nWhat even is the Lara Croft Collection that's coming to Switch?\nAs a reminder, this collection deals with the two isometric action romps:\nLara Croft and the Guardian of Light (2010)\nLara Croft and the Temple of Osiris (2014)\nWe have reviews for both! And yes, one of them is over a decade old at this point. If you have local folks available, $24.99 isn't a bad price point for what will essentially amount to a weekend of isometric action fun. Each game will last you roughly five hours.\nComparison shopping for the Lara Croft Collection\nYou can find the collection on the Nintendo eShop now for $24.99.\nYou can pick up both of those games, as well as \"every other Tomb Raider title ever released on PC\" on Steam for $28.43 until June 26.\nOn Xbox, the Temple of Osiris + the season pass is on sale for under $5, and on the PSN the Temple of Osiris is available for $19.99.\nGiven the delistings of either game on some platforms (including iOS), the Switch port is making strides in the preservation department.\nThe post Lara Croft Collection is coming to Switch after 2021 announcement appeared first on Destructoid.",

Amid all of the frankly insane devices and creations we've seen the community come up with, this new wave of videos showcases another creative element: music.\nHow the community is creating music in Tears of the Kingdom\nWhat the community is essentially doing is using stakes and lasers [beam emitters] (or other things) to create musical notes, which are then strung together through specific stake placements and item manipulation. Given how easy it is to head to a Zonai device dispenser, amass stakes, and save/quit in a field while experimenting, anyone who is willing can give it a shot.\nCheck out this short tutorial from Twitter user bran8bit.\nhttps://twitter.com/bran8bit/status/1667539615413334017\nSince then, the community at large took this knowledge and ran with it. Take this invention from Twitter user kabukichi00: they use an existing in-game platform to perfectly recreate the ever-present \"Song of Storms\" track.\nhttps://twitter.com/kabukichi00/status/1668898001165877255\nAnother clip from kody_botw shows off how players can manually create music by lifting a laser cannon up with Ultrahand, and even play along with the background track.\nhttps://twitter.com/kody_botw/status/1668587177973026817\nThen there's this clip from noteabletony, who goes a step further and gets a minecart involved.\nhttps://twitter.com/noteabletony/status/1668350921158320159\nWelp, I still have more Street Fighter 6 and Diablo 4 to play, but this is my evening sorted!

While not all that much is known regarding the narrative and gameplay mechanics, the title coming from the producers of Persona 3, Persona 4, and Persona 5 suggests that we'll get a wild, highly stylized adventure starring a cast of easily shippable and cosplay friend characters, and mucho dungeon crawling.\nIt's definitely one of the most surprising and exciting reveals of Summer Game Fest, and while its development probably means Persona 6 is on the back burner for the time being, Metaphor: ReFantazio is already turning heads with its dynamic, action-packed, and legitimately breathless trailer.

Whether you use the PC gaming storefront on desktop, mobile, or Steam Deck, you'll have noticed a few differences lately.\nA short video highlights the new features that have been implemented. In a nutshell, the general layout has been given a \"fresh coat of paint.\" Not so much that it doesn't look like Steam anymore. But is a bit different.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8jv24NjOWQ\nValve has also made notifications \"richer and more useful.\" Make of that what you will. You'll also notice the in-game overlay has been tweaked and now boasts more options for \"better customization\". One of the newest things to be added is a Notes feature which, as the name suggests, allows you to take notes during play. You can even pin it so it stays on top of your game in case you need to refer to it. There have also been some improvements to controller experiences as well, which adds a gamepad overlay and additional \"virtual menus\".\nIf you use Steam on Mac or Linux machines, the new update also enables hardware acceleration for these versions of the client, which should lead to a more responsive experience. That's according to the video, at least.\nThis latest update has been rolled out to all versions of Steam, including the official app. If you want to take a deep dive into the laundry list of changes that have been made recently, you can check out the full patch notes on the Steam website.\nThe post The new Steam client update looks funky, comes with new features appeared first on Destructoid.",

As reported by RPGSite, a banner for a \"Star Ocean The Second Story R\" was first discovered on the support site of IP owner Square Enix.\nOriginally released for PlayStation in 1998, Star Ocean: The Second Story is, as the name suggests, the second entry in the action-RPG series, which won over fans with its sci-fi/fantasy storytelling, myriad paths and conclusions, and very heavy emphasis on dating mechanics between multiple characters, allowing players to essentially dictate both narrative and gameplay through the pairing (or not) of relationships.\nThe \"R\" in the new banner suggests that this popular release may be in line for the remake/remaster treatment, though obviously, Square Enix is yet to speak on the discovery. Back in 2019, the publisher released the similarly titled Star Ocean First Departure R on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, which was itself a remaster of the PlayStation Portable (PSP) port of the first game in the series.

So form a queue, ladies. The preview then describes Shadows of the Damned as \"A nonstop-action love story taking you straight through the deepest depths of Hell\". Sweet.\n\"Coming to all current platforms,\" concludes the preview, before adding \"Probably.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THS60cC3768&t=270s&ab_channel=GrasshopperArchives\nElsewhere in the Grasshopper Direct, community manager James Mountain seemingly returns from the dead, while fellow CM Maddie Copp turns up cosplaying as No More Heroes' notorious Bad Girl. It also looks really hot under those studio lights. Of course, \"Suda51\" himself puts in an appearance, dazzlingly dressed in a lucha mask and green suit, reminiscent of Saints Row villain Killbane. Suda seemed a lot bigger and much more American than you may recall, but that's just your brain playing tricks on you, as it was definitely him.

FromSoftware has been steadily working on successful Souls and Souls-like games, but the first Armored Core is one of its oldest titles. And now, years later, FromSoftware is returning to mech action with Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon. And the series is certainly back.\nWe were invited to view a hands-off demo of a stage in Armored Core VI, where the player's mercenary needs to infiltrate and take command of a catapult held by a hostile faction. This means flying in and doing a whole lot of blasting. The progression still looks to be very Armored Core: it opens with a briefing, with lots of intel and screens, and then you're into the thick of it.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlSfr6Wa5sc\nBridging the gap\nIt's going t…",

While the video mostly centers on poster boy Luke, (portrayed by Johnny Junkers), and a busy day in the life of a street fighter, we also get appearances from Chun-Li (Caytie Cosplay), Zangief (Bane Armstrong), Cammy (Vamplettes), and Kimberly (Jahara Jayde - No Pout).\nD Piddy themselves also takes to the floor as the tonic-gushing vigilante, Jamie.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjR_iqxgZbY\nLuke's day is busy enough, but it's thrown into full chaos by the arrival of Juri Han (Jane Sin), which leads to a brief throwdown between pals. Additionally, Manon (Kitty Kaboom) does a spot of couture shopping, and even Sakura (Lucky Lai) pops her head up to remind Capcom she needs to be added as DLC. The whole shebang is backed by the official Street Fighter 6 theme song \"Not on the Sidelines\" by Rocco 808 & Randy Marx.\nCheck it out, a lot of wonderful, creative talent on display.\nYou can keep up to speed on more of D Piddy's projects over on their official Twitter.\nStreet Fighter 6 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. Be sure to check out our newly launched and ever-growing guide hub for hints and tips on all of the game’s main modes, as well as my thoughts on who needs to join the roster post-launch.\nThe post Rad Street Fighter 6 cosplay video sees World Warriors duke it out appeared first on Destructoid.",

As with its predecessor, death is only beginning, and each fallen knight will be replaced by the next in their bloodline, many of whom carry their own unique quirks and abilities, known in-game as \"Traits\".\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiHeilA8k4U&ab_channel=CellarDoorGames\nAdded to the sequel are several new features, including the Metroidvania-type \"Heirlooms\", allowing access to certain out-of-reach areas, and an expanded narrative that runs beyond the original run and into several New Game+ efforts.

The Animation Digital Network will be co-producing. Right now, we have a short teaser trailer of the prisoner sitting on a pile of corpses attempting to spark their head back to life. This comes complete with the sound of someone flicking a cheap lighter.\nhttps://twitter.com/motiontwin/status/1668982072797454338?s=20\nThat’s not much to go on, admittedly, but despite being a roguelite, Dead Cells has a lot of lore to draw from. It also has a lot of memorable characters to draw from, like, uh, that one lady who dies. Or maybe that guy who… Crap.\nI’m going to be honest with you. I picked up Dead Cells for their Return to Castlevania DLC, and I loved the heck out of it. Once I finished with Return to Castlevania, it was my intention to continue on through the rest of the content. I guess it was a busy time for me because I just didn’t do that. When was that? March? Oh, yeah. I did 12 reviews that month. That wasn’t a very good idea.\nHowever, my time spent with it does leave me convinced that it could be adapted into a very watchable animated series. No word on whether or not you have to start from the beginning if you fail to watch the series from start to finish.\nThe Dead Cells animated series will arrive sometime in 2024.

BPM Rush will task players with battling wave after wave of increasingly tough opponents, with bonus points awards for synching the battle to the beat. Stay on your toes, however, as the BPM will increase with each and every wave, and only the most rhythmic melee warriors will be able to keep the pace in this unique-looking endurance test.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dU394xpvU\nThe second mode Power Up! Tower Up! is a variant of Hi-Fi Rush's Rhythm Tower mode, and adds a slew of power-ups and bugs to the battle. Chai will be able to select from a variety of buffs and nerfs between rounds at the cost (or increase of) their score multipliers and other bonuses. Essentially, it is up to the player to increase their powers in exchange for a higher score, or to conversely reduce their own abilities for the big, big numbers.\nIn addition to the two modes, new challenges arrive that will reward players with clothing for Chai and Korsica, new poses and filters for Photo Mode, and all-new special attacks that see an assist from robo-friendos CNMN and Smidge. Get by with a little help from you friends indeed.

If you managed to check out, and enjoy, the showcases that have been broadcasting recently, you may well be excited for SGF's return in 2024. Actually, the event is even technically over yet, as Annapurna's showcase is still to come.\nNot only is Keighley eager to announce that Summer Game Fest will be back in June of next year, he goes on to say that this year's event was \"record-setting.\" Not quite certain what that means, but it likely refers to the amount of people who attended the event, both in person and online. Given the dry spell from gaming conventions over the past two or three years, it wouldn't be surprising to see the likes of SGF see an uptick in attendees.\nhttps://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1668638357608628225\nCurrently, there are no details about the 2024 showcases, other than it will obviously be hosted by Keighley himself. There will also be the return of Play Days from studio iam8bit, but again, details won't be announced until further down the line.\nSummer Game Fest 2023 saw a lot of content from a variety of studios, publishers, and industry experts. Trailers from the likes of Alan Wake 2, Mortal Kombat 1, Marvel's Spider-Man 2, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, and lots more were on display. There was also the Day of the Dev event, hosted by iam8bit and Double Fine, which gave indie studios the opportunity to showcase what they've been working on.\nWith E3 being cancelled this year — perhaps never to return — that leaves the space open for SGF and other expos to continue their dominance of the summer period.

Frankly, this wasn't going to happen, not when there is so much cash to be made, but at least those who were concerned can rest easy that they will be revisiting The Dark Hour with Messrs Makoto, Junpei, Mitsuru, and company.\nFirst leaked during Summer Game Fest, before being officially announced during Sunday's Xbox Game Showcase, Persona 3 Reload is a full remake of the 2006 PS2 classic. While fans have been craving this title for some title, the hype has been somewhat quashed by the revelation that Reload will not feature any of the content from expanded edition Persona 3 FES, nor the Persona 3 Portable release, which included the much-loved female protagonist, known to the community as \"FemC\".\nPersona 3 Reload will launch in early 2024 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

As such, Microsoft cannot complete its purchase of Activision Blizzard until the case reaches Federal Court in August.]\nThe United States Federal Trade Commission has requested that U.S. place an injunction preventing Microsoft from closing its proposed purchase of publisher Activision Blizzard before the FTC's antitrust lawsuit, set to take place this August.\nDespite the legal opposition from the commission, as well as the approval rejection from the UK, The FTC believes Microsoft fully intends to go ahead and complete the $68.7 billion merger, and that \"they may consummate the proposed acquisition at any time\". The FTC filed suit against Microsoft back in December 2022, but the case is still yet to be heard in court.\nThe FTC has asked for an injunction preventing the sale from taking place be filed no later than June 15, and that said injunction remain in place until the court makes its decision later this summer.\nIn a statement to GamesIndustry.biz, Microsoft president Brad Smith writes: \"We welcome the opportunity to present our case in federal court. We believe accelerating the legal process in the U.S. will ultimately bring more choice and competition to the market.\"\nThe FTC continues to build its case against the proposed sale ahead of August's hearing. The commission is expected to present arguments that Microsoft's ownership of the Call of Duty and World of Warcraft studio will create something of a monopoly within the industry, limiting player choice and confining popular brands to MS own platforms. Microsoft has repeatedly denied that this is the intent behind its proposed purchase.\nPretrial briefs are expected to take place in July, with the court officially opening August 2.\nThe post (Update) FTC requests injunction to prevent Microsoft/Activision sale from closing early appeared first on Destructoid.",

Diablo 3 released in 2012 with over a billion unique build possibilities across all of its classes. Hit ARPG Path of Exile has been constantly adding new abilities via its unique skill gem system for almost ten years.\nAs we began to learn more about Diablo 4 leading up to its release, just one week ago, it quickly became apparent we'd once again get a massive amount of potential builds.

          "description": "An added golden epilogue\nIt's been just over a year since Square Enix released its HD-2D turn-based tactics game Triangle Strategy. And now, fans who have put some time into the tactics can get a little bonus for their trouble.\nA Version 1.1.0 update has rolled out for Triangle Strategy on available platforms, adding a few different features. For those who want to re-experience the big events of Triangle Strategy, there are replay options for both chapters and story battles.\nBut also arriving as part of the update is an Extra Story option. This bonus chapter appears on the title screen, but only after you've completed the Serenoa route of Triangle Strategy.\nIf you haven't played the game or have only seen it through once, you might not be aware of this route. The Serenoa route is Triangle Strategy's \"golden route,\" where the protagonist Serenoa finds an option to resolve all the great mysteries and conflicts that surround the ongoing war.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nhTJ-Evv_U\nTo get that, you'll need to make certain choices throughout the game, and be ready to see them through. Doing so will unlock this new extra chapter, which serves as a golden epilogue of sorts.\nReturn to the battlefield\nAlongside content updates, Square Enix also says that some battle adjustments have been made for repeat playthroughs. Other options have been added, that all seem to make repeat playthroughs a bit smoother to run through. It's nice, considering many players who are going for the golden route are likely doing so on a second run.\nI'm happy to see Triangle Strategy get this update, though. It's remained a memorable, solid tactics experience both on the Switch and other platforms. Any sort of follow-up or sequel speculation aside, I'm happy to see the Triangle Strategy team is being given the room to make these post-launch updates so far out, as little treats for fans who dug this far into the game.\nThe post Triangle Strategy update adds an extra story chapter appeared first on Destructoid.",

Update!” hits on July 5 and adds two new game modes accessible after players have completed the main game. You’ll access these features by using a new arcade cabinet that appears in the hideout. \n\n\nThe first is BPM Rush, in which players fight waves of enemies as the beats per minute gradually rise with each level, eventually topping out at 200 BPM. The second new mode is Power Up! Tower Up!, a remixed version of Rhythm Tower that tasks players to take a completely underpowered Chai and gradually build him with randomized upgrades by climbing floors and tackling waves of foes. \nThis update also introduces new photo mode features such as stickers, filters, and poses, new clothing unlocks for Chai and Korsica, fresh 808 looks and accessories, and special attacks that incorporate CNMN and Smidge. \nHi-Fi Rush is available on Xbox Series X/S and PC.

Between runs, you’ll spend hard-earned loot upgrading your town HQ, and unlocking new stores while improving the traits of your lineage of warriors to raise your odds of surviving subsequent runs. \n\n\nWe awarded Rogue Legacy 2 a 9 out of 10 in our review, with former editor John Carson writing, \"Despite my nitpicks, every new discovery unveiled, skills obtained, and boss defeated wipes away any grief and replaces it with deep satisfaction.

          "description": "Over the past few years, Capcom has steadily been sending their beloved Ace Attorney series to modern consoles. Today, it announced it is completing the collection with Apollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy, out in early 2024.\nThe collection includes Apollo Justice Ace Attorney, originally released on the DS, as well as the series' two 3DS games, Dual Destinies and Spirit of Justice. While the games can be played in isolation, they're collectively understood to be entries four, five, and six in the Ace Attorney series, following the events of the original Phoenix Wright trilogy on the DS. The collection will include remastered HD visuals of each of the games while preserving their original styles. This means Apollo Justice Ace Attorney will still be 2D, but the latter two will feature updated 3D sprites.\n\n\nThe Ace Attorney series follows defense lawyers Phoenix Wright and Apollo Justice as they're tasked to defend people accused of murder. The Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Trilogy was brought to modern consoles in 2019, and The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles (a prequel series set during the industrial revolution) came to modern consoles in 2021. Today's newest collection means all of the series' mainline games will be available to play on modern consoles.\nApollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy will be available early next year on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC.",

We then see her doodle is a cute vehicle to break the bad news, followed by a more formal message from the development team stating...\nIt is with a heavy heart that we must further postpone the release of Pragmata.\nOur team is currently hard at work making the best game that we possibly can, but we need more time. We will continue to do our best to ensure that the final product is one that is worthy of your patience.\nThank you for your continued support.\n-The Pragmata Development Team\nPragmata was first announced in 2020, and we still know next to nothing about it. So far, we've seen that some kind of catastrophe has befallen Earth, and the game unfolds in a \"near-future dystopian world on the moon,\" according to Capcom.

While she knocks out one guard by jamming the butt of her gun into the back of their skull, there are three more ahead that she needs to use her axolotl-like companion Nix to distract. The U.I. gives her some options to target guards for an attack, but instead, she sends Nix to press a switch, moving a crate her way to hide behind.

There's also a look at some of Basim's special powers.\nCheck out the gameplay footage below.\n\n\nNotably, the Assassin's Creed series shifting away from this style of game was, in fact, due to franchise fatigue. 2017's Assassin's Creed Origins took the series towards an RPG slant, furthered by Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Valhalla. But all old things are new again, and fatigue gives way to nostalgia. It'll be interesting to see how and if this throwback lands when it comes out.\nYou can also check out a new trailer for the game below.\n\n\nAssassin's Creed Mirage will be released on October 12.",

Announced during today's Ubisoft Forward, the series-spanning mashup shooter will enter into a brief open beta period later this month, from June 21-23. The event will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. \nXDefiant will properly release this summer. The game is free-to-play, and while there's no release date yet, Ubisoft did give us a glimpse into what content will be available in the game's early days. Firstly, everything from the beta periods will be available at launch. This includes 14 maps, 5 modes, and 24 weapons. The game's five factions (Deadsec, Libertad, Phantoms, Echelon, and Cleaners) will be available, as well, though you'll have to unlock Deadsec through gameplay. We also got a quick look at some of the content coming in the game's first year. There will be 12 new weapons and 12 new maps, which is a pretty significant expansion on the game's existing content, but also four entirely new factions. The only clue to each new faction is a series of silhouettes and an XDefiant logo with a different design.\nFor more on XDefiant, check out our preview, or if you want to see some gameplay, our episode of New Gameplay Today.",

The RDA has expanded to the western frontier led by John Mercer, who abducts you and other Na’vi to groom you into weapons to use against your own people. After being placed into cryosleep, you awaken 15 years later to a new world and must catch up on what’s happened to stop the RDA. That involves reconnecting with other tribes and learning what it means to be Na’vi again to regain their trust.\n\n\nThe game is a first-person adventure where you’ll wield native weapons like bows and human firearms while also riding atop native beasts. The open-world game features several settlements and clans that you'll travel to using bonded mounts, both ground-based and flying, which you can name, feed, and customize. Frontiers of Pandora also supports 2-player online co-op. \nWe also got a long-awaited release date: December 7. Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

As an escaped android with a malfunctioning body, you'll have to gather a crew, command a ship, and do what it takes to stay alive. If you want to keep an eye out for future updates, the game already has a Steam page.\nIf this game is anything like its predecessor, we're all in for a treat. We were big fans of the original Citizen Sleeper, with its inspired story and narrative mechanics leading to our reviewer calling it \"a game I'll be thinking about for years to come.\" It also scored a spot on our Top Ten Games of 2022.",

To set things right, you’ll travel back to key moments in the past where your actions have a Butterfly Effect on Avalon’s future. Hopping between the past and an ever-changing present shows off the game's complex choice-driven storytelling and reactive role-playing, as you'll meet various versions of characters depending on how you tinker with time. \n\n\nThe game is described as featuring a “deep, narrative-driven world” while the action unfolds in the form of first-person gunplay using steam-powered firearms as well as time-bending technology, such as reversing the time-flow of objects. \nClockwork Revolution is being developed by inXile Entertainment, makers of the Wasteland and A Bard’s Tale series, and is coming “in due time” to Xbox Series X/S and PC. It will launch on Game Pass.",

The accompanying voiceover suggests that the story involves the lead character traveling to an area of Eora called the Living Lands – a part of the world established in the Pillars game as a diverse island to the north characterized by strange weather patterns and strange creatures. The player character arrives as an envoy of the emperor of Aedyr, to look into rumors of an unnatural plague.\nAvowed is coming to Xbox and PC in 2024. Check out the full trailer below.",

The footage of the game points to it being a total, from-the-ground-up remake, which might explain why the recent re-release of Persona 3 on modern platforms was somewhat underwhelming. The game is set to release in early 2024 and will be available on Xbox Game Pass.",

A young woman pays a visit to inquire about a dangerous monster, which attempts to ambush her until she retaliates by weaving a seemingly magical web to subdue it. There's no gameplay, and the trailer's description describes South of Midnight as a \"fantastical and macabre third-person action-adventure set in the American Deep South.\"\n\n\nSouth of Midnight has no release window, but it’s coming to PC and Xbox Series X/S and will launch on Game Pass.",

The game is being developed by Massive Entertainment, a Ubisoft studio known for making The Division and The Division 2. The cinematic reveal trailer didn't show any gameplay, instead relying on cgi cutscenes to set the mood of the world, showing a young woman on the run from a bounty hunter. You can watch it for yourself below.\n\n\nThe description of the trailer on YouTube offers some more concrete details about the game.\n\"Experience the first-ever open world Star Wars game, set between the events of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi,\" the description says. \"Explore distinct planets across the galaxy, both iconic and new. Risk it all as Kay Vess, an emerging scoundrel seeking freedom and the means to start a new life, along with her companion Nix. Fight, steal, and outwit your way through the galaxy’s crime syndicates as you join the galaxy’s most wanted.\"\nWhile the new title isn't out until 2024, we'll be learning more about it at Ubisoft's showcase tomorrow.

The trailer (but not the full game, presumably) stars Richard Ayoade of The IT Crowd fame as Dave commiserating about the age of heroes being over and the age of agriculture being the future. In a twist, however, it is revealed that Ayoade's character is a giant fending off heroes who are trying to invade his home.\n\n\nFrom there an action sequence begins with a hero outrunning the giant Ayoade. It is revealed in the end that the hero has defeated the giant by show of them sitting on his shattered glasses. The trailer's description on YouTube shares that this new entry will continue to take place in Albion.\nNo release date was revealed, but the game will be available on Game Pass day one.",

This open-world adventure gives players the power to remove textures from the environment itself to slap on other objects, opening the door for some inventive puzzle-solving.\nAs Ruffy, you’re the chosen one with the power of Swap. That means you can mix and match elements of the world as you see fit. Need to climb up a mountain? Rip that patch of vines off a wall and slap it over a waterfall to create an instant climbing path. Change the time of day by switching out the sun and moon. Turn a heavy stone into a floating platform by replacing it with a wood texture. Copy and paste are your best friends and seemingly allow for a number of creative solutions to Riverside's many challenges. \n\n\nIn addition to a primary story campaign, you’ll tackle sidequests given by the colorful residents. Speaking of color, the world sports a great-looking papercraft art direction. Thankfully, we shouldn’t have to wait terribly long to explore Ruffy and the Riverside since it launches later this year for Switch and PC (with other consoles to be announced later).",

Players guide three very different characters – a samurai, a Kodama spirit, and a cat – on a journey to save Japan from invading Oni. As the samurai Takeshi and the much smaller Kodoma, you’ll hack apart undead soldiers and supernatural foes from Japanese mythology. As the cat, platforming and stealth are the names of the game, as you’ll avoid enemies such as one, particularly toothy and terrifying-looking demon. \nThe Spirit of the Samurai has been in the works for a few years by developer Digital Mind Games and arrives in 2024 for PC.",

But all is not what it seems in the world of Varn...\nThe ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for the PC version of the first game of the Might and Magic series: Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Two modes are supported:\nThe original look and feel of the game (sound, which in the original consisted of merely the occasional beep, is not supported)\nA ScummVM-exclusive enhanced mode, which uses the interface of the later Xeen games, including niceties such as better character screens, automapping, and sound effects. It also integrates the impressive \"Might and Magic 1 Graphics Overhaul Mod\", which provides better in-game map and monster graphics. The xeen.cc file is required from Might and Magic: IV or Might and Magic: World of Xeen.\nBoth modes allow saving your game anywhere outside of combat via the ScummVM Global Main Menu (unlike the original game that only saved a single roster when checking into an inn). So make sure you save regularly, just in case you encounter problems.\nHelp us test both game modes by grabbing a daily build and adding mm.dat to the same folder as your game files. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way.\nNow, go forth, and discover the true secrets of the game that started the long running epic fantasy series!\n>",

          "description": "As I write this many of the development team and other members of the community are busy having fun at a meet-up in Brussels. Not me though, I’m stuck here doing a release. We’ve been busy refactoring quite a lot of the underlying code to make future changes easier, but along the way we’ve found and fixed a few more bugs and quality of life improvements that we figured were worth releasing sooner than whenever 14.0 comes along. Notably, OpenTTD will now automatically disable hardware acceleration if it detects that the last crash happened while initialising the graphics driver. While hardware acceleration works well for the vast majority of people, it causes crashes for people that then required command line arguments or manual config file editing to get it to work. This should be a better solution for those users. Additionally, there is a change to the default mouse mode on Linux to improve experience when dragging the map (and often to match expected behaviour in other games). As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. While you’re at it, have you seen the post about the upcoming addition of a automated opt-in survey to OpenTTD 14? If you have opinions, we’d like to hear them! Details here. Download Changelog Bug tracker",
