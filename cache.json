Of course, the company goes much further back with an assortment of previous business ventures, with the original and most famous being Hanafuda and playing cards. It would eventually establish itself as a leader in that field in Japan, but some interesting research suggests that the very early history of the company may be due some revision.\nIn an article posted by Marcus Richert on Tech Radar, they explore Nintendo's founding year of 1889, which is the most commonly agreed period of Fusajiro Yamauchi creating the company. Their research suggests that the company was actually formed in 1892, three years later, and it seems there's documentary evidence to back that up. Reichert found historical records that consistently show 1892 as the founding year of the company, with the earlier date only emerging in records and popular perception decades later:\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Previously, the game was slated to hit some time this year, but it looks like pizza parties in the sun while kicking shell will be on the menu for many fans of the four turtles.\nTo accompany this announcement, IGN has shared some exclusive gameplay from Shredder's Revenge. The video shows the game's first two stages — Channel 6 Studios and the Streets of New York. TMNT fans will be very familiar with these, as Channel 6 is the studio where April O'Neil works in the 1987 cartoon. it looks like the perfect evolution of the classic games, with attacks reminiscent of those from the arcades, as well as brand-new combos and special attacks.\nKeen fans will no doubt recognise something very special if they hear past the incredible music — the original voice cast from the 1987 cartoon has returned to voice the turtles. Cam Clarke (Leonardo), Townsend Coleman (Michelangelo), Barry Gordon (Donatello), and Rob Paulsen (Raphael) are all here, and together, they're helping Dotemu and Tribute Games' vision to recreate the feel of that very show. Let's hope Renae Jacobs, Peter Renaday, and others can also join the rest of the gang for a big ol' reunion.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "This weekend I managed to watch, after recommendations from every corner of the internet, Our Flag Means Death, a TV show that is perhaps the most literal expression of the 'be gay, do crime' meme yet committed to celluloid. This got me thinking about pirate games again, as I do every 12-18 months or so. Everyone likes the pirate concept, and there is, I think, a collective urge to make piratey games. There are a bunch of them, after all. But there hasn't yet been one that I think provides exactly what I want from a pirate game.\nRead more",

It's a standalone handheld console that fits into the palm of your hand (yes, even palms as small as mine), and is controlled via a d-pad, two face buttons and its unique, standout feature, the crank. But inside this dinky yellow wafer, the spirit of PC gaming has never been stronger. It's there in its eclectic first season of indie games, a series of 24 titles that not only delight in the minutiae of its hardware but are delivered weekly for free in batches of two direct to your console over Wi-Fi. It's there in the openness of the Playdate ecosystem, too, where you can make your own Playdate games in its browser-based Pulp creation tool, download the source code, share it with friends (or sell it) and sideload it onto your Playdate all in a matter of minutes. Heck, Panic have even added the ability to stream from it, capture video and screenshots from it, and hook it up to an external monitor, keyboard or controller via its Playdate Mirror app.\nIt's a surprisingly versatile bit of kit, the Playdate, and one I feel will enchant and enthral anyone who has a deep and inherent love of all things games. Sure, there's every possibility it may end up as another Ouya-style disaster show, but if you've ever longed for something like Lexaloffle's Pico-8 platform to be more than just a 'fantasy console', then the Playdate is exactly what you've been waiting for. \nRead more",

Once every turn he could blink across the map, moving twice as far as he can with a regular action point, plopping him right behind a pesky Cultist’s cone of suppressing fire. It was both effective and efficient, but the real fireworks began whenever I clicked teleport strike, which repositioned him while also savaging several enemies in sequence with his power sword. He was simultaneously my initiator and my (almost) one-man clean up crew, ready to be rallied by a cry from my Justicar whenever his AP tank ran empty. I almost felt sorry for the cultists. \nI’ve played a curated, two hour slice of Warhammer 40K: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters, and I’m keen to play more. As speedy as my sword boy felt in those moments, though, at other times I felt compelled to move forward at a crawl.

Luckily I can link this to FixFox thematically, as a big exciting incident for the story involves waking up a man who was stuck in a cryopod. Around that, you, a fox called Vix, fix things in a post-apocalyptic sci-fi future where your tools are bananas and stamps.\nI was several hours into FixFox before I left it, and discovered it was much larger than I expected. It's paradoxically cosy and friendly even as its world is vast and strange. I had some minor annoyances with this - you do a lot of travelling around, and in the early stages of the game there aren't many fast travel options to mitigate this. But now I've been without it for two weeks, I've found myself missing the big spaces and warm welcomes of that world.\nRead more",

I've become a big fan of it in that time - it's spacious, easy to build in, cool and clean - and the only real downside is the price.\nThe case debuted late last year for a princely £240, expensive even for a large form factor case, but now it's down to £175 - a more reasonable ask given its full tower size and laundry list of features, which I'll tell you about presently. \n\nGet the Corsair 7000D Airflow PC case for £175 (was £240)\n\nRead more",

          "description": "Some of Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake processors are among the best gaming CPUs you can buy, but certain owners have noticed a seemingly worrisome trend: their LGA 1700 motherboard socket puts so much pressure on the chip that its IHS (integrated heat spreader, the big grey bit on top) starts to bend. This isn’t so much a concern for the CPU’s structural integrity as it is a cooling issue, as a non-flat IHS will struggle to transfer heat to the CPU cooler plate as effectivity.\r\n\n\r\nIn a statement to Tom’s Hardware, however, an Intel spokesperson has essentially said it’s not as bad as it sounds. The statement does acknowledge the warping (or “deflection”, to use Intel’s more engineer-y term), but says there’s no evidence thus far to suggest it drives load temperatures up to unsafe levels.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Its very minimalistic roguelike style captured players looking for something casual, but still engrossing. You pick one of several characters and move them around the screen as they auto-attack. As enemies are disposed of the player levels up, along with changing weapons and gaining power-ups, with the ultimate goal being to keep the ever growing mob of enemies under control. On death you unlock new weapons and characters by spending coins gained in battle.\r\n\n\r\nWhile the game currently sits on Steam with an “overwhelmingly popular” based on almost 70k reviews, success is definitely not what solo developer Luca Galante was expecting when he first started working on it.\nRead more",

          "description": "When we were putting together our most anticipated games of 2022 list back in January, there was one game I knew had to be on it: Mojiken Studio’s A Space For The Unbound. It’s a slice of life adventure about two Indonesian high school students set in the late 90s, and the demo (which has recently been expanded to include the first chapter in addition to its short prologue) instantly captivated me when I first played it a couple of years ago. There are some light supernatural elements that will be instantly familiar to anyone who’s watched the films of Japanese anime directors Makoto Shinkai and Mamoru Hosoda (including a giant, ominous Your Name-style comet, no less), but for the most part this is a much more grounded game than Mojiken have made in the past, such as the fantastical point and click puzzlers She And The Light Bearer and When The Past Was Around. \nIndeed, the only game in their back catalogue that has a recognisable, real-life setting is their short, free browser game Banyu Lintar Angin. Born out of an internal game jam project in 2017, Banyu Lintar Angin once again draws inspiration from the studio’s home country of Indonesia. It only takes a couple of minutes to play, but speaking with its creator Dimas Novan, it was vital in sowing the seeds for what A Space For The Unbound would eventually become.\nRead more",

In the midst of a years-long components shortage, exacerbated by all manner of price-gouging bollocks, it’d be entirely understandable if upgrade-starved PC owners went for this like my cat goes for unattended crisp packets. Especially if they’re happy to stick to playing at 1080p.\r\n\n\r\nAlas, the RX 6500 XT isn’t just an inferior low-end option to the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 (one of the best graphics cards, and perhaps the outright best for budget builds right now). It’s an offputtingly slow, sometimes bizarrely-designed GPU in general; instead of providing long-overdue relief to a truly fudged hardware market, it ends up feeling like more an attempt to just sell any old second-rate kit to an audience that’s been left desperate for something, anything that’s new and somewhat affordable.\nRead more",

Sandrock may look more traditionally post-apocalyptic, being as it is a sandy outback populated by cowboys, but it's still got a helping-hands community feel at its core, plus an interesting eco-friendly angle and an all-new multiplayer mode. But its origins were much more modest. As Pathea Games' executive producer Zifei Wu tells me, Sandrock originally began life as a My Time At Portia DLC pack. \nRead more",

          "description": "Sony has delayed Spider-Man: Across The Universe, the highly anticipated sequel to 2018’s Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse, from Oct. 7 to June 2, 2023. \nThis marks a nearly eight-month delay for the animated sequel that is set to star Shameik Moore and Hailey Steinfeld as Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy, respectively, as reported by Deadline. When Across The Spider-Verse was previously revealed, it was shown to be a Part I, with Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse Part II slated to release after it. More specifically, it’s dated for March 29, 2024. \nAs for why this delay has happened, that remains unclear. Sony hasn’t stated why Across The Spider-Verse Part I has been delayed. However, considering we’re in a pandemic, it’s possible the delay is related to COVID-19, which has caused delays across the movie industry, games industry, and more. Or perhaps, more simply, the filmmaking team needs more time. \nInto The Spider-Verse made roughly $375 million worldwide at the box office and considering the franchise is even more popular now than it was upon release, there’s a good chance Across The Spider-Verse easily eclipses that. Only time will tell, though. \nDeadline’s report also states that Sony’s other animated movie, Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile has moved up from its Nov. 18 date to Oct. 7, taking Across The Spider-Verse’s original release date. Elsewhere in Sony’s somewhat disjointed Spider-Man-related universe, Madame Web, which will star Euphoria’s Sydney Sweeney and Fifty Shades Of Grey’s Dakota Johnson, has received a July 7, 2023 release date. \nWhile waiting for Across The Spider-Verse, read Game Informer’s Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales review to find out why it’s a great Spider-Man game, and then check out the reveal of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 after that. If you need even more comic book games in your life, watch this reveal of Insomniac’s Wolverine game. \n[Source: Deadline]\nAre you excited for Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse?

Marvel's Avengers launched with six playable characters, but that's far from all the heroes we'll be able to take control of when it's all said and done.

This new Ghostbusting experience will let you team up with up to three friends in VR to track down the paranormal and blast them with your Proton Packs to trap them and take them back to your HQ. Players will run that headquarters in San Francisco, a city never explored in the Ghostbusters franchise. nDreams is promising an \"expansive and engrossing\" campaign that can be played alone or in co-op.\n\n\nThe trailer released today, while an in-engine cinematic, is not actual gameplay, but there are some hints as to what the game may look like when it's released, including fun character customizations like the cute animal hat worn by one of the 'Busters. \nThere's no date on when the now-called Ghostbusters VR will hit Meta Quest 2, but a press release claims more information will become available in the coming months. But GBVR isn't the only Ghostbusters game in the works, as Illfonic's Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed, an asymmetrical multiplayer title is coming later this year.",

Developer Polyarc announced during the Meta Quest Showcase today that Moss II would arrive on the platform this summer.\nMoss II on Meta Quest 2 will have more freedom in the way it's played, according to Polyarc. The move to a newer headset like the Quest allows players to utilize both Quest controllers as opposed to a single DualShock controller like in the PS5/PS4 edition. Polyarc says it lets players perform actions such as engaging with the weapon inventory system during combat.\n“One of the first things we heard when we launched Moss: Book II on PlayStation VR a few weeks ago was that the Quest 2 community wanted to play it, and we’re going to deliver on that in the very near future,” said Polyarc CEO Tam Armstrong, in a press release shared with Game Informer. “Our goal from day one has been getting the Moss franchise onto as many headsets as possible. We want all VR players to have the opportunity to experience the joy of physical interaction and power of the emotional resonance we’ve been building into the worlds we create. We’re excited to share our game with millions of Quest 2 players around the world this summer.”\nAn exact release date was not shared for Moss: Book II, but we can't wait to try it out on a Quest 2 sometime this summer. If you want to dig into Moss: Book II and have a PlayStation VR, the game is ready to download and play there.",

If you’re having trouble making sense of it, we don't blame you. It's confusing at first glance, so here’s a plain breakdown of what it entails. \nThe Standard Edition, which is just the game, costs $39.99. The Digital Deluxe version runs for $44.99 and includes the game plus the following items: \nHard Missions\nLetterbox background\nCharacter animation in main menu\nCamera controls over main menu islands\nCharacter animations during music islands\nExclusive tracks from Genesis/Mega Drive titles\nWith us so far? Good. Now, there are three content packs, two of which are unavailable for purchase at the moment. They are: \nStart Dash Pack (included with digital pre-orders of Standard or Digital Deluxe Editions)\n100 Medallion bonus\nMirror Mode unlocked\nLetterbox background (Genesis/Mega Drive Pattern)\nPremium & Classic Sound Packs (Coming soon)\nExclusive tracks from Genesis/Mega Drive titles\nPremium Fun Pack (Coming soon)\nHard missions\nLetterbox background\nCharacter animation in main menu\nCamera controls over main menu islands\nCharacter animations during music islands\nBasically, the Classic Sound and Fun Packs are just the bonuses included in the Digital Deluxe edition but slightly divided.

That’s about all there is in terms of details, as the project appears very early in development. \n“I’ve often described how seeing Star Wars in 1977 essentially rewired my 12-year-old brain, shaping my creative life and future indelibly,” said Hennig in the press release. “I’m elated to be working with Lucasfilm Games again to tell interactive stories in this galaxy that I love.”\nHennig, best known as the chief creative mind behind the Uncharted series, is no stranger to working on the Star Wars license. Her last foray into the universe was EA’s ill-fated Project Ragtag, the canceled Star Wars title by the now-defunct Visceral Games.  \nThis marks the second major project for Skydance New Media, which was formed in 2019. Last October, Hennig announced her team was developing an original story-focused action-adventure Marvel game as its first title. We still don’t know anything about that game either, but having now two major Disney properties under its belt are big gets for the young studio. \nNow that the Star Wars license is no longer exclusive to EA, this new project joins the pile of several upcoming games from a variety of studios. Quantic Dreams’ Star Wars Eclipse was announced last December, and Ubisoft’s mysterious open-world game hasn't made a peep since its announcement last year.",

Earlier this year, a scoreboard detailing ribbon progression, match stats, and more was finally implemented. And while there’s a list of features the community would like to see added to Dice’s frenetic shooter, VOIP (voice over internet protocol) has remained somewhere near the top. In today’s Battlefield 2042’s update, 4.0, limited voice chat options have been introduced.\nBut what does ”limited” mean? According to the official EA/Battlefield website, there are now “two voice chat channels to choose between: Party and Squad. Settings for VoIP can be adjusted via Options > Sound/Voice > Chat while in-game.” Sadly, you won’t be able to communicate with your whole team just yet, but this is definitely a solid start. Moreover, a Scoreboard UI refresh hit 2042 servers. Finally, a ton of weapon attachements, matchmaking/social, progression//unlocks, maps, and player character changes have been made for a more streamlined action experience. You can read through the extensive amount of fixes here.\nAre you still playing Battlefield 2042? What’s your experience been like over the past few months?",

          "description": "A new report from Bloomberg states that Sega is developing big-budget reboots of two of its most popular Dreamcast games: Crazy Taxi and Jet Set Radio. \nAccording to the Bloomberg report, which cites “people familiar with its [Sega’s] plans,” Sega is developing these reboots looking to tap into its back catalog in search of a hit like Fortnite. These two reboots could be the first of Sega’s Super Game initiatives that it announced last November. \nThis begs the question: why is Sega looking to Crazy Taxi and Jet Set Radio to be a Fortnite? Fortnite is a battle royale with plenty of crossover opportunities thanks to its live events and multitudes of outfits, and it’s free, which certainly lends to its popularity. Crazy Taxi and Jet Set Radio are decidedly not like Fortnite, but perhaps Sega has more drastic plans for these reboots. Bloomberg also reports that Sega’s European studio is working on a first-person Super Game, so maybe that is the title Sega hopes to become its own Fortnite-like hit. \nThe Crazy Taxi reboot has been in development for more than a year, and Sega plans to release it in the next two to three years. Jet Set Radio is also early in development, and the publication’s sources say both games could still be canceled. \nFor the uninitiated, Crazy Taxis is a zany quasi-racing title where players are tasked with transporting passengers across town in a high-speed taxi, all while tracks from The Offspring (and others) play. On the other hand, Jet Set Radio is a game about rollerblading and graffiti, with flashy visuals in an area not unlike the shopping districts of Tokyo and a soundtrack that rips.\nBoth Crazy Taxi and Jet Set Radio are beloved by their fans, so here’s hoping these reboots come to fruition as games we can all play one day. \n[Source: Bloomberg]\nWould you be excited about a Crazy Taxi or Jet Set Radio reboot?

Despite the nebulous classification, games in this genre are unambiguously incredible experiences, often exploring refreshing and fascinating concepts. Shooting for games that are rolling around in the zeitgeist right now, some of the genres’ towering giants are not listed here. However, for anyone looking to check out today’s great experiences, feel free to peruse our list of the best adventure games …",

          "description": "Atlus has announced a landmark sales figure for its latest Shin Megami Tensei game on Switch, boasting a new seven-figure total for copies sold. Shin Megami Tensei V has officially sold over one million units worldwide. \nThe news came from a tweet on the Altus_West Twitter account, dropping the monumental amount of sales for the exclusive Switch JRPG. The tweet only says the one million figure represents total worldwide sales but doesn't break down the number into units sold for each region. \nShin Megami Tensei V has sold 1 million units worldwide! ✨\n#SMT5 pic.twitter.com/ZDKePUroZS\nApril 18, 2022\nAlso embedded within the tweet, which you can see above, is a piece of art depicting the main character from SMTV drawn by character designer Masayuki Doi as a thank you to fans who purchased the game.\nThe turn of the year brought news of SMTV climbing to the top of the series' sales charts when Atlus claimed it had sold 800,000 copies, and it has only been steadily selling since. The previous entry, 2014's Shin Megami Tensei IV on 3DS, sold upwards of 600,000 copies, an impressive number for a franchise that hasn't quite hit the mainstream yet. On the other hand, SMTV still has a little way to go to catch up with the latest Shin Megami Tensei spinoff, Persona 5 Royal, which has sold more than 1.8 million copies worldwide, according to a story from Gematsu from last June.\nShin Megami Tensei V tells the tale of a modern-day student in Tokyo that's transported to an apocalyptic alternate reality and finds themselves wrapped up in a war between angels and demons. Read our review if you'd like to learn more about SMT V and see if it'll be your cup of tea.",

For others, it’s a virtual workspace or a digital version of the world we already live in. The most commonly accepted version of the metaverse, though, is something that resembles Ready Player One where all of your favorite characters, friends, and family members interact with each other in a 3D virtual world. Or at least, that’s the most idealized vision of what the metaverse could be.\nOf course, that’s not a reality at the moment and the closest something’s come might be Epic’s juggernaut free-to-play battle royale game, Fortnite.

          "description": "Marvel Studios has released an official teaser trailer for Thor: Love and Thunder. \nThis trailer comes just months before this sequel, which is directed by Thor: Ragnarok director Taika Waititi, hits theaters. With the release of this trailer, Thor: Love and Thunder now holds the record for the shortest amount of time between a Marvel Cinematic Universe movie's first trailer and its release in theaters. It's hard to complain, though, because while we did have to wait a while for this trailer, now, seeing how great it looks, it's nice knowing we only have to wait a few months to actually see the movie. \nYou can watch the official teaser trailer for Thor: Love and Thunder below:\n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, there's not much going on story-wise, especially when you consider we already know a lot about what the movie's going to cover i.e. Gorr the God Butcher as the villain, Jane Foster as The Mighty Thor, and more. In fact, Gorr isn't mentioned once in the trailer and we only get a few quick seconds of Jane as Thor right at the end of the teaser. \nHowever, despite that, we do get plenty on the whereabouts of Thor and where he's at mentally following the events of Avengers: Endgame, which is where we last saw him. As expected, he's put in some work to get back to his more cut physique (here's hoping we get an amazing workout montage set to some '80s music) and he's rolling with the Guardians of the Galaxy (this is also our first look at this team since Endgame). \nAs for where Thor's at mentally, he seems less inclined on partying and fighting, and more about taking in the life around him and ultimately, living a peaceful and tranquil existence. \nTo accompany today's teaser trailer, Marvel Studios has also released a new Thor: Love and Thunder poster, which you can view below: \nThor: Love and Thunder hits theaters July 8.\nAre you excited about Thor: Love and Thunder?

But were our heroes victorious in their respective paths? Join us on The Game Informer Show as we review \"Homecoming,\" the fourth episode in the Paramount Plus show, and let you know if it continues to build on the success of the previous episode.\n\n\nYour regular hosts are back for another round of hilarity and analysis that you've come to expect from GI's review of the Halo series. Alex Stadnik, Andrew Reiner, and Brian Shea are breaking down this week's episode and have a lot to say about another step back for a series that includes some of the most iconic characters in video games.\nWe start the episode with the promise of answers to what's going on with John's memories and the artifact that somehow connects to what we can presume is one of the Halo rings. Those answers come at the end of the episode, but \"Homecoming\" spends far too much time drawing out those scenes, continuing the series' trend of poor pacing. On top of that, we finally find ourselves on Madrigal with Soren and Kwan, which continues to feel like a distraction from the main story we care about.\nThere are some positive aspects of episode four, though. Kai has followed John's lead and gone rogue by removing her emotions-blocking pellet and starts to see the world a bit differently. Her interactions with Miranda Keyes and the rest of the Spartans provide some levity and clarity and prove there is hope for the series yet.\nWhat do you think about Halo thus far? Be sure to let us know in the comments below. We'd also love your feedback on the extra GI Show episodes. Do you like them? Do you want to see us focus on games or the Marvel shows in the future?

          "description": "Halo Infinite’s second season, Lone Wolves, is slated to begin on May 3 and brings a host of new content to the game. 343 Industries released a blog post detailing one of its most exciting additions in the form of two new maps: Catalyst and Breaker.\nCatalyst is a sleek, though abandoned, Forerunner base that’s been reclaimed by nature. Expect plenty of foliage to cover its monolithic surfaces, and 343 describes Catalyst as a vertical symmetrical arena featuring suspended catwalks and a light bridge connecting the map’s two halves. \nBreaker is a Banished shipyard laden with debris situated on a dusty desert planet. Its centerpiece element is a giant plasma cutting beam moving across the map that players can battle around at their own peril or benefit. 343 describes Breaker as a “pseudo symmetric BTB” map. Catalyst and Breaker will support all of the existing multiplayer modes as well as the new ones coming next season. You can watch a video fly-by of both arenas in the video below.\n\n\nBe sure to read 343's blog post for the developer's complete breakdown of these maps' inspirations and design elements. Lone Wolves will also introduce new story elements, modes, and cosmetics – 343 plans to spill the beans on those additions in the coming weeks. \nFor more on Halo Infinite, read about how longtime support studio Certain Affinity is deepening its relationship with 343.

          "description": "CD Projekt Red has released its 2021 Fiscal Year earnings, revealing new sales numbers for both its Witcher franchise and its latest game, Cyberpunk 2077. \nTo probably nobody’s surprise, both The Witcher series and Cyberpunk 2077 have sold really well for CDPR. In fact, as of today, The Witcher series has sold more than 65 million copies, with more than 40 million of them being The Witcher III: Wild Hunt alone. Cyberpunk 2077, on the other hand, has sold more than 18 million copies. \n\n\nThe last time CDPR publicly released sales numbers for its latest RPG, the studio revealed in April of last year that Cyberpunk 2077 sold more than 13.7 million copies in 2020. That means that between the end of 2020 and now – so roughly 16 months – Cyberpunk 2077 has sold about 5 million copies. That’s still an impressive number, to be sure, but it speaks to a larger drop off for the title’s sales in 2021.\nOf course, many studios would be happy with selling 5 million in any amount of time but for CDPR, a studio with the Witcher series in its portfolio crossing the 65 million units sold mark, 5 million might not be as impressive. The perceived drop off is likely due to word-of-mouth about its post-launch state, its removal from PlayStation stores for six months, and more. \nCDPR has been working hard to shift the perspective on Cyberpunk 2077, though, having just released Update 1.5, which fixes many of the RPG’s problems and makes now the perfect time to play the game. Still, it seems Cyberpunk 2077 will remain in the shadow of CDPR’s Witcher series, especially now that we know the studio is working on a new Witcher game that will be made in Unreal Engine 5. \nBut, as CDPR’s 2021 FY earnings show, Cyberpunk 2077 might get a boost when its Netflix anime, Cyberpunk Edgerunners, is released this year. \nFor more, read Game Informer’s Cyberpunk 2077 PC review and then read Game Informer’s The Witcher 3 review. \nAre you excited for CDPR’s new Witcher game?

Thanks to a tweet from the Lost Ark team, we may be able to play one of those subclasses in the game very soon.\npic.twitter.com/revMkHg6K4\nApril 14, 2022\nThe tweet, which you can see above, only contains a GIF of a rotating bladed polearm that indicates and a date emblazoned below it of April 21 indicates the Gaivalier is set to arrive in an update next week. Also known as the Lance Master in the Korean Lost Ark, the Glaivier is a Martial Artist subclass that specializes in using spears and glaives, poking enemies with dangerous sharp objects from a safe distance. She can use her special class ability to switch between stances while fighting.\nThe Glaivier already has a page on the official Lost Ark site that gives a brief description of its playstyle and shows shows off some of the skills you'll be utilizing on the battlefield. Here's Lost Ark's description of the new subclass:\n\"The Glaivier has two distinct skill sets, each one is represented by one of her weapons, the spear and the glaive. The best way to leverage her eloquent, yet deadly form of martial arts is to find balance between her two stances.\"\nIf the April 21 date is truly the release of the Glaivier, we'll be swinging big deadly polearms in all kinds of badass ways in a week's time. If you're new to Lost Ark, its an isometric online action/RPG that you can download and play for free on Steam. I gave the game an 8.25 out of 10 in my review which you can read here. If you're a fan of games like Diablo, or want to try an MMO that's easy to get into, Lost Ark is a great game to check out.",

          "description": "South of the Circle is a narrative adventure centered on survival and romance in the midst of the Cold War that first launched in Apple Arcade in 2020. The game comes from Lumino City developer State of Play and is now being published by 11 Bit Studios, the team behind Frostpunk and This War of Mine. \nUnfolding during the politically charged 1960s, players control a climate scientist named Peter. As a Cambridge academic, he finds himself conflicted with the brewing global conflict, which drives a wedge between himself and his love, Clara. Peter’s troubles escalate during a trip when he crash-lands in Antarctica. Stranded, he must now survive the frigid landscape while reflecting on the personal and professional choices that took him to this point. \n\n\nState of Play says South of the Circle is inspired by narrative adventure games such as Firewatch and What Remains of Edith Finch and boasts a striking cinematic, minimalist art direction. It's unclear how gameplay unfolds, but the implication is that interactions will be on the minimal side of things. The game is brought to life by an ensemble cast including Gwilym Lee (Bohemian Rhapsody), Olivia Vinall (The Woman in White), Richard Goulding (The Crown), Anton Lesser (Game of Thrones), Adrian Rawlins (Chernobyl), and Michael Fox (Downton Abbey).\nSouth of the Circle is planned to launch later this year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",

Since then, Motive Studios has shared new information through special behind-the-scenes live streams, and one happened last month that was all about the audio of the remake. \nMotive showcased new gameplay to highlight some of the audio changes it’s made in the remake so far, specifically regarding the famed Plasma Cutter and Pulse Rifle weapons. During the stream, fans were already discussing their thoughts on the weapon sounds in the live chat, and it seems Motive used those suggestions and feedback from elsewhere to modify the sounds even more. \nThings you did:\npic.twitter.com/HIMJ9kHRE4\nApril 13, 2022\nAs you can see in the Tweet above, Motive has changed how the Plasma Cutter and Pulse Rifle sound. Both sound a touch deeper and more focused than during the March Livestream. You can listen to the sounds of these weapons in the original Dead Space, how they sounded during the March stream, and how they sound now in that video, and the changes are quite stark for those tuned into the remake’s audio. \nOf course, these changes aren’t final, and it wouldn’t be surprising if Motive listens to feedback on the new audio to modify the weapon sounds further. The next time we’ll see more of this Dead Space remake will be during a special stream next month, focused on its visuals. \nUntil then, check out the latest Dead Space remake gameplay and then read about how the team plans to learn from mistakes in the past. \nAre you excited for the Dead Space remake?
