However, developer Natsume Atari has dared to attempt recapturing the lightning-in-a-bottle success of the iconic crossover series by combining those same ingredients into an all-new package: Reynatis. This fresh action RPG first hit the Switch in Japan in June 2024, and is now arriving overseas. We’d like to say that’s cause for celebration, but as enticing as a game that boasts some of the same key talent and gameplay underpinnings from Square Enix’s beloved action franchise may sound, we reckon this second go-around needed more time in the oven.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Fragrant Story and Papaya's Path is now available on the Switch eShop and (as you might expect from that name) it packs in the base game and its 2023 DLC expansion too.\nFor those who missed this one when it launched on the 3DS in *checks notes* 2022, Fragrant Story is a tactical RPG inspired by the classics. Created by indie developer William Kage, this short-but-sweet Final Fantasy Tactics-style experience was a little too slight for our tastes at launch, but this Switch release extends the campaigns of both the base game and the DLC, beefing things up to a 10-hour story and a 30-hour 100% completion — not bad when you consider the original lasted us maybe five hours.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "\"Nintendo took its time to really build the case\".\nWhile everyone is patiently awaiting news from Nintendo regarding its upcoming Switch successor, the company made another, undoubtedly more surprising, announcement.\nMonths after Palworld's release, Nintendo has now filed a patent lawsuit against developer Pocketpair, claiming that Palworld \"infringes multiple patent rights\". Now, we all know that Nintendo can be utterly ruthless when it comes to protecting its intellectual property and, according to a new interview with games analyst Serkan Toto via 404 Media, the company is almost certainly going to win.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The forthcoming Toxic Crusaders is going for a similar look, Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons was uncharacteristically cutesy, and now The Karate Kid: Street Rumble features a cast that look like they rolled out of a Gashapon vending machine.\nThat said, the aesthetic effort here is quite accomplished. Set in a pastel-hued mid-'80s Reseda, California, while locations are rather plain initially, they quickly improve as things progress, with one of the best-looking arcade centre stages we’ve seen in a while. The spritework is excellent, too, with cool characters who are both well-formed and animated, and have a nice finish in terms of colour casting. The pixel art is a far cry from the cutscene art, anyway, which kind of sucks.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Sadly, it’s still no first-rate adaptation, neglecting numerous PC features and giving low-end systems an even deeper kick in the plums.

But that's the problem: who is everyone? At first I thought, \"This game is for young kids and that's fine!\", given its relative simplicity. Then I hit some puzzles and thought, \"Ain't no kid figuring this out\".\nThen it hit me. It struggles to balance the fine line between being approachable for tiny tots and layered enough for people who've graduated from \"goo goo ga ga\" to \"oo oo aa aa my back hurts\".

UFO 50 is a kart of 50 games that once existed for an old computer system, all lovingly restored by a gang of coders. The old console, of course, is a fiction. The LX-I never existed. But it's a fun pseudo-history against which to create a grab bag of small games (some throwaway, others mighty) all designed with a distinct 80s look. It's an exercise in adhering to an aesthetic. Like an oil painter working with a limited range of colours, the developers of this bundle have stuck to a 32-colour equivalent of the Zorn palette. Yet play a little of each game, and you start to sense the smirk of chronos. These games aren't stuck in the past, but they are enjoying a holiday there. \nRead more",

          "description": "Why is every blockbuster video game now some kind of live service game? Speaking as a clueless idiot, the explanation I find most convincing is that it's an attempt to bridge the gap between the returns publishers want from video games, versus how much we're able or willing to pay upfront. \"Triple-A\" projects now cost exorbitant sums to develop, partly thanks to wider economic inflation, but also because publishers have spent decades teaching players that every sequel has to be More and Shinier. Premium game prices have not risen in proportion, and investors want growth, as they do.\nLive service games sneak around this difficulty by dragging out the time we spend playing them. Whether premium or free-to-play, they seek to install themselves as habits by means of regular, planned updates and additions. This is time that can be monetised by way of a subscription model, time in which other products may be sold to you, like skins and paintjobs, and time that becomes a commodity in itself, \"engagement\", which can be transmuted and exploited to various end. I'm not sure it's ever been expressed this way in any press release boast about longevity, but the unspoken principle/logical extrapolation seems to be that ideally, a live service game should keep us plugged in and plugging away till we die.\n Read more",

          "description": "Strange Scaffold’s newly released FPS I Am Your Beast is very fun for quite a few reasons, but chief among them is a deep appreciation for the poetry of good videogame violence. I’m not using the big P word just to throw out an overly worthy comparison to something we might associate with craft or beauty, but as a nod toward the game’s playful application of what I previously called ‘a euphoric splurge of murderous game verbiage’ one morning where I had clearly eaten my wordy Weetabix. The way its hurled knives and curb stomps and inexplicable decapitations flow together have an assonant, almost Suessian quality to them.\nBut it’s also, well, just a bit like Mad Libs. You play as Harding, a man who’s mythical lethality is established very early on. The showing is there in the moment to moment, but the telling is conveyed through cute tricks like how everyone you meet is so deeply afraid of Harding that they loudly keep track of exactly what weapon he’s holding at all times. The Mad Libs comes in through the fact that you can draw Harding a route between A and B, and it’s a given that multiple heads are going to come unstuck from necks along the way. You’re sort of just casually filling in the verbs that seem the most fun to you in the moment. One of the verbs is ‘hornet’. Hornet is a verb now.\nRead more",

          "description": "In theory, vampires and immersive sims go together as naturally as bats and caves. Immersive sims tend to involve a balance of stealth, acrobatics, raw strength and crafty manipulation, and vampires are celebrated for all of these things. Despite this, actual vampire-themed immersive sims are rare. My list starts with Vampire: the Masquerade: Bloodlines... and sort of ends there. In a devastating betrayal, Arkane Austin's Redfall wasn't an immersive sim but an open world co-op shooter (a not very good one). The much-delayed Bloodlines 2 was recently downgraded from immersive sim to RPG by new developers The Chinese Room. Arkane Lyon's Blade adaptation seems promising, but it's a ways off. \r\n\n\r\nHere to paper over the immersive vamping gap in the market is Byte Barrel's Trust, \"a new first-person shooter with immersive sim elements\". It takes place in a world where the vampires are hunted for their blood, which has become an everyday human energy source, used for everything from car batteries to streetlights. The irony! I feel like, in the circumstances, the ideal solution would be for humans to let vampires suck their blood in return for vampires letting humans use their blood for electricity, but that wouldn't make for a very thrilling shooter. Anyway, here's the trailer.\r\n \nRead more",

It uses a square aspect display ratio calibrated to give wizened Game Boy enthusiasts the shakes, and is made up of 200 single-screen rooms that \"slot into the larger puzzle-box of the world\".

          "description": "In V Rising, you're a fledgling vampire on a mission to become absolute bossferatu of a Gothic open world. You get a Diablo-ish combat system, the ability to shapeshift into a spider, and a whole castle to prance around in, crooning at the moon. I like this premise almost as much as I dislike the fact that V Rising is also a survival game, in which you must fell trees and master a crafting system like a common turnip farmer.\r\n\n\r\nWhat do we hope for when our interest in a game is almost perfectly balanced by our disinterest? We hope that the developers will treat us to a free-to-play weekend, in which our perhaps-unfounded reservations might be strategically offset by the endorphin rush of not having paid any goddamn money. This, V Rising creators Stunlock have now done. The game is free to download and play on Steam from right now until Monday, 16th September at 5pm UK or 10am PST.\r\n\n \nRead more",

You draw a line down each object with your mouse, then click or hit space bar to perform a slice. Then, the game calculates a percentage.  If it's bang-on or very close to 50/50, you'll pass.

The Mesoamerican pixelart landscapes, for example - radiant, cloud-hung platters of land with people and buildings reduced to daubs of paint in the foreground. The fact that it's about witnessing and surviving colonial invasion, rather than the more familiar European or North American video game fantasy of searching a New World for plunder.\nThe ensemble storytelling, with four, successively playable characters setting their own lenses to thickly entangled themes of sorrow, vengeance and growing understanding. The sparse, expressive dialogue, each phrase carefully tucked inside its speech bubble. The music. And the little things at the level of how you move, what you do. When you pick a faraway destination on your map, your character makes the journey screen by screen, which gives you a second to lean back and be a passenger, watching the horizon, at least until you're ambushed by a giant beetle. \r\n \nRead more",

According to a leaked memo, Microsoft are laying off around 650 people \"to organize our business for long term success\". This is the same Microsoft that parted with around 1900 employees in January, and the same Microsoft that washed their hands of around 10,000 staff in January 2023, all in the name of shoring up the business for future prosperity. That \"long term success\" is certainly taking its sweet time.

One that favours the joyous freeform sightseeing of an Elden Ring or Breath Of The Wild; where you’ll scramble up vast industrial concrete ruins on scavenging missions for inquisitive frogs, instead of being nagged by bothersome checklists?\nOk, rain check on that last point. SandWitch can’t help but eventually funnel the freedom of ambling around in your chuffy yellow van into restrictive collect-a-thons. Still, for much of its breezy runtime, this one’s a real panacea for gaming’s more bloated map-scourers. Plus, even when you are sent off to hamster-cheek scavenged components before making progress, there’s very little in this world that doesn’t feel intentional. Sidequests and storytelling crumbs are deliberately scattered throughout, and each building is a thoughtful concrete puzzle box. It is, in brief, a nice time.\nYou play as Sauge, a spacefarer returned to her planet of Cigalo after receiving a distress signal from her missing sister. Cigalo’s a cheery place, though economically and environmentally devastated after being exploited by an evil spacecorp named The Consortium. It’s populated by small settlements of people, some large talking frogs named the Reinetos, and the occasional friendly robot. Everything’s friendly, as it goes - even gravity itself. There’s no danger, no death, no damage from flinging yourself off the tallest building you can find. Just helping out your desert buds, upgrading your van with more gadgets to solve puzzles, or working on finding exactly where Sauge’s sister has go to.\n Read more",

But then you find an outlaw buddy who offers a new way to shoot human dirtbags. Then another fellow bandit. And another. By the time your spaceship is half-filled with scoundrels and weirdoes shouting at each other, the game has warmed up enough to reveal its central idea. This ain't no grand FPS campaign, nor is it quick as roguelikes go. It's a snacky shootout sim with tumbleweed towns that feels best when you savour the pre-fight suspense.\nRead more",

          "description": "If you partake of some virtual rubber-burning, you might remember Ubisoft shuttered its open world racing game The Crew in March by turning off its servers. Given that The Crew is an online-only game, that signalled its death knell… or death horn, more accurately. Then in April, they tow-trucked the game out of people's libraries and revoked their purchases. This led to a backlash, as you'd expect, and Ubisoft are accordingly taking a different approach with The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest.

Pretty good, actually – perhaps not to the extent that you should tackle Space Marine 2 on a crusty notebook (or, for the record, a Steam Deck), but it runs decently on minimum specs and is noticeably more stable than in that preview.

You'll have the chance to harness this ability in Jujutsu Piece, a game that blends the worlds of JJK and One Piece. \n\n\nSo, if you want a taste of Gojo's unique skill, here's how to get Limitless in Roblox's Jujutsu Piece.\n\n\nHow to unlock Limitless in Jujutsu Piece Roblox\n\n\nTo unlock Limitless in Jujutsu Piece, speak to The Dealer or The Lucky Sorceror. You'll encounter these characters in the main hub, near the Race and Clan area. Interact with The Dealer to unlock Limitless immediately, using 2,750,000 cash or 1,749 R (Robux). However, you may need to wait for it to come back in stock once the store refreshes.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nGiven the hefty price tag set by The Dealer, you might want to consider The Lucky Sorceror as a more cost-effective option. Engage in a conversation with him and roll for the elusive Limitless technique, which has a mere four percent chance of dropping. While the odds may not be in your favor, this route could save you some cash and reward your patience.\n\n\nYou'll earn cash with higher levels and after defeating the game's many bosses. Using Jujutsu Piece codes is also helpful, as they provide EXP boosts and Clan/Race Spins.\n\n\nWith enough money, you can place the Limitless Mastery in your Roblox Jujutsu Piece arsenal. Uncover robust attacks like Reversal Red, Lapse: Blue, Maximum Output Red, Maximum Output Blue, and Hollow Purple. You can end it all off with the formidable Unlimited Void, transporting everyone around you to a new area.

          "description": "The big buff patch that arrived this week for Helldivers 2 apparently introduced a new bug that allows players to fly across the map. Man, what is it with emotes in Helldivers 2 and their ability to let players defy gravity with such confidence? \n\n\nPlayers on the official Helldivers subreddit recently revealed the exploit. In a short video clip, a player rhythmically taps the Emote button to, well, teabag through the air with the greatest of ease. \n\n\n\n\nAccording to the poster, the exploit was unintentionally discovered when they were trying to make use of a different exploit tied to emotes. In July, players learned that emoting while hurtling through the air may prevent lethal fall damage. It looks like it's not just the weapons that got buffed by the patch. \n\n\nArrowhead can work on the Jump Pack later\n\n\nAnyone who has played games long enough will understand that updates and patches can lead to bugs. Helldivers 2 is certainly no stranger to the idea. The game typically experiences issues brought by patches, ranging from new bugs to crashes. In this case, the bug was likely introduced by the new emote wheel function that was added by the update. I'd take surprise flying powers over a new way for the game to crash any day, thanks.\n\n\nThe bug will likely get fixed eventually. Emoting to prevent fall damage is a glitch that has remained, likely due to the Arrowhead CEO enthusiastically endorsing it. But flying for free isn't something I can see remaining in the game. If anything, those averse to gravity will have to wait for a Jump Pack buff, which is in the plans according to creative director Johan Pilestedt. \n\n\n\n\nUntil then, I expect to see my fellow divers tea-bagging their way across the land to power-squat on Shrieker Nests with authority. If we can't win this war with weapons, we'll do so with Slavic intimidation.\n\nThe post Forget the Jump Pack, the Helldivers 2 buff patch is letting players fly appeared first on Destructoid.",

Though you don't get many, you can still target farm Shadow Traces so you can evolve units as needed.  Here is how to get and use the Shadow Traces you need in Anime Vanguards.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHow to get Shadow Traces\n\n\nThe best way to get Shadow Traces in Anime Vanguards is to complete and farm the Double Dungeon Legend Stage Act 2 which is titled The Tossing Titan. This dungeon recommends Level 21+, and after 15 waves you will have to defeat the Spear Statue boss. Completing this Legend Stage has a 100% chance of rewarding between 1-3 Shadow Traces.\n\n\nThis means you can continually farm The Tossing Titan stage over and over to farm as many Shadow Traces as you need. With an optimized build, you can typically clear the stage in about 6-8 minutes, so depending on your luck you can often farm as much Shadow Traces as you need to evolve a unit in about an hour or less.\n\n\nHow to use Shadow Traces\n\n\nOnce you have enough Shadow Traces, and more than likely a required amount of Essences of various colors depending on which unit you are evolving, you can then visit the Evolve center and evolve your unit using the Shadow Traces, Essences, and Gold. More than likely, you're going to want to evolve Song Jinwu into Song Jinwu (Monarch) using your Shadow Traces. Here are the full resources required to evolve Song Jinwu:\n\n\n\n12 Shadow Traces\n\n\n1 Rainbow Essence\n\n\n30 Green Essences\n\n\n12 Pink Essences\n\n\n10 Yellow Essences\n\n\n15,000 Gold\n\n\n\nYou can also use Shadow Traces, along with multiple copies of the Song Jinwu unit to visit the Acsension vendor and ascend Song Jinwu. The amount of Shadow Traces required increases after each Ascension, but with each one, your Song Jinwu unit becomes even stronger.\n\nThe post How to get and use Shadow Traces in Anime Vanguards appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "I’ve got a real good news/bad news situation for you, but brace yourself because – if you’re most people who read this site – the bad news is going to blow away all the good. Ready? The good news is Sega has revealed it is bringing Rent-A-Hero back. The bad news is that it’s going to incorporate NFTs.\n\n\nYes, Sega is partnering with a Korean company, Line, and more specifically Line Next, “LINE’s venture dedicated to developing and expanding the NFT ecosystem.” We don’t have a lot of information about it aside from a tweet and press release from the company (spotted by Time Extension). Mostly we know that it’s going by the name of Rent A Hero Z and SEGA created a theme song for the project Master Hiro and Takenobu Mitsuyoshi.\n\n\nIf you’re not savvy, Rent A Hero is a Japan-only Mega Drive/Genesis RPG. It was later remade on Dreamcast (later ported to Xbox) as Rent A Hero No. 1, also only released in Japan. If you’ve never heard of it, that’s understandable. However, even over here in North America where we never got an official release, it’s a beloved property. \n\n\nI think this announcement is an important indication of Sega making good on its strategy of prioritizing live service and Web3 titles and leveraging its existing properties to do it. I was very skeptical when they announced the return of games like Crazy Taxi and Shinobi. While Shinobi seems like a faithful new entry, the new Crazy Taxi looks to be poising itself as a multiplayer game, and is, in all likelihood, going to be liveservice with cosmetic microtransactions. And that’s being optimistic. It could easily also have Web3 elements on top of that.\n\n\nIt’s great to see Sega return to classic licenses, but their goals eliminate all of my enthusiasm. I’ve wanted a new Crazy Taxi for a long time, but if it’s a GaaS, I’m out.\n\n\nNo release date or platforms have been announced for Rent A Hero Z. More is expected to be revealed at the Tokyo Game Show.\n\nThe post NFTs in Rent A Hero Z proves you should be careful what you wish for appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Exotics in Destiny 2 are the bread and butter of every build. While having legendary armor and weapons with the right perks equipped is important, exotics tend to be the central focus of a build and cement the direction you go.\n\n\nOne such exotic is a great way to kick off a build that's less about being your own powerhouse, and more about enabling your teammates. Here's how to get the Speaker's Sight exotic helmet in Destiny 2.\n\n\nWhere to find the Speaker's Sight helmet in Destiny 2\n\n\nThere are two ways that you can get yourself the Speaker's Sight. The first way is to complete The Final Shape campaign on Legendary difficulty for the first time (as Warlock). This will give you the choice between the Mataiodoxia chest armor and the Speaker's Sight helmet, through which you'd choose the Speaker's Sight.\n\n\nImage via Destructoid\n\n\nThe other option is through Exotic Engram Focusing. This can be done through Master Rahool at the Tower, who can be found directly to the right upon landing. If you're getting the Speaker's Sight for the first time, you'll need to get him to max rank and prestige before unlocking an additional page of Exotic Engram Focusing. Here, you can spend an Exotic Cipher and an exotic engram to get the Speaker's Sight helmet. If you've got the Speaker's Sight already and simply want a better roll, you can spend an exotic engram and a few other resources instead of a Cipher.\n\n\nIs the Speaker's Sight worth using?\n\n\nThe Speaker's Sight helmet comes with the intrinsic perk The Lost Voice, which causes Healing Grenades to spawn a turret that provides Restoration to nearby allies. Healing allies also spawns an Orb of Power. This helmet works incredibly in any support build on Warlock, centering around providing permanent restoration, cure, and healing to allies. As a personal suggestion, running this with the No Hesitation auto rifle sporting the Physic and Circle of Life as its perks is perfection.\n\nThe post How to get the Speaker’s Sight exotic helmet in Destiny 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The David Alaba Flashback objective is live in EA FC 25, and you can get a special promo item for your Ultimate Team squad.\n\n\nThe objective can be completed for free and has two tasks - an SBC and the requirement to complete a single game. Completing the SBC can be slightly tricky for many, as the requirements are pretty steep.\n\n\nHow to complete Flashback Upgrade SBC in EA FC 25\n\n\nThe Flashback Upgrade SBC requires you to submit one 86-rated and one 87-rated squad. Given that it's still the early days of Ultimate Team, completing the objective could be very difficult for most.\n\n\nTask 1 - 86-Rated Squad\n\n\n\nMin. Team Rating: 86\n\n\n\nTask 2 - 87-Rated Squad\n\n\n\nMin. Team Rating: 87\n\n\n\nHere are some template solutions you can use to complete the two tasks. Make sure to use items already available in your club. \n\n\nTask 1 - 86-Rated Squad\n\n\n\nRenard 88\n\n\nViggosdottir 84\n\n\nFoord 85\n\n\nShaw 86\n\n\nBlundell 84\n\n\nWalsh 85\n\n\nDaly 85\n\n\nBright 85\n\n\nEndler 88\n\n\nMateo 85\n\n\nMiedema 85\n\n\n\nTask 2 - 87-Rated Squad\n\n\n\nMead 88\n\n\nRenard 88\n\n\nEndler 88\n\n\nPalhinha 85\n\n\nBright 85\n\n\nMateo 85\n\n\nPopp 87\n\n\nBronze 85\n\n\nKatoto 88\n\n\nFrohms 85\n\n\nHuth 85\n\n\n\nYou'll require about 98,000 coins to get all the fodder from the market, but make sure to substitute items you have as long as their overall ratings are the same.\n\n\nThis Flashback Alaba item seems terrific to use, and he can potentially excel at both LB and CDM. He offers Falseback++, along with Anticipate, Long Ball, Jockey, and Relentless. His Pace, Passing, Dribbling, and Defending are already at excellent places, and they can be boosted further with chemistry modifiers.\n\n\n\nThe post EA FC 25: How to complete David Alaba Flashback objective appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "EA FC 25's first freebie in Ultimate Team is here, and you can reinforce your backline with the new Robert Sanchez World Tour card.\n\n\nSince it's part of an objective set, you won't need to spend any coins/fodder to get the rewards. Instead, just complete the tasks that are part of the objective, and the special card will be yours. Let's take a look at all the conditions associated with this objective set.\n\n\nEA FC 25 Robert Sanchez World Tour objective tasks\n\n\nLike many objectives of the past, the Robert Sanchez World Tour objective has four tasks. All four of them have specific conditions. You can complete them in any order you like, but some of the tasks will finish quicker than the rest.\n\n\n\nConcede no more than 1 goal per match in 5 matches\n\n\nScore 3 Finesse goals using a player from the Premier League\n\n\nScore at least 2 goals in 4 separate matches\n\n\nWin 7 matches having Min. 6 Spanish players in your starting 11\n\n\n\nOnce again, all tasks can be completed in Squad Battles and Division Rivals. Despite the changes that have been made to the game modes, Squad Battles should be your preferred choice. You can play against the AI and also control the difficulty of the contests. This will allow you to complete the goals faster and easier.\n\n\nA promo goalkeeper card might not seem attractive at first, but it's an excellent potential addition. An 83-rated shot-stopper is a good addition in the first week of the game, and your backline is secure. He's also Spanish and Premier League - great for meeting the chemistry requirements when you're just starting out.\n\n\nWith Sanchez in your squad, there won't be a need to spend big on a safe shot-stopper in the immediate future. Once you replace him later with a better card, this promo item could become useable while completing a SBC.\n\nThe post EA FC 25: How to get Robert Sanchez World Tour card for free appeared first on Destructoid.",
