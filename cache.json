          "description": "Punching up.\nNintendo’s Punch-Out!! was one of the most iconic arcade and console fixtures of the early '80s, migrating from coin-op to the NES, where it was remoulded as Mike Tyson’s Punch-Out!! and bestowed a Rocky-esque narrative around up-and-coming challenger Little Mac. Since Super Punch Out!! and the Wii’s original entry, however, it’s a series that, in stark contrast to its emphasis on fast footwork, has slouched for modern movement. And, with Nintendo reluctant to step back into the ring, Argentina’s Purple Tree Studio is now fixing to become the new victor of an undernourished franchise.\nThunder Ray’s musculature is cut and framed entirely around the Punch-Out!! formula, to the point that anyone claiming Nintendo’s cease-and-desist manoeuvres are overly aggressive might want to reconsider their stance; they're still a far cry from toppling Capcom from the shutdown podium. There is little in the way of modern bonuses or extra modes here, just three difficulty settings to work through that save your progress and allow you to go back and revisit previously felled challengers. This works well if you’re struggling on a higher difficulty, allowing you to drop back to Rookie settings, for example, to learn the patterns more effectively.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Expectedly, not much.\nIn a recent interview with Famitsu, Hidemaro Fujibayashi was asked to comment on this very topic.

Unbeknownst to anyone until today, Nintendo’s latest console is going to be released in under two months, and with it the latest installment in The Legend of Zelda series, Breath of the Wild. A hush goes over the crowd as the final trailer begins: stunning graphics, innovative open-world gameplay, calamitous (literally) storytelling. Streamers and reactors around the world are in awe. They’re screaming, crying, cheering. Anticipation is through the roof for what will soon usher in a new wave of popularity for one of Nintendo’s most beloved franchises.\nStreaming on her own channel is former speedrunner Narcissa Wright. Many gamers will remember her famous 18:10 run of Ocarina of Time back in 2014, in which she set a new world record and quickly became one of the community’s most revered players. Then, she came out as transgender and was expeditiously abandoned by her community, including some of her most ardent fans. Wright has kept a low profile since then, streaming casual games to a smaller, more intimate audience. As she is moved to tears by the Breath of the Wild trailer, she sees the opportunity to stage a return to speedrunning and regain what was once hers. She logs onto Twitch and prepares to go live, captioning her stream with “I must surpass my past.”\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Any ship I abandon is essentially gone for good. \r\n\n\r\nMy first trophy as greenhorn orbital bandit Mary Read was a UC Transpo, which is essentially a shoebox with toilet roll tubes and detergent bottles glued to the outside, its ordnance limited to a single laser. I began my second leg confidently expecting to spend many hours in this Fisher Price starmobile, vainly searching for a wounded battlecruiser or an abandoned space yacht or some other, more capable vessel accessible to a space pirate of extremely modest means. This is going to be Jalopy: Galactic Edition, I said to myself. Imagine my shock (and slight disappointment) when I jumped to the very next planet and proceeded to comprehensively ding over a Crimson Fleet Spectre.\r\n\n \nRead more",

We got code late due to an unknown random happenstance, but we've now put a bunch of time into playing it so can have a blimmin' great chat about Bethesda's space RPG. I sound like I hate it, but don't. James actually likes it. Nate has not played it but he asks us about it.\nAs you might imagine, the field of stars also makes up the bulk of our What We've Been Playing this week, although Nate is considering whether to start that or Baldur's Gate 3 - we give conflicting answers... Plus, some interesting recommendations, and Garfield.\nRead more",

In truth, I was surprised (and somewhat saddened) by some of the comments we received around our Baldur's Gate 3 coverage. If you missed them, they were mostly in the vein of saying our increased volume of BG3-related posts felt like \"spam\", harking back to when we (and the internet at large) all went similarly bananas over Elden Ring last year. I know it can sometimes seem like writing about these games - particularly on RPS - feels like we're somehow neglecting everything else going on in PC gaming. But the truth is a little more complicated than that, so I wanted to take some time to talk a bit about this in this month's Letter From The Editor, because there are a number of reasons why this happens - and will probably continue to happen more generally as websites fight for survival.\nRead more",

In the case of Affogato, it’s three of my favourite types of games mashed together: it’s Coffee Talk by way of Persona by way of any card-based tower defence game – only here it’s sort of \"reverse tower defence\", as the game's Steam page is keen to point out. It's your own card units that are the ones moving along pre-defined tracks wreaking havoc on stationary enemies, not the other way around. Maybe tower assault would be a better term, but that's by the by. Served with a dollop of anime froth on the top, Affogato should be my exact cuppa joe. But despite its intriguing ingredients, I wouldn't say it's been wholly successful in slooshing them all together.\nRead more",

Granted, I'm a thirty-something in a country with a years-long housing crisis, so even the Baker House in Resident Evil 7 is of \"I think I could just about afford that one day\" status. But it comes to something when a 70s depresso-capsule at the bottom of the sea has more square footage and storage space than I do.\nUnder The Waves (which got patched today, and not before time because I've had one fatal error crash per play session since it came out last week so far) is about a deep sea diver called Stan, who is living and working at the bottom of a big wet metaphor for grief. You will know this because a) its Steam page says this up front, and b) it's not super subtle (this game is published by Quantic Dream). But, as newsman Edwin pointed out to me today, when was the last time the sea wasn't a metaphor for grief? It's never a metaphor for enjoying a nice raspberry ripple ice cream. And despite Stan making reference to \"what [he's] been through\" half an hour in, I think it does a great job with its chthonic sadness. You float about in your tiny little sub in a great misty darkness, listen to the extremely melancholy music, and you start thinking about sad stuff in your own life. But you get into Stan's capsule living area and you think \"this guy has a carpet and a book nook, what the hell?\"\nRead more",

The framing I'm working with instead, based on an hour of hands-off Rogue Trader gameplay, is that it's sort of Warhammer Mass Effect, but with XCOM-style turn- and grid-based combat, and while there are opportunities to be a compassionate hero, you fundamentally only have the option of playing Renegade.

          "description": "Lightyear Frontier is not the kind of game that fits neatly into a 30-minute Gamescom demo. There's so much to see and do in this laidback farming mech sim that by the time my demo ends, I barely feel like I've scratched the surface of it (and that's even with the assistance of some handy secret dev cheats to show me some of the structures and features they've got planned later on in the game). Rather, this is a game that's designed to unfurl slowly, bit by bit, over the course of several hours, and before we begin, developer Frame Break's CEO Joakim Hedström tells me they've shortened the game's opening sequence for this particular demo, just so they can get players right into the thick of things as quickly as possible. \nBut even on this whistlestop tour, there's plenty to dig into and delight in here - not least its gloriously bright and inviting colour palette (take that, Todd). I got to sample its farming, its wonderfully weighty mech exploration, and even indulge in a little bit of, well, powerwashing. Yep, PowerWash Simulator's influence was well and truly felt at this year's Gamescom, and I'm so very here for it.\nRead more",

And if you were planning to get it through PC Game Pass, that's another issue, as Game Pass games are locked down behind the fully Deck-incompatible Universal Windows Platform system. If the wonder of space depends on the it being a borderless infinity realm of endless possibilities, nobody told Microsoft.\nThere is a way, however, to sidestep both problems. Xbox Cloud Gaming will let you play Starfield on the Steam Deck at a steady (enough) 30fps, by streaming the game from Microsoft's cloud network direct to your screen - no Proton GE or Lutris launcher required. It still takes some setting up, but luckily, you’ve already clicked onto a step-by-step guide on how to do it.\nRead more",

          "description": "Ring the bell, everybody, it's time for another round of game developers telling players that they don't really understand what a \"game engine\" is. The spark this time is little-known science fiction adventure Starfield, which I believe we've reported on before. The game has a few obvious foibles - in my experience as a space pirate, NPCs sometimes struggle to navigate their surroundings, and then there are those stark disconnects between planetary surfaces and orbital space. Hiccups such as these have led a few players to wonder whether the game might work better using different technology, and in particular, the newer versions of Epic's ubiquitous Unreal Engine. Isn't Bethesda's proprietary Creation Engine, which the company have been updating since 2011, getting a little long in the tooth?\nYou'll find a lot of the discussion below this post from Digital Foundry boffin John Linneman on Twxter, which has attracted both gloating PlayStation fans (remember, Starfield is Xbox-only in console land) and a number of thoughtful replies from some fairly senior game developers. This conversation goes back a fair way, of course - people have been ragging on Bethesda for using \"the same engine\" for years. And there's a definite air of world-weariness to some of the developer responses.\r\n \nRead more",

By total coincidence - I promise you it's accidental, I was so pleased - I've been working on a \"land on no planets\" run of Starfield. The reasoning for this is as follows: people say that outer space is the worst part of the game, because it's just an irritating interval between the maps where the majority of quests, loot, intrigues, etc are found. It's a fast travel loading screen you can fly about in. But what if you double-down on the space stuff? \r\n\n\r\nWhat if you never descend from orbit, not even to repair, modify or upgrade your ship and offload inventory? What if, rather than buying new ships or building them, you progress exclusively by boarding other captains and making off with ship and cargo? How well does Starfield scrub up as a thoroughbred space sim that leans towards bloodthirsty piracy? Here to answer these questions is Mary Read, my custom character and budding astral freebooter. She's named for her distant ancestor, the legendary 18th century English buccaneer Mary Read. She's had a crack at life on shore, setting foot most recently on Earth's Moon, but from this point on, her fate and fortune lies amid the stars. Arrr!\r\n\n \nRead more",

The new title is a sokoban-style puzzle game, which is to say, it's broadly about shoving crates around, but as the name suggests, Void Stranger has bigger ambitions than helping you while away five minutes over lunch. It's a game of faith, amnesia and devilry, which reportedly portions out its secrets across multiple playthroughs. Here's a trailer.\n Read more",

It was actually my favourite act of the whole game - not that I doubt other people saw things going on the wonk a lot, but I did, thankfully, escape more or less unscathed (apart from one instance where, for some reason, Gale the smug sex wizard had a conversation with me, and then immediately repeated the exact same conversation). For me, the final act of BG3 is the act when all my nonsensing in the rest of the game paid off. The part where it turned out it did matter that I spent a painstaking hour separating and killing a bunch of guards in a mine, so I could save the gnomes trapped in a cave-in. It was also where a genie turned me into cheese.\nSpoilers, obvs, if you're that way inclined. \nRead more",

I'm especially grateful when us single player preferers get a knowing nod of acknowledgement in fighting games, too, which are so naturally geared toward pitting your skills against other human beings that anything involving playing against the AI is often either an afterthought or so threadbare that you can't help but feel like you're missing the point. \nBut that's still, for my sins, how I like to consume fighting games when I occasionally play them - which isn't often, I'll admit, for exactly the reasons described above - and so when I sat down for my Mortal Kombat 1 demo session at Gamescom this year, I was pleased to see not just a very slick story mode in attendance, but also a new single player challenge mode called Invasions that publishers Warner Bros described as \"a giant interactive board game\" that \"lent into action RPG\" territory. Its numerous node-based missions looked substantial based on what I played, and the idea of applying a seasonal service model to it, endlessly rotating in new locations and missions every so often - a whole different Invasion, so to speak - is actually something I'd be very much behind. It, that is, I was a) good at Mortal Kombat, and b) the missions I played during my demo weren't quite so… err… boring.\nRead more",

So it is with Starfield, which already has a DLSS mod ready to patch in the class-leading Nvidia upscaler that Bethesda left out in favour of AMD FSR 2.\nIt’s the work of seasoned modder PureDark, previously seen hammering both DLSS and FSR into Skyrim. I’ve tried the Starfield mod and it works rather nicely, granting a visible quality boost on RTX graphics cards while equalling FSR’s ability to smooth out Starfield’s sometimes-tricky performance. Unfortunately (and largely by association), it’s also been dragged into a spot of nasty business, one involving a separate mod for DLSS 3 frame generation and PureDark’s application of DRM.\nRead more",

And, god, I hated it so much.”\nIt’s weird, in fact, that Gaider wound up working on Baldur’s Gate II at all - let alone that he became synonymous with Dragon Age and romanceable companions afterwards. At 27 years old, he ran a hotel in Edmonton, Alberta - the same city where, unbeknownst to him, Bioware was busy making its name. Once it came time to make a sequel to Baldur’s Gate, Bioware cast around for local writers, and a friend recommended Gaider, who had played D&D in the ‘80s before it fell out of fashion.\nRead more",

Well, at the risk of empirically demonstrating that romance is dead, it turns out all that might have been down to a technical problem.

Space sim fanatics were dismayed to learn that you can't actually fly down to the surface of the planets you're orbiting - instead, you hit a button to initiate a loading break and a landing cutscene, which makes outer space feel more like a glorified airlock chamber than, well, outer space. This segmented approach has prompted many unflattering comparisons with No Man's Sky, in which you can manually pilot through the atmosphere. \r\n\n\r\nPlayers and critics were similarly disappointed by the apparent inability to manually fly between planets in different orbits - instead, the game invites you to pick a destination from your star map or while using your spaceship's scanner HUD, with the journey condensed to a cutscene, again. Well, I bring news on this front. You can actually fly \"to\" and perhaps even \"between\" planets in Starfield. But there are some buts. Buts of astronomical dimensions. Onward!\r\n\n \nRead more",

Now though, DDR5 manufacturers are also producing an intermediate 24GB size, allowing for 48GB kits of two sticks each.\nThis new capacity requires a BIOS update for most motherboards, but pricing on it can be quite good - and that's what we're seeing today, with extremely rapid DDR5-6400 CL36 RAM available in a 48GB capacity for $130 after a $18 price drop.  \nRead more",

Verne Colon The Shape Of Fantasy is, at least in part, an adventure game, and weaker for it. Taken as 'pure' interactive fiction, it'd be shorter and simpler, but might allow its premise, atmosphere, and intriguing world to shine the way they ought to.\r\n\n\r\nThe premise actually takes some explaining. Jules Verne himself takes the place of Aronnax, the protagonist of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Seas, and instead of mere hermitry, his new submarine home/prison is devoted to a guerrilla war against The Nation, a Prussian-ish empire you might be able to stop using a techno-magical gubbins that allows you to edit reality.

          "description": "Earlier this week I attended a hands-off preview for Owlcat's forthcoming CRPG Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, which is shaping up nicely, inasmuch as there's anything \"nice\" about a Warhammer 40,000 game. Rogue Trader is a party-based affair in which you play a sort of Warhammer East India Company, tasked with flipping outlying worlds to the Imperium. In order to carry out this goal, you're granted a lot more individual license than most human residents of the 40K universe. You can, for instance, recruit ungodly xenos to your grimdark troupe, operate a private armada, and even colonise planets and turn them into your own personal piggybank. Just watch you don't push the whole \"heresy\" thing too far.\r\n\n\r\nI'll have more for you on the subject soonish, but here's an interesting advance snippet from my interview with Owlcat's creative director Alexander Mishulin, in which we discussed what really distinguishes a CRPG from other kinds of role-playing game. According to Mishulin, it's all about designing for choices with consequences that genuinely run the entire length of the game, without (somehow) getting lost in the narrative undergrowth.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I felt it was so close, too close, to Bloodborne in everything from the cadence of the Chalamet puppet's jog, to the \"duhhnng\" noise of pickups, and the gothic sheen of its streets. At the time I thought it was a bit of a duff pretender, honestly.\nBut a good chunk of time with it at this year's Gamescom has swivelled my head back in its direction. Having clacked through some dingy streets, fired blue gloop from my arm, and fought the literal King Of Puppets, I've come to realise it has the potential to be a magnificent Soulslike in its own right.\nRead more",

          "description": "A quick heads-up for those of you hopping aboard the Starfield interstellar express today: there is a non-zero possibility that one of the game's elevators has a shark in it. That's according to Bethesda's head of publishing Pete Hines, who encountered the displaced piscine trouble-maker while playing the game before release. He's \"almost positive\" the shark isn't there any more - and just like that, my understanding of Starfield has been transformed. This isn't a 150 hour RPG treadmill of resource extraction, artefact investigation and base-building, wherein you give spaceship tours and put +5% on your accuracy, or what-have-you. It's an extremely slowburn horror game, with every innocent elevator potentially housing a Great White jumpscare. All of which, Hines feels, is true to how Bethesda \"embraces chaos\" in their games, though he does feel the company's popular association with jank and bugs isn't \"particularly fair\".\nRead more",

It’s a chunky lad compared to its peers, weighing 854g and packing an 8.8in display, but promises a bigger battery and – most interestingly – a pair of Nintendo Switch-style detachable controllers.\r\n\n\r\nThese are partly intended to simply give your wrists a rest, setting the Legion Go down on its (also Switch-esque) integrated kickstand while you play with the loose controllers. The right pad, mind, also includes an optical sensor on the bottom, so you can swish it around a desk like a vertical mouse. Potentially a difference-maker for FPS games? We won’t need to wait long to find out, as the Legion Go is launching on October 31st. It’ll cost a surprisingly un-spooky £699 / $699.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I don't remember this at the time, but there were complaints about Skyrim's map when it came out, because it was just an extreme zoom out on the world. It wasn't dense with information; the map markers were often kind of an \"it's in this area\" guideline that were even less helpful if what you needed was in a barrow or otherwise underground. Starfield raises the bar by taking the bold step of having a map that is almost not a map.\nI'm referring here to the planet surface map. The starmap is, like a couple of things I've experienced since being hustled through quite an accelerated inciting incident (Starfield's equivalent of Patrick Stewart dying in a sewer after he's charged you with saving the world), reminiscent of Mass Effect. You can select different galaxies, which have one or two solar systems in them, and then can zoom down and select specific planets or moons or whatever to warp to. Once you're wombling about on the surface being a naughty little space captain - or whatever, I don't judge what you're up to - well baby, I hope you like blue voids with a bit of topography.\nRead more",

          "description": "Over the past week, dataminers have been rifling through Baldur's Gate 3's code and have discovered a dragon's hoard of alleged \"cut content\". It's hard to specify what they've unearthed without accidentally sounding the Major Spoilers trumpet and initiating Armageddon, but the supposed buried offerings include additional areas, swathes of dialogue, storylines, cutscenes, characters, romance opportunities and even deities. Given just how much Larian's gargantuan RPG gives you to play with, I am kind of thankful for a generous amount of stuff being \"left out\" - certainly, I don't need any more romanceable NPCs, I'm already fending them off with a broomhandle. But the news has gone down badly with a few players, and especially those who feel the game's overall quality takes a dive in acts 2 and 3.\r\n\n\r\nDevelopers have come to Larian's defence, amongst them David Gaider, former Baldur's Gate 2 and Dragon Age writer, who is nowadays creative director of Summerfall Games, creator of the very earwormy STRAY GODs: The Roleplaying Musical. \"Not surprised to hear of the amount of stuff apparently cut from BG3,\" Gaider wrote on Twix. \"BG2 had a mountain of stuff cut over its development, some early and some even after lots of work had gone into it... almost every game does. Every DA game did. Heck, even Stray Gods had some considerable cuts.\"\r\n\n \nRead more",

The sinks are full of gunk and there are children hiding in the cupboards. Oh, and the darker stretches of floor are covered with writhing tentacles. This is Holstin, a Polish survival horror experience in which you merrily rove an isolated town that, based on 14 minutes of fumbling around in exactly one very unwelcoming house, already seems a match for Silent Hill in terms of existential squalor. A public playtest is underway, and I've got a trailer for you through the jump.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Officially unveiled at this week's Panic Games Showcase, Arco is a triptych of revenge stories set across the deserts, plains and forests of a fantastical, South American-style landscape. It's a part of the world we don't often get to see in games, and its stunning pixel art (and tiny cute little llamas) instantly caught my eye when I got to play an early mission from it at last week's Gamescom. Made by four developers spread across the globe, the official genres listed on its Steam page describe it as a tactical turn-based action adventure RPG where you guide four separate heroes in their fight against the ominous sounding Red Company. But just saying it's turn-based is doing Arco a disservice, I think, as it's also a little bit real-time, a little bit simultaneous turns, and all pretty brilliant, if you ask me. Here are some very early impressions of it.\nRead more",

It just submits reports of bad behaviour, with Activision staff making the final call on enforcement actions, which might involve reviewing recordings to work out the context of an outburst.\nYou can turn off voice chat in Call of Duty to avoid being recorded, but it doesn't look like there's a way to opt out of AI voice moderation in the current/new Call of Duty games at the time of writing. The tech is being beta-tested from today, 30th August in Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone in North America, with the English-language worldwide release to land alongside Modern Warfare 3 on 10th November. \r\n\n \nRead more",

A na scheduleru systému je, aby úlohy rozhazoval jádrům pokud možno optimálně, tedy například i v situacích, kdy je sice nejlepší jádro CPU volné, ale úloha běží na jiném CCX modulu v jiném segmentu L3 cache a její přesun tam a zpět by byl horší než nechat úlohu doběhnout na jiném, ale bližším CPU jádru, případně existuje vhodnější CPU jádro z hlediska parametrů frekvence a napětí pro danou frekvenci.",

          "description": "It sounds like a new successor to the Switch could be approaching. New reports out of Gamescom 2023 say Nintendo showed off Switch 2 tech demos to developers behind closed doors.\nEurogamer reports these presentations took place to show off the technical specs of a potential Switch successor, or \"Switch 2\" as we'll call it. In its own reporting of the news, VGC corroborates with its sources.\nPer Eurogamer, the developer presentations were shown tech demos. One included a souped-up The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. VGC's source also claims Nintendo showcased Epic's The Matrix Awakens tech demo for Unreal Engine 5, reportedly utilizing Nvidia DLSS upscaling.\nNintendo has not formally announced any plan for a new Switch successor. Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser recently spoke to IGN, saying he's \"stopped counting years\" when it comes to the Switch's ongoing life cycle. And Nintendo did not comment on Eurogamer's report.\nEven with the radio silence, though, Switch 2 rumors are brewing. A previous report pointed towards a launch in the second half of 2024. Eurogamer says this lines up with what it previously heard, though Nintendo may be keen to launch sooner.\nWith tech demos apparently going around, we may actually be getting close to a new Switch.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHGShqcAHlQ\nThe long road here\nOf course, there's still some gas in the tank for the modern Nintendo Switch. The handheld hybrid is just over six years old at this point, but it's still got some games hitting this holiday season. Namely, there's the Super Mario RPG remake, a new WarioWare, and the Style Savvy crew's next game, Fashion Dreamer. Plus, a ton of Pokémon DLC is in the works too.\nAdd that onto a year where the Switch got both Tears of the Kingdom and Pikmin 4, and it's not a bad swan song if a Switch 2 is cresting over the horizon. We'll have to see what Nintendo's got in store.\nThe post Nintendo reportedly demoed Switch 2 for developers at Gamescom 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Despite its simple mechanics and SNES-like aesthetics (or perhaps because of them), Stardew Valley is one of the most beloved indie games to come out in recent years. As such, fans have been keen on whether developer Eric \"ConcernedApe\" Barone can follow this with the upcoming game, Haunted Chocolatier.\nNot much is known about their next project, but Barone recently posted an image from the new title. It doesn't show much, but it's a kind of tease, and it's giving people Stardew Valley vibes.\nhttps://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1699121826948079851\nFeaturing the visual style of ConcernedApe's magnum opus, the screenshot shows an unnamed, wizened man who says they were \"just having the most terrible dream.\" Under this image on Twitter, some have commented that it reminds them of Grandpa from Stardew Valley. One person theorized that the new game is set in the same universe and Grandpa has gifted a chocolate shop instead of a farm.\nHe's not dead, he's just sleeping\nWe don't know a great deal about Haunted Chocolatier, other than you'll be running a confectionary place. It's also going for that Harvest Moon-inspired look, which worked out well for Stardew.\nAlongside the new project, Barone is also working on update 1.6 for Stardew Valley, so it's clearly going to be a busy time for them. We may not hear about the new game for a while longer.\nHowever, that doesn't stop people from asking when the new update for Stardew is likely to drop. The developer says they \"don't want any pressure,\" so we'll all have to be a little patient before we hear further details about Haunted Chocolatier.\nThe post Stardew Valley creator posts tease from upcoming new game, Haunted Chocolatier appeared first on Destructoid.",

Now it's been declared that Bethesda's anticipated sci-fi RPG has surpassed one million concurrent players.\nThat's according to a recent Twitter post from Head of Xbox, Phil Spencer. According to the exec, this number was \"exceeded\" today, just one day after Starfield's full release. It should be noted that this is across all platforms. And by \"all platforms,\" he means the two that the game is available on.\nhttps://twitter.com/XboxP3/status/1699621881421471889\nIt shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that it's doing incredibly well, especially so soon after it launched. In fact, if you look at the data on SteamDB, you can see that over 170,000 people are currently playing on PC at the time of writing. Of course, these numbers are changing all the time and could easily spike once we hit the weekend.\nSucks to be any other game releasing this month\nAfter more than a decade of being in the pipeline (from Todd Howard's initial pitch to the final release), the hype seems to be worth it. Starfield is receiving great reviews pretty much across the board.\nIt's got its faults, of course. It's a Bethesda game after all, but one that seems less buggy than things like Skyrim or Fallout 76. In the end, one million concurrent players across Steam and Xbox is a mighty milestone, even for the big guns of the gaming world.\nRight. That's the Starfield stuff done.

Black Tabby Games will unleash Slay the Princess on October 20, 2023 for PC, Mac, and Linux via Steam.\nBlack Tabby Games has already made itself known in the horror space through Scarlet Hollow, and Slay the Princess looks to be pretty terrifying in its own way. The general idea is that you wake up in some woods, driven by the disembodied voice of the Narrator (Jonathan Sims from The Magnus Archives) to slay the princess. Doing so, he says, will save the world.\nBut what do you choose to do when you reach her cabin? Do you pick up the knife and bring it down? Do you try to talk things out with the princess, voiced by Nichole Goodnight, or simply do what you're told? And what if you've been here before?\nWithout saying too much, the narrative starts to twist and shift in ways you can already see in the newest release date trailer:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY07Vh7MEbg\nMore than a princess\nThe draw of Slay the Princess, as we've seen in demos here, is how its narrative threads weave and intersect to reflect decisions. Slay the Princess is, essentially, about trust. And depending on what you've already done, the princess may warp to reflect your actions, as you also try to comprehend just what is going on in this place.\nSome really sharp writing and incredible art work, complemented by the fully voice-acted lineup, really makes Slay the Princess shine. Its focus on creating an exact vibe and idea earned it a spot on our list of favorite games from PAX East 2023.\nSuffice to say, I'm looking forward to this one, and October is the perfect month for it. Black Tabby also confirms Slay the Princess is coming to Steam Deck, so the terror can go on-the-go, too.

          "description": "Atari has announced that the Sneakybox-developed tactical RPG, Days of Doom, now has a release date of September 21, 2023. That’s soon! The news was revealed as part of Feardemic’s Fear Fest 2023.\nOkay, are you sitting down? It’s a roguelite. But, hey, I think it looks pretty good. I typically won’t tell you about the games that don’t show any promise at all. I’m protecting you. I’m a hero.\nAnyway, Days of Doom has you leading a group of apocalypse survivors to “Sanctuary,” the aptly named happy place amongst all the death and decay. Rather than just being a zombie pandemic, it looks like the Earth is being torn apart by Hell itself, so beyond just zombies, you fight all manner of ghouls. There’s a supernatural element to everything, so one of the recruitable party members is a hydromancer and can manipulate water.\nhttps://youtu.be/eMLRyW1PA-E?feature=shared\nDays of Doom features a permanent progression system, where you build up the abilities and capacity of your party to continually make your next run more likely to succeed. You know, just like a roguelite. It puts focus on figuring out how each of the 8 types of heroes function and how it they can be used in strategies together.\nFor the past few years, Sneakybox has largely been working on Atari’s Recharged series of remakes, the most recent one being Quantum: Recharged. While those are interesting, I’m looking forward to seeing them get back to different genres and see how the skills they’ve built up get applied.\nDays of Doom is coming to PC, Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and even Atari VCS it releases on September 21, 2023.\nThe post Atari’s apocalypse survival RPG Days of Doom shambles out September 21 appeared first on Destructoid.",

If they are, then you can not only stream via Discord, but you can join voice channels directly from your console. \nIn addition, the most recent update brings with it the inclusion of Variable Refresh Rate (VRR), a feature that can give players “a smooth, artifact-free experience” while they play their favorite titles, according to the official blog post detailing the September update. It’s also easier to use the rewards you’ve accumulated. If you’re looking for your rewards post-update, press the Xbox button on your controller, select Profile & System, navigate to your profile, and select My Rewards.\nThe update also brings with it the ability to request a spot in a friend’s party, the option to report voice incidents that might be offensive to some, a new way to receive wishlist notifications, a new way to pair your controller to your console without having to get up, and an update to the Xbox app on PC. \nHow to use Discord on Xbox\nHere's how to use Discord on your Xbox console:\nPress the Xbox button via your controller.\nNavigate to Parties & Chats.

This will put smaller developers in the spotlight on December 6th in a livestream as part of the weeklong Game Awards celebration.\nUgh, I hate to be reminded of the Game Awards. Part of my distaste for them is because they make such a token effort to recognize smaller developers who make contributions to the industry. The difference between a AAA game and everything else isn’t quality; it’s budget. The Game Awards feels like an extension of the corporate side of gaming, where indies are seen more as a crucible for ideas that might be profitable on a larger level.\nDay of the Devs, on the other hand, is a bit easier to appreciate. It’s helmed by Double Fine and iam8bit, who at least have an appreciation for the artistry in gaming. The Day of the Devs: Game Awards Edition also allows anyone to submit their games for consideration (before September 20th) without a financial barrier for entry.\nThe form doesn’t really define what they consider “indie,” which is a bit concerning since people apply the label pretty widely these days. Dave the Diver, for example, is often described as indie production. But the developer, Mintrocket, is a division of Nexon Korea Corporation, which has a net income in the billions.\nSo, here’s hoping that Day of the Devs: Game Awards Edition recognizes some hot indie games that actually need it. As a note, the usual Day of the Devs show that normally takes place in San Francisco in November is being pushed back a few months to early 2024.\nDay of the Devs: Game Awards Edition will livestream on December 6th, 2023. The Game Awards proper follows after on December 7, 2023.\nThe post Day of the Devs: Game Awards Edition will highlight indies alongside the big awards show appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "In an interview with Famitsu, Nintendo Producer Eiji Aonuma, and Director Hidemaro Fujibayashi confirmed that The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom will not be receiving any new content or DLC. Genki_JPN on Twitter translated the interview:\n\"We have no plans to release additional content this time, but that is because we feel like we have done all we can do to create play in that world,\" Aonuma told Famitsu. \"This time, the reason we decided to make a sequel to the previous game in the first place was because we thought it would be worth experiencing new ways to play in Hyrule. If such reasons arise then we may return to the same world. Whether it is a sequel or new work, I think it will be a completely new way to play, so I hope you will look forward to it. We are very grateful that so many customers have been playing Tears of the Kingdom for so long and deeply, so we will to do our best to make the next title even more enjoyable.\"\n\nHonestly, it's no surprise that Nintendo feels Tears of the Kingdom is essentially finished. After all, our very own Chris Carter gave the sequel a 10/10 when it was released on May 12, 2023. In comparison, Breath of the Wild only received one expansion pass that included three DLC packs. While the DLC packs were good, they weren't quite on par with BotW itself.\nZelda fans have reason to rejoice, though. Based on the interview, it seems like Nintendo is opting to jump right into the next Zelda title. Maybe going this route we won't have to wait five years for the next one! With the Switch successor reportedly planned for 2024, the time may be better spent working wit the new dev kits.\nThe post Nintendo has no plans for additional Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom content appeared first on Destructoid.",

New maps and modes will coincide with the character's entry into the game. There's no word of Spyro making the roster as of yet. However, the purple dragon's 25th anniversary looms later this month.\nRipto will be the first Spyro the Dragon character to join the multiplayer game Crash Team Rumble. On September 12, Season 2 of the competitive multiplayer game will include a new mode called Party Mode (which has mini-games) and additional maps such as Waste Deep. The map is inspired by the level Cortex Castle from Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time. A Halloween event is likely to occur as well as there's candy with a Jack-o-Lantern's face on it (via CanadianGuyEh) in the official Season 2 picture.\n[caption id=\"attachment_402353\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1200\"] Image via the Crash Bandicoot Twitter[/caption]\nMany expected the protagonist, Spyro the Dragon, to be first in line for the party game. He has appeared in Crash Team Racing: Nitro-Fueled as a playable character in the past. There's no confirmation of Spyro's introduction to Crash Team Rumble yet, but it seems to be only a matter of time in fans' eyes. Regardless, it's exciting for many to have Ripto in Crash Team Rumble. \nRipto is the main villain from 1999's Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage. He's a dinosaur who craves power and will take it by any means. He also utilizes magic as part of his arsenal, like fire and poisonous attacks.\nSpyro the Dragon recently hit a big sales milestone as his 25th anniversary draws near. The Spyro Reignited Trilogy, which has the original trio of games remade, has sold over 10 million copies since 2018. At the time of writing, you can buy the game for 75% off on Steam.

And now, the first episode of Paldean Winds has been released for free via the official Pokemon channel on YouTube.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyMxQl-PeJE\nThe episode, which is entitled “Breathe Out,” clocks in at around 11 minutes in length and follows Ohara, a student at Naranja Academy. Ohara is a flutist who has been asked to create a video project celebrating the school’s legacy with fellow students Aliquis and Hohma. But, due to a staggering amount of pressure, Ohara journeys to Glaceado Mountain with her loyal Fuecoco companion in search of her treasure.\nThe series will have a total of four episodes and is produced by WIT STUDIO, who eagle-eyed anime fans will recognize as the team behind the first three seasons of Attack on Titan as well as one of the studios behind the smash hit SPY x FAMILY. In the Pokemon world, WIT STUDIO also produced the three-episode miniseries, Pokemon: Hisuian Snow.\nI’d hate to spoil the episode too severely, but given it’s already dubbed into English, we now have official voices for several characters from Scarlet and Violet: Nemona, Arven, and Clavell. Nemona is voiced by Olivia Vidas, Arven by Henry Mason, and Clavell is voiced by Pete Zarustica. In terms of main cast, Ohara is voiced by Cat Protano, Aliquis by Paul Castro Jr., and Hohma by Caroline Spinola.\nIf you’d like to get on-board the Paldean Winds train while it’s still early, the first episode is available for free via YouTube.

From the == brief meme-ry of Choo-Choo Charles to every new game getting a mod where you play as the iconic children’s character. \nIt would appear the recently released Armored Core VI is no exception to that, as a user on NexusMods has released a mod entitled “Thomas the Tank Engine Wheelchair Swap.” And, speaking unironically, it doesn’t even look that bad. \n“Thomas the Tank Engine Wheelchair Swap,” created by NexusMods user ScrubMilk, is meant to replace “the EL-TL-11 FORTALEZA legs with Thomas the Tank Engine,” according to the original post. But users who want a pristine, unparalleled mod experience might want to look elsewhere, as ScrubMilk makes it abundantly clear this is nothing but a fun, silly meme mod for laughs.\nHow to install mods in Armored Core VI\nIf we haven’t lost you yet, and you’d like to install the Thomas the Tank Engine mod for your next Armored Core VI run, look no further. While those familiar with Nexus may use its automated install option, Vortex, that's not a route you can take here. Instead, you'll need to manually adjust or use another third-party program, Mod Engine. \nAccording to ScrubMilk, this mod can be installed using Mod Engine 2.1, which makes it remarkably easy to install the mod into your instance of Armored Core VI. Download the mod from NexusMods, unzip it, and then drop the folder labeled “parts” into Mod Engine’s “mod\" directory. You can then launch the mod by running the file named “launchmod_armoredcore6.bat.”\nWhile plenty of mods are all tongue-in-cheek, recent AAA releases are popping off with user-generated content. Games like Starfield have already hosted their own thriving collections, including handy tweaks like a free DLSS3 mod. Baldur's Gate 3 also joins that list with several fan additions that streamline some in-game systems.\nThe post A Thomas the Tank Engine mod has finally come to Armored Core 6 appeared first on Destructoid.",

I was so taken aback that I said \"Holy Sh*t!\" - He immediately took me aside and asked me not to post the video, as it would be inappropriate for children. We ended up posting it anyway, with my swear bleeped out, and it was a cute, hopefully inoffensive bit of fun. But what I really took away from that moment is how much Charles Martinet cares about his fans. He wants to fill their hearts with hope and joy, and not whatever the opposite of those two things is. That may be why we still haven't heard exactly why he's no longer the voice of Mario in the games.\nThis video posted yesterday from Galaxy Con Austin is the closest we've come to gettin…",

          "description": "It may not be perfectly timed with the film's release, but a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem game is in the works. Outright Games announced plans to launch what is essentially a sequel to the theatrical outing sometime in 2024. Specific platforms haven't been revealed yet, but look for the Mutant Mayhem game to make its way to consoles and PC. \nAccording to the announcement (via Gematsu), Outright Games is looking to match the film's \"bold, painterly art style\" with its visuals. As for its sequel status, this one will be set months after the events of the film, so we'll get to see what the heroes in a half shell get up to next. This will, at the very least, involve saving New York City from a new mutant threat. Mutants gotta stop messin' with NYC, man. \nBIG APPLE, 3 AM\nEverything else we can expect from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem game is anyone's guess. Outright Games has a history with licensed Nickelodeon games, from Star Trek Prodigy: Supernova to the upcoming PAW Patrol World. At the very least, both Outright and Paramount are aware of how important the film's aesthetic is to its success. As Paramount senior vice president of games and emerging media Doug Rosen noted, \"The vibrancy of this new film's animation lends itself perfectly to video games.\"\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem opened on August 2, 2023. The Jeff Rowe-directed film has proven to be profitable (before merchandise is taken into account), netting over $152 million at the global box office. Hopefully whatever Outright Games is cooking up can match its idiosyncratic flavor. It has some tough and similarly nostalgic acts to follow! \nThe post Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem game announced, takes place after the movie appeared first on Destructoid.",

Of course, this is great news for the players and modders, but the discussion surrounding Starfield mods hasn't been totally innocuous from the start. In fact, it was marked with the issue of one modder charging good money for a DLSS3 frame generation mod. That, however, should no longer be a huge concern, as a full-fledged alternative has already been developed.\nIndeed, modder LukeFZ has published their own Starfield Frame Generation mod on the Nexus modding page.

          "description": "The time has come, it would seem, for Bethesda to rid Doom Eternal of one of its biggest faults: the infamous Denuvo DRM. Having launched in March of 2020, Doom Eternal featured one of the most tone-deaf implementations of Denuvo yet, hyping the DRM up as a \"feature\" via official channels. Subsequently, there was some amount of backpedaling from id Software on the topic with a temporary removal of the DRM, but Denuvo did eventually come back into the picture due to the game's multiplayer mode. Now, three years following that particular series of stumbles, Doom Eternal no longer appears to have Denuvo on board.\nThis information comes from SteamDB, as highlighted by the community over at the r/Games subreddit.

          "description": "Today is officially Starfield Day. Those who have been paying even the slightest bit of attention will have seen the sheer amount of mods that have been coming out even before Bethesda's new game was properly released. Now there's one available that's very much for those who don't want the grind.\nOver on Nexus Mods, user ADITYAPAT86 has created and uploaded a very simple script for Starfield that saves all that levelling-up nonsense. By installing this mod, you'll be granted every single perk in the game, as well as having your character's level set to 328.\n[caption id=\"attachment_402243\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"] Image via Bethesda/Steam.[/caption]\nNow, while it does say that this mod maxes out your level, some of you will be quick to point out that Starfield apparently doesn't have a level cap. Still, being bumped up to 328 without doing anything is definitely a leap!\nAll Starfield but without all that work\nYou might question why someone would want to skip past all the necessary work needed to advance in a role-playing game, but that's the modding community for you. Already we're seeing hundreds of custom mods for Starfield coming out in quick succession. More are definitely on the way, especially now that the game is out fully.\nVery much like it has been with Skyrim, there are going to be so many people who won't want to play the vanilla version of Bethesda's space-faring RPG. Perish the thought! With that in mind, it's only a matter of time until someone blends the sci-fi aesthetic of Starfield with the fantasy lore of The Elder Scrolls.

          "description": "It's tough to make a name for yourself in the video game world, especially on platforms like Steam. Countless studios are vying for your attention (and money), but recent data shows that if you use certain words in your game's title, you might have a bit of an edge.\nThat's according to the latest newsletter from GameDiscoverCo (as spotted by PCGamer), a website that chronicles \"how people discover and buy video games.\" It seems as though there's a correlation between certain words used and revenue generated. For example: Steam games that feature the word \"HD\" or \"manager\" earn a median revenue of around $63,000 and $33,000, respectively.\n[caption id=\"attachment_402213\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"] Image via GameDiscoverCo.[/caption]\nPerhaps unsurprisingly in this era, \"remastered\" yields an average of £32,000 income, while \"gold\" and \"pro\" can earn your game around $11,000 and $16,000, respectively.\nThat explains why the Tycoon series is so popular\nThe study contains a list of over 200 words that are used in Steam game titles. A breakdown from GameDiscoverCo reveals some interesting facts about these findings. For example: the median average across the board is \"worryingly low.\" However, this is almost certainly due to how popular and busy Steam is.\nAdaptations tend to generate more revenue, so the aforementioned \"HD,\" \"remastered,\" \"pro,\" and \"gold\" seem more likely to do well than games that have words like \"ball,\" \"maze,\" or \"jump\" in them. This may be due to them being more simple or generic words.\nThe analysis also looked at how frequently words cropped up in games. What you'll see from the above graph is just how many studios want to put the word \"dead\" into their titles.\nSomething to think about if you're looking to release your next Steam game: Dead Manager: The Ultimate Tycoon Pro (HD, Remastered)\nThe post Steam analysis shows games that use certain words tend to earn more revenue appeared first on Destructoid.",

Nitara is making her long-awaited return, and it’s such a big homecoming that NetherRealm has enlisted actress Megan Fox to voice her.\nNitara is a vampire that made her debut in 2002’s Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance. She’s only been playable in a couple of entries, had a small cameo in Mortal Kombat 11, and appeared in the 2021 Mortal Kombat film. Despite having only a few appearances to her name, she’s endured as favorite among fans who grew up with the 2000s era, and she looks as deadly as ever in MK 1. \nMegan Fox brings Nitara to life, and you can get a sample of her performance in the trailer below. “I grew up playing Mortal Kombat and I can’t believe that I’m voicing a character in the new game,\" Fox says in a press release. \"It’s an honor to be a part of one of the greatest video game legacies of all time.” Given that Ronda Rousey voiced Sonya Blade in MK 11, it’s not surprising to see NetherRealm rope in another celebrity to perform one of its kombatants. \n\n\nMortal Kombat 1 launches on September 19 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Check out our latest hands-on impressions of its Invasions and Story Mode here. Be sure to also watch the game's most recent trailer from Gamescom 2023.",

There’s no word yet on if the film’s ensemble cast will reprise their roles.\nIn terms of gameplay, a press release only hints that the project involves “combining energetic ninja teamwork gameplay with a humorous narrative, players will take control of the Turtles as they interact with a host of memorable characters from the franchise and fight to save this stylized take on New York City from a new mutant threat.” Outright Games has experience working on games based on kid-friendly licenses, making titles based on Star Trek: Prodigy, How to Train Your Dragon, Paw Patrol, and Peppa Pig. \nThe TMNT: Mutant Mayhem game is targeting PC and consoles. It’s the latest project in what’s been quite a renaissance for the Turtles, especially in video games. The resurgence kicked off with last year’s well-received TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge, which recently got a big new expansion. The Cowabunga Collection bundled nearly every classic TMNT game into one package for a modern audience. A single-player action game based on the beloved TMNT: The Last Ronin graphic novel is also in the works.",

It launches on September 29 and takes players into \"The Mind Trap.\" \nBecause it's an Apple Arcade game, it will require a subscription. But after subscribing, the game is technically free-to-play and will feature zero microtransactions, like all Apple Arcade games. In it, you'll be able to unlock new gadgets and weapons, build resources, collect outfits and new character models from across the franchise, and more. \nCheck out the Cypher 007 teaser trailer for yourself below: \n\n\n\"The criminal mastermind Blofeld and head of Spectre has once again hatched a plan to sabotage his archenemy James Bond,\" the game's description reads. \"This time, he has utilized brainwashing techniques known as 'The Mind Trap,' holding Bond captive in a mental prison in an attempt to turn him into the ultimate double agent. Play as Agent 007 on his most challenging missions yet – escape the Mind Trap, defeat Blofeld, and put an end to the Cypher program.\" \nBecause it's a 007 game, you'll run into other MI6 operatives like Q, M, and Moneypenny, all while completing levels that increase in difficulty as you progress. You can compete against other players, too. \n\nCypher 007 hits Apple Arcade later this month on September 29.",

Instead of inviting players back to Derceto on October 25, the survival horror adventure will now arrive on January 16.\nIn a press release, developer Pieces Interactive offers a candid explanation for the move: it doesn’t want the game to compete with October’s heavy hitters like Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and another big horror game, Alan Wake 2. \n“Our intention is to avoid competing with the wake of Alan's epic release and to evade the dazzling skyline of cities adorned by the graceful swings of Spider-Man,\" Pieces writes. \"We aim to truly remain as Alone in the Dark as possible. To honor this, the spine-chilling horror game has been rescheduled to unveil its horrors on January 16th, 2024. This extension will serve a dual purpose: not only will it permit us to meticulously perfect the gaming experience, but it will also grant us the opportunity to fully immerse ourselves in the remarkable releases of October.”\nThe studio also released a new trailer starring David Harbour’s Edward Carnby, one of the game’s protagonists, showing off his performance and impressive facial capture. \n\n\nAlone in the Dark is a modernized revamp of the 1992 survival horror classic that stars actors Jodie Comer and David Harbour as protagonists Emily Hartwood and detective Edward Carnby, respectively. Players control one character to explore the haunted Derceto hospital to solve a sinister mystery, with both scenarios offering different story threads and moments. You can read our full preview of the game here. It will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

It also highlights that parts of the game are playable as an isometric, third-person shooter like last year’s Signalis and as an over-the-shoulder third-person shooter like in Capcom’s recent Resident Evil remakes. \nCheck out the Holstin gameplay reveal trailer for yourself below: \n\n\n“A psychological survival horror game set in an eerie, isolated 90’s Polish town consumed by an ominous presence,” the Holstin Steam page reads. “You’ve come looking for answers, but everyone seems possessed by something foul. Explore the festering town, interrogate locals, and fight ungodly manifestations to get to the truth.” \nThere’s no release date in sight for Holstin, but you can try the game for yourself today through a demo available on Steam right now. \nHolstin is set to release one day on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.\nFor more scary games, read Game Informer’s list of the top 10 horror games to play right now, and then read our list of the top 25 horror games of all time after that.",

I’m roughly 23 hours in, so I still have many galaxies ahead of me, but read Game Informer’s Starfield review for in-depth thoughts on the overall package. With years of build-up and anticipation, I, like many Bethesda Game Studios fans, let my imagination run wild with what this new open world RPG could be. Now that I’ve played a decent chunk of it, it’s quite different from the studios’ Elder Scrolls and Fallout series in some ways. Those two franchises are significantly more open world than Starfield. In fact, Starfield feels more like a great sci-fi theme park with exciting points of interests rather than an open world adventure.

Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. \nAfter 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon.

It means the opening hours of the game can be particularly confusing, but the tips below, gathered by the Game Informer staff, should help alleviate at least some confusion you might be experiencing early in the game.\nStay On The Main Path, At Least For Awhile\nStarfield lets you loose pretty quickly, and it is tempting to just start planet hopping right away, but you will do yourself a favor by sticking to the main path for at least a few hours. Our suggestion is that you play at least enough Constellation missions to find a mysterious temple. It may feel restrictive to hold yourself back, but you will be grateful to give yourself the time to learn…",

It also revealed that each subscription tier of PlayStation Plus is getting a significant price bump.\nThe PlayStation Blog reveals that September’s free games will be 2022’s Saints Row, Black Desert - Traveler Edition, and Generation Zero. They’ll become available on September 5 and can be downloaded until October 2.\nOn September 6, 12-month subscriptions for PlayStation Plus Essential, Extra, and Premium will be raised to the following prices:\nEssential - $79.99 (from $59.99)\nExtra - $134.99 (from $99.99)\nPremium - $159.99 (from $119.99)\nYou can read this article for a refresher on the benefits of each subscription tier, which will not be changing. Current 12-month subscribers will not see these prices take effect until their next renewal date occurring on or after November 6. Changing your membership (such as buying more time or upgrading/downgrading tiers) on or after September 6 means paying the new prices, though. Sony also states that the new prices remain at a discounted rate compared to the single or three-month options. Sony has not revealed the new monthly/quarterly rates.\nIn the blog post, Sony explains the changes by stating, “This price adjustment will enable us to continue bringing high-quality games and value-added benefits to your PlayStation Plus subscription service.” It’s worth noting that, for now, Sony has not announced any new, additional benefits following the pricing updates.\nThe move comes at a time when several streaming and subscription services have raised their fees, so it’s not entirely surprising. But if you’re looking to sign up for PS Plus or extend/change a subscription, now would be the time in order to save some money.",
