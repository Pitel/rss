It's hard to say, but without Baer's work as an inventor and pioneer that developed the first video game console for the home with the Magnavox Odyssey, the industry would look very different today.\nBorn in Germany on 8th March 1922, Baer and his family moved to America when he was a teenager. Baer signed up to the National Radio Institute as a radio service technician, and graduated in 1940. Just three years later, he was drafted into the army to fight in World War II, where he served in military intelligence.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

In Valhalla this manifests as protagonist Eivor, Viking raider and big blonde buff meat sculpture, being the reincarnation of Odin, one of the aforementioned god-people. Dawn Of Ragnarök is Eivor dreaming that they are Odin for about 35 hours of adventuring and son-saving in the magical realm of Svartalfheim. That's a pretty intense nap.\nRead more",

Its combat and economy chains build on each other, a feat uncommon in the real-time strategy space. Despite taking cues from beloved franchises like WarCraft and Age of Empires, TFC carves out a niche with an unlikely ally: pomegranates. The Fertile Crescent trades the ol’ berry bush for pomegranate trees, a native of Western Asia.\r\n\n\r\nDevelopers Anders Groenningsaeter and André Read from Wield Interactive looked to the past as they refined The Fertile Crescent’s economy. “Since childhood, André and I have been equally fascinated by RTS games and the Bronze Ages,” Groenningsaeter explained to me. “How we’ve been inspired by history has shaped the game. During the Bronze Ages, the usage of coins hadn’t taken root yet. It was still to a large extent a barter economy, and food played an important role.”\r\n\n \nRead more",

I've said before I've never been much of a Soulsite, and it's not for lack of trying. I tried my darnedest to get into Dark Souls III when it first came out, but holy deathrattles, it was such a long, gruelling slog. Vordt of the Boreal Valley, the second (yes, second) boss of Dark Souls III, remains my lifelong nemesis. I just couldn't get past it. I'm someone who always likes to be making forward, tangible progress when I play games, and banging my head against the same boss for hours on end is my idea of actual hell.\nI'm no better at playing Elden Ring, to be honest. I spent a good couple of hours last night just trying to get past one of those big tentacle-beard monkey lads with the hollowed out stomachs on the way up to Stormveil Castle. Not even a named, actual sub-boss! And yet, I'm actually enjoying this version of Souls-style head-bashing a lot more than I've ever done before. And I think it's to do with Elden Ring's plentiful supply of save points.\nRead more",

While the MSI GeForce RTX 3050 Gaming X 8G model I’ve tested has already ballooned to £380 / $450, this leaves it looking like much more of a  genuine alternative to RTX 3060, which is generally around £500 in the UK.

          "description": "The Ziggurat is an imposing presence in the lakeside hub town of Babylon’s Fall, its broad, horizon-spanning arches giving away nothing about the kind of fantastical beasts and secrets you’ll find inside. Based on the Tower Of Babel, the mythological birthplace of all the world’s languages, it’s perhaps ironic that Square Enix and PlatinumGames’ latest hack and slash started life with its own kind of miscommunication. When it was first unveiled at E3 2018, it looked like PlatinumGames were doubling down on all the good stuff they’d delivered just a year earlier with Nier: Automata, giving us another high-octane, single player action game with a dizzying array of weapons and over the top soundtrack, all wrapped up in an enticing layer of gothic high fantasy as players fight their way skyward. \nA long silence then followed, release dates slipped again and again, and its single follow-up trailer during one of Sony's 2019 State Of Play broadcasts remained as inscrutable as its iconic Ziggurat. It wasn’t until E3 2021 that the game’s true nature was finally revealed. Rather than being a solo adventure, Platinum and Square declared that not only would Babylon’s Fall be a primarily online multiplayer game, but that it was also going to be a live service game in the vein of Destiny and The Division. It was surprising, to say the least, but when I put the question to the PlatinumGames and Square Enix’s joint development team, Square Enix producer Junichi Ehara tells me that this was far from a sudden change of heart on their part: “From the very start of the project, it was decided that Babylon’s Fall would include the elements of high fantasy, hack-and-slash, and live service.” \nRead more",

Nail-biting combat, intricate worlds, a story that's drip-fed through it all. But it's the littlest bits that round off their identity. The dong of their menu sounds (I love a good menu noise) and their elevators operated by pressure plates.\nThere's also one other big thing that Soulsborne games deliver on. As any seasoned player knows, it's not a FromSoft game without the laughs. While there's plenty of humour in the cliff falls and silly invasions, I'm talking in a more literal sense. The NPCs often round off their sentences with a chuckle. But so far, Elden Ring lacks the despairing \"hahaha\" of old. And it makes me sad.\nRead more",

It's a \"playable short\" - basically a 30-minute tech demo designed for the Steam Deck, to show off how to use all the little flaps and controller bits on Valve's new handheld PCxGameboy toy (like the Aperture Hand Lab for VR from a few years back). Crucially, though, Aperture Desk Job is: a) free; 2) playable on a regular PC; and iii) set in the Portal universe.\nIn fact, it has surprisingly large implications for said game series (no spoilers in this post, btw).

This is a step I would 100% take; even as I write this in the office I am wrapped in a blanket I brought in from home, and my fingers are still cold.

They have a sentient tool box called Tin, but misadventure means all Vix's conventional tools are lost. In the course of a pretty meaty preview build I got to explore a strange, cuboid planet, top-down stylee, and repair things for a buncha robots. But there are loads of other aspects to FixFox - a preoccupation with food, a kind of space-sokoban game, a story that hints at mystery and evolution and time.

          "description": "Hello folks. I'm sorry this month's Letter From The Editor is a bit late. February sure has been one of those months, what with two of the biggest games of the year so far, not to mention a whole new piece of hardware launching in the space of two measly weeks. If I'd had my act together, I could have used this letter to give you a glimpse of all the exciting things we've just done - things like our freshly-concluded Souls Week, or all the neat Steam Next Fest bits we had planned, and (maybe) even a sneaky peek at all the excellent Steam Deck stuff we've written about as well. Alas, my time management skills have been a bit of a dumpster fire this month - although if you haven't checked out everything I've just mentioned, please do go and have a read. The RPS team have been very busy bees this month, and it would be a shame to miss out on all the great stuff going on.  \nOf course, the question now becomes, how do we carry on this kind of momentum when literally nothing has a confirmed release date past the end of March? The answer is... complicated.\nRead more",

Elden Ring is, of course, much better than sick at any temperature, obviously - I'm just saying that so far, I have not found it to be much easier or less opaque than any other FromSoft game, except it has clearer tooltips and sometimes an NPC will say, \"You should do this thing.\" In fact, the open world - the thing that people say is the most good bit - is having the opposite effect on me.\nRead more",

I immediately made a beeline for the concert venue and was treated to a rather unflattering rendering of Billy Idol and his guitar-playing chum performing a song. (Whiskey & Pills from his 2014 album, rather than anything you’re likely to have heard.) After the cutscene, you’re left in the empty amphitheatre, alone apart from a couple of guys talking about how great the concert was.\r\n\n\r\nThere is no context for this cameo. Billiam doesn’t feature as an NPC. In the 40-ish hours I spent playing the game, I had no reason to return to the amphitheatre. It makes no sense whatsoever and the only explanation I can come up with is that someone involved in the game really likes Billy Idol and just wanted him in their game. It’s the sort of random that I can respect, and I only wish the game had more.\r\n\n \nRead more",

This means jumping through hand-crafted levels, and generally shooting and slicing your way through the various demonic mobs and mini-bosses that spawn in front of you.

Babylon's Fall will let me carve up sad androids with the aid of my innards, and it looks fun.\nRead more",

And it certainly isn’t twee: from its no-nonsense, all-black design to the performance-tweaking options in its OS, the Deck is a serious device, even and especially when it’s serious about giving you a good time. That’s in spite of some imperfections, to be sure – the software, screen and battery life may disappoint anyone expecting another top-end Valve hardware masterclass to follow their Index virtual reality headset.

Exhibited most dramatically by Microsoft stumping up $69 billion for Activision Blizzard, this trend towards conglomerification has raised worries about both creative expression and the potential locking-down of more games to certain platforms.\nValve president and co-founder Gabe Newell is no stranger to making some additions. Valve famously hired the student developers of Narbacular Drop to work on what eventually became Portal, and acquired Firewatch developers Campo Santo in 2018. In our recent interview, I asked him whether he thought consolidation could be a problem for the industry going forwards.\nRead more",

I did not elaborate on how I wish there was a version that couldn't be undermined by boring, annoying Other People.\r\n\n\r\nBlood West isn't the same as Hunt, but they're definitely related. It also wears its love of Blood on its sleeve. It also also carries Thief DNA, and even takes some notes from Dark Souls, a game I dislike because it's bad and everyone is just wrong. Most remarkably though, Blood West feels almost entirely itself, rather than just an assembly of other things. It's really damn good.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I've been playing the Steam Next Fest demo of The Wandering Village, a city-builder that has you rustle up a community on the back of a roaming beast. It's called Onbu and it couldn't give a monkey's that you're on its back just trying to get by. At first, that is. Eventually you're able to strike up a bit of a relationship with the big lizard and build a sort of symbiotic relationship. Onbu stays on track, Onbu gets a treat. Good Onbu.\nI'm not usually one for strategy games where you've got to manage rocks and wood and allocate workers. Some of that comes down to their many systems frying my little brain, but Onbu has me persevering. Why? Because the resources I'm harvesting and community I'm building help or hinder Onbu. My enemy isn't some army a mile away, it's Onbu.\nRead more",

As the world watches this historical and terrifying event unfold, efforts have begun to aid civilians and organizations on the ground floor and those displaced, like the Ukrainian Red Cross.

          "description": "PlayStation has announced a State of Play presentation for tomorrow, March 9, at 2 p.m. PT/4 p.m. CT/ 5 p.m. ET with a special focus on games from its Japanese publishers. \nThis news comes by way of a new blog post released today that says this State of Play will run for roughly 20 minutes. It will highlight games from Japanese publishers, but PlayStation says it will have a few updates from other developers too. Here's the announcement from the PlayStation Blog:\nAs always, PlayStation will air the State of Play stream on both its YouTube and Twitch channels. As for what to expect, considering Sony is highlighting games from its Japanese publishers, the safest bet seems like PlayStation console-exclusive Final Fantasy XVI, which was first revealed during a Sony showcase like this, or even Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin, which will be released on March 15. \nAs for the \"few updates from other developers located around the world,\" God of War: Ragnarok seems like a lock considering it's supposed to release this year and we still haven't seen much of it, save for a few trailers. Of course, this is all just speculation. Fortunately, we don't have to wait long because this 20-minute State of Play is just a little over 24 hours away. \nWhat do you hope to see tomorrow? Let us know in the comments below!",

Reportedly, the showrunners of Amazon’s hit sci-fi show The Expanse, as well as The Wheel of Time, will helm the series alongside PlayStation Productions. Representatives from both Sony and Amazon Studios declined to comment on Deadline’s story.\nThere’s no word on what the show itself would entail or whether it’s based on the original Greek mythology series or the current Norse-themed games. Either would make sense given that PlayStation Productions exists to expand Sony’s first-party franchises into broader media, such as the recent Uncharted film and upcoming Ghost of Tsushima movie. \nIf true, it wouldn’t be the first video game live-action show on Amazon’s plate. It’s currently developing a Fallout show, recently casting Walton Goggins in an unknown role. Other video game adaptions hitting TV include HBO’s The Last of Us, which premieres next year, and Paramount+ subscribers can look forward to the upcoming Halo series. Paramount also recently announced a Sonic the Hedgehog movie spin-off starring Knuckles. \n[Source: Deadline via IGN]",

This week we're bidding farewell to Nathan Drake by discussing his final adventure in Uncharted 4: A Thief's End.\nReleased on May 10, 2016, Uncharted 4 was a shake-up for the series in more ways than one. Amy Henning, the franchises' primary creative mind, departed Naughty Dog during the game's development, leaving The Last of Us masterminds Neil Druckmann and Bruce Straley to revamp the game's production. Uncharted 4 introduced players to Nate's long-lost brother Sam Drake (who was originally conceived as a more villainous figure) as well as new mechanics such as a grapple hook and even dialogue choices. How did Naughty Dog tie a bow on this beloved franchise? Tune in to find out. \nJoin hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and Game Informer Features Editor Kim Wallace (@kstar1785) as we unpack the history, narrative, and impact of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. \nIf you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

We're officially in the thick of March, and while game releases are still coming in hot as they did all throughout February, something about this weekend feels like there's a tad of a respite.

Described by the team as a new “mini-raid” experience, these Sea Forts can be attacked and plundered at any time by yourself or a full crew.

Forts are meant to bring players together, whereas Rare says Sea Forts are meant to provide a personalized challenge to players. \nAnother new feature in Season 6 is the addition of more Pirate Legend Voyages. These are replayable legends that will task you with uncovering treasure by way of new maps, plundering ship graveyards, and more. On top of all this, Rare has released a 2022 timeline that details what to expect in not just Season 6, but Season 7, 8, and 9, which will take players through all of 2022. \nFor more about Sea of Thieves, read about Shrouded Islands, the game’s first adventure released last month, and then check out this story about how Sea of Thieves’ PvP arena is set to shut down this month.\nAre you excited for Season 6 of Sea of Thieves?

Games like Resogun and Nex Machina were homages to zany, psychedelic shoot 'em ups. Returnal, in its own impressive way, builds upon the developer's lineage by offering similar visuals and mechanics wrapped in a 3D, Triple-A skin. Despite the massive success of the sci-fi roguelike – Housemarque was acquired by Sony, after all – the studio is smartly broadening its horizons again. Housemarque is developing a new game, but it won't be Returnal 2. \nIn an award show interview with Venturebeat and an array of other outlets, narrative director Gregory Louden, game director Henry Krueger, and managing director Ilari Kuittinen were asked about the future of Housemarque (among other topics), \"...In a time where games are changing, the people playing them are changing, how do you hold on to [your] identity?\"\nRecently, Sony's pivoted towards a live service methodology, a multiplayer-centric style that Housemarque likely won't employ. That's because the team's already tried it, to middling results:\n\"We had our stint working on multiplayer games, because a few years back it seemed like you needed to have some kind of multiplayer experience. We tried that, and we really didn't do it as well. But it's early days with us starting a new game, a new IP, concepting it out. We'll see what comes with that.\"\nWhat exactly this new IP is remains to be seen, but Kuittinen also briefly mentioned that Nex Machina, \"a shoot-'em-up game in the style of the coin-ops from the 80s,\" might be a clue. It's safe to assume that Housemarque might be working on another large-scope game like Returnal, and it'll be interesting to see how the developer finds ways to mix its arcade roots with a modern, new-gen veneer. \nFor more on Returnal, read our review. \n[Source: Venturebeat]",
