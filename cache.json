And if you take licensed games out of the discussion, the number falls even more. Currently, outside of some notable titles like New Super Lucky’s Tale and Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury, there is a distinct lack of big-budget kid-friendly games. Kukoos: Lost Pets aims to fill that hole in the Switch’s library by creating not only a game designed primarily for a younger audience but one that can be enjoyed by the whole family together.\nUpon booting up Kukoos: Lost Pets, the first thing that jumped out at us is just how strong the game’s presentation is. In many ways, Kukoos: Lost Pets feels like an episode of a long-lost cartoon show. The overall aesthetics looks like a mix between Fall Guys and Super Monkey Ball, evoking the simple, memorable, and instantly recognizable art style. Character designs are wacky and exaggerated, the environment is full of vivid and cartoony colors, and the writing feels as though it was ripped straight from a Saturday morning cartoon.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It apparently occurs when an NPC walks directly through the Pokémon during the middle of the battle (as you do), with the majority of the body disappearing to leave the head floating through space.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

There have been two official trailers, a handful of posters, the release of the main theme, and that's not to mention the F.L.U.D.D.-scale leaks that we seem to come across every week. Now the film's marketing department is moving the promo campaign into a whole new dimension (see what we did there?) as Illumination's Mario has taken to the 3D billboard.\nThis should come as no surprise to us by now. In 2022, can you really deem a product 'officially released' if it hasn't had a 3D billboard campaign? We don't think so.

If there’s a problem with having such a distinctive creative voice, though, is that we've been trained by his previous games to expect the unexpected. And that's why Inscryption's arrival on Switch is such a treat: as the first of Mullins' games to hit the console, many Switch owners won’t have had the chance to play his earlier works. If you’re one of them, you’re in for a treat.\nThe Switch home screen icon for Inscryption is a 3.5-inch floppy disk. The game loads with a flickery CRT filter over the production logos and then frames the whole work as a dusty old computer game that hasn't been played in a long time. That game is a card game, played against a mysterious Dungeon Master-type figure. However, within minutes, it becomes apparent that your eerie foe isn't talking to you, the player of the computer game, but to an in-game avatar who is playing the card game inside the computer game. So before you’ve even sat comfortably, Inscryption has you playing a game within a game within a game.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Bulwark Studios' star hopping epic takes the operatic, elegiac grandeur of Relic's RTS classic, but replaces the space battles with a chewy mixture of stellar logistics.\nAlso like Homeworld, it's a darned stylish thing. The game commences with a spectacular intro cutscene wherein a futuristic space-shuttle launches from Earth, breaking through the atmosphere to dock with a gigantic, revolving space-station like a chromed hubcap off some petrolhead's pride & joy. The cutscene neatly transitions into the play-perspective, where you see that same shuttle slide into the docking bay from the cold void outside. Welcome to the Tiqqun, Administrator.

Since then, it has been continually developed by brothers Tarn and Zach Adams, who have added a truly wild amount of stuff over the last two decades.

On the one hand, the brand new additions - the new Tank, Ramattra, and the new Shambali Monastery map - are gorgeous, intriguing, and enjoyable.

It’s not that all the separate parts go badly together, having chocolate jazzies and cola bottles all jumbled in together is exactly what I want. The problem is that it can’t possibly live up to what you hoped for when you’re scooping treats into that weighty paper bag. There’s a surprise chalkiness in the chocolates, some of the gummies are glued together, and in your haste, you’ve nabbed two lookalike sweets and mismanaged your expectations. At a glance, it’s precisely the rainbow-coloured jumble you wanted, but often it just leaves a bad taste in your mouth.\nKynseed is an RPG, and a life sim, and a sandbox. It is also Cooking Mama, and Moonlighter, and a dungeon crawler. It is gentle vibes ASMR relax-and-watch-the-seasons-change, and also crass and knowingly subversive. It does some of these things excellently, while other parts just don’t hold up.\nRead more",

Normally, these exclusive supporter articles are reserved for our Premium subscription tier, but because we wanted to give those Standard introductory folks a taste of what Premium has to offer as well, we decided to make a bunch of them visible to all subscribers.  \nAbout a week into November, we realised that we didn't have a very good way of flagging which of those articles Standard subscribers could actually read (our bad), and due to a combination of holidays, illness and general busy-ness, we completely failed to come up with a solution. Apologies! To remedy that, I've now listed all of them below. Enjoy! \nRead more",

There are a lot of reasons that might happen, but I'll be honest: it's never a great sign. I'm usually pretty chillaxed about the occasional wonky animation or frame stuttering when a game runs, but in this case The Callisto Protocol runs so badly on PC that if it were my child and the coach wasn't putting it in to play football - even as a sub in the last five minutes, you know, just to give it a go, like - I'd be saying, \"Yeah, bench the sucker, I get it.\"\nThe stuttering and slowing down whenever anything moves is especially problematic in a horror game where your survival depends on quickly dodge-reacting to sudden threats. So I can't, right now, recommend you get The Callisto Protocol on PC. If Striking Distance get it running properly? Eh. Maybe.\nRead more",

I'm about halfway through its campaign at the moment, but the rhythm of calling up replacements and reinforcing my squads hasn't quite been engrained into my hotkey fingers yet. I keep making the mistake of thinking I can just push through with my remaining forces, but as any COH stalwart will know, that kind of road only ever leads to total disaster. \nImagine my surprise, then, when I came to preview the latest build of Company Of Heroes 3's dynamic, Total War-style Italian campaign and seemed to be, you know, actually making some pretty steady progress as I pushed up its mission maps. I was, admittedly, only playing the opening levels of this particular campaign, and I also had the aid of a handy M4A1 Sherman tank providing some welcome backup muscle. But during my four hours with it, I felt more in control of the battlefield than I've ever done while playing COH2. I was making excellent use of its reinforcement options, and heck, I was even remembering to tell units to retreat back to the nearest aid post so I didn’t lose the buffs they'd earned through their new EXP-driven promotions and veterancy bonuses. Then I played a mission from its more linear North African campaign, and had a very rude awakening indeed. Why, hello, frantic pressure and torrents of death bullets from Company Of Heroes 2 again, it's been a while.\nRead more",

But when I sat down with vice president of production David Littman to talk more about their WW2 RTS, I was curious where their focus would lie after launch. While many love Company Of Heroes for its top notch campaigns, Littman told me they \"still have over 400,000 players still playing COH 1 and 2 monthly\" via multiplayer, which is impressive considering the last game in the series came out nine years ago. And when it comes to COH 3, Littman says they'll go \"where the players are\".\nRead more",

          "description": "For the last ten years, the XCOM designers at Firaxis have traded in 'if's and 'maybe's. If this shot lands, then maybe I can pull off this carefully calculated plan I’m brewing. It's exactly the kind of taut, knife-edge tension we've come to love and expect from their turn-based strategy games, but Marvel's Midnight Suns takes a different approach. As the titular demon hunters join forces with some famous Avengers faces to take down the evil sorceress Lilith and Marvel mega villain Chthon, there's never any question about whether your moves will or won't work here. You're playing as the world's most powerful superheroes. Of course, they’re going to work. And forget about cowering behind knee-high cover walls, too, because if you're not already bulletproof, you've certainly got the reflexes and supercharged muscle mass to soak up anything Lilith’s Hydra minions are going to chuck at you.\r\n\nQuestion is, by tipping the power scales in your favour like this, do you risk destroying that delicate balance of risk and reward? At first glance, it's easy to think a more reliable set of heroes would end up dulling what made Firaxis' XCOM games so special, but the result is something equally thrilling. Given how the Marvel machine has drawn in and chewed up so much singular creative talent in the wider MCUniverse, Firaxis emerging with their cred intact is nothing short of extraordinary. Not only have they endured their radioactive spider bite, they've come out bigger and better for it, creating not only the best Marvel game I've played, but one of the best superhero games full stop.\nRead more",

Valve even took down one of its own games. Released in 2004 with Steam AppID 92, Codename: Gordon is a Flash-based 2D side-scroller set in the Half-Life universe, developed by Nuclearvision and published by Valve. It was removed due to a hard-coded link to the now-defunct developer’s domain, which Valve regarded as a security risk.\nBut removed isn’t always the same as gone, and exploring Steam’s deleted items is an adventure through modern gaming history.

Now that we're a few years clear of Slay The Spire's chokehold over the genre, deckbuilders are starting to come thick and fast in a variety of exciting mash-ups. This year alone, I've sunk a hefty number of hours into the deckbuilding tower defence 'em up ORX, got lost in the tabletop plots of Foretales, and later this week we'll see the launch of Marvel's Midnight Suns, the new card-based strategy RPG from XCOM makers Firaxis. It's a good time to be a fan of deckbuilders, is what I'm saying, and early next year the mythological exploits of Mahokenshi will be looking to carry the baton forward into 2023. \nMade by the Paris-based Game Source Studio, this turn-based strategy battler sees you take control of four types of samurai as you seek to bring balance to a mystical realm above the clouds. Oni, goblins and other creatures from Japanese myth are your primary antagonists here, but its hexagonal islands are also stuffed full of text-based narrative events, sidequests, and treasure troves to uncover. It's a lot to take in, but the latter in particular are vital to your success. That's because every time you start a new mission in Mahokenshi, you'll be going in with a completely fresh deck - and based on an early preview build I've been playing recently, it's both an ingenious way to keep things feeling fresh, but it can also be a double-edged sword when it comes to trying out new tactics.\nRead more",

          "description": "Having returned to World Of Warcraft after many, many years away from Azeroth in our new Inventory Space video series, I'm taken aback by how disjointed the new player experience has become. Blizzard have streamlined the early game, sure, but in doing so they've made it almost impossible to pin down my sense of place in the world. As Blizzard carves out new space for new regions and races with each and every expansion, I wonder: has the game become too big? Or put another way: am I unable to grasp just how vast its become?\nRead more",

Games based on the interstellar action of the movie tend to end up veering towards the strategy genre though, such as the recent Terran Command. Well, Offworld Industries have loaded up a dropship with Starship Troopers: Extermination and plonked the licence right where it belongs on Planet Co-op FPS. It’s targeting a 2023 release, and probably the head carapace of a very confused giant alien insectoid, too. You can watch a short teaser for the game below.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Jump into a world of color\nAs far as beautiful, artistic indies games go, Gris has to be up there as one of the greats. It's got an elegant, watercolor-esque art style, and what the gameplay lacks in hardcore, traditional mechanics it makes up for in emotionally resonant, albeit vague, storytelling vignettes -- just how I like it. To boot, the game actually has some nice platforming sections, which absolutely gave me trouble as someone who is horrible at platformers. Gris certainly isn't a game everyone will enjoy, but I do think it's a game everyone should at least try. If you haven't played it yet, now you won't have any excuse, because Gris is finally getting ported to the PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One on December 13.\nhttps://twitter.com/devolverdigital/status/1600173231360466945\nThe game follows the titular character Gris, a \"hopeful young girl lost in her own world, dealing with a painful experience in her life. Her journey through sorrow is manifested in her dress, which grants new abilities to better navigate her faded reality.\" The Steam description also bills Gris as a game \"free of danger, frustration or death,\" which is true in terms of it not having a fail state, but I have to admit that the aforementioned platforming sections did frustrate me a bit. That's more of a me problem, though.\nGris ended up winning a ton of well-deserved awards back in 2019 after its release, including Best Visual Art at the Game Developers Choice Awards and Games for Impact at the Game Awards. It's a short game, too, so you could finish it in an afternoon if you wanted to. Personally, I played on the Switch, and it made for a great lazing-on-the-couch-during-a-rainy-day game. I'll have no problems at all running on the most recent gen consoles, and I'll be interested to see if they use the DualSense to add some extra haptics to enhance the experience.\nThe post Gris is coming to PlayStation and Xbox this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

Still, if you're a Nintendo Switch owner and need a little bit of schoolgal sluggin' to tide you over, then you're in luck, as WayForward's cartoonish brawler is now available to play for \"free\" as part of the Nintendo Switch Online Game Trial service.\nFrom today until December 12, all Nintendo Switch Online subscribers can download and play the 2019 scrapper in its entirety, guiding Kyoko and Misako through the avenues and alleyways of River City on a mission to discover the truth behind the disappearance of boyfriends Kunio and Riki. Should you decide to bag the full game for yourself, then RCG is currently available on the eShop for a discounted price for the duration of the trial.\nAs for River City Girls 2, well, Japan already has the long-awaited sequel, though seemingly not in its complete and fully featured form. WayForward announced earlier today that the western release will be blessing us on December 15. That's next week! So while the fist-throwing sequel might be hitting these shores a little later than expected, at least we can expect to receive the title as nature intended — complete with its roster of cool characters and its wild 'n' chaotic four-player mode.\nRiver City Girls 2 launches December 15 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch. Be sure to check out our previous write-ups on both River City Girls and River City Girls Zero, as well as our interviews with director Adam Tierney, and awesome composer Megan McDuffee.\nThe post River City Girls now available on Nintendo Switch Online Game Trials appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Layoffs will happen at the studio as well\nMobile augmented reality (AR) game The Witcher: Monster Slayer is closing its doors next year. Developer Spokko is shutting down, with services fully ending next June.\nThe studio plans to gradually shutter its services over the coming months, as detailed in a new FAQ. The Witcher: Monster Slayer will first be taken down from the Google Play and Apple App Store on January 31, 2023, and all in-game purchases will be turned off at this time too.\nSpokko also plans no more new content after the 31st as well. Players will still be able to play and exchange in-game currencies for items up until Monster Slayer's closure. Then, on June 30, 2023, the servers will be shut down.\nThe team also made a statement, thanking fans for sharing in the Monster Slayer journey.\n\"We are proud that we were able to create a location-based AR experience that captured what it was like to be a witcher in real life and gave the community a chance to battle Witcher-world monsters up close and in person,\" the statement reads. \"This is what made The Witcher: Monster Slayer such a unique experience in The Witcher franchise.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhtWqIFydfo\nSomething ends, something begins\nAccording to Spokko's statement, Monster Slayer did not reach its business expectations. Spokko will be rolled into CD Projekt Red, with part of its staff given the chance to join core CD Projket Red projects. However, there will be some staff let go.\nWhile Monster Slayer was a bit strange, as a Pokemon GO approach to the world of The Witcher, it's still a shame to see the project's closure result in departures. CD Projekt seems to be broadly shifting its focus towards other areas, resulting in the winding down of several of its spinoff titles.\nThe post The Witcher: Monster Slayer is shutting down next June appeared first on Destructoid.",

Newcomers Marian (of Double Dragon fame) and Provie (from River City Ransom: Underground) also join the cast, rounding it out to six playable characters. And they'll need all that extra help to take on the Sanwakai syndicate that's turning River City upside down.\nRiver City Girls 2 has already launched in Japan and Asia, but the western version saw a bit of a delay. Thankfully, it hasn't taken too long for the brawler to get a launch date here.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIlPRmaIJL8\nHeading on down to River City\nIn River City Girls 2, players can take on up to four-player co-op with more characters, moves, enemies, and a larger world to explore. A big appeal of River City Girls 2 is online play. While the original River City Girls only had co-op in local play, the sequel will let players brawl through the levels together over the internet. That will doubtless make those hang-outs a little easier to organize.\nWayForward is also teasing a nonlinear world and more RPG-like character growth for the brawlers. All that, alongside some serious vocal talent and a new OST from Megan McDuffee, seems like a major draw for River City Girls 2.\nMe?

The Steam page is live now, with a host of info on what's to come in the Legacy of the Moonspell next week.\n\nWhat's in store for the Survivors? Well, the Legacy takes the action to a new map in the eastern lands, known as Mt. Moonspell. This locale is developer poncle's biggest stage yet, featuring several different environments include snowy mountains, a yokai-infested village, and yes, an abandoned castle.\nEight new characters join the fray, with four getting shown off today. 13 new weapons are also i nstore, including a set of season-shifting orbs and an ancestral force unleashed by a staff. Seems like a good way to blast a bunch of enemies away for experience.\nAdditionally, there are some hidden mysteries and more in store. Between the characters and weapons that poncle isn't revealing yet, it seems like there is a fair bit to discover in this new drop.\nI will survive\nIt seems like just yesterday that Vampire Survivors was a surprise hit trending up Steam's charts.

As of 2024, no further cards will be produced for the digital tabletop title, with a total of three expansions planned before the deck closes for good.\n\"We are not planning to release new cards starting from 2024, so the cards which will release in 2023 basically will be the last brand-new ones that we will be adding to the game,\" revealed Gwent director Vladimir Tortsov in a developer video. \"It's a pretty significant change, there's no way around it.\n\n\"With the cards that we are planning to add to the game next year, we are basically planning to close the card pool with every idea that we wanted to add, every mechanic that we wanted to see, pretty much everything that we would like to see in Gwent, we will try to fit it within the year.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EsTFtuDT2k\nThis does not, however, mean that Gwent will become a dead, non-playable entity. In a motion known to the studio as \"Gwenfinity\", a skeleton crew will be assigned to routinely keep one eye on the game's infrastructure, while the players themselves will be offered the opportunity to decide upon rule changes and balance tweaks as the Gwent meta continues, post-support.\nWith this new system, CDPR hopes that the Gwent community will be able to continue enjoying, and even evolving, the fantasy tabletop title. And so, while support will officially end in 2024, there will hopefully still be many, many years of coin-tossing over tavern tables still to come.\nThe post Witcher card game Gwent to wind down support in 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Quick update on some changes coming to Season 2,\" wrote OW2 director Aaron Miller on Twitter. \"After reviewing data for Season 1, we're moving Ramattra [to] Tier 45 of the Battle Pass and making a few more weekly challenges easier to complete. Excited for you all to see everything new in Season 2 starting tomorrow!\"\nhttps://twitter.com/aaronkellerOW/status/1599834286546644992?s=20&t=FunV3K50ZmLJkCJKMAE0Ww\nOriginally, Overwatch heroes were simply added to all players' rosters as they were released. But with the arrival of Overwatch 2 and its free-to-play structure, the new heroes now reside within the debuting, (and hugely divisive), battle pass system. By moving the new heroes to Tier 45, it is hoped that players will unlock the characters faster, though it is, admittedly, still a pretty meaty grind to get there.\nThe addition of the battle pass mechanic has been met with much grumbling from the Overwatch faithful. A common complaint, (echoed by this writer), is that it is simply a dull and excitement-free way to unlock goodies, and pales in comparison to the box of goodies players would receive for popping a new level. Of course, loot boxes come with their own highly negative ramifications, but, personally, I'll take the loot box animation and fistful of varied treats over grinding through endless drab avatar images... while paying for the privilege.\nOverwatch 2 season 2 kicks off today on all platforms.

According to Striking Distance Studios founder Glen Schofield, the frustrating stutter issue was an oversight, caused by the wrong coding to be patched at the final hour. It is hoped that this new update will improve general stability for all PC players moving forward.\nhttps://twitter.com/CallistoTheGame/status/1599508890168983552?s=20&t=X2gpZEs3trieLmkVxiNy1w\nYesterday, console players received a patch of their own, which looks to combat frame rate drops and random crashing on the PlayStation and Xbox editions of the survival horror adventure. Additionally, Striking Distance developers noted that they were aware of some problems caused by the visual-heavy title's ray-tracing effects. Further investigation is being made into the overall performance of The Callisto Protocol on all platforms, with further fixes and patches coming in the near future.\n\"We hear you,\" said Schofield in a new message posted Sunday. \"As we say in the [patch update] tweet, we will communicate and keep you all updated. We want you to play the game as intended.\"\nThe Callisto Protocol is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post The Callisto Protocol rolls out initial patches for PC and console appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "From Funkotron to Hollywood\nIn a pretty surprising announcement that I don't think anybody saw coming, Amazon Studios has announced that it has begun pre-production on a new feature film adaptation of the classic Sega Mega Drive adventure ToeJam & Earl — The new movie was announced yesterday in The Hollywood Reporter.\nThe new film is being produced by Unanimous Media — the studio founded by Stephen Curry — with a screenplay penned by Amos Vernon and Nunzio Randazzo, who have worked on the Hotel Transylvania franchise, as well as the upcoming Disney+ series, Superfudge. The movie will be co-produced by Story Kitchen, headed up by John Wick scribe Derek Kolstad and Sonic the Hedgehog producer Dmitri Johnson.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQlK-jTIiwU\nToeJam & Earl, created by Mark Voorsanger and Greg Johnson, hit the 16-bit market in 1991 and concerns the esoteric adventures of two hep-cat space aliens, who become marooned on Earth after their spaceship crashlands on our horrible little planet. From there, the two tripped-out protagonists must gather together the remnants of their ship, while avoiding delightfully satirical characters that symbolize the bizarre nature of human life.\nSomething of a cult classic, ToeJam & Earl would be followed by two sequels: 1993's Panic of Funkotron and 2002's Mission to Earth. More recently, 2019 saw the release of crowdfunded title Back in the Groove, which returned the franchise to its split-screen, 3/4 perspective mechanics. While TJ & E have been a part of gaming for many decades, the franchise is tightly held, with most of the games merely \"good\" at best. As such it seems an odd choice for a modern movie adaptation. However, the colorful universe and way-out characters and situations should make for some pretty twisted entertainment.\nThe untitled ToeJam & Earl movie is currently in pre-production at Amazon Studios.\nThe post ToeJam & Earl movie in the works at Amazon Studios appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "And I say give it to him\nDavid Harbour is one of my favorite actors right now. He was one of my favorite characters in Stranger Things, and after seeing him in his new Christmas-y comedy action flick Violent Night this past weekend, he cemented his place as one of my favorite actors working today, period. He can do it all -- drama, comedy, and most importantly, the surrogate father trope that been so hot in games the past console generation. Based on his serious nerd cred alone, I'm surprised Harbour's only games credit will be an upcoming horror game along with Jodie Comer, star of the spy thriller series Killing Eve.\nThere's a chance that all might change, however, because in an interview with Video Games FN, David Harbour shared another game series he dreams of working on: God of War. “I really like what those guys in the God of War universe are doing with my buddy Richard Schiff as Odin,\" he said. \"They sort of mess around with that genre too, and they're always surprising in terms of these gods and they wind up becoming--Thor is a big old jerk and Odin being this kind of older intellectual. I'd be interested in possibly doing some of that.”\n\nWell Mr. Harbour, we would also be interested in you doing some of that. After a series of action-packed roles, he's proved he'd be a perfect fit in both stature and demeanor. Now I'm not advocating for any form on nepotism, but if Richard Schiff is already a friend on the inside, he might be able to get Harbour an audition, at the very least, for any new roles that might arise in the next God of War game.\nSeeing as God of War Ragnarok just came out a few weeks ago, we don't have so much as an announcement that another GoW game is in the works, but I'd bet my money plans have already been lined up for some time now. Now if they can only get David Harbour involved, I might finally be persuaded to give the series a second try...\nThe post Stranger Things’ David Harbour wants a role in the next God of War game appeared first on Destructoid.",

All across my Twitter timeline, I've come across the same old takes, from people lamenting the biggest snubs of the year to people furiously debating the Game of the Year while conveniently ignoring 2/3 of the nominees. At the heart of it all, though, I see the truth: nobody really cares about this stuff.\nThe Game Awards are not prestigious. Nobody actually cares about the winner of any category for more than an hour after the ceremony airs.

Photo mode arrives in God of War Ragnarok today, as part of a major update to the title.\nThe v3.00 update adds photo mode, which was confirmed to be a post-launch addition ahead of Ragnarok's release. Today's update adds the option to open photo mode by pressing the Square button while inside the options menu.\nThe Sony Santa Monica team runs down the options in a new PlayStation blog, showing how God of War Ragnarok's photo mode will allow for captures in most places. Whether it's overlooking a beautiful vista or in the middle of absolutely annihilating an ancient creature of myth, there is time to snap some pictures.\nFeatures include expressions for main characters in various different scenes. I won't list them out here in case you're still playing, as some are a bit of a surprise. But you will have some expression control over chunks of God of War Ragnarok's core cast.\nThere are also standard options like hiding characters, adjusting field of view or focal length, shutter controls, and filters with controls for fine adjustments.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1wr0DfV73E\nTake a picture\nPhoto modes have become a prominent feature in games over the last generation or so, as consoles have made saving and uploading in-game screenshots easy. For big Sony games, they've often been pretty solid offerings too.\nGod of War Ragnarok is, from what I've seen, a gorgeous game with a variety of locales to explore. Basically, it seems like good fodder for photo-snapping. And if you've already bought and beat it, now you've got an excuse to trek back over the Nine Realms all over again. The update is live today for all God of War Ragnarok owners.\nThe post God of War Ragnarok gets photo mode in update today appeared first on Destructoid.",

The music was fun, the visuals were beautiful, and it turned out to have some of the best-character focused writing I've seen in games in a long time. We Are OFK turned out to be more of an interactive mini series than a game, but if you're into that sort of thing like I am, it's definitely one to check out.\nNow we just got our first update from the team behind We Are OFK since the game came out back in August, and it's kind of a free DLC, of sorts. The band is releasing a holiday song in collaboration with Sony Music Soundtracks -- their own cover of the seasonal classic \"It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year\" -- which will be accompanied by an interactive music video like the ones from the base game. I love a good holiday single/album from musical artists I love, so it's fun to see OFK getting in on the action. The free update will be available for all players on this Friday, December 9.\nhttps://twitter.com/OFKband/status/1598799498524098561\nThe next tweet in the thread following the announcement also says that OFK \"got offered some special secret collabs.\" I have no idea if this is in regards to their music, games, or both, but it sounds like exciting news based on the emojis in said tweet. Based on the Steam reviews for We Are OFK, it looks like I wasn't the only one who thoroughly enjoyed the game, so I'm looking forward to seeing what the team continues to put out in the future. And of course, I'd love to see other artists and game designers follow suit, because the industry needs more chill interactive narrative experiences.\nThe post We Are OFK is releasing a new holiday-themed song/interactive music video appeared first on Destructoid.",

An early Steam page listing seems to point towards a launch date for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, just ahead of this week's Game Awards.\nUsers spotted earlier today that the Steam store page for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor had been updated with a bunch of information, including a launch date of March 16, 2023. The page was noticed, shared around the internet, and quickly scrubbed, but not before it was read and catalogued by several sites (thanks, Gematsu).\nThe info arrives ahead of The Game Awards 2022, which airs this Thursday, December 8. Respawn and awards showrunner Geoff Keighley have confirmed that Survivor will be showing off its first gameplay at the show.\nhttps://twitter.com/starwars/status/1599813247573655553\nPeering into the future\nWhile Electronic Arts and Respawn haven't confirmed anything yet, it does look like we're getting a look at Survivor either way. The new game is a follow-up to 2019's Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, which followed rogue Jedi Cal Kestis as he fled the Empire and mastered his powers.\nMeanwhile the sequel Jedi: Survivor picks up five years after Fallen Order. It looks like Cal is still dealing with a universe hostile to the Jedi. But we haven't learned too much on what the years mean, or where the conflict has gone, since the conclusion of the first game.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HLDaBGdnLc\nIf the Steam page info pans out to be accurate, it looks like Cal might be picking up a blaster alongside his trusty lightsaber. Obi-Wan might deem that to be a bit uncivilized, but Cal's going through some stuff, so I think we can let it slide.\nWe'll find out more info at The Game Awards 2022 on Thursday, December 8.\nThe post Star Wars Jedi: Survivor leak springs ahead of The Game Awards appeared first on Destructoid.",

Following a presentation that did not, in fact, reveal Tekken 8 at all, the hosts were instructed to basically \"go crazy\" as if they had just seen a major reveal — leaving viewers scratching in their heads as to what was so dang exciting. The situation was cleared up at the Sony State of Play presentation in September, where Bandai Namco officially announced the sequel along with an impressive first trailer.\nhttps://twitter.com/TEKKEN/status/1598739581381349394?s=20&t=arkfL9EHBOU4UWpdS71Y7g\n \nTekken 8, the latest entry in a franchise dating right back to PlayStation's launch days, will utilize the power of Unreal Engine 5, presenting character models and effects unlike those seen in the series to date. Bandai Namco has already noted that the new fighter is being built for PC and current-gen platforms PS5 and Xbox Series X only, suggesting that some pretty hefty hardware will be required for those running local tournaments. Onnly two characters have been officially revealed to date, Kazuya Mishima and Jin Kazama, but we can probably expect more combatants to be revealed this Thursday.\nTekken 8 is in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.

The tag on a new major Xbox game in 2023 will be going from $60 up to $70.\nIGN broke the news that Microsoft's major, built-for-Xbox Series games are seeing a tick up to $69.99 USD. Regional pricing may differ, though specifics have not been outlined yet.\nA spokesperson told IGN that the price reflect \"the content, scale and technical complexity\" of the games. Titles seeing the bump will still be available on launch with Xbox Game Pass.\nThis $70 price point will apply to some of the Xbox heavy-hitters for the new year, including Forza Motorsport, Redfall, and Starfield.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmb2FJGvnAw\nThe price of the game\nXbox head Phil Spencer said in October that he did think the company would, at some point, have to raise prices \"on certain things.\" The price point was going to stick headed into the holidays, but once we're into 2023, that will see the tag finally shift.\nIt's a bump that several other companies have already made, too. PlayStation has hiked its prices up to $70 for its blockbuster first-party games, and publishers like Ubisoft have made similar moves. Others, like Capcom, haven't made the shift.\nThis comes amid a move to hike the price of hardware, too. Sony has also increased the price of the PlayStation 5 in select regions. And on the VR side of things, the Meta Quest 2 saw a price hike earlier this year.\nMicrosoft declined to comment to IGN about any potential console price increases.\nFrequently, the rising cost of development has been cited as a factor in price increases. But as those initial tags go up, it certainly does make Xbox Game Pass seem like a good offer.\nThe post Microsoft is raising the price of major first-party Xbox games to $70 in 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

And while players are already getting to grips with newer heroes such as Junker Queen, Soujourn, and the powerful healer Kiriko, developer Activision Blizzard is already prepping the way for the first character of Season 2, the powerful Omnic monk, Ramattra.\nA Tank class character, Ramattra seems immediately comparable with OG OW hero Zenyatta, both characters being spiritual beings of Omnic build. Quite unlike Zenyatta, however, Ramattra has a far more aggressive nature — having initially been built as a war machine during the Omnic Crisis. As a Ravager model, Ramattra only knew violence and combat — laying waste to his enemies during the extended b…",

That's a problem. Sometimes, when a classic is too classical, it can become a bit of a headache. Revisiting a really beloved game can become a chore when you've seen its best ideas executed better by games that came later.\nNot so with Metroid. Nearly every 2D Metroid game is still a very good time, even when placed next to the wave of wonderful indie Metroidvanias we've seen recently. Unfortunately, \"nearly\" is the operative word in that sentence. There are definitely downright bad 2D Metroid games, just as there are great ones. So allow me to walk you through every 2D Metroid game, from the clunky…",

Project L, the League of Legends fighting game in development at Riot Games, got a new gameplay deep-dive today, showing off its tag system and battles in even more detail.\nFirst revealed in 2019, the still-codenamed Project L looks to take the brawls of Runeterra and bring them into the 2D fighting arena. Today, executive producer Tom Cannon and game director Shaun Rivera talked a little bit about the actual systems at work in Project L.\nWhile the project started out as a one-on-one fighter, according to Rivera, the team swapped to a tag system about two years ago.

          "description": "Microsoft has announced that it’s raising the price of first-party Xbox Series X/S games to $70 beginning in 2023. \nIGN first confirmed the news, with a Microsoft spokesperson telling the outlet that \"This price reflects the content, scale, and technical complexity of these titles.\" First-party Xbox Series X/S games such as Starfield, Redfall, and Forza Motorsport will be among the first titles to have the $70 price tag when they arrive next year. The price of Xbox Game Pass appears unaffected, and the Microsoft spokesperson continued by saying, “As with all games developed by our teams at Xbox, they will also be available with Game Pass the same day they launch.” \nGiven the increasingly exorbitant cost of triple-A game development, the price rise was only a matter of time. In an October live interview with The Wall Street Journal, Microsoft head Phil Spencer said as much when he stated that the company couldn’t keep its products at the same price forever. \"I do think at some point we'll have to raise the prices on certain things, but going into this holiday we thought it was important to maintain the prices.\" \nSony was the first console maker to charge $70 for its PlayStation 5 first-party offerings at the start of this generation. In August, Sony raised the price of the PS5 itself in multiple international territories, citing inflation as the primary reason; Microsoft immediately responded by saying it had “no plans to raise the price of the Xbox Series X/S consoles.” Of course, that statement was made before Spencer’s comments to the WSJ, and Microsoft declined to comment when IGN asked about the potential of a hardware price raise.\nAs a reminder, the $70 tag only applies to current-gen titles. PS4 and Xbox One games have and will remain $60, the former standard established during the PS3/Xbox 360 generation. \n[Source: IGN]\nWhat do you think of Microsoft adopting the $70 price?

These cuddly though often dangerous critters include the seemingly love-obsessed Lovander, grass panda Mossanda, and Tanzee, which is basically Grookey if it possessed a love for the AK-47. Sure, some of them boldly walk the line of being outright copies of existing Pokémon, but these can carry guns, which we imagine is enough of a separation to repel any lawyers. Check out the latest trailer below. \n\n\nPalworld first gained attention in June 2021. Developer Pocketpair bills the experience as a multiplayer open-world survival game as opposed to a turn-based RPG like Pokémon. As a human character, you can capture, befriend, train, battle, and breed Pal. If you consider yourself a bigger monster than what you're catching, you even sell, eat, and outright exploit Pal for labor. On top of that, you can build houses, battle poachers, and construct factories to put your critters to work. Palworld looks nuts, and we're still not entirely convinced it's a real video game, but we certainly want it to be. \nThankfully, Pocketpair plans to release Palworld in Steam Early Access sometime next year, so we'll hopefully get a chance to try it out sooner than later. The game is currently slated for PC.",

Today, the upcoming action game made its first peep since its last showing in 2021, showing off its frenetic combat and stylish flair. \nLost Soul Aside began life as a solo project by developer Yang Bing. Its 2016 proof-of-concept trailer impressed many with its triple-A caliber presentation and Devil May Cry-inspired action, including Sony, who scooped up the project as a third-party PS4 exclusive. Bing is now working with a full team, Ultizero Games. Sony announced last year that Lost Soul Aside will come to PS5 as well. The adventure stars protagonist Kazar and his shapeshifting dragon companion, who transforms into various weapons for Kazar to wield. \n\n\nDespite being officially announced for years, today’s video is billed as an “announcement trailer” presumably reintroducing the game to newcomers while reminding everyone else that it still, in fact, exists. The gameplay looks as polished as it ever has, though sadly, we still have no idea when we’ll get to play it. \nLost Soul Aside will be available on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.

          "description": "Fortnite Chapter 3 has officially come to a close. \nChapter 3 began last December and now, we officially know Chapter 4 begins tomorrow, December 4. Like with previous chapter launches, Chapter 4 brings with it an all-new map to play on that will be filled with new locations and returning favorites. There's a glimpse of this new map at the end of the Chapter 4 \"A New Beginning\" trailer, which you can watch below: \n\n\nHere's another look at the Chapter 4 map: \nElsewhere in the trailer, you can catch a glimpse of new skins that will likely be in the Season 1 battle pass such as Geralt of Rivia from The Witcher series, the Incredible Hulk, the Doom Slayer from Doom, and even YouTuber Mr. Beast. \nBefore all of that, though, players got the chance to experience the Chapter 3 \"Fracture\" finale event today at 4 p.m. ET (if you missed it, unfortunately you cannot go back to play it as of now). In it, we saw the battle island essentially implode with bits and pieces of it scattered across the stars. \nPlayers were tasked with collecting zero point fragments scattered about a small section of this map floating in space. The more players collected, the more pieces were added to the playable area. Players could complete quests such as throwing snowballs at enemies or bouncing players off into space as beach balls. You could also complete races, match island props, and more. Everything you did rewarded you with a zero point fragment. After about 30 to 40 minutes of this, the Chapter 4 trailer began. In it, we saw what appeared to be the creation of the Chapter 4 map, with the zero point dragging in pieces from space to create it. \n\nFortnite Chapter 4 officially begins tomorrow, December 4, but a start time has not yet been revealed. \nDid you participate in the Chapter 3 finale? What did you think of it?

          "description": "HBO has released a new trailer for The Last of Us, its upcoming TV series based on the hit Naughty Dog game of the same name. And it looks awesome (and sad...very, very sad). \nThe show's first bit of footage was released back in August and slowly, HBO has been revealing more and more about The Last of Us. We've seen Pedro Pascal's Joel and Bella Ramsey's Ellie in previous footage, but today's trailer gives us our longest look yet at the duo. Both continue to embody the spirit of Joel and Ellie in the games well and you can watch new footage of their scenes in the newest trailer below: \n\n\nAs you can see, the trailer features a lot more of Joel and Ellie, but it also gives us new looks at clickers, a bloater, and possibly even David (although it could be someone else, like one of David's henchmen). We also see Bill and Frank, and this trailer seems to tease that we'll be getting a lot more of their relationship in the show than we did in the game. In a blink-and-you'll-miss-it couple of moments, we even see Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson, who voiced Joel and Ellie in the games (shout-out to SlashFilm for catching that):\n#TheLastOfUs voice actors Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson appear in the new trailer for the HBO series. pic.twitter.com/z2oY51PFei\nDecember 3, 2022\nThe Last of Us premieres on HBO Max on January 15. \nFor more, check out this teaser trailer from September.\nWhat do you think of today's trailer?

In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch each Friday at 2 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. \nIn 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.\n\n\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

Various glitches, bugs, and frame rate drops are present throughout a lot of the game, something we noted in our review, and fans have been vocal about their dissatisfaction with this aspect of their Paldean journeys. It seems Nintendo is taking these frustrations to heart in a rare admission in the latest update for the game. \nThe company tweeted last night that a new software update of Scarlet and Violet was going live today alongside the following: \"We take the feedback from players seriously, and will continue to work on improvements to the games.\" \n\n\nNintendo further addresses these issues in the actual patch notes for the update too…",

However, this spinoff never made its way to the West so when Ishin hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in February, it will be the first time a lot of players will be able to play this game. To get prepared, RGG Studios has released a brand new trailer detailing some of the combat and associated mechanics present in the game. \nCheck out the Like A Dragon: Ishin combat trailer for yourself below: \n\n\n\"In 1860s Kyo, a solemn samurai's fight for justice stands to change the course of Japan's history forever,\" a press release reads. \"Draw your blade and join the revolution in this heated historical adventure.\" \nPlayers who preorder the Digital Deluxe Edition of Like A Dragon: Ishin will receive early access to the game starting February 17 (the standard release date is February 21) and the following in-game items: \nShinsengumi Captain's Set\nRoom Growth Support Kit\nSword Upgrade Materials Kit\nGun Upgrade Materials Kit\nThird Division Armament Expansion Kit\nThe Dragon of Dogma Skin\nAn additional three weapons: \n\t\nKijinmaru Kunishige, a dark sword with a white hilt\nBloody Sheen, a sword soaked in blood\nBlack Ship Cannon, a cannon taken from Western Ships\n\nFor more about the game, watch the Like a Dragon: Ishin reveal trailer and then watch this five-minute trailer released back in September. Be sure to read our list of upcoming remakes, which includes Ishin, after that. \nLike A Dragon: Ishin hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on February 21, 2023. \nAre you excited to check out Like A Dragon: Ishin next year?

As for what's available, Capcom lists ranked matches, casual matches, battle hub matches, open tournaments, extreme battle, the game center, and Street Fighter 6's training mode. \n\n\nIf you'd like to sign up to potentially participate in this second closed beta, you can do so here. It's important to note, though, that completing Capcom's application process does not guarantee you selection for the beta. Selection is handled via a lottery system, according to Capcom, and not a first-come, first-served basis. You'll need to have a registered Capcom ID to even apply and it must be linked to your platform account so be sure to do that first thing. Other than that, good luck getting in! The response to the first closed beta for Street Fighter 6 a few weeks ago was quite positive so it sounds like this second beta is going to be a great time as well. \nIn the meantime, be sure to check out Game Informer's Street Fighter 6 cover hub for all kinds of exclusive information and videos about the game. Here's a taste of what you can find there: \nStreet Fighter 6: Exclusive First Look At New Dynamic Control Scheme Meant To Help Button Mashers\nStreet Fighter 6: A Deep Dive Into Ken's New Look\nStreet Fighter 6: 118 Rapid-Fire Questions With Takayuki Nakayama & Shuhei Matsumoto\nMaking Kimberly's Street Fighter 6 Theme – Inside The Capcom Music Studio\nStreet Fighter 6 Art Director Breaks Down Each Revealed Character Design\nWatch These High-Skill Street Fighter 6 Developer Matches\nAre you applying to be in this second closed beta?

          "description": "Narrative dinosaur adventure Goodbye Volcano High has awakened from dormancy with a new gameplay trailer and a 2023 release window. The title, unveiled in June 2020 as one of the first PlayStation 5 titles, will now arrive sometime next summer.\nGoodbye Volcano High is a choice-driven teenage coming-of-age story starring Fang, a high school student, aspiring musician, and if you didn’t notice, a pterosaur. Alongside their bandmate Trish and other friends, the dino teens are faced with making the most of their final days together. Developer KO-OP describes the narrative as a tale of “personal growth, acceptance, and the power of community.” A new teaser trailer provides the first look at gameplay, showing off the dialogue interface and rhythm mechanics. \n\n\nKO-OP initially planned to release Goodbye Volcano High in 2021. However, last August, the small team pushed the launch into 2022 due to COVID-related development challenges and the decision to reboot the game’s narrative. The game still didn’t make a peep throughout 2022, and KO-OP says this latest delay stems from continued challenges related to the pandemic and the game’s large scope relative to the team’s size. For example, KO-OP states that over 6,000 voice lines have been recorded on top of completing a significant amount of “bespoke” animations. \nGoodbye Volcano High is slated to launch on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC via Steam.",

This update is already live on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 and is expected to begin rolling out to other platforms very soon. \n\n\nOther fixes in the 1.10 patch include fixing the Chaos Island map to display properly after clearing the island, fixing crashing bugs and audio issues, adding UI improvements, optimizing stability and performance, and more, according to Update Crazy, as noted by VGC. \nWhile waiting for the patch to download, read Game Informer's Sonic Frontiers review and then check out our top 10 tips to help you build momentum in the game. \n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]\nHave you been playing Sonic Frontiers?

          "description": "Warner Bros. Discovery revealed last month that it had hired Peter Safran and Marvel Studios alum and director James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy, The Suicide Squad, Peacemaker) to lead as co-CEOs of DC Studios, as reported by Variety. Since then, Gunn has been fielding questions about DC Studios, the DCU's future, and what his plans are as a new lead within DC's entertainment output. \nWhen asked on Twitter yesterday if he and Safran are \"planning to give more DC characters TV shows that'll add to the story for the DCEU,\" Gunn responded, \"Yes, most definitely, the DCU will be connected across film and TV (and animation).\" In a follow-up tweet, another user asked is there are plans to connect games to this larger DCU canon as well, to which Gunn simply responded, \"Yes.\" \nYes.\nNovember 27, 2022\nIt's an interesting response and idea, especially given that it seems clear Warner Bros. Discovery wants its DCU to become something more akin to Marvel Studios' MCU. However, MCU plans don't include video games because Marvel's video game efforts through partners such as Insomniac Games (Marvel's Spider-Man), Crystal Dynamics (Marvel's Avengers), and others do not connect in any way.\nIn fact, Marvel Games vice president and creative director Bill Roseman said back in September that it's important that each studios' Marvel game is not connected to the rest as it allows for narrative freedom said studio might not get otherwise.\nThis is one area DC could differ greatly from Marvel and who knows, perhaps it's the creative edge DC needs to catch up to the MCU. Only time will tell. \nIn the meantime, check out our thoughts on the latest DC game in Game Informer's Gotham Knights review. Read our list of the top 10 superhero games of all time after that. \nDo you like the idea of games connecting to the DCU or do you prefer Marvel's approach to video games?

          "description": "I’ve been excited about developer Flying Wild Hog’s Evil West since its reveal at The Game Awards in 2020. So much about it immediately captured my attention. Despite Red Dead Redemption’s best efforts, I’ve always felt there’s a shortage of wild wests in video games, although some games use a western’s formula to tell a story set elsewhere. Evil West’s premise also feels reminiscent of something you’d see in the PlayStation 2 era: cowboys who protect mere mortals from the secret horrors of the world, such as vampires and other creatures. My mind can’t help but see Darkwatch, a game I played repeatedly as a child, when I see Evil West. \nEven more generally, that era was great for third-person action westerns – Gun, Red Dead Revolver, the aforementioned Darkwatch, and Call of Juarez (althou…",

I am talking about Ratatoskr, the eyepatch-wearing squirrel who watches over Yggdrasil, the world tree that holds the realms in place.\nRatatoskr technically appeared in God of War (2018), but he was less of a character and more of an ability.

According to designer and creative director Ben Esposito, the earliest iteration was in March 2019, more than three years before its release in June 2022. In that time, there were more than 50 different iterations. Sometimes changes were small. Other times they fundamentally altered the level. Every designer who worked on the game has touched Smackdown in some form. Nevertheless, load into it now; chances are all that labor is invisible to you. Before sitting down to write, I beat it in just 11 seconds.\nNeon White is a game built around speedrunning. Levels are short. If you’re playing as intended, you hardly notice your surroundings before moving on. But the only way that works effectively is if levels are meticulously designed to facilitate that movement; they have to be made so that it feels natural for the player to fly through them. Making a level you barely think twice about takes a lot of effort. Read more...",

The number, which includes physical and downloadable copies as reported by Nintendo, already places Pokémon Scarlet and Violet in the top 15 best-selling Nintendo Switch titles of all time. In this three-day number, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet have already outpaced lifetime sales of games such as Splatoon 3, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, Nintendo Switch Sports, and Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury.\nThe current overall best-selling Nintendo Switch title is Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, which has sold just over 48 million units as of the end of September. As of this writing, the Pokémon franchise occupies 3 of the top 10 slots of lifetime Nintendo Switch software sales, with Let's Go, Pikachu and Eevee at number 10, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl at number 8, and Sword and Shield at number 5. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet need to sell just under 5 million more combined copies to crack into the top 10. To date, the Nintendo Switch has sold over 114 million units.\nPokémon Scarlet and Violet represent the first time players are able to explore a fully open-world environment in a mainline Pokémon RPG. While critics praised various aspects of the newest games in the series, the technical performance has been universally panned. However, despite those concerns, Game Freak, The Pokémon Company, and Nintendo clearly have another massive hit on their hands. You can read our full review of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet here.",

Halo, one of the biggest video game franchises ever created, is about an ongoing war with aliens.

Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. A new Generate World menu which now includes NewGRF, AI, and Game Script configuration menus. Cargo filters for vehicle lists (such as at stations) to allow better visualization of traffic. Optional cargo names above vehicles in vehicle lists, to show at a glance what they carry. The ability to clone or share orders with vehicles grouped by shared orders. An improved local authority action window which now shows you actions you can’t afford, instead of hiding them. In addition, some new tools are available to AI and Game Script authors: Scriptable league tables which can replace the default scoring system AI and Game Scripts can now be modified in Scenario Editor for existing scenarios (although not savegames) (As ever, see the changelog for further details).
