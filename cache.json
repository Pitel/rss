          "description": "Makes the dream work.\nYou can tell as soon as its snazzy intro cutscene kicks in that Mario vs. Donkey Kong, a remake of 2004's Game Boy Advance puzzle-platform classic, doesn't intend to reinvent any wheels whatsoever. It fully and faithfully recreates the 20-year-old original's opening movie (albeit with a nice lick of paint) and then moves swiftly on to serve up modernised versions of all the levels you'll have played if you've been through this one before — every one of them almost identical to how you'll remember.\nYep, we've been spending plenty of time getting acquainted with Mario's latest (re)adventure over the past week or so and, four worlds in, it's pretty much as expected for the plump plumber thus far. This is an exacting retread in how it serves up levels that stick to the layouts, enemy positioning, and traversal options of its source material. Nothing much has changed here in terms of the core mechanics, puzzles, and so on that make up the bulk of the game, which is a good thing when your source material is so delightfully addictive.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

That's pretty much the full set when it comes to small form factor PC cases, so consider jumping on this one while you can! \nRead more",

The upcoming \"Kafkaesque\" immersive sim gives you the simple goal of escaping a town within a few days, a task which is somewhat complicated by the fact that a Leviathan-sized Russian cop towers over the city, watching you. In a new dev blog, developers TallBoys explain more of how you might court the giant's approval (the term \"fully fleshed dating-sim mechanic\" features) or avoid it by sneaking about while he sleeps. You might even—gasp!—do crimes. This also drew my attention to a ten-minute gameplay video they released last month and oh, yes, please.\nRead more",

Later in our Call Of Duty sessions we'd hit matchmaking with reverse psychological techniques, saying stuff like \"I bet we WON'T find a match\", to in fact, find a match. Well, thanks to an official COD blog post, my heady beliefs have been hit with the equivalent of a precision air strike. Matchmaking cannot be gamed.

Gender transition is not just an arduous journey of self-discovery, but also a profound and constant engagement with one’s own reality. I was desperate for some escapism, and Larian Studios’ much-anticipated new entry into the Baldur’s Gate fantasy RPG franchise offered the perfect rabbit hole to fall down.\nAs a child, my gaming habits were relatively stereotypical for a closeted girl: select female characters wherever possible, especially in RPGs. But the immersion almost always wears off. The trans inclusion in games like Dungeon Siege, Sacred 2: Fallen Angel, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and others is effectively non-existent, and the result for transgender and transsexual players is a feeling that, even in fantasy worlds, we are invisible at best. Nocturne, a trans supporting character in Baldur's Gate III played by Abigail Thorn, has changed that experience for me. In an interview, Thorn shared some of her thoughts and experiences regarding Nocturne and trans representation in games.\n \nRead more",

Alas, the prospect of such a project has had fresh water poured over it this weekend, with Kitase explaining that, given it's already taken them ten years to make Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (with a third entry to complete the trilogy yet to come), a Final Fantasy 6 remake would likely take twice as long as that to actually make.

Now there's too many things to look at in advance, but hey, I'm making steady progress, and you've probably seen the fruits of a couple of these this week already. Next on the list is Dystopika, a toy-like sandbox citybuilder that's sort of in the same vein as the lovely Summerhouse I played earlier this week, but also lives at the exact opposite end of the mood and vibes scale. Whereas Summerhouse is about creating diddly little cute streets with sunny Mediterranean vibes, Dystopika is effectively: Build Your Own Blade Runner. \nRead more",

Cut to several hours later and I've had to forcibly shut the game down and wrench myself away from it just to write this post, because listen, you need to go and play Balatro's demo right now, because hot damn this is the good stuff if you're into roguelike deckbuilders. I also say this as someone who's never played or understood a game of poker in her life, because let's face it, regular poker is quite boring. Balatro, on the other hand, is poker that's turbo-charged with magic Joker cards, tarot card multipliers, and blind conditions that make a successful hand increasingly tricky to pull off. And it's coming out in full real soon, too. \nRead more",

Your titular tiny heroine can't jump very far on her own, you see, so to save her beloved sunflowers from the spiky thorns of an ominous-looking tree, she'll need to fire them around the environment to help hoist her over obstacles to get to the, err, root of the problem.

But it wasn't till I embraced the holy medium of videogames that I realised the full potential of balldom. \r\n\n\r\nInitiated, of course, by Sonic the Hedgehog, I descended into a frothing ballpit of ball variations, encompassing everything from the squashy rolling UFOs of Exo One through Katamari Damacy to the overcrowded chutes of Marble World and the spectacle of Overwatch's Hammond clearing out a capture point by means of sheer, delicious torque. I am always up for a game in which you either control or become a ball, and Go Mecha Ball looks like one of the better ones.\n  \nRead more",

We continue. This week, I ask you to choose between two ways to picking your own level of challenge. What's better: different puzzles on different difficulty levels, or bullet grazing?\nRead more",

And look, here it is in Early Access. Roots isn't one of your traditional, SimCity-derived town sims in which you steadily colonise a single map (at least, until you lose patience with your glittering urban creation and press the Godzilla or Hurricane button). As per the roguelike element, it's a game about being on the run. \r\n\n\r\nIn Roots, you take charge of a band of warriors fleeing an expanding purple smog, the Ginnungagap, in a flying longship. To escape its coils, you must land on floating islands, play cards to raise settlements, and harvest energy for your vessel from the titular roots of the World Tree. Succumb to the advancing mists, and you'll time-rewind back to your Holt to unlock new mechanics and upgrades. There are also various big-league mythological celebrities to meet and recruit, and a variety of randomised encounters and events to shake up each run. Here's the launch trailer.\r\n\n Read more",

Great building, a sense of scale, a beautiful atmosphere, and the ability to die in extremely stupid ways. In Minecraft, it's digging straight down into lava. In Valheim, it's getting crushed by the very tree you'd just chopped down. And after dying for the third time by trying to climb a slightly-too-steep hill, slipping down and building enough momentum to send me careening off the cliff to my death, I realised that Enshrouded, too, ticks all the boxes for maybe one day being listed among the titans of the genre.\nOne paragraph in, and I've already compared Enshrouded to Valheim. You'll see that quite a bit throughout this review, and for good reason. Enshrouded has come the closest for me to recapturing that feeling of when the world collectively discovered Valheim for the first time. But that's both an accolade and a reservation. Because it's not quite there... yet.\n Read more",

I sit there with a big toybox of lovely things to stick together, but always end up deflated and disappointed with my own lack of imagination.

          "description": "Riot Games have announced that they will shortly lay off \"about 530\" people, or 11 per cent of their global workforce, so as to \"create focus and move us towards a more sustainable future\", in the words of CEO Dylan Jadeja. The \"biggest impact\" will be felt outside of core development, though the reductions will affect at least one major internal team - the developers of Legends Of Runeterra. Riot are also binning off the Riot Forge publishing label, under which third-party developers create smaller-scale games based on Riot's own intellectual properties.\r\n \nRead more",

I'm currently burning one called Starry Night, which is a nice fresh scent but it's nowhere near as strong as I would like. I can never find fresh scents that are as long-lingering as the fruity or woody ones. Anyway, I have been discussing my new interest (and interrupting work meetings with pretend candle unboxing videos where I tell them to like and subscribe and check out my collab with WickManiac) with the rest of the Treehouse, which prompted us to talk about the idea of gamer candles. They exist! They're just candles of lies. \nRead more",

          "description": "A new update for the PC Game Pass and Xbox versions of Palworld has fixed some of its many, many known issues today, but those hoping for some fixes to its online multiplayer options will sadly have to wait a little longer. Currently, those playing on Game Pass still don't have the ability to join or create dedicated servers for up to 32-player multiplayer like their mates on Steam can. Instead, they remain limited to just 2-4-player co-op via the use of friend codes, meaning that Game Pass players aren't having quite the same experience as their Steam counterparts. \nRead more",

          "description": "Basically the only sort of strategy games I like are city builders, so I was interested in the playtest for El Dorado: The Golden City Builder, which casts you as the leader of an ancient Mayan-ish city. The playtest is only the prologue, but the eventual goal is to take over the Yucatán peninsula, and if nothing else it's refreshing to see a city-builder that doesn't feel overwhelmingly European. It also has a complicated system of religion. Whereas in a similarly polytheistic game like Zeus, the gods would turn up to stomp on buildings and/or bless them, at fairly large intervals, in El Dorado I was getting a home immolated every few days. Building shrines that have an area of effect, and that require resources to run and protect your town, is its own supply chain in El Dorado. This is a very interesting idea that I liked.\nBut. The aforementioned deities are figures from Maya mythology, and the Yucatán peninsula is the bit where the Mayans lived, so I just find it a bit sus the word \"Mayan\" does not appear anywhere on the Steam page or in the press release materials. Sometimes said materials say \"the Yucatán peninsula\", and sometimes \"the mystical land of Jukatan\", which could well be an innocent translation mistake, but doesn't make me less sus. I've hedged my bets by saying \"Mayan-ish\" - just as an uncharitable person could say the devs are doing...\nRead more",

Mojang and Microsoft released the Godzilla-themed DLC by Japanese studio Team-KYO on the Minecraft Marketplace today. According to the Minecraft blog, players will start in movie theater screening rooms before picking one of four adventures from the iconic Godzilla films.\n\n\n\n\nGodzilla!\n\n\nLook, know Minecraft gets a ton of DLC. And honestly, I'm usually not too interested in it. But come on, it's Godzilla! Obviously, the King of Monsters himself is featured in the DLC, but based on the trailer, other monsters will be making an appearance including Gigan, King Kong, and King Ghidorah. Maybe we'll even see Mechagodzilla, right?\n\n\nIt looks like each of the four adventures in the DLC has its own gameplay modes. The blog told us about two. In the first, players have to flee from Godzilla in an escape mission. In the second, players are tasked with speed building to create walls and obstructions in an attempt to contain Godzilla and save the city. All four adventures can be played in multiplayer and have unique rewards for completing and exploring them.\n\n\nThe Minecraft Godzilla DLC is available now on the Minecraft Marketplace for 1510 Minecoins. The closest amount to that you can purchase is 1720 Minecoins for $9.99.\n\nThe post Minecraft unleashes The King of Monsters with Godzilla DLC appeared first on Destructoid.",

In a recreation of the signature The Walking Dead opening title scene, the teaser shows scenes from around COD's Verdansk map while playing The Walking Dead theme music. The collab will drop alongside Season 2 on February 7 and feature Rick and Michonne, assumingly as new Operators.\n\n\n\n\nQuite the lineup\n\n\nThe Call of Duty Operator lineup is getting pretty insane, right? Rick and Michonne are joining the ranks of Homelander, Kevin Durant, TimTheTatman, Snoop Dogg, Lara Croft, Spawn, 21 Savage, Skeletor, and even Lilith from Diablo 4. Oh, there's more, that just seemed like some of the crazier ones. When I first heard about these additions I thought it was insane. I mean let's be real it's still weird getting teamkilled by Nicki Minaj and then watching her go on to shoot pink tracer rounds on Terminal.\n\n\nHowever, Rick and Michonne will probably fit in a bit more, at least in Call of Duty: MW3's new Warzone-like Zombie mode. Rick better have a \"CAAAAAARRRLLLL!\" voice line or I am going to be disappointed.\n\n\nCall of Duty Modern Warfare 3 and Call of Duty: Warzone both enter Season 2 on February 7 on all platforms.\n\nThe post Call of Duty teases The Walking Dead collab featuring Rick and Michonne appeared first on Destructoid.",

A mysterious phenomenon is taking over the shrines throughout Sanctuary, empowering them. By activating these shrines players will earn 50% bonus XP, have their movement speed increased by 30%, and will earn Ancestor's Favor reputation. The event goes live on February 6 at 1 p.m. EST and will run for two weeks until February 20 at 1 p.m. EST. Unlike some events that have been exclusive to seasonal servers, this event will be active on the Eternal Realms as well.\n\n\n\n\nMoon, wake up!\n\n\nWith the Lunar Awakening event, players can visit a new hub in the northern section of Ked Bardu. There players will find a new NPC, Ying- Yue, and the Lunar Night Market. As players find and activate Lunar Shrines throughout Sanctuary—including in dungeons—they will gain the experience and movement speed buff while also earning Ancestor's Favor reputation for slaying enemies while under the effects of the Lunar Shrines.\n\n\nWith the new reputation, players will ascend through ten reputation levels and obtain event-exclusive Lunar-themed rewards. There are six unique rewards in total, and look to be all different types of cosmetics including a Mount, Mount Armor, weapon skins, armor, and more.\n\n\nAlso part of the event, Nightmare Dungeon Sigils can have the Ancestor's Favor affix during the event. This affix guarantees that only Lunar Shrines will spawn in the dungeon, and also gives 10% bonus Glyph XP for completing the dungeon.\n\n\nThe event sounds rather simplistic in nature, which sort of seems to be the trend so far with Diablo 4 Season 3. Of course, I'm always up for bonus XP and the ability to earn some cool free cosmetics.\n\n\nThe Diablo 4 Lunar Awakening Event goes live on February 6 across all platforms.\n\nThe post Diablo 4 Lunar Awakening Event calls on the power of the moon next week appeared first on Destructoid.",

It seems like these are all just cosmetic skins for the various items in Destiny 2.

          "description": "Fantasy 4X Strategy title Age of Wonders 4 is set to get its next content pack, Primal Fury. Triumph Studios and Paradox Interactive revealed today that Age of Wonders 4: Primal Fury will get the primal beast-themed pack on February 27 across all platforms. The content pack adds a handful of new features and content to the popular 4X title with a focus on a new Primal Culture system.\n\n\n\n\nChannel your Primal Culture\n\n\nThe new Primal Culture system allows players to channel an animal spirit that influences and shapes their empire both physically and spiritually. The Tome of Fey Mists and the Tome of Stormborne are two new Tomes of Magic added to the content pack, and include spells to conceal troops in shrouded magical fog and gain advantages over seas and shorelines.\n\n\nIn total, there are seven primal animals that the people of your empire can worship. New quests allow you to follow specific primal anima to earn unique rewards. Your people can even take on new physical forms in tune with the animals, including Lupine and Goatkin.\n\n\nAlso releasing alongside the Primal Fury content pack is the free Wolf Update. While Primal Fury is a paid content pack, the free Wolf Update will add new features and improvements for all players. In the Wolf Update, Necromancy has received a rework, new randomly generated items have been added, and War Bounties allow you to better direct your allies in conflicts.\n\n\nAge of Wonders 4: Primal Fury releases on February 27 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S for $9.99.

          "description": "Bitwise Reprise has announced that their 2023 NES title, Jane Austen’s 8-bit Adventure is available now for purchase on a physical NES cartridge.\n\n\nNot really the subject matter I expect on an NES game, but it would look great next to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Jane Austen’s 8-bit Adventure is a platformer that stars the 19th-century novelist and author of Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen. According to the summary, she finds herself in an 8-bit video game and must “Restore Miss Austen's books to the 8-bit library!”\n\n\n\n\nWhile the art doesn’t look great in the trailer, the game itself shows shades of Castlevania. Jane Austen battles stuffy British-types using a quill and battles characters from her novels.\n\n\nIf you’re not convinced, Jane Austen’s 8-bit Adventure is already available on PC and is, understandably, quite a bit cheaper than shelling out for the cartridge.\n\n\nI’ve said this before, but homebrew has come a long way in the past few years. I found a lot of physical releases a decade ago to be of rather questionable quality, but that’s largely because they were just hobbyist projects, and learning to program for a 6502 processor is more of a dedicated enthusiast’s undertaking. Even if you did manage to create something worth publishing, it wasn’t easy finding someone willing to produce NES cartridges. NESmaker has made developing for the ancient platform a lot more accessible, but from the looks of things, Jane Austen’s 8-bit Adventure was created the old-fashioned way.\n\n\nJane Austen’s 8-bit Adventure is available for PC and NES.\n\nThe post Jane Austen’s 8-bit Adventure is now available on an NES cartridge appeared first on Destructoid.",

Today we learned it was just a big mistake.\n\n\nGame Pass owners thought they had a gem inbound for the subscription platform. X users, like Idle Sloth below, celebrated the Xbox reveal of the big Day One get.\n\n\n\n\nEurogamer reached out to Microsft to get clarification on the listing. A Microsoft spokesperson responded to the outlet to confirm that the mention of Game Pass was indeed a mistake. \n\n\n\"We're aware that Xbox.com included language that indicated Visions of Mana was coming to Xbox Game Pass and can confirm this was an error,\" the spokesperson told Eurogamer. Microsoft concluded its statement by confirming: \"We do not have plans to bring Visions of Mana to Game Pass at this time.\"\n\n\nWhen Microsoft rolled out its Xbox Developer's Direct on January 23, Visions of Mana was a surprise inclusion within the showcase. The game looked great, and Series X|S owners were rightfully excited to finally get some love from Square Enix on their platform. \n\n\nWith the promotional partnership between Xbox and Square Enix during the Developer's Direct, fans who spotted the Game Pass mention on the Vision of Mana page would have little reason to doubt the game's inclusion. Now, it looks like Xbox Series X|S owners will have to purchase the awesome-looking action-RPG when it releases alongside PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC versions later this summer.\n\nThe post Xbox says Visions of Mana isn’t coming to Game Pass appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Lucid Dreams Studio has announced that their “dark metroidvania,” Biomorph is slated to release on March 4. Alongside the announcement is a new animated trailer that, out of context, tells very little.\n\n\nThat’s okay, because more informative trailers have already been released. I opened one in Steam, and after watching a bit of it, I switched back to writing this, and the video kept playing in the background. I can tell there are a lot of gooey effects in there because, past the halfway point of the trailer, it begins to sound like someone is eating a can of tuna using only their tongue set to epic music.\n\n\n\n\nPointless musing aside, Biomorph looks like a pretty slick game in the gated exploration style. The big draw is that the gooey protagonist can take the form of some of the enemies in the game, which strikes me as a good substitute for keys and a great mechanic to base puzzle-solving on.\n\n\nBut beyond the usual hop-and-collect gameplay, you also get to customize a village. You’re tasked with rebuilding the town of Brightmoor and befriending its inhabitants. By the looks of things, you can pick from a variety of styles for the buildings. Looks light, unobtrusive, and satisfying.\n\n\n“Metroidvania” isn’t my favorite genre, but it’s one that I’m no stranger to. Of the many that seem to be circling toward release, Biomorph looks like the most appealing to me. Something about the visuals exudes a love for the world the developers are building, dark as it is.\n\n\nBiomorph will be released on March 4 for PC. An extended demo will be available for Steam Next Fest.\n\nThe post Gooey exploration platformer Biomorph arrives on March 4 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "We know that MSI is attempting to take on the likes of the Steam Deck with its own device called The Claw. There were also leaks suggesting how much the handheld would cost, and now prices have been confirmed by the tech company.\n\n\nAs noted by Videocardz, MSI has listed three variants of its upcoming mobile gaming PC on its website. As you can see, they're not exactly the cheapest. You'll be having to fork over $699.99 for the lower end model, while the two more expensive ones will cost $749.99 and $799.99, respectively.\n\n\n\n\nIf you opt for the first, you'll get a Claw device that's powered by the Intel Core Ultra-5 processor. The midrange model will have the Ultra-7, as will the priciest one, but that will have 1TB of storage instead of 512GB.\n\n\nA potential USP\n\n\nAlso, MSI's device will be utilizing the Intel Arc graphics chip technology, something which the Steam Deck, ASUS ROG Ally, and Lenovo Legion Go don't have (these all use AMD). Whether this will be a unique selling point for The Claw is anyone's guess at this stage.\n\n\nAs far as specs go, it's going to give the Deck a run for its money, offering up slightly more advanced hardware, including a better screen and supposed stronger battery life. However, with that extra juice comes the price tag to match.\n\n\nThe other thing to say about The Claw is it uses Windows 11. That's not inherently a bad thing, but the good thing about the Deck is that it's gaming ready, linking users up to their Steam account from the first boot-up. That could be a win in Valve's favor, but MSI and other competitors could also get the edge by offering more powerful handhelds.\n\nThe post MSI’s The Claw device will set you back at least $700 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Certainly, there are instances where the Destiny 2 community struggles to agree on certain things, but things just fall into place sometimes. Take, for example, Bungie's latest The Witcher-themed mini-event, which has been completed in quite a short amount of time, actually.\n\n\nAs part of its previous This Week in Destiny blog post, Bungie announced that it'd hold a special community event that officially kicked off at 12 AM PST, on January 25. From that point onwards, players would need to kill 7,777,777 enemies before a unique (and free) Witcher-themed goodie unlocked: the Adventurous Spirit emblem. A mere emblem might not be quite as exciting of a tidbit as the big Destiny and Witcher crossover was, at the start of the Season, but it's a neat bonus all the same, and Guardians can now claim the emblem.\n\n\nThat's right - the Destiny 2 community has successfully sliced through almost 8 million foes in just over five days' worth of time. Whether that's impressive or disturbing to imagine, we'll leave it to you to decide.\n\n\n\n\nClaim Destiny 2: Adventurous Spirit today, whether you participated or not\n\n\nAll cheekiness aside, Destiny 2's Adventurous Spirit is a neat little emblem, and you can unlock it for use in-game whether you participated in the event or not. To do so, you can either use Bungie's own embedded link, or go to Destiny 2's official website and open up the Emblem Redeem widget that way. The activation code is 9FY-KDD-PRT.\n\n\n\n\nAnd hey, if you - like yours truly - never did end up contributing anything to the event, you can still grab the emblem regardless. From the looks of it, plenty of us haven't really gotten around to participating, so it's a good thing that nobody's left out of the equation this time around. Heck, a snazzy new emblem might be just the thing that draws you in to complete a few of Riven's Wishes over the next couple of weeks.\n\nThe post Destiny 2 community unlocks Witcher-themed Adventurous Spirit emblem appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It seems we're spoiled for choice at the moment when it comes to Early Access survival games inspired by other franchises. Palworld has been making more money than God, but Keen Games' recently released Enshrouded has been doing pretty well, too.\n\n\nA recent Twitter/X post from the developer is proud to announce that its title has \"reached over one million players.\" This is after just four days. While that may pale in comparison to Palworld's six million sold in a similar timeframe, it's still a massive accomplishment.\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, Enshrouded is currently at the number three spot on Steam's Top Sellers list, just behind \"Pokémon-with guns\" – with Steam Deck still at number one, because of course it is. Whether either of these can be toppled by the newcomer remains to be seen at this stage.\n\n\nWhat is Enshrouded?\n\n\nIf you haven't played it yet, Enshrouded is a survival and crafting game that's taking cues from the likes of Valheim. It's \"set within a sprawling voxel-based continent\" and tasks you with a journey \"across the mountains and deserts of an open world.\"\n\n\nIt's currently only out on Steam at the moment, but Keen Games is \"keen\" (ha!) to release it on the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, hopefully later this year.\n\n\nIt definitely feels like this genre is getting quite full at the moment. There's just something about games that encapsulate survival released in alpha or beta states that's appealing to a lot of people. Last year it was Sons of the Forest, and now we've got Palworld and Enshrouded. \n\n\nHowever, given that the latter has a current player peak of 160,405, according to SteamDB, it's probably not likely to take on the might of the former.\n\nThe post Enshrouded has sold a million copies, is just behind Palworld on Steam charts appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Frontier Developments has announced on Twitter that Planet Zoo is coming to consoles. What consoles? I don’t know. When? I don’t know that, either.\n\n\nIt’s happening, though! Frontier Developments dropped a teaser that shows a controller sitting on a breakroom coffee table (I think) while something unrelated goes on in the background. That’s it. You now know everything that I know.\n\n\n\n\nThat is unless you haven’t played Planet Zoo. Initially released in 2019 as a companion (spin-off?) of 2016’s Planet Coaster, it’s a management sim about building and running your own zoo. The Planet games are all about filling the gap left by games like Roller Coaster Tycoon and Zoo Tycoon. However, I feel they have their own distinct flavor.\n\n\nWhat I mean by that is that Planet Zoo feels like it’s more about customization and building your dream zoo than it is about challenging you to keep it profitable and successful. Don’t get me wrong, there’s still some of that. You do need to keep your zoo profitable and successful, but it just feels so easy. Or maybe it’s just easy for me because I grew up on a hearty diet of tycoon games. I can’t tell anymore.\n\n\nHowever, to me, it felt more like it gave you a tonne of tools and assets to allow you to customize your habitats at a very granular level. This would have really appealed to young Zoey, but old Zoey doesn’t have the same free time or attention span. I do have to wonder how the UI and all those tools will translate to a controller, but we’ll have to wait and see.\n\n\nFor now, you can grab Planet Zoo on PC. Having spent a few paragraphs talking about it, I think I'm going to reinstall.\n\nThe post Planet Zoo is coming to consoles appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "HoYoverse has released another round of its usual character teases for Genshin Impact, and if previous patterns hold up, it's a peak into Version 4.5. However, there's only one new character showcased this time, and it’s someone you might already be familiar with: Chiori of Chioriya Boutique.\n\n\nChiori’s element, weapon, and Constellation\n\n\nChiori’s drip marketing clearly shows her elemental Vision and weapons, locking her in as a Geo Sword user from Inazuma. Her art features a pair of wakizashi or small katana, showcasing a unique dual-wielding style. This isn’t entirely without precedent, since Alhaitham’s animations feature an additional sword on top of the one he normally equips. The remainder of Chiori's kit is yet to be revealed.\n\n\nWe've encountered Chiori before as an NPC during 4.3's Roses and Muskets event. She served as the costume designer for The Two Musketeers during the Fontinalia Film Festival. Now, Chiori is formally introduced as \"The Thundering Seamstress\" and Boss of Chioriya Boutique. We already knew that she was the boss of this small clothing store in the Court of Fontaine, and we got a taste of her direct, no-nonsense attitude during the event quests. It appears we'll soon witness her in combat as well.\n\n\nImage via HoYoverse\n\n\nChiori’s Constellation is Cisoria, Latin for “scissors.” It's quite fitting for her as a fashion designer and seamstress. It might also serve as a subtle reference to her sharp wit and incisive personality.\n\n\nWhen is Chiori coming to Genshin Impact?\n\n\nSince Chiori’s introduction happened on the eve of Version 4.4, we can expect to see her sometime in Version 4.5 of Genshin Impact. If the six-week update schedule holds, Version 4.5 should start on March 13.\n\nThe post Genshin Impact brings a headstrong seamstress to its 4.5 character line-up appeared first on Destructoid.",

Africa as a whole has been largely neglected by the company, usually lumping it in with Europe when it comes to matters of release days. That may be about to change soon, thanks to an investment in Cape Town-based publisher Carry1st. \n\n\nThe company specializes in facilitating Africans buying games using local infrastructure, but it's been creeping its way into the development market as well, and three new games are in the works. CEO Cordel Robbin-Coker told CNBC that they hope to support Sony in a variety of ways, including digital payments.

The new Eternal Hunt mod offers an excellent excuse to do just that.\n\n\nThe Witcher 3 has a decent modding scene, though it still falls behind some of the most-moddable games from Bethesda and the like.

          "description": "As part of the 1,900 job cuts that Microsoft made last week, perhaps the most surprising was the coinciding departure of Blizzard president Mike Ybarra. It has been announced that Ybarra’s position will be taken over by Johanna Faries, an executive who helped oversee recent Call of Duty titles at Activision.\n\n\nYbarra stepped into the role of company president in 2021 with the departure of then-president J. Allen Brack, following reports of sexual misconduct, harassment, and discrimination within Blizzard. Ybarra initially shared the role with Jen Oneal but became the sole president when Oneal left the company shortly after.\n\n\nPrior to starting work at Activision Blizzard in 2018, Faries was an NFL executive. Her work with Call of Duty was largely in regards to its esports league.\n\n\nThere was some concern by fans that Microsoft would install their own leadership to the company following Ybarra’s departure. While this isn’t the case, as Faries was already working at Activision Blizzard, I’m not sure it’s going to be of much comfort. Or maybe it will be if you’re someone who enjoys the esports side of Blizzard’s games. I don’t really have much of a horse in this race.\n\n\nFaries introduced herself to Blizzard employees in an email where she identifies herself as a Diablo IV fan. She states that she’s aware that Call of Duties priorities differ from the way Blizzard does things and says she walks “into this role with sensitivity to those dynamics, and deep respect for Blizzard, as we begin to explore taking our universes to even higher heights.”\n\nThe post Blizzard gets a new president from the Activision side of things appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "According to reporting by Bloomberg, Embracer Group is laying off 97 of the staff at Eidos Montreal and has canceled an unannounced title in the Deus Ex series. This is part of an ongoing series of job losses as Embracer contracts after a period of rapid expansion.\n\n\nThe Embracer Group acquired Eidos Montreal as part of a deal with Square Enix in 2022, which saw the latter company divest from its North American studios. This deal also included Square Enix Montreal and Crystal Dynamics, as well as a selection of properties related to those studios, including games like Thief, Tomb Raider, and Deus Ex.\n\n\nMany have been anticipating a new game in the celebrated Deus Ex series since the release of Deus Ex: Mankind Divided back in 2016. Following the lukewarm reception to that game, Square Enix put the series on ice. The Embracer purchase brought some hope to having the series revived once again, but with this cancellation, it seems unlikely.\n\n\nAccording to Bloomberg’s sources, Eidos Montreal had been working on the new entry of Deus Ex for two years, and it was “slated to enter production later this year.” The company will now “instead focus on an original franchise.”\n\n\nA release by Eidos Montreal confirms the layoffs and clarifies that 97 positions were eliminated, it’s a continuation of job losses related to Embracer Group. The losses have included the closure of Timesplitters developer Free Radical and Saints Row’s Volition. \n\n\nIt can be difficult to keep up with the volume of cuts made by Embracer, as it seems that a new round happens on a near-weekly basis. Embracer group is hardly the only company cutting staff, however, as massive job losses have been happening across the industry, with Microsoft laying off 1,900 staff members just a few days ago.\n\n\nWe’re not even out of January yet, and the industry has seen nearly 6000 people lose their jobs. It’s shaping up to be another rough year.\n\nThe post Embracer Group reportedly cancels Deus Ex game, lays off workers at Eidos Montreal appeared first on Destructoid.",

Sony's next State of Play showcase is airing this week.\n\n\nThe first State of Play for 2024 comes Wednesday, January 31 at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET, which happens to be the last day of the month. We only have a small idea of what's going to be in the 40-minute show, save for a few titles, but that's part of the experience. In the announcement, it is stated that we'll see over 15 games during the event.\n\n\n\n\nGames announced include Rise of the Ronin and Stellar Blade, which will receive extended looks. I'm particularly interested in Rise of the Ronin and how it will differentiate itself from aesthetically similar games that have flooded the market.\n\n\nThis year's showcase arrives a bit earlier than last year's first State of Play, but other companies have already been off to the races with their lineups for 2024. Xbox recently hosted its 2024 Developer Direct, locking in some release windows for games like Avowed, Hellbade 2, and Indiana Jones.\n\n\nNintendo, which usually has a February stream of some kind, still has yet to lock in a Direct. Most of the noise around it has been rumors and reports on a potential Switch successor. Whether or not we see a new Switch in 2024 has yet to be confirmed. But with Sony stepping up to the plate, we might start to get an idea of what their year ahead looks like.\n\n\nYou can watch the event on Twitter, YouTube, and Twitch. \n\nThe post First PlayStation State of Play for 2024 airs on Wednesday appeared first on Destructoid.",

Weapons and playable characters alike undergo acute surges and declines based on several factors, with the most prevalent being player behavior. Years ago, Pathfinder reigned supreme across casual and competitive matches; his grapple hook-centric mobility and inconsistent hitbox made him an unrivaled duelist until his ability cooldowns and physique were tweaked. Similarly, the Prowler SMG once rivaled its light ammo counterparts before the Selectfire Receiver – a legendary hop-up that converted the weapon's burstfire to automatic – was removed from the loot pool.

Unfortunately, you can't buy these booster packs individually; instead, you must purchase special collections like the Elite Trainer Box or the Tech Sticker Collection. \nDespite this unconventional release method, Paldean Fates adds an absolutely massive number of cards to the Pokémon Trading Card Game. Those trying to collect them all have more than 240 cards to look for, including more than 135 etched-foil cards and several Trainer cards.\nThe Pokémon Company sent along a few of the collections and products that contain Paldean Fates booster packs so we could crack them open to see what we could pull. While I'm usually most excited about the Pokémon themselves, one of my favorite pulls this time was a Trainer card: the Nemona full-art Ultra Rare. But that's not to say I didn't pull my fair share of great cards starring some of my favorite Pokémon. I'm always a sucker for a cool Charizard card, and I love the Shiny Toedscruel ex that I found in one of the packs.\n\nPokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet – Paldean Fates is available now. For more Pokémon TCG content, including galleries of past expansions, interviews, and the latest news, head to our hub by clicking the banner below.",

The former title, previously known as Project Eve, is a stylish action-adventure game that's been teased since 2019. The last we heard, it was delayed into this year, so we're due for a proper look. The latter game is the next project from Team Ninja, the developers behind the Nioh series. It's the studio's most ambitious project to date – check out our December preview here.\nAs for the other 13+ games, we don't have much of an idea. We know it won't include Naughty Dog's recently canceled Last of Us multiplayer spin-off, and we've gone a while without big reveals for a lot of Sony's first-party studios, so hopefully, it can shed some light on the rest of the company's 2024.\nWhat are you hoping to see at Wednesday's State of Play?

I wrote Game Informer's Skull and Bones cover story back in 2022, and have played the game several times since then in previews, betas, and more. \nDespite what various delays had me believing, Skull and Bones is actually shaping up to be, at the very least, a fun and competent experience.

While the game will continue to receive support until then, its final story campaign will serve as its last big hurrah. \nReincarnation first launched on July 28, 2021 for iOS and Android and takes place within an unspecified point in the Nier timeline. Like the previous titles, Reincarnation is an RPG set within a mysterious prison world called The Cage, with players controlling different protagonists divided across multiple story arcs. The game has also hosted several crossover events with games such as the remake of Nier Replicant, Final Fantasy XIV, and Persona 5.\nThe shutdown news came the same day as the launch of the latest chapter of its final story arc, The People And The World, dubbed Act II: The Return. Check out the trailer below.\n\n\nIn a shutdown notice, Square Enix states, \nUntil service concludes, Square Enix will offer 10 free summons per day, weekly gem gifts, and other perks. Sales of items on the Premium Shop have ceased. You can read the full rollout of final updates and events in Square Enix's blog post. \nFormer editor Jason Guisao was impressed with Nier Reincarnation, hailing it in an opinion piece as one of the strongest mobile titles available, writing that \"Lengthy narratives and skill-based gameplay loops have come in console/PC-ports like Genshin Impact and PUBG Mobile. Nier Reincarnation, however, employs a happy medium. Heartfelt plotlines with striking visuals, Keiichi Okabe’s mesmerizing score, unintrusive microtransactions, and simple, but rewarding, combat controls establish Reincarnation as one of the best console-like games on mobile devices.\"",

For reference, it took Marvel's Spider-Man 2, a PlayStation 5-exclusive game starring arguably the most popular superhero in the world, 11 days to cross the 5 million mark. This roadmap includes PvP, raid bosses and other endgame content, Steam-Xbox crossplay, bug fixes, additional features, and more. \nIf you've managed to dodge the discussion around Palworld, which has taken the internet, Steam, and Xbox by storm, Game Informer has a great primer for you to read right here.

          "description": "Nintendo revealed during a Direct last September Splatoon 3's Side Order DLC would be coming to the game sometime in the spring of this year. Now, just a few months later, Nintendo has revealed exactly when: February 22, 2024. That's when Wave 2 of the Splatoon 3 expansion pass, which features Side Order as the star of the show, goes live, and it's when players can explore the Spire of Order, a brand new location. \nNintendo announced this news with a short teaser trailer today that shows Agent 8 sleeping on a train. The teaser then transitions to the Spire of Order where a mysterious voice is calling out to Agent 8. \nCheck it out for yourself below in the Splatoon 3 Side Order DLC release date trailer: \n\n\nFor the uninitiated, Agent 8 is the protagonist from Splatoon 2's Octo Expansion. In Side Order, Agent 8 will meet a new character named Acht, who claims to go \"way back\" with Marina, one of the hosts of Splatoon 2. Marina's co-host, Pearl, seems to make an appearance of sorts in Side Order as a robot that accompanies Agent 8 on their journey. \nWith the Spire of Order devoid of color, Acht gives Agent 8 color chips to modify their abilities, like boosting run speed and increasing damage. It's likely Agent 8's colored ink will be used to bring color back to the spire, too, but we'll have to wait until February 22 to find out. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's Splatoon 3 review, and then check out what else is in the Splatoon 3 expansion pass. \nAre you going to check out Side Order next month?
