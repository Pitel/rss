Okay, you'll still be moving blocks and finding keys, but it's different, alright?!\nDeveloper of Baba Is You, Hempuli, occasionally makes tiny games on itch.io, some of which are to do with Baba (or Keke, another one of the game's characters). There's Baba Is You XTREME, which has real physics and no grid; Baba Friend, which adds a little Baba to your desktop; It's A Me, an unplayable Mario-like platformer; and now, arguably the best spin-off of all...\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Developed by Mitchell Corporation and released in arcades in 1996, thanks to a limited run of arcade machines for the game in the west, this side-scrolling gem was once lost to time. But very soon — 9th March according to the North American Nintendo eShop — we'll finally be able to play this classic on home consoles for the very first time, thanks to ININ Games.\nSo, what's the big deal other than this being a once-lost gem? Koichi \"Isuke\" Yotsui, the director behind Capcom's legendary Strider, was the lead designer on Cannon Dancer - Osman, and he's gone on record calling this game \"my Strider 2\" (we'll forget about the real Strider 2 for a second).\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "12 rings to rule them all.\nHappy New Year, Fire Emblem fans! And what a start to 2023 it looks like being for all you tactical RPG aficionados, as Intelligent Systems' Fire Emblem Engage gets set to drop onto Switch in just a handful of weeks. We've already been busy blasting through the game over the Christmas holiday period and, at around about 12 hours into the main campaign, we reckon there's plenty of reason to get very excited about the imminent arrival of this one.\nFire Emblem Engage introduces a colourful new continent in the form of Elyos, alongside an expansive new cast of characters who get to mix it up with a host of Emblem legends from across the series' history. The story here sees you assume the role of Alear, the red and blue-eyed Divine Dragon who's been awakened from a 1000-year slumber in order to go toe-to-toe with Sombron, the Fell Dragon, an ancient beast who's got his mind set on world domination. In order to stand any chance of defeating this newly-resurrected enemy, Alear is gonna need to venture across the length and breadth of the game's gorgeous world in search of magical Emblem Rings which contain the power of legendary heroes. Only Alear has the ability to call forth the Emblem warriors from the rings, and they're going to need every last one of them by their side in order to prevail.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The RPS Treehouse even named the bullet hell beast the best game of 2022 In a Steam community blog, developer Poncle celebrated the mega-successful year they just had, highlighting their accolades and the fact they were the most played game on Steam Deck over the last six months - half of that playtime probably came from me in my bed; you’re welcome, Poncle. But, despite their Vampire-y success, the devs have already begun to tease something \"not exclusively related\" to their big hit.\r\n\n \nRead more",

A feel-good novelty story in the news! What many news outlets politely neglected to mention is that, to the delight and horror of the gathered crowds, Thor had a big ol' wank in front of everyone. Thankfully, one chronicler of modern English culture is brave enough to capture this moment. Yes, absolutely a walrus cracking one off is now in Duke Smoochem, that astonishing upcoming Duke Nukem 3D level made by Dan Douglas.\nRead more",

You're more likely enjoying a few hours of peace and quiet after a week with family and wishing Jools would hurry the whole thing along.\r\n\nThat sounds like a perfect time to peruse your gaming library and wonder what you could play. Look at all those games you haven't got round to yet! Maybe 2023 should be the year you really commit to learning Dwarf Fortress, now the Steam version is out. Maybe this is the year you finally give an MMO a try or see your first JRPG to completion. Or maybe this year you're going to uninstall your backlog in its entirety and just accept you're only ever going to play Spelunky from now on.\r\n\nWhat are your gaming ambitions for 2023?

While most of the games I've snuck the odd minutes with – I hesitate to say hours – made it onto our Advent Calendar for Horace’s approval, the three below were a few that made me and my family smile at different points throughout 2022. Roll on 2023 - and even more games.\r\n\n\r\nPossibly my most magical Christmas as a kid was in 1997, aged 12. I got a Saturn and an issue of the UK’s Official Sega Saturn Magazine that had a Christmas NiGHTS Into Dreams disc on the cover. I reckon that it was my favourite, most unabashedly fun time for gaming ever (outside my decades fiddling around on PC, obvs). Indie platformer Lunistice is a blatant love letter to the 32-bit era, and the kind of game that largely skipped the poor old Saturn.\r\n\n\r\nYou guide Hana the Tanuki about as she dreams, aiming to get her to the Moon. Hana properly speeds along, bouncing and spinning her tail to thwack enemies with a lovely splat effect. Devs A Grumpy Fox have really nailed the classic 90s platformer vibe, thanks to all the different dreamworlds that Hana gets to careen through. Don’t expect something open-world like Sonic Frontiers, because Lunistice is deliberately meant to be a linear, short experience. Good grief, could we use more of those. \r\n \nRead more",

Off I went to make a list, running down the published pieces and clicking whichever ones I thought were good. Then I looked at my list and said \"Oh, no!\", because it was extremely long. I cut it down by about half to get what we have here, a collection of interviews and thinky pieces and silly pieces and wonderful pieces from 2022.\nRead more",

          "description": "It's a well-documented fact here at RPS that I love a good spreadsheet. Specifically, my spreadsheet that lists all the lovely games I manage to play each year. I've been looking at that spreadsheet a lot in recent weeks, and I'm pleased to report that most of my top game picks from this year have successfully made their way into the RPS Advent Calendar. There were plenty that didn't, of course (pouring one out for you, Dorfromantik, Flat Eye, Dome Keeper and Lost In Play), but such is the way of things when your current list of completed games for the year is teetering on the verge of 50. \nNo word of a lie, I would probably be here all day if I laid out my entire long list of honourable mentions for 2022 (additional shoutouts to Railbound, Cursed To Golf, God Of War, Weird West, Jack Move, Hard West 2 and The Kids We Were), but for the sake of all involved (and poor Alice Bee's editing pencil), I've narrowed it down to a shortlist of three. (Do still go and check out those other games, though. They're all absolutely rad).\nRead more",

I’m adamant that those games deserve their share of recognition at the end of the year, which is why my honourable mentions celebrate 2022’s new entries into some of my favourite ongoing series.\nRead more",

Over the past twelve months, the RPS treehouse and our merry band of freelancers have reviewed 168 games in total - and that includes early access reviews, PC-port reviews, group reviews, reviews-in-progresses, and your common or garden fully-fledged reviews. 168! Damn. Even though game releases are still suffering from pandemic pushbacks, 2022 has been a busy year for games. There wasn't a huge number of big name releases - although the ones that did come out were plenty big enough - but, as always, we've had a wealth of wonderful indies releasing all year round, and we scooped up as many of them as we could.\nOut of all the games we’ve given any kind of review treatment throughout the year, only a handful of them recieved RPS’s coveted Bestest Best badge; just 23, to be exact. I've gathered them all in one big round-up bundle below (there are round-ups of our favourite bits from other sections of the site, too), and they make a great collection of games.

          "description": "Guides work is a very strange beast, and one that we don't talk about as often as we maybe should. By its nature, we here in guidestown can feel a bit isolated from the rest of RPS. Our guides aren't very visible to our regular readers. No one hops onto a website like this and says to themselves, \"Well now! I wonder what guides have been written today that I can spend my time reading through!\". The vast majority of people who read our guides come straight from a Google search into something specific like \"Can I romance Yennefer and Triss at the same time?\" (spoiler alert: you can, but it may not end well for you).\nBecause we operate so much behind the scenes, it's easy to miss some of the amazing stuff that the team did in guidestown this year. It ain't easy, writing a walkthrough or how-to that's useful for the reader while simultaneously appeasing those nebulous and mercurial SEO gods. But 2022 has been a stonkingly good year for guides, and I'd love to take a little bit of time to shine a light on some of the things we're most proud of having achieved this year - and to toast what will hopefully be another smashing year for guides in 2023!\n Read more",

There are a lot of posts coming up (if we include the Advent Calendar posts that have already gone, we have 50-ish bits of hashtag seasonal hashtag content this year, which I think is the most I've had to schedule for a Christmas break yet), but almost everything after this point is a scheduled post, made of time travel words written days or weeks ago. I'm live and uncensored, baby. I'm going to fire up Among Trees. Let's go and be alone together. But don't worry, I take my responisbility seriously, so I'll make sure the final word is a joke.\nRead more",

          "description": "It's a well known fact that there are \"Too Many Games\"(TM) these days. I have not done the maths, but I've seen enough graphs, tweets and analysis from people who have crunched the numbers to know there are more games coming out on Steam every day than a site like RPS could ever possibly hope to cover a single month, let alone every week. But gosh darn it if we don't try our hardest all the same. \nInevitably, though, time does get the better of us sometimes (or, in my case at least, maybe my eyes are just too big for my gaming stomach), and certain games end up slipping further and further down our to-do lists until they eventually fall away entirely. Not through any fault of their own, mind. Just... time. But as a final parting shoutout for 2022, I wanted to memorialise all the games that fell of my personal to-do list this year and say, \"I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN IT, I PROMISE!\" (For real, though, I still want to talk about all of these at some point. Maybe January...? Please don't hate me)   \nRead more",

If the goal is to repeat a course 20 times to trim 0.2 seconds off a number, and not to cackle like a petty chaos gremlin as you slam someone off the track at a tight corner, I am probably not going to enjoy myself much.\nRush Rally 3 isn't all that serious, but it's still on the wrong side of the tracks for me, I thought, before accidentally playing it for 3 hours. This is an excellent bundle of rally trials, challenges, and simple circuit racing with a cheerfully mid-2000s feel. I might prefer the messy nonsense of Trail Out, but if you value actual driving skill more highly, this is well worth your time.\nRead more",

But also it was December the 16th, so I saw fit to waste his time asking a bunch of fun seasonal questions that blended the love and goodwill of Baldur's Gate 3, with the companion-wrangling and clutch strategy of Christmas. D'you see what I did there?\nMy questions are in bold, and Vincke's answers are undeneath - and they are both amusing and instructive.

Perhaps it's because Christmas and VR headsets go together like mangers and Messiahs, or perhaps its because virtual reality is the only place I'm likely to see sunlight before March. In any case, if you're giving or receiving a pair of magic goggles this festive season, I'll be recommending a couple of stocking fillers to go with it at the end of this article.\r\n\n\r\nFirst though, it's time for a more general bit of stocktaking. 2022 was a big ol' shrug of a year for VR gaming. Which is not to say it was bad, plenty of fun and interesting games launched in the last twelve months, one of which I'd probably put in my personal top ten. But from both a hardware and software perspective, nothing released this year is likely to shift the needle.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Some of the most enduring songs ever produced in video games got their start on that unassuming slab of plastic and silicon.

Kerbal Space Program and Shadow Tactics - Aiko's Choice are free this week on the Epic Games Store.\nFrom now until January 12, you can hop onto the Epic store and claim both Kerbal Space Program and the standalone Shadow Tactics expansion Aiko's Choice for free. These will add the games to your library for good, so even if you're not looking to play either one right now, just claiming it puts them both in your collection for later.\nKerbal Space Program is the infamous rocket-disaster simulator about launching small, unsuspecting Kerbals into orbit with your specially designed rockets. It's a straightforward concept on paper that's made more complicated when you realize it is, actually, rocket science. Playing Kerbal is a pretty fun way to learn about how hard it is to put a metal tube in space, while also cackling when your plans go spectacularly awry.\nOtherwise, Aiko's Choice is a standalone expansion for Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun.

          "description": "EA hoping to restore 'around 40%' of affected files\nElectronic Arts has addressed a major data storage glitch that has caused untold damage to the save data of many Madden 23 players. The glitch — which struck EA servers between Wednesday, December 28 and Thursday, December 29 — has corrupted the Franchise save files of many users, essentially deleting their custom leagues entirely.\n\"Unfortunately, if you logged into franchise leagues during this time, your data was affected due to a data storage issue that resulted in franchise files being corrupted,\" said EA in a statement. \"We know how important your franchises are to you, and we are actively working on a fix to restore some files via a backup as soon as possible.\"\nHowever, EA noted that, unfortunately, many of the affected save files were beyond repair, and that, of all corrupted data, only around 40% of users would find their Franchise data salvageable. Thus, it is simply a nerve-rattling case of \"fingers crossed\" for all those affected, as they wait to see whether their custom leagues — that they have no doubt poured many, many hours into curating — have been permanently wiped.\nMore information is expected from the EA tech team next week, and users are asked to keep a close watch on the official Madden 23 Twitter. Wishing you luck if this concerns you.\nThe post Madden 23 franchise save data corrupted in server glitch appeared first on Destructoid.",

Little more was offered in the way of information, though Gran Turismo 7 owners will be able to upgrade to the PSVR2 edition of the title for free.\nNo release date was offered for the PSVR2 port of Beat Games' Beat Saber, which stands proud today as one of the most loved and recognized rhythm action titles for the modern gaming era. The colorful and exciting game is currently available on PS4 (via PSVR) and PC via HTC Vive, Oculus Quest, and Valve Index.\nPSVR 2 will launch worldwide on February 22, priced at a princely $550.

Thus, five million additional units have been purchased between September 2022 and January 2023, making it the most successful retail window for the PS5 to date. This success comes despite the console's recent price rise, which came into effect in August 2022.\nIn addition, PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan noted that the console shortage issues that troubled the PS5 in its first years of release should have all but dissipated and that nobody looking to purchase a console should have any issue in finding one available. Ryan thanked the PlayStation community for its patience in dealing with the \"unprecedented demand\" for consoles over the past two years.\nYou can watch Sony's CES 2023 press conference in the video embed below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMcjxW68Bc&ab_channel=Sony-Global\nThe post CES 2023: PlayStation 5 has surpassed 30 million sales appeared first on Destructoid.",

It somehow manages to reference all of our favorite blockbuster games while still managing to carve a path of its own -- naturally I'm excited to see a game going all out to try something new. We've gotten to see a nice lineup of trailers since Atomic Heart was announced back in 2017, and now we've got one more to add to the list. During Nvidia's CES 2023 showcase, the devs behind the game, Mundfish, let fans in on how amazing the game's ray-tracing and particle effects will look, especially in 4K.\nThis new trailer came along with an announcement that Nvidia DLSS, or deep learning super sampling, technology will be supported on 33 upcoming games, of course including Atomic Heart. The company describes DLSS as \"a revolutionary breakthrough in AI-powered graphics that massively boosts performance.\" That sounds great to me, but I'm also assuming you have to have the latest graphics cards and processors to be able to run it. Not to mention a 4K monitor and all the fixins that go along with it. I'll likely play it on the PS5, because I'm probably the least tech savvy person in all of gaming. I hope the computer whizzes out there have fun though.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ah74ys4t3Fs\nI can say with confidence that Atomic Heart is going to look incredible with top-of-the-line graphics, but I also think it's going to be a gorgeous game regardless of specs. It has such a fun, distinct art style and atmosphere, I think Mundfish will have it locked down regardless of which platform we choose to play the game on. I've certainly been let down before, but if nothing else, it's cool to see a studio putting something out that's so different from what we've seen in the past few years.

          "description": "One first party exclusive made it into the top 10\nWith 2022 fully in the rear view mirror, it's time to check in and see how the year went. For the Nintendo Switch, things were mostly good! Metacritic however has their story to tell, including a full \"top 40\" breakdown of the best-reviewed Switch games of 2022.\nNote that the criteria is fairly broad, as it involves every game from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022 that had at least seven reviews; ranked entirely by Metascore (ratings).\nThe top 10 Switch games of 2022, according to Metacritic:\nPortal Companion Collection\nPersona 5 Royal\nXenoblade Chronicles 3\nNieR: Automata - The End of YoRHa Edition\nAtari 50: The Anniversary Celebration\nNeon White\nTunic\nCuphead in the Delicious Last Course\n13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim\nThe Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe\nSeeing a first party Nintendo game in the top five is unsurprising: but it is a bit shocking that there aren't more in there. The rest of the list is filled with ports of celebrated games (Persona 5 Royal, NieR Automata), as well as timed console exclusives like Neon White (which was only on PC and Switch for roughly six months). On the flipside there's games like 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim, which only just came to Switch this year after it was exclusive to the PS4 since 2019. It's a good mix! Several sole Switch exclusives were kept off the top 10 list due to a mixed reception (mainly looking at the new Pokemon generation).\nIt just goes to show you that the Switch really has carved out a spot for itself as a port machine that people prefer; and a platform that can deliver high quality ports if the studios are up to the task. You can find the full breakdown here, including the entire top 40.\nThe post Metacritic reveals the best-reviewed Switch games of 2022 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Beyond balance patches\nHidden Variable has released the previously announced \"major update\" for the Nintendo Switch edition of cartoonish tag-fighter Skullgirls 2nd Encore. More than just a balance patch, the new update rebuilds much of the game's engine at a core level, in efforts to severely improve the Switch edition's performance.\nThe update, practically a full reinstall of the base game, features fully-rewritten code that increases the load times of the Switch port, while also tightening up online play, ensuring more stable performance, and wiping out a litany of small, troublesome bugs. Hidden Variable hopes that this new version of Skullgirls 2nd Encore will offer Nintendo players their best experience with the fighter to date.\nhttps://twitter.com/Skullgirls/status/1610366242824626179?s=20&t=zA-lXIXiJTH2K17WE8Ky3A\nIn addition, the new update brings with it the addition of the Skullgirls Season 1 Pass. Switch players can now pick up previously released season one characters — such as Annie of the Stars and Umbrella — while bringing the game up to parity with the PC and console editions in regards to balance and tournament standard features. This update has been a long time coming, and finally sees the Switch Skullgirls community rewarded for their patience.\n2023 promises to be a big year for the long-life fight franchise. The coming months will see the arrival of the sinister assassin, Black Dahlia, as well as new stages, character color palettes, webtoons, merchandise, and more. For a full report on Skullgirls' road ahead, be sure to check out our exclusive feature from last month — which includes some first-ever looks at character model sheets and animatics!\nSkullgirls 2nd Encore is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and mobile platforms.\nThe post Skullgirls 2nd Encore Switch update rebuilds the fighter at its core appeared first on Destructoid.",

The free-for-all deathmatch mode will be available to play January 5-19, and will give seven heroes on the game's roster a whole host of new god-like abilities. Some of the affected characters will include Widowmaker, who will turn enemies to stone, Junker Queen, who will call lightning down during her ultimate to do devastating damage, and Roadhog, who will turn into a giant cyclops.\nBlizzard released a trailer as part of the event's announcement, which revealed a good number of details about what we can expect from Battle for Olympus. Players will be able to earn \"divine rewards,\" and while they don't specify what that entails, it's likely to be the usual roundup of voice lines, sprays, victory poses, and hopefully the skins that we can see in the trailer, because they look sick as hell.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbI57nJsAkU\nThe epic free-for-all battles will take place on what I consider the best arcade map: Château Guillard. But the fun doesn't stop there, because after the event is over, whichever hero has secured the most eliminations throughout the event will get a marble statue of their likeness added to the control map Ilios. Looks like our favorite heroes have a chance at immortality.\nWhile Overwatch 2 hasn't exactly been my favorite game as of late, I am a sucker for Greek mythology. I'm not alone here, and Blizzard knows exactly what they're doing in getting some more players back into the game. It looks like the game's second Season is gonna be chock full of events, because even before Battle for Olympus concludes, we'll be into the Lunar New Year event that runs from January 17-February 6 this year.\n[Featured Image via Blizzard Entertainment]\nThe post Become a god in the Overwatch 2 Battle for Olympus limited time event appeared first on Destructoid.",

I'm someone who really loves to see how the sausage gets made, and having a book I can flip through from time to time and get a peek at the artistic process behind one of my favorite things is weirdly important to me. If you're a fan of Elden Ring and feel the same way, you're in for a treat, because FromSoftware has opened the pre-orders for the game's two-volume art book.\nAs the best books usually are, these volumes are both oversized hardbacks at 8.25\" x 11.75\". There's plenty of content for FromSoft to show off, because the first volume is 432 pages, and the second is 384 pages long. The former will feature art of the game's opening cinematic, as well as key art, concept art, and development design documents focused on the Lands Between, its dungeons, characters, and armor designs. The latter volume will highlight the game's enemies, items, and weapons.\n[caption id=\"attachment_356578\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1200\"] Image via FromSoftware[/caption]\nIt's looking like Amazon is the only place to pre-order the books in the western regions as of now, but there's a chance that they'll be available from other retailers once we're closer to the July 25, 2023 release date. As of now the books are also both listed for $59.99 a pop, so they'll be an investment for sure.\nFor a game as big and beautiful as Elden Ring, it would be a real shame for any of the development work to go unnoticed, because the team clearly worked hard to bring its world to life. Like I said, I love art books on principle, but I truly can't think of a property that's more deserving of one.\n[Featured Image via FromSoftware]\nThe post Official Elden Ring art books are now listed for pre-order appeared first on Destructoid.",

Skins for Mark, Omni-Man, and Atom Eve will be available for purchase in the Fall Guys store in collaboration with Skybound Games, so don't be surprised if you see some new super-friends soaring through your matches soon. Of course, Fall Guys is a family friendly game, so we won't be seeing quite as much blood and gore as we're used to from these characters.\nhttps://twitter.com/FallGuysGame/status/1610290021478580227\nAmazon Prime's acclaimed animated series Invincible is based on a comic series of the same name, written by Walking Dead comic author Robert Kirkman. Season one was a massive success when it dropped in 2021, even spawning a series of popular memes, and while we know another season is supposed to drop sometime this year, it's anyone's guess as to when we can expect it. Some fans are hoping that this Fall Guys collab means we'll be getting an update soon, and I'm certainly in that boat myself.\nFall Guys has also seen a resurgence since it went free-to-play last year, and rightfully so. I returned to the game recently after not having touched it since 2020, and it's probably even more fun than I remember due to all the new stages and content that they've added. My backlog has been keeping me plenty busy as of late, but Fall Guys is one of those games I know I'll be coming back to when my schedule clears up a bit. Certainly as a fan of the Invincible series, it'll be worth logging on to see if I can't secure some of these new skins.\n[Featured Image via Amazon]\nThe post Invincible crashes its way into Fall Guys with some new skins appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "We're off again, lil' buddy\nSkunkape Games has announced that it has begun development of Sam & Max: The Devil's Playhouse Remastered, following on from its previously released remasters of Telltale Games classics Sam & Max Save the World Remastered and Sam & Max: Beyond Time and Space Remastered. This latest retread will launch on unannounced platforms later in 2023.\nFirst released on PC and PS3 way back in 2010, The Devil's Playhouse was the third of Telltale Games' Sam & Max adventures, and sees the Freelance Police investigate a series of strange phenomena linked to the powerful psychic machinations of the mysterious \"Toys of Power\". The original release of The Devil's Playhouse sported a fresh new game engine, and allowed the player to take direct control of both Sam and Max independently — allowing for a shakeup of the title's puzzle elements and adding an extra emphasis on synergy and teamwork between the two characters.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYPuWAQvRyw&ab_channel=Skunkape\nWhile Skunkape Games has not offered any official information on the new title, we can likely expect The Devil's Playhouse Remastered to feature updated character models and environmental textures, tauter controls, and slicker U.I. integration. If we're lucky, we might also see the new release include additional artwork, voicework, and music, as was the case for both Save the World Remastered and Beyond Time and Space Remastered. We'll be sure to give you a heads-up when more information — including platforms and a release date — is forthcoming.\nSam & Max: The Devil's Playhouse Remastered is currently in development at Skunkape Games.\nThe post Sam & Max: The Devil’s Playhouse Remastered hits the road in 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

You get Gravity Circuit, a promising indie action title launching later this year. \nPlayers control Kai, a lone warrior battling an evil robotic army in a post-apocalyptic world. This side-scrolling action title boasts plenty of satisfying action thanks to Kai’s fun melee combat, nimble platforming abilities, and his signature grappling hook, which he uses to traverse levels as well as yank and toss enemies. Sporting great 16-bit art and a strong soundtrack, Gravity Circuit is worth keeping an eye on for fans of classic throwbacks. \nJoin editors Wesley LeBlanc and Marcus Stewart as they explore Gravity Circuit’s free Steam demo and discuss why it may be one of the year’s most exciting indie gems.\n\n\nFor more previews of some of the biggest games of 2022 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Fire Emblem Engage, Clive 'N' Wrench, Inkulinati, Outer Terror, and more.",

In this case, we’re replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! Join us live on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we endure two hours of nostalgic, hair-raising scares. If you can’t catch us live, each episode will be available to watch on Saturdays on the Game Informer Shows YouTube channel. \nEpisode 1 - The Harry Mason Shuffle\nEpisode 2- When Doves Cry\nEpisode 3 - Bible.\nEpisode 4 - Age Seven, Short, Black Hair\nWatch on Twitch!\nIn 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights. Protagonist Harry Mason must embark on a terrifying search for his missing daughter, Cheryl, within the eerie town of Silent Hill. What unfolds is a descent into madness that kickstarted a franchise that's (finally) returning to the limelight after years of dormancy. Join me, Marcus Stewart, along with Kyle Hilliard, as we survive Silent Hill’s debut adventure and see how its scares stack up 23 years later.\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

That story is about the GT Academy contest, which was a real contest held between 2008 and 2016 by Sony and Nissan. Winners were given entrance into Nissan's Driver Development Program, as noted by Video Games Chronicle. The film appears to be telling the tale of someone who won entrance into this program and then went on to become a real success in the racing world. \nCheck out the Gran Turismo sneak peek for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, this sneak peek is a mix of what appears to be movie footage and behind-the-scenes footage, with stars like Harbour, Barnet, and Bloom talking about their excitement for the film. \nGran Turismo hits theaters later this year on August 11. \nAlongside this sneak peek, Sony also revealed that Gran Turismo 7, the latest in the long-running series released last year, will be getting an update that makes the game playable on its upcoming PSVR2 platform. \nWhile waiting to learn more about this Gran Turismo movie, read about Project Leonardo, a new customizable accessibility controller kit PlayStation unveiled yesterday and then read about how the PlayStation 5 has surpassed 30 million units sold. \nAre you excited about this Gran Turismo movie?

One of those updates involves a closer look at the upcoming standalone multiplayer title.\nIn a blog post, Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann reflects on The Last of Us’ legacy as well as the franchise’s future. In addition to the HBO adaptation premiering on January 15 and the PC port of The Last of Us Part 1 hitting in March, Druckmann states fans will learn more about the long-awaited multiplayer experience that serves as a follow-up to the original game’s Factions mode. Druckmann writes,\n“We’ll have some fun surprises for you along the way, but later this year we will begin to offer you some details on our ambitious The Last of Us multiplayer game. With a team led by Vinit Agarwal, Joe Pettinati, and Anthony Newman, the project is shaping up to be a fresh, new experience from our studio, but one rooted in Naughty Dog’s passion for delivering incredible stories, characters, and gameplay.”\nNaughty Dog also shares a new piece of concept art, posted in full below, which is the first new material of the game since it released the first concept asset last June. It depicts two survivors heading toward a dilapidated cruise ship. \nThough we’ll be learning more about the game this year, it’s still unknown if Naughty Dog plans to launch it in 2023. That would be fitting given the anniversary, but we'll have to wait and see over the coming months. Until then, be sure to check out this feature on how The Last of Us Part 1 proves there's no such thing as a faithful remake.",

News of this change follows the release of Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance's release last year, which didn't fare too well with critics and players, amidst Larian Studios' continued development on Baldur's Gate 3 (which does not seem to be affected by this reorganization despite WotC serving as the game's publisher). \nThese two games, in part, represented WotC's bigger forray into the video game space as Bloomberg reports that the company had signed contracts with several studios to make games. WotC also \"built at least six of its own game studios,\" according to the publication. \nOne project in the works that is now canceled went under the codename \"Jabberwocky,\" according to Bloomberg, and two more externally developed games early in development are no longer moving forward as well. These cancelations and layoffs comes as parent company Hasbro's shares fell 40% last year. \nWotc told IGN that it remains \"committed to using digital games as a cornerstone of our strategy for bringing our games to players around the world,\" adding that it has \"made some changes to our long-term portfolio to focus on games which are strategically aligned with developing our existing brands and those which show promise in expanding or engaging our audience in new ways.\" \n[Source: Bloomberg]",

In addition to showing off some new gameplay clips, it announces that the game will use NVIDIA DLSS3 technology, which a press release says will \"massively boost performance.\" You can watch the trailer below.\n\n\nAnnounced by NVIDIA last September, DLSS 3 can boost a game's performance by a significant margin. One demo on NVIDIA's site shows two instances of Cyberpunk 2077 running at 96 FPS with ray tracing still enabled. \"DLSS 3 allows the seemingly impossible, high framerate without compromising the visuals,\" Adrian Chmielarz, creative director and co-founder of The Astronauts says in a press release. \"A no brainer for a game like Witchfire, which is both action and beauty.\"\nWitchfire is a dark fantasy first-person shooter from the creators of Painkiller, Bulletstorm, and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. Set in an alternate reality, players are caught in the middle of a war between witches and the Church, and must use weapons and powers from Vatican sorcerers to defeat their enemies. \nThe game is set to enter Early Access in the Epic Games Store sometime later this year, though that wasn't always the case. It was delayed last October because the team decided to overhaul the world's design and make it more open. This trailer is a good indication that the studio is still hard at work, though; here's hoping that \"early 2023\" ends up being as soon as possible.",

According to a Twitter thread posted to the official Cult of the Lamb account, this update will introduce features many players have requested, including accessibility improvements, quality-of-life features, new difficulty options, and more depth.\nThis Major Content Update will release in 2023 and be FREE to all players!\npic.twitter.com/FWFW7sC7F0\nDecember 30, 2022\nThe biggest change they showcase in this thread is the introduction of heavy attacks, which can be activated by holding down the attack button. These are more than slow swings that do more damage; in Cult of the Lamb, every heavy attack has a unique effect. For example, the sword's heavy attack smashes the ground, doing an explosion of damage that harms any enemy caught in its range. Meanwhile, the dagger creates a line of knives that fall from the sky, and the axe can be thrown around like a boomerang. This is just the tip of the iceberg; developer Massive Monster says it's \"just one small tidbit\" of what's still to come.\nThe update should come soon, but not that soon. The last tweet of the thread clarifies that the developers are currently working on a patch to fix some console bugs and that the major update won't be released until after that. Their release window also isn't any more specific than \"2023,\" so it could come out any time this year.\nIf you're interested in learning more about the game, you can check out our review.\nWould a major update bring you back for more Cult of the Lamb?

Current Hitman 3 owners will get a free upgrade to Hitman World of Assassination on all platforms.\"\n\"We're drastically simplifying the purchase experience for new players. Hitman World of Assassination will be the single experience option to start playing.\" \n\n\nThis update makes it so that all Hitman 3 owners will have the same base content ownership, and it attempts to eliminate confusion over which edition to buy to obtain certain levels by making it so that there is only one purchase option. The other DLC will apparently still be available for purchase, but owning all the IO Interactive Hitman trilogy levels will be easier than ever now. \nHitman World of Assassination will cost $70, and it includes Hitman 3, the Hitman 1 Game of the Year Access Pass, and the Hitman 2 Standard Access Pass. You can also purchase the Hitman World of Assassination Deluxe Pack for $30 to get the Hitman 3 Deluxe Pack, the Hitman 3 Seven Deadly Sins Collection, and the Hitman 2 Expansion Access Pass. \n\"Those are the only two products that new players need to consider when buying any Hitman game digitially as of January 26, 2023,\" IO writes in a blog post. \"The changes have also been made with the Freelancer game mode in mind, where being able to easily access all locations from across the World of Assassination is parmount to maximizing your enjoyment.\" \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's Hitman 3 review and then read about the new Hitman 3 Freelancer mode.\nHave you played this Hitman trilogy?

The user didn't provide many details about the potential special edition Switch, but as you can see in the images below, the photos are quite believable.

However, elaborate and well-done fakes have been done before so there's no telling if this is actually real until we learn more information.

Longtime MGS producer Noriaki Okamura wrote in a recent issue of Famitsu that \"2023 will be a year of many announcements,\" as reported by Gematsu. \nIn this special end-of-the-year issue of Famitsu, multiple Japanese developers and producers wrote quick teases about what 2023 might hold for them. It's here where Okamura teased that 2023 will be a year of announcements for Konami Digital Entertainment. More specifically, he said \"Other than [the educational edition of Momotaro Dentetsu announced last year], 2023 will be a year of many announcements,\" and that his keyword for 2023 is \"long-awaited,\" as noted by Gematsu. \nNow, this could just be his way of saying that Konami, as a whole, will make some announcements and that maybe some of them will be long-awaited by fans. However, given that it's Okamura – a longtime MGS producer – saying this, there's reason to believe that maybe he's teasing a return to the MGS series. Perhaps we're getting a remake of one of the games, or maybe a new mainline entry. Only time will tell. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's ranking of the Metal Gear Solid series. \n[Source: Gematsu]\nHow do you want to see the Metal Gear Solid series return?

The narrative-driven shooter is set in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone in a post-apocalyptic world laden with dangerous mutated monsters. Players must fight their way to the heart of the zone while steering the non-linear plot through choice-driven gameplay. \n\n\nFormally confirmed in 2020 after years of start and stop announcements, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 has had a tumultuous development. After announcing and quickly canceling NFT plans due to fan backlash in December 2021, the project came to a screeching halt in February due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, where GSC is based. Many employees were forced to evacuate their homes in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital. Other designers chose to defend the city. One of GSC’s designers who volunteered to fight, Vladimir \"Fresh\" Yezhov, was recently killed in combat. \nS.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl is slated to arrive on Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass) and PC in 2023.

Thanks to the team’s persistence, post-launch roadmap, and an injection of new blood into the project's leadership, Street Fighter V drastically improved its core gameplay, online play, content offerings, and more throughout its six-year lifespan.\nWith the benefit of those lessons learned, many team members that righted the ship are back to develop Street Fighter 6.

          "description": "Mortal Kombat was not supposed to die. Many regard Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe as one of the lowest points of the series. Its minigame-centric fights and awkward movement were damning, but it also lacked the silly, over-the-top violence Mortal Kombat is known for – a sad reality for appeasing license holder Warner Bros. Batman can cripple impoverished criminals, but he can’t be cut in half by Tarkatan blades.\nIt would have been disappointing to end on an ill-fated crossover, but Midway’s untimely demise could have made that so. Layoffs, uncertainty, and publisher implosion aren’t how franchises live; it’s how they die. But the then-newly formed NetherRealm Studios reinvigorated the entire franchise after its darkest period with one of its most beloved entries: the 2011 reboot, Mortal Kombat 9. Read more...",

I have vague memories of seeing a TV commercial for the original PlayStation game when I was young and remember playing the game’s first few hours in a friend’s attic between Mat Hoffman’s Pro BMX sessions. It wasn’t until much later, when I found an inexpensive green label copy at a Circuit City, that I gave it another shot, but, again, I only made it through the first few hours. When Square Enix released it in such a way that I could play it on my PlayStation 3 and move it over to my PSP, I made it the furthest. I left Midgar, saved my game, and turned off my PSP, fully lying to myself that I would pick it back up again soon. That was more than 10 years ago.\nAll of that is to say my understanding of the world of Final Fantasy VII i…",

          "description": "If you walked into an arcade in the 1990s, it undoubtedly had a Street Fighter II cabinet. If you went at the right time, you probably even saw a crowd gathered around it. As one of the most profitable games in arcade history, Street Fighter II drew more than its fair share of quarters and tokens during the arcade heyday. But the franchise transcends that one moment in time. To say that Street Fighter has sparked multiple revolutions in its genre throughout its history is not far-fetched.\nArcades aren’t omnipresent the way they once were, but the Street Fighter name has endured the ever-shifting grounds of the games industry. The fierce fistfights made the leap from mall game rooms to the living room, the internet, and even tournaments broadcast to massive, international audiences. As the franchise turns 35 years old, we met with the people involved to understand the series’ origins and how it remains relevant three-and-a-half decades later. Read more...",

The most recent (and significant) roadblock comes from the American Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which filed a lawsuit a few weeks ago to prevent the deal from going through. Now, Microsoft has fired back with a response, saying the FTC is violating their fifth amendment rights to due process. \nThe full document (which you can read here) claims that the deal should be allowed to go through for several other reasons as well, stating that Xbox and Activision Blizzard are “just two of hundreds of game publishers.” The claims that the FTC violates the constitution are listed on page 34 and are just a handful of defenses against the lawsuit in a list of two dozen. \nWhile the basis of the FTC’s lawsuit is …",

Brothers Chad and Jared Moldenhauer worked for years, risking their finances founding Studio MDHR and hiring a host of talented artists and animators to bring their tough-as-nails run ‘n’ gun game to life. The gamble paid off in spades. Inspired by both 1930s animation and classic games like Contra and Gunstar Heroes, Cuphead has sold more than six million copies, amassing critical acclaim, legions of fans, a TV show, and multiple world records along the way.\nWith Cuphead’s staggering success, it’s not too surprising the team at MDHR wanted to deliver one more serving of sharp shooting excitement and aggravation. Opting for DLC as opposed to a full-on sequel, the Cuphead developer set about outlining The Delicious Last Course, released in June 2022. Early in production, MDHR decided that a boss concept from the original game, one scrapped due to time constraints, would be the perfect starting point for this newest outing. Read more...",

Players first experiencing the game through the remake will understand the plot in much the same way. They follow the same story to the same conclusion, meeting the same characters and feeling many of the same feelings. They experience the same vision of a post-apocalyptic United States, where one traumatized man, Joel, reckons with his inability to part with his surrogate daughter, Ellie.\nBut even a remake sticking as close to the original script and general design of its original as Part I is, ultimately, a new game in its own right.

Series creator Yoko Taro is also involved with the project. \nThe series is in production at A-1 Pictures, a subsidiary of Aniplex. In the past, the production house has worked on series such as Black Butler, Your Lie in April, Fate, and Sword Art Online. Ver1.1a is being directed by Ryoji Masuyama, who's previously worked on KILL la KILL, Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance and Evangelion: 3.0+1.01 Thrice Upon a Time, as well as Gurren Lagann.\nNieR:Automata Ver1.1a will begin airing in Japan on January 7, 2023.

Evath's moon Mitral has turned into a gigantic gas time bomb. A meteor is also due to impact Mitral in the next several hours. You were chosen to secure each of Mitral's 18 sectors by positioning a drilling rig over the gas pockets in each sector before the meteor strikes.\nSolve challenging riddles by relying on geological clues, intuition, or good old trial and error. To survive your mission, find Rubicon crystals to restore energy and destroy (or avoid) the Laser Beacons and Skanners left behind by the Ketars. Good luck!\nOur reimplemented engine features graphics using software (TinyGL) or hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Driller support is limited to DOS (EGA mode), Amiga and AtariST releases, but we hope to be able to add more soon! Please contact us if you have some other release.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build.
