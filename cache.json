Before long a plethora of hugely successful cross-media crossovers appeared: the One Piece: Pirate Warriors series has four entries at the time of writing (two on Switch), and Nintendo-wise we've seen two Zelda-based Hyrule Warriors games and a brilliant Fire Emblem too, with a sequel — Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes — due on 24th June.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Directed by Koichiro Ito (scenario designer for Metal Gear Solid V) and produced by Junichi Ehara (NieR: Automata) at Square Enix, it somehow slipped our notice for a while like a clever killer skulking about in the night, but we’re ecstatic to have finally caught this culprit.\nThe Centennial Case revolves around Haruka Kagami, a mystery novel writer, and Eiji Shijima, a scientist studying the cellular ageing process. After a skeleton is unearthed at Eiji’s ancestral home, he asks Haruka to travel with him to investigate the mysteries that surround his family, while he himself searches for a fruit passed down in his family that can halt the ageing process.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Well, not really — companies adjust video game character models pretty often, usually between console generations or as graphics engines improve. But people can get pretty protective of particular character models. Some people prefer Sonic's sprite in Sonic the Hedgehog 3 & Knuckles as it's a little pointier and has smaller eyes, and Pikachu started shedding weight between Pokémon Red & Blue and Pokémon Gold & Silver.\nSo, with this in mind, we have a question for Nintendo — why do you keep making Pauline shorter?\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Brain reaction.\nRecently, I was talking to my partner about my all-time favourite niche genre of games. He's a game developer, so we have these kinds of discussions a lot, usually trying to nail down what it is we like best about a particular game, or scene, or genre — but this time, we were trying to find out exactly what the genre even was.\nNow, I have a particular bugbear when it comes to game genres, which is that they're all pretty stupid. They're not helpful for casual consumers (who often don't know what things like \"roguelike\" are) and they're largely descriptive of the actions one takes or responds to (\"shooter\", \"platformer\") rather than the tone or feeling of a game. I mean, these genres can be useful, like, for example, if you're making really cool lists of games and you need some kind of unifying feature so you can let people know where to find what they're looking for, but otherwise, game genres are weirdly unhelpful, mechanical, and self-referential.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

We gawked at the coolest booths on the show floor. I got nightmares after looking at a super cursed baby. My personal highlight, though, was talking to the Pinny Arcade collectors during the show's official trading event.\r\n\n\r\nI’ll admit, before I went to PAX I didn’t really appreciate how big Pinny Arcade was. I’d definitely seen photos of colourful metal pins depicting characters from various video games fly across my screen as I browsed Twitter, but I had never thought much about them beyond that. I was shocked, then, to arrive at PAX and realise just how integral this collectable is to the show. Merch booths sell starter packs, individual demo stations flog game specific rarities and avid fans adorn their lanyards with their favourite pieces. It turns out, Pinny Arcade is huge. \r\n\n \nRead more",

This is all by way of introduction to Eternal Threads, a puzzle game where you go back in time to stop everyone in a house share dying in a fire. \nTo save a present that has been rendered apocalyptic by time travel itself, you are part of a team who go back and change tiny things in the past to fix it, in this case 2015. While it is imperative for some reason that the fire does indeed happen, it is just as important that all six occupants live. You can alter small decisions they make in the week running up to the fire, and so save their lives by choosing whether they go to the pub, if they comfort each other in times of need, or what they have arguments about.

With its late summer release fast approaching, Volition recently showed off a larger chunk of some actual gameplay to press in another remote preview session. It looks almost exactly like what you'd expect it to look like: a fun open world game where you shoot people and smash cars into other cars.\nBarring any catastrophic eventualities where this game actually ends up being just a load of bugs propping up other bugs in a fluorescent trenchcoat, I feel almost 100% confident in saying to you that this will be an enjoyable product when it comes out. But I also should be honest and say that the gameplay I saw has congealed into the same kind of sticky morass and blurred whirling lights in my memory as my first all-night benders. It's a big collage of colours and explosions, and words like \"cops\", \"switch car\" and \"plan\", leaving a general impression of fun but, so far, few specifics in its wake. And to be even more frank about it all, I can't think of a nailed on reason why any of it has to be a Saints Row game.\nRead more",

Its 15.6 screen, powered by an RTX 3080 and Intel Core i9-12900H CPU, promises both standard 2D at 4K and glasses-free stereoscopic 3D-o-vision. A bit like the Nintendo 3DS, only much more powerful, higher-res, and costing $3400 / €3299.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "From the 90s onwards, movies taught me that vampires spend all their time eating and having sex with people (often concurrently). Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong has taught me that they actually spend most of their time walking around looking at things, sometimes stopping to have tense conversations or pick up keycards. There is occasional eating.\nThis is probably because the three vampires you play as in Swansong aren't exactly on their down-time. Set in Boston in 2019, you begin in medias res after a sudden violent attack on a party has left the Boston vampire court reeling. The Prince, an Annie Lennox cosplayer called Hazel Iverson, has called three of her most trusted lieutenants in to firstly check on the immediate aftermath, and thereafter investigate the wider fallout and strike against whodunnit. Since developers Big Bad Wolf are the folks behind The Council, the role you take isn't an action hero but different shades of spy and/or detective. Neither leaves you much time to loaf about being all sexy, though. \nRead more",

It showed Eve Online’s learning curve as a comedy cliff face, so steep that it turned back on itself. Stickmen tumbled from its peak, while others were crucified or hanged from the curve’s mantel - killed by Eve’s notoriously cruel new player experience. It earned a laugh of grim recognition from the audience, all survivors of that terrible climb.\nRead more",

The news came as part of Mediatonic’s announcement that Fall Guys is coming to Nintendo Switch and Xbox next month with full cross-play and cross-progression support, alongside its current homes on PC and PlayStation.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I cannot remember any of the rules of poker, but I do really like the feel of cards, the shick schick shick of shuffling them and all the business of moving them around in your hand as if that'll change things very much. Card Shark, the latest game from the Reigns devs Nerial, is an ideal card game for me, as it does all the noises of shuffling and dealing and collecting cards extremely well, without requiring any knowledge or memory of the games its punters are actually playing. \nInstead, Card Shark is all about the palming and stacking and counting of cards, rather than an actual card game like your classic deckbuilders and such like. It will be out in full on June 2nd, but last week I got to play a larger version of the current Steam demo - about four hours worth of it, in fact - and I discovered that while I'm very bad at card games, I am pretty good at (pretend) cheating at them.\nRead more",

          "description": "AMD’s FSR 2.0 upscaler is out now – in only one game, Deathloop, but still. This is a big moment for the heavily upgraded FSR (FidelityFX Super Resolution), as it’s basically attempting to fight Nvidia’s rival DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) with some of its own tactics. There’s none of Nvidia’s machine learning enhancements, but whereas FSR 1.0 was a simple spatial upscaler – meaning data used for upscaling a frame could only come from within the frame itself – FSR 2.0 uses a temporal upscaling technique similar to that of DLSS. This allows it to draw data from previous frames as well, producing a sharper, higher-quality image. \r\n\n\r\nThe lack of machine learning also has the upside of keeping FSR 2.0, like FSR 1.0, compatible with any reasonably recent gaming GPU. Nvidia may make most of this generation’s best graphics cards, but you won't need something brand new and super powerful to let FSR 2.0 boost your frame rates. To find out how well it works, compared to both DLSS and FSR 1.0, I reinstalled Deathloop and gave all three upscalers a whirl.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The latest one I've finally made some time for is Ignited Steel Colon Mech Tactics, a turn-based tactical game with a light sprinkling of FTL.\nDespite appearances, it's quite mildly roguelike, and those of you who dig a complex strategic challenge or skin of your teeth type survival story aren't quite the right audience. This one is a more forgiving affair, and yet not easy or simply enough that I ever got bored. It's a good time.\nRead more",

          "description": "The Lego games I'm most familiar with are the licensed property games - yer Lego Indiana Joneses and yer Lego Star Warses where you run around a continuous level smashing things. Lego Bricktales is more akin to last year's extremely cute geometric puzzler Lego Builder's Journey, in that you're exploring detailed, colourful brick dioramas, and solving puzzles by bulding things out of titular hot-property block. In Bricktales, though, it's way more granular. You're whisked away into a separate building screen to construct and stress test things like bridges and beams to support a platform, for example. You have a set number of different shaped and sized bricks to work with.\nFrom playing a preview build of the first level - a jungle, home to some lost explorers - the thing that impresses me most about Bricktales is just how much it's like building things with actual Lego. It sounds stupid to say, but them little bricks are really astonishingly realised. It all looks so much Lego it's sort of surprising that you can't reach through the screen and pick it up. It's amazing. It's the closest thing to Lego you can get outside of actual Lego - which is the problem. It just kind of makes you miss Lego.\nRead more",

This towel is inspired by Spocco Square from the Nintendo Switch Sports game. Handy for keeping your head in the game, wicking away sweat, or cooling off during your next match or workout!\"\n\nThe lead time from an announcement to a release for a My Nintendo reward varies, but generally it can be anywhere from one to three weeks until it's up for sale. Expect it to arrive in mid-May at the latest, most likely. Based on prior reward structures, it'll probably be around 500 Platinum or more: but the Japanese Switch Sports towel reward (which is a different design) is 400.\nAs a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.\nThere's free shipping on orders of $50 or more, and you can bundle cash products with the Platinum rewards if you want. You can also buy multiple My Nintendo rewards with Platinum and pay one flat rate shipping fee.\nThe post The next My Nintendo reward is a Switch Sports cooling towel (Update) appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's a brilliant idea for a first-gen Pokemon Red/Blue/Green remake from artist @pokeyugami.\nI'd be writing this article if the source was just an image, but it's a full-blown video:\nhttps://twitter.com/pokeyugami/status/1527576053014618112\nIn the clip (via The Escapist), Red strolls through the forest as a few Caterpie and Weedle scooch by while a Bug Catcher boy stands guard, ready to show off his beauties.\nOn Twitter, a fan tacked on the Viridian Forest music for the full classic effect.\nNot to tear down some of the official Pokemon remakes we've gotten over the years (most recently the chibi-ified Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl on Nintendo Switch last year), but dang. This fan art is so wonderful. It's how adults like me imagined Pokemon as a kid.\n[caption id=\"attachment_323124\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1920\"] The original Pokemon fantasy.[/caption]\nIf you're on board, you should also check out some of @pokeyugami's other work on Twitter. I love this generation-spanning Gym Leader illustration, as well as this Professor piece. Their art combines the old with the new in a novel way.\nWhat are the odds?\nJust the other day I was thinking about another similar fan project — a custom Gengar plush with Sugimori-esque painterly detailing. There's a growing passion for this stuff among creators, and a riled-up audience of fans all ready to go, cash in hand.\nWith the power of nostalgia and the way trends seem to circle back around, I feel like it's only a matter of time before a real Pokemon game taps into this watercolor vibe.\nWhat is it with me getting my hopes up as a once-die-hard Pokemon fan?

The retro enthusiasts over at Hamster have taken time out from the Namco party to offer up one of the most infamous oddities of the classic arcade era. Straight out of Data East and into your hearts, it's Trio the Punch: Never Forget Me, now available on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.\nReleased in arcades in the spring of 1990, Trio the Punch: Never Forget Me is a delectably daft crossover beat-'em-up that stars characters from Data East's catalog, as well as some familiar, non-sequitur stages and even some iconic works of art. Players guide one of three heroes through incredibly strange side-scrolling action — fighting cities full of ninjas, monsters in the rainforest, giant robo-guardians, stacks of animals, and even the fire-breathing Data East veteran, Karnov. This is not to make mention of the moped-riding zombies, disembodied unicorn heads, or the player's enviable final form of... a sheep.\nCheck out the wacky antics in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber World of Longplays.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIPtzZHJnkg\nWhile Trio the Punch is hardly the most playable or enjoyable of classic side-scrolling actioners, the title has long cemented its place in video gaming history simply due to its nigh-on incomprehensible nature. The game does not offer any insight whatsoever in regards to plot or reason, and most on-screen text is just poorly translated (or simply garbled) gibberish. It's just a whole lot of nonsense, charmingly released as the arcade market truly started to find its feet with polished, well-produced, sensical video games. Among its contemporaries, Trio the Punch was batshit anarchy, and for that, it will remain curio in the video game hall of fame.\nTrio the Punch: Never Forget Me is available to download now on PS4 and Switch, priced at $8.\nThe post The legendarily odd Trio the Punch: Never Forget Me joins the Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Yet another cozy game to look forward to\nThe games industry is flooding with cozy, impossibly cute life simulators right now, and as a massive fan of the genre, I personally could not be happier. Titles like Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing have left an obvious mark on the market, proving time and time again that gamers are craving a simpler, sweeter life. Next up in the long list of simulators is Little Witch in the Woods, and it's looking like a real contender to stand out among the competition and be one of my favorite games of recent memory.\nLittle Witch in the Woods may have just entered early access, but it's already been garnering a lot of attention on Steam and Xbox (it's also playable with Game Pass).\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lS9QHk2A6yg\nPlayers take on the role of Ellie, a young witch who takes it upon herself to collect items in the forest and help out her neighbors. Ellie also teams up with a sentient witch hat named Virgil, and works to hone her craft as an apprentice witch, an element reminiscent of Kiki's Delivery Service (which is unsurprisingly one of my favorite movies, go figure).\nEarly reviews say it's very similar to Stardew by way of gameplay, just with a witchy theme about it, and there's not much else you could say that would make me want to play this game more.\nThe developer of Little Witch in the Woods, Sunny Side Up, is reportedly very pleased with the response to the game so far, and are continued to update players. They say that the plan is for the game to get a full launch in 2023, and to add two more story chapters and an ending in addition to the prologue and first chapter that are currently available to play.\nIt sounds like they have a lot more game to make, but knowing that fans are already falling in love with the project so far has to be an amazing motivator. Godspeed, Sunny Side Up — we can't wait to see what else you have in store for us.\nThe post Adorably arcane life sim Little Witch in the Woods is in early access appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Regal Replica\nOne of the contributing factors to the enduring appeal of Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild lies in its introduction of many mythical new characters to the Zelda universe. And for those of you besotted with the underwater kingdom of Zora, First 4 Figures might have a treat in store for you.\nThe merch-maker has offered a first look at a brand new figurine capturing the beautiful form of Zoran princess and Champion of Hyrule, Mipha. The PVC figurine stands roughly nine inches in height and is delicately poised with her formidable Lightscale Trident. Mipha's ethereal presence and compelling beauty belie her adept combat skills and overwhelmingly courageous nature, reflected in her subtle stance.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGeIxpNMoMo&t\nMipha stands atop a sturdy circular base, emblazoned with the symbol of the secretive \"Shadow People,\" The Sheikah. The base features LED lighting effects, which light up her royal highness with a delectable aqua blue glow. The Mipha figurine will look mighty fine standing on anyone's bookshelf, and will make an even better accompaniment to F4F's previous releases of Princess Zelda, Revali, and, of course, Link himself.\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Mipha figurine is available to pre-order now from the official First 4 Figures website. Mipha will retail for around $150 USD on release, but those who pre-order now can bag an Early Bird price of $137.99, not including shipping or any potential customs charges. Mipha is expected to ship in the fourth quarter of 2022 and payment options are also available.\nThe post The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild’s Mipha is getting her own figurine appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It's an arrr-PG\nBandai Namco is showing a bit more of the battle side of its upcoming One Piece Odyssey. The role-playing game based on hit manga One Piece is launching sometime this year, and it certainly has some RPG systems in place.\nWhen the new One Piece game was first revealed, it definitely had some RPG vibes. Some new screenshots from the Japanese One Piece Odyssey site (as spotted by RPG Site) really emphasize just how it's tackling battles, though.\n\nThere's HP and TP, as well as a weapon triangle of sorts. There are definitely some Persona vibes to the UI elements here, and I think they actually work pretty well.\n\nAnother screenshot, shown above, also highlights some positioning mechanics. It looks like range and position on the field will be important too.\nOther screenshots show different members of the Straw Hat Pirates using their various abilities to navigate the environment. From slicing a gate in half to seemingly flying across the map, it looks like overworld traversal mechanics will play a role too.\n\nStraw hat life\nI am, admittedly, not a huge follower of One Piece. I've dug other Shonen Jump series like Jujutsu Kaisen and My Hero Academia, but never taken the dive on One Piece, due in large part to just how lengthy it is. My backlog is already gigantic.\nThat said, these screenshots are making a pretty good case for checking out One Piece Odyssey. While anime spinoffs usually veer into fighting games or other action-oriented formats, RPGs are relatively unexplored territory. Bandai Namco seems to really be going for a full-on RPG with One Piece Odyssey though, with screenshots more evocative of Persona and the Atelier series.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yogS2oJ2pZI\nNo firm date's been set yet, but One Piece Odyssey is due out sometime this year for PC, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, and PS5.\nThe post New One Piece Odyssey screenshots show off its RPG battles appeared first on Destructoid.",

We were talking about Good Smile Company's figure for Aloy (of Horizon Zero Dawn and Forbidden West fame) just a few days ago. And now here's the humble little bot, looking like a champ. When's the next game? There's got to be another one.\nhttps://twitter.com/GoodSmile_US/status/1527487300283801610\nGood Smile Company is taking pre-orders, and you'll have until June 29 to partake. The Astro Nendoroid costs $63.99, and it's aiming to ship in February 2023, but as Siliconera points out, these things have a tendency to slip. You'll need some patience either way.\nAside from the default face, Astro also comes with swappable \"dizzy\" and \"smiling\" expressions, as well as accessories: a fuse, a PlayStation coin, and laser feet.\nI love this design as is, and it's a natural fit for the Nendoroid line, but one thing is missing. Imagine if they recreated some of the collectible PlayStation console \"artifacts\" from Astro's Playroom. The pack-in PS5 game was such a nostalgic, nod-filled collect-a-thon.\nThe Astro Bot figure is so cute and pure, I feel guilty for neglecting Astro's Playroom — a game I got all of the trophies for but admittedly haven't thought about much since the PS5 launched. I should download that again (you can never have enough free space...) and try to improve some of my times.

Bandai Namco is preparing for the release of the remastered Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series on PC and consoles, and has dropped a short, nostalgia-sparking clip from the retro adventures.\nAs previously reported, Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series is a compendium containing remasters of the 2008 Wii release Klonoa: Door to Phantomile (itself a remake of the 1997 PlayStation original) and the 2001 PS2 sequel Klonoa: Lunatea’s Veil. Developed by Monkeycraft, the two games have been lovingly restored with sharp HD visuals, 60 FPS gameplay, and boosted with new features, including rebalanced difficulty options and an all-new two-player co-op mode.\n2022 sees Klonoa celebrate their 25thn birthday, so now is the perfect time to release this delightful looking retrospective of their most memorable adventures. Sadly, the compendium will not contain all of the Klonoa titles — so you won't find their Game Boy Advance or Wonderswan adventures herein — but it will at least be fun to visit the charming world of Lunatea, looking fresher and more colorful than ever before.\nKlonoa is one of a number of somewhat forgotten gaming heroes making a grand comeback, so it's a pretty rad time to be a fan of classic platforming adventures. Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series launches July 8 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.\nhttps://twitter.com/BandaiNamcoEU/status/1526956304140587009?s=20&t=5d04ZoEat3YvwIRds0YKWQ\nThe post Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series hits July, and here’s a small snippet appeared first on Destructoid.",

First up is the stunning F/A-18E Super Hornet, as flown by Top Gun's white-teethed, cheesy-grinnin' hero Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, portrayed in the movie series by alien daredevil Tom Cruise. Oh, and for those of you who truly want to take it right-in-to-the danger zone, then it seems that a replica of Maverick and Goose's F-14A Tomcat from the 1986 movie is also included.\nThe trailer below spotlights the F/A-18E Super Hornet, as well as the movie's fret-wanking theme.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7ujkyWqbfo\nReleased way back in 2019, which today feels a whole world away, Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown was a hit with the dedicated Ace Combat community, who celebrated its snazzy visuals, frenetic gameplay, and surprisingly deep lore. The initial release would be followed by a slew of extra missions and aircraft updates. While the game is certainly in its twilight years today, this Top Gun: Maverick crossover is an absolute no-brainer, and will be likely very welcome among the game's long-time community of players.\nAce Combat 7: Skies Unknown is available now on PS4, PC, and Xbox One. Top Gun: Maverick premieres in theaters May 27 and is, apparently, an excellent sequel, with some reviewers going as far as to say that it surpasses the original.

In a new statement (as noted by Eurogamer), the industry giant announced that it would be bringing its \"Road to Zero\" green efficiency plan forward, with an aim of severely reducing its carbon footprint within the coming decades.\nSony is looking to achieve its ambitious renewable energy goals by revising the power input and output of its global network of offices and production plants. The PlayStation publisher will be looking to install solar panels at its various international locations, whilst exploring other energy-saving measures. The company hopes to have increased its renewable energy usage to 35% by 2025, and 100% by 2030.\nIn addition, Sony hopes to be fully carbon neutral by 2040, while also ensuring that its wide variety of home entertainment products also produce less planet-harming emissions and run as energy-efficiently as possible.

          "description": "Get in The Lab\nAfter a nigh-on 18-month hype period, Nexon is finally preparing to unleash its good-looking fighter DNF Duel upon the world. As we edge ever closer to its June 28 launch date, the publisher is spittin' out new trailers left, right, and center — even affording the fighter's Practice Mode its own spotlight!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMmd77abac0\nThe trailer offers us a glimpse of DNF Duel's Training and Tutorial modes, which hope to get newcomers up and running while helping veteran fighting game players adapt to DNF Duel's flow and mechanics.\nWe can see from the video that the Training Mode is packed out with all of the requisite options, including gauge management, record/playback functions, character stances, wake-up practice, and much more. In addition, the tutorial offers playable trials teaching players basic movement all the way up to performing DNF Duel's attractive and dynamic Supers.\nAn adaptation of Korean MMO Dungeon Fighter Online, DNF Duel is developed by fighting game veterans Eighting and Arc System Works, which automatically lend the new title a solid sense of quality and legitimacy. It will be an uphill battle for the plucky upstart to find its name among the Tekkens and Street Fighters of the scene, but it's looking like a pretty slick scrapper, and I'm excited to check out the final product.\nDNF Duel launches June 28 on PlayStation and PC platforms. Be sure to check out the previous trailers introducing us to characters for Berserker, Grappler, Hitman, Inquisitor, Striker, Ranger, Dragon Knight, Vanguard, Kunoichi, Crusader, and Ghostblade.\nThe post DNF Duel’s Practice Mode apparently deserves its own trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

Norman Reedus, star of The Walking Dead TV series who played Sam \"Porter\" Bridges in Death Stranding, seems to have just confirmed a part two in a new interview.\nIn an interview with LeoEdit (spotted by GamerUP), Reedus is asked about filming for the Death Stranding video game. To which he responds, \"We just started the second one.\"\nIn a follow-up question, Reedus tells the story of how he and Hideo Kojima met through mutual friend Guillermo Del Toro. He describes seeing an early version of Kojima's Silent Hill project. Reedus committed and well, the rest is long, fraught video game history.\n\"It took me maybe two or three years to finish all the MoCap sessions and everything,\" said Reedus. \"It takes a lot of work. And then the game came out, and it just won all these awards, and it was a huge thing, so we just started part two of that.\"\nWell, that certainly reads like two confirmations of a new Death Stranding.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlLEmu8c-Vk\nBridging the gap\nKojima has teased a bit about his next project in the past. In June 2020, he posted some images of his workspace as he worked on a new title with Yoji Shinkawa, one of his longtime collaborators. Fans at the time even spotted the word \"Bridges\" on some concept art.\nBut Kojima has also been rumored to up to several different projects. A report indicated he was working with Microsoft for an Xbox game. And he also told Famitsu that his next project is a big title that is a \"new challenge.\"\nDeath Stranding did get a Director's Cut last year, adding new content and tools for Sam to make the journey across America. We haven't had any indication of a sequel until now though. But according to Norman Reedus, I guess we can look forward to a possible new Death Stranding.\nThe post Norman Reedus says there’s a second Death Stranding on the way appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The old waiting game...\nSquare Enix has splurged out on a selection of mysterious trademarks, recently filed in Japan and seemingly related to its iconic RPG title Final Fantasy VII Remake as well as multiple unknown IPS.\nThe first of the three trademarks, as noted by Gematsu, is for Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade. A title that is already available on PS5 and PC via Epic Games Store. The trademark could suggest that a re-release is being prepared, perhaps for the PC via the Steam Store or for another platform entirely.\nThe other two trademarks are a total mystery, and see the publisher lay claim to \"Final Bar Line\" and \"Labyrinth Striker.\" Interestingly, both titles sound like they'd be more fitting as subtitles than actual game names, which has led some to theorize that they may represent spin-offs from some of Square's franchises, such as Kingdom Hearts, Bravely Default, Dragon Quest, Octopath Traveler, or, of course, Final Fantasy itself.\nFor now, it all remains little more than speculation. But, with another summer of gaming reveals up ahead, it will be interesting to see if any of these new names will be coming into play in the latter half of 2022.\nThe post Square Enix files mystery Final Fantasy VII, Labyrinth Striker, and Final Bar Line trademarks appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Player Toxicity Expected\nFuncom has released a new trailer for its upcoming doomsday shooter Metal: Hellsinger — the new video features the unmistakable vocals of Serj Tankian, long-time frontman of metal band System of a Down. Tankian joins a roster of metal legends that will soundtrack the next-gen shooter's violent chaos.\n\"What can you even say! We have so many System of a Down fans in the studio, adding Serj Tankian to our already incredible roster of vocalists feels unreal,\" said David Goldfarb of developer The Outsiders. \"He completely killed the track and made it his own in a way only Serj could. We are so excited and can’t wait to see everyone playing!\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vig4_lsrpto\nAs FPS fans will immediately note, Metal: Hellsinger features the typically apocalyptic vibe of the genre's roots, founded in titles such as Doom, Hexen, Quake, and Heretic. In a fun new twist on the classic first-person gameplay, however, players will be rewarded for their ability to run 'n' gun to the beat of the game's bass-pounding score, chaining together combos and meaty acts of destruction in time with the music — a gimmick similarly explored to solid effect in 2021 release BPM: Bullets per Minute.\nTankian joins a horn-throwing roster of composers that already includes Arch Enemy's Alissa White-Gluz, Trivium's Matt Heafy, and the dulcet tones of Lamb of God's Randy Blythe. More artists are expected to be announced in the near future. It feels as though Mike Patton should most definitely be here, but the Faith No More/Fantomas frontman is currently taking a well-earned sabbatical from work, so that may just be wishful thinking on my part.\nMetal: Hellsinger is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.\nThe post SOAD’s Serj Tankian joins metal legends to score Metal: Hellsinger appeared first on Destructoid.",

We're doing things differently this time as we're discussing the gameography of a developer rather than covering an individual game series. That studio is Supergiant Games, the acclaimed indie developer of Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, and Hades. This week, we conclude our season by analyzing 2020's Hades. \nUnlike Supergiant Games' previous titles, Hades had two release dates. Its first release came on December 6, 2018 when it launched in early access on PC, while the full game was available to be played on September 17, 2020. Hades takes everything the studio has learned up to this point and blends them into an ambitious rogue-lite that's developed in a way the team has never experienced before: with the gaming public playing the game as it's being made. Check out this episode to learn the backstory of how Pyre's large cast of characters inspired the evolving narrative of Zagreus and his dysfunctional diety family, how the studio fared developing an early access game, and learn all about Greek mythology from our guest, the incomparable Jill Grodt.\nJoin hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), along with Game Informer associate editor Jill Grodt (@Finruin) for a verbal stroll through the history and narrative of Hades!\nIf you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

In it, Chip and Dale deal with the realities of staying relevant in an industry that has changed significantly over the course of multiple decades. In one scene at a fan convention, the Rangers run into a familiar face that we never thought we'd actually see in a finished film, Ugly Sonic.\nThat's right, the version of Sonic the Hedgehog that caused the 2020 film to be delayed and re-modeled makes his triumphant return in Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers.

Join us for another special episode of The GI Show, where we're reviewing both episode nine of Halo and season one as a whole.\n\n\nThe regular team is back to wrap up the season, but we couldn't do a Halo review without a familiar friend. Alex Stadnik, Brian Shea, and Andrew Reiner are joined by Kate Sánchez, founder of But Why Tho? to break down the highs and lows of this episode and the season in this spoiler-filled discussion.\nIn episode nine, we find John and company reeling from the fallout of Makee's decision, setting the stage for the final battle. The good news is that \"Transcendence\" has plenty of satisfying action that genuinely feels like what we love about Halo as a video game. The bad news is those questionable story choices continue to bring down our enjoyment of the series.\nWhen looking at the first season as a whole, it's clear that plenty of things could have been better. In that spirit, we finish out this episode of The GI Show and our Halo review with our thoughts on the state of Master Chief, Halsey, and Co.'s tale and whether or not we're excited about a second season. We also grade the show on the GI review scale for those dying to know what we thought numerically.\nThank you so much for joining us on this journey. While the show had its ups and downs, it was so fun to get to chat with the community on a weekly basis. We hope you enjoyed these videos, and we're so excited to continue our review series in the not too distant future. \nWhat do you think about Halo? Be sure to let us know in the comments below. We'd also love your feedback on the extra GI Show episodes. Do you like them? Do you want to see us focus on games or the Marvel shows in the future?

And now, today, you get to watch more than 20 minutes of our gameplay!\n\n\nAs you'll soon hear, not only did your hosts, Game Informer editors Wesley LeBlanc and Alex Stadnik, get the chance to go hands-on with Fueled Up, they were joined by two of the devs from Fireline Games – Kacper Kowalczuk and Chris Heldt – to round out the four-person team. If you're wondering how we did so well playing Fueled Up, just know it's because Wesley and Alex are really good at video games and totally not because they had two people who actually created this game helping them. \nVIDEO\nEnjoy this first look at Fueled Up gameplay on PC as Wesley and Alex ask them questions about the game, how the four-person development studio developed it, what they're hoping to add to the cooperative multiplayer space, and more. Be on the lookout for Fueled Up when it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC sometime this year. \nFor more about Fueled Up, be sure to watch the reveal trailer from last month.

          "description": "A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. \nThe game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. \nWatch on Twitch!\nFallen Order was released on November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. \nJoin Marcus Stewart, Andrew Reiner, and John Carson on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat.

Since its release, and subsequent Director’s Cut rerelease, fans have wondered what was next for Hideo Kojima, the director of Death Stranding and the Metal Gear Solid series. \nIt seems that what’s next might be a sequel to Death Stranding. That’s because in a new interview with Leo, Death Stranding actor Norman Reedus, who plays Sam Bridges in the game, seems to have confirmed a second one is now in production, as spotted first by GamerUP on Twitter. When asked about Death Stranding, Reedus said “we just started the second one” before diving deeper into how he got involved with the first Death Stranding. \nDeath Stranding 2, or a sequel to Death Stranding, has not been officially revealed or even hinted at by PlayStation or Kojima. Of course, Kojima could be working on other games right now too – in fact, he recently hinted that he might be working on two upcoming games – and those might even release before this Death Stranding sequel if what Reedus said is true. Only time will tell for now but it’s great to be a Death Stranding fan, it seems. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer’s Death Stranding review and then read our impressions of Death Stranding Director’s Cut. Read about how Kojima might be working on two upcoming games after that. \n[Source: Leo via GamerUP]\nDo you want a sequel to Death Stranding? Let us know in the comments below!",

The lights begin turning off on Monday, May 23, when players lose the ability to add eShop funds using credit cards.\nIf you’ve recently turned on your 3DS or Wii U, you likely received a notification reminding you that your stored credit cards will soon become useless. You’ll still be able to add money using Nintendo eShop gift cards – that option won’t disappear until August 29. But if you want to take advantage of the convenience of using your own payment methods without taking a trip to the store, this weekend is your last chance to unleash a final spending spree. Nintendo has not specified the exact time on Monday that credit cards will be disabled.  \nKeep in mind that even once credit and gift card options go away, players can link their Nintendo Network ID wallet (used for the 3DS/Wii U stores) with their Nintendo Account wallet (used to buy Switch games). The combined balance of both wallets can be used buy software on all three platforms. Once August passes, this will be the only method of buying 3DS/Wii U games until the March deadline. Afterward, whatever funds remain can only be spent on Switch purchases. \nAs a final reminder, you will still be able to play 3DS/Wii U games online and redownload purchased games, DLC, and updates after March 2023. Nintendo states this will remain the case for “the foreseeable future.”\nFor more information, visit Nintendo’s Q&A support page for the shutdown process.",

          "description": "TT Games’ Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga hit consoles and PC last month and since its release, it’s received two new character packs. Today, however, it received its first patch and after downloading it, you’ll find that there are 34 new Kyber Bricks to discover. \nWhile this is the first update for The Skywalker Saga, it is surprisingly a smaller one, bringing just a few fixes and a handful of Capital Ship encounters with it, as reported by Nintendo Everything.\n\n\nHere’s a look at the full patch notes for this May 2022 update: \nNumerous fixes to stability, quality, progression and performance issues throughout the title, including fixes for:\nIssue in Episode 7 where in certain situations Maz would not be present on Takodana to continue Story mission ‘Friends of the Resistance’.\nIssue in Episode 3 where in certain situations the level trigger for ‘The High Ground’ could fail to appear.\nIssue in ‘Green Harvest’ freeplay mission where under certain criteria the camera would be stuck on Tatooine indefinitely.\nImplemented 4 new Capital Ship encounters in Local Space adding 34 additional Kyber Bricks to collect:\nFulminatrix\nHome One\nInvisible Hand\nVenator\nAs you can see, the patch fixes three issues that, if encountered, could stop your progression forward in the game. It also adds four new Capital Ship encounters to The Skywalker Saga, which includes with it 34 additional Kyber Bricks to collect. \nWhile waiting for this patch to download, read Game Informer’s Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga review, and then check out our guide of codes to unlock additional characters in Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga. Check out these awesome new Star Wars dioramas recently debuted by Lego after that. \n[Source: Nintendo Everything]\nHave you played Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga?

According to Bend Studio, PlayStation's trophies are coming to select classic games included with the new PlayStation Plus subscription tiers.\nIncoming From Bend Studio:\npic.twitter.com/YVdMixZxBR\nMay 19, 2022\nBend Studio announced in a tweet today that Syphon Filter is going to come packed with trophies to obtain when it releases as part of the upcoming PlayStation Plus expansion. The tweet reads, \"Incoming From Bend Studio: Agency intel reports that Syphon Filter will include trophies when it arrives on the all-new PlayStation Plus.\" The message was delivered with an attached video of a silver trophy notification for a milestone called \"An Explosive Start.\" A follow-up tweet reveals the existence of a platinum trophy for the game as well. That trophy has the name \"Excellent work, Agent.\"\nWith the reveal of Syphon Filter joining the ranks of platinum-able games, more studios will hopefully follow suit and reveal whether their games will use the achievement system. Sony unveiled a selection of games coming to PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium subscription tiers, including original PlayStation games like Ape Escape, Hot Shots Golf, I.Q. Intelligent Cube, and Jumping Flash, though Syphon Filter is the only one on the list confirmed for trophy support.\nPlayStation Plus' revamp adds two more pricing tiers with value-adds such as a downloadable game library and cloud streaming on compatible devices and PCs. You can read about the pricing and tier differences here. The new subscription tiers go live on June 13 in North America.\nWhich classic PlayStation games would you like to see with trophy support?

          "description": "Yesterday, Marvel teased that it would be announcing a new video game today, and it has done just that with Marvel Snap, a new free-to-play collectible card game for PC and mobile devices developed by Nuverse and Second Dinner. \nMarvel calls it a “revolutionary game experience that unleashes the entire Marvel multiverse into a fast-paced, adrenaline-pumping card battle” that tasks players with assembling their ultimate Marvel dream team complete with both heroes and villains. To do so, players will need to collect “endless” card variants and use them in collectible card game plays. Each card game match lasts about three minutes. It is set to launch later this year. \n\n\n“Featuring 150+ iconic Marvel characters, Marvel Snap brings together stunning art from Marvel’s rich 80-year history with beautiful, brand new original illustrations to deliver hundreds of collectible art pieces in an intense player vs. player (PVP) fast-paced CCG,” a press release reads. “Marvel Snap introduces a new way to compete for the highest ranks, allowing players to ‘Snap’ to raise the stakes and double down. The mind games and bluffing inherent in this innovative mechanic create a game that is truly impossible to master.” \n\nAt launch, Marvel Snap will feature more than 150 “unique cards,” and each will have multiple variations. According to the press release, each match will feature three of more than 50 random Marvel locations with game-changing effects. \n\nBeginning today, you can sign up for a limited edition closed beta on Android devices here. When the game launches later this year, it will be available in 13 different languages on PC and mobile devices. \nIn regards to the development teams, Nuverse is perhaps best known for its work on mobile titles such as Sonic at the Olympic Games – Tokyo 2020, One Piece: Blood Routes, and Warhammer 40,000: Lost Crusade. Second Dinner is comprised of developers that have worked on Hearthstone, World of Warcraft, Halo, and more. \nAre you excited for Marvel Snap? Let us know in the comments below!",

Double-teaming mobs of enemies or a sturdy boss strengthens bonds. Conversely, repeatedly grabbing health pick-ups “on accident” with a full health bar while your friend hangs on by a thread can reveal cracks in a relationship.

          "description": "Developer Spiders has announced GreedFall 2: The Dying World, a sequel to its 2019 role-playing game GreedFall.\nThe game takes place three years after the events of GreedFall. Players control a native of Teer Fradee, the first game’s island setting, who is captured and taken to the continent of Gacane. This nation is the home of the invading colonists, and it has fallen due to a combination of a deadly plague and political infighting between various factions. It’s up to you to prevent this unfamiliar land and your home from succumbing to disaster.\n\n\nLike the first game, players can solve problems using diplomacy or aggression. Spiders also promises GreedFall 2 boasts new mechanics and more tactical combat but doesn’t elaborate on either bullet point. \nThe studio currently has its hands full creating Steelrising, its French Revolution action RPG slated for September. Thus, GreedFall 2: The Dying World won’t arrive until 2024 for PC and unspecified consoles. \nThe first GreedFall had cool ideas, but it ultimately left us wanting more. We’re curious to see how the sequel builds upon its solid foundation. You can read our GreedFall review here.",

His vision: give younger developers a chance to direct their own games and provide opportunities they might not get at other companies. Or, more bluntly, as he told Polygon in 2014, let people under 40 direct games.\n“If you’re over 40, you’re somewhat out of touch with the people buying your games,” Mikami told the outlet, “and when you’re young, you don’t know enough about the industry.

          "description": "Marvel has revealed that it is announcing a new game tomorrow, May 18. \nThis news comes by way of a new tweet from the official Marvel Entertainment Twitter account, which teases the game in a quick 22-second video. As for when, Marvel says “Tune in tomorrow at 10 AM PST,” which means we’re already less than 24 hours away from finding out exactly what it is. You can check out the teaser below: \nNew Game Announcement!\npic.twitter.com/TIHbrUqmOK\nMay 18, 2022\nAs you can see, we get a glimpse at America Chavez, who you might have just recently seen in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Ironheart, who is getting her own Disney Plus series, and Venom. There also appears to be some Doombots or some kind of enemy minion related to Doctor Doom. However, the teaser ends with a splash screen with more than 100 Marvel character logos ranging from deeper cut characters like Blink and Quake to more mainstream ones such as Thanos and Wolverine. \nElsewhere in the trailer, we see the Nuverse Logo and the Second Dinner logo, both game development studios. Nuverse is perhaps best known for its work on mobile titles such as Sonic at the Olympic Games – Tokyo 2020, One Piece: Blood Routes, and Warhammer 40,000: Lost Crusade. Second Dinner has worked on Hearthstone, World of Warcraft, Halo, and more. With this in mind, it might be possible that Marvel is teasing a mobile game considering both studios have a pedigree in that space. Of course, it could turn out to be a full console game too. Only time will tell for now but fortunately, you don’t have to wait too long. \nIn the meantime, check out our list of upcoming superhero games and then read about why one Game Informer editor believes it’s time for Doctor Strange to get his own game. Check out Game Informer’s Marvel’s Midnight Suns hub for more information about that game, which might be out sooner than you think. \nWhat kind of game do you hope this new Marvel game is?

Slated to release this December, this figure comes with three face plates, allowing you to harness a little more realism, depending on what weapon or pose you put Aloy in. She stands at approximately 3.94 inches in height.\nAlong with the amazing game, Aloy has had a big year, making an appearance in Fortnite as a purchasable skin, and will likely be featured in the PlayStation VR2 game, Horizon: Call of the Mountain, which we hope hits in the months ahead.\nIf you are collector of game merchandise, Nendoroid has long been turning popular game leads into cute figures.

The game was scheduled to launch this September, but it’s been pushed to 2023. \nThe long-awaited revival of the dormant racing franchise needs more time in the shop to polish up its systems, according to an update by publisher Nacon (thanks, Eurogamer). The statement reads in part: \n“With so much support from fans of the series, we know many of you will be disappointed, but our goal with Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown is to make it the most polished gaming experience in the franchise by spending more time on its development.” \nTo soften the blow, the team announced plans to hold closed betas at some point in the future, giving players a chance to sit behind the wheel before launch. \nNacon has also decided to cancel the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of Solar Crown “with the aim of making the most of the technology in the latest consoles.\" You can now pick up the game on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Solar Crown joins Gotham Knights as another cross-generation title to abandon its planned last-gen ports in favor of maximizing the current-gen experience. \nTest Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown was first unveiled in 2020 and is the first entry in the franchise since 2012's Test Drive: Ferrari Racing Legends (although the last Unlimited game was Unlimited 2 in 2011). The game tasks racing fans with aligning themselves with one of two clans, The Streets and The Sharps, to compete in races across an expansive Hong Kong Island. Outside of races, players can explore and expand the headquarters of their chosen faction. \n2022 has seen several high-profile titles get pushed into the following year. You can check out the complete list of those games here.",

The game’s 3v3 contests combine skating, racing, and a bit of rugby. Teams skate around a track carrying a ball to toss through a goal for points. You can also earn additional points based on the number of laps you complete. Maintaining possession of the ball requires players to rough each other up using tackle moves and other attacks. Roller Champions ups the ante on real-life roller derby by letting players skate up and along walls and perform other over-the-top moves. \n\n\nAs players rack up victories they’ll climb the ladder of a championship league to gain new stadiums, maps, and fans. Your Champion can be customized with unlockable items earned both in-game and through a season pass (dubbed a Roller Pass). A social hub fashioned as a skatepark allows friends and other players to meet up, practice, or indulge in mini-games. \nRoller Champions supports cross-play and cross-progression between PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC through the Ubisoft Store. The game is also playable on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S via backward compatibility. Ubisoft also plans to bring Roller Champions to Switch, Stadia, and Amazon Luna at a later date. \nRoller Champions was first announced during E3 2019 with a pre-alpha demo. You can watch us take that version of the game for a spin in this episode of New Gameplay Today.",

That’s because as the name implies, it takes place in the Hisui region of Pokémon, which debuted in Legends: Arceus. It’s the ancient version of the Sinnoh region and most people there aren’t too keen to live alongside Pokémon like the trainers we’ve all battled against in the mainline games. That discrepancy is at the heart of the first episode of Pokémon: Hisuian Snow, \"Onto the Icy Blue.\"\n“Across the Hisui region, many grow up believing people and Pokémon cannot live together,” the YouTube description for Episode 1 reads. “But when Alec meets a Hisuian Zorua, he may need to rethink how he views Pokémon.” \n\n\nWe won’t spoil here what happens, but you can check out the episode above. It’s a great start to Pokémon: Hisuian Snow and its beautiful art already has me on the lookout for the next episode. \nAfter watching it, read Game Informer’s Pokémon Legends: Arceus review and then read about the recent Daybreak update for the game.

As for what this Final Fantasy VII news will be, it could theoretically be anything related to the franchise including The First Soldier, the original FFVII and its subsequent rereleases, Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis, or possibly (hopefully) news about Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2. \nThe last we heard about Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2 was that it could “differ significantly” from the original, which wouldn’t be surprising considering the changes and additions made in Final Fantasy VII Remake compared to the original game’s first handful of hours. In an ideal world, we hear about Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2 next month and then we hear about Final Fantasy XVI soon after, especially considering producer Naoki Yoshida recently revealed it’s near the end of development. \nAll of this would tie into a tease from a new Final Fantasy 35th Anniversary website that launched in March. It not only celebrates the series’ history, but teases information on upcoming titles, too. Upcoming titles could include Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2, Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis, or even Final Fantasy XVI. Only time will for now. \nWhile waiting to learn more, read Game Informer’s Final Fantasy VII Remake review and then read about how Final Fantasy XVI has an “expansive” skill tree, according to its producer. Check out Game Informer’s ranking of every mainline Final Fantasy game after that. \n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]\nWhich Final Fantasy game in development are you most excited to hear about again?

          "description": "Disney has unveiled the first trailer for She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, the upcoming Marvel series that premieres on Disney+ this August.\nJennifer Walters (Tatiana Maslany) is a lawyer juggling an increasingly chaotic life, including working for a newly launched superhuman law division. Her cousin also happens to be Bruce Banner, AKA the Hulk. Walters gains a measure of the gamma radiation fueling Bruce to become a green powerhouse in her own right to smash evil in and out of the courtroom. The cast includes Mark Ruffalo, Jameela Jamill, and Tim Roth (reprising his role as Abomination). \n\n\nYou can also check out the official poster below:\nShe-Hulk made her comic debut in 1980 and, like her cousin, possesses superhuman strength, speed, stamina, healing, and durability. One of the most significant differences between Hulk and She-Hulk is that Jennifer largely retains her personality and intelligence while green, though usually with fewer inhibitions, as showcased at the end of the trailer. She’s traditionally portrayed as a skilled hand-to-hand fighter (trained by Captain America, among others), meaning she usually has far more finesse and is less destructive in a fight than Banner. Sometimes. \nShe-Hulk: Attorney at Law consists of nine episodes and premieres on August 17 on Disney+. It serves as the third Marvel TV series for 2022, following Moon Knight and the upcoming Ms. Marvel, which begins streaming in June. \nWhat do you think of this first look at She-Hulk?

I won’t tell anyone that either emotion is invalid, but I do take exception to the sentiment that established franchises should stay in their lane and aren’t allowed to stretch their wings to other genres. After all, several of the best games and even series were spawned when their creators flexed an IP’s versatility. So before you write off a Dead by Daylight visual novel, here are just a few examples – not a definitive list or ranking – of other wild spin-offs that became big success stories in their own right. \n  \n\n\n\n      \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nSuper Puzzle Fighter II Turbo\nStreet Fighter built its reputation by mastering the simp…",

This wild spin-off surgically removes Dead by Daylight’s terrifying killers and plops them into the romantic bubblegum world of dating sims.\nIf you’ve ever longed to court The Huntress after she brutally slaughtered you, Hooked on You: A Dead by Daylight Dating Sim is the game you’ve been waiting for. Launching later this year, this visual novel tasks would-be lovers to flirt their way into the hearts of four Killers: The Wraith, The Spirit, The Huntress, and The Trapper. Through choice-driven conversations, you’ll forge friendships or steamy relationships with these monsters to learn their personal histories and uncover the broader stories of what got them here in the first place. \n\n\n“You wanted it? You got it! Hooked on You: A Dead by Daylight Dating Sim mixes horror, humor and romance to create a fresh way for fans to interact and create an emotional bond with their favorite Killers,” says Mathieu Côté, Head of Partnerships for Dead by Daylight. “Our goal with our first visual novel is to provide fans with a completely unique and surprising new way to experience the world of Dead by Daylight.”\nHooked on You: A Dead by Daylight Dating Sim comes from Psyop, the team behind the equally silly KFC dating sim I Love You, Colonel Sanders! A Finger Lickin’ Good Dating Simulator. It doesn’t have a release date, but it’s coming to Steam sometime this summer.",
