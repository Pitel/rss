          "description": "Brain reaction.\nRecently, I was talking to my partner about my all-time favourite niche genre of games. He's a game developer, so we have these kinds of discussions a lot, usually trying to nail down what it is we like best about a particular game, or scene, or genre — but this time, we were trying to find out exactly what the genre even was.\nNow, I have a particular bugbear when it comes to game genres, which is that they're all pretty stupid. They're not helpful for casual consumers (who often don't know what things like \"roguelike\" are) and they're largely descriptive of the actions one takes or responds to (\"shooter\", \"platformer\") rather than the tone or feeling of a game. I mean, these genres can be useful, like, for example, if you're making really cool lists of games and you need some kind of unifying feature so you can let people know where to find what they're looking for, but otherwise, game genres are weirdly unhelpful, mechanical, and self-referential.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The week wait might be a bit agonising for JRPG fans, but we have a few teasers to get us even more excited.

          "description": "We did a lot of cool things during our time at this year's PAX East. We attended a wonderful talk by \"Skyrim Grandma\" Shirley Curry. We gawked at the coolest booths on the show floor. I got nightmares after looking at a super cursed baby. My personal highlight, though, was talking to the Pinny Arcade collectors during the show's official trading event.\r\n\n\r\nI’ll admit, before I went to PAX I didn’t really appreciate how big Pinny Arcade was. I’d definitely seen photos of colourful metal pins depicting characters from various video games fly across my screen as I browsed Twitter, but I had never thought much about them beyond that. I was shocked, then, to arrive at PAX and realise just how integral this collectable is to the show. Merch booths sell starter packs, individual demo stations flog game specific rarities and avid fans adorn their lanyards with their favourite pieces. It turns out, Pinny Arcade is huge. \r\n\n \nRead more",

This is all by way of introduction to Eternal Threads, a puzzle game where you go back in time to stop everyone in a house share dying in a fire. \nTo save a present that has been rendered apocalyptic by time travel itself, you are part of a team who go back and change tiny things in the past to fix it, in this case 2015. While it is imperative for some reason that the fire does indeed happen, it is just as important that all six occupants live. You can alter small decisions they make in the week running up to the fire, and so save their lives by choosing whether they go to the pub, if they comfort each other in times of need, or what they have arguments about.

With its late summer release fast approaching, Volition recently showed off a larger chunk of some actual gameplay to press in another remote preview session. It looks almost exactly like what you'd expect it to look like: a fun open world game where you shoot people and smash cars into other cars.\nBarring any catastrophic eventualities where this game actually ends up being just a load of bugs propping up other bugs in a fluorescent trenchcoat, I feel almost 100% confident in saying to you that this will be an enjoyable product when it comes out. But I also should be honest and say that the gameplay I saw has congealed into the same kind of sticky morass and blurred whirling lights in my memory as my first all-night benders. It's a big collage of colours and explosions, and words like \"cops\", \"switch car\" and \"plan\", leaving a general impression of fun but, so far, few specifics in its wake. And to be even more frank about it all, I can't think of a nailed on reason why any of it has to be a Saints Row game.\nRead more",

Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong has taught me that they actually spend most of their time walking around looking at things, sometimes stopping to have tense conversations or pick up keycards. There is occasional eating.\nThis is probably because the three vampires you play as in Swansong aren't exactly on their down-time. Set in Boston in 2019, you begin in medias res after a sudden violent attack on a party has left the Boston vampire court reeling. The Prince, an Annie Lennox cosplayer called Hazel Iverson, has called three of her most trusted lieutenants in to firstly check on the immediate aftermath, and thereafter investigate the wider fallout and strike against whodunnit. Since developers Big Bad Wolf are the folks behind The Council, the role you take isn't an action hero but different shades of spy and/or detective. Neither leaves you much time to loaf about being all sexy, though. \nRead more",

It showed Eve Online’s learning curve as a comedy cliff face, so steep that it turned back on itself. Stickmen tumbled from its peak, while others were crucified or hanged from the curve’s mantel - killed by Eve’s notoriously cruel new player experience. It earned a laugh of grim recognition from the audience, all survivors of that terrible climb.\nRead more",

Card Shark, the latest game from the Reigns devs Nerial, is an ideal card game for me, as it does all the noises of shuffling and dealing and collecting cards extremely well, without requiring any knowledge or memory of the games its punters are actually playing. \nInstead, Card Shark is all about the palming and stacking and counting of cards, rather than an actual card game like your classic deckbuilders and such like. It will be out in full on June 2nd, but last week I got to play a larger version of the current Steam demo - about four hours worth of it, in fact - and I discovered that while I'm very bad at card games, I am pretty good at (pretend) cheating at them.\nRead more",

          "description": "AMD’s FSR 2.0 upscaler is out now – in only one game, Deathloop, but still. This is a big moment for the heavily upgraded FSR (FidelityFX Super Resolution), as it’s basically attempting to fight Nvidia’s rival DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) with some of its own tactics. There’s none of Nvidia’s machine learning enhancements, but whereas FSR 1.0 was a simple spatial upscaler – meaning data used for upscaling a frame could only come from within the frame itself – FSR 2.0 uses a temporal upscaling technique similar to that of DLSS. This allows it to draw data from previous frames as well, producing a sharper, higher-quality image. \r\n\n\r\nThe lack of machine learning also has the upside of keeping FSR 2.0, like FSR 1.0, compatible with any reasonably recent gaming GPU. Nvidia may make most of this generation’s best graphics cards, but you won't need something brand new and super powerful to let FSR 2.0 boost your frame rates. To find out how well it works, compared to both DLSS and FSR 1.0, I reinstalled Deathloop and gave all three upscalers a whirl.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The Lego games I'm most familiar with are the licensed property games - yer Lego Indiana Joneses and yer Lego Star Warses where you run around a continuous level smashing things. Lego Bricktales is more akin to last year's extremely cute geometric puzzler Lego Builder's Journey, in that you're exploring detailed, colourful brick dioramas, and solving puzzles by bulding things out of titular hot-property block. In Bricktales, though, it's way more granular. You're whisked away into a separate building screen to construct and stress test things like bridges and beams to support a platform, for example. You have a set number of different shaped and sized bricks to work with.\nFrom playing a preview build of the first level - a jungle, home to some lost explorers - the thing that impresses me most about Bricktales is just how much it's like building things with actual Lego. It sounds stupid to say, but them little bricks are really astonishingly realised. It all looks so much Lego it's sort of surprising that you can't reach through the screen and pick it up. It's amazing. It's the closest thing to Lego you can get outside of actual Lego - which is the problem. It just kind of makes you miss Lego.\nRead more",

          "description": "Bring back that lovin' feelin'...\nIt's been some time since we last heard from action-packed sky-flier Ace Combat 7, but would-be pilots will certainly be feeling the need for speed come May 26, when Bandai Namco drops a batch of brand new DLC based on Paramount Pictures' upcoming blockbuster Top Gun: Maverick. \nThe Ace Combat 7 — Top Gun: Maverick Aircraft Set DLC adds two new skyfighters to the game's hanger. First up is the stunning F/A-18E Super Hornet, as flown by Top Gun's white-teethed, cheesy-grinnin' hero Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, portrayed in the movie series by alien daredevil Tom Cruise. Oh, and for those of you who truly want to take it right-in-to-the danger zone, then it seems that a replica of Maverick and Goose's F-14A Tomcat from the 1986 movie is also included.\nThe trailer below spotlights the F/A-18E Super Hornet, as well as the movie's fret-wanking theme.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7ujkyWqbfo\nReleased way back in 2019, which today feels a whole world away, Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown was a hit with the dedicated Ace Combat community, who celebrated its snazzy visuals, frenetic gameplay, and surprisingly deep lore. The initial release would be followed by a slew of extra missions and aircraft updates. While the game is certainly in its twilight years today, this Top Gun: Maverick crossover is an absolute no-brainer, and will be likely very welcome among the game's long-time community of players.\nAce Combat 7: Skies Unknown is available now on PS4, PC, and Xbox One. Top Gun: Maverick premieres in theaters May 27 and is, apparently, an excellent sequel, with some reviewers going as far as to say that it surpasses the original. Jennifer Connelly is in it, so that seems a given, to be honest.\nThe post Top Gun: Maverick DLC jets into Ace Combat 7 next week appeared first on Destructoid.",

In a new statement (as noted by Eurogamer), the industry giant announced that it would be bringing its \"Road to Zero\" green efficiency plan forward, with an aim of severely reducing its carbon footprint within the coming decades.\nSony is looking to achieve its ambitious renewable energy goals by revising the power input and output of its global network of offices and production plants. The PlayStation publisher will be looking to install solar panels at its various international locations, whilst exploring other energy-saving measures. The company hopes to have increased its renewable energy usage to 35% by 2025, and 100% by 2030.\nIn addition, Sony hopes to be fully carbon neutral by 2040, while also ensuring that its wide variety of home entertainment products also produce less planet-harming emissions and run as energy-efficiently as possible. The climax of the \"Road to Zero\" plan would see Sony achieve its \"zero environmental footprint throughout the lifecycle of Sony's products and business activities\" goal by the year 2050.\nFor more details on the updated Road to Zero plan, check out Sony's official statement.\nThe post Sony revises green goals, aims for 100% renewable energy by 2030 appeared first on Destructoid.",

As we edge ever closer to its June 28 launch date, the publisher is spittin' out new trailers left, right, and center — even affording the fighter's Practice Mode its own spotlight!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMmd77abac0\nThe trailer offers us a glimpse of DNF Duel's Training and Tutorial modes, which hope to get newcomers up and running while helping veteran fighting game players adapt to DNF Duel's flow and mechanics.\nWe can see from the video that the Training Mode is packed out with all of the requisite options, including gauge management, record/playback functions, character stances, wake-up practice, and much more. In addition, the tutorial offers playable trials teaching players basic movement all the way up to performing DNF Duel's attractive and dynamic Supers.\nAn adaptation of Korean MMO Dungeon Fighter Online, DNF Duel is developed by fighting game veterans Eighting and Arc System Works, which automatically lend the new title a solid sense of quality and legitimacy. It will be an uphill battle for the plucky upstart to find its name among the Tekkens and Street Fighters of the scene, but it's looking like a pretty slick scrapper, and I'm excited to check out the final product.\nDNF Duel launches June 28 on PlayStation and PC platforms. Be sure to check out the previous trailers introducing us to characters for Berserker, Grappler, Hitman, Inquisitor, Striker, Ranger, Dragon Knight, Vanguard, Kunoichi, Crusader, and Ghostblade.\nThe post DNF Duel’s Practice Mode apparently deserves its own trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

Norman Reedus, star of The Walking Dead TV series who played Sam \"Porter\" Bridges in Death Stranding, seems to have just confirmed a part two in a new interview.\nIn an interview with LeoEdit (spotted by GamerUP), Reedus is asked about filming for the Death Stranding video game. To which he responds, \"We just started the second one.\"\nIn a follow-up question, Reedus tells the story of how he and Hideo Kojima met through mutual friend Guillermo Del Toro. He describes seeing an early version of Kojima's Silent Hill project. Reedus committed and well, the rest is long, fraught video game history.\n\"It took me maybe two or three years to finish all the MoCap sessions and everything,\" said Reedus. \"It takes a lot of work. And then the game came out, and it just won all these awards, and it was a huge thing, so we just started part two of that.\"\nWell, that certainly reads like two confirmations of a new Death Stranding.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlLEmu8c-Vk\nBridging the gap\nKojima has teased a bit about his next project in the past. In June 2020, he posted some images of his workspace as he worked on a new title with Yoji Shinkawa, one of his longtime collaborators. Fans at the time even spotted the word \"Bridges\" on some concept art.\nBut Kojima has also been rumored to up to several different projects. A report indicated he was working with Microsoft for an Xbox game. And he also told Famitsu that his next project is a big title that is a \"new challenge.\"\nDeath Stranding did get a Director's Cut last year, adding new content and tools for Sam to make the journey across America. We haven't had any indication of a sequel until now though. But according to Norman Reedus, I guess we can look forward to a possible new Death Stranding.\nThe post Norman Reedus says there’s a second Death Stranding on the way appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The old waiting game...\nSquare Enix has splurged out on a selection of mysterious trademarks, recently filed in Japan and seemingly related to its iconic RPG title Final Fantasy VII Remake as well as multiple unknown IPS.\nThe first of the three trademarks, as noted by Gematsu, is for Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade. A title that is already available on PS5 and PC via Epic Games Store. The trademark could suggest that a re-release is being prepared, perhaps for the PC via the Steam Store or for another platform entirely.\nThe other two trademarks are a total mystery, and see the publisher lay claim to \"Final Bar Line\" and \"Labyrinth Striker.\" Interestingly, both titles sound like they'd be more fitting as subtitles than actual game names, which has led some to theorize that they may represent spin-offs from some of Square's franchises, such as Kingdom Hearts, Bravely Default, Dragon Quest, Octopath Traveler, or, of course, Final Fantasy itself.\nFor now, it all remains little more than speculation. But, with another summer of gaming reveals up ahead, it will be interesting to see if any of these new names will be coming into play in the latter half of 2022.\nThe post Square Enix files mystery Final Fantasy VII, Labyrinth Striker, and Final Bar Line trademarks appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Player Toxicity Expected\nFuncom has released a new trailer for its upcoming doomsday shooter Metal: Hellsinger — the new video features the unmistakable vocals of Serj Tankian, long-time frontman of metal band System of a Down. Tankian joins a roster of metal legends that will soundtrack the next-gen shooter's violent chaos.\n\"What can you even say! We have so many System of a Down fans in the studio, adding Serj Tankian to our already incredible roster of vocalists feels unreal,\" said David Goldfarb of developer The Outsiders. \"He completely killed the track and made it his own in a way only Serj could. We are so excited and can’t wait to see everyone playing!\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vig4_lsrpto\nAs FPS fans will immediately note, Metal: Hellsinger features the typically apocalyptic vibe of the genre's roots, founded in titles such as Doom, Hexen, Quake, and Heretic. In a fun new twist on the classic first-person gameplay, however, players will be rewarded for their ability to run 'n' gun to the beat of the game's bass-pounding score, chaining together combos and meaty acts of destruction in time with the music — a gimmick similarly explored to solid effect in 2021 release BPM: Bullets per Minute.\nTankian joins a horn-throwing roster of composers that already includes Arch Enemy's Alissa White-Gluz, Trivium's Matt Heafy, and the dulcet tones of Lamb of God's Randy Blythe. More artists are expected to be announced in the near future. It feels as though Mike Patton should most definitely be here, but the Faith No More/Fantomas frontman is currently taking a well-earned sabbatical from work, so that may just be wishful thinking on my part.\nMetal: Hellsinger is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.\nThe post SOAD’s Serj Tankian joins metal legends to score Metal: Hellsinger appeared first on Destructoid.",

I always loved the animation style, and although it's a movie that's known for being a tear-jerker, it earns it with some excellent writing. It's a shame that Warner Bros. Animation shut down in 2004, because they had some truly iconic films back in the day. I don't know anyone who wasn't touched by the story of friendship and pacifism that we saw from The Iron Giant. I think a lot of us who grew up with the film feel a bit protective over it because of how earnest it was — or at least, that's how I feel.

No details were revealed as to the context of Akiba Maid War, with only a simple logo released so far. As noted by Gematsu, the Japanese text \"Akiba Meido Sensou\" is a fun pun, as \"Meido\" is phonetically pronounced \"Maid\" but as written is the word for \"Underworld.\"\nThat's all well and good, CyGames, but frankly, I just want my tea and biscuits. Failing that, I just want to dress up as a maid. No doubt we will hear more about Akiba Maid War as the year progresses, as it's getting to be about that time. Maybe it'll be a great third-person console adventure, maybe it will be a garbage gacha mobile game. Until Cygames is ready to spill the tea, it could go either way. Schrodinger's Maid, if you will.

          "description": "Gotta pump the brakes\nPublisher Nacon delivered a lot of good news during yesterday's Nacon Connect presentation — including the reveal of a GreedFall sequel and a new WRC title — but this was slightly offset by the bum news that the next entry in the Test Drive Unlimited series, Solar Crown, would no longer be meeting its originally planned 2022 release date.\n\"With so much support from fans of the series, we know many of you will be disappointed, but our goal with Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown is to make it the most polished gaming experience in the franchise by spending more time on its development,\" writes Nacon in a statement on Steam. \"We therefore want to thank the fan community for your support and daily involvement on the game's official Discord channel and within communities on the various social media platforms.\nThe attractive road racer, which was originally scheduled to launch this fall, will now arrive at some point in 2023. In addition, Nacon announced that the PS4 and Xbox One editions of the sequel have been canceled, with Solar Crown now solely in development for PS5, PC, Xbox Series X, and, perhaps surprisingly, Nintendo Switch. Perhaps the most ambitious TDU title to date, Solar Crown hopes to fully replicate a digital version of Hong Kong Island as the backdrop for its polished, high-speed racing action.\nTest Drive Unlimited Solar Crown is currently in development for PS5, PC, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch. A closed beta is expected to launch later in 2022.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yh-B5l8xB6s\nThe post Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown delayed to 2023, last-gen versions canned appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The shinier Wild Hunt looms closer\nGeralt's adventures won't be waiting too long to hit the newer generation of consoles. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt next-gen version is now slated to launch sometime in Q4 2022.\nThe news arrives today via The Witcher Twitter account, roughly lining up with the seventh anniversary of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's launch. The next-gen version, which should bring The Witcher 3 onto PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S as its own version, is planned to release in Q4 2022.\nhttps://twitter.com/witchergame/status/1527299944834510854\nThe next-gen version of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt has slid around a fair bit. It moved into 2022 and then, most recently, slid into an undefined window. Alongside that news, CD Projekt also confirmed that it was bringing development in-house, rather than over at Saber Interactive. The team at Saber had previously handled The Witcher 3's Nintendo Switch port.\nSomething ends, something begins\nCD Projekt had this next-gen version in the works alongside Cyberpunk 2077 next-gen. The latter launched in February, in a surprising reveal and release event.\nBut while Cyberpunk 2077 is a fairly new game, it's been seven years since the launch of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. It's a massive game, but it's fair to say that Witcher fans would probably like to see how the world looks on newer hardware.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOnpO5A7bAU\nAnticipation for new Witcher content is likely also higher than usual, thanks to the recent announcement of a new Witcher in development. The next step in The Witcher universe is being made in Unreal Engine 5 at CD Projekt Red.\nThe studio has also been strictly calling it a new saga. With a new step forward in the world, it'd be nice to have a next-gen version of Geralt's journey too. The old witcher got a nice send-off with Blood and Wine, and it'd be nice to re-experience that.\nWe'll see what CD Projekt Red's got in store as the year rolls on.\nThe post The Witcher 3 next-gen versions will arrive in Q4 2022 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Before the sequel comes out and likely does the same, we can enjoy this God of War Simpsons mod.\nCreated as part of Omega Fantasy's Patreon, the mod swaps out Kratos for Homer, and his son Atreus for Bart — with Flanders butting in as \"The Stranger.\" The gameplay is effectively the same, but you get the new character models (including a reworked [Wonder]bat instead of Kratos' Leviathan Axe). YouTuber ToastedShoes also managed to hire voice actors to add a finishing touch, which really makes the below video worth watching. They even completely change the script to make it more like one of those \"trilogy/what if\" Simpsons episodes.\nThe voices are done by Benjamin Rudman (Homer), June Briar (Bart), and Brock Baker (Flanders), and I have to say, the performances make it. You can't really sell Flanders fighting Homer without some sort of \"diddly\" rant, and the relationship between Homer and Bart is even funnier with them talking directly to each other.\nA lot of people in the YouTube comments are calling for a Peter Griffin versus the Chicken mod — and with plenty of Peter soundalikes out there, I think someone can make it happen.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu031MIoZpM\nThe post A God of War Simpsons mod with added voice acting is chef kiss appeared first on Destructoid.",

Citing his own sources, Grubb noted that he was \"pretty confident\" that a Last of Us remake is already pushing completion, and is likely to launch in the 2022 holiday season. It's well worth noting that Grubb's estimation matches that of fellow leak machine Tom Henderson, who has also previously speculated a Holiday 2022 launch on the PS5 platform.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q3bMYTkMzk\nFirst inklings of a remake of Naughty Dog's highly acclaimed 2013 adventure surfaced in April 2021, following a consolidation of studios within Sony's gaming division. It is believed that Sony pulled its San Diego-based “Visual Art Service Group” team off of the project, which led to unrest among its members, some of which referenced The Last of Us remake in a report to Bloomberg.\nAround the same time, Sony Bend — who had reportedly begun work on a Days Gone sequel — was pulled off of the project in order to further assist Naughty Dog with its other major IP, Uncharted. These incidents led to a period of turmoil for many working within Sony's gaming division who felt that they were being pushed away from their own projects and ideas to essentially assist in the development of \"cash cows.\"\nIn addition to the rumored remake, Naughty Dog is also currently developing the multiplayer component of The Last of Us Part II, and is assisting in the production of HBO's TV adaptation.\nThe Last of Us PS5 remake is reportedly likely to be released in 2022 [VGC]\nThe post The Last of Us Remake could be launching as soon as late 2022 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Craddock and Chris Stratton. The project is in post-production and scheduled to release sometime during Q4 2022.

          "description": "A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. \nThe game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. \nWatch on Twitch!\nFallen Order was released on November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. \nJoin Marcus Stewart, Andrew Reiner, and John Carson on Twitch today at 2 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat.

          "description": "Death Stranding hit the PlayStation 4 back in 2019. Since its release, and subsequent Director’s Cut rerelease, fans have wondered what was next for Hideo Kojima, the director of Death Stranding and the Metal Gear Solid series. \nIt seems that what’s next might be a sequel to Death Stranding. That’s because in a new interview with Leo, Death Stranding actor Norman Reedus, who plays Sam Bridges in the game, seems to have confirmed a second one is now in production, as spotted first by GamerUP on Twitter. When asked about Death Stranding, Reedus said “we just started the second one” before diving deeper into how he got involved with the first Death Stranding. \nDeath Stranding 2, or a sequel to Death Stranding, has not been officially revealed or even hinted at by PlayStation or Kojima. Of course, Kojima could be working on other games right now too – in fact, he recently hinted that he might be working on two upcoming games – and those might even release before this Death Stranding sequel if what Reedus said is true. Only time will tell for now but it’s great to be a Death Stranding fan, it seems. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer’s Death Stranding review and then read our impressions of Death Stranding Director’s Cut. Read about how Kojima might be working on two upcoming games after that. \n[Source: Leo via GamerUP]\nDo you want a sequel to Death Stranding? Let us know in the comments below!",

The lights begin turning off on Monday, May 23, when players lose the ability to add eShop funds using credit cards.\nIf you’ve recently turned on your 3DS or Wii U, you likely received a notification reminding you that your stored credit cards will soon become useless. You’ll still be able to add money using Nintendo eShop gift cards – that option won’t disappear until August 29. But if you want to take advantage of the convenience of using your own payment methods without taking a trip to the store, this weekend is your last chance to unleash a final spending spree. Nintendo has not specified the exact time on Monday that credit cards will be disabled.  \nKeep in mind that even once credit and gift card options go away, players can link their Nintendo Network ID wallet (used for the 3DS/Wii U stores) with their Nintendo Account wallet (used to buy Switch games). The combined balance of both wallets can be used buy software on all three platforms. Once August passes, this will be the only method of buying 3DS/Wii U games until the March deadline. Afterward, whatever funds remain can only be spent on Switch purchases. \nAs a final reminder, you will still be able to play 3DS/Wii U games online and redownload purchased games, DLC, and updates after March 2023. Nintendo states this will remain the case for “the foreseeable future.”\nFor more information, visit Nintendo’s Q&A support page for the shutdown process.",

Today, however, it received its first patch and after downloading it, you’ll find that there are 34 new Kyber Bricks to discover. \nWhile this is the first update for The Skywalker Saga, it is surprisingly a smaller one, bringing just a few fixes and a handful of Capital Ship encounters with it, as reported by Nintendo Everything.\n\n\nHere’s a look at the full patch notes for this May 2022 update: \nNumerous fixes to stability, quality, progression and performance issues throughout the title, including fixes for:\nIssue in Episode 7 where in certain situations Maz would not be present on Takodana to continue Story mission ‘Friends of the Resistance’.\nIssue in Episode 3 where in certain situations the level trigger for ‘The High Ground’ could fail to appear.\nIssue in ‘Green Harvest’ freeplay mission where under certain criteria the camera would be stuck on Tatooine indefinitely.\nImplemented 4 new Capital Ship encounters in Local Space adding 34 additional Kyber Bricks to collect:\nFulminatrix\nHome One\nInvisible Hand\nVenator\nAs you can see, the patch fixes three issues that, if encountered, could stop your progression forward in the game.

The tweet reads, \"Incoming From Bend Studio: Agency intel reports that Syphon Filter will include trophies when it arrives on the all-new PlayStation Plus.\" The message was delivered with an attached video of a silver trophy notification for a milestone called \"An Explosive Start.\" A follow-up tweet reveals the existence of a platinum trophy for the game as well. That trophy has the name \"Excellent work, Agent.\"\nWith the reveal of Syphon Filter joining the ranks of platinum-able games, more studios will hopefully follow suit and reveal whether their games will use the achievement system. Sony unveiled a selection of games coming to PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium subscription tiers, including original PlayStation games like Ape Escape, Hot Shots Golf, I.Q.

          "description": "Yesterday, Marvel teased that it would be announcing a new video game today, and it has done just that with Marvel Snap, a new free-to-play collectible card game for PC and mobile devices developed by Nuverse and Second Dinner. \nMarvel calls it a “revolutionary game experience that unleashes the entire Marvel multiverse into a fast-paced, adrenaline-pumping card battle” that tasks players with assembling their ultimate Marvel dream team complete with both heroes and villains. To do so, players will need to collect “endless” card variants and use them in collectible card game plays. Each card game match lasts about three minutes. It is set to launch later this year. \n\n\n“Featuring 150+ iconic Marvel characters, Marvel Snap brings together stunning art from Marvel’s rich 80-year history with beautiful, brand new original illustrations to deliver hundreds of collectible art pieces in an intense player vs. player (PVP) fast-paced CCG,” a press release reads. “Marvel Snap introduces a new way to compete for the highest ranks, allowing players to ‘Snap’ to raise the stakes and double down. The mind games and bluffing inherent in this innovative mechanic create a game that is truly impossible to master.” \n\nAt launch, Marvel Snap will feature more than 150 “unique cards,” and each will have multiple variations. According to the press release, each match will feature three of more than 50 random Marvel locations with game-changing effects. \n\nBeginning today, you can sign up for a limited edition closed beta on Android devices here. When the game launches later this year, it will be available in 13 different languages on PC and mobile devices. \nIn regards to the development teams, Nuverse is perhaps best known for its work on mobile titles such as Sonic at the Olympic Games – Tokyo 2020, One Piece: Blood Routes, and Warhammer 40,000: Lost Crusade. Second Dinner is comprised of developers that have worked on Hearthstone, World of Warcraft, Halo, and more. \nAre you excited for Marvel Snap? Let us know in the comments below!",

This nation is the home of the invading colonists, and it has fallen due to a combination of a deadly plague and political infighting between various factions. It’s up to you to prevent this unfamiliar land and your home from succumbing to disaster.\n\n\nLike the first game, players can solve problems using diplomacy or aggression. Spiders also promises GreedFall 2 boasts new mechanics and more tactical combat but doesn’t elaborate on either bullet point. \nThe studio currently has its hands full creating Steelrising, its French Revolution action RPG slated for September. Thus, GreedFall 2: The Dying World won’t arrive until 2024 for PC and unspecified consoles. \nThe first GreedFall had cool ideas, but it ultimately left us wanting more.

As for when, Marvel says “Tune in tomorrow at 10 AM PST,” which means we’re already less than 24 hours away from finding out exactly what it is. You can check out the teaser below: \nNew Game Announcement!\npic.twitter.com/TIHbrUqmOK\nMay 18, 2022\nAs you can see, we get a glimpse at America Chavez, who you might have just recently seen in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Ironheart, who is getting her own Disney Plus series, and Venom. There also appears to be some Doombots or some kind of enemy minion related to Doctor Doom. However, the teaser ends with a splash screen with more than 100 Marvel character logos ranging from deeper cut characters like Blink and Quake to more mainstream ones such as Thanos and Wolverine. \nElsewhere in the trailer, we see the Nuverse Logo and the Second Dinner logo, both game development studios. Nuverse is perhaps best known for its work on mobile titles such as Sonic at the Olympic Games – Tokyo 2020, One Piece: Blood Routes, and Warhammer 40,000: Lost Crusade. Second Dinner has worked on Hearthstone, World of Warcraft, Halo, and more. With this in mind, it might be possible that Marvel is teasing a mobile game considering both studios have a pedigree in that space. Of course, it could turn out to be a full console game too. Only time will tell for now but fortunately, you don’t have to wait too long. \nIn the meantime, check out our list of upcoming superhero games and then read about why one Game Informer editor believes it’s time for Doctor Strange to get his own game.

The game was scheduled to launch this September, but it’s been pushed to 2023. \nThe long-awaited revival of the dormant racing franchise needs more time in the shop to polish up its systems, according to an update by publisher Nacon (thanks, Eurogamer). The statement reads in part: \n“With so much support from fans of the series, we know many of you will be disappointed, but our goal with Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown is to make it the most polished gaming experience in the franchise by spending more time on its development.” \nTo soften the blow, the team announced plans to hold closed betas at some point in the future, giving players a chance to sit behind the wheel before launch. \nNacon has also decided to cancel the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of Solar Crown “with the aim of making the most of the technology in the latest consoles.\" You can now pick up the game on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Solar Crown joins Gotham Knights as another cross-generation title to abandon its planned last-gen ports in favor of maximizing the current-gen experience. \nTest Drive Unlimited: Solar Crown was first unveiled in 2020 and is the first entry in the franchise since 2012's Test Drive: Ferrari Racing Legends (although the last Unlimited game was Unlimited 2 in 2011). The game tasks racing fans with aligning themselves with one of two clans, The Streets and The Sharps, to compete in races across an expansive Hong Kong Island. Outside of races, players can explore and expand the headquarters of their chosen faction. \n2022 has seen several high-profile titles get pushed into the following year.

The game’s 3v3 contests combine skating, racing, and a bit of rugby. Teams skate around a track carrying a ball to toss through a goal for points. You can also earn additional points based on the number of laps you complete. Maintaining possession of the ball requires players to rough each other up using tackle moves and other attacks. Roller Champions ups the ante on real-life roller derby by letting players skate up and along walls and perform other over-the-top moves. \n\n\nAs players rack up victories they’ll climb the ladder of a championship league to gain new stadiums, maps, and fans. Your Champion can be customized with unlockable items earned both in-game and through a season pass (dubbed a Roller Pass). A social hub fashioned as a skatepark allows friends and other players to meet up, practice, or indulge in mini-games. \nRoller Champions supports cross-play and cross-progression between PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC through the Ubisoft Store. The game is also playable on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S via backward compatibility. Ubisoft also plans to bring Roller Champions to Switch, Stadia, and Amazon Luna at a later date. \nRoller Champions was first announced during E3 2019 with a pre-alpha demo.

That’s because as the name implies, it takes place in the Hisui region of Pokémon, which debuted in Legends: Arceus. It’s the ancient version of the Sinnoh region and most people there aren’t too keen to live alongside Pokémon like the trainers we’ve all battled against in the mainline games. That discrepancy is at the heart of the first episode of Pokémon: Hisuian Snow, \"Onto the Icy Blue.\"\n“Across the Hisui region, many grow up believing people and Pokémon cannot live together,” the YouTube description for Episode 1 reads. “But when Alec meets a Hisuian Zorua, he may need to rethink how he views Pokémon.” \n\n\nWe won’t spoil here what happens, but you can check out the episode above. It’s a great start to Pokémon: Hisuian Snow and its beautiful art already has me on the lookout for the next episode. \nAfter watching it, read Game Informer’s Pokémon Legends: Arceus review and then read about the recent Daybreak update for the game. Check out the three starters for the next generation of Pokémon in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet after that. \nWhat did you think of Episode 1? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "Final Fantasy VII Remake director Tetsuya Nomura has revealed that Square Enix has news to share in regards to the Final Fantasy VII franchise next month. \nNomura said this in a Japanese live stream about Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier, a mobile battle royale, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. As for what this Final Fantasy VII news will be, it could theoretically be anything related to the franchise including The First Soldier, the original FFVII and its subsequent rereleases, Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis, or possibly (hopefully) news about Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2. \nThe last we heard about Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2 was that it could “differ significantly” from the original, which wouldn’t be surprising considering the changes and additions made in Final Fantasy VII Remake compared to the original game’s first handful of hours. In an ideal world, we hear about Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2 next month and then we hear about Final Fantasy XVI soon after, especially considering producer Naoki Yoshida recently revealed it’s near the end of development. \nAll of this would tie into a tease from a new Final Fantasy 35th Anniversary website that launched in March. It not only celebrates the series’ history, but teases information on upcoming titles, too. Upcoming titles could include Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 2, Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis, or even Final Fantasy XVI. Only time will for now. \nWhile waiting to learn more, read Game Informer’s Final Fantasy VII Remake review and then read about how Final Fantasy XVI has an “expansive” skill tree, according to its producer. Check out Game Informer’s ranking of every mainline Final Fantasy game after that. \n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]\nWhich Final Fantasy game in development are you most excited to hear about again?

Her cousin also happens to be Bruce Banner, AKA the Hulk. Walters gains a measure of the gamma radiation fueling Bruce to become a green powerhouse in her own right to smash evil in and out of the courtroom. The cast includes Mark Ruffalo, Jameela Jamill, and Tim Roth (reprising his role as Abomination). \n\n\nYou can also check out the official poster below:\nShe-Hulk made her comic debut in 1980 and, like her cousin, possesses superhuman strength, speed, stamina, healing, and durability. One of the most significant differences between Hulk and She-Hulk is that Jennifer largely retains her personality and intelligence while green, though usually with fewer inhibitions, as showcased at the end of the trailer. She’s traditionally portrayed as a skilled hand-to-hand fighter (trained by Captain America, among others), meaning she usually has far more finesse and is less destructive in a fight than Banner. Sometimes. \nShe-Hulk: Attorney at Law consists of nine episodes and premieres on August 17 on Disney+. It serves as the third Marvel TV series for 2022, following Moon Knight and the upcoming Ms. Marvel, which begins streaming in June. \nWhat do you think of this first look at She-Hulk?

This wild spin-off surgically removes Dead by Daylight’s terrifying killers and plops them into the romantic bubblegum world of dating sims.\nIf you’ve ever longed to court The Huntress after she brutally slaughtered you, Hooked on You: A Dead by Daylight Dating Sim is the game you’ve been waiting for. Launching later this year, this visual novel tasks would-be lovers to flirt their way into the hearts of four Killers: The Wraith, The Spirit, The Huntress, and The Trapper. Through choice-driven conversations, you’ll forge friendships or steamy relationships with these monsters to learn their personal histories and uncover the broader stories of what got them here in the first place. \n\n\n“You wanted it? You got it! Hooked on You: A Dead by Daylight Dating Sim mixes horror, humor and romance to create a fresh way for fans to interact and create an emotional bond with their favorite Killers,” says Mathieu Côté, Head of Partnerships for Dead by Daylight. “Our goal with our first visual novel is to provide fans with a completely unique and surprising new way to experience the world of Dead by Daylight.”\nHooked on You: A Dead by Daylight Dating Sim comes from Psyop, the team behind the equally silly KFC dating sim I Love You, Colonel Sanders! A Finger Lickin’ Good Dating Simulator. It doesn’t have a release date, but it’s coming to Steam sometime this summer.",

And for anyone who's not currently using Fortnite Wallet but is interested in it, you'll need to follow the step above and link your platform's account to Epic. Sadly, the Shared Wallet feature is still unavailable on Switch, so V-Bucks acquired on other platforms can't be transferred to Nintendo’s beloved handheld. \nV-Bucks are earned from the Battle Pass, Quest Packs, or Save the World game mode. Click the link above for the Fortnite Wallet FAQ and any additional information.\nIn other Fortnite news, Robocop, Scarlet Witch, and Maria \"Chica\" Lopez have all joined the battle royale fray this month.",

The event revealed three new games and a quick look at Eiyuden Chronicles: Rising. \nIt began with Among The Trolls, a new folklore survival game, then Stray Blade, a magic combat action RPG, and then a look at Eiyuden Chronicles: Rising, which was released last week, before ending with a quick tease of a game called Miasma Chronicles, developed by Mutant Year Zero developer The Bearded Ladies.\nLet’s break each of the new games down: \nAmong The Trolls\nThe trailer for Among The Trolls sets up this survival game as somewhat spooky, or at least mysterious.

          "description": "Things are ramping up for Take-Two Interactive as a new financial report details the publisher's IP plans for the next three years. According to Nintendo Life, many projects are in the works, from those already announced to undisclosed titles. Ultimately, the report revealed over 30 games are in the works, including, but not limited to, new ports and remasters. \nThe full report, which can be read here, categorizes the upcoming games and provides clear definitions for each:\nImmersive Core: Titles that have the deepest gameplay and the most hours of content. Examples include our key sports franchises (like PGA 2K and NBA 2K) as well as Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption (to name a few). \nIndependent: Externally developed Private Division releases. \nMobile: Any title released on a mobile platform.\nMid-core: Titles that are either an arcade title (like WWE Battlegrounds) or games that have many hours of gameplay, but not to the same extent as an immersive core title. \nNew iterations of prior releases: This includes ports and remastered titles. Sequels would not fall into this category.\nMoreover, a pipeline table in the document states Take-Two is developing 24 immersive core games, including The Quarry for June 10, Marvel's Midnight Suns later this year, Kerbal Space Program 2 (PC) in early 2023, and NBA2K23, PGA Tour 2K23, and WWE 2K23 next year. Ten independent games, 20 mobile games like the GTA Trilogy in 2023, 7 mid-core games, including the long-awaited Tales from the Borderlands sequel, and eight new iterations of prior releases are also on the way. Fans of Take-Two's many development studios undoubtedly have a lot to look forward to. \nIt's hard to guess the future for some of these categories, but what ports and remasters are you anticipating? Perhaps we'll get to play a modernized Bully port! Let us know what you're positing in the comments below! \n[Source: Nintendo Life]",

Developer Star Theory has delayed the game’s launch to early 2023.\nCreative director Nate Simpson explained on the project's forums and in a video message that designing the space flight simulator has “tremendous technological complexity” and the team needs more time to ensure its polish. In the video posted below, Simpson elaborates by saying: \n“We’ve also set ourselves a very high bar of quality. The game has to [perform] across a wide range of machines. The graphics have to be peerless. The universe has to be rich and interesting to explore. We’ve set ourselves the goal, internally, of creating an experience that is both original and breathtaking.” \n\n\nLike its well-received predecessor, Kerbal Space Program 2 tasks players with commanding a space program helmed by adorable green astronauts to construct rockets and other crafts to explore space. The game utilizes realistic physics to allow players to execute real-life orbital maneuvers used to locate and land upon celestial bodies. The sequel was first announced at Gamescom 2019 with a 2020 release window. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic delayed development and forced the team to aim for Fall 2021 instead. Of course, the game missed that window, too, and was most recently slated to arrive later this year. \nKerbal Space Program 2 is targeting PC at launch, with the console versions arriving later that year.\nUnfortunately, Kerbal isn't the only big game to get pushed to 2023. We recently compiled a list of every major 2022 title to slip out of the year that you can read here.",

But the news for Warner Bros.' brawler doesn't stop there. Three more characters were announced in a new cinematic trailer, and a timeframe for an upcoming open beta was revealed.\nLooney Toons' Taz, the Tazmanian Devil, spins onto the roster along with Scooby Doo's Velma and The Iron Giant from, well, The Iron Giant. All three characters appear for the first time in the trailer you can watch above, which has a host of unlikely WB characters like Batman and Shaggy teaming up to do battle with other surprising duos. Warner Bros. Games announced in a press release that Velma and Taz are playable in this week's alpha test as two members of a roster of 15 characters. It looks as if The Iron Giant won't make it into the current testing phase and is being saved for a later date.\nA later date like an open beta, perhaps? Along with the new trailer and characters comes the announcement of an open testing phase in July. So, if you're not able to get into the closed alpha, you'll only have to wait a handful of weeks to jump into the wacky fray. \nIf you are interested in trying out MultiVersus during the closed alpha that runs from May 19 through May 27, sign up for the chance to play on the game's website. MultiVersus is developed for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC with full cross-play and cross-progression systems built-in from the start.",
