There comes a time in each console's life when the games start to dry up and we look to the future, and the Switch is very much in the autumn of its years. Back in May, two months into its eighth year, Nintendo said a new hardware announcement is coming at some point before April next year, and with that acknowledgement comes a sense that the really good stuff will be saved to launch the next console with a bang.\nHowever, looking back at past Nintendo systems, it doesn't necessarily mean Switch will be running on fumes for the rest of the year. You would have been forgiven for thinking Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was the Switch's last hurrah, and then Super Mario Bros. Wonder turned up. You may have thought the release of Switch in 2017 meant that the might 3DS' days of quality exclusive software were numbered, but as we'll highlight below, that wasn't the case. In fact, Nintendo has good form when it comes to putting out brilliant games at the very end of a console's lifecycle and having sold over 140 million Switches, there's a high chance that there's still gold in them first-party hills, as well as all the third-party stuff we already know about.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

As of this week, I am seriously excited by tower defence, because Path Of The Goddess has captured my imagination. It's a stately, beautiful thing. I had a go at this year's Keighleycon, and it's one of two games at the show I wanted to carry on playing once my time was up.

I must now hang my head and await the executioner's ludicrously oversized hammer, for while Phantom Blade Zero's ambience and layouts owe something to From's work, the moment-to-moment has just as much in common with older hack-and-slash games such as Ninja Gaiden. I played a bit of it at Summer Game Fest this week, and while I’m not rushing out to preorder (I never am, in fairness), I think it could be a good ‘un.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Ten years ago, we were drowning in early access survival games about chopping trees and crafting camp fires. Rust pit monstrous players against one another, DayZ had us dashing around for beans and bleach, while The Forest creeped us the hell out in a dark jungle. There was even a week-long celebration here at RPS called survival week to get the genre out of our systems. A lot of those games have since graduated to a full 1.0 release, but one survivalist shambled on. 7 Days To Die is a solid sandbox craft 'em up with zombie hordes, and it never left the comfort of its early access log cabin surrounded by spikes and land mines. But a (tentative) release date is finally on the horizon, according to the developers. And it's quite soon.\nRead more",

For those of you only now noticing that tens of thousands of Twitch viewers have been religiously watching video game Hot Wheels, let me elucidate. Deep Dip 2 is a fan-made tower of racetracks that was published as a challenge to the racing game's community last month. It is 16 floors of unfathomably difficult ramps, tunnels, ledges, pipes, and beams. A simple mistake sees drivers plummeting to the bottom, like the sad cauldron man of Getting Over It. The first three players to finish would share a prize pool of over $32,000. Over the weekend, one player has now managed it, and another has since joined him. Third place is still up for grabs but, mate, I wouldn't recommend it.\nRead more",

You do get a party, drawn from a retinue of seven, larger-than-life, romanceable companions encompassing a range of classes, abilities and go-faster hairdos, but control of that party has been streamlined, and there's a God Of Warlike emphasis on booting Fade demons into pits.

The multi-limbed coffee shop owner of Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn is, indeed, a reassuring sight, since they are the ones who sell the player fashionable jackets and trousers to wear while you axe enemy heads to bloody fragments. In this soon-to-sally-forth soulslike from the makers of Ashen, the creature design is a highlight. Whether it's a good souls 'em up remains to be seen. I've only played a couple of hours in the Steam Next Fest demo. But I want to make clear that, among the reservations I've collected on my murder jaunt, nothing will diminish the espresso-pumping hand-haver of the game's first café.\nRead more",

          "description": "One of my absolute most favouritest Steam Deck cases, besides the one you get for free with the Steam Deck OLED, is the Dbrand Project Killswitch. It’s not so much a carrying vessel as a hardened second skin, providing protection without all the bag-hogging bulk of a traditional case – while throwing in handy bonuses like a clip-on kickstand and grippy thumbstick covers. For owners of the Asus ROG Ally, the recent launch of a Project Killswitch for their own handheld PC should therefore represent glad tidings with extra gladness, even if it won’t also fit the upcoming ROG Ally X.\nThank the new device’s bigger battery, wider SSD and reworked connection layout for that particular lack of forwards compatibility, as the ROG Ally X’s thicker dimensions will make it just slightly too beefy to slip into the Killswitch’s skintight silicone. A shame, but at least it makes a quality addition to the original Ally right this second. I’ve been manhandling one for a week now, and it’s just as practical and protective as the Steam Deck version.\nRead more",

          "description": "Computer Artworks' 2002 videogame adaptation of 1982 movie The Thing was a ghoulish and gripping third-person shooter with some terrific mechanics that weren't quite fleshed out, flesh being the operative word. For instance: you can enlist surviving soldiers as squadmates, but are they really surviving soldiers, or are they human-shaped warrens of teeth and mandibles poised to split open and shower you in digestive juices? You have a limited supply of blood tests with which to determine whether any people you rescue are Things in waiting - and even as you're worrying about them, they're casting suspicious eyes at you, care of some embryonic \"trust\" and \"fear\" systems.\nSadly, much of this acute paranoia could be easily gamed out in practice - back in 2002, I deduced that contact with enemies increased the odds of infection, and adopted a policy of shooting anyone who'd been in my squad for too long. But it's the kind of system an intelligent remake could pounce upon and have fun with. Sadly, Nightdive are not working on a remake, like their previous System Shock remakes. They've just announced that they're making a remaster, due later this year. Still, I will take a Thing remaster and thus, the opportunity to write more about The Thing, over no remaster at all.\n Read more",

Firstly, this game clearly contains a non-zero quantity of blades, from whacking great axes to katanas. Secondly, I do not accept the premise that these are phantom blades. They are very obviously non-spectral, going by the amount of stabbing and clanging on show in the video. With these potentially ruinous caveats out of the way, I am now free to tell you more about a game that looks like it's out to eat Sekiro's lunch.\r\n \nRead more",

Well now the Paldeck videos, released every weekend over on Twitter and YouTube, are providing deeper glimpses at some of those Pals.\n\n\nOn June 16, in what seems like a wonderful Father’s Day gift to Palworld-playing Dads everywhere, Pocketpair showed off one of the Pals which has become a secure fan favorite — Croajiro. \n\n\nMeet the newest water type Pal in Palworld, Croajiro\n\n\n\n\nIn the Paldeck video, the little frog-like creature, obviously a Water type Pal although it’s unknown whether it is a dual-type, can be seen facing off against another new Pal, Chillet Ignis. The Fire type Chillet Ignis was shown off yesterday, June 15, in the other of this weekend's Paldeck videos. \n\n\nIt’s nice to see that we’re finally being given sneak peaks rather than recaps of Pals we’ve already become very accustomed to, as all previous Paldeck videos have been for Pals which we already know and have likely captured. \n\n\nCroajiro's attacks\n\n\nImage via Pocketpair\n\n\nAmong the scenes in Croajiro’s Paldeck video were attacks which are very familiar from other Water type Pals, as well as what we can expect when Croajiro is petted. The best part of the Paldeck happened at the end, though, with Croajiro casually wielding its stick against four Mossanda, killing them effortlessly. I doubt it will be that easy in-game, but it’s a fun image.\n\n\nWe were given a sneak peak of the next Paldeck video, too. Next week, on June 24, we’ll find out more about Katress Ignis. Though we already know it’s a Fire type, I’m interested to see what else we may gather from the Paldeck.\n\nThe post Palworld: New Pal Croajiro showcased in the latest Paldeck video appeared first on Destructoid.",

This obvious glitch has fans on the hunt for these previously mediocre but now extremely valuable weapons.\n\n\nPickaxe spawns have been temporarily disabled\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nUnfortunately for players hoping to get some easy Legendary modules, this exploit was busting the economy of Fallout 76. Bethesda released a hotfix to temporarily disable Pickaxes from spawning in the world. This also means that if you have the blueprint to craft a Pickaxe, you’ll get a “lack the requirements” message when you try to make one.\n\n\nHowever, even after the hotfix, Pickaxes still appear in some locations, and they occasionally drop from Scorched enemies as well. Here are the places you’ll want to check out to find a Pickaxe after the hotfix:\n\n\n\nFoundation – Exterior\n\n\nGauley Mine\n\n\nGlassed Cavern\n\n\nNuka World On Tour – Tunnel of Love\n\n\n\nWhere to find Pickaxes in Fallout 76 normally\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nIf you want a Pickaxe because you’re a completionist and need to collect every weapon in the game, you might want to know all the places you can find them in normal circumstances. In addition to the above locations, Pickaxes usually spawn in the following areas:\n\n\n\nBlackwater Mine\n\n\nGarrahan Mining Headquarters\n\n\nGreg’s Mine Supply\n\n\nLucky Hole Mine\n\n\nMiners Monument\n\n\nTygart Wastewater Treatment Plant \n\n\n\nThough Pickaxes can currently still be found in Fallout 76 even after the hotfix, it’s only a matter of time before Bethesda notices the oversight and also disables those spawn locations or patches the Legendary module glitch. So if you’re hoping for some easy looting, you might want to hurry.\n\nThe post Where to find a Pickaxe in Fallout 76 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.\nJoin Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 1:00 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

          "description": "Developer-publisher Dragami Games has revealed that Lollipop Chainsaw RePop, its remaster of the 2012 zombie action game, will launch September 25 on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. Dragami revealed this release date in RePop's first trailer, which shows off some of the remastered gameplay and the characters players will meet in the game.  Lollipop Chainsaw represents a collaboration between Goichi \"Suda51\" Suda (No More Heroes, Killer7), and Guardians of the Galaxy director and now DC film head James Gunn. At the time of Lollipop Chainsaw's release, Gunn was known primarily for directing the films Slither and Super, and writing the two live-action Scooby Doo films and Zach Snyder's Dawn of the Dead remake. We spoke with Suda51 recently about his career and whether or not he keeps up with James Gunn.\nAlongside the trailer, Dragami has also released various details related to the remaster of Chainsaw Lollipop, including word that PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC players can enjoy the game with 4K resolution and 60 FPS (the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch versions support 1080p resolution and 30 FPS). Dragami says RePop has shorter load times, improved camera and keystroke response, increased attack speed, and faster movement speed, too. \nPlus, the Chainsaw Blaster now has \"auto rock on,\" an auto-fire mode, and an increased maximum ammunition count, while combos are now usable from the start of the game. Nick Roulette has received some changes, and so have minigames. Plus, a new auto-QTE feature is on by default now. \nCheck all of it out for yourself in the Chainsaw Lollipop RePop gameplay trailer below: \n\n\nLollipop Chainsaw RePop will be available on September 25 for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. \n For more, read Game Informer's original Lollipop Chainsaw review here. \nAre you going to be playing Chainsaw Lollipop RePop this September?

Currently, you can only use Discord on PS5 after first joining a voice chat group via a PC or phone, which is quite a cumbersome step to take in order to talk with friends while gaming. \nThe update will gradually roll out to PS5 players in the coming weeks, starting first with Japan and Asia, followed by Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and the Middle East, and finally, North and South America. You will need to update your console to the latest system software and link your PlayStation Network and Discord accounts in order to take advantage of this upcoming feature. \n\n\nTo start a Discord voice chat directly from a PS5, players need to select the Discord tab in the Control Center's Game Base. Here, choose a Discord server or DM group you'd like to join, select your preferred voice channel, and you're set. You will receive a notification when another Discord user calls you, too, allowing you to join immediately. \nThis upcoming update will arrive more than two years after PlayStation gave players the ability to link their PSN accounts to Discord back in 2021. \nAre you excited about this update?

Across its 30 years of existence as a franchise, there have been 17 games, though what is now the Mana series today actually began as Final Fantasy Adventure in 1991.\nIn the trailer, we get a look at the five playable characters, including Soul Guard Val (voiced by Stephen Fu), Oracle of Wind Careena (voiced by Rachel Rial), Radiant Sword Morley, (voiced by Kaiji Tang), Queen of the Deep Palamena (voiced by Vanessa Lemonides), and Woodland Custodian Julei (voiced by Amber Aviles). Players can swap these characters in and out to create three-person parties and can change each character's class to attune to different elements. They won't be alone, though, as non-player companions can assist the player's party in combat, according to the trailer. \nCheck out the Visions of Mana release date trailer for yourself below:\n\n\nThe standard edition of Visions of Mana will cost $59.99, but there is a Collector's Edition for $199.99 that features a Ramcoh plush, the Art of Mana special issue, a Visions of Mana original soundtrack collector's edition special box, and of course, the physical game. However, Square Enix says the PlayStation 4 standard and collector's edition will not be available in the U.S. \nHere's a look at the Visions of Mana Collector's Edition: \nVisions of Mana hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on August 29. \nFor more about the game, watch the Visions of Mana reveal trailer, and then check out this gameplay trailer from earlier this year. \nAre you going to be playing Visions of Mana this August?

Set to premiere in November, show creators Christian Linke and Alex Yee confirm the upcoming season will be the show's last.\n\n\nSeason 2 is billed as \"the final chapter\" and will center on Jinx's attack on the Council, which will be the centerpiece of the escalating Piltover/Zaun conflict.

While Arcane will conclude, Christian Link stated during a League of Legends dev update today that it won't be the last animated tale based on the franchise. \n“Arcane is just the beginning of our larger storytelling journey and partnership with the wonderful animation studio that is Fortiche,\" said Linke. \"From the very beginning, since we started working on this project, we had a very specific ending in mind, which means the story of Arcane wraps up with this second season.

The open-world scoundrel game shows protagonist Kay Vess, a thief looking to start a new life, trying to hunt down a gunslinger to learn her talents. This takes her from a space station marketplace to Tatooine's iconic Mos Eisley. \nThe 10-minute guided walkthrough focuses on one aspect of Outlaws, which is tracking down elusive experts in order to learn their craft. From being the fastest draw in the galaxy to mastering sleight of hand, these skills will help Kay go from a common (though wanted) thief to a legendary outlaw. The video shows off the seamless ground-to-ship gameplay, one of the optional space dogfights you can engage in, speeder bike gameplay across the sands of Tatooine, as well as stealth and shootout sequences. \n\n\nIf you'd like a more condensed summary of what Star Wars Outlaws entails, another trailer serves as a shorter tour through some of the planets players will visit, the characters they'll meet, the systems at play, and a glimpse into some story moments. \n\n\nStar Wars Outlaws launches on August 30 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

          "description": "In a universe where bagels meet bars, the BAGEL engine has been perfectly toasted, and the ScummVM team is now ready to serve a slice of The Space Bar nostalgia. No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.\nThis is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.\nIf you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.\nNow, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)\n>",
