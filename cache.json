          "description": "Blood-meltingly beautiful.\nTsukihime is responsible for a lot of things. Back in 2000, Type-Moon’s classic visual novel captivated audiences with a story crammed full of occult mystery, thrilling action, and heart-pounding character drama. Like jagged lines splintering out of a unified core, its success spread out in many different directions: adaptations across manga and anime, the production of a number of sequel VNs, the birth of Type-Moon’s mega-popular Fate franchise, and, of course, the creation of its very own fighting game series Melty Blood. It’s no stretch to say that Tsukihime is a cornerstone of the industry, which is exactly why the title’s fade into relative obscurity is such a surprise.\nFor all the waves it made in the time during and after its release, Tsukihime has never been graced with an official Western localization. Moreover, the original Japanese release has long since become abandonware, with the task of preserving the game online falling to diehard fans. Suffice to say, it’s not the fate that a game many champion as one of the best in its genre deserves. Fortunately, Type-Moon has seen fit to rectify that problem by way of a full-on remake project.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Past masters.\nWe often use the word 'evergreen' to describe a game which never gets old. Despite the passage of time, there's a stratum of untouchables that still feel as vital in the hands as the day they were released. Personal preferences and nostalgia will always, always come into play, but games like Super Mario Bros. 3 or Super Mario World? It's hard to imagine them feeling any better if they launched yesterday.\nCritical consensus puts classics like those on a pedestal which seems precarious — they can't be that good, right? — but whenever you return, they do, somehow, stand up. You settle back and relax, relieved. You need never worry that a quick blast through SMB3 won't live up to your expectations.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

So now the rest of us can join Edwin in becoming entranced by the swirling colours of this sword-swinger.\nRead more",

The little spinning symbol cautioning players against impatient acts of powering down. \"Don't turn off your system when this symbol is displayed,\" goes the message seen often while booting up a game (or some other version of these words). The implication is clear. The saving process is delicate and if you interrupt this invisible ritual the data that's being written to some folder deep in your PC's innards will become corrupted, wrecked, banjaxed. You will lose all your progress, all your precious swords and accomplishments.\nBut is this true? How likely are you to really suffer a catastrophic loss of shotgun shells? To find out, I decided to spend a very annoying afternoon of turning my gaming rig off and on again during multiple games. Was this a good idea? I don't know.

But no seriously, I think no matter if it's a bit Soulsy or not, my key takeaway is one of relief. There's a lot more substance to back up the style than I thought there would be, alongside it feeling a lot more compact than the behemoth I envisioned in my head.

          "description": "Let me continue the theme from our round-up of Steam sale reccs for under a tenner, while exchanging the concept of money for the concept of time: what can you do in celebrated open world \"anecdote generator\" Dragon's Dogma 2 in two hours or less? Two hours being the length of the free Dragon's Dogma 2 trial that is now live on Steam. For context, this is approximately how much time Capcom gave me to preview their latest action-RPG, many headline cycles ago. During that brief window, I managed to become the worst wizard in Dragon's Dogma 2, but I know you can go further. I'm so confident of this, in fact, that I'm going to start feeling all insecure and hurt in anticipation. How could you trample on my feelings so?\n Read more",

In the latest episode, they're discussing their (relatively new) Boston studio and how it's spearheading the as-yet-enigmatic sequel to Cyberpunk 2077. There's a lot of middle-managey chit chat but one thing that stood out was one developer's earnest remarks about what he considers some of the sci-fi RPG's shortcomings. \n\"I see that we didn't push the envelope far enough in some places, for instance,\" said Paweł Sasko, Associate Game Director at CD Project RED.  \"Like, let's say the homeless crisis... when I look at it, I'm like, we weren't far enough in '77.

          "description": "Besides giving The First Descendant the ol’ benchy marks on desktop, I was curious to see how this gleaming looter shooter would run on the less flexing hardware of the Steam Deck. The answer: it didn’t, at first. Luckily, a semi-quick fix was enough to get me in, where I found a game that for all its ray tracing inclinations, is comfortable with life on the Deck. Reasonably. Most of the time.\nWith any luck, my issue could be purged completely by the time The First Descendant releases on July 2nd. Partly because I was using a technically non-final preview build, and partly because the problem itself was a silly one: launching was blocked by a case of missing Visual C++, something that the Steam Deck’s Proton compatibility witchcraft usually takes care of. Come on, Proton lad, you’re kinda dropping the ball here.\nIf this ever happens to you, in The First Descendant or any other game, I heartily recommend YouTuber JD Ros’ video tutorial on fixing it. The method boils down to installing the latest C++ versions via the Steam Deck’s Desktop Mode, then adding their executables to the game’s launch options. This worked a treat for me, and I didn’t suffer any further compatibility headaches from there on out.\n Read more",

Paradox talk about this and other upcoming changes (including a new start date) in an update post on Steam. Some rulers among you will be excited by all the Byzantine bureaucracy that will headline the DLC. But real kings care about filtering information in extremely picky detail.

The downside there, as a few people have pointed out, is that some players don't want to hunt for collectibles before they can topple the bosses.\n Read more",

          "description": "Update: Whelp, spoke too soon. Apparently some Steam Deck players are seeing an \"Innapropriate activity detected\" message upon launching Elden Ring, blocking them from playing online. I haven't had this myself, and some have reported the issue fixing itself after they installed the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, but hopefully there's a proper patch in the works.\nElden Ring on the Steam Deck has long enjoyed a smoothness that desktop play has lacked. Not so much in simple framerate terms – the handheld spends far more time around the 30fps mark than it does bumping into Elden Ring’s 60fps cap – but thanks to a Proton compatibility update back in 2022, it’s drastically less prone to the flow-breaking stutter that still plagues the RPG in 2024. That now goes for Shadow Of The Erdtree as well, judging from my portable time in the new expansion.\nRead more",

          "description": "A phoenix is a mythological firebird that is periodically reborn from its own ashes, a symbol of cyclical renewal. It's also, according to several former employees of Chorus developers Fishlabs in Hamburg, an internal title for the massive cost-cutting project begun by Swedish conglomerate Embracer Group in June 2023.\nThe current incarnation of a bewildering series of mergers, renamings and acquisitions that date back to the founding of Nordic Games in 2004, Embracer have spent much of the past decade buying up video game studios and licenses, from Deus Ex developers Eidos Montreal to the adaptation rights for The Lords Of The Rings. According to a February 2023 earnings report, by the end of December 2022 the conglomerate had 134 internal studios on the books (including table-top developers) and owned or controlled over 850 IPs, with 224 games in development. Our Graham warned of the perils of such consolidation in 2019, and his misgivings have been borne out. Following the reported collapse of a billion dollar Savvy Games investment deal, Embracer set out to recover their debts by cancelling projects, laying off staff and closing whole studios. Fishlabs - acquired by Embracer in 2018 alongside their parent company Koch Media, nowadays Plaion - were among those burned by \"Project Phoenix\", first losing a dozen people in September 2023, and then around half their remaining workforce in November. In the process of these reductions, Embracer also binned off two video game projects – a sumptuous sci-fi metroidvania that was in full development, and a \"visual prototype\" for a brand new Red Faction game.\n  \nRead more",

Yes, I know the pirate republic was a real thing, ended not by the infighting and treachery shown here, but by the British.

          "description": "Prázdniny začínají a nebastlíři leží na plážích nebo se vystavují nebezpečnému UV záření mimo kontrolované prostředí laboratoře. Strahováci však stále sledují, co se děje nového ve světě techniky a v pondělí se novinkám na Virtuální Bastlírně podívají na zoubek.\r\n\r\nAltium změnilo licenční model, což způsobilo vlnu nevole. KiCADu v posledních verzích postupně přibývá podpora importu z Altia - nahrálo Altium nechtěně do karet KiCADu? Co ale ze světa hardwaru?\r\n\r\nLilyGO začíná prodávat levné \"chytré\" brýle s ESP32. Z Číny se dají kooupit procesory s BT 5.0 pod dolar. Vznikla open-source aktivní sonda do 2 GHz - zmíní i jak se dělají kabely k osciloskopickým sondám. Nedávno také bastlíři vyzkoušeli Faradayův jev v oleji a mají i video. Nesmí ale zapomínat i na software.\r\n\r\nKromě nové verze KiCADu si můžeme ukázat drobné zlepšováky pro LTSpice - import bloků s S-parametry nebo export schémat do pěkné prezentovatelné podoby. Nově vznikl i fork AR488 podporující ethernet místo USB připojení. Nezapomínají však ani na naše oblíbená úsměvná až bizarní témata!\r\n\r\nZměna licence zřejmě konečně po 20+ letech umožnila Altiu zprovoznit podporu pro jednovrstvé plošné spoje. Adam H. na dovolené hackuje RFID zámky (ale o tom více poví osobně až někdy příště). Na zubních kartáčcích s ESP32 se šíří botnet. Vzniká český vesmírný program (bohužel se nejmenuje Kosmo) a vznikla podpora pro psaní programů v .NETu na prehistorickou konzoli NES/Famicom.\r\n\r\nJak vidíte, seznam zajímavých témat na tento měsíc je vskutku obsáhlý. Neváhejte tedy, nažhavte svoje počítače, repráky, mikrofony a kamery a připojte se s námi na Virtuální Bastlírnu XL. Nejde však o velikost, jen o pořadové číslo 40 - VB je tu pro všechny nezávisle na velikosti, věku či čemkoliv jiném.\r\n\r\nPříští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v pondělí 1. července od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

One of today's had TheRetroRunner taking on a Low% run of Ninja Gaiden on NES, and the fact that it nearly ended in defeat really showcases what makes these events special in the first place.\n\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the Low% category for Ninja Gaiden — I had never seen it before myself — it's essentially a sword-only run with some key restrictions. While it's okay if you pick up a few items by accident, you can't use them on enemies and you can't pick up anything that automatically activates. That means no fire wheel, no time stopping, and no health potions. \n\n\nThankfully, TheRetroRunner and others who run this category have plenty of tricks up their sleeves. …",

          "description": "Consumer Softproducts has released a 9-minute-ish compilation of Psycho Patrol R gameplay snippets onto YouTube today. If you were wondering how much like Cruelty Squad the new game would be; it’s looking like a lot.\n\n\nIt’s really hard to tell if this is a rough cut from a still-in-development game or if this is actually what things are going to be like. It’s hard to tell after you’ve played Cruelty Squad.\n\n\nIt does show off things like swearing for some reason, as well as mech fights and mech customization. In Psycho Patrol R, you sometimes pilot your V-Stalker Mecha. Other times, you do not. But when you do, you can swap out the guns on its left and right arms, as well as its crotch.\n\n\n\n\nThe compilation also shows off rappelling down a building, which looks pretty neat. You’re also followed by a floating ball with stars around it (Bion?).\n\n\nIt looks enjoyable, but it’s really hard to describe why. Cruelty Squad was one of the most difficult games for me to review. I absolutely like the game, but trying to describe it makes it sound horrible. The graphics look like the sort of dream that Windows Me wakes up screaming from, and the music is like the game accidentally loaded the wrong sound file, was embarrassed, and spontaneously began remixing it instead of admitting to its mistake. The narrative and gameplay only sort of make sense. It’s incredibly uncomfortable to play, and it feels like it hates the player. But you should definitely play it.\n\n\nPsycho Patrol R looks like it’s going to be the same. I look forward to when it releases, which could be anytime between tomorrow and 10 years from now. It’s really hard to tell how close to completion it is based on the video.\n\n\nPsycho Patrol R doesn’t have a set release window, but it is planned for PC.\n\nThe post Cruelty Squad dev shows off Psycho Patrol R gameplay compilation, excruciating jank-pop stylings appeared first on Destructoid.",

Here's how to fix the error code 0x87DD0033 on Xbox.\n\n\nXbox 0x87DD0033 error code solution\n\n\nThe Xbox 0x87DD0033 error code occurs during a server outage or when experiencing a connection issue. Currently, the Xbox Status page has revealed a major outage for the Account and profile section. Multiple users have also indicated that they are encountering the error on Down Detector. That means you won't be able to log in until the servers have cleared up.\n\n\nFortunately, the Xbox Support page is aware of the issue and has confirmed that they are looking into the error code:\n\n\n\n\nThe Support page also recently concluded service maintenance for Destiny 2, which may have something to do with the error code. We'll just have to wait and see how long it takes to clear out the entire network for it to work properly. It's best to keep track of this on the Xbox Status page, which provides the current status of various platforms. \n\n\nScreenshot via Xbox Support\n\n\nIf the servers are running, you may need to check your internet connection. You'll need to ensure that the connection is stable in order to clear up the 0x87DD0033 issue. Most online games, like The First Descendant, won't allow you to play them unless you are signed into Xbox. So, you'll need to clear up any internet issues beforehand to get it up and running.\n\n\nWe'll be sure to update this guide once the Xbox Live servers are working again.\n\nThe post How to fix 0x87DD0033 error code on Xbox appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Bugs and errors in video games and live service platforms can catch you by surprise, especially if there's seemingly no way to fix the issue. Occasionally, Xbox will encounter server-wide errors that affect thousands, potentially millions of players, with a fix taking some time to appear. In the meantime, you can check Xbox's server status to see if it's a server-side problem or a client-side issue you can fix within minutes.\n\n\nHow to check Xbox server status\n\n\nThe two main ways to check Xbox's server status is to view the official Xbox Status support page, social media such as the Xbox Support X account, or third-party sites like Downdetector if you suspect the support page isn't up-to-date. More often than not, at least one of these resources will reveal issues with Xbox's services, with specific categories such as account and login problems, cloud gaming bugs, or store and subscription errors, if any exist.\n\n\nIn most cases, you'll have to wait until Microsoft resolves these issues. Occasionally, the solution is as easy as restarting your Xbox, turning your router on and off, or double-checking your Xbox account to see if it's an account-related problem. However, the most common situation is that it's a server-side error on Xbox's end that Microsoft has to step in and fix before you can play your games again. \n\n\nIf Xbox's server status pages show that everything is operational, there's a chance your error or issue is a game-specific bug or an issue with your console. In this case, you may have to run some troubleshooting with your Xbox, such as seeing if it's a hardware issue or diving into a particular game's server status to see if the error only impacts one or two games.\n\nThe post Are Xbox services down?

Between the Pale Heart weapons and their powerful Origin Trait, and the Salvation's Edge weapons, there's plenty to play with. \n\n\nI've been running three separate Pale Heart weapons for that crispy Super regen on my Prismatic Warlock as one great example. One weapon is quite useful but can be hard to get good stats for. Here's the god roll for the Lost Signal grenade launcher in Destiny 2, including the best perks and attachments.\n\n\nThe best perks, barrel, and magazine for the Lost Signal grenade launcher in Destiny 2\n\n\nThe Lost Signal is particularly interesting. For one, it's acquired through Echo Engrams which only house a specific set of weapons. However, it also sports the new Area Denial Frame which launches grenades in a burst. These leave small areas that damage enemies that step inside it, similar to the Witherhoard. All of this makes it a great weapon for quickly dealing with hordes of ads, and two perks along with some attachments can make great use of that. Those are as follows:\n\n\n\nBarrel: Hard Launch\n\n\nMagazine: High-Velocity Reserves\n\n\nPerk 1: Auto-Loading Holster\n\n\nPerk 2: One For All\n\n\n\nIf you know your attachments well, you may be wondering what the reason is for Hard Launch. Well, stats like Blast Radius don't affect the Area Denial Frame on Grenade Launchers, so the size of these areas should remain the same while greatly increasing the projectile speed. High-Velocity Rounds further increase the grenade's projectile speed, making it much more consistent.

          "description": "Logging onto a game you're excited to play only to experience bugs or connection issues is never fun. The First Descendant has also fallen victim to this, with various errors appearing as you log in or teleport to areas in the game. Fortunately, Nexon has actively worked on these issues, and there are ways to check its server status to see if the error you're facing is client-side, server-side, or completely unrelated. \n\n\nHow to check The First Descendant server status\n\n\nThe First Descendant has numerous ways to check its server status, from its official X (Twitter) page to its Discord server. However, the most reliable way to stay up-to-date on current issues is The First Descendant's news page, where Nexon actively reports on patch notices, urgent errors, and other important details. You can also view this page for information on upcoming events and features.\n\n\nCurrently, The First Descendant's servers are online, with Nexon resolving several beta and launch issues shortly after its release. Over time, more patches will continue to be released in updates, which may cause some downtime if they're major fixes or ones that require server reboots. \n\n\nHowever, there may occasionally be times when it is not The First Descendant's fault at all. For example, if you're playing on consoles, you may experience Xbox server errors instead, which are completely unrelated to specific games. In such situations, you'll have to wait for your PC or console's services to return before logging into The First Descendant or other games you're interested in playing.\n\nThe post Is The First Descendant down?

It might be for the different stats or weapon types, but without a doubt, your inventory will fill up fast. \n\n\nWith all this in mind, you might find it helpful to store some weapons you don't need to have on you at all times. Here's how to store gear in The First Descendant.\n\n\nHow to put gear in your personal storage in The First Descendant\n\n\nImage via Destructoid.\n\n\nTo store gear, you want to travel to the main hub of Albion if you aren't there already. Once there, turn immediately to the right and you should see a big box on legs that you can interact with. Once you speak to it, you'll get access to your Storage screen, where you can see anything you've already stored away. If you're reading this guide though, this Storage should be empty. Tab over to the Inventory screen to access the items on your person.\n\n\nFrom there, it's as simple as clicking on the piece of gear you want to store and it'll automatically get moved over to Storage. You may not want to put stuff in storage early in your time with The First Descendant, but later on, this menu should prove invaluable.\n\n\nCan you increase the space in your personal storage?\n\n\nIt is possible to increase the space in your personal storage, but this comes with a huge caveat. Each storage space costs 25 of the game's premium currency Caliber. This can be earned in-game, but as expected, it's extremely rare and in small quantities. Either way, your personal storage can be increased by an additional 1000 slots from the standard 76.\n\nThe post How to store gear in The First Descendant appeared first on Destructoid.",

Past those which are part of the MSQ, there are two more to unlock once you’ve reached level 100 and you’ll need them if you want to play Duty Roulette: Expert. \n\n\nIf you loved Shadowbringers and the mechanics it introduced, you’re going to really enjoy Tender Valley.

Pick up the level 100 blue side quest ‘It Belongs in a Museum’, then you’re going to have to head to Shaaloani, because what better place to take on a whole troop of sentient Cacti with murderous intent?\n\n\nSpeak to Zeycihan again, and then head into Tender Valley to do what his hired group of mercenaries couldn’t - explore the ruins, overcome the enemies you find within and discover the hidden secrets of the ruins. \n\n\nLike I said, some of the mechanics in here will be joyfully familiar to you, including a direct recreation of the first fight within the Qitana Ravel. Others will be more unfamiliar, but they’re easy to get to grips with as long as you pay close attention to tiny, needle-like details.\n\nThe post How to unlock Tender Valley in FFXIV, Dawntrail Expert Roulette appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Right before Christmas 2022, developer Bulwark Studios and publisher Kasedo Games released a Sci-Fi city-builder titled IXION on Steam. I admittedly knew little about the game, but as a fan of Warhammer 40K: Mechanicus, a tactical strategy game by the same duo, I decided to give it a shot. It ended up being one of my favorite games of 2022, and the city builder is now set to hit PS5 and Xbox Series X|S in early 2025.\n\n\n\n\nIn IXION, players take on the role of the Administrator of the Tiqqun, a prototype space station built by one of the most powerful and influential companies on Earth, DOLOS. An unexpected cataclysmic event occurs and the station suddenly becomes humanity's last bastion of survival as it soars through space. It's rare to see a quality story in a city-builder, but IXION's is top-notch especially for fans of science fiction. \n\n\nAs you progress through IXION you'll not only unlock more building elements and features, but learn more about the stations creators, the cataclysmic event that occurred, and more while also making decisions that will affect the human race in its entirety. The only other game I can really think of to compare it to is Frostpunk in that you'll often be tasked with making tough decisions that you think are the best in the moment.\n\n\nI'll admit, I'm not entirely convinced that a more intricate city builder like IXION will feel quite as intuitive on a controller as opposed to a keyboard and mouse. But with how much IXION  continuously surprised me when I played through it, I'm confident that if anyone can pull it off it's Bulwark Studios.\n\n\nIXION is scheduled to release on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S in Q1 2025. It's currently available on PC via Steam.\n\nThe post One of the best Sci-Fi city builders on Steam is headed to consoles appeared first on Destructoid.",

These instructions from Super Earth help us beat the factions fighting against managed democracy in the Second Galactic War, but lately, they've been a chaotic mess. \n\n\nThe current Major Order has Helldivers 2 players frantically spreading themselves across five alien worlds in an attempt to liberate them in the name of Super Earth. This has been far from straightforward, though, with many planets in sectors across the galaxy also requiring players to defend them lest they be overtaken by the bugs or bots, so it's all felt stressful. However, the community has come together brilliantly to complete this Major Order against all odds and organize themselves multiple times a day. \n\n\nManaged democracy …",

          "description": "Leveling up your mastery rank in The First Descendant is key to increasing your module capacity, inventory space, and other important character components. You'll also gain unique new features, from ability enhancements to specific locations and weapon readjustment. Here's how to gain mastery experience points and rank up your mastery to take advantage of these buffs.\n\n\nHow to gain Mastery points in The First Descendant\n\n\nYou'll obtain mastery experience points as you play The First Descendant. You gain mastery EXP over time as you complete missions for the first time, increase your weapon proficiency, and raise your character's level. You can find your progress toward your next mastery level in your inventory menu, just below your character level.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nGenerally speaking, defeating monsters or repeating the same missions won't net you mastery points. Instead, focus on using various weapon types and obtaining first-time completion rewards for missions if you want to max out your mastery.\n\n\nHow to rank up Mastery level in The First Descendant\n\n\nIncreasing your mastery rank requires returning to Albion and visiting Prime Hands, the Arche Factor Manipulator. You can find Prime Hands in the eastern portion of Albion, near the mailbox and Special Operations Terminal. When you max out your first mastery level, you'll receive a quest to visit Prime Hands, highlighting its location on your map.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nOnce you locate Prime Hands, select Mastery Rank Up to read up on the game's guide on mastery. In short, it'll tell you about mastery rank EXP and the benefits you receive from levels. After reading it, confirm your rank up to reach your next mastery level.\n\nThe post How to rank up Mastery in The First Descendant appeared first on Destructoid.",

In this case, there are two new level 100 dungeons to unlock which will eventually become those which can be taken part in through Duty Roulette: Leveling. \n\n\nIf you’ve ever thought “hey, this dungeon seems pretty tame, the scenery isn’t attacking me or anything”, then the Strayborough Deadwalk is absolutely the dungeon for you. If you want my advice, don’t stop to smell the roses and absolutely don’t stop to appreciate the backdrop - it attacks, and it hurts. \n\n\nUnlock the Strayborough Deadwalk, Dawntrail Expert Roulette\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nOnce you’ve completed the MSQ, including the final level 100 quest ‘Dawntrail’, head on back to Solution Nine and talk to Nostalgia outside the entrance to the Backrooms (X:19.8, Y:17.1). She’ll have a level 100 quest for you to pick up called ‘Something Stray in the Neighborhood’. \n\n\nThis is the quest which will eventually reward you with The Strayborough Deadwalk, but you need to complete a few steps first, beginning with traveling to Living Memory. Wait at the designated location and talk with Nostalgia again, before heading off to find Constancy below the Ferris Wheel in Yesterland. \n\n\nSomehow, he’s still there and tells you about a lost borough of Living Memory, which can suddenly be accessed through a tear in the fabric of reality.

And it continues to look like a scary new addition to the A Quiet Place movie universe. \nThough there's still no release date – it's launching sometime this year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC – this story trailer reveals more about the state of the world in The Road Ahead. It seemingly begins on Day One, when the aliens, which possess incredible hearing that requires people to remain silent to survive, attack Earth. It then jumps ahead to Day 105, with Alex, an asthmatic college student trying to survive the end of the world with her boyfriend Martin, on the hunt for supplies and more. \nCheck it out for yourself in the story trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead below: \n\n\nAs you can see, it seems Alex might be pregnant, which, if you've seen the first A Quiet Place movie, can make trying to remain silent in this world quite difficult. We'll have to wait a little longer to find out how the story of A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead plays out because it launches later this year on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. \nFor more about the game, watch the reveal trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead. \nAre you excited for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead?

As for why, the team wants to give its spiritual cousin, Life Is Strange: Double Exposure, some space to shine later this year. \nLost Records was originally due out in late 2024, which is also when the next Life is Strange is set to launch. Instead of competing with Life Is Strange, a series that Don't Nod created with the first Life Is Strange and continued with Life Is Strange 2 before Double Exposure developer Deck Nine took over with 2017's Before the Storm and 2021's True Colors, the studio decided to push to 2025. \nWe've made the decision to move the release dates of Lost Records: Bloom & Rage to early 2025. We know you're all excited for both Lost Records and the new Life is Strange game, and we wanted to ensure both have adequate space to shine. The wait will be worth it! pic.twitter.com/PH1O7z3uUy\nJune 28, 2024\nLife Is Strange: Double Exposure launches October 29, and now, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, which will be released in two parts, will launch sometime early next year. Both games are set to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. \nIn the meantime, watch the reveal trailer for Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, and then watch the Life Is Strange: Double Exposure reveal trailer.

Robust enough, even, that BioWare used it to create most of the NPCs in the game, save for mainline characters like companions. Setting hyperbole aside, it is a staggeringly rich creation system, and I look forward to seeing player-created near-replicas of celebrities and monstrous creations that'd be more at home in a horror game. \nBut I'm also looking forward to the community's reaction to the Dragon Age series' best character creator yet.

Originally slated to launch next month on July 25, the upcoming narrative-driven city-builder is now arriving on September 20.\nDeveloper 11 Bit Studios sates that following a recent beta, the team wants to take extra time addressing feedback to ensure the best possible experience. In a press release, design director Jakub Stokalski and art director Lukasz Juszczyk issued the following statement:\n“Based on the surveys we received after playing Beta, the average rating you gave us was 8 out of 10. We’re super grateful for that! At the same time, it was only a small slice of a work-in-progress, still-growing game. While our backlog is plentiful, it was an opportunity for us to listen to what you enjoyed, and what didn’t quite land yet”. \n“This allowed us to prioritise things better, and bring upfront the features and modifications we were already working on. But we also realised that to guarantee the best possible experience on launch, we need more time to finish the development of Frostpunk 2. That’s why we made the difficult decision to postpone its release to September 20th, 2024”.\n11 Bit States that it plans to work on new additions to existing game mechanics and improve the UI and UX, among other things. \nFrostpunk 2 will launch first for PC on September 20. PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions are planned to arrive later. We recently played the game, and you can read our extensive preview here.",

More specifically, it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam) on August 1, and it brings with it updated visuals and controls and a new skin that harkens back to the original game's most infamous easter egg. \nIn the reveal trailer, we get a look at the graphical improvements Aspyr has implemented in Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, but the game still retains that 2002 PlayStation 2 and GameCube charm. This re-release follows a limited PlayStation 4 physical run that launched back in 2019. \nCheck out the Star Wars: Bounty Hunter announcement trailer below: \n\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, you play as Jango Fett throughout the story, which itself is a prequel to Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. \nIn the original game, there was an easter egg message that said, \"Cash in all bounties to play as Boba.\" However, cashing in all bounties did not let you play as Boba. To make good on that original promise from 2002, Aspyr media has included a Boba Fett skin in Star Wars: Bounty Hunters you can use after completing the game's campaign. \nStar Wars: Bounty Hunter hits PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on August 1. \nWhile waiting for its launch, check out this lengthy gameplay demo of Star Wars Outlaws, another mercenary-centric Star Wars game launching this year.

Though the once previously Xbox-exclusive game has since made its way to PlayStation and PC platforms, it remains unclear which platforms this remaster is coming to. And there's no word on when to expect the remaster either. \nRevealed with a short 47-second teaser trailer, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster looks great, almost more like a remake than a remaster. It's unclear if this is a remaster of the original 2006 game or the HD version of Dead Rising that launched on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC back in 2017.

          "description": "The one and only Elden Ring expansion we're getting, Shadow of the Erdtree, launched last week and thousands of Tarnished went to the shadow realm to take on dozens of new enemies, bosses, and more. Now, just a few days later, developer From Software has released a new patch for the game that should make Shadow of the Erdtree a bit easier. \nNow live, Calibration Update 1.12.2 targets the scaling of the attack and damage negation given to players with each Shadow Realm Blessing upgrade. Here's what's changed: \nThe attack and damage negation has been increased for the first half of the maximum amount of Blessing enhancements, and the second half will now be more gradual. \nThe attack and damage negation granted by the final level of Blessing enhancements has been slightly increased. \n\n\nThis patch should apply automatically like any other Elden Ring update but if it doesn't – the Calibration Version listed at the bottom right reads \"1.12.2\" if it has – select \"LOGIN\" and that will apply the latest version of the game. \nThe only other thing this update contains is word from From Software on a confirmed bug where the raytracing settings of Shadow of the Erdtree are automatically enabled (if you've previously loaded save data from previous game versions), which is causing framerate issues for some players. If you're encountering said issues, check to see if you have raytracing on or off in the game's system graphical settings. \nThis patch arrives after one that hit the game last week, which added new hairtsyles, inventory features, balance adjustments, and more to Elden Ring ahead of Shadow of the Erdtree's launch. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review, and then check out this interview where From Software's Hidetaka Miyazaki discusses his approach to difficulty in games. \nWhat do you think of this update?

In a surprise announcement in a video Dunkey released yesterday, Bigmode revealed the next game it is publishing: Star of Providence. \nAt the end of Dunkey's E3 2024 video, he cuts to a new trailer for Star of Prodivence showcasing the pixel-art shoot-em-up with a retro soundtrack to match, and it looks awesome. The game was revealed last year, but this publishing announcement footage reveals it's coming to Switch and PC (via Steam) in February. \nCheck out the Star of Providence reveal in the video below: \n\n\n\"Descent into the facility and seek out power eternal in this tough as hell, shoot em up masterpiece,\" Bigmode's website, which also describes the game as a bullet hell roguelike action game, reads. \"Engage in pulse-pounding battles with over 120 enemies in an ever-shifting gauntlet loaded with oncoming bullets and game-changing powerups. Only the most hardcore will survive.\" \nStar of Providence features more than 120 unique enemies, a vast array of weapons, upgrades, and modifiers, six playable ships (each with a different gameplay style), randomized level layouts, chaotic boss fights, and \"fish,\" whatever that means, according to the Bigmode website. \nHere are some additional Star of Providence screenshots: \n\nStar of Providence hits Switch and PC sometime in February of 2025. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Animal Well review. \nAre you excited for Star of Providence?

Sure, those are there, but perhaps the biggest selling point is the inclusion of Shadow the Hedgehog as a playable character. \nBut Shadow is much more than a reskin of Sonic.

From Dragon Age: Origins' real-time strategy RPG approach to Dragon Age II's mostly-set-within-one-city action experience to Dragon Age: Inquisition's strategy-action mix, BioWare hasn't quite defined the franchise's combat. However, a through-line is apparent from Origins to Inquisition: BioWare seemingly wants this franchise to be action but has attempted to shift to that without abandoning its longtime fans. \nWith Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has completed its transition from strategy to real-time action, but thanks to an optional tactical pause-and-play combat wheel that harkens back to the series' origins, I feel it's found a great (battle)ground …",

While the initial offerings lacked depth and sometimes left us craving more than the base game was able to deliver, Nintendo has stuck with the title and has improved the offerings through free updates. A few months after launch, the title added golf at no additional charge, and during today's Nintendo Direct, we learned that another free update is coming to the game this summer to add basketball to the mix.\nNintendo Switch Sports' implementation of basketball uses motion controls to dribble, pass, and shoot. You can participate in two-on-two matches locally, or compete in Five-Streak Battle matches and Three-Point Contests. You can also take part in a solo Three-Point Challenge, where you need to make as many baskets as you can before time expires.\nNintendo Switch Sports' basketball free update arrives this summer.

With many of the most classic titles already on Nintendo Switch Online's various catalogs, the output has decreased significantly. However, during today's Nintendo Direct, four of the most requested games were announced for release today.\nMetroid: Zero Mission, the excellent Game Boy Advance remake of the original Metroid, and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords, the Game Boy Advance remake of the classic SNES title but with a separate co-op campaign, come to Nintendo Switch Online's Game Boy Advance catalog. On top of that, Nintendo announced the Nintendo 64 catalog is getting two M-rated entries: Perfect Dark, the GoldenEye 007 spiritual successor from developer Rare, and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter.\nAs a reminder, the NES, SNES, and Game Boy libraries are included in the base Nintendo Switch Online subscription, while Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance, and Sega Genesis catalogs require you to upgrade to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription. As such, to access all of the games announced and released today, you'll need to subscribe to that premium membership.

That the letters appear to rely on evidence supplied by Spanish ISPs, indicating which of their customers accessed specific 'pirate' servers, is of even greater concern.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.\nThis is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.\nIf you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.\nNow, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)\n>",
