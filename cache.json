The studio’s heritage even goes back, via co-founder David Ventura, to the Nintendo DS classic Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan! (progenitor of Elite Beat Agents in the West).

Sure, we had Layton's Mystery Journey: Katrielle and the Millionaire's Conspiracy ported over to Switch in 2019, but that was always going to be more of a spinoff from the main story with no Hershel, no Luke, and (arguably) no intrigue on the puzzles.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Dodgy reseller listings aside, the Steam Deck has spent its entire life thus far without even a temporary price drop. That ends today, as the Steam Spring Sale has launched with the first official Steam Deck savings - a 10% cut across the range - alongside the more expected dealsplosion of discounted games.\nWhat’s more, this sale could also be the last time that the Steam Deck joins in a Steam sale, at least for a very long time. Lawrence Yang, a Valve designer who recently spoke to us about the Deck’s first year in the wild, has also told me that the company are \"looking at this as a one-time deal in celebration of Steam Deck's anniversary.\" You’ll therefore have until March 23rd, when the Spring Sale ends, to seize a saving on the handheld PC before it returns to base pricing – maybe for good.\nAll three Steam Deck versions are part of the sale, shedding exactly 10% apiece. The 64GB model is down from £349 / $399 to £314.10 / $359.10, the 256GB model drops from £459 / $529 to £413.10 / $476.10, and the top 512GB model falls from £569 / $649 to £512.10 / $584.10. Unlike the sad old days of 2022, there’s no lengthy waiting period once you put your order in, though I wouldn’t be surprised if it takes the full two weeks of Valve’s one-to-two week delivery estimate, what with the likely surge in demand.\n Read more",

Cut to a couple of weeks after release and I’m having an absolute whale of a time in Endnight Games’ survival horror - and it’s all thanks to sweet, succulent blueberries.\nIt all started when I learned that Sons Of The Forest has a peaceful mode, which completely removes all the gross, yucky cannibals, leaving you to grapple with survival in relative peace and quiet. The first time I met up with Kelvin and we got to work, casually making our shitty shelter and stick storage, I perused the guidebook to see what’s next, and I spotted a planter. A planter? Okay, so I assume you can plant seeds and grow food, then? That’s really co-WAIT, wait, wait. You're telling me this is basically a farming sim?\nRead more",

          "description": "The latest Steam Deck client update has added Valve’s local network game transfers feature – previously only available in beta form – to the Stable branch, marking a full launch for one of the most useful Steam Deck feature upgrades in months.\r\n\n\r\nIf you missed the local transfers beta release last month, know that the name is quite literal: it lets you transfer Steam game installs between your PC and your Steam Deck over a local network, rather than having to re-download them onto every device you own. It also works when transferring between a Steam Deck and another Steam Deck, or between two PCs. Valve have a little explainer here, but it’s simple enough that – for example – hitting the Install button for a game on your Steam Deck will automatically detect if your PC is on the same network, and start transferring as much as it can from the desktop instead of downloading the whole thing from scratch.\r\n\n\r\nYou can even opt into sending/receiving game data from PCs and Steam Decks owned by other people, so long as they’re also connected to the same local network. The biggest benefit seemingly comes to those with monthly data caps (morning, Yanks), as these transfers won’t usually involve any extra downloads. Even so, it’s a helpful addition for anyone on all-you-can-eat data as well, since local transfers are much faster than old fashioned installs. \r\n \nRead more",

Its twists and turns from the get-go have my brain doing mental gymnastics, not just in the game but in trying to figure out how to write around them for this review. I’m not going to spoil everything, but keeping your expectations completley wide open lets Paranormasight snake right on in and surprise you when you least expect it to. \nHere’s a quick elevator pitch: Paranormasight is a Squeenix-developed horror mystery visual novel about deadly rituals, ghost stories, curses, and the occult. Its subversive approach to classic visual novel staples make its puzzles feel smart and its horror scares hit hard. If you’re a fan of the thrills found in the Danganronpa and Zero Escape games, Paranormasight is like a bite-sized version of those two behemoths. It’s short, smart, and will keep you on your toes until the end.\nSo yeah, if that sounds like your thing, then have at it. From here on in, I'm going to be gabbing abut it in-depth.\nRead more",

          "description": "To track the public understanding of modern-day indie gaming is to look at the small-scale independent development scene through an Anglo-centric lens. While it would be unfair to ignore the hobbyists programming experiences in BASIC on their ZX Spectrum or similar, it’s commonly accepted that indie gaming as we recognise it today has its roots in the early days of the internet and the Y2K boom, when Flash, Gamemaker Studio and similar tools allowed things like Cave Story and N to grow. With online distribution further helping games like Bastion, Journey and World Of Goo to flourish, the definition of the indie game became: a title with big ambitions and creativity grown from small budgets and teams.\r\n\n\r\nIt's not entirely wrong, but it has obscured decades of hobby development that was once at the forefront - not just the stories of BBC Micro solo-development stars, but similar ones of hobby development from around the world. In Japan, the doujin markets of Comiket and beyond serve as a home for hobbyists to make, sell and share their creations. It is the doujin gaming scene that helped major studios like Fate/ studio Type-Moon, and franchises like 07th Expansion and Touhou Project, flourish in a way that would never be possible otherwise.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Last week, I was given a preview build of the upcoming first-person zombie-smasher and played about the first five hours of it in single-player, taking in sights like a community of gated millionaire mansions, a slightly less palacious but still ridiculous neighbourhood, and an upmarket hotel styled after the famous Beverly Hills Hotel. They're all full of weird stuff.\nThere's a panic room where a guy turned into a zombie mid-demo tape recording. Actress Emma, who you're battening down the hatches with, has a truly awful full-length Burt Reynoldsian portrait of herself. A shared house called the GOAT PEN, where a team of influencers all live together, has a set for a video series called LIT OR SH!T, and a whiteboard with the script for an apology video. I ask the game director David Stenton if it's low hanging fruit, or if there's no such thing with Hollywood rich people. \"Of course, it's low hanging fruit!\" he says, laughing. \"And also, there's no such thing.\"\nRead more",

          "description": "Until recently, the story of Intel’s Arc GPUs has been a litany of mild disappointments. After years of it being easier to buy an original O’Keefe than a reasonably priced graphics card, the Arc series brought hope that it might actually be possible to get a decent PC upgrade for less than £500. Then they were repeatedly delayed, confirmed to possess some unwelcome technical quirks (like wanting Resizable BAR on at all times), and ultimately released with merely decent-ish performance. Nothing awful, but nowhere near as special as they once seemed like they could be.\nIn 2023, however, Intel Arc may be on a redemption... arc. A series of driver updates, Intel claims, have improved average FPS performance by up to 87% since launch, with major gains in frame times (the time between each new rendered frame) as well. The specific model we have here, the Arc A750 Limited Edition, has also had its price cut from £330 / $289 to  £250 / $250. More power for less money? I’d say that’s worth a fresh evaluation.\nRead more",

I have no idea how old they are supposed to be and for some reason that’s not surprising.) survivors and a stalwart detective revisit the ruins of a hospital that was once home to a haunting ceremony. They all have amnesia, of course, because that’s a low-effort way to generate an air of mystery. Well, except the detective, who is just confused because he never really figured out what was going on in the first place. \nOverall, it’s a thoroughly okay game from 2008 that’s been papered over with some hazy lofi graphics to justify selling it at full price in 2023. It’s up to you if you think that’s worth it – I bought the Mass Effect remaster, so I’m hardly one to judge – but while the graphics have been thoroughly airbrushed, that’s no cure for Fatal Frame’s dated gameplay and undead pacing. \nRead more",

Bedtime Studios’ follow-up Figment 2: Creed Valley keeps very close to the beat of the first one. You don’t need to have played Figment 1 to enjoy this sequel, but I almost feel like you’d be missing you if you didn’t (especially as it’s free on Steam right now, for today only).\nFigment 2 has all the visual flair and catchy sing-songs of the first, but it feels weirdly smaller. Both games will run you about 5 hours each, but Figment 2 is a little less punchy, a little less diverse, and feels more like an encore rather than a dazzling comeback album. That’s not necessarily bad; I love an encore, and I enjoyed seeing more of Figment's surreal, subconscious mind-world. But, yeah, it’s very much the same as the first game, but with less scope and fewer fart clouds.\nRead more",

Besides the fact that it’s cheaper than buying an equivalent, prebuilt gaming rig, the DIY PC approach gives you more control over its components, teaches you skills you can later apply when upgrading or troubleshooting, and perhaps most importantly, isn’t anywhere near as difficult as it looks. Especially if you have a convenient, step-by-step guide to building a PC to hand. Incidentally…\nRead more",

And that's coming from someone who recently reviewed Team Ninja's Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, a game that's mighty good at grinding people into paste. I'm not trying brag; I'm being vulnerable with you. I have a case of the Ben Affleck blues, where most sessions of Clash's third-person action-adventuring have me veering from elation to being slumped against a wall with Affleck's signature grimace on my face.\nAside from being really difficult, I'm a bit undecided on how I feel about Clash in the portions I've played so far. It looks fantastic and puts some brilliant spins on combat, but levelling is a bore and exploration has a confusing edge. It's at once both a grand time and an annoying one. The surreal lands of Zenozoik, it turns out, aren't all sunshine and turkey men. There are a lot of turkey men, though.\nRead more",

What's going on here?\"\nThus, in a spirit of pure scientific enquiry, I booted up Sons Of The Forest and immediately discovered that everyone has been lying to me, because Sons Of The Forest is not a survival game. Sons Of The Forest is very clearly an early 00s b-movie action thriller. The script was left in a filing cabinet in Slough in an empty office until the office was repurposed into a call centre, at which point it was found by a middle-manager whose paintball team thought it was awesome, and somehow he sent it to a game developer by mistake.

In the case of the game, that's because The Light Brigade is VR roguelike, one that blends Souls-like dark fantasy with World War II-era weaponry, with you playing a spiritually immortal but physically fragile warrior responsible for saving the world.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Valve’s handheld SteamOS games machine has successfully evaded hardware flop status, currently sitting fourth in Steam’s own top sellers list a full year after it began shipping. That’s well deserved, too: the Steam Deck was a fun little alternative way to play PC games when it released, and through a combination of added features, ongoing improvements to game compatibility, and simply a wider choice of great games, it’s a better device now than it’s ever been.\r\n\n\r\nI was originally going to look back on the Steam Deck’s first 12 months with my eyes only, but what fun is a party of one? Thus I invited Valve designer Lawrence Yang and engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais for their takes on the Deck’s past, present, and future.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The new studio remains busy with its first project, an epic fantasy RPG sporting an original IP. A year ago today, the studio announced that it was partnering with Private Division, which is expected to publish the untitled game once its ready to roll.\n\"The market for independently produced games is growing rapidly and the technology is keeping pace,” said Laidlaw at the time of the studio's founding. “Small, diverse teams can now create high-quality experiences. For veterans of big-studio productions like myself and much of our team, this is the perfect time to get back to a small, agile, and highly motivated group. We want our games here at Yellow Brick to take potentially millions of players on wonderous journeys, and we want every member of our team to have a direct impact on the new worlds we’re creating.”\nThe post Fledgling developer Yellow Brick Games opens second studio in Montreal appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It's all in the family\nSumo Digital's asymmetrical multiplayer take on The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is locking in dates for both a technical test and full release. The gory multiplayer will test the waters on May 25, with a full release scheduled for August 18, 2023.\nBased on the 1974 horror film, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre looks to pit hapless travelers against the Slaughter family that loves to prey on them. It seems to be following in the same asymmetrical steps of many other multiplayer horror games these days. The victims run and hide, using stealth and wits to survive as the Slaughter Family players hunt them down. And you really don't want to get caught, as you can see in today's release date trailer, via IGN:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mlab3PEYzKE\nJust real gnarly stuff. This does not seem like a multiplayer game for the faint of heart.\nDeep in the heart of Texas\nIf that seems like your type of jam, though, there will be a technical test to kick the tires of this new horror game in May. Gun and Sumo Digital advise those who want to know more about the test to follow The Texas Chain Saw Massacre social channels, or you could keep an eye on the Steam page.\nThe Texas Chain Saw Massacre game interests me, though not solely because of my Texan roots. Many asymmetrical horror games have come and gone, and it feels like the extremely specific adaptations sometimes have trouble sticking around. Going up against established, multi-property juggernauts like Dead By Daylight has to be tough, so I'm curious to see what Sumo Digital brings to the table to make the Slaughter Family's horror experience stand out. You know, aside from the chainsaws.\nThe Texas Chain Saw Massacre hits on August 18 for PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One. It'll also be a Game Pass day one game, for both Xbox and PC.\nThe post Texas Chain Saw Massacre will hold technical test in May, ahead of August launch appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Triangles\nDry Cactus has announced that the next installment of the physics-filled bridge builder series, Poly Bridge 3, will be arriving on PC on May 30.\nThe Poly Bridge series represents a surprisingly large and extensive genre of physics games in which you design a bridge. Poly Bridge takes the concept in a more lighthearted direction. Instead of simply experimenting to figure out how a suspension bridge is supposed to function, you complete various tasks that often involve creating whacked-out draw bridges. The series differentiates itself by making things accessible and fun rather than simply challenging.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/bzZBURLA0iE[/embed]\nWith that said, I don’t know how we’ve wound up on a third title. The first Poly Bridge has over 100 campaign missions, and already my bridge-making imagination is stretched beyond its limit. I’m not saying that there is no room for more bridges, I’m just saying I can’t fathom it. Now, Dry Cactus is touting another “over 100” missions in Poly Bridge 3. Just how many gaps need to be bridged?\nThe trailer that has dropped alongside the announcement shows off some of its concepts, including a drawbridge that works via a front-end loader. Some of these various bridges appear to function entirely on magic, and the fact that there is some sort of tangible physics behind them makes me furious. I haven’t even attempted anything, and already, I’m feeling extremely inadequate.\nI guess I can find out if my bridge-building abilities carry any sort of way when Poly Bridge 3 comes to PC, MacOS, and Linux on May 30, 2023. If you’re new to the series, Dry Cactus is also providing a discount on the first two games on Steam.\nThe post Poly Bridge 3 bears the load on May 30 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The creation application will let users design and publish content directly into Fortnite starting March 22, 2023.\nThis creative tool has been talked about before by Epic CEO Tim Sweeney, as a way for people to build in-game content and release it in Fortnite. Thanks to the new store page for the Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN), we've got details on what exactly that entails.\nThe UEFN will allow users to import meshes, textures, animations, and audio. Animation, gameplay design, custom content, and more are all in store. Plus, it will have a Live Edit tool for real-time collaboration and revision control, as well.\nEpic plans to share more details next week, during its State of Unreal talk at GDC 2023.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teTroOAGZjM\nTap into the unreal\nA few FAQs on the Unreal Editor for Fortnite page clear up a bit about how this differs from other creation tools, as Fortnite already has Creative mode. UEFN is a PC-only editor with a range of tools. Rather than Creative, where you're controlling a character to build and edit islands, UEFN has more similarities with the tools and workflows used to develop Fortnite Battle Royale itself. It's planned to be built out and evolve through its Beta launch.\nThe result could be a fair bit of user-generated content, a la Roblox. Which, given how massive Roblox is, makes sense. I'm curious to see just what people can do with these tools, but also very curious about what plans look like for publishing and potentially monetizing this new wave of Fortnite content.

So get off the fence and commit.\nhttps://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1636351619188023299?s=20\nOn the weekend of March 31, players will be tasked with picking their monster of choice, before rallying forth into battle against their fellow Splatoon fans. For the purposes of this particular tourney, Shiver will be repping Nessie, Frye will be Team Aliens, while Big Man, as his name would denote, is all about Bigfoot. As per usual, a public vote will be held in Inkopolis, while match points will be tallied from Pro, Open, Tricolor, and Sneak Peek, with the ultimate winner revealed on Sunday, April 2.\nSo, who have you got? I know aliens exist because I've seen Marvin the Martian, and I know Bigfoot exists because he lived with The Hendersons. Additionally, I know that not just one Nessie, but an entire family of Nessies exist. I'm not sure who to roll with, so I guess I'll stick with my main girl Frye, and thus I'm fighting for the Xenomorphs, for E.T. for Xtro, and for the Killer Klowns from Outer Space.\nThe March 2023 Splatoon 3 splatfest kicks off on Friday, March 31 and will run until Sunday, April 2.\n*This is a reference for me and me alone, don't sweat it.\nThe post Splatoon 3’s next splatfest is all about monstrous legends appeared first on Destructoid.",

Stay with me here; it’s a grid-based isometric(check), roguelite (check), deck-building (check), strategy game (check), with settlement building (check). Also, it has pixel-art graphics (check).\n[embed]https://youtu.be/UwhnYyFfimo[/embed]\nI may sound dismissive, but I’m actually reporting this news because I think it looks pretty cool. There isn’t a lot of info here or in the trailer, but the toads; they dress real spiffy. Toads of the Bayou has you protecting your settlement from Baron Samedi, who I can never not associate directly with the henchman in Live and Let Die. You do this by building up your deck and strengthening your colony.\n“The goal for us was to allow the player to establish their place in this cursed environment, and make them appreciate how hard they fought and what they stood for. Nothing is ever granted in the Bayou, and thriving against the Baron's evil forces is a real achievement,” said Alexandre Clement, Game Designer at La Grange. That’s strangely motivational.\nWe’ve got a long wait ahead of us before we can step into the slimy wingtips of the titular toads, so I’m looking forward to seeing how Toads of the Bayou shapes up.\nToads of the Bayou is currently announced for PC and is coming out in 2024.\nThe post Toads of the Bayou brings the tactical swamp-folk in 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Tromatastic release is expected to ooze on PC and consoles in late-2023, and is already price-tagged at $24.99.\nStill one of the most baffling children's adaptations of all time, Toxic Crusaders is an animated spin-off of the extremely violent and thoroughly bad-taste Toxic Avenger movies — a series launched by Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz' notorious New York studio, Troma Productions. \"Toxie\" is a superhero born after bullied nerd Melvin Junko falls into a barrel of toxic waste, emerging as a physically deformed, eye-gouging, arm-ripping vigilante. The films are notable for their avalanche of sex and violence, featuring scripts that are packed with outrageously offensive characters and jokes.\nAnd thus, in 1991, TMNT producer Fred Wolf picked up the license for a children's TV show.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-tOCfDFxhw\nThe Toxic Crusaders video game will see one-to-four players select from a meaty 'n' mutated roster of seven characters — including Toxie, girlfriend Yvonne, humanoid dog Junkyard, and surfing scientist Headbanger — before heading into the streets of Tromaville to clean out its pollution-lovin' villains. Toxic Crusaders will feature classic arcade brawler action, a newly recorded score, full voice acting, motion-comic cutscenes, and cameos from other denizens of the Troma universe, including Poultrygeist and Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D.\nWhile I'm still kind of reeling from this bizarre news, I have to admit that if the aftermath of TMNT: Shredder's Revenge means we're to be inundated with beat-'em-up love letters to '90s shows, then I'm here for it.\nToxic Crusaders launches late-2023 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.\nThe post Troma’s Toxic Crusaders comin’ back in beat-’em-up form appeared first on Destructoid.",

There's also a demo out, though it's currently only available on the Nintendo eShop.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3NNRkR1fSw\nSea of Stars sees two protagonists, the Children of the Solstice. With one wielding sun powers and the other moon, they combine to create Eclipse Magic, the only thing capable of stopping The Fleshmancer. It looks quite nostalgic, helped by the fact that Chrono Trigger's Yasunori Mitsuda is a specil guest composer on the soundtrack.\nYou're a sea full of stars\nThis RPG is also the latest project from Sabotage, the studio behind 2018's The Messenger. In that one, the team tackled a different kind of old-school genre in the action-platformer. Here, with Sea of Stars, they take on the classic turn-based RPG.\nI played a little bit of the demo and found it intriguing, though I'm mostly holding off for the full game. I will say, I do really like the look that Sabotage has crafted for Sea of Stars so far. It's a colorful world with some great little details.

          "description": "Talented modders... assemble\nResident Evil 4 might only exist in demo form right now, but that hasn't stopped the indelible mod community from already bringing its own host of nightmarish characters to the infected villages of Europe. Case in point: This new mod from IvenXIII, which sees the worst animated character of all time, Shrek, battle to the death with special agent Leon S. Kennedy.\nThe mod, which is available for the PC version of the demo via hubworld Nexus Mods, sees the green menace replace the chainsaw-wielding Dr. Salvador, who comes barreling into Leon's world as a seemingly unstoppable member of a homicidal clan of villagers. Shrek carrying a chainsaw, complete with DEAD EYES, may be one of the most unnerving images in Resident Evil history, to be sure.\n\nShrek is not the only mod available for the Resident Evil 4 Chainsaw Demo, as other mod makers have already come up with replacement skins for Leon himself, including Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas star Carl \"C.J.\" Johnson, (by SERGIS2547), Uma Musume character Mihono Bourbon, (by ClownGodCG), and even a femme version of Leon themselves, (by wheezer123). Currently, there is no sign of a certain Tank Engine, but the grinning fool is practically guaranteed to make an appearance once the full game is released. It's pretty much tradition at this point.\nThere are other gameplay mods available on the site, including one which never triggers the church bell, offering infinite time to take on the entire village. All the mods available from NexusMods will require the installation of Fluffy'sModManager. Obviously, read up and make sure that you know what you're doing before you start prodding around in your registry folders and such.\nResident Evil 4, with or without Shrek, launches March 24 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms. The Chainsaw Demo is available to download now.\nThe post Shrek has already been modded into Resident Evil 4 because of course appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Good Boy\nA dazzling Japanese \"3D\" billboard for Square Enix hit Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade has been declared the winner of a contest held by the Tokyo Outdoor Advertising Association (TOAA).\nThe Final Fantasy VII 3D billboard, which could be seen in Tokyo back in the winter of 2021, stars beloved party member RED XIII, who is chased down by a Shinra helicopter high up over the rooftops of Midgar. Fortunately, it all ends happily, as our boy falls into a toy warehouse, for some goofy fake moustache chicanery. It's a genuinely fascinating and gorgeous piece of animation, and one can only imagine how much joy it brought to onlookers during the holiday period.\nYou can check out the full animation in the video below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6OFS3DCmmA&ab_channel=%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AF%E3%82%A6%E3%82%A7%E3%82%A2%E3%83%BB%E3%82%A8%E3%83%8B%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B9\nThe Tokyo Outdoor Advertising Contest, which is held every two years, recognizes advertising that it believes not only displays creativity and amazing visual design, but that also suitably fits in with the environment, offering a form of \"art and spectacle\" over the general crassness and tackiness of most advertising. Also brought into consideration are the advert's impact on the surrounding area, and whether or not it disrupts the aesthetic of the local area.\nWhile 3D billboards are nothing new, they are still incredibly sparse in their use in mainstream society, generally located to major metropolis' such as Tokyo, New York, and countries such as China and South Korea. They use depth perception and optical illusion to make characters appear to be leaping out from the buildings themselves and, when partenered with imaginative brands and beautiful animation, make for visually stunning talking points for passerbys.\nFinal Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade is available now on PS5 and PC.\nThe post Amazing Final Fantasy VII Red XIII 3D billboard wins advertising award appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Timely, with the remake around the corner\nI would watch pretty much anything Resident Evil 4 adjacent. That world was a whirlwind of action and silliness, and lends itself well to all sorts of mods, parodies, and projects. There's a reason people are still talking about it all these years later, and why it's basically Skyrim-tier in terms of its multiplatform port proliferation. That fan fervor likely led to this new delightful LEGO animation from creator Cara Aleatorio, who re-imagined the game's intro sequence.\nSimply titled \"Resident Evil 4 Animation,\" we're once again whisked away to the intro a lot of us have experienced 50 times or more since 2005: as Leon Kennedy arrives at the initial village in Spain. He quickly discovers the aggressive inhabitants, and the game never really stops from there on out. According to Cara Aleatorio, the project was made in Blender, with the Mecabrics add-on. It took \"around 3000 images\" to finish up the nearly four minute video, and \"1-2 months\" of work.\nIt's amazing how burned in my brain this intro is, and how big of a shock it was to see how things were changed (both subtly and not-so-subtly) in the remake. I can't wait to see all of the reactions from first-timers and long-time fans, but little things like the tower floor in the village square demo collapsing really got me.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPFDAp6fOcg\nThe post Resident Evil 4 LEGO fan video re-imagines the opening appeared first on Destructoid.",

There's one last piece of free DLC on the way. Citizen Sleeper gets its third free DLC episode on March 30, just one day ahead of its launch on PlayStation consoles.\nJump Over the Age's narrative RPG Citizen Sleeper was released last year, and has made its way to most other platforms alongside its DLC rollout. On March 31, both PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 owners will get a chance to check it out as well.\nFor those who already own Citizen Sleeper, March 30 will mark the third free DLC episode's launch date. Dubbed \"Episode 3: Purge,\" it's set to bring a conclusion to the refugee flotilla plot line introduced in this string of post-launch updates. These episodes are free updates for owners of the game, and will arrive packed in with the PlayStation versions.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIAEow9FCEY\nWake up Sleeper\nIf you haven't checked out Citizen Sleeper yet, or just need a good excuse for another run, this is a solid reason. I haven't dipped back in yet to see just how the new episodes are rolled into the full experience, but now that the plot line's concluded, I'm feeling a bit tempted.\nCitizen Sleeper is a narrative RPG that draws hefty inspiration from tabletop games. As a Sleeper, an artificial body with a copied consciousness on the run from corporate overlords, you have to survive day-by-day on Erlin's Eye, a station on the fringes of settled space. Though it starts as a race against the clock, it swiftly becomes a story about community, history, and how people support each other.\nIt's a really incredible game, one I felt confident in naming as one of my favorites of 2022. Whether you're a new Sleeper on the Eye or returning for another run, there will be some new stories waiting for you later this month.\nThe post Citizen Sleeper gets final free DLC episode and hits PlayStation this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

That also includes Metroid Prime Remastered, which just debuted its physical reward today.\nClocking in at 800 Platinum Points, the reward is a set of two pins, one of which is the game's logo, and the other: Samus, of course. These pins are on top of the downloadable Metroid Prime Remastered alternate box art cover. Here's the full description from Nintendo:\n\"A set of two rustless-iron lapel pins inspired by the Metroid Prime Remastered game are available to My Nintendo members. The game logo pin measures 3.5\" x 1.77\", and the Samus pin measures 3\" x 2.9\". Pin them to your hat, jacket, or other gear to show your fandom!\"\n\nYou love to see more Metroid merch out in the wild, even something as small as pins. It's hard to find basically anything featuring this series, and it's always great to see Nintendo remember that it exists. But with Metroid Dread making them a ton of cash, they're well aware of that now!\nAs a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time.

          "description": "Remember amiibo?\nAh, the Amiibo News Twitter account. It's been a great source of, well, amiibo news (!) since the account was created, and one of the few places carrying on the legacy of amiibo chasing. While Wave 4 was basically it for a lot of the community, Nintendo has persevered in pushing more plastic, and people are still buying them (albeit with less of a hassle). The newest bit of info they have for us is a potential Zelda amiibo restock, as evidenced by a relisting for the elusive Majora's Mask figure.\nThe eagle-eyed account spotted a Majora's Mask amiibo relisting on Best Buy, which typically coincides with a restock of that same line. Restocks recently came in for the Mario amiibo line, just in time for Mar10 Day. Given the excitement behind Tears of the Kingdom and the amiibo accompanying it, we could see a repeat of that same situation.\nWhat other Legend of Zelda amiibo could see restocks in 2023?\nWell, look no further than this official tweet from Nintendo! In addition to the aforementioned Majora's Mask amiibo, we also have potential restocks on the way for:\nLink (Rider - Breath of the Wild)\nZelda & Loftwing (Skyward Sword)\nAll three of those figures have directly confirmed functionality with Tears of the Kingdom, and will provide extra paraglider skins. More features could be revealed as we get closer to launch, but for now, those seem like a safe bet. Also, I'm sure a lot of collectors will be happy to see more Zelda anything out and about, as a few of these figures were hard to get.\nThe post Zelda amiibo restocks could coincide with the upcoming Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom launch appeared first on Destructoid.",

The new studio represents major growth for the Hitman developer, and is expected to play a key role in all of IO's forthcoming releases.\nWe are excited to announce the opening of our fourth IOI studio in Istanbul, Türkiye,\" reads the official press statement. \"Uniquely positioned in the pan-continental gateway to Europe and Asia, IOI Istanbul is a crucial part in the continued growth and success of IO Interactive.\"\nhttps://twitter.com/IOInteractive/status/1635930010350387201?s=20\n\"The mission of IOI Istanbul is to establish a hub for AAA game development in the region and create unique game experiences for our players across the world.

Speaking in a recent interview with Eurogamer, IO noted that its core franchise, Hitman, was on \"a little bit of a hiatus\" while the team concentrated on the James Bond title. They were also quick to point out that they saw Agent 47 as an integral part of the studio, so we can expect his return in good time.\nYou can check out more details on IOI Istanbul and its vacancies over on its new website.\nThe post IO Interactive establishes new studio in Istanbul, Turkey appeared first on Destructoid.",

While he would eventually be usurped by his lookalike son, Forrest, Marshall Law has continued to make his presence known throughout the series, and will step back into the ring for Tekken 8 — a little older, a little more weathered, but no less the highly skilled martial arts master. As spritely as he ever was, the new trailer sees Law laying down his namesake, tragic leather pants in tow.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6j1BEga_BIM&t=16s&ab_channel=BandaiNamcoEntertainmentAmerica\nMarshall Law's freeform martial arts skills — a variant of the Jeet Kune Do style developed by Bruce Lee — are bolstered with the use of a pair of nunchaku, allowing him to put a fresh hurting on his hapless opponent with his notoriously deceptive combo strings. Law's array of blistering strikes is in full effect, as well as his acrobatic flip kicks, but we're yet to see any sign of his iconic \"Run Up Your Opponent and Do a Moonsault\" grab — I'm sure it's in the mix. Law ends the battle with his super, which features a twin nunchaku combo followed up with an Enter the Dragon chest stomp. Rough day for Mr. Phoenix.\nTekken 8 is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X. It is tentatively expected to launch in 2023. Once you've watched Marshall Law do his thing, then be sure to check out the previous trailers for Jin Kazama, Kazuya Mishima, Nina Williams, and Paul Phoenix.\nThe post Marshall Law is the next veteran to make a grand return in Tekken 8 appeared first on Destructoid.",

In the press release announcing the news, the company only lists Berzerk and Frenzy. Atari simply says it has acquired a \"dozen retro arcade games\" so it's likely the other 10 properties are from the same era of arcade games as Berzerk and Frenzy. \n\"Atari...announced today the acquisition of a dozen retro arcade games, including the '80s classics Berzerk and Frenzy,\" the press release reads. \"Atari will seek to expand digital and physical distribution of the classic titles, create new games based on the IPs, and explore brand and merchandising collaborations.\"\nAtari says Berzerk is \"a top-down, multidirectional shooter designed by Alan McNeil that was released for arcades in 1980.\" It's perhaps best known for being the first arcade video game with speech synthesis. Following its arcade release, Berzerk was ported to the Atari 2600 and Atari 5200 by the console maker. Frenzy is actually a sequel to Berzerk first released in 1982. \n\"Berzerk is one of those foundational games that so many people first encountered playing on an Atari console,\" Atari CEO Wade Rosen writes in the press release. \"Berzerk, and the other titles included in this acquisition, are a perfect fit for our strategy of commercializing classic retro IP.\"\nWho knows if we'll learn what the other 10 retro arcade properties Atari has acquired are – only time will tell.

At one point, he flexes his bicep so hard that it makes the sleeve of his leather jacket explode off of his arm. He also rides his motorcycle into battle, which is pretty cool and reemphasizes that he is, in fact, a biker. Paul joins previously announced fighters such as Kazuya, Jin, Nina, and others. \n\n\nTekken 8 doesn’t have a release date, but there’s a solid chance it’s arriving later this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

The game was first announced in 2019, and developer Red Barrels gave players their first hands-on sample of the game via a closed beta last October. The ETA for the full release remains shrouded in mystery, however. \n\n\nThe Outlast Trials mixes up the formula of the previous entries by letting you play alongside friends in four-player co-op (although you can still play solo). The game unfolds in a secret facility during the Cold War, with players controlling involuntary test subjects being tortured in gruesome experiments. Avoiding enemies instead of confronting them remains the key the survival, though you obtain and upgrade tools that can increase your odds at staying hidden or slowing foes down. \nYou can check out The Outlast Trials in early access on Steam and The Epic Store.",

Actor Peter Weller, who portrayed Murphy in the original films, is scheduled to reprise his role in the game.\nYou can see the action unfold for yourself below.\n\n\nDeveloper Teyon was founded in 2006 and has released nearly 100 games since.

Capcom has heard those complaints and plans on changing the rain to make it more palatable. \nIn an interview with Press Start Australia (thanks IGN), the outlet asked RE4 producer Hirabayashi Yoshiaki if the team was aware of the negative response to the rain, and he had this to say: \n“We’ve seen everyone’s reaction to the rain effects, and we are working on a day-one patch to make adjustments”\nSo there it is. It looks like “raingate” will soon be a thing of the past, and it’s nice that Capcom recognized the complaints ahead of Resident Evil 4’s release.  \nResident Evil 4 launches on March 24 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC.

The main story unfolds across three interconnected campaigns set on land, the sea, and the sky and features a new cast of commanders. It also features a new roguelike campaign called Conquest that tasks players to complete a series of smaller battles while making permanent choices and relying on the same pool of units, health, and resources. \n\n\nWargroove 2 features four-player co-op and versus battles (local and online) along with rule customization and asynchronous play. An in-game editor allows players to create custom maps, campaigns, and even cutscenes to share with other players. \nThe first Wargroove was lauded as a fun throwback to Advance Wars when it launched in 2019, so we’re excited to see what Chucklefish has in store for the follow-up.

It will cost $29.99 on digital storefronts, and preorders include the Lost Silverwing in-game bonus. You can also purchase the Digital Deluxe Edition for $39.99, and it includes additional digital items like a Silverwing Supply Station Pack, Home Sweet Home cave decorations, exclusive spells, and Unchained skins. \nCheck out the game in action in the new trailer below: \n\n\n\"Developed by Digital Sun, creators of Moonlighter, the Mageseeker is a gritty 2D hi-bit pixel action RPG, set in Demacia, a mighty kingdom in the world of Runeterra that seeks to curtail what it deems as forbidden magic while wielding magic themselves to maintain order,\" a press release reads. \"Play as Sylas, an escaped mage who joins a band of rebels in the deep forest. Their revolution will shatter Damcai's deceptive peace – a peace built with the blood and sweat of mages. The Mageseeker provides an action-packed fantasy gameplay experience for those looking to experience a story of power, identity, and justice.\" \nRiot Games also revealed today that it is selling a physical Collector's Edition of the game for $169.99. It includes a Sylas statue, an art book, a deluxe art print, the Lux Comic (special edition hardcover), Sylas & Lux enamel pins, and a vinyl soundtrack. All of this comes housed within an exclusive custom box. \n\nThe Mageseeker follows the release of 2021's League of Legends Story game, Ruined King. Check out our thoughts on that in the Game Informer's Ruined King: A League of Legends Story review. The other two games Riot Games plans to release this year are Song of Nunu and Convergence. \nAre you checking out The Mageseeker next month? Let us know in the comments below!",

The game, which challenges you to blast the demons of Hell to the beat of an original soundtrack featuring some of the biggest names in metal, is adding two new original songs to the soundtrack through the first piece of downloadable content.\nThe DLC, Dream of the Beast, adds original songs from two singers who didn't appear on the main game's soundtrack. Cristina Scabbia from Lacuna Coil and Will Ramos from Lorna Shore join the cast of recognizable singers to contribute to the soundtrack. Dream of the Beast also adds The Red Right Hand, a new machine gun, and three new outfits, each of which provide unique gameplay modifiers.\nThese updates join the game as part of the Dream of the Beast DLC, but players who don't purchase the premium content also have something to be excited for. The same day the DLC arrives, players can expect a free title update for Metal Hellsinger. This free update adds a new song selection feature.\nBoth of these updates arrive on March 29 on all platforms. The game, which took home Game Informer's \"Best Shooter\" award for 2022, is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

For each model type, there's a (Warrior of) Light version and a Dark version, which basically equates to white and blue-green, and black and purple-pink. All four of the shoes look great but before you get too attached, these shoes are Japan-only for now. There's no word on if they'll come to the U.S. \nCheck out the shoes in the gallery below: \n\nEach of these shoes will cost 17,050 yen, which is roughly $125, according to Techraptor. They will be released in Japan next week on March 15. \nShoes inspired by video games have risen in popularity, with Converse releasing two sets of Pokémon-inspired shoes last year. Perhaps more than any other shoe maker, though, Puma has been steadily releasing video game shoes. In 2018, it released a pair of sneakers based on Sonic the Hedgehog's iconic red shoes and then in 2020, Puma released a line of Super Mario All-Stars shoes. Puma announced some NBA 2K21 shoes in 2021 and then just two months later, the company revealed an Animal Crossing: New Horizons line of sneakers. \nWhile waiting to learn more, read Game Informer's Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker review. \n[Source: Techraptor]\nWhat do you think of these Final Fantasy XIV shoes?
