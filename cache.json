Indeed, an unannounced single-player Titanfall game was quietly shelved last year, and if there’s any burning sense of unfinished business among series devs Respawn Entertainment, it wasn’t evident during my recent visit to try out Apex Legends’ Season 20 update.\nEven so, it turns out some still carry the fire, at least as source of inspiration for Apex lore and mechanics.

          "description": "If there’s a secret to how Apex Legends has endured the past five years, an era marked by as many FPS failures as successes, then it might be this: there are no sacred cows in live service. Since its surprise launch in February 2019, developers Respawn Entertainment have chopped and changed everything from hitbox-shrinking Naruto run animations to entire character designs and ability kits, gutting and reworking gear and class mechanics along the way. The incoming Season 20 update, titled Breakout, represents the latest large-scale rejig, adding upgradeable skill tress for its playable Legends that promise MOBA-esque progression and the maddest fights yet.\nThen again, if you actually ask Respawn’s Apex team how they reached this point – as I did when I visited their Los Angeles offices for a Season 20 test run – you’re unlikely to get just one answer. Rather, the battle royale’s unusual longevity in a fiercely contested space is more often attributed to those ongoing work-and-rework efforts themselves, the scope of which sometimes remains a surprise to the developers themselves. As does, according to lead game designer Devan McGuire, Apex’s success.\nRead more",

I was thrilled to see the 5700X3D debut at £233 at Amazon - before stocks were exhausted and it went back up to £240, anyway. \nNow though, the faster 5800X3D has dropped to nearly the same price, just £234 - an even better deal given its higher clock speeds and (very marginally) faster performance. If you're still running an older Ryzen processor and your motherboard can be updated to support the 5800X3D, then I highly recommend this processor, especially if you're using a comparatively low-res 1080p or 1440p display as you're more likely to be CPU-limited at these resolutions!  \nRead more",

Nowadays it means pretty, lovable or charming, albeit perhaps with an undertone of mistrust or contempt, as in the phrase \"that's a cute observation, Edwin\". But the word originally evolved from \"acute\", which very broadly means sharp or intense. \"Acute\" was once a Middle English word for a short-lived fever - it's related to \"ague\", a word you've likely come across in a medieval fantasy RPG somewhere, which refers to fits of sweating and shivering. The word \"cute\", then, is secretly diseased, and so, perhaps, is the experience of cuteness. There's a psychological phenomenon called \"cute aggression\" which refers to the desire to physically envelop, dominate and even abuse the thing you find cute - \"I just want to squeeze you till you pop\".\n Read more",

I mean, why waste them when you're a young telekinetic hellbent on getting your revenge on the cult that raised you and held you hostage for your entire life? One bullet goes a long way when you can alter the path of its trajectory with each fresh kill you land - as long as they're visible in your immediate eyeline, that is. There are no swoopy swerves going on here, and the thrill of each level is working out the best (and quite literal) angle of attack to take down every last target. I've been playing the first handful of levels of Children Of The Sun over the last week or so, and no word of a lie, this murderous mix of Hitman, Holedown and Sniper Elite has shot straight into my gooey, beating heart.\nRead more",

          "description": "A great 3D platformer seems to be a rare and special thing these days. I think Psychonauts 2 was the last one that really took my breath away, but outside of that (as well as obviously every 3D Nintendo platformer), I often struggle to think of many games that could be considered its equal. There's always something holding them back, isn't there? Whether it's a wonky camera, slightly unwieldly controls, or the platforming itself is just a little too pedestrian to ignite the imagination.\nSo where does Penny's Big Breakaway fit into the equation? This is the next game from former Sonia Mania dev Christian Whitehead's new studio, Evening Star, and yep, you can definitely tell this was made by some real Sonic heads. Penny and her (strangely toothy) sentient yo-yo, err, Yo-Yo, feel like a ball of energy just waiting to bust out across the colourful scenery of their home world of Macaroon, and golly, they sure can fly with just a couple of timely button presses. Alas, there is a but. For me at least, Penny and Yo-Yo are perhaps a bit too energetic for my platforming tastes, and having spent a few hours with an early preview build, I often found them quite a rambunctious pairing to keep under control.\nRead more",

It has also crashed twice during cutscenes. It's a shame, because I've quite enjoyed the bits that I have played (which amount to about half of the campaign, in single player). As a cross section of the three of us who have the game, one hasn't been able to boot it at all, and it works apparently perfectly for the other - and we tested both the retail build and the review build.

For too long had PC folks had to 'make do' with the quite nasty mobile ports of these games, and the Pixel Remasters looked set to finally rectify that with proper versions replete with their original artwork. But one thing was missing. Well, several things were missing it turns out, but chief among them were, of course, its damn fonts - a point of contention that's plagued many a Square Enix PC port in recent years, and one that fans quickly set about trying to fix with mods. Extra salt was then added to the wound when Square Enix said that last year's Switch and PS4 versions of the Pixel Remaster series would have two different font options straight out of the box - and it's only now that the PC versions have finally caught up.   \nRead more",

          "description": "Inflexion Games have announced accessibility options for Nightingale, the Victorian \"gaslamp fantasy\" survival game in which you wander the Fae Realms in bowler hat and ballgown, building houses and murdering eldritch wildlife. Among the wildlife you'll murder are giant spiders, which might be a dealbreaker for some people, so it's just as well Nightingale comes with an arachnophobia mode which transforms those spiders into... large, winged balloons with teeth. It also replaces decorative, non-interactive, smaller spiders and scorpions found in the game's environments with ant models. If you have a phobia for ants or menacing balloons, you're out of luck, I guess. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I bought Baldur's Gate 3 shortly after its release as a need than a want, when I was a year-and-half into my gender transition and hormone replacement therapy. Gender transition is not just an arduous journey of self-discovery, but also a profound and constant engagement with one’s own reality. I was desperate for some escapism, and Larian Studios’ much-anticipated new entry into the Baldur’s Gate fantasy RPG franchise offered the perfect rabbit hole to fall down.\nAs a child, my gaming habits were relatively stereotypical for a closeted girl: select female characters wherever possible, especially in RPGs. But the immersion almost always wears off. The trans inclusion in games like Dungeon Siege, Sacred 2: Fallen Angel, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and others is effectively non-existent, and the result for transgender and transsexual players is a feeling that, even in fantasy worlds, we are invisible at best. Nocturne, a trans supporting character in Baldur's Gate III played by Abigail Thorn, has changed that experience for me. In an interview, Thorn shared some of her thoughts and experiences regarding Nocturne and trans representation in games.\n \nRead more",

Given how everything new and exciting ultimately becomes normal and mundane, this is perhaps an unfair expectation of technology that is now a decade old. Nonetheless, if you want me to sit with a shoebox pressed uncomfortably against my eyes for two hours like an ocular gom jabbar, then what's inside the shoebox better be pretty darned transformative.\nWhich is to say that LEGO Bricktales provided one of those moments. I was sat in my living room, with all its clutter visible through the Quest 3's coloured passthrough, and hovering above my table was a great big LEGO diorama of a jungle. All of it was rendered perfectly to scale, as if I could pick up the minifigs between my thumb and forefinger.

However, a beta event that is open to everyone kicks off in just a few days on February 8 and lasts through February 11. Anyone can jump in and play for free up to the rank of Infamy Brigand, which is Tier 6 Rank 1. Thankfully, all progression from the beta carries over to the full release, so anyone interested in checking it out has no reason not to!\n\n\n\n\nA Content-Filled Open Beta\n\n\nEven though progression in the open beta only goes up to the Infamy Brigand rank, there is a ton of content in the beta. All of the regions are accessible and explorable, as well as the ability to access the Helm of your ship. There are also dynamic events active in-game allowing players to battle against Ghost Ships, Sea Monsters, Merchant Convoys, and Elite Warships.\n\n\nAlso, cross-play and cross-progression are enabled for the open beta. This means players across all platforms—PC(Ubisoft Connect, Epic Games Store), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S can all play together. Furthermore, you can switch between the platforms you are playing on and your data will be saved and available on each.\n\n\nThose who participate in the beta also get access to some exclusive cosmetic rewards including a Basilisk I Culverin cannon, a Sail Emblem and Sail Pattern for your ship, a Cookie the Lemur pet, and a sign language emote.\n\n\nSkull and Bones has had quite a journey over the past few years. I was a huge fan of ship combat in Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag which is where Skull and Bones supposedly originally got its premise. It's evolved quite a bit since then, but even still I'm interested in seeing what it has to offer.\n\nThe post Skull and Bones open beta this week will save progress for full launch appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Few things are consistent in games. Studios often change and shift over the years, bringing in new ideas and retiring old concepts. But bless Vanillaware, their food has never stopped looking incredible, as the latest trailer for Unicorn Overlord shows.\n\n\nThe most recent entry in Atlus and Vanillaware's series of instructional videos, introducing various gameplay elements in Unicorn Overlord, covers unity and relationships within your party. It's a big army, and as we all know, love can—and will—bloom on the battlefield.\n\n\nImage via Atlus/Vanillaware\n\n\nAllies in Vanillaware's upcoming tactical RPG can build rapport with each other while fighting in the same unit. Eventually, this leads to both in-battle boons and off-hours conversations.\n\n\n\n\nBon Appetit\n\n\nWhile you could just fall in love through combat, food is also a fast way to someone's heart. And Unicorn Overlord certainly seems to have that in spa- oh my, Margherita pizza, my favorite! Vanillaware, how did you know?\n\n\nImage via Atlus/Vanillaware\n\n\nIn all seriousness, food has long been the secret weapon of Vanillaware's art department, and I'm glad to see their fantasy fare has not dipped in deliciousness. Eating meals, as well as gift-giving, is another way to up those bonds and forge new ones in Unicorn Overlord.\n\n\nBetween all this comradery and all the possible classes that could await, Unicorn Overlord is looking like something tactics sickos should keep an eye on. We're not far out from release, either. The latest from Vanillaware is due out on March 8 for PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.\n\nThe post Unicorn Overlord highlights unity and delicious food in latest trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Star Wars franchise has always been renowned for its iconic music. The series has earned plenty of big-time nominations and award wins over the last 45 years. Many of these came thanks to one of the best to ever do it in composer John Williams. Now, after last night's Grammy Awards, we add a few more names to that list. \n\n\nStephen Barton and Gordy Haab of Respawn Entertainment nabbed the hardware for Best Score Soundtrack for Video Games and Other Interactive Media, for their excellent work on the excellent Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. Their accomplishment earned the duo a shoutout from the official Star Wars X account. \n\n\n\n\nBarton and Haab beat out some pretty stiff competition for the 2024 Grammy. The duo bested composers who worked on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, God of War Ragnarök, Hogwarts Legacy, and Stray Gods: The Roleplaying Musical.\n\n\nThis is the second year the Grammys has issued an award in the category of Best Score Soundtrack for Video Games and Other Interactive Media. Last year, Stephanie Economou won the award for her work on Assassin's Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarök.\n\n\nPrior to 2023, video games could only earn nominations for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media. Only one video game had previously earned a Grammy nomination for its outstanding soundtrack: in 2013, Austin Wintory won for his work on Journey.\n\n\nIt isn't just the Grammy win that the Respawn team should be proud of. For their work on Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, the developer also accumulated numerous nominations across the Golden Joystick Awards, The Game Awards, and The Steam Awards. The game also has four nominations at the 27th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards, which will take place on February 15. \n\nThe post Star Wars Jedi: Survivor soundtrack brings home a Grammy appeared first on Destructoid.",

I'd go as far as saying that with the first NieR and Metal Gear Solid 3, Persona helped shape what I thought stories in games could be. \n\n\nIt's no longer 2013, and more stories have come along that further shaped my tastes. I've admittedly fallen out of love with Atlus due to being relatively disappointed by more recent releases. 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim might rank among my favorite games ever, but it only published that title with Vanillaware developing. While I regard some of Atlus' RPGs among my favorites, revisiting Persona 3 came with a worry I didn't feel with any other remake I've played. \n\n\nWhen seeing Persona 3 Reload's inclusions, it made me …",

          "description": "WWE superstar Brock Lesnar has been removed from the 2K mobile game WWE Supercard, the latest in a series of changes following a federal investigation into sex trafficking allegations against former WWE owner Vince McMahon. \n\n\nThough Lesnar is not mentioned by name in a sexual assault and trafficking lawsuit against former WWE owner Vince McMahon from Janel Grant, there are several references to an individual who is believed to be Lesnar. \n\n\nScreenshot via WWE 2K's YouTube channel\n\n\nWhy Brock Lesnar may have been removed from WWE Supercard\n\n\nThe lawsuit only names a \"former UFC Heavyweight Champion\" who was allegedly contacted by McMahon. Cageside Seats reports \"McMahon [allegedly] enticed [Lesnar] to sign a new contract in August 2021 by offering Grant as 'a sexual commodity' for his use.\"\n\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, the individual in question showed interest in a sexual encounter, but \"a snowstorm changed WWE Superstar's travel plans, and Ms. Grant ultimately used the weather and COVID-19 as an excuse to back out.\"\n\n\nBrock Lesnar is the only male UFC Heavyweight champion who was prominent on WWE programming during the events, leading many to speculate he was involved. \n\n\nThough Lesnar's involvement has not been confirmed in court, he's now been removed from WWE Supercard. It is also rumored that Lesnar was taken off the 2024 Royal Rumble card, with many reporting that former NXT champion Bron Breakker took his place. \n\n\nWith all these changes, fan's eyes are now on the roster of the upcoming WWE 2K24, as many wonder if he'll be featured in the game. WWE 2K24 is scheduled to be released on March 8 for those who buy the standard edition, with an early access period for those who purchase the Deluxe Edition or Forty Years of WrestleMania Edition. A full roster has yet to be announced, so fans will have to wait until closer to release to confirm if Lesnar is on the roster or not. \n\nThe post 2K removes Brock Lesnar from WWE mobile game after Vince McMahon lawsuit allegations appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you're planning to dive into the world of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, don't expect Cliff to be with you. According to creator and game director Hideo Kojima, Mads Mikkelsen (Hannibal) will not be returning for the 2025 sequel.\n\n\nFor those who need a quick reminder, Mads Mikkelsen played Captain Cliff Unger, the secondary antagonist, in the original Death Stranding, released in 2019. Throughout the game, Cliff would bring Sam into his war-themed Beach and attack him with BTs. Mads' performance as the militant entity brought him critical acclaim, leading to several awards, including Best Performance at The Game Awards that year.\n\n\n\n\nWhy isn't Mads Mikkelsen in Death Stranding 2: On The Beach?\n\n\nDespite the overwhelming praise for Mads' role in Death Stranding, Kojima explained both he and Mads believe that Cliff's story was told the best way possible and want to close that chapter on the character. \n\n\nWhile I was a fan of Cliff in the original, I wholeheartedly agree that the character shouldn't come back. It feels wrong when any form of entertainment brings well-off characters back for nostalgia or shock value. I'm looking at you, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League with your Arkham Batman. \n\n\nRegardless, Death Stranding 2: On The Beach looks like a wild ride. Its latest trailer at the recent State of Play was...interesting. Troy Baker's Higgs is alive and looking like Gene Simmons and The Joker had a baby, and we now have a sentient puppet moving at 10 fps. Oh, and Mad Max director George Miller is here. I'm sure it'll all make sense when the game releases in 2025, but it's still crazy to think it could get weirder. \n\n\nFor fans of Cliff, don't lose hope just yet. We may see the character done in live-action from the A24 adaptation of Kojima's 'Strand' genre game. I wouldn't put it past Kojima to cast everyone, even Mads, as their characters again. All we can do is wait and see. \n\nThe post Mads Mikkelsen not returning for Death Stranding 2: On the Beach appeared first on Destructoid.",

Today, Rya Ga Gotoku Studio has confirmed just that. \n\n\nThe Sega-owned developers revealed that Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth has already crossed over the 1,000,000 copies shipped threshold. It took the game a mere week to do so. \n\n\n\n\nWhen you look at review scores across the industry for Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, it's easy to see why the latest core entry to the series is doing so hot. Destructoid gave the game a great review. On Metacritic the title earned a 92, 89, and 89 across the Xbox Series X, PlayStation 5, and PC respectively. \n\n\nThe series did a bit of a soft reboot with 2020's Yakuza: Like a Dragon into RPG territory. As stated in our Infinite Wealth review, it has been a bit of a transition period for the franchise as the developers settle in on their vision, but RGG seems to have nailed it. It's clear from these sales that the series' fanbase is excited about where it's headed.\n\n\nTo commemorate Infinite Wealth's achievement, Rya Ga Gotoku Studio is releasing free in-game swag as a reward to players for helping in the title's success. The development team will be gifting a celebratory T-shirt set with timing and further details coming at a later date. \n\n\nIf you're still working your way through Infinite Wealth with its seemingly infinite things to do, check out Destructoid's Infinite Wealth hub.

In the background audio of the clip, you can hear Jim Carrey's distinct laughter as the iconic Sonic villain.\n\n\n\n\nYou don't have to merely go on Carrey's Doctor Eggman laugh as proof of his return. Variety also confirmed the news this morning. \n\n\nCarrey, one of the most prolific comedic actors of all time, revealed in 2022 that he would be retiring from acting. Speaking to Access Hollywood, Carrey stated \"I’m retiring. Yeah, probably. I’m being fairly serious.\" \n\n\nHe went on to note that he likes \"my quiet life.\" Carrey said, \"If the angels bring some sort of script that’s written in gold ink that says to me that it’s going to be really important for people to see, I might continue down the road, but I’m taking a break.”\n\n\nCarrey's quote came out shortly before Sonic the Hedgehog 2 went on to be wildly successful at the box office. So while the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 script likely isn't \"written in gold ink,\" Carrey's paycheck to return as Dr. Robotnik just may be. \n\n\nYou won't have to wait until December to get your Sonic movie universe fix, though. Knuckles, a six-episode live-action series is planned for early 2024 on Paramount Plus. The series will feature Idris Elba returning to voice the warrior Echidna.

          "description": "If you have plans for Valentine's Day, they better be with a fire-breathing boar. That's who you'll be tangoing with in two weeks, because Castlevania-inspired action game Lords of Exile finally has a launch date set for February 14, 2024.\n\n\nIt's been a while since we took a look at Lords of Exile, which initially smashed its relatively modest Kickstarter goal to the tune of 258% funding back in June 2020. Naturally, it grew into a more ambitious project in the months that followed, moving it well past the launch window they originally had in mind. As a result, it all looks pretty different from the earlier crowdfunding trailer, particularly when it shows the powers you can summon to aid you.\n\n\nLook, I'm just saying, if any video game had the elevator pitch of \"Castlevania with JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Stands,\" I'd be in before the exclamation point dropped. \n\n\n\n\nAlso, is this the same boar from before? Talk about a glow-up!\n\n\nScreenshot via Squidbit Works\n\n\nBeyond any Stand-like shenanigans—referred to as Shadows in the game's menu—Lords of Exile appears to pride itself on its simplicity. It even goes so far as to include \"linear level design\" as a selling point, really driving home what makes classic side-scrollers so easy to go back to time and time again. The pacing is also in line with the classic 'Vanias, as our stalwart hero plods along at a snail's pace in between leaps and slashes. \n\n\nWhen done right, these throwback adventures can be just as memorable as the inspirations behind them. Look at the Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon games, for instance, or (hopefully) the upcoming The Transylvania Adventure of Simon Quest. Where Lords of Exile slides into the lineup remains to be seen, so we'll keep an eye on it as it heads to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC. In the meantime, you can try out a demo on Steam right now.  \n\nThe post Lords of Exile finally dated, looks like Castlevania with JoJo’s Stands appeared first on Destructoid.",

In addition to touting an AI learning opponent feature for Master Duel and VR experience with Duel Links, a collection of classic Yu-Gi-Oh titles served as the big new game announcement.\nDubbed Yu-Gi-Oh! Early Days Collection, this compilation consists of the very first Yu-Gi-Oh games ever released, including titles only available in Japan.

Konami plans to announce the other titles in the collection in the future, so you can start building your wishlist now.

          "description": "Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is one of the biggest Xbox exclusives on the horizon. According to a new report, however, Microsoft might be thinking of bringing Indy to other platforms.\nThe Verge has spoken to an insider familiar with Microsoft’s plans who claims the publisher is considering the idea of bringing several first-party titles to other consoles, like releasing Indiana Jones on the PlayStation 5. The source claims that Bethesda is tentatively targeting a December release for the title and that it will launch as an Xbox/PC title before possibly coming to PlayStation 5 after a short exclusivity window. \n\n\nRemember that nothing has been officially announced or confirmed, so take this report with a grain of salt. It’s worth noting, though, that during Microsoft’s trial with the FTC over its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Bethesda’s then head of publishing, Pete Hines, testified that parent company ZeniMax had initially signed an agreement with Disney to make Indiana Jones a multiplatform game. Microsoft later amended this deal to make the game an Xbox exclusive after it acquired ZeniMax in 2020, with Hines explaining the decision was made in the name of \"reducing risk and trying to get a degree of clarity.\"\nMicrosoft’s rumored multi-platform approach has garnered plenty of speculation in recent months. The publisher is reportedly looking to bring first-party games like Hi-Fi Rush and Sea of Thieves to rival platforms in the near future. Starfield is also rumored for a PS5 launch, as reported by XboxEra. \nIndiana Jones and the Great Circle was first announced in 2021 and had its full reveal during the Xbox Developer Direct last month. The first-person action-adventure romp stars Troy Baker as Indy in a story set between Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade. The game is slated to launch sometime this year for Xbox Series X/S and PC. \n[Source: The Verge]",

Majora's Mask's unique structure and bizarre tone have earned it legions of passionate defenders and detractors, and one long-time Zelda fan is going to experience it for the first time to see where he lands on that spectrum.\nJoin Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard today and each Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. CT as they gradually work their way through the entire game until Termina is saved.

But it’s not because the game is terrible. It’s because even after five hours, I still have no idea how I feel about it.\nThere is a scene in The Dark Knight Rises that I always assumed would become a meme, but never did. When Anne Hathaway’s Selina Kyle gets stopped trying to escape at the airport by Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s John Blake, he asks her about Bruce Wayne’s fate. In a fantastic one-line performance, she looks into his eyes with genuine uncertainty and fear and says simply, “I’m not sure.” And that’s exactly how I feel when someone asks me what I think of Rocksteady’s Suicide Squad.\n\nI am not a fan of the genre Suicid…",

If you're unfamiliar with what this festive celebration of games is, every year, Steam holds its Next Fest to highlight (mostly) indie games coming out this year and beyond with fun, often bite-sized demos. And the best part is the demos are completely free! \nGame Informer got access to some of these demos before their launch when Steam Next Fest begins on Monday, February 5, and enjoyed quite a few. That's why in today's installment of New Gameplay Today, hosts Wesely LeBlanc and Kyle Hilliard want to showcase three games: Pepper Grinder, a fun momentum-based platformer, Kamaeru: A Frog Refuge, a cozy frog farming sim, and Dystopika, a chill cyberpunk city builder. \nCheck out gameplay of all three of these demos in the NGT below: \n\n\nAll three of these games are set to launch sometime later this year, but if you're interested, you can try each out (and dozens more) as part of Steam Next Fest, which begins Monday, February 5, and ends Monday, February 12. \nHead over to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

Early looks made it seem like a pleasant environmental puzzle game about a pair of brothers going on an adventure, but actually playing the game showcased an impressive and specific point of view from its creator, Josef Fares. You can read Game Informer's review of the original Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons by following the link. The game was both heartwarming and heartbreaking, and to this day still features some of the best examples of gameplay as storytelling, and it's all done without any proper dialogue. After Brothers' release, Fares went on to found Hazelight, the studio behind A Way Out and It Takes Two.\nNow, 10 years later, developer Avantgarden Games is preparing to release a remake of the game on February 28 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Join Marcus Stewart and me as we take a look at the new version and reminisce about the original.\nAnd for more on Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, read our in-depth Afterwords on the game with Josef Fares from 2013 here.\n\n\nHead over to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

          "description": "Today's announcement of Sonic x Shadow Generations brought all kinds of love for Sonic's dark doppelganger as longtime fans celebrate Shadow's return after being absent from recent projects like Sonic Superstars and Sonic Frontiers. However, players won't need to wait for the fall launch of Sonic x Shadow Generations to enjoy speeding around as Shadow, as Sega also announced it is celebrating today's announcement by releasing a free equippable DLC costume to Sonic Superstars on February 15.\nSonic Superstars already includes several other skins you can equip onto your characters, ranging from Lego costumes to a Santa costume for Sonic to even the original prototype rabbit design. No screenshots or photos have been released for the newly announced Shadow costume in Sonic Superstars.\nIn July 2023, I asked Sonic Team creative officer Takashi Iizuka why Shadow isn't in Sonic Superstars. \"Shadow is from the Modern series of characters and gameplay that we have introduced,\" Iizuka says. \"The Classic series exists before the Modern series, so they haven't met at that time. There's no relationship, so we won't be bringing Shadow into the Classic series. Unfortunately, Shadow was in a capsule at that time.\"\nBy adding Shadow as an equippable skin, Iizuka and the rest of Sonic Team are able to circumvent the lore reasoning for leaving Shadow on the sidelines for Superstars. This year is shaping up to be the Year of Shadow for the Sonic brand. Shadow is coming to Sonic Superstars as an equippable skin, he's co-headlining the aforementioned Sonic Generations remaster in the fall, and he figures to be one of the main attractions in the upcoming Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film when that hits theaters in December.\nSonic Superstars launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on October 17, 2023. The free Shadow costume arrives in Sonic Superstars as free DLC on February 15. For more on that game, check out our review here. You can also visit our exclusive coverage hub by heading here.",

The news was announced during today’s State of Play.\nThe game, which first entered Steam Early Access in May 2022, puts players in the immortal shoes of a weak vampire who awakens after slumbering for centuries. Players must regain their strength and rebuild their castle, which, among other things, involves enslaving humans to do their bidding. Whatever your method of rebuilding your might and fending off foes, you’ll have to plan around a day/night cycle since sunlight is a big no-no for your well being. V Rising can be played alone or alongside friends in multiplayer. \n\n\nInterestingly, since Sony doesn't have an Early Access style program, one has to wonder if V Rising’s arrival will coincide with an impending 1.0 launch on PC.

          "description": "Hot on the heels of the latest Death Stranding 2 trailer during Sony's most recent State of Play livestream, Hideo Kojima, the head of Kojima Productions, announced that alongside Sony, his company is making a brand new IP. Not only that, but it is, as Kojima put it, an \"action espionage\" game.\nIf that genre sounds vaguely familiar in relation to Kojima, that might be because the tagline of his global breakthrough, Metal Gear Solid, released in 1998, used the tagline \"Tactical Espionage Action.\" In normal people's terms, that means a stealth game. \n\n\nKojima's return to the stealth genre, one he pioneered decades ago with the Metal Gear series, is still quite a ways off. As he tells it, development will begin in earnest after Death Stranding 2 is released sometime in 2025. \nHe then went on to say a bunch of stuff that didn't make a ton of sense, though maybe one day it will in retrospect. This new game will also apparently be a movie \"in terms of look, story, theme, cast, acting, fashion, and sound,\" Kojima said, before adding that with this new game, Kojima Productions hopes to \"transcend the barriers between film and video games.\"",

There wasn't much new in the trailer, but it does tease the action that awaits players when the full game launches this March. \nIn combat, various weapons can be used, including Japanese swords and spears. As you develop a connection with the inventor Igashichi, you'll gain more access to devices like the Fire Pipe, which is basically a long-range flamethrower. There are also bayonets, which can provide quick melee hits when using ranged weapons. \nRise of the Ronin takes place during the Bakumatsu period, and your connection with the people of Japan will greatly influence how your Ronin's story plays out.

Part of the game focuses on scuba diving and fishing, while another section of the game is about managing and growing a sushi restaurant, using the ingredients you gathered from the ocean. The game has a whimsical, lighthearted vibe and consistently entertaining gameplay, which together has garnered a lot of praise.\n\n\nAlongside the release on PlayStation consoles, we also got a tease of a new crossover coming to Dave the Diver, in which Godzilla shows up in the strange waters of the Blue Hole.

The trailer opens with Fragile and a friend, or someone very reminiscent of Fragile, performing surgery while a pair of additional hands cover her mouth. Later in the trailer she says, \"These days I am Fragile in name only,\" before explaining her efforts to create Drawbridge, which apparently was started when Sam went off on his own after the events of the first game.\n\n\nThe trailer also showcases the return of villain Higgs, who was teased in the first trailer. He wears a mask but removes it to reveal a face that looks like it belongs in The Crow. He tells Sam that it looks like he traded in rope for a stick this go 'round, recalling a major element of the original game which discussed how early humanity was faced with two tools in the beginning – one to create connection, and one to create conflict. Also, Higgs attacks enemies with a guitar.\n\nOther interesting elements of the trailer include discussions about the black goo from the universe of Death Stranding being a sort of primordial soup, the disappearance of Lou (the baby Sam carried with him in the first game), and a talking puppet that Sam carries on his hip. We also got a peak at Elle Fanning's character sneaking around and listening in on a surgery, but we know nothing else about her so far.\nThe trailer ended with the phrase, \"Should we have connected?\" and promised a 2025 release window, so we still have some time to wait. It also gave the PlayStation 5 exclusive game a proper subtitle: On The Beach.",

          "description": "In case you’ve been living under a rock, the monster-catching survival game Palworld is the hottest thing since sliced bread. As such, it’s only natural that players would want to take it anywhere they go; it’s currently only available on PC and Xbox Series X/S (via early access). However, mobile versions have recently been spotted, but you’ll want to think twice before downloading them.\nAn app posing as Palworld has appeared on Apple’s App Store and Google Play. In an X post, however, Palworld developer Pocketpair states that there is no official mobile version of Palworld. The app store version lists its developer as Oleksandra Kryvcun, which is the primary tip-off that something is amiss. Though not available, the app is available for pre-order and lists a February 11 launch date. \n[Warning]\nJanuary 31, 2024\nPocketpair warns that downloading this app may lead to your personal data being stolen. It states that it has reported these apps to Apple/Google. We couldn't find the fake Palworld on Google Play, so it may already be gone. Hopefully, the App Store fake is dealt with soon to protect eager players from installing something potentially nasty. \nPalworld has become the hottest (and most controversial) game of the year, and it remains to be seen if and when it will be brought to other platforms. Until then, you can catch up on all the excitement and discourse by reading our in-depth overview of what Palworld entails and our studio profile on developer Pocketpair from last year. You can also watch us play Palworld from the beginning in this episode of Game Informer Live.",

Weapons and playable characters alike undergo acute surges and declines based on several factors, with the most prevalent being player behavior. Years ago, Pathfinder reigned supreme across casual and competitive matches; his grapple hook-centric mobility and inconsistent hitbox made him an unrivaled duelist until his ability cooldowns and physique were tweaked. Similarly, the Prowler SMG once rivaled its light ammo counterparts before the Selectfire Receiver – a legendary hop-up that converted the weapon's burstfire to automatic – was removed from the loot pool.

There are many more things worth talking about, and this will be made more clear when we approach the release of 14.0. But for now, play the game, and please report any issues you find.
