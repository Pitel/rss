She’s a first-rate skateboarder and heartbreaker, returning to her hometown after ruining yet another relationship. Waiting for her are her parents, her incredibly strong Auntie, and a host of scorned lovers looking to even the score. Jala isn’t returning home on great terms, but untangling the mess she made when she left is what makes the characters of Thirsty Suitors shine so brightly.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

After all, although the current line-up of upcoming Switch games is certainly nothing to sneer at, there's no denying that Nintendo is leaning heavily on remakes and remasters, presumably while its core teams work on 'next-gen' titles. If that doesn't indicate a new console is on the horizon, we're not sure what does.\nAt the moment, the majority of us are under the assumption that the 'Switch 2' will be a reasonably 'safe' upgrade to the current console in general form and function; a hybrid device that retains the core concept of the Switch but beefs up the performance considerably while possibly adding a few new innovations here and there. It makes sense, right? Although many of us are eager to move on to the next big thing, Nintendo isn't ready to ditch the Switch brand, and none of us want it to. It still works wonderfully after all these years, so why do anything drastically different?\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The last title to feature the onion-layered ogre was DreamWorks Super Star Kartz, released by Activision in 2011 for the Wii, Xbox 360, PS3, and 3DS. It’s somewhat fitting, then, that he would return in another DreamWorks karting game, and equally fitting that it too feels two generations old.\nDreamWorks All-Star Kart Racing is the latest offering from Bamtang Games, which was previously responsible for the Nickelodeon Kart Racers trilogy (which started weak on Switch, got better with the second game then lost its way again with the final entry).

Many of his ideas for 2022's finest historical fantasy RPG have their twitching, eldritch roots in pen-and-paper sessions with friends. Take questions of money and wealth. Speaking to me over Zoom one rainy October afternoon, Aureus recalls one particular table-top campaign he ran in which, after 10 or so sessions, the player party had sunk into abject poverty. \"They reached a collapsed village, [and] they said, 'is there a cart around here?' So I rolled the dice and decided that all right, there is a wagon, that's completely functional with all its wheels and so on. So they just started to walk around and shove on the top of their wagon, whatever of value they could find. \r\n\n\r\n\"They had no shame!\" Aureus goes on. \"Just gathering all the scraps of iron, all the tools, knives, musical instruments, pieces of fabric - anything they could find, they were just taking it all with them on the assumption that whenever they reached a civilised spot, they're just going to sell it all.\"  This was foolhardy behaviour, because all the objects in question were trash with little resale value. \"So they at the same time they had more than they could ever need, and they had pretty much nothing. They mainly had a hindrance that was slowing them down - this wagon full of stuff was just difficult to move through the paths.\" \r\n\n \nRead more",

In news worth holding the press for, he thinks they're pretty cheap for what you get in return.\nZelnick cautioned one investor against \"generalising\" about the state of game pricing based on the recent fortunes of TV and movie subscription services like Netflix, which have had to increase subscription fees to match their expenses after underpricing themselves initially to grow their audiences. Videogames might be all about subscription services these days, Zelnick said, but that doesn't mean they are subject to the same commercial logics as ye olde non-interactive media. In particular, it doesn't mean publishers are currently able to raise videogame prices, even if they feel like they're overdelivering.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Still, sometimes these glimpses and ideas are interesting enough that I quite enjoy trying to figure them out.

Apparently it's such a great game that the only way to achieve a similar high after being banned is hijacking a schoolbus and forcing teenagers to kill each other.\nHere's a fun (nonlethal) game we can play together, reader dear: I'm going to describe Gods Of Combat as best I can, then you tell me how you think it works.\nRead more",

          "description": "As a staunch Nintendo head in the early console days, I would say my affection for PS1-era games is... present, but not particularly palpable. For me, the PlayStation One was mostly a machine to play Final Fantasies VII through IX on, and not much else (it was a very belated and cheap second-hand purchase, I should note, and games were still sufficiently expensive back then that maintaining two healthy game libraries for both the family N64 and my new Squall box was nigh on impossible). Nevertheless, I've been increasingly fascinated by the revival of PS1-era games in recent years, and it's been interesting to see which modern games have been \"demade\" in this style - see Bloodborne PSX - and which ones have made it their own from the off - see Signalis, Heartworm, and many others. \nCrow Country is the latest game I've seen to take up the PSX mantle, and it combines the chunkiness of Final Fantasy VII-style character models with the grimy survival horror of something like Resident Evil to brilliant effect. Made by SFB Games, the same devs wot made the also excellent Tangle Tower, it's currently got a very good demo up on Steam at the moment, and it's got me thinking: what do you like most about PS1-era games on PC, and which ones are your all-time favs?\nRead more",

The Heroic edition gives you all that plus a mount, a pet and extra in-game cash. And then there's the most expensive Epic edition, which includes a pet, two toys, 30 days of game time... and three days of early beta access to the game, yours for $89.99 in the states. \r\n\n\r\nNaturally, World of Warcrafters are rather concerned about the last bit. It's the first time Blizzard's long-running MMO has taken the paid early access approach, recently adopted by Starfield and Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 - there have been early access betas in the past, but they've been doled out by lottery. Blizzard's game director Ion Hazzikostas has now moved to reassure the grousers and gripers, promising that The War Within's Epic edition won't give minted early worms the edge over those poor peasants who scoop up the less pricey versions.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Its reveal was a surprise, mind – haven’t Valve repeatedly said that there wouldn’t be another new Steam Deck for ages?\r\n\n\r\nNot quite. That warning was always qualified in that a more powerful Deck was still a ways off, and the Steam Deck OLED’s performance improvements are both tiny and a likely incidental result of its efficiency savings. This very point was repeated to me in an interview with Valve designer Jay Shaw and software engineer Jeremy Selan, which also covered the Steam Deck family’s future, its current struggles with intensive big-budget games, and why they want \"more, more, more\" rivals like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go.\r\n\n \nRead more",

As great a handheld gaming PC as the original Steam Deck is, its slightly bland IPS display and short battery life are some definite weak points – points to which newer, shinier rivals, such as the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go, have been happy to apply pressure.\nValve are keen to stress that this OLED-equipped model represents an update, not a whole generational switcheroo. Yet there’s much, much more behind that screen that just some different diodes. This is a lighter, brighter, longer-lasting, sometimes even faster-running take on the SteamOS handheld, and one that sneaks in some surprise upgrades as often as it addresses issues with the original Steam Deck.

As he makes clear to his army of Russian ultranationalists, he is interested only in their quiet, unwavering loyalty. Evidently, Activision expects much the same from its army of COD fans. This latest Modern Warfare campaign follows disconcertedly close on the heels of 2022’s entry because, as per Bloomberg, it began life as a mere expansion. Rather than allow a fallow year, Activision has upgraded that expansion’s status to a premium release, and charged $69.99 for pre-orders - granting early access to the single-player campaign as an enticement.\r\n\n\r\nInstead of Modern Warfare’s usual lead studio, Infinity Ward, development duties have fallen to Sledgehammer, the outfit most recently responsible for 2021’s unloved Vanguard. And in an industry where AAA FPS games now regularly take half a decade to make, this campaign has reportedly come together in less than two years. Reader: it shows.\r\n\n \nRead more",

A faked death finally saw him freed from the shackles of the yakuza with one big catch: he couldn't ever see his family again. Since then, we've had the plucky Ichiban take on the mantle of Tojo Clan nastiness in Yakuza: Like A Dragon (7), with its sequel Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth (8) set to wash up on Hawaii's shores next year. What do we know about Infinite Wealth? Kiryu is set to return as a protagonist alongside Ichiban, with an all-new haircut. And more importantly, what has Like A Dragon Gaiden got to do with any of this? Well, it's a shorter stop-gap between the events of Yakuza 6 and Yakuza 8 that fills us in on what Kiryu's been up to this whole time.\nBut aside from moreish minigames and a fantastic Agent persona with web-slinging abilities, Kiryu's epilogue is a far cry from Yakuza's best stories. By no means is it bad, it just isn't the best introduction to the series for newcomers, and even longtime fans will struggle balancing his resurrection with its heavy feelings of repetition.\nRead more",

I want someone who really, really loves and hates things, and gives you reasons why.”\nIt’s a trait which Giovannetti has in common with his Megacrit co-founder, Casey Yano, and has possessed ever since he was a kid growing up in Woodinville, 30 minutes outside Seattle. It’s matched by a competitiveness that first emerged in Warhammer 40,000 tournaments as a teen.

Echoing his relatively guarded enthusiasm for NFTs a couple of years ago, he’s sort of mixed on them, regarding AI tools less as transformative technologies than simply the latest step towards the eternal industry objective of More, Faster And Better For Less.\nZelnick thinks automated learning and generation tools will make development more “efficient” and games, overall “better”, but in terms of Take-Two’s own bottom line, any gains will likely be offset by the fact that other big companies have access to the same tools, and by the fact that Take-Two will take advantage of said efficiencies by setting more ambitious goals. As such, he doesn’t think using generative AI will lead to lower prices for big commercial games. If you’re a developer that can’t afford to buy or license generative “AI” tools, Zelnick added, you can expect competition to become “more intense” in the coming years. Good stuff. \nRead more",

          "description": "As regular readers of this column will know, I'm a big fan of OLED TVs and monitors. One of my favourites is Dell's Alienware AW3423DWF, a 34-inch ultrawide that offers a fairly standard 3440x1440 165Hz spec - but its QD-OLED panel makes for a night-and-day difference against your standard VA and IPS panel alternatives, with perfect contrast, near-instant pixel response times, gorgeous colour reproduction and stunning HDR. \nIt normally retails for around £929, but today it's down to £739 when you use the code GROUPON8 at Dell UK. That's about as cheap as we've ever seen it, and well worth it for anyone that wants a monitor primarily for gaming rather than content creation or mixed purposes. \nRead more",

          "description": "Hallowe’en may be over (just), but for this month’s Reality Frights, I’ve got a wonderfully seasonal game for you. It’s the brand-new remake of the grand old mystery puzzler The 7th Guest, a game which Bill Gates notably referred to as “The new standard of interactive entertainment.” In fairness to ol’ William, he said this seven months before Doom blew out the new standard’s insides with a 12-gauge shotgun, shunting PC gamers’ tastes away from kitsch adventure games and toward grisly murder-fests. But The 7th Guest is nonetheless fondly remembered for its spooky atmosphere, alongside its blend of pre-rendered backgrounds and live action cutscenes you could call ‘pioneering’ had it not proved such an evolutionary dead end.\nToday, the original 7th Guest looks more dated than Henry VIII, which is probably why this remake replaces everything but the very skeleton of the 1993 original. The game still takes place in a creepy mansion belonging to a murderous toymaker, and still involves six eccentric guests to the house searching for a missing boy named Tad. But it’s otherwise been completely rebuilt, with whole new puzzles and whole new mechanics, all designed to be experienced in first-person VR.\nRead more",

I've long admired their intricate dances of orbs and criss-crossing laser fire, but I have long resigned myself to merely being a spectator of such games, rather than an active ship pilot. Cobalt Core, however, is exactly my kind of speed. It's not a bullet hell shooter, but it is about two spaceships facing off against each other in an eyes-locked duel of incoming cannon fire, and sliding side to side to avoid getting exploded as you attempt to unravel the mysterious timeloop your crew of weird space animals appear to be stuck in. Just, you know, in a neat, turn-based fashion, where your opponent's attacks are flagged up in advance, and you must use your randomised deck of cards to weave and dodge your way to victory. It's very moreish, and very Into The Breach. I love it. \nRead more",

You're not fooling me, Croteam. I'm here to solve puzzles and discuss philosophy, and I know you are too. You can't stop talking about philosophy in this game, and frankly, I wouldn't have it any other way. \nMillenia may have passed since the events of The Talos Principle, but the problems faced by this new society of advanced robo-humans (of which you are number 1000 to be 'born' into this world) still feel all too relevant to the issues posed by the lives we're living today: what is the price of progress? Will we ignore the mistakes of the past and push the world toward irreparable destruction? And why have cats remained loyal to this new race of robo-people, cementing their status as the superior future pet, when dogs have devolved back into vicious wolves?

It was a game in which every footfall felt like a gamble and every second lasted an eternity, even before you entered the lair of a giant spider. Fast  forward to 2023, and streamers are playing Hunt: Showdown like it's Titanfall 2, scurrying along walls with scant regard for the NPC cannon fodder below, duelling each other on rooftops with pistol shotguns, and tearing through those poor, befuddled boss monsters like sandcastles.\r\n\n\r\nThus the fate of any competitive shooter lucky enough to acquire a seasoned pro following, I guess. But still, returning to Crytek's PvPvE shooter has been a shock, and speaking to the development team, it sounds like the devs themselves have been struggling to keep up with the more ambitious players, too. Showdown was never expected to endure quite this long and evolve in quite this way, according to general manager David Fifield, and managing the community's ambitions for the game is as much of a challenge as compensating for the limitations of its ageing engine.\r\n\n \nRead more",

In the dozens of open beta matches I've played, the result is as thrilling as those other games, but also exhausting. I wish it would chill for just a moment so I could fully enjoy its delights - of which there are many.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Final Fantasy XIV’s world of Eorzea is a utopia. Sure, there’s the looming threat of Garlean invasion and/or the possibility of world destruction throughout A Realm Reborn and its expansions - but on the plus side, almost everyone you meet is up for a round of cards.\r\n\n\r\nOver the last quarter-century, Triple Triad has managed to escape its origins as a fun side minigame in Final Fantasy VIII to become a fully-fledged phenomenon in XIV. The Gold Saucer runs regular tournaments, random strangers are happy to be challenged to a match - often throwing in one or more of the game’s many variant rules (though Chaos can do one) - and might even give up one of their prized cards when defeated, with almost 400 to collect as of the game’s latest patches. Emphasis on the “might”: I dread to think of the hours spent replaying NPCs in the hope of a random drop as I filled out my collection.\r\n\nI headed along to Final Fantasy’s London Fan Fest last month with a fetching deck of Triple Triad cards in hand. (Square Enix provided entrance and accommodation for the event.) Where better to try and live the dream of challenging random strangers to a card game, and learn more about the community that has fallen in love with the MMO in the 10 years since A Realm Reborn released?\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I have a confession to make, readers. I'm mildly obsessed with Starfield's cuboid food brand Chunks. In all honesty, I'm kinda obsessed with Starfield's food in a more general sense, and I have almost as many screenshots of its tube-like meal boxes, stale toast slices, vacuum-packed sachets of rice balls, steak slabs and spiced worms - and, of course, Chunks - as I do its planets and NPCs. I'm weirdly fascinated by what Bethesda think our future meals will look like when we eventually start travelling across the stars, and not just because I like ragging on their somewhat plastic-looking textures and marvelling at how everything from orange juice to beer and wine comes in kid's size cartons with a little straw on the side. \nChunks are my favourite food of the lot, though. These cubes of faintly glistening organic matter are bite-sized monstrosities that are quite possibly some of the most unholy things I've ever seen. How this became the dominating foodstuff across the known galaxy is a mystery worthy of its own sidequest, because let's be honest, I'm all for eating wonky fruit and vegetables, but would you truly go to shop, sit down at a table and order an apple that's been squeezed into a perfect cube? Or a cube with yellow skin that professes to call itself grilled chicken? I would probably try them once for curiosity's sake (it's the food of the future, of course I want to know what that tastes like!), but it's also exactly the kind of thing I'd swear off immediately because nope, nuh uh, I just can't even contemplate it anymore. And then it dawned on me: this is exactly how I feel about Starfield as a whole.\nRead more",

Amidst the lively conversation, Patricia Summersett, who voices Zelda in Tears of the Kingdom, has stated that she would love to return to her role in the upcoming movie. \n\n\nIn an interview with GamesRadar+, Summersett reveals just how attached she has grown to her role since she voiced in Breath of the Wild. Though she's voiced the princess in three games already, including Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, she claims she \"could always take more of it.\" Of course, this doesn't mean that her return has been confirmed in the upcoming movie, as the cast list has yet to be revealed. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\nThe Legend of Zelda movie\n\n\nEarlier this year, there were rumors that a The Legend of Zelda movie is in the works courtesy of Illumination. The rumors were proven false, though they did correctly predict that Nintendo is working on adapting its highly successful franchise. \n\n\nThe movie is being directed by Maze Runner's Wes Ball, and it will be produced by Pikmin creator Shigeru Miyamoto and Avi Arad who is chairman of Arad Productions Inc. Somewhat surprisingly, the film is receiving financing from Sony Pictures Entertainment, though more than 50% will be financed by Nintendo. \n\n\nWith no DLC planned for Tears of the Kingdom, the announced movie is something for fans to look forward to if they're searching for their next big dose of Zelda. No release date has been given yet. \n\nThe post Zelda voice actor “would love to” reprise her role in upcoming The Legend of Zelda movie appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "There’s plenty to appreciate in Alan Wake 2 including the clever use of music and lyrics. One catchy song in particular has been popular enough to inspire a fan-made music video for it. Some mild spoilers are ahead.\n\n\nIn Initiation 4: We Sing, Alan finds himself in a weird musical featuring Sam Lake, Mr Door, and the Old Gods of Asgard. The chapter mixes live action with animation, and it provides lyrics so that you can sing along while catching up on the plot thus far. An unofficial video has been made by blending different scenes from throughout the game. It’s done so brilliantly that you’d swear it was an official music video from Remedy.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\nMusic in Alan Wake 2\n\n\nThe song, called 'Herald of Darkness', is performed by the Finnish band Poets of the Fall who appear as the fictional band Old Gods of Asgard in the Alan Wake franchise. They play a pivotal role in Alan Wake 2 by helping Saga perform a summoning ritual near Cauldron Lake. The band's songs also contain lyrics that are relevant to the game. \n\n\n\n\nAlan Wake isn’t the only game where Remedy has gone crazy with music. In Control, the soundtrack helps to set the atmosphere, and the Ashtray Maze in particular offers an unforgettable blend of music and game to keep your adrenaline pumping.\n\n\n\n\n'Herald of Darkness' is hitting major streaming sites, including Spotify and Apple Music, on November 15. On December 8, you’ll be able to pick up the Old Gods of Asgard Rebirth - Greatest Hits album. It contains songs from the band found in the Alan Wake series and Control.\n\n\nWe may still get to hear more from the band, as Remedy has DLC planned for Alan Wake 2. The first offering, Night Springs, is scheduled to launch in Spring 2024.\n\nThe post There’s an amazing fan-made video for Alan Wake 2’s Herald of Darkness song appeared first on Destructoid.",

Its first major checkpoint? A short discussion of Seekers of the Storm's main villain, the ominous-sounding False Son.\n\n\nMore specifically, Gearbox's first official Risk of Rain 2: Seekers of the Storm developer diary is about the DLC's all-new final boss and the lore behind its existence. Though lore hasn't historically been a huge draw in Risk of Rain or its highly acclaimed sequel, Risk of Rain 2, it's worth highlighting that the franchise has a significant narrative backlog going in the background of all the killing.

Certain characters, like Fischl, can summon creatures to fight for them. Fischl can summon a crow familiar named Oz, who stays on-field and deals damage. There are others, too, like Kokomi, who summons a jellyfish, and Xiangling, who summons a small bear named Guoba.

          "description": "Zagreus has found his new home: Netflix. Revealed during Netflix Geeked Week, Supergiant Games' Hades is coming to Netflix's gaming service in 2024.\n\n\n\n\nThe 2020 roguelike is joining the ranks of Immortality, Spiritfarer, and Oxenfree as one of the available games in the service. Netflix Gaming is free for all Netflix subscribers, so owners of the streaming giant can play at no extra cost. The announcement also came with the news that Braid, Death's Door, and Katana Zero would be added in 2024.\n\n\nIt's in the Blood\n\n\nHades follows the son of the titular ruler of the underworld, Zagreus, as he tries to escape the Underworld. With the help of the gods of Olympus, you die, die, and die again as you battle through ever-changing maps. Upon its release on Switch and PC, the game was lauded for its character design and addicting roguelike gameplay.\n\n\nOur own Jordan Devore rated the game a 9/10, citing Supergiant Games' strong storytelling and stellar RPG combat. Hades was nominated for multiple Game of the Year awards and even won Destructoid's own Overall Best Game of 2020. \n\n\nI played the heck out of Hades when it was on Game Pass. Seeing it made available for all Netflix subscribers is a joy. Now, more people can play this stellar game whenever and wherever they want. It's a trip to Hell I am down to go to.\n\n\nThe timing for Hades to come to Netflix is pretty coincidental, as Supergiant Games is expanding the universe next year with Hades II. The game, which made its way onto my RPGs to look out for, follows Zagreus' sister, Melinoë. Instead of her father, she'll face the Titan of Time alongside new faces. The game is set to go Early Access in Q2 of 2024 for PC. While it's set to release on consoles, no specifics were given.\n\nThe post Beloved roguelike Hades is joining Netflix’s gaming service appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The adventures of Lara Croft are looking quite promising. As part of Netflix Geeked Week, Legendary Entertainment released a behind-the-scenes look at the Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft series.\n\n\nPowerhouse Animation Studios, known for its Castlevania series, is taking on the daring archaeologist with the help of Legendary Entertainment. Based on Crystal Dynamics' reboots/prequels, Netflix's Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft sets up the Lara seen in the 1996 original. The video, narrated by Character Design Supervisor Joy Lua, showcases the globe-trotting journeys we'll see her take, as well as some callbacks to different games.\n\n\n\n\nTomb Raider steps out of the shadows for Netflix\n\n\nThe video starts with some drawings and rough storyboard scenes, previewing some of the show's worldwide action. We see Lara snowboarding off a parachute and traversing buildings in Paris like an action hero. As Lara in the reboot trilogy usually stayed in one country, it's cool to see her out and about. \n\n\nConcepts for the places she'll go (yes, including tombs) are shown toward the end. She'll also sport some new gear, donning a dress in one shot and snow gear in another. Of course, she'll have her bow, pickaxe, and pistols alongside her. The team aims to provide many Easter eggs for longtime fans and bridge the gap between old and new. \n\n\nWhile the animated Netflix series picks up after Shadow of the Tomb Raider, reboot era Lara voice actress Camilla Luddington of Grey's Anatomy is not reprising her role, with Marvel the MCU's Agent Carter, Haley Atwell, picking up the dual pistols. Jonah, played by Earl Baylon, is back and given a small look via concept art. As a fan of Castlevania and Powerhouse, as well as the reboots, it seems like Lara is in good hands.\n\n\nTomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft is slated to release sometime in 2024. \n\nThe post New Tomb Raider show gets behind-the-scenes look appeared first on Destructoid.",

The panel is set to feature George Wada, the president of Production I.G. and Wit Studio; Hiro Kaburagi, the director of Great Pretender; and Hitoshi Ito, the anime’s producer.

Feels very Diablo-y to me.\n\n\nFor the roster, I see a few expected faces, including leads like Callum and Rayla. I'm admittedly a bit behind on the show, but it's nice to see the breadth of choices here. The shield-toting Amaya is a very welcome inclusion, too.\n\n\nNetflix and games\n\n\nThe online streaming giant Netflix has been steadily making headway in the realm of games. It has a mobile service which has featured access to some notable titles, like 2018 gem Spiritfarer.\n\n\nThe company's also making its own big push into games, through internal measures and external acquisitions of studios like Spry Fox and Oxenfree maker Night School Studio. Joseph Staten, of Halo/343 fame, was even brought on as Netflix Games' creative director.\n\n\nIt does seem like Netflix continues to be interested in games, both on their own and as properties for streaming shows. Whether these efforts pan out will be interesting to see, but it's at least a good sign that Netflix's game service has eschewed the microtransactions that typically plague mobile offerings. Because of that, this Dragon Prince ARPG on-the-go could be one to watch.\n\nThe post Netflix’s The Dragon Prince is getting a Diablo-esque mobile game appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Xbox console versions of Baldur's Gate 3 are on their way. And it looks like the optimizations made for the Xbox Series S version of BG3 may have some benefits for other platforms, too.\n\n\nLarian Studios head Swen Vincke shared a look at some graphs for the upcoming port of Baldur's Gate 3. Notably, the graphs highlight how the optimizations being made are addressing an overall Baldur's Gate 3 speedbump: memory.\n\n\n\"Ensuring memory is well under control and having buffer for peaks was the main thing holding us back I think this will benefit all platforms too,\" Vincke writes. \"Still some work left but very close now.\"\n\n\n\n\nA new horizon for Baldur's Gate 3\n\n\nThe Xbox Series versions of Baldur's Gate 3 are still coming along but planned for this year. While the massive RPG hit PC and PS5 earlier this year, the Xbox version was held off for some time, citing concerns about the Series S, a compromise was finally reached: allowing the Series S version to launch without split-screen co-op.\n\n\nWhile the issues initially surrounded parity, seeing as the Series S is a step behind both the Series X and PlayStation 5, it looks like optimizing that port might be beneficial for all. The improvements in VRAM and RAM shown above definitely seem enticing, and if this makes my PC run BG3 better, then I'm all for it.\n\n\nPlus, it means many more people will be able to play Baldur's Gate 3. Despite a frankly crowded year for big releases, Larian's RPG has been a huge hit for players, including myself. Getting Baldur's Gate 3 on Xbox Series S consoles, and optimizing it more in the process, seems like a real win-win.\n\nThe post Larian shares an update on Baldur’s Gate 3 Xbox Series S optimization appeared first on Destructoid.",

The studio has confirmed that Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time is being pushed into 2024.\n\n\nThe team says it's pushing the Switch game back to ensure Fantasy Life i is released \"in better quality to everyone.\" No firm release date for next year's been set, but we'll be hearing about it soon. Level-5 is holding another Vision 2023 event later this month on November 29, where it plans to announce the new release date for Fantasy Life i.\n\n\n\n\nWhat's ahead for Level-5\n\n\nConsidering a number of Level-5's other projects are all still labeled 2023—and we're running out of 2023 with each day that passes—I wouldn't be surprised to see some other windows shift. If anything's left to launch this year, there's not a lot of time left.\n\n\nThat said, this reinvigorated Level-5 is exciting to see come together. While the studio's been largely working on properties like Ni no Kuni and Yo-Kai Watch for the last few years, they've now got a hefty lineup of both familiar and fresh games. One in particular, Decapolice, has really caught my eye, and reportedly looked good at Tokyo Game Show 2023.\n\n\nMy hope is that Level-5 gets the time to comfortably make what they want to. This studio produces some wild, wonderful worlds that are a blast to explore, and both Fantasy Life i and its other games look really intriguing.

On that note, Samurai Punk—the studio behind several indie games including Killbug and Screencheat—has announced its closure in a post via Twitter.\n\n\n\n\nIn the post, the team celebrates an impressive decade-long run as a studio, and notes that “it’s been an amazing run and we’d like to thank our team past and present; the 9 incredible games we’ve made wouldn’t have been possible without them.” \n\n\nIn speaking of the team, Samurai Punk has created a Google doc with the information for those affected by this closure. “These incredible folks will now be looking for new roles, so if you have roles available or know of any openings, please contact us or the individuals directly.”\n\n\nSamurai Punk was established in 2014, and is responsible for Screencheat, as well as The American Dream, Feather, Roombo: First Blood, and Killbug, among others. It is by no means the only studio that has suffered a closure in 2023 — some examples include Dillon’s Rolling Western developer Vanpool, Boomerang X developer Dang!, and the Embracer Group-owned Volition Games, who made Saints Row.\n\n\nIt genuinely hurts me to hear news like this, especially when games like Screencheat somehow manage to fly under my radar all this time.

It’s set to release on PC sometime in 2024.\n\n\nHollywood Animal is a narrative management sim where you try to run a movie studio with as few scruples as possible. Manage staff through gifts or blackmail, create movies to gain favors, but just keep things as profitable as possible. Craft art, build stars, or simply find their dark spots so you can stick a hook in and make them dance. All this is covered in the absolutely fantastic announcement trailer.\n\n\n\n\nI don’t remember the last time I saw a game trailer that superb.\n\n\nHollywood Animal is being billed as a narrative-first game, but includes all the standard management hooks. By the looks of all the systems show off, it’s really quite complex. It takes you through the ages as you try to keep your studio afloat while not bringing too much attention to your shady dealings. Select the director, the writers, and the actors, and then try to keep them all happy (or at least complacent). Navigate the changing political landscape of the ages.\n\n\nI am so on board with this. I’ve wanted a good movie studio simulator for a while, or at least a re-release of 2005’s The Movies.

          "description": "This year has seen a slew of studios and gaming companies face significant layoffs, and it doesn't seem like things are set to slow down soon. It appears Unity may be the next to suffer layoffs as it attempts to become a \"leaner, more agile, and faster growing company.\"\n\n\nIn a shareholder letter, Unity CEO James Whitehurst claims that the company has a big opportunity to grow in the future, though that may be difficult at present because the team is trying to do too much at once. As Whitehurst explains, \"we are not achieving the synergies that exist across our portfolio, and we are not executing to our full potential.\" \n\n\nThird-quarter financial results are described as \"mixed.\" The strategy to make the company leaner will include increasing focus on its main projects such as the Unity Editor. Though nothing is set in stone yet, the plan will likely involve discontinuing certain products, reducing the business's office footprint, and reducing the size of the workforce. \n\n\nThe letter also addressed the controversy surrounding the announcement of runtime fees. Whitehurst acknowledges that \"the execution created friction with our customers and near-term headwinds.\" Despite this, there's no indication of any intentions to back down. The event is described as \"now mostly behind us,\" though it is expected that because of the controversy, the new business model will be minimally beneficial in 2024 until customers adopt Unity's new releases.\n\n\nNo date is given regarding when these interventions will be implemented but further guidance will come with the fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. \n\nThe post Unity warns of likely layoffs following runtime fee decision appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, that's all about to change as the game's creator Jonathan Blow has recently announced an Anniversary Edition coming in 2024.\n\n\nReleasing April 30, this new version of Braid comes with improved visuals and animations, areas that have been \"re-envisioned to make them more unique,\" and more than 15 hours of commentary. If you're interested in the world game development, that last one may be of interest to you.\n\n\n\n\nThis special Anniversary Edition – which is launching to celebrate 15 years of Braid – is coming to PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, iOS, Android, and even Netflix. It'll also be available on PS4 and Xbox One, with Linux and Mac ports coming later on.\n\n\nConsidered a \"masterpiece\"\n\n\nOriginally released on Xbox 360 in 2008, Braid has been described as one of the greatest independent games of its generation. It won several awards and was the second-largest-selling game on Xbox Live Arcade. It has a Metacritic score of 93.\n\n\nIts developer Blow is no stranger to the video game world. Some of his earlier work includes being a programmer on Oddworld: Munchy's Oddysee and Deus Ex: Invisible War. He released the puzzle title The Witness in 2016.\n\n\nHe's also gained something of a reputation over the years, often being held aloft as an outspoken critic of the gaming industry. He was described in a 2016 New Yorker article as a \"prickly genius,\" while an interview with Kotaku in 2011 said Blow's opinions are not aimed at individuals, but at \"trends.\" He's also no stranger to making public controversial statements over the years, further complicating his legacy.\n\n\nIn any case, Braid is often signposted as an indie release that helped shape an industry of indie releases. This was before Minecraft did it. If you still haven't played the game (guilty), April's Anniversary Edition is definitely one to look out for.\n\nThe post Braid current-gen release coming April to celebrate 15th anniversary appeared first on Destructoid.",

While most publishers would have buried it and moved on, the creative team got to work and the funding arrived to salvage the game. To celebrate, in-game events are on the way.\n\n\nFallout 76 5-year anniversary event details\n\n\nWe're not getting a massive quality of life overhaul or DLC per se, but there will be a streaming event on Twitch on Tuesday November 14 at 3PM ET, as well as a birthday event from now through November 21 at 12PM ET.\n\n\nHere is the full rundown of the stream from Bethesda:\n\n\n\n\"Organized by our friends at Fallout for Hope, we have over 40 floats, live music, Atom giveaways and more!

(No, seriously, look him up we love his voice!)\"\n\n\n\n\nFallout 76 is in good company, alongside No Man's Sky and Final Fantasy XIV (1.0)\n\n\nWhile there was no excuse for the state it was launched in, Fallout 76 gets high marks on its report card in the BUG (bring-up-grades) section. The team actually committed to making the game better, and while it took nearly two years to add NPCs (the turning point for 76), they came all the same.

          "description": "Destiny 2 is currently in a rough spot. Player morale is at an all-time low, tanking after a round of Bungie layoffs and news of a reported delay for the upcoming The Final Shape expansion. And while Bungie is using the delay to double down on ensuring the new expansion is a smash hit, serious concerns about Destiny's longevity are cropping up. Even if The Final Shape proves to be everything Bungie promises, inescapable factors persist against the game.\n\n\nBut the situation didn't get like this overnight. Bungie's decisions reportedly came after noting the title's yearly revenue would fall 45% below expectations. That sharp decline is symptomatic of issues that have been building for years. And with player sentiment where it is, alongside a projected content drought and a perceived \"endpoin…",

          "description": "With the Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer announcement being made recently, all eyes are once again on Rockstar's behemoth franchise. Not that eyes were ever truly off it. GTA 5 is still doing phenomenally well, as outlined in Take-Two Interactive's recent figures.\n\n\nAccording to conference call notes uploaded a couple of days ago, Grand Theft Auto 5 has now sold approximately 190 million units since it launched in 2013. Compare this to November 2022's prepared remarks – when it had sold 170 million – and it's obvious the game is still selling in droves.\n\n\nAt this rate, it could well fly past the 200 million mark, maintaining its stance as the second highest-selling game after Minecraft (which recently hit 300 million).\n\n\nBetter be worth the wait\n\n\nGTA 6 is still pretty elusive. Aside from the leak in 2022, we really don't know much about the hugely anticipated follow-up. Rockstar has promised the first official trailer in December, so at least we have that to look forward to.\n\n\nIt's a tall order to be the next big thing after Grand Theft Auto 5, but after years of speculations, leaks, and the collective will of gamers everywhere, the world is finally ready for the next installment.\n\n\nIt's tempting to say that once the sixth game comes out, sales of GTA 5 may slow down significantly. However, Rockstar's not above rehashing some of its older (and more lucrative) titles, so who knows what the studio has planned for the game. There's still some milking to be done for that proverbial cash cow.\n\nThe post GTA 5 is getting closer to 200 million units sold appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It's pretty well known that Bethesda nearly had a voiced protagonist in Starfield. The developer decided against it in the end. However, did you know that one of those actors could well have been the voice behind Adam Jensen?\n\n\nIn a recent post on Twitter/X, Elias Toufexis, who takes on the role of the main character in the two most recent Deus Ex games, said he was originally going to voice the Starfield hero.\n\n\n\n\nHe also said that Cissy Jones – another prolific video game voice artist – was originally planned to play the protagonist, presumably the female version. However, while Bethesda did scrap the idea in the end, we did still get to hear both actors, with Toufexis playing Sam Coe and Jones playing Andreja.\n\n\nWould it have been better?\n\n\nWith the exception of Fallout 4, Bethesda games typically have a silent main character. Many argue this helps with immersion. It could also be a time, money, and labor-saving decision at the hands of the studio.\n\n\nIn any case, Starfield having a mute protagonist is par for the course for Todd Howard and his team. We could be looking at a different experience if we had Toufexis' gravelly dialogue guiding us through the cosmos.\n\n\nDespite major hype for the game, Starfield doesn't feel like it has the staying power of something like Skyrim. It's still a good sci-fi game – and the continuous updates will only improve things – but it might be a stretch to think of it as a potential Bethesda classic in years to come.\n\nThe post Starfield very nearly had you playing as the voice of Deus Ex’s Adam Jensen appeared first on Destructoid.",

With only a year and a half to work on the game, development was fraught with issues, Schreier's sources reveal. \n\n\nAs Schreier explains, MW3 was originally pitched as a DLC, but the game was suddenly turned into a standalone title to fill in a gap in the company's release schedule after another 2023 CoD game planned for this year was delayed. This has been denied by an Activision spokesperson, but Schreier insists that \"more than a dozen current and former Call of Duty developers said that conflicts with what they were told at the time.\"\n\n\n\n\nAs you can imagine, having such a short development time required many Sledgehammer employees to work long hours, includin…",

Resident Evil Village hit the App Store just last week, and today, Capcom has let us know when Resident Evil 4 Remake is coming to the platform: December 20. You can see some screenshots from the Apple port below. \n\nThe game won't be available to all iPhone owners, however. Resident Evil 4 Remake will only be available on the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, meaning you'll have to grab the newest product in order to play this game on the go. That said, it will also be available on iPads and Macs with the M1 chip or later. If you're a diehard Apple fan and have multiple RE4 Remake compatible products, you'll be happy to know that the game also supports cross-progression between Apple devices, so you can start a save file on your Mac at home and pick it up on your phone when you're on the go.\nThe game is available for pre-order on the App Store now, but players will be able to start the game for free before committing to a full purchase. Its recently released DLC, Separate Ways, will launch alongside it as well. While we haven't been able to go hands-on with this version of the game quite yet, we like Resident Evil 4 Remake quite a lot: you can read our review for it right here.",

That means users will no longer be able to directly upload screenshots and video clips from the console to the social media site.\nAn announcement update posted to the PlayStation Support page states that on Monday, November 13, X integration will end, which includes the ability to “view any content published on X on PS5/PS4, and the ability to post and view content, trophies, and other gameplay-related activities on X directly from PS5/PS4 (or link an X account to do so).”\nWhile a bummer for those who make frequent use of this feature, which offers a simple method of posting gameplay content to the platform, there are a couple of more involved alternatives depending on your platform. If you’re a PS5 user, you can still use the PlayStation mobile app to upload gameplay captures to then post on X. You can read how to do that here. PS4 users have to rely on ShareFactory and do a bit more work, and you can read those steps here.\nMicrosoft made the same move in April by disabling sharing to X directly from the console and instructing players to instead use the Xbox app on mobile (with some speculating the decision was made to avoid paying the platform's then-new monthly application programming interface (API) fee). This now means that the Switch will become the sole console that supports direct media sharing to X. \nWhat do you think about the decision to end X integration? Did you use this feature regularly?

Humanity's story reflects real-world events, showing us the paths we're currently on.\nWatch The Documentary:\n\n\n\"Soon after we began making Humanity, a number of big events and movements broke out around the world,\" Enhance founder and CEO Tetsuya Mizuguchi tells us. \"There were human rights movements, the Hong Kong protests, [and] then there was the pandemic. And war soon followed in Ukraine. We had no idea how quickly and deeply AI would infiltrate our society either. I think all these things found their way into the core of Humanity. That question, for example, 'What is humanity? What is human nature?' We would often talk about how people, looked at individually, are good. There are so many wonderful people out there. But when they become a group, or a nation, or even just big groups, at that level, something happens. It's like a different switch gets flipped. And what you see there, that is what we're trying to depict in Humanity.\"\nWatch above or over on Game Informer's YouTube channel to see the full documentary about the making of Humanity. \"Violence Is Inevitable\" speaks to the core creative team, including Mizuguchi and tha creative director Yugo Nakamura, about the project's origins, its complications and lengthy development cycle, and how it came to show us the nature of humanity.",

Its Season 1 premiere was HBO's second-largest debut since 2010, and its second episode broke records, too. Roughly three weeks after the premiere of the series, HBO revealed The Last of Us would be getting a second season. And now, thanks to a new Deadline report, we know it will start shooting next year and premiere sometime in 2025. \nDeadline learned this at a New York news event, where HBO boss Casey Bloys reportedly told press that Season 2 will head into production early next year, aiming for a 2025 premiere. Unfortunately, that's all Bloys said about the season. But, as noted by Deadline, series co-creator and executive producer Craig Mazin revealed earlier this summer pre-strike that the team was already able to get some work done, adding that the first episode was already written. \n\n\n\"We got pretty far actually, we were doing great,\" Mazin told Deadline. \"[The Last of Us game co-creator Neil Druckmann] and I had been sitting and talking with [The Last of Us Part II co-writer Halley Gross] and Bo Shim, the new writer that was in our little tiny room with us – obviously not a mini room because we're greenlit proper, we're a real show, and because I hate that mini room stuff.\"\nConsidering the first season of The Last of Us covered the events of the first Last of Us game, including its Left Behind DLC, it's clear Season 2 of the show will dive into The Last of Us Part II. We're all still awaiting some casting announcements, like who will play Abby and Lev, but that likely won't happen until the actor and writer strikes are over. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's The Last of Us Part 1 review and then read our review of The Last of Us Part II. \n[Source: Deadline]\nHow far into The Last of Us Part II do you think Season 2 will go?

Link, Samus, and even Donkey Kong (sort of) all had inexplicable cameos in the game, and one of my big questions about the remake was whether or not those would move forward. If you're ready to learn the answer for at least some of them, read on!\nImpressively, the answer is yes! At least for Link and Donkey Kong. I have not been able to play to the point in the game where Samus appears, so I can't answer that question yet. When you get close to Link after seeing him in the sleeping bed, a \"talk\" option appears, and when you click it, a Zelda musical sting plays.\nDonkey Kong's cameo has always been questionable as to whether or not it is him, as he is just labeled \"Guerilla\", but he sure looks a lot like Donkey Kong, just with a crown.\n\nThe Super Mario RPG remake releases November 17 for Nintendo Switch.\nPurchase",

Ahead of his debut, NetherRealm Studios has released the official Omni-Man gameplay trailer and alongside hard-hitting (and gory) super moves, it features a brutal and show-accurate fatality for the character. \nThe trailer teases Liu Kang for allowing a Viltrumite into the Realms of Mortal Kombat before more than two minutes of Omni-Man action plays out. And closing out the trailer is the fatality for the upcoming Kombat Pack character. We won't spoil it here, so check it out in the Mortal Kombat 1 Omni-Man gameplay trailer below: \n\n\nOmni-Man hits Mortal Kombat 1 as part of the first Kombat Pack on November 9. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Mortal Kombat 1 review and then check out Mortal Kombat creator Ed Boon on Hot Ones. \nAre you excited for Omni-Man in Mortal Kombat 1?

However, a series of strange accidents, plus some murmurings of a ghost haunting, quickly threaten to turn this renovation into an investigation.\nIn Nancy Drew: Treasure in the Royal Tower a failed ski vacation at an eccentric castle with even more eccentric inhabitants soon turns into a quest to uncover a lost piece of the history of the French Revolution.\nAnd if you’re looking for something more thrilling, in Nancy Drew: The Final Scene, you will find yourself racing against the clock to find your kidnapped friend, while also saving a historical theater with more than a fair share of secrets from demolition.\nThe games are available for purchase through HeR Interactive’s website or Steam (Stay Tuned for Danger is not available on Steam, however). Or if you already own a CD copy of the games, their English and Russian variants will also work. To play them with ScummVM, you will need a daily development build. As always, if you encounter any issues, please submit a bug report to our issue tracker.\n>",

          "description": "We are very pleased to announce today the start of the testing period of two single-game engines: Kingdom: The Far Reaches and Escape From Hell!\nKingdom, was developed and released by Interplay in 1995. Only the DOS version of the game (available on gog.com) is supported. It's a cartoon FMV game, with an inventory, in which you have to guide Lathan Kandor through a medieval world, discovering the magic spells and the items required to defeat an evil wizard. \nEscape From Hell, was developed for Electronic Arts by the game veterans Richard Seaborne and Alan Murphy and was released in 1990. You play Alan in this keyboard-only Role Playing Game and visit Hell, looking for your girlfriend who was accidentally teleported there.\nBoth games use heavily hardcoded logic which is error prone and requires a lot of testing, so we need your feedback more than ever as they are both incompletely tested. There is sadly only one known demo for Kingdom. Support for the Windows and Mac versions of Kingdom may come later! Please contact us if you have some other demos of both games.\nTo play any of these games, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker and please take some screenshots along the way!\n>",
