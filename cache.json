As such, they based it on the syntax of English, meaning the order of words would closely follow that of the English language. This allowed Hughes to recognise where certain words were placed when compared to his native language, thus allowing him to convey subtleties and nuance when recording his lines.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "One of my absolute most favouritest Steam Deck cases, besides the one you get for free with the Steam Deck OLED, is the Dbrand Project Killswitch. It’s not so much a carrying vessel as a hardened second skin, providing protection without all the bag-hogging bulk of a traditional case – while throwing in handy bonuses like a clip-on kickstand and grippy thumbstick covers. For owners of the Asus ROG Ally, the recent launch of a Project Killswitch for their own handheld PC should therefore represent glad tidings with extra gladness, even if it won’t also fit the upcoming ROG Ally X.\nThank the new device’s bigger battery, wider SSD and reworked connection layout for that particular lack of forwards compatibility, as the ROG Ally X’s thicker dimensions will make it just slightly too beefy to slip into the Killswitch’s skintight silicone. A shame, but at least it makes a quality addition to the original Ally right this second. I’ve been manhandling one for a week now, and it’s just as practical and protective as the Steam Deck version.\nRead more",

          "description": "Computer Artworks' 2002 videogame adaptation of 1982 movie The Thing was a ghoulish and gripping third-person shooter with some terrific mechanics that weren't quite fleshed out, flesh being the operative word. For instance: you can enlist surviving soldiers as squadmates, but are they really surviving soldiers, or are they human-shaped warrens of teeth and mandibles poised to split open and shower you in digestive juices? You have a limited supply of blood tests with which to determine whether any people you rescue are Things in waiting - and even as you're worrying about them, they're casting suspicious eyes at you, care of some embryonic \"trust\" and \"fear\" systems.\nSadly, much of this acute paranoia could be easily gamed out in practice - back in 2002, I deduced that contact with enemies increased the odds of infection, and adopted a policy of shooting anyone who'd been in my squad for too long. But it's the kind of system an intelligent remake could pounce upon and have fun with. Sadly, Nightdive are not working on a remake, like their previous System Shock remakes. They've just announced that they're making a remaster, due later this year. Still, I will take a Thing remaster and thus, the opportunity to write more about The Thing, over no remaster at all.\n Read more",

This is coming on top of the already-announced Hyper Light Breaker. Please, Heart Machine, pace yourselves. I barely have time to play the daily crossword.\nRead more",

They are very obviously non-spectral, going by the amount of stabbing and clanging on show in the video.

Inasmuch as can be told in the absence of dialogue or a text preamble, the naked man wants to murder you because you, and not he, are in possession of a hat. The hat makes you look like an eraser pencil from Forbidden Planet. It's the kind of headgear worn by the kind of criminal Batman's too grown-up to fight anymore. But it has, nonetheless, roused in this under-dressed stranger a sense of Dionysian frenzy. He will do anything for that hat - hewing your arms off, ripping your intestines out, tearing the skin from your ribcage. And you, in turn, will do anything to rob him of that mattock, because by the gods, it looks a lot more dangerous than the candlestick you're trying to fend him off with.\r\n\n\r\nThere are many such lost souls in the bleak, midnight world of the Half Sword demo - all lurking near candle-lit piles of randomly spawned hammers, stools, barrels, axes and lengths of wood, all subject to unforgivably authentic physics and cursor-based attacks that conspire to transform every scuffle into a Monty Python blooper reel.\r\n\n \nRead more",

If, like this week for some reason, I feel like bursting into tears at inopportune moments, I need silly little guys doing whimsical activities. Enter Dungeon Clawler. It’s a vaguely Slay The Spire-ish roguelite where you grab weapons from a claw machine while you fight. It's got lazy Steam Deck depression nap written all over it. The main theme reminds me of Zombies Ate My Neighbors, and the character I picked is named Sir Bunalot.\n \nRead more",

Whereas CES splits its focus across tech, cars, and the occasional overdesigned white good, Computex is all computing, all the time, making it a prime source of reveals and showcases for the hardware bits that make games happen.\nSadly, Computex 2024 is unlikely to go down as a classic, largely because this year’s show has been mesmerised by AI and the most tedious applications thereof: search, but different somehow! Run art-stealing generation tools faster! Oh, Computex, what have they done to you, and why do you have seven fingers on one hand?\nGranted, AI is a broad field, and not everything about it is necessarily gross or creatively bankrupting. But it also doesn’t deserve to overshadow all the other useful, unexpected, and curiosity-piquing gaming tech that Computex has to offer, from new Steam Deck alternatives to resurrected CPU lineups and promising graphics card updates. Here are those highlights of the show so far...\nRead more",

Sorry, did I say ‘worthwhile art’? I meant to say “lots of money.” Let’s get clicking!\nFirst up, I need to name my studio (I settle on Horace's Revenge) as well as my crack new team of business bastards. There’s my chief legal officer, Jebediah End. My CCO, Anne Egg, and CFO, Rummy McLastdrink. He doesn’t have a sauce problem, because obviously I wouldn’t put him in charge of money if he did. In the wreckage of the studio, we find an unedited film reel hidden in the waffles n’ cocaine cupboard. It’s a noir thriller named ‘Messenger Of Death’. Whatever influential critic is currently directing this era’s discourse has chosen to categorise each film as genre percentages (‘60% detective/40% thriller’), and setting (‘modern American city’.)

          "description": "I was a diehard WipeOut player as a kid. Seriously, me and the boys used to roam the streets of Bradford looking for F-Zero players to bully, at least till the RollCagers rocked up and stole our lunch money. Mind you, I think I was probably less interested in WipeoUt's racing than its trackside landscapes, which remain exquisite decades on - all those sweeping album-cover facades with their animate fixtures that thickened and solidified into full-blown peripheral cities as the series progressed. \r\n\n\r\nI am similarly hooked by the worlds of Ghosts Ehf's Phantom Spark, which are a million lightyears from WiPeout in terms of their influences and atmosphere, much as the underlying hover-jockeying is a million lightyears away from WipeouT in terms of its gentleness and lack of combative elements. But these spaces are just as mesmerising to fly through and think about when not focussed on finding the perfect line through the next corner, or avoiding a patch of grass. Small wonder, given that the game's art director is Joost Eggermont, whose streaking astral contraptions and \"small interactive moments\" I've long admired, but never managed to write about until now.\r\n \nRead more",

He'll report on the results, which are often tremendous. Look at the LIFE in that jar! The little wriggly lads just wriggling around. The blobs whose job is to float and squidge indiscriminately.

Grunn’s shear sound wormed its way past my eyes and into parts of my brain I’d previously assumed could only be accessed by either masterful ASMR or irresponsibly long Q-tips. I used to have anxiety, but now, my only fear in life is that Grunn’s grass will run out, so I no longer have a reason to click away with its shears. Play Grunn, innit.

The hardest track ever created in Trackmania was published by a team of mappers on May 4th, bringing an intimidating 16-floor tower called Deep Dip 2 into the racing game. It became a magnet for competitive drivers after a prize pool of over $30,000 was offered to the first three players to conquer its hellish heights. The prize has yet to be claimed. Even today, determined racers continue to bang their heads against the brutally designed course, featuring icy surfaces, curving rails, and perilous loop-the-loops that hang kilometres about the ground. Some players have parked their hopes and given up. But others persevere. The top three players have reached the final floor and currently stand shoulder to shoulder, eyes focused on the prize.\r\n\r\n \nRead more",

In addition to going up to 16 cores versus 8 with the Xeon E-2400 series, the more competitive pricing, the 3D V-Cache SKUs, and 28 PCIe lanes rather than 20, the AMD EPYC 4004 models also support DDR5-5200 memory where as the Intel Raptor Lake E-2400 models are bound to DDR5-4800. In this follow-up testing is a look at the AMD EPYC 4004 performance both at DDR5-4800 and DDR5-5200 speeds for showing the performance difference.",

          "description": "During the Ubisoft Forward Stream, the company has again assured us that their remake of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time still exists. Except it’s coming in 2026. They told us this during an extremely brief nothing of a teaser.\n\n\nConsidering this is the series’ 35th anniversary and they’re making a big deal of it, they probably wanted the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake to hit this year, but things don’t sound like they’re going that well with a change of developers back in 2022. I suppose with nothing else to tell us, they showed us a candle burning in reverse before revealing a pretty far-off date. That’s far enough away for me to forget that it exists.\n\n\n\n\nPrince of Persia: The Sands of Time first came out in 2003 and brought new excitement to the franchise started by Jordan Mechner back in 1989. Since then, new entries in the series have been pretty frequent, but arguably, none have really been able to achieve the same popularity.\n\n\nThat’s not for lack of trying. This year saw Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown which released to critical acclaim. The Rogue Prince of Persia is currently in early access and is being handled by the devs of one of the best Roguelite platformers, Dead Cells. Even without the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake, it’s a pretty great year for the series.\n\n\nPrince of Persia: The Sands of Time will be coming in 2026.\n\nThe post Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time coming in 2026, new teaser could have been an email appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Ubisoft Forward has officially confirmed the new content for XDefiant's Season 1. And fortunately, the wait won't be too long with its expected July 2, 2024 release. \n\n\nThe trailer revealed various content, including the highly anticipated new Faction, GSK. What the latest group will entail is still a mystery, but I can't wait to try it out to see what other unique tactics will be available. In addition to a Faction expansion, we also got a look at three free Eruption weapon skins. These shiny, new gems will undoubtedly spice up your weaponry, but you'll need to play the game in the next 48 hours to get them. \n\n\n\n\nNew maps are expected to arrive per month, and we have already gotten the inside scoop into three of them. Specifically, XDefiant will offer Clubhouse, Daytona, and Rockefeller. If you're a racing fan, you'll undoubtedly know all about Daytona. The other maps will also bring about plenty of shenanigans, especially if they are on a much smaller scale in terms of size. \n\n\nMaps aren't the only thing to look forward to with the upcoming release of the new game mode, Capture the Flag. Every shooter game veteran will certainly enjoy this one, including the new ranked progression rewards that are expected to come for Season 1. \n\n\nBe sure to tune into XDefiant Season 1 on July 2, 2024, and get your hands on the Eruption weapon skins while they're hot. \n\nThe post XDefiant Season 1 roadmap includes new Faction, Eruption skins, and more appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Depending on where you live and how active you are in the community, you may already be familiar with Monopoly GO’s Tycoon Racers minigame, as it was introduced to the game months ago in a few select regions. However, with a recent social media post from Scopely, it seems we’ll all experience some racing action for the first time in a future update. If we’re lucky, we may even get the chance to play it this week.\n\n\nAlthough the original posts in the official Monopoly GO Discord and Facebook page don’t reveal too much information about the event or its release date, we have several major clues suggesting this is the introduction of Tycoon Racers. The main two clues of a covered-up car and the “ready to RACE” line are clear indicators, but we have one more to go off.  \n\n\nImage via Monopoly GO Discord / Screenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe third clue is the official Scopely help page, which updated its article on Tycoon Racers a day ago, adding details on the event. It gives a complete summary of the race, including its being another collaborative event similar to Partners Events and how to collect flags for points.\n\n\nThe opening line also introduces it as Monopoly GO’s latest minigame, suggesting it’ll be released before another Treasures, Partners, or Peg-E Prize Drop event returns. Considering the next Partners event is due to appear soon, there are high odds of Tycoon Racers being the one to appear instead.\n\n\nAs of now, there’s no public release date for when this mysterious event or Tycoon Racers will launch. However, considering the Martian Treasures event is ending soon, it can even go live tomorrow, June 11, for the first time in all regions. Only time will tell, though.\n\nThe post Monopoly GO’s long-awaited Tycoon Racers event may be coming sooner than you think appeared first on Destructoid.",

Bethesda has finally released its in-game Creations platform alongside the Shattered Space DLC showcase, and the Creation Kit is available as well.\n\n\nWhat this means, in effect, is that Starfield is now a full-featured sandbox modding platform in much the same way as Skyrim and Fallout 4 are. Dedicated modders now have access to a far more substantial range of tools and features allowing them to work on substantially more complicated mods. The fact that we've already had a major Starfield revamp mod months ago should help illustrate what sort of stuff is now on the horizon, I feel. But, of course, that's just the start of it.\n\n…",

The story-driven adventure is aiming for a specific type of challenge, and a demo is now live ahead of a planned Q2 2025 launch.\n\n\nThe start of Bittersweet Birthday — which has World Eater Games developing and DANGEN Entertainment publishing — finds you waking up without any memories. As you attempt to flee the dangers lurking in this mysterious location, a voice comes through the speaker system and offers a means of escape. From there, you'll have to pick up the pieces of your past and venture forth through the challenges that await.\n\n\nYou can get an idea of how the story unfolds and see some of the promised multi-phase boss battles in the announcement trailer below.\n\n\n\n\nThe team at World Eater Games first launched an Indiegogo campaign for Bittersweet Birthday back in August 2021. 341 backers pushed it past its $23,000 goal to make development a possibility, and now you can try it for yourself in a demo that's live on Steam. \n\n\nBeyond the enigmatic narrative and intense battles, Bittersweet Birthday has a few ways for players to stretch out and relax in its world. There are mini games like darts and gachapon, the latter of which has 48 collectibles to pick up while playing. There are also side quests that give you a chance to hunt down secrets and unlock more Memories.  \n\n\nThe team cites a handful of inspirations, including The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, Undertale, Hyper Light Drifter, OneShot, and the Monster Hunter series. When Bittersweet Birthday launches next year, it will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.\n\nThe post Action-RPG Bittersweet Birthday previews bullet hell battles ahead of 2025 launch appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "While some resources in Warframe can be difficult to acquire and utilize a very specific farming method, other resources are easy to come by. In trade, you need a lot of them to be able to craft what you want. One such resource shows up quite commonly but is used in many different recipes. Here's how to get Fish Oil in Warframe.\n\n\nWhere to farm Fish Oil in Warframe\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nFish Oil is acquired by catching any fish from the Plains of Eidolon and skinning it. These fish can be skinned at Fisher Hai-Luk for free through the Cut Fish dialogue option, and you can cut as many fish as you can catch. Alongside Fish Oil, you'll get several other resources for other recipes such as Amps, Zaws, frame components, and more.\n\n\nThe amount of Fish Oil you'll get from a fish will depend on the fish you catch and its size. For example, a small Sharrac will grant two Fish Oil, while a large Sharrac will grant four. With this inconsistency in mind, the best fish for Fish Oil is the Murkray, rewarding seven, eight, and nine Fish Oil for small, medium, and large respectively. Murkray can be acquired from Ocean hotspots, through which you must use Murkray Bait also purchased from Fisher Hai-Luk. While looking for Murkray, be sure to catch any other fish you see so you can get their Fish Oil as well.\n\n\nWhat is Fish Oil used for?\n\n\nFish Oil is primarily used in Grips and Braces for both Zaws and Amps respectively. Alongside them, you'll need some for Twilight Bait, Grendel's Systems, and the Archwing Launcher segment. If you want to build one of everything, you'll need a total of 660 Fish Oil. For every bit of Twilight Bait you craft, add 10 to that counter.\n\nThe post How to get Fish Oil in Warframe appeared first on Destructoid.",

With said impression in mind, you're also probably wondering if she'll end up being a playable character, so I've got some insight about that will probably make you happy.\n\n\nWill Camellya be playable in Wuthering Waves?\n\n\nI've played several Gacha games over the years, and one thing that has always been a commonality is the determination of which characters show up as playable. That commonality is that important characters that interact with the PC (Player Character) tend to become playable. As I said, this is common in most gacha games, and I believe that Camellya's unique situation with the PC in Wuthering …",

          "description": "If you’re a fan of Bleach and are playing Type Souls in Roblox, you may be wondering if and when you’ll reach Rukongai, the largest, most populated area of Soul Society. Good news; you can. This is how you get to the Rukon District.\n\n\nThe most important requirement for getting into the Rukon District is that you have to become a Soul Reaper. Don’t worry; we have a guide to help you out with that. If you’re already progressing through another class (Hollow or Quincy), you can use a Soul Ticket to reroll your character.\n\n\nGetting to Rukon District is a part of becoming a Soul Reaper. To start this off, you first have to die. I’m not sure I have to explain this, but you can either let yourself be killed by a Hollow or get “help” from another player.\n\n\nOnce you die, you’ll become a Lost Soul and be taken to Karakura Town. There, you’ll want to find Kisuke (a guy sitting on a bench wearing a striped hat roughly in the middle of town). Tell him you want to become a Soul Reaper, and he’ll set you off as a Shinigami. Directly after that conversation, you’ll be taken to the Rukon District.\n\n\nThere you have it. You’ve made it to Rukongai. From here, as a Shinigami, you can join a division and start tackling their missions. It’s your first step into actually playing Type Souls as a Soul Reaper.\n\nThe post How to get to the Rukon District in Type Soul appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Despite being a huge success, Oblivion has no doubt been overshadowed both by time and its loftier successor, Skyrim. Still, The Elder Scrolls 4 exists as a major player in the RPG genre, but that hasn't stopped someone from wanting to blend the two games together. Sort of.\n\n\nThe \"Skyrim Border\" mod comes from the mind of Nexus Mods user JoopvanDie, and is essentially a way of bringing a bit of TES5 to Cyrdoiil, the province where Oblivion takes place. Anyone who knows the map of Tamriel is aware that the latter game borders the former, though players are unable to cross.\n\n\nImage via JoopvanDie/Nexus Mods.\n\n\nHowever, JoopvanDie invites us to step a little bit into Skyrim, giving us a small area to trek around in, perhaps breathe in a bit of that cold, dragon-y air.\n\n\nJust a quick pop by to say hello\n\n\nAs the name suggests, the mod by no means allows you to traverse the whole of Skyrim's landscape or cross over into any other part of Tamriel that's not officially part of the game. That would be far too ambitious. And, in fact, there is already a fan-made project that covers that idea.\n\n\nWhat this does is bring just a little bit of the border within our grasp inside Oblivion. While there's not a huge amount there – no new quests, for example – there's enough that's worth a quick visit. This includes:\n\n\n\nan area for you to explore\n\n\none small village with NPCs\n\n\nfew small caves\n\n\ntwo ingredients\n\n\none new creature (Frost troll)\n\n\nnew armor and a medieval Scandinavian(ish) helmet\n\n\ntreasure hunting\n\n\n\nIf you want to get to the area, the description says to go to the Echo Cave (shown just west of Bruma, which you can see in the image above) and follow the road to the northwest. Say hi to Paarthurnax for me if he's there.\n\nThe post This Oblivion mod lets you explore Skyrim, but only a tiny bit appeared first on Destructoid.",

With GSC Game World having to flee to Prague to escape the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the future of the long-awaited horror FPS remained uncertain at one point.\n\n\nWe know it had to be delayed for fairly obvious reasons, pushing the release date back to September 5. Now, the latest trailer has been released, and it's really whetting my appetite for Heart of Chornobyl.\n\n\n\n\nThe gloomy backdrop of the Exclusion Zone has never looked prettier than in the \"Time of Opportunities\" teaser the developer put out yesterday. While many of us strongly suspect Stalker 2 is going to be quite something, I now cannot wait for it to finally arrive.\n\n\nHeart and soul\n\n\nThat's not to say I was ignorant of the game until now. Though I admit, I haven't really played any of the other entries in the series, aside from a brief stint of the first game. But that doesn't mean it hasn't intrigued me, largely because it's been fifteen years since GSC released the last installment, Call of Pripyat.\n\n\nAt any rate, the new trailer really shows off what's almost certainly going to be a pretty solid horror FPS. I know I'm not alone in saying that it gives me mad Chernobylite vibes, which I have played and did enjoy.\n\n\nIt has, indeed, been a long and worrisome road for the development team, but whatever tribulations have come their way, they've remained steadfast in their completion of Stalker 2. I truly hope it pays off for them, because it looks fantastic.

Assassin's Creed Shadows is the answer to that oft-repeated request, but it's far more than that, thanks to the introduction of a second protagonist, Yasuke the samurai. He's a playable historical figure (a first for the series) and his approach varies wildly from the shinobi protagonist, Naoe. We got a first-hand look at this during a behind-closed-doors demo in Los Angeles.\n\n\nIt opens with Yasuke entering a town, drawing everyone's attention. As if his ornate armor wasn't enough to set him apart, Yasuke is a huge person, and people in the street stare as he walks by. The developers ex…",

The open-world scoundrel game shows protagonist Kay Vess, a thief looking to start a new life, trying to hunt down a gunslinger to learn her talents. This takes her from a space station marketplace to Tatooine's iconic Mos Eisley. \nThe 10-minute guided walkthrough focuses on one aspect of Outlaws, which is tracking down elusive experts in order to learn their craft. From being the fastest draw in the galaxy to mastering sleight of hand, these skills will help Kay go from a common (though wanted) thief to a legendary outlaw. The video shows off the seamless ground-to-ship gameplay, one of the optional space dogfights you can engage in, speeder bike gameplay across the sands of Tatooine, as well as stealth and shootout sequences. \n\n\nIf you'd like a more condensed summary of what Star Wars Outlaws entails, another trailer serves as a shorter tour through some of the planets players will visit, the characters they'll meet, the systems at play, and a glimpse into some story moments. \n\n\nYou can learn more about Star Wars Outlaws by visiting our cover story hub.",

It was followed up with Dragon Age II in 2011, and then Dragon Age: Inquisition in 2014. While the Dragon Age series' history has its ups and downs, fans have been patiently waiting for BioWare to return to the franchise, and 2024 is finally the year. \nWe visited BioWare's Edmonton, Canada, office for an exclusive look at Dragon Age: The Veilguard, including a look at its character creator, its prologue and opening missions, and more.

As part of that, we learned the series is implementing a new movement system, bringing back round-based Zombies and Classic Prestige, and taking us to the year 1991 for its campaign. We also learned another key piece of information: when we'll be able to play it.\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 6 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 25. Alongside that, players can expect a campaign that hopes to instill a sense of paranoia and intrigue with the Black Ops team going rogue in order to remove an entity that has infiltrated the highest levels of government, as well as a competitive multiplayer suite that includes 16 all-new maps.

The footage thankfully didn't spoil any major story beats for the Metal Gear Solid 3 newcomers, but we saw lots of sneaking, eating, and CQC.\n\n\nOther details, like whether series creator Hideo Kojima is involved in any way (unlikely) and a release date, are still unknown. But we're still excited to commence the virtuous mission again, hopefully soon.",

State of Decay 3 doesn’t have a release date yet, but we do know that the game will release on Game Pass on day one.\nThe earlier State of Decay games focused on survival first, rather than simply gunning down hordes of enemies that have infested the world, even if taking out zombies remained a notable part of the experience. Beginning with the second game, there was also a big focus on cooperative play for up to four players. Based on the new trailer, that second feature appears to be a particular focus, as the narrative of the video showcases individuals working together to survive the killer undead all around them.",

And, as the name suggests, it brings Doomguy to a more medieval setting. Revealed during today's Xbox Games Showcase, The Dark Ages sees the infamous demon defeater shoot and blast his way through a world seemingly inspired by medieval scenery. It will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (and Xbox and PC Game Pass) sometime next year. \nFret not, though. It's still very much Doom, with plenty of weapons, demons from hell, some fantastic metal music, and a ton of gory first-person shooter action. \nCheck it out for yourself in the Doom: The Dark Ages reveal trailer below: \n\n\nAs you can see from the trailer above, Doom: The Dark Ages is a visual departure from the rest of the series. The scenery, weaponry, and even the enemies look significantly more medieval than anything else seen in the Doom series. There even appears to be a rideable dragon, too. \nId Software rebooted the series back in 2016 with Doom, which we loved – read why in Game Informer's Doom review. The studio followed it up with Doom Eternal in 2019, which we enjoyed even more. Read Game Informer's Doom Eternal review to find out why we gave it a 9.25 out of 10. \nInterestingly, this is the first Doom game from Id Software and publisher Bethesda Softworks since Microsoft (and Xbox) acquired Bethesda parent company ZeniMax Media in 2020 for $7.5 billion. Many have speculated how Xbox will handle exclusivity with its recent years of acquisitions, including whether future Doom, Call of Duty, and other popular IPs now under the Xbox umbrella will get multiplatform releases. It seems, in Doom's case at least, it will still come to PlayStation, which makes sense, considering Doom and Doom Eternal were released there as well. \nWhat do you think of Doom: The Dark Ages' reveal?

In the reveal trailer below, you can see one of those protagonists, Hanna, an adolescent orphan searching for her brother Herman. That journey transforms Hanna into a reluctant hero, inspiring herself and her friends to rise from the gutters of Eriksholm to become symbols of change. \nCheck it out for yourself in the Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream reveal trailer below: \n\n\nFrom Eriksholm's top-down 3D perspective, players will control the game's three protagonists to navigate through the city (aboveground and underground) while utilizing unique character skills, tools, weapons, and more to overcome enemies and complete puzzles. River End Games says players can freely move the in-game camera to survey the environment, plan their next steps, and execute strategies with perfect timing. \n\"All of us at River End Games are proud to finally reveal Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream to the world,\" studio founder and creative director Anders Hejdenberg writes in a press release. \"This is just the first glimpse of what we've done, and we hope it will capture your hearts and minds, just like it has captured ours.

          "description": "Heart Machine, the team behind Hyper Light Drifter and Solar Ash, has revealed Possessor(s), a side-scrolling action game coming to consoles and PC next year. Revealed during today's Devolver Digital presentation and teased earlier this week, Possessor(s) features action combat inspired by platform fighters like Super Smash Bros. set in a quarantined city destroyed by interdimensional catastrophe. \nIn Possessor(s), you control Luca, the host, and Rehm, her less-than-cooperative counterpart as the two venture through a sprawling metropolis filled with collapsed skyscrapers to explore and secrets to uncover. Devolver says the narrative features multiple paths in an \"open-ended world structure\" as players attempt to learn the truth behind the catastrophe that has wrecked the city (and seemingly the world). \n\n\n\"Gameplay is centered around tight, fast-paced platforming with a range of unique movement abilities that extends to its tense, precise combat,\" a press release for Possessor(s) reads. \"Balance ground and air attacks, replete with combos and juggles as you encounter a variety of deadly enemies and challenging bosses.\"\nThroughout Possessor(s), players will discover upgrades that allow Luca and Rehm to explore previously inaccessible areas, nodding toward a potential Metroidvania-style city layout. \nHere are some Possessor(s) screenshots: \n\nPossessor(s) hits consoles and PC in 2025, presumably after Heart Machine's other in-development game, Hyper Light Breaker, hits PC this year. \nWhat do you think of this Possessor(s) reveal?

Revealed during today's Devolver Digital presentation, Tenjutsu is a fully fleshed-out version of Tenjutsu (48h version), which Deepnight released back in 2022.\nDevolver describes the game as a \"fast and fluid rogue-jutsu,\" leaning into the game's jujutsu roguelite action. In it, you control a renegade yakuza \"hellbent on defying her former associates and loosening their grip on the Secret Garden City.\" To do so, you must fight four powerful crime syndicates. To defeat them \"you must master a brutal brawling system and build a diverse arsenal of weapons, upgrades, and martial arts techniques, breaking their hold on the streets in a flurry of violence.\" \nCheck out the Tenjutsu trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nWhile you must take down all four crime syndicates, the order you do so is up to you. As you take more and more down, you gain control of Secret Garden City and can seemingly upgrade its districts and more for rewards. Doing so will unlock new weapons, combat moves, and additional areas for exploration. However, the longer you spend doing this, the stronger your enemies become. \nHere are some Tenjutsu screenshots: \nThere is no release date for Tenjutsu just yet, but it's coming to undisclosed consoles and PC. \nWhat do you think of Tenjutsu's reveal?
