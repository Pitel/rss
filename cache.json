Fear not, the studio's flair for an intriguing setup remains with its latest release inspired heavily by Russian folklore, leaving the question of whether or not Little Orpheus is any fun to play.\nLittle Orpheus begins with protagonist Ivan Ivanovich Privalov being interrogated by a man known as the General. You see, Ivan is a bumbling Soviet Cosmonaut who – having failed his exams and his physical – is sent on a massive drill to the centre of the Earth rather than the stars. Ivan went missing for three years, and now the General wants to know the whereabouts of the titular atomic bomb that helped power the drill. Ivan weaves an incredible story to stave off his execution at the hands of his increasingly irate interrogator.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "A monolithic tale.\nMonolith Soft has become one of the most recognisable of Nintendo's first-party developers in recent times. Led by legendary RPG writer and director Tetsuya Takahashi, the studio is renowned for the monolithic (pun intended) Xenoblade series. Combining MMORPG-style, memorable worlds, stunning music, and philosophical writing, the Xenoblade Chronicles franchise has taken the world by storm. Monolith Soft's history, however, is as monolithic as its now-flagship series.\nTakahashi is perhaps most famous for co-writing and directing the seminal PS1 RPG Xenogears, which he created during his time at Squaresoft. But in the years following Xenogears' 1998 release, Square decided to focus all of its energy on the Final Fantasy series. Xenogears underperformed in the eyes of the company, but Takahashi had big plans for his proposed franchise, of which Xenogears was meant to be 'Episode 5'.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It's an imaginative and very pleasant 3D platformer that challenges you to think outside the box and find a new purpose in everyday objects — especially since they'll be the only thing to help you escape the '90s house you've found yourself in. But it's okay, you're not alone; Tinykin is filled to the brim with intriguing NPCs to guide the way.\nYou take on the role of Milodane, an explorer and astronaut who finds himself in a cluttered house on planet Earth, but this house has an unusual atmosphere, and there are no humans. Instead, each room is infested with an array of talkative insects who quickly request Milo's help for the rewards of something we see as a mundane household object, but to Milo, they are the key to repairing his ship and finally heading home.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Sony have been regularly releasing games on PC for a while now, with an often quick turnaround between 'announcement' and 'it's out now'. The exception is the Uncharted: Legacy Of Thieves Collection, which was confirmed for PC back in September 2021 but which still hasn't arrived.\r\n\nIt seems like that will change soon. A recent, hastily-removed update to the collection's Epic Games Store page declared that it would release on October 19th.\r\n\n \nRead more",

This milestone has made me realise that the Creedsperience has taken up almost half of my current lifespan.

It includes new DLC for Valhalla, and a mysterious horror-ish tease. But top of the list, after next year's more trad and compact Assassin's Creed Mirage, is Assassin's Creed: Codename Red, the next big flagship open-world RPG for the series.

The other part, though, is often entirely selfish on our part, just playing and writing about cool games we like. In fact, the decision to review many of the games we covered this week - Railbound, Jack Move and Roadwarden - were all down to having played and liked some form of demo, making events like the Steam Next Fest an increasingly invaluable tool in helping us cut through the noise when we inevitably enter mega months like September. \nRead more",

Every year in games there's a fat month, where loads of games come out and loads of them look really good and there is never enough time godammit.\nThis year that month is September. There are so many games out this month that look so much my jam that I want to spread 'em on my morning toast, but September is also the month that a lot of RPS staff have holiday booked - including me, for two weeks, which means that if these games do get reviewed it probably won't be by me.

In the game, it's the year everything went dark in this turn-based Japanese-style RPG, with a solar storm biffing the world's electronics. It threw the world into chaos, giving rise to the megacorps that now control the dystopian cyberpunk society where our heroine Noa is trying to make a living. In the real world, of course, 1997 was the year Final Fantasy VII came out, the seminal JRPG that Jack Move owes a great deal to (right down to its menu plink plink sound). Developers So Romantic have said outright that it's been one of the main inspirations for Jack Move, and its shady corporate powers and grungy urban landscape certainly feel of a piece with ShinRa's grip on the city of Midgar. \nBut the bigwigs at MonoMind aren't out to poison the world and suck the life from it in Jack Move. Instead, they're more concerned with using their newfound technological powers to find eternal life – a classic 'upload your mind to the metaverse' kind of tale you'll probably recognise if you've read any of the cyberpunk 101 novels such as William Gibson's Neuromancer or Permutation City by Greg Egan. Jack Move's story doesn't tread any new ground in this respect, but Noa and her hacker pal Ryder are a fiery spirited pair that make this six-hour tale of espionage and rebellion against its cartoonish villain well worth dipping into. Yes, you read that correctly. A JRPG you can polish off in a single day of play. Bliss.\nRead more",

          "description": "I keep thinking about Roadwarden like a tourist city that I visited for not quite long enough. Sure, I saw the main sights and had a great time soaking in the ambiance, but I know that I missed so many hidden gems. I want to go back and explore, maybe this time with a local guide who knows its secrets.\nAt its most basic, Roadwarden is a text-based RPG. You play as the titular roadwarden, who sets out from the city to investigate an unmapped peninsula with little more than their horse for company. Your goal as set by the people who sent you is to investigate the region and report your findings in preparation for the expansion of trade guilds in the area. But you can also set your own goal, shaping your character’s approach from the start in a way that helps with roleplaying a particular kind of adventurer throughout. And once you get to that adventuring, dozens of sidequests open up covering everything from gathering fruit to curing the plague.\nRead more",

They'd escaped the clutches of the French Inquisition and the hordes of plague rats following in their wake, and the pair were hopeful about finding a cure for the cursed macula flowing through Hugo's veins.\nAlas, when I pick up their journey in chapter six of Asobo's upcoming sequel, A Plague Tale: Requiem, Amicia is having a particularly terrible time of it. Not only is she suffering from an open head wound, leaving her unsteady on her feet, but rumours are flying in the nearby pilgrim camp about something bad having gone down in the last city they passed through. Exactly what is hard to say with five chapters' worth of context missing from my preview build, but the pack of guards who are hot on the siblings' trail quickly make it plain: several men died back in that city, and they're pointing the finger squarely at Amicia's knife, slingshot and crossbow. \nRead more",

I mean, there’s only four of them, and you’re forced to constantly perform tricks to regain ammo, which doesn't make them easy to use. I think it’s because of their more literal significance in the game. Rollerdrome threatens you with multiple enemy types called Houseplayers, all formidable, especially in the heat of battle when they combine their efforts. Luckily, the four distinct weapons you’re equipped with act as an equaliser; each weapon is a solution for a particular enemy. Developers Roll7 could have easily added a bunch of copied and pasted guns from every generic shooter, but instead they were more intentional about the weapons they included, with each weapon complimenting the gunplay and the game as a whole.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The AMD Ryzen 5 5600 is a cheaper, better-value version of the Ryzen 5600X - the CPU took the world by storm when Ryzen 5000 launched back in 2020. With six cores and 12 threads to access, you get good performance in modern game engines, while the higher single-core speeds introduced with this generation of AMD processors allows for better performance in single-core-limited (often older) games. It's a potent combination that makes the 5600X - and the 5600 - the best value AMD CPUs for gaming out there. \nNormally the 5600 retails for £173, in comparison to £185 for the 5600X, but today it's down to £150 on Amazon, coming within £10 of the best price we've ever seen on this model.\nRead more",

Nine times out of ten, it's a sign that something's gone wrong further up the line - that someone, somewhere, has sent out a train with half its usual number of carriages, and is therefore destined to ruin everyone's day in the process by cramming us all in like a pack of sardines. \nIn Afterburn's adorable train puzzler Railbound, however, two carriages are a cause for celebration. In a game that's about guiding numbered compartments onto the back of an engine (using a limited number of track tiles to get them there in the right order), two-carriage puzzles offer the perfect amount of cerebral head-scratching. They've got a bit more bite than simply guiding a single carriage to its destination, but they're not so complicated that they'll repeatedly make you reach for the hint button to help you fill in the gaps. Railbound has a tendency to be a bit too abstract in its later stages, but more on that in a sec. All you need to know right now is that there are plenty of smart ideas to wrap your head around here, and that you'll be grinning from ear to ear by the time you reach the end of the line. \nRead more",

In this spellbinding RPG, players guide bands of heroes through a lifetime of adventure, embarking on dozens of short, whimsical quests wherein they grow, age, and quite literally evolve, with the potential to transform into walking trees, celestial beings, and anthropomorphised crows.\r\n\n\r\nWildermyth is an inspired example of narrative design, with some nifty tactical combat to boot. But when Nate Austin, his wife Annie, and his brother Doug began developing the game around eight years ago, the weight of emphasis between storytelling and combat was very much the other way around.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The gameplay demo caused quite a stir when it was at Gamescom earlier this year, so we made it one of our priorities to check it out here in Seattle.\nNeowiz are not actually at PAX so there wasn't anyone on the team to give us some behind-the-scenes info, but I got stuck into the demo for a solid 30 minutes, brawling with the game's angry robot lads that roamed the city's blood-washed cobbled streets.\nOverall, I had a great time with the demo. Yes, it is incredibly similar to Bloodborne in both its combat and environments but there are plenty of other elements that steer it away from FromSoftware's horror-filled gothic RPG. If you want more details instead of that short summary then check out our video below where I talk about my time with the build, and about having my arse kicked by giant mechanical automatons.

Randy Pitchford made a return to the Seattle stage to let us know what's coming up for Gearbox, but not without some shenanigans first.\nAfter a classic Randy magic trick, a proud display of lock-down Lego builds, and a chaotic bidding war where he auctioned off the literal shirt off his back (which an audience member bought for an eye-watering $1200) we finally got to see some fresh New Tales From The Borderlands gameplay and had a lovely chat with director of production, James Lopez.

As a total freshman to the series, I was a little intimidated by the prospect of sinking my feet into the trenches of a dense strategy bonanza, especially as things kicked off with a literal history lesson.\nBut after watching and absorbing one of the game's early missions, I can genuinely say that I'd be confident enough to give it a go when it comes out. Even perhaps, confident enough to say that I'd genuinely enjoy it quite a bit as a total newbie.\nRead more",

I almost don't want to say any more about it, not because it can be spoiled but because it seems appropriately respectful. Not in a reverent sense, you understand. It just feels like such a world should be preserved, even slightly feared, rather than trampled on by some idiot with a camera in her face.\nTo call Northern Journey \"retro\" would completely misrepresent it. It's beautiful in an ugly, desolate way reminiscent of Kenshi or Morrowind. It's translucent in its exposition but not obtuse, hostile, or obnoxiously hard. It's a bit clunky, without that ever undermining the experience. It's vaguely amateurish, yet almost consciously so, like a painter who knows their talent and intent is enough to overcome any technical flaws. This is a bloody treat and I'm so glad I got to play it.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Since then, Corecell have tried to regain the rights to AeternoBlade 2 from PQube to no avail.

Between its Proteus Spectrum and refreshed Hero models, the G502 has sold boatloads, and was voted as RPS readers’ favourite gaming mouse in both 2019 and 2021. Not undeservedly either, as it’s sat atop our best gaming mouse rankings for years. Making more drastic improvements to it wouldn’t therefore seem like a pressing priority, but Logitech have had a crack regardless with the new G502 X series.\r\n\n\r\nThere’s a trio of redesigned rodents in this family: the standard G502 X I’ve got on review here, the wireless G502 X Lightspeed, and the G502 X Plus, which is essentially the G502 X Lightspeed with added RGB lighting. Since prices max out at £150 / $160 for the G502 X Plus, the two Lightspeed-equipped mice could be less expensive alternatives to Razer’s new DeathAdder V3 Pro and Basilisk V3 Pro – but as the cheapest and most direct successor the G502 Hero, it’s the G502 X that’s likely to see the most desk action.

It'll be viewable here, and since a lot of people are keen on details, here's the full rundown we got from Nintendo:\n\"Tune in at 7 a.m. PT on Tuesday, Sept. 13, for a Nintendo Direct livestream featuring roughly 40 minutes of information mainly focused on Nintendo Switch games launching this winter.\"\n\nBreaking the obvious down, this is a fully-fledged 40 minute non-indie Direct, which will likely focus on first party games as well as \"partner studios.\" Also, it's \"mainly focused on winter games,\" so the bulk will probably not feature titles slated for 2023 and beyond. Maybe we'll get a final tease/stinger at the end for something like Metroid Prime 4.\nThey picked the right time to schedule it, as we're heading into the fall/winter season, and Nintendo needs to start hyping that up. Also, it's TGS week! So folks are already tuning into various streams and the like, and are ready for it.\nWhat we could see in this Nintendo Direct\nAs for what's launching the rest of the year, we have Bayonetta 3, as well as Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. It's possible that Advance Wars could get some sort of update as well, even a new window, if not a surprise launch.\nThen there's Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2 and Metroid Prime 4, which aren't of a \"mainly focused on games launching this winter\" sort; but are still things people have been wanting updates on. A smaller-scale surprise eShop drop could be in the cards too, similar to HAL Laboratory's instant-release projects.\nWhere to watch the 2022 September Nintendo Direct\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ9Iz7HhU-I\nThe post A Nintendo Direct is happening on September 13, 2022 appeared first on Destructoid.",

They were released on September 9, and are available throughout the country in various retailers. As of now, they're also available on the official My Nintendo Store (again, as a two-pack).\nThe figures themselves are true to the Minecraft series, but are less detailed (by design) compared to some of the more premium figures that have been released recently: like the carefully-crafted Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak line.\nIf you need to check with your retailer, here are the details for the two-pack:\nSKU - 115856\nUPC - 00045496893910\nSo what's next for amiibo in 2022 and beyond?\nAfter Steve and Alex, we have the Splatoon 3 amiibo trio confirmed for \"holiday\" of this year, with three figures in tow:\nOctoling (Blue)\nInkling (Yellow)\nSmallfry\nBeyond that, Sephiroth is next up for the Smash wave, followed by Pyra/Mythra, then Kazuya, then Sora. Once Sora hits, the Smash Ultimate line will be fully complete, ending a journey that began in November of 2014.\nOf course, it's going to take a while for that to happen: at least until 2023, given the timeline between announcements and release for these figures.

          "description": "The Defenders of The Night return\nMixed among the frankly suffocating wave of headlines rolling out of Disney this weekend was the curious, but not unwelcome news that The House of Mouse is to release a remaster of its 16-bit release Gargoyles, an action-platformer based upon the cult animated series of the same name.\nReleased in 1995 for the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo, Gargoyles was part of Disney's major push into 16-bit gaming, which would see it adapt franchises such as Aladdin, The Lion King, The Jungle Book, and even Pinocchio (which nobody remembers) for home consoles. Gargoyles was one of the few 16-bit games that licensed a Disney TV show rather than a classic movie, albeit one with a very passionate fanbase.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF7KQjKC-1c\nGargoyles, which first aired in the fall of 1994, told the story of an ancient Scottish clan, cursed to live as stone creatures for all eternity until they are accidentally awoken after their castle is transported to modern-day New York. Now, under the shadows of the night, the Gargoyles protect the people of the city from crime, lawlessness, and corrupt capitalist David Xanatos. The show, much like Batman: The Animated Series, was praised for its melodramatic flair, darker tone, and character relations.\nDetails pertaining to the Gargoyles remaster are incredibly thin on the ground, but the title is expected to launch on PC and \"modern consoles\" at some point in the future. It was not made clear how far along the project is at this moment in time, so it looks like Gargoyles fans will simply have to return to their perch and wait for the coming of the moon.\nThe post Gargoyles remaster will see the 16-bit hit return for modern platforms appeared first on Destructoid.",

The news was broken in a weekend press statement by the publisher.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ODI00fgeS0\nLaunching on September 9, Splatoon 3 sees the return of madcap, team-based, multiplayer gameplay, as squid kids and octolings battle to out to capture territory across various modes and maps. Splatoon 3 features all of the paint-sloshing action that is the franchise's trademark, set against a slightly more dystopian landscape — the aftermath of Splatoon 2's final Splatfest favoring \"Chaos\" over \"Order\".\nBut, despite the series' general popularity, I'm not sure that anybody was expecting the new sequel to be a record-breaker, having already become the fastest-selling Nintendo Switch title in its native Japan. It should also be noted that these figures do not include sales from Europe and North America, which will no doubt add to the incredible number and see Splatoon 3 nestle comfortably in place as one of 2022's best-selling releases.\nSplatoon 3 is available now on Nintendo Switch.

While it looks to a trip way back to Basim in Mirage, several other adventures are on the horizon, including a long-awaited jaunt to Feudal Japan.\nDuring the Assassin's Creed showcase portion of today's Ubisoft Forward, the publisher confirmed its plans for Assassin's Creed Infinity. This AC Infinity will act as a hub of sorts for Assassin's Creed moving into the future, tying together all the different experiences and locales of Assassin's Creed.\nSeveral studios are working on projects for it right now. And as reported earlier this week, one of them is Ubisoft Quebec, which is working on something fans have likely been waiting some time for: an Assassin's Creed spotlighting shinobi. Codename Red will see Assassin's Creed head to Feudal Japan, playing a shinobi character.\nAlso in the works is Codename Hexe, a project from Ubisoft Montreal with Watch Dogs: Legion creative director Clint Hocking on board. No more info was given on the stream, but reports have indicated this will head to the witch trials of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nAn Infinity ahead\nAll of this is part of Ubisoft's plans for the Assassin's Creed Infinity hub, which may have even more in store. Alongside the two codename projects, Ubisoft's Marc-Alexis Côté confirmed that the publisher is looking into ways to incorporate standalone multiplayer into Assassin's Creed again.\nWith a mobile project, Netflix partnership, and more in store, seems like a lot of Assassin's Creed is in store for the coming years.\nThe post Ubisoft teases its plans for Assassin’s Creed Infinity, including Feudal Japan appeared first on Destructoid.",

The good news is that this DLC is free, and is being treated as a customary questline add-on. Eivor will \"reunite with some key characters, including some influential historical ones.\"\nIf you haven't been following along, Assassin's Creed Valhalla was released in late 2020, and it's still trucking through the end of 2022. It hosted expansions titled Wrath of the Druids and The Siege of Paris, on top of the aforementioned free updates and quality of life upgrades. Like most Assassin's Creed games once the DLC stops flowing, it'll make for a pretty packed \"GOTY/Complete\" experience once everything is factored in.

It will explore ninth century CE Baghdad, as the young orphan dives into the world of the Hidden Ones. And yes, that includes cutting a finger off.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x55lAlFtXmw\nThe reveal comes after several reports and rumors about the game. Ubisoft confirmed its existence prior to today's showcase, teasing more to come in the reveal trailer.\nGuiding Basim in his training is Roshan, voiced by Shohreh Aghdashloo. Here's the story rundown from the trailer:\nIn Assassin’s Creed Mirage, you are Basim, a cunning street thief with nightmarish visions, seeking answers and justice. After an act of deadly retribution, Basim flees Baghdad and joins an ancient organization – The Hidden Ones. As he learns their mysterious rituals and powerful tenets, he will hone his unique abilities, discover his true nature, and come to understand a new Creed – one that will change his fate in ways he never could have imagined.\n\nNo firm date has been set yet, outside of 2023.

All these games will be exclusive to Netflix users, who can access them via the Netflix app.\nAlongside the mobile games, a live-action Assassin's Creed series is in the works at Netflix. We've known this has been in development, alongside several animated Ubisoft property adaptations.

          "description": "The Cloud, too\nA Trackmania console release is slated for \"early 2023,\" according to an announcement made in an Ubisoft Forward stream today.\nThe window given right now is \"early 2023,\" and PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Stadia, and Luna were specifically mentioned in the reveal (as were \"cloud platforms\"). Cross-play and cross-progression are confirmed ahead of time too, which is a nice surprise that doesn't require us to dig into a hidden FAQ to figure out if that's actually planned or not.\nIn case you forgot, Trackmania is the shortened title for the 2020 rendition of the series, which launched as a free-to-play game. As of today, a yearly \"club level\" subscription costs $29.99, which has still earned the ire of many prospective players. As Ubisoft puts it, you can: \"Enhance your experience with Standard Access and unleash your creativity. Play solo or multiplayer on seasonal campaigns and keep track of your progression with medal collection, trophies, and regional and worldwide rankings.\"\nThe combination of only being available on PC and the subscription model has squarely put Trackmania 2020 in the \"maybe\" column since launch. At this point, quickly being able to boot it up on a console could sway me to give it another shot.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f5fPTFdv1M&list=PLBnrd5k2F2INdjLweJqlvK0OCRIJPg_O2&index=17\nThe post Trackmania is coming to console and cloud platforms in 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Players can choose from a selection of suspiciously familiar characters with rad names like Matterhorn Decker, The Samurai, Miracle Rastan, and Jimmy Carbon, before battling it out in one-on-one, tag team, and even cage match action.\nCheck out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Janet.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JR1wU0SfGI\nChampion Wrestler is certainly a weird one. The game boasts a selection of nice moves, some fun sprite art, and cool touches such as ring entrances and cheating managers. To play, however, it's a little odd, with the player required to walk around in order to build up power for some of their better throws and holds. Still, all of these flaws fall away at the end of each match, as bizarre wrestler portraits show the winner hanging in casinos, appearing on TV shows, and living in luxury, while the loser is carted off to hospital, quits the business to sell hot dogs, or even turns to a life of crime! A silly but fun touch.\nChampion Wrestler would eventually be ported to PC Engine in Japan, and would also make an appearance as a Virtual Console title for Nintendo Wii. If you fancy stepping into the ring with this odd release, then it is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nThe post Taito’s ring-rocker Champion Wrestler hits the Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

The new edition has been bolstered with a huge variety of new features including two-player couch co-op, a selection of filters and orientation options, and a full suite of modes including Arcade, Practice, Boss Rush, and Overkill modes.

How did it make you feel? The Arrangement manages to showcase the multiple emotions of Sonic Frontiers.\"\n\"Emotions\" is definitely a vibe the team has been going for since Sonic Adventure, and this song hearkens back to the bygone era of the late '90s/early aughts. It's hard to believe this new era of 3D Sonic basically started in 1999, and it's still carrying on today.\nAs for the song, I think it fits. It's not my favorite (I'm way more into the Frontiers ending song, and more into ONE OK ROCK in general), but if the team was going for an old school vibe, I think they accomplished that goal.

But the gameplay seems similar to something like New Super Mario Bros., in the way it has four players navigating the screen together.\nHere's the trailer:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM_PCKwC484\nThe plot seems to follow the Disney pals helping out a group of adorable furballs who need some help. The team will need to unlock special abilities, solve puzzles, and take on bosses to save the island of Monoth. By retrieving all the books from all the biomes, they can save the day. And maybe run into some cartoon-y hijinks along the way.\n\nCo-op platforming adventures\nDisney Illusion Island is in development at Dlala Studios, whose previous work includes the 2020 Battletoads reboot. Although that got some mixed reception, I'm actually pretty interested in Disney Illusion Island.\nThe newer art style of Mickey, Minnie, and the gang has grown on me. Though that's probably due in part to some clips making the rounds on social media.\nAnd a chill, family-friendly co-op platformer seems like a decent time too. I could see this being an obvious pick-up for Switch owners with one kids.\nAs it is now, we'll see more of what Disney and Dlala have in store sometime in the future. Disney Illusion Island is set for Nintendo Switch in 2023.\nThe post Disney Illusion Island is a co-op platformer with Mickey and pals appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Niantic is back with Marvel's World of Heroes\nWho could forget Pokémon GO? It still continues to do well to this day, but nothing will compare to that first summer where it took the world by storm. The game's developer, Niantic, has had a few projects since, and now they've newly announced a collaboration with Marvel to create a game titled World of Heroes.\n \nThe project was revealed today during the Disney x Marvel Games Showcase stream, and all we know so far is that it's coming sometime in 2023. The trailer did include a website where players can go to pre-register, which will likely be up within the next day.\n\nLike I said, the announcement (which I wouldn't even call a trailer because it was so short, to be honest) was pretty slim, but based on what we know of Niantic's games from the past, I think we can take a pretty educated guess as to what the gameplay will be like. I imagine you get to play as different heroes from the Marvel canon, as evidenced by the people in the trailer wielding the iconic weapons of characters like Thor and Doctor Strange.\nFrom there, I could imagine there being bases you could visit in the real world, like the PokéStops in Pokémon GO, powerful items that you can find laying around the world, and I'm sure you'll be able to battle other players, of course. At this point it's pure speculation, so we'll have to see when the game finally drops... whenever that will be.\nThe post Pokémon GO developer Niantic is making a Marvel game appeared first on Destructoid.",

The project is still untitled, but looks to involve both Black Panther and Captain America in the studio's Marvel game.\nThe project doesn't have an official title right now, and was referred to as \"Marvel | Skydance New Media Project\" during the showcase.\nWhile we didn't get a title, what we did see was confirmation of reports that this game would feature both Captain America and Black Panther. Here's the teaser:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f5JMCX1-7I\nWe can catch some glimpses of Black Panther, as well as some claw marks on the shield. We see both Paris and Wakanda as well, and likely some more visual teasers surrounding HYDRA that fans will probably piece together.\nWith the tag \"four heroes, two worlds, one war,\" it will be interesting to see what this team puts together.\nWe'll meet again, don't know where, don't know when\nSkydance New Media is the studio led by Uncharted co-creator Amy Hennig and former Electronic Arts dev Julian Beak. The developer revealed it was working on a new Marvel game last year, describing it as a narrative-driven action-adventure game.\nHennig and co. are also working on a new Star Wars game, which will also be an action-adventure affair.\nBoth Captain America and Black Panther seem like excellent picks for an action-adventure title, and a crossover between the two could go some interesting places. We don't have much to pull out of today's announcement, but hopefully we'll get some more details soon on Skydance New Media and Marvel's project.\nThe post Skydance New Media shows a teaser of its Marvel project appeared first on Destructoid.",

You can play as classic characters like Doctor Strange and Spider-Man, while the game will also introduce a whole host of new or lesser known characters.\nThe game's intro was revealed in a video you can watch below: and the Doctor Strange Defenders skin was announced as a pre-order bonus for all platforms.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dsRsEAHmfw\nIn addition to the new release date, it was also announced that the game's creators will be releasing a series of prequel animated shorts that give us a better look into who these characters are within the world of Midnight Suns. The shorts will premiere on October 31, making Halloween even more exciting this year. Here's the rundown on those:\n\"Marvel's Midnight Suns Prequel Shorts is a set of five short videos that provide backstory on how Lilith became the Mother of Demons, and how Super Heroes like Blade, Magik, Ghost Rider and Nico Minoru came together to form the young core of the Midnight Suns.\"\n\nMarvel's Midnight Suns will officially be out on December 2, 2022 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.\nThe post Marvel’s Midnight Suns gets a new release date appeared first on Destructoid.",

Selling 3.45 million copies since Friday in just Japan, Splatoon 3 had the best launch ever for a Switch game in Japan, as reported by Eurogamer. \nThis includes both digital and physical sales. It's safe to say the squid (and Octoling) community are off to a great start with the threequel that's exclusive to Switch. According to Eurogamer, however, despite the game also being number one on the U.K. boxed charts, as reported by GamesIndustry.biz, overall launch sales are down 9% compared to Splatoon 2 there. The U.K.'s boxed chart only included physical games, though, so it's possible that decline isn't present when digital games are taken into account. There's no word on how Splatoon 3 is fairing in the U.S., but it typically follows trends in the U.K. \n\n\n\"Nintendo Co., LTD...announced that domestic sales of the Splatoon 3 game for the Nintendo Switch system have surpassed 3.45 million units in the first three days since launch on September 9, 2022,\" a Nintendo press release reads. \"This is the highest domestic sales level for any Nintendo software within the first three days.\" \nIt's no surprise Splatoon 3 is selling well in Japan and elsewhere – it's great!

Yesterday we received our first looks at an unnamed Marvel game, a new Tron title, and Mickey Mouse and crew teaming up in a platformer. Today, Marvel and Lucasfilm unloaded a flurry of announcements and trailers for projects hitting in 2022 and beyond.\nOn the Marvel Cinematic Universe front, we learned Fantastic Four will be directed by Matt Shakman, who worked on Wandavision and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Dominique Thorne's Ironheart will take on the villain The Hood (brought to life by Anthony Ramos) in the Ironheart Disney Plus series. Sam Wilson's first mission as Captain America in New World Order will be against The Leader, with Tim Blake reprising this role 14 years after 2008's The Incredible Hulk.\nWe also learned who the Thunderbolts are in the forthcoming film. The team consists of anti-heroes Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko), Valentina (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), Red Guardian (David Harbour), U.S. Agent (Wyatt Russell), Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen, and Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan).\nMarvel also treated us to our first looks at Secret Invasion, starring Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Emilia Clarke in an unknown role. And in just one month, we can watch the classicly designed horror film Werewolf by Night on Disney Plus. You can see both trailers below.\nThe Star Wars news is a bit lighter, consisting of our first look at The Mandalorian's third season, which looks absolutely bonkers in the best way. We also got a glimpse of the animated anthology Tales of the Jedi, hitting on October 26. The Bad Batch's second season hits on January 4, yet no new footage was shown. Andor also received a new trailer for the first season hitting in 11 days. The second season's filming is already underway!

Mickey, for example, seems to be able to bounce off of walls, whereas Minnie has a grapple hook-like rope useful for clearing large gaps.

Then, a few months later, EA announced that its next Battlefield game had entered pre-production using “valuable lessons” learned from Battlefield 2042. \nWhile exactly what the next Battlefield game is remains confirmed, a new Battlefield-centric blog post from chief experience officer of EA Byron Beede and the Battlefield team sheds new light on a possibility. The next game might be a narrative-focused one set in the Battlefield universe. \n“Many of you know that Marcus Lehto joined the team earlier this year,” the blog post reads. “Today, we announced the name of his new Seattle-based studio, Ridgeline Games. Marcus will bring his long legacy of creating fascinating worlds and gripping narratives to Battlefield. Backed by a world-class team, he’ll be leading the charge to develop a narrative campaign set in the Battlefield universe that will engage fans in new and exciting ways while remaining true to the classic elements of the series.” \nAs you can see, the blog post doesn’t indicate that Lehto’s narrative game is the next Battlefield, but it’s a possibility, as is a new multiplayer-focused project like Battlefield 2042. Only time will tell. \nThere’s a lot more in the blog post, including the announcement that creative director Lars Gustavsson, who has been with the franchise since its start more than two decades ago, is leaving EA, so be sure to head there to get the full rundown. \nAre you excited about a narrative-focused Battlefield game?

          "description": "Before Vanillaware made its name with titles like 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim and Dragon’s Crown, it found early success with a little game called GrimGrimoire. The side-scrolling strategy title garnered a cult following when it hit the PlayStation 2 in 2007, but it got another shot in the spotlight this year with the Japanese launch of GrimGrimoire OnceMore in July. Now we know when players in the U.S. and Europe get to experience Lillet’s spellbinding adventure again or for the first time. \nGrimGrimoire OnceMore comes to the west in Spring 2023 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Switch. The game stars Lillet Blan, a witch-in-training who attends the famed Tower of Silver Star magic school, where things have gone awry. It’s up to her to uncover its dark secrets in an adventure that unfolds over a repeating five-day cycle. Though a side-scroller, players battle enemies by summoning and commanding Familiars in real-time strategy battles that unfold in a 2D perspective. \nOnceMore features HD graphics, a new skill tree, an improved user interface, an art gallery, and other unspecified features. \n\n\nFans may remember Odin Sphere making a similar comeback in 2016 with the Leifthrasir edition, and it’s cool to see GrimGrimoire get the same treatment. Are you excited to replay GrimGrimoire? Will this be your first time giving it a try? Let us know in the comments!",

Developer 1047 Games has announced it’s finally bringing the game out of its lengthy beta and launching it in 1.0 next month. It also revealed plans to create another title within the Splitgate universe. But to facilitate work on this next project, it will cease feature development of Splitgate.\n1047 explains in a press release that it’s developing a new shooter in Unreal Engine 5 set in the world of Splitgate, which means it will also feature portals. There aren't any more details beyond this, but it will be the team’s full-time project going forward. \nAs such, 1047 is launching Splitgate out of beta on September 15, but it will move away from creating substantial content after that. However, the team assures fans that Splitgate will remain online. The game’s launch will kick off a new season, which includes a new, free battle pass featuring an infinite number of levels along with new characters, skins, and other goodies. Splitgate’s weekly featured playlists, and item drops will continue, and the team will still work on smaller fixes and updates. \nYou can read 1047's full statement below (click to enlarge):\nSplitgate launched in PC beta in 2019, but the game really caught fire when its console beta began in 2021. The game became so popular on PlayStation and Xbox that servers regularly became congested, to the point that 1047 decided to postpone the full launch and keep the game in an indefinite beta to focus on further stabilizing the online infrastructure as the project continued to receive more funding.

Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. \nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. \nWatch on Twitch!\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, along with Andrew Reiner and Blake Hester, as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure.

Discovery confirms. \nThe first DC Fandome took place in 2020, serving as a livestream alternative to in-person conventions in the wake of the pandemic. It featured virtual panels with celebrities and filmmakers that provided new announcements, trailers, and early looks at all things DC media. In terms of video games, the 2020 and 2021 editions gave us substantial new looks at Gotham Knights and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. \nIn a statement to Popverse, Warner Bros. Discovery explains the decision by writing:\nFandome’s cancellation is an unfortunate blow in the ongoing transition resulting from April’s Warner Bros./Discovery merger. Although only two years old, Fandome has found great success, generating millions of views. Last year's show was highlighted by new trailers for The Batman, Black Adam, and The Flash. Unfortunately, the DC film slate has largely been flipped on its head since then as several projects have been delayed (Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, Shazam! Fury of the Gods), in limbo (The Flash), or canceled (Batgirl). \nWhile we won't see them during DC's big event, Gotham Knights launches on October 21, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League arrives sometime in 2023.\n[Source:  Popverse]",

It also features the first-ever look at the four house common rooms in Hogwarts Legacy, a sneak peek of some of the easter eggs in the game, and more. \nThis new featurette runs more than four minutes long and gives players the most in-depth look at the actual school of Hogwarts in this game thus far. As noted in the video, the design of Hogwarts is based on the eight Harry Potter movies and the books written by controversial author J.K. Rowling, who will undoubtedly be making money from the sales of this game. \nCheck out the featurette for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Hogwarts is looking great, as are the four common rooms. What’s especially interesting is it gives viewers a look at the Hufflepuff common room, which has rarely been seen on screen in the wizarding world, as pointed out in the video. \nWhat’s more, the featurette also contains information about linking your WB Games account to your Harry Potter Fan Club account. Doing so will automatically bring your Fan Club wand into the game alongside your Hogwarts house, which can be determined on the Fan Club’s site through a special sorting quiz. You’ll also unlock some in-game rewards for doing so, too, including a special decorative house robe and a beaked skull mask. Check them out in the gallery below: \n\nFor more, read about how Hogwarts Legacy has been delayed from 2022 to February 10, 2023, and then check out the unique PlayStation 5 DualSense features for Hogwarts Legacy.

It seems Assassin's Creed Mirage will be the big highlight of the show, but it's possible we learn more about Assassin's Creed Infinity, which is Ubisoft's in-development Assassin's Creed live-service platform. We might even learn about non-Assassin's Creed games, too. \nAssassin's Creed Mirage is the next Assassin's Creed game.\n#AssassinsCreed pic.twitter.com/92LoEcrrWs\nSeptember 1, 2022\nIf rumors and leaks about Assassin's Creed Mirage are correct, we're in for a game set in Baghdad with Basim, a major character from Assassin's Creed Valhalla (if you know, you know), as the protagonist. Leaks indicate that he's not yet an assassin at the start of Mirage and instead, a thief who comes to discover the Hidden Ones, which later become the Assassin's order in the series. Rumors also point to this game being a much more stripped back take on the franchise, feeling more like older games in the series rather than the massive and sprawling open-world RPGs of late.\nThe potential for this to feel like a bridge between classic Assassin's Creed and new Assassin's Creed has me incredibly excited. I love the new games, especially Origins and Odyssey, but they're downright exhausting. An Assassin's Creed game I can beat in less than 80 hours? Sign me up!\nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's ranking of every Assassin's Creed game and then catch up on everything announced during the Assassin's Creed 15th Anniversary Celebration stream that aired earlier this summer. \nAre you excited about Mirage?

Among those plans, naturally, is to bolster the value of Xbox Game Pass by adding Activision Blizzard’s library of titles, including Call of Duty, Overwatch, and Diablo.\nSpencer discusses expanding player choice through Game Pass by offering library titles for an affordable subscription fee, appealing to players of various budgets. Spencer hopes that including Activision Blizzard games will make the service more appealing to existing and potential subscribers. \nSpencer also reiterates Microsoft’s promise to keep popular Activision Blizzard franchises multiplatform, citing its handling of Minecraft as an example. Additionally, the company hopes to expand Activision’s portfolio to mobile platforms and make them available to play on other devices via cloud streaming. \nMicrosoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard is projected to be completed sometime during the summer of 2023. After that, it's anyone’s guess as to how long it will be before we see these franchises land on Game Pass. On the Blizzard side, Overwatch 2 launches in free-to-play early access on October 4, and Diablo IV is seemingly years away. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II releases in October, but the series will reportedly skip 2023, meaning the first entry under the Microsoft banner won't be until 2024 at the earliest. \n[Source: Microsoft]",
