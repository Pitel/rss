In the years since, we've seen a pretty staggering number of additions to the franchise, with 25 mainline entries alongside a smattering of spin-offs. There's a lot to dig into here if you're interested, and a whole host of memorable protagonists to get to know along the way.\nWhat started off as a quite fan-servicey simulation in its earlier years, has now blossomed into a full-on RPG affair that balances turn-based combat with an in-depth alchemy system that's garnered a large following of enthusiastic fans, and rightly so. On Nintendo Switch, we've been treated to the best entries in the franchise, with the Atelier Ryza trilogy seeing developer Gust really step up to take the series to the next level.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Seriously, listen to the absolutely nonsensical pop masterpiece 'PoPiPo' once and it'll be in your head for the rest of your days, in a good way.\nThe recently released Hatsune Miku - The Planet of Wonder and Fragments is, without wanting to be too harsh, about as far removed from the glorious arcade magic of Project DIVA as it's perhaps possible to get.

Just days later they were confirmed for multiple other platforms. A Switch version of Persona 5 Tactica was included in this reveal, but at the time there was no mention of Persona 3 Reload for the hybrid platform.\nFortunately, there still might be a chance.

His first project, 1992’s Grind Stormer, acts as a bridge between traditional shooting game motifs and an emergent ‘manic’ gameplay structure. A year later, Batsugun cemented the concept and established the ‘bullet hell’ style — a formula that would underpin everything Ikeda and several other ex-Toaplan staff would go on to achieve at Cave Co.

And it’s an appeal that creator Nate Purkeypile understands perfectly, having spent the larger portion of his career working on Bethesda’s RPGs, from Fallout 3 and Skyrim all the way through to Fallout 76.\n“It’s probably not the best idea for most people to do a solo open world,” he says. “But at the same time, this is like my sixth one.

It's an adventure game with quick-time event bits, and a 50s America setting, all of which could put me off it entirely, but I can't bring myself to say anything bad about it at all.\nRead more",

Wasn't I only delighted, then, to play a bit of Galacticare, an upcoming hospital management sim in the same sticky vein as the hospitals Theme or Two Point. The twist? These hopsitals are in space! Like those managment games, your task is to build a hospital that runs as smooth as some kind of alien baby's bottom (the alien probably has tentacles), where you want to treat people and prevent them from dying as much as possible, but largely because death is bad for your profit margin more than any altruistic impulse. I mean you can be altruistic if you want, I suppose, but if you run out of money it's harder to build more weird bone-fixing machines.\nThe tone - though Galacticare has strange diseases like being eaten from the inside out by a singularity, and wacky treatments including a sort of laser disco machine - is actually much closer to kind of satire-ish hijinks of spacestation management game Startopia than I had expected, thanks in part to the extremely dry AI helper offering input, and the many alien species who'll come to you for treatment.\nRead more",

What happened before that point is never really interrogated during Dordogne's three-hour run time, but we do know her father is a stubborn old goat who cut ties with Mimi's really quite nice grandmother Nora after a summer she spent there as a shy, sheltered twelve-year-old. It's this summer that seems to be the cork in Mimi's memory bottle, and it's also the window in which Dordogne frames its sweet, coming of age tale. As Mimi in the present comes to terms with her grandmother's recent passing, the objects she finds in Nora's now-empty summer house trigger important flashbacks to that golden summer, and maybe also the answer to Mimi's apparent amnesia. Dordogne never demands very much of you during these sequences, but it does know how to luxuriate in life's little details, and find pleasure in a more leisurely lifestyle.\nRead more",

But having played a 30 minute demo of it this week, I reckon it's nothing like COD at all, really. Instead, it's more like Doom / your other retro shooter of choice, but one that carries itself with a frightening seriousness. Sometimes, that's fine. There have been plenty of these smaller sorts of blockbusters that have successfully struck the right balance of silly to serious, with the best ascending to a place of endearment. But so far, Immortals Of Aveum hasn't filled me with hope that it'll join the likes of Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy, or like, The Darkness, as a twinkling beacon of silly fun.\nRead more",

But, come on, look at it. It’s a top-down autoshooter/bullet heaven where defeated beasties drop XP blobs that fuel an escalating series of weapon and stat upgrades, playing out in the whimsical sci-fi/fantasy/corporate nightmare universe inhabited by DRG’s dwarves. \"It’s a mix of Deep Rock Galactic and Vampire Survivors\" is the most apt and succinct description that currently or will ever exist for it. So there.\nAnd yet, being derivative doesn’t always preclude the opportunity for bloody good fun. I’ve played just over three hours of a very early Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor build, and while it’s both missing some parts and could benefit from the odd tweak, it’s already capable of pumping out dopamine as efficiently as any established VampSurvs-alike.\nRead more",

The ceilings are too low, the stairs too narrow, the pipes an afterthought. Jagged Alliance 2 isn't that far gone, but it’s getting there. It gives lots of options for fine control but using them is largely gated behind esoteric, repetitive keyboard shortcuts, which get doubly cumbersome during its awkward transitional moments between real and turn-based movement. \nIt's about leading a group of mercenaries to overthrow the tyrannical queen of a fictional island. A guerrilla warfare sim with great strategic freedom and probably the best turn-based tactical combat ever, all buoyed away from self-seriousness by a campy, irreverent tone and intentionally over the top characters.\nWhat I'm saying is: it's still worth it.\nRead more",

Build rides to attract crowds, shops to fill their stupid mouths, doctors to treat the vomitous and cleaners when the doctors were too late. Punters pay to use any ride, they pay for entry, for toilets and cash machines, and for every item you price in every shop.\nThat's as close as it gets to micromanagement, unless you count finely tuning the position of every rock, shrub, and decorative roof panel. It's more Planet Coaster than the cynical money grubbing of Theme Park, so if you're here for rollercoasters that do stunt jumps over canyons, it's mostly good news.\nRead more",

Everywhere you go, there are grey skyscrapers touching the clouds, so they all look like the concrete's puffing on numerous cigarettes. More often than not, cracked paving gives way to an empty lot or a vacuous car park, often with one guy slumped in a little booth ensuring it stays as grey as possible. So, what better way to commemorate grey than with a look at its president, Armored Core 6: Fires Of Rubicon?\nHaving seen a 20 minute presentation of the game at this year's Summer Game Fest, I'd say it struck me as an action game through and through, with the most recognisable bits of Souls soldered onto it when it came to, say, tough battles set to erratic rhythms. Honestly, I would say the hands-off demo is exactly what I expected it to be: lots of fast bits of metal slamming into each other in what was, perhaps, the least surprising FromSoftware reveal I've seen. Here's a piecemeal, slightly chaotic breakdown of the whole experience, coming to you from the frazzled mind of a jetlagged man sitting at a wobbly table.\nRead more",

As you'll have seen from my big preview, the game itself is a 2.5D platformer that mixes 3D character models and environments with sidescrolling action and dramatic camera movements as hero Sargon doles out his suite of special attacks. But as I was playing I became curious whether the team had ever experimented with going all-in on the anime visuals to create a more illustrated look akin to their excellent Rayman games.

Todd Howard wasn't even wearing a leather jacket, which sort of felt like seeing Scooby Doo without his dog collar. Like, I'd still know it's Scooby Doo, but it wouldn't look right, you know? \nAnyway, all this is to say that the presentation was long. If you're still interested in finding out what was revealed but don't have the time to watch it, however, then good news! I have created a shorter video that highlights the 12 most exciting new details Bethesda showcased as part of the Starfield direct. That's cool, isn't it?

This is a great price for a card that makes a brilliant upgrade from something like a GTX 1060, RX 570 or RX 580, providing significantly better rasterised performance (up to 2x as fast) while also providing those features that weren't available a few generations ago.

Coming to Zuck's Meta Quest 2 headset later this year, Assassin's Creed Nexus will see you slip into the virtual skins of Ezio, Kassandra and Connor in a new story set across Renaissance Italy, Ancient Greece and colonial America. Come and watch the reveal trailer below. Honestly, why does every VR living room look the same in these game reveals? \nRead more",

There have been reports that The Lost Crown's gameplay reveal trailer (which currently sits across five separate YouTube channels) is continuing to rack up significantly higher dislikes than likes since it got announced, and many seem to have taken issue with the trailer's accompanying rap song and that it doesn't look like a \"true\" Prince Of Persia game, whatever the heck that means. It's disappointing to see a game instantly dismissed like this, not least because, as someone who's actually been to Ubisoft Montpellier to play the damn thing, this is arguably the most exciting Prince Of Persia game in years - and certainly more interesting than the troubled Sands Of Time Remake. \nRead more",

It remains unconcerned with telling groundbreaking stories or delivering breathtaking cinema in its fights - it doesn't care.

I'd got my pass, got seated in the theatre and finally had a chance to take in my surroundings. There were lots of folks, obviously, either excitedly chatting or awkwardly swivelling their legs to let people pass. Many wore Xbox jerseys. One man had an Xbox logo shaved into his head. A photographer asked our section to smile, so I managed the pained grin of a British person who encounters a stranger on a walk, the bunching of my cheeks pulling my lips into a curl. Meanwhile, those dressed in their Microsoft jerseys crossed their forearms and hollered.\nThe countdown flashed up on screen and the crowd started chanting, \"five, four, three!\", and for a second it felt like I was the only one who hadn't supped from a bowl of green liquid or beat my chest to the rhythm of \"Play it day one on Xbox Game Pass\". The crowd was on another plane of existence and, for brief moments, I was there with them. At other times I felt the physical fatigue of the trailer train more acutely than ever.\nRead more",

After delighting us with Edo-period Japan in Shadow Tactics: Blades Of The Shogun and the rootin' tootin' tales of the Wild West in Desperados 3, Mimimi have taken a firm step outside their comfort zone with the high seas island-hopping of Shadow Gambit, offering up an altogether different approach to their tried and tested stealth antics. \nAs you might have guessed from the name, its eponymous crew aren't bound by the laws of reality in this latest tactical outing, and their extensive suite of magic abilities really open up the playing field for some creative takedowns. But the canvas on which you're painting these elaborate murders has morphed since the days of Desperados 3, with its handful of islands now offering multiple points of entry, a myriad of different missions and objectives and - for the first time ever - repeat visits to the same locations. It's quite the sea change from Mimimi's previous work, but rest assured: the crown jewels of the Mimimi stealth strategy experience certainly haven't been lost to Davey Jones' locker in the process. If nothing else, this is the most fun I've had with a Mimimi game, period - and I cannot wait to dive back in properly when it launches on August 17th. \nRead more",

The DS title was Ace Attorney director Shu Takumi’s shot to create something new, a “different kind of mystery” from the courtroom battles of Phoenix Wright and friends.\nThough received well, sales seem mixed; it was a best-selling Nintendo DS game in Japan the week of its release, but Capcom would later note it struggled. All of this helped build, at least in my perception, a cult-classic vibe around it. It wasn’t the most popular DS game, but those in the know who dug the DS highly valued it.\nSo that's where we find Ghost Trick now, as it's getting a revival on modern consoles.

          "description": "Mars Needs Cheerleaders\nFollowing a fortnight of run 'n' gun action and top-tier puzzling, we're going back to the stars with Hamster's favorite genre, the shmup — Available on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, it's the Arcade Archives' newest entry, Taito's Megablast!\nReleased to the coin-op market in 1989, Megablast is one of a tidal wave of (admittedly forgotten) shmups that filled out smoky arcade centers up and down the country. While the action is fairly typical of the era, the storyline is one for the ages. Essentially, World Peace has been achieved on Earth, but the planet has been ravaged by an en masse disappearance of women. As it turns out, a dying intergalactic populace known as the Zancs cannot interbreed, and is instead abducting Earth's women in order to help it repopulate its own race. Big ol' yikes on that one, Taito.\nAnd there's no sign of Roddy Piper anywhere.\nCheck out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber World of Longplays.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlaXGd-SUbY&ab_channel=WorldofLongplays\nAnd thus, fighter pilots Dawnson and Bogey are dispatched to confront the Zancs, speed up the extinction process, and bring back the planet's ladies, one of whom is Dawnson's own gal pal. What follows is standard horizontally-scrolling shmup action, depicted in Taito's typically oversized and kinda vulgar fashion. Power-ups can be gathered in order to boost the players' weaponry. Not explained is how our heroes plan to bring all of the women back to Earth in their two tiny, one-man vessels. But if ask too many questions, then the minute of this carefully crafted narrative begins to come undone. So don't.\nMegablast is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at $8.\nThe post Rescue Earth’s women in Arcade Archives’ oddly-plotted Megablast appeared first on Destructoid.",

Being the driving force behind the stories of Grand Theft Auto 5, both Red Dead Redemption games and Max Payne 3 means his absence could lead to some changes for future titles from the GTA developer. That said, seeing as the company has yet to release a new game since his departure, we can't really know for sure.\nHowever, Houser is back with his new company, Absurd Ventures. According to a report from Polygon, this outfit will give the writer and producer a new outlet for some upcoming projects. In a press release, Houser said that he and his team are \"building Absurd Ventures to create new universes and to tell great stories, wherever and however we can.\"\nhttps://youtu.be/n5-9SeQjAEc\nJust what the studio actually has in mind will be the topic of much discussion going forward, no doubt. You can have a look at the Absurd Ventures website for some faint clues, though there's very little there to say about what's in the pipeline. There's also a video promoting the company, but it's a series of bizarre imagery that really leaves more questions than answers. We'll just have to wait to see what the studio conjures up, but given the name that's attached, it's going to be of interest to a lot of people.\nAlong with his brother Sam, Dan Houser is responsible for one of the biggest franchises in gaming history via the Rockstar brand. Grand Theft Auto began life in 1997, with Dan being credited as either writer, co-writer, or producer on pretty much every entry since the London 1969 expansion from way back in the day.\nTo many fans, it will be a little strange not seeing his name in the credits for GTA 6, when that actually comes out. However, there's no doubt that what he has planned for Absurd Ventures will turn heads, especially with the words \"is it OK to dream again?\" seen in the promo video.\nThe post Dan Houser, co-founder of Rockstar, unveils Absurd Ventures media outfit appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Running left to right\nThere's a certain feeling a good 2D Sonic game can elicit. The sense of zipping through levels at a pace that seems way too fast, as even the scrolling screen struggles to keep up with how fast the blue blur is moving, is a core memory for those who grew up around a Sega Genesis. And it's a feeling I got when I was playing the newest Sonic entry, Sonic Superstars.\nSonic Superstars is, to put it frankly, a classic Sonic game. It's 3D in models but 2D in design, though there are plenty of twists to change that up. The base foundation is familiar: you run, left to right, across the screen to hit the goal. Every so often, Dr. Robotnik / Eggman will roll in with an increasingly complicated machine you'll need to bonk your head against a few times.\nThe basics of a classic S…",

          "description": "Head exec says he doesn't know where the Zelda movie rumors came from.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie was a smash hit, leading it to become the second highest-grossing animated movie ever. After such success, making a The Legend of Zelda movie would seem like a logical next step.\nA recent report claimed that Illumination, the studio behind the Mario movie, is already working with Nintendo to make an adaptation of the Zelda series. The rumor spread like Internet wildfire, but there's one problem with this story. TheWrap talked with Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri to ask about a Zelda movie, and it looks like Link's story isn't on the table for the studio. Meledandri even adds that he has no idea where these rumors are coming from. Outside of blind guesses from fans, that is.\n\"I mean I can understand how people would surmise all sorts of things because obviously, we’ve had a great experience working together,\" said Meledandri. \"My relationship with Nintendo now includes being on their board of directors, so I understand how people can surmise these things. But in terms of the specifics, that was just something that I’ve been hearing lots of reports. This is just about what’s next between Nintendo and Illumination.”\n\nRumors every week\nBenjamin Renner, a director at Illumination currently working on Migration, also chimed in about the issue. He says that he sees \"one report every week\" of what their team is working on next, and this one just so happened to be Zelda.\nIllumination, the studio behind other hits such as Sing and Despicable Me, has already fast-tracked a Mario sequel. That could prove to be a reason why a Zelda movie might not see the light of day just yet.\nStill, the success of The Super Mario Bros. Movie has earned Meledandri a seat on Nintendo's board of directors. We'll have to wait and see if Illumination will take on other Nintendo properties in the future.\nThe post Illumination CEO denies report of Zelda movie appeared first on Destructoid.",

Not much information is available so far, but it is listed as a haunted house on the Halloween Horror Nights 2023 event listing. We also got a brief announcement video featuring some clickers.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79JVUnQToU4\nThe event page claims that \"you and your squad will join Joel and Ellie and encounter the haunting and overgrown world in a brand-new terrifying way as you make your way through an abandoned Pittsburgh.\" The announcement tweet also says we should \"prepare to encounter Clickers, Hunters, and more.\"\nFrom gaming to television to amusement parks\nThis attraction continues the multimedia spread of The Last of Us following its highly successful TV adaptation. The hit show has a second season on the way.\nMeanwhile, fans eagerly await the upcoming The Last of Us multiplayer game. The project was delayed with no new time frame last month.\nEven though we don't have many details, this could be a cool experience. The cordyceps fungus has an odd way of being artistically beautiful and terrifying at the same time. An immersive haunted house experience—if done right—could be the perfect medium for The Last of Us.\nAccording to the event website, tickets for Halloween Horror Night range from $79.99-$299.99.

The latest update for the game now makes Naughty Dog's masterpiece compatible with the Valve handheld.\nUpdate 1.1.0 for the game also comes with a ton of tweaks and changes. Looking at the patch notes on Steam shows a healthy list of fixes. Chief among these are important optimizations for CPU and GPU performances, improvements to texture loading, as well as a number of glitch repairs and bug fixes.\nWhen The Last of Us Part 1 was released on PC back in March, the game was plagued with more than its fair share of issues. This led to a series of negative reviews on Steam, as players were understandably upset about the state of the anticipated remake. Several updates have been released since launch, fixing around 40 bugs and glitches, so it's in much better shape these days, at least.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxVyuE2Nn_w\nEasily considered one of the best releases of the PS3 era, the original The Last of Us was a tour de force in video game development and storytelling. A slick remaster was released for PS4 in 2014, while the smash-selling sequel launched in 2020. The Last of Us Part II did split the crowd somewhat, but it was still an impactful game from Naughty Dog.\nDespite the series' reputation, some were skeptical that the studio was remaking something that was barely a decade old and already looked stunning even on previous-gen hardware. That said, the remake enjoyed a positive reception, and the HBO adaptation was highly praised indeed. In short, The Last of Us, as a brand, is doing very well for itself, and now you can even play Part I on the go!\nThe Last of Us Part I is available now on PS5 and PC.\nThe post The Last of Us Part I is now Steam Deck verified appeared first on Destructoid.",

Confirmed as a \"collaboration\" between Feral Games and Crystal Dynamics, the collection (which consists of two spinoff games featuring Tomb Raider hero Lara Croft) was delayed, seemingly indefinitely. But now it's back.\nThe latest news comes straight from a new trailer released by Feral Interactive, which definitively announces a June 29, 2023 release date. While the Switch version won't have any major extra features, it does still have four-player local co-op, among all of the other benefits of playing on Switch.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wlq-VxMgza0\nWhat even is the Lara Croft Collection that's coming to Switch?\nAs a reminder, this collection deals with the two isometric action romps:\nLara Croft and the Guardian of Light (2010)\nLara Croft and the Temple of Osiris (2014)\nWe have reviews for both! And yes, one of them is over a decade old at this point. If you have local folks available, $24.99 isn't a bad price point for what will essentially amount to a weekend of isometric action fun. Each game will last you roughly five hours.\nComparison shopping for the Lara Croft Collection\nYou can find the collection on the Nintendo eShop now for $24.99.\nYou can pick up both of those games, as well as \"every other Tomb Raider title ever released on PC\" on Steam for $28.43 until June 26.\nOn Xbox, the Temple of Osiris + the season pass is on sale for under $5, and on the PSN the Temple of Osiris is available for $19.99.\nGiven the delistings of either game on some platforms (including iOS), the Switch port is making strides in the preservation department.\nThe post Lara Croft Collection is coming to Switch after 2021 announcement appeared first on Destructoid.",

Amid all of the frankly insane devices and creations we've seen the community come up with, this new wave of videos showcases another creative element: music.\nHow the community is creating music in Tears of the Kingdom\nWhat the community is essentially doing is using stakes and lasers [beam emitters] (or other things) to create musical notes, which are then strung together through specific stake placements and item manipulation. Given how easy it is to head to a Zonai device dispenser, amass stakes, and save/quit in a field while experimenting, anyone who is willing can give it a shot.\nCheck out this short tutorial from Twitter user bran8bit.\nhttps://twitter.com/bran8bit/status/1667539615413334017\nSince then, the community at large took this knowledge and ran with it. Take this invention from Twitter user kabukichi00: they use an existing in-game platform to perfectly recreate the ever-present \"Song of Storms\" track.\nhttps://twitter.com/kabukichi00/status/1668898001165877255\nAnother clip from kody_botw shows off how players can manually create music by lifting a laser cannon up with Ultrahand, and even play along with the background track.\nhttps://twitter.com/kody_botw/status/1668587177973026817\nThen there's this clip from noteabletony, who goes a step further and gets a minecart involved.\nhttps://twitter.com/noteabletony/status/1668350921158320159\nWelp, I still have more Street Fighter 6 and Diablo 4 to play, but this is my evening sorted!

Whether you use the PC gaming storefront on desktop, mobile, or Steam Deck, you'll have noticed a few differences lately.\nA short video highlights the new features that have been implemented. In a nutshell, the general layout has been given a \"fresh coat of paint.\" Not so much that it doesn't look like Steam anymore. But is a bit different.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8jv24NjOWQ\nValve has also made notifications \"richer and more useful.\" Make of that what you will. You'll also notice the in-game overlay has been tweaked and now boasts more options for \"better customization\". One of the newest things to be added is a Notes feature which, as the name suggests, allows you to take notes during play. You can even pin it so it stays on top of your game in case you need to refer to it. There have also been some improvements to controller experiences as well, which adds a gamepad overlay and additional \"virtual menus\".\nIf you use Steam on Mac or Linux machines, the new update also enables hardware acceleration for these versions of the client, which should lead to a more responsive experience. That's according to the video, at least.\nThis latest update has been rolled out to all versions of Steam, including the official app. If you want to take a deep dive into the laundry list of changes that have been made recently, you can check out the full patch notes on the Steam website.\nThe post The new Steam client update looks funky, comes with new features appeared first on Destructoid.",

The testing period will run from June 23-26 and will offer up one-on-one online action and limited Klassic Tower battles, obviously with something of an abridged roster.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV175rgyH0k\nIf you want to throw your name in Kung Lao's razor hat, then head on over to the official website and register today. Interested parties will need a Warner Bros. gaming account, (you can register at the time if necessary), and the Mortal Kombat 1 Stress Test is only open to PS5 and Xbox Series X users in North America, Latin America, Europe, and Brazil. Lucky Kombatants will then receive access kodes to download the beta client at some point next week, ahead of the head-ripping khaos.\nMortal Kombat 1 launches September 14 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms. Our own Eric van Allen has already played a build of the exciting-looking scrapper, and you can read his thoughts right here.\nThe post Mortal Kombat 1 ‘stress test’ to take place next weekend appeared first on Destructoid.",

The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey. \nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

You’ll have to sign up on Steam to participate in the alpha, and a new trailer provides some fresh (pre-alpha) gameplay clips. \n\n\nARC Raiders made its big debut at The Game Awards in 2021 and was originally pitched as a co-op PvE experience about players working together to battle invading alien machines. It had been slated to launch last year before Embark delayed the game in order to focus on finishing up its other upcoming free-to-play team shooter, The Finals (which has a second playable beta running now until June 21). Last month, Embark broke the news that it changed ARC Raiders into a more PvP-focused extraction experience, as now teams of players combat each other to retrieve resources in addition to fighting the enemy machines. \nEmbark Studios has not given a release window for ARC Raiders, but they plan to launch it on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

This is the seventh game in the Fire Emblem series but the first in the franchise to be localized for audiences outside of Japan. It first hit the U.S. in 2003. \n\n\nA prequel to Fire Emblem: The Blinding Blade, this game takes place on the continent of Elibe and follows Lyn, Eliwood, and Hector. As you might expect, combat movement takes place on a grid of squares before transitioning to animated attacks. There are different character classes and weapons, and characters who die do so permanently. \nFire Emblem joins Harvest Moon, Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble, and two more games announced for Nintendo Switch Online last week.

Next week, PlayStation fans finally get their turn.\nDeveloper Cellar Door Games has announced that Rogue Legacy 2 will make the jump to PS5 and PS4 on June 20. Like the first game, you’ll take a randomly generated knight boasting a mix of strengths and sometimes hilariously crippling weaknesses through a sprawling castle to kill monsters, collect treasure, and uncover new areas. Between runs, you’ll spend hard-earned loot upgrading your town HQ, and unlocking new stores while improving the traits of your lineage of warriors to raise your odds of surviving subsequent runs. \n\n\nWe awarded Rogue Legacy 2 a 9 out of 10 in our review, with former editor John Carson writing, \"Despite my nitpicks, every new discovery unveiled, skills obtained, and boss defeated wipes away any grief and replaces it with deep satisfaction. There’s a lot to clean up with the core progression systems to make the ramp from beginning to end escalate more evenly, but I’ve enjoyed most of my hours struggling through countless generations of my goofy little bloodline.

Like the game, the plot unfolds on a cursed island consumed by a devastating plague that has warped its residents into dangerous monsters. Only a flame-headed hero of legend can set things right, even though said savior isn’t entirely thrilled with the idea. \n\n\nDead Cells consists of 10 seven-minute-long episodes that will first air exclusively on the French anime streaming service ADN (which is co-producing the show) before becoming available worldwide. \nFor more on Dead Cells, check out our impressions of its last major crossover expansion, Return to Castlevania. If you're looking for other animated series based on your favorite games, Vampire Survivors and Scott Pilgrim vs. The World are just a couple of titles with adaptations in the works.",

Today, it announced it is completing the collection with Apollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy, out in early 2024.\nThe collection includes Apollo Justice Ace Attorney, originally released on the DS, as well as the series' two 3DS games, Dual Destinies and Spirit of Justice. While the games can be played in isolation, they're collectively understood to be entries four, five, and six in the Ace Attorney series, following the events of the original Phoenix Wright trilogy on the DS. The collection will include remastered HD visuals of each of the games while preserving their original styles. This means Apollo Justice Ace Attorney will still be 2D, but the latter two will feature updated 3D sprites.\n\n\nThe Ace Attorney series follows defense lawyers Phoenix Wright and Apollo Justice as they're tasked to defend people accused of murder. The Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Trilogy was brought to modern consoles in 2019, and The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles (a prequel series set during the industrial revolution) came to modern consoles in 2021. Today's newest collection means all of the series' mainline games will be available to play on modern consoles.\nApollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy will be available early next year on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC.",

There's also a look at some of Basim's special powers.\nCheck out the gameplay footage below.\n\n\nNotably, the Assassin's Creed series shifting away from this style of game was, in fact, due to franchise fatigue. 2017's Assassin's Creed Origins took the series towards an RPG slant, furthered by Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Valhalla.

The event will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. \nXDefiant will properly release this summer. The game is free-to-play, and while there's no release date yet, Ubisoft did give us a glimpse into what content will be available in the game's early days. Firstly, everything from the beta periods will be available at launch. This includes 14 maps, 5 modes, and 24 weapons. The game's five factions (Deadsec, Libertad, Phantoms, Echelon, and Cleaners) will be available, as well, though you'll have to unlock Deadsec through gameplay. We also got a quick look at some of the content coming in the game's first year. There will be 12 new weapons and 12 new maps, which is a pretty significant expansion on the game's existing content, but also four entirely new factions.

The RDA has expanded to the western frontier led by John Mercer, who abducts you and other Na’vi to groom you into weapons to use against your own people. After being placed into cryosleep, you awaken 15 years later to a new world and must catch up on what’s happened to stop the RDA. That involves reconnecting with other tribes and learning what it means to be Na’vi again to regain their trust.\n\n\nThe game is a first-person adventure where you’ll wield native weapons like bows and human firearms while also riding atop native beasts. The open-world game features several settlements and clans that you'll travel to using bonded mounts, both ground-based and flying, which you can name, feed, and customize. Frontiers of Pandora also supports 2-player online co-op. \nWe also got a long-awaited release date: December 7. Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

Whatever the case, developer Poncle put out a new trailer during the PC Gaming show, confirming a 1.5 update would be coming to the game tomorrow, June 12. You can see the new gameplay in action below.\n\n\nThe update introduces a bit of new content to the game, most notably the stage Astral Stair, an area of endless corridors and flying paintings. It also includes a spinning wheel that can introduce random elements to the run – and if you're in streamer mode, your Twitch chat can vote to influence its outcome. There are also three new relics, a new pickup called GoldFinger, and a new form for the existing character Yatta Cavallo, which also allows you to evolve their Cherry Bomb ability into a new attack.\nVampire Survivors is available for Xbox, PC, and mobile devices.

To set things right, you’ll travel back to key moments in the past where your actions have a Butterfly Effect on Avalon’s future. Hopping between the past and an ever-changing present shows off the game's complex choice-driven storytelling and reactive role-playing, as you'll meet various versions of characters depending on how you tinker with time. \n\n\nThe game is described as featuring a “deep, narrative-driven world” while the action unfolds in the form of first-person gunplay using steam-powered firearms as well as time-bending technology, such as reversing the time-flow of objects. \nClockwork Revolution is being developed by inXile Entertainment, makers of the Wasteland and A Bard’s Tale series, and is coming “in due time” to Xbox Series X/S and PC. It will launch on Game Pass.",

However, unlike those prior games, this game is likely to draw more direct comparisons to titles like the Elder Scrolls games, or the gameplay perspective of Obsidian’s other successful franchise, The Outer Worlds.\nThe new trailer shows an impressive series of first-person encounters in which we see the lead character wielding both medieval weaponry (and firearms!) along with a potent selection of spells to capture and destroy foes. The accompanying voiceover suggests that the story involves the lead character traveling to an area of Eora called the Living Lands – a part of the world established in the Pillars game as a diverse island to the north characterized by strange weather patterns and strange creatures. The player character arrives as an envoy of the emperor of Aedyr, to look into rumors of an unnatural plague.\nAvowed is coming to Xbox and PC in 2024. Check out the full trailer below.",

          "description": "A stalwart party exploring the unknown, seeking the fabled Inner Sanctum. But all is not what it seems in the world of Varn...\nThe ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for the PC version of the first game of the Might and Magic series: Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Two modes are supported:\nThe original look and feel of the game (sound, which in the original consisted of merely the occasional beep, is not supported)\nA ScummVM-exclusive enhanced mode, which uses the interface of the later Xeen games, including niceties such as better character screens, automapping, and sound effects. It also integrates the impressive \"Might and Magic 1 Graphics Overhaul Mod\", which provides better in-game map and monster graphics. The xeen.cc file is required from Might and Magic: IV or Might and Magic: World of Xeen.\nBoth modes allow saving your game anywhere outside of combat via the ScummVM Global Main Menu (unlike the original game that only saved a single roster when checking into an inn). So make sure you save regularly, just in case you encounter problems.\nHelp us test both game modes by grabbing a daily build and adding mm.dat to the same folder as your game files. Read through our testing guidelines, and please take some screenshots along the way.\nNow, go forth, and discover the true secrets of the game that started the long running epic fantasy series!\n>",

          "description": "As I write this many of the development team and other members of the community are busy having fun at a meet-up in Brussels. Not me though, I’m stuck here doing a release. We’ve been busy refactoring quite a lot of the underlying code to make future changes easier, but along the way we’ve found and fixed a few more bugs and quality of life improvements that we figured were worth releasing sooner than whenever 14.0 comes along. Notably, OpenTTD will now automatically disable hardware acceleration if it detects that the last crash happened while initialising the graphics driver. While hardware acceleration works well for the vast majority of people, it causes crashes for people that then required command line arguments or manual config file editing to get it to work. This should be a better solution for those users. Additionally, there is a change to the default mouse mode on Linux to improve experience when dragging the map (and often to match expected behaviour in other games). As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. While you’re at it, have you seen the post about the upcoming addition of a automated opt-in survey to OpenTTD 14? If you have opinions, we’d like to hear them! Details here. Download Changelog Bug tracker",
