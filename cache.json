For the most part, the series has avoided the FIFA-esque corner-cutting in its Nintendo versions, with the Switch receiving the full game (we know, what a concept!) just like its PlayStation and Xbox siblings. However, it seems that this won't fully be the case with 2K24.\nA new gameplay trailer for the upcoming basketball title showcases the fresh ProPLAY feature — where movements from real NBA games are scanned into 2K for more realistic animations.

          "description": "Something to sink your teeth into.\nVampire Survivors is a singular game. Kind of a roguelike, kind of an arcade game, kind of a bullet hell, but at the same time nothing like what you probably think of when those genres come to mind. After all, there's a reason it captured the hearts and minds of gamers and won handfuls of awards on other platforms in 2022. Jam-packed with rewarding structures, satisfying sound design, cheeky nods to the much more senior vampire-killing franchise that inspired it, and loads of secrets, it'll sink its fangs into you after just one round.\nThe most common way we've heard Vampire Survivors described is, \"A bullet hell where you are the bullet hell,\" but that's only half of the story. You start each level with one attack. They vary from classic stuff you'd expect from a Castlevania game, like a whip, a cross-shaped boomerang, or a throwing axe to more goofy stuff like the aroma of garlic or giant minecarts. There are dozens of them, and each attack has its own strengths, weaknesses, and properties; garlic, for example, creates a miasma of deadly garlic breath, damaging any enemy that dares enter your personal space. The whip slashes out in front of the direction that the player's facing, dealing high damage to anything in its range.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Flutter bye.\nOver the past few years, there’s been a rise in ‘cozy’ games popping up in the indie space, offering an alternative to the typically achievement-based design of pretty much everything else. While these games do require a different mindset due to their generally short nature and simplistic gameplay, there’s something to be said about immersing in something more focused on delivering a brief, simple, and relaxing experience. Flutter Away from Runaway is the latest cozy game to grace the Switch, and while it doesn’t set any new standards for the genre, it’s still a decent experience.\nFlutter Away could be best described as a 'walking sim' with just a hint of Pokémon Snap mixed in there. You play as a city-dwelling woman taking a solo camping trip to a rainforest for a few days, primarily to interact with the extensive butterfly population there. Over the five days of your trip, which together last about an hour in real-time, you’ll hunt three new species of butterfly each day to photograph and document. To get the butterflies to appear, you have to fulfill a series of simple objectives, such as helping a capybara get fruit out of a tree or setting up a campsite, all of which are fulfilled by a point-and-click interaction. The total play area is roughly the size of an actual campsite, so finding the next objective is usually a pretty straightforward process. There are also a handful of optional hidden objectives to fulfill along the way, such as photographing tree frogs.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It should come as no surprise, then, to assume that the iconic fantasy title would have some influence on Nintendo's own N64 adventure title.\nAccording to Did You Know Gaming, however, who recently trawled through an extensive amount of old Nintendo interviews, Ocarina of Time was originally set to include its own original character called 'Hobbit'. This was revealed in an interview with Shigeru Miyamoto himself, who explained that the role of the Deku Scrubs was originally intended for a separate character who would tell stories, sell items to Link, and more.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

You can own property in \"all the major cities in the game\", according to Pagliarulo, with some dwellings being purchaseable and others, quest rewards.\r\n\n\r\nBuilding on the character creation systems of Fallout 3 and Fallout 4, the game features a \"Kids Stuff\" trait that generates parents based on your choice of custom character, allowing you to inflict your terrible physiognomical experiments on at least two other in-game entities. \"No spoilers, but I think fans will really appreciate the actors we got to play those roles,\" Pagliarulo added.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood is many, magical things, but initially, at least, it is a card game in which you create your own cards. This takes the form of an MS Paint-esque editor in which you glue together a background, character assets and a collection of props, rotating, duplicating and altering the size of each asset with the mouse. Each asset soaks up a certain amount of arcane energy, divided between the four elements, which mean somewhat different things here than in the spell systems of other games. And each final design generates a different combination of meanings, some of them contradictory at a glance, all of them keys to the game’s weird, whimsical and sorrowful wider universe.\nIt seems an overly rudimentary system at first, though that’s coming from the perspective of somebody who’s reasonably familiar with Tarot, one of the game’s chief influences, and partial to devising their own crummy decks of visual poetry cards. In particular, I grumped to myself about the limits on shrinking and enlarging: I wanted to fashion more abstract, prog-rock designs with faces in pixellated close-up, whereas The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood sort of defaults to “dude holding thing against landscape” setups familiar from the Rider-Waite Tarot. While there are pieces you can plug in and leave out as you see fit, the system also insists that you include certain props from each batch, and I’ll admit to using the layer tool to hide unwanted skulls, floral wands and so forth behind other assets. \nRead more",

The humans in this far-flung future don’t even remember their ancestral home - it’s just a rumour, a fantasy. Yet that rumour is driving scientist Lisa, as it may be all that humanity has left. Players control a robot, Emeth, trained by the humans Lisa and Makoto to ‘find’ Earth, in the hope that reconnecting with the past will solve the issues facing humanity in the present.\r\n\n\r\nOpus may lean into the sci-fi aspects with its visuals and setting, but The Day We Found Earth and its sequels, 2018's Rocket Of Whispers and 2021's Echo Of Starsong (which Katharine absolutely loved), are ultimately story-driven games with a human core far warmer than the coldness of space. Sigono announced a new entry, Opus: Prism Peak, earlier this year. \"They’re narrative adventure titles that have heartfelt stories that always touch on themes of love and self-fulfilment,\" is what studio co-founder Scott Chen emphasises to me, as we start our conversation on the hectic floor of Bitsummit, Japan’s largest indie games event.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Now, in the relative lull before the monster named Starfield crashes through the ceiling (yes, I know, I'm mixing my scenarios - it's the end of the day and I'm tired), I emerge from the heap reborn as RPS News Editor, and peer back fearfully at some of the doors I left unopened.

          "description": "There are loads of good Steam Deck games – as in, games that happen to play well on a Steam Deck, even if they were originally crafted around desktop hardware and intended to be poked around with a mouse and keyboard. This is a joy of the portable PC in itself: that if you already have a populated Steam library, a box-fresh Deck will immediately have a selection of familiar favourites to install at no extra cost. \nStill. While the Steam Deck doesn’t do exclusives, it does have a killer app. Nearly a year and a half after Valve surprise-launched Aperture Desk Job alongside their handheld, the comedy tech demo remains unsurpassed as a playable introduction to the hardware. Again, there are thousands of compatible games, but if you’ve just recently grabbed a Steam Deck (perhaps via the new official refurb scheme), Aperture Desk Job could hardly be more perfect as an inaugural install.\nRead more",

Will you learn something? Will it occupy your waking thoughts until it's over? Is the commitment of everyone involved assured? Yes. But would describe the experience as restful? Extremely debatable.\nHammerwatch 2 is out today, and it's kind of an isometric RPG that you can play in multiplayer, and which is at base kind of hacky-and-slashy, but has stacking complexity the more you play. It's like paying for ex-special forces lads to read a choose your own adventure book to you, but they get really into doing the voices. I feel comfortable describing the pixel art as \"adorable\", and it makes everything seem like it's a cute little miniature you can hold in your hand. Hence Mighty Max, which was a key part of my childhood. I don't want to say that Hammerwatch 2 is easy, because that isn't quite right and there's some jank lurking in there. But what it is, is easy to get a handle on. It has also functioned as a way of reintegrating my diseased Faerûined mind back into normal society.\nRead more",

RIGHT, ONTO SPOILER TERRITORY.\nI met this really nice bard in Baldur's Gate 3 called Alfira the other day. She was perched on a rock, swinging a sweet medley to a couple of squirrels. Being the bard Edders Sheeran, I wandered over and listened to her perform. She kept getting stuck on some verses, so I helped her fill in the blanks. Then things went Disney, as the camera pulled away and circled her as she performed a beautiful ballad, one dedicated to her late teacher. She seemed content, belting out the ballad. The squirrels, it turns out, thought her voice was awful.\nAnyway, she took me by surprise much later on as I slew the last of some goblin leaders. She snuck into danger just to say she wanted to join our adventures; see the world! I, Edders Sheeran, was thankful to have such a ray of sunshine enter the camp. \"Of course, we'd love to have you,\" I replied. What could possibly go wrong?\nRead more",

The horrors are sort of demi-gods who you occasionally threaten you with plague unless you satisfy some demand. The alternative is to attack them, which the game stresses is extremely dangerous. I might rationalise the choice as the lesser evil, one life sacrificed to spare the lives of several, but the reality is that sending all those dudes back and forth across the map just sounded like too much hassle.\nRead more",

Each realm has a different layout, architecture and ambience, and you'll need to alternate between them to expose routes and bypass obstacles, as indicated by clumps of ashen butterflies, making your way back to Axiom by means of an Effigy of Emergence.\nYou're also dropped into Umbral when you die, which gives you another chance to bump off whatever it is that slew you; die a second time, and you'll have to restart from one of the game's Vestige bonfires. Another thing to worry about: the longer you spend in Umbral, realm of death and despair, the more numerous the monsters that spawn from its shadows. I'm hoping the two-worlds mechanic will mutate the game's many debts to Dark Souls into a brand new playstyle (though as Ed Superior noted in his Lords of the Fallen hands-on, it stands up pretty well as a straight Souls clone). It already poses some fun possibilities for the ever-thorny question of multiplayer.\nRead more",

And we get to read a little about a few key Starfield characters, such as space cowboy Sam Coe, careworn ex-soldier Sarah Morgan and sciencehunk Barrett.

          "description": "For all the big-budget GeForce graphics cards, it’s the firmly mainstream XX60 models that must surely keep the lights on at Nvidia HQ. A glimpse at the current Steam hardware survey reveals that the RTX 3060, RTX 2060, and GTX 1060 are all within the top four most-used GPUs – with the RTX 3060’s laptop version at number five. These are important cards, and messing up the next one would be a disaster.\nThe RTX 4060 is not a disaster. Ultimately, it a very capable 1080p graphics card, a technical upgrade on the RTX 3060, and (unlike several other RTX 40 series GPUs) arrives at a reasonable price. But it probably doesn’t deserve the apparent immortality of its predecessors, with only modest gen-on-gen performance gains and a heavy reliance on DLSS (including DLSS 3) to expand that difference.\nRead more",

          "description": "In the picturesque Regency town of Leamington Spa, a debutante has entered the local high society of AAA game developers. Named Maverick Games, it’s led by the former director of Forza Horizon 5 - a creative risk-taker named Mike Brown. “Games are made in a very certain way that brings with it real security,” Brown told GamesIndustry.biz in January. “We know that if we do these things in a row, we will hit this date and the game will come out. I think there are other ways where you can still hit that date, but also do a load of new things on the way.”\r\n\n\r\nOne of the new things Maverick is backing is Jamie Brittain, lead writer on the studio’s unannounced open world game. Brittain has never worked on a videogame before. Yet any millennial who grew up in the UK will undoubtedly be familiar with Skins, the epochal teen drama he co-created with his dad, Bryan Elsley.\r\n\n \nRead more",

If you're new to the much-imitated Vampire Survivors format, the idea is to steer an auto-attacking character around a map that is slowly invaded by increasingly hazardous waves of foes, levelling up as you go. Think of it as a bullet hell shooter, but set to the tune of a walking sim. At first, anyway: at higher levels, Vampire Survivors is a perfectly withering experience, for all its initial glacial pace.\nRead more",

          "description": "Game designer, sometime Gears of War frontman and nowadays, comic book author Cliff Bleszinski would very much like Epic to make another Jazz Jackrabbit. In case you're unfamiliar, or disgracefully young, Jazz Jackrabbit was a platform game for MS-DOS, published in 1994 - it was Bleszinski's first project as a designer for then-named Epic MegaGames. He worked on the game alongside coder Arjan Brussee, who would later found Guerrilla Games before moving to Visceral Studios and finally, reuniting with Bleszinski to launch Bosskey Productions, the ill-fated creator of the generally rather decent Lawbreakers. Cor, people don't half move around in this industry.\nI never played Jazz Jackrabbit - if memory serves, the first in the series launched during a particularly cursed/blessed (delete as appropriate) part of my early youth, when my gaming consisted exclusively of shareware titles on Apple Macintosh. But I can certainly get behind Bleszinski's follow-up remark that he'd like a potential Jazz Jackrabbit 3 to be a first-person game in the vein of PS1 classic Jumping Flash.\nRead more",

          "description": "Little-CRPG-that-could Baldur's Gate 3 has solved the Labyrinth, outwitted the Sphinx and ascended to the rank of Metacritic's highest-rated PC game of all time, knocking ZA/UM's Disco Elysium into second place. (OK, so technically they're both on 97, but I'm guessing the \"score distillation\" arithmetic behind-the-scenes puts Baldur's Gate 3 ahead - their positions were reversed last time I checked.) This follows a busy weekend for Larian's new game, which exceeded its own online player activity record on Sunday to the tune of around 875,000 players.\r\n\n\r\nIt's a terrific achievement for one of the richest and most rewarding D&D adaptations ever set to code. It's also only going to encourage those on the interwebs who are using Baldur's Gate 3's success as a stick to beat other developers with. As you've likely discovered for yourself, the new game is the centre of a raging discussion about what we should expect from today's \"triple-A games\", aka \"biggest/shiniest\". Some point to its lack of microtransactions or DRM, while others highlight its relative technical sturdiness and overall \"quality\". A few people go into specifics: I've read a couple of thoughtful comments comparing the bespoke, one-and-done nature of Baldur's Gate 3 quests with open world action titles and other genres that hinge on repeated quest formulas and reward systems.\r\n\n \nRead more",

In a pre-reveal showcase attended by RPS, producer Andreas Schmiedecker walked us through a few sections of this atypically green-fingered open world shooter.\nIn Outcast: ANB you play a growly-gruff ex-Navy SEAL, the sleekly named Cutter Slade, who roves a planet called Adelpha using a fancy jetpack. You're here to help the indigenous Talans - who definitely hail from the Ewoky end of the ethnic representation scale - fight off an army of robot invaders. The jetpack is the initial star attraction: it lets you boost, glide and dash through colourful landscapes inspired by 80s and 90s movies and comics. The associated animations seem a bit wooden to me: I often felt like I was watching somebody steer a man-shaped cursor, rather than a body in flight. But I certainly can't argue with the verticality and agility on display.\nRead more",

The new game is the work of Grimlore Games, creator of Spellforce III and one of THQ Nordic's first internal development studios. It sees you hunting down Nemesis, goddess of retribution, who has gone a bit do-lally and is meddling with the Threads of Fate.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I admit, I was a little piqued by Homeworld 3's redesigned Mothership, which lies flat as a doormat - an act of blasphemy akin to flipping a crucifix upside down, or wearing a baseball cap backwards in your 50s.

At the time of writing, the game has attracted 22,619 reviews, many written by people who've already been playing for a while on Battle.net, of which just 15% give the game a thumbs-up, making for an \"Overwhelmingly Negative\" rating. Tucked in amongst the usual troll reviews, cheeky links to Team Fortress 2 and dubious ASCII jokes there are some rather extensive essays on the game's direction and faults.\r\n\n\r\nMany players still have axes to grind about Overwatch 2's switch to a free-to-play battle pass model - check out our launch-day Overwatch 2 review for the nitty gritty - which introduced levelling for new characters and cosmetics to a game that once handed you its entire roster almost without caveats, and encouraged you to experiment freely. Others are angry about Overwatch 2's story-driven PVE modes, the supposed focus of the sequel - announced as a full-blown Hero Missions mode with skill trees and levelling, then dramatically stripped back to a series of separately sold seasonal co-op missions, much as with Halloween events in the first Overwatch. There are complaints about Blizzard's recent handling of the Overwatch League, and more subjective quibbles about the switch to a 5v5 team format and the precise ratio of DPS to Support heroes. A few reviews touch on Activision-Blizzard's alleged culture of sexual harassment and claims of unfair labour practices, which make Overwatch's emphasis on team spirit ring rather hollow.\r\n\n \nRead more",

As the name suggests, it's all about doing mildly game-breaking things with barrels, crates and other heavy containers, by taking advantage of high strength, the Throw command, and the fact that Larian RPG characters can somehow fit items as big as they are into their inventories, without bursting apart like rotten haggis.\nA straightforward tactic: consider lugging a few oil barrels into a throne room, and dropping them all around the resident big cheese before you confront him. Given reasonably careful distribution, it's possible to finish a whole battle this way in a single turn. Fortunately, while Baldur's Gate NPCs can be eagle-eyed when it comes to sneaking rogues, they're perfectly indifferent to people surrounding them with heavy explosives.\nRead more",

All that changes with Modern Warfare 3, however, which brings across a \"vast amount\" of content from Modern Warfare 2, including guns, attachments and cosmetics.\nRead more",

          "description": "I've been bolting together some ideas for a longer Starfield feature and while plying the sliplanes of Reddit, stumbled on this conversation about the game's handling of time. As many of you will know/be very weary of hearing, Starfield features hundreds of planets, together with moons and space stations, scattered around the galaxy in different solar systems. Real-life planets, of course, aren't fixed points: they rotate and orbit their stars at different speeds, depending on their mass and distance, which means that days, nights and seasons have different durations. \r\n\n\r\nStarfield appears to model this to some degree. Bethesda's Starfield Direct from June makes a fleeting distinction (thanks, JuiceHead33) between \"local time\", corresponding to where you land on a planet's surface, and \"UT\", which sounds like an abbreviation of \"universal time\", and presumably describes the passage of time throughout the wider galaxy. Both are displayed in 24 hour format. You can explore planet locations at different local times, as indicated by your fancy neo-Casio watch, with shifting lighting conditions that seem to correspond to the spinning of the planet around its sun. There's footage showing one particular area, The Hitching Post in Akila City, by day and night. The game also seems to model planetary alignments - there's the beginnings of a solar eclipse visible during one segment of the video.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Obviously, this means Stray Gods has some top-notch voice talent on board, but these casting choices also make another kind of sense. The premise of this 'roleplaying musical' is inspired by the Buffy the Vampire episode 'Once More With Feeling', you see, and as in that piece of classic TV, part of the appeal is seeing (or hearing) performers who famously earn a crust in more action-oriented roles forced to prove their singing chops instead.\nThankfully, The Last Of Us crew all have a finely tuned set of pipes on them, not least Bailey, and the notes they belt out absolutely do this game’s charming and entertaining concept justice. Even better, they’re ably backed by the admirable composing skills of Austin Wintory, a fizzy script and pitch-perfect character design.\nRead more",

I'd played this bit before in early access, so I knew to fireball the tiny bit of rope to drop the big stone down into the floor and take out the rest of the bandits hanging about up there pretty sharpish. But before I went down beneath the chapel (there were a lot of other nasty bandits down there last time I checked), I had a little extra nose around the outside, eventually discovering a locked hatch down a nearby cliff path that took me to the brilliantly named Dank Crypt.\nSensing not all was well down here, I went into hiding mode and gingerly crept around the place, looting the handful of corpses lying about of their gold and spell scrolls, but leaving their weapons. You see, I have a terrible habit in RPGs of stuffing my pockets with absolutely everything I can find. In Bioshock, I will scavenge everything out of every bin like some feral raccoon; in Skyrim, I had to enable a cheat code for infinite storage one time because I was so overencumbered (and couldn't bear to part with everything I'd picked up over the course of the quest) that I actually couldn't move. And in my early hours of Baldur's Gate 3, I started doing exactly the same thing, looting everyone's swords, daggers and crossbows up on the Nautiloid. Not to much effect, mind. Nothing was really that much better than what I already had. So I resolved to do better and resist temptation. And what a dumb idea that turned out to be... \nRead more",

Well, some of us like to think of ourselves as serious journalists, thank you very much, so I'd like to call your attention to the, dare I say, more grown-up elements of the patch, which range from fine-tuning the tooltips to making dragons appear in the right place.\r\n\n\r\nTear your eyes from those lurid details of absentee knickers and glitchy sausages, and you'll see that Larian has fixed no less than 13 crash bugs and progress blockers, though sadly not the crash bug I always seem to get when I run the game in DirectX 11. They've also sorted out an issue with enemies entering combat when they're on a different floor, together with the occasional odd prolonged silence in over 200 dialogues, and a smattering of minor issues with cameras and clipping.

And I think in the end - not 'I think', I know, in the end, it was the wrong decision to keep on pushing on it. Now [the reason I did it] was when we still independent and we were selling it, it was a more interesting game to publishers. And when you're asking for $50, $60, $70, $80 million, you have to have something interesting to talk about. And multiplayer made it interesting.

The original Xbox 360/PS3 game launched with a tidal wave of bugs, some of them game-ending. One particular collection of technical gremlins trapped me on a farm during the prologue. Having sat through some cutscenes, I found myself at the centre of a strange spacetime distortion redolent of the other world in Neil Gaiman's Coraline. If I tried to leave the farm the simulation slowly broke down, with movement consisting of weird fragmentary teleports. \nI saw a distant rider stop-starting through a canyon with his own hat darting through the air behind him. I followed the man for as long as I could, before tumbling through the terrain into uncreated space. Proper Lynchian stuff. Red Dead Redemption 2 had its share of bugs and glitches, but none of them quite as captivating as this. Still, it would have been nice to see the world beyond the farm, and that was my first thought when Take-Two Interactive and Rockstar announced a new Red Dead Redemption port, for release on 17th August. Sadly, however, the port appears to be PS4 and Switch-only for the moment, though a PC release might happen if the stars align.\nRead more",

          "description": "Sega have formally unveiled the next steaming helping of Total Warhammer 3 DLC, Shadows of Change, which adds three Legendary Lords to this already-jam-packed strategy game: the Changeling for the demonic Tzeentch faction, Yuan Bo for Grand Cathay, and Mother Ostankya for Kislev, plus a brace of new campaign mechanics, units and battlefield abilities. \nI've been going off Total War lately - I fired up a new Lizardman game last month, having developed a hankering for dinos after reviewing Exoprimal, and found myself lingering in disappointment on each faction's reliance on rock-paper-scissors unit relationships. There's only so many times you can do that dance of shieldwalls before it loses its charm. Still, it sounds like the new Tzeentch Lord might wash away my Total Warennui, in being one of those playstyles that is more about tricking and invading rivals than taking territory.\nRead more",

          "description": "I am but a stripling level 4 sorcerer in Baldur's Gate 3, still learning to distinguish my Magic Missiles from my Chromatic Orbs, my Cantrips from my Colour Sprays (or at least, restore my memories of these concepts from my long-ago Baldur's Gate 2 playthrough). I've just discovered the finer applications of Mage Hands, which are a great antidote to goblin archers - simply spawn one behind the offender, use it to hurl them from the cliff they're standing on, and chuck a nearby crate after them for good measure. Magical indeed! Or so I thought, before I read about the real spells that lurk at the top of the level-up ladder in the D&D player handbook. \nThese feats of wizardry make Mage Handing seem about as otherworldly as setting an alarm clock. Take Wish, a ninth level conjuration that allows you to \"alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires\", up to and including generating pricey equipment from nothing and rewinding time. Or how about Prismatic Wall, which spawns an ephemeral barrier 90-feet long, made up of seven layers that inflict a different effect on any creature passing through, from poison to petrification? Spicy enough for you, goblin archers? Sadly, it doesn't sound like either of these spells is hidden away anywhere in Baldur's Gate 3, which caps progression at level 12. And it's far from certain that they'll be added in the shape of an expansion pack. There's a good reason for this: higher level D&D spells and abilities are so potent it's hard to include them without turning Baldur's Gate 3 characters into gods.\nRead more",

          "description": "Baldur's Gate 3, out of early access last week, is an officially licensed D&D RPG of many hours of turn-based combat, as you bring together a rag-tag group of misfit heroes to save the world from a mysterious cult. And also every single one of those misfit heroes wants to get at you. In many cases with zero prompting from you whatsoever. It doesn't end with your team companions either; by my loose estimations, any character who is in upwards of three cutscenes comes with a 70% chance of propositioning you. There's one romance option that I experienced effectively as a jump scare, entering a cutscene to see a character suddenly and casually-not-casually shirtless. It never ends. In hindsight, picking from a selection of genitals in character creation was probably a clue.\nRead more",

Assuming you can still access the game at all.\n\"I don't like the word 'retro game',\" Kamiya told VGC in a wide-ranging interview also notable for some chunky insights on onomatopoeia in Japanese manga and its US adaptations. \"I'm obviously not a native English speaker so it might be something I'm interpreting from a Japanese perspective, but hearing the word 'retro' from a Japanese viewpoint, suggests more of a 'fad' brought back from a past era and reskinned for the current era.\"\nRead more",

But for the citizens of Videoverse, an online community that's part and parcel of the soon to be defunct 1-bit video games console the Kinmoku Shark, this sense of an ending is something that many of them aren't equipped to deal with, least of all teenager Emmett, who's just discovered the fan page for his favourite video game, Feudal Fantasy. \nAs he deals with the prospect of having to bid farewell to friends old and new, including the mysterious but talented fan artist Vivi, Videoverse taps into a potent and nostalgic melancholy. It's a love letter to the early internet at its rose-tinted best, and to the lost, formative spaces that brought so many like-minded individuals together and gave them a sense of purpose. Yes, there are trolls spoiling everyone's fun, and yes, there's a hint of something more nefarious going on underneath Videoverse's source code. But another Hypnospace Outlaw this is not. Rather, this is a proto-internet tale that's all about the friendships we form online, and the bonds that carry us forward when real-life relationships just don't cut it anymore.\nRead more",

Upon its launch, there wasn't much else like The Room on VR devices, a dedicated puzzler with high production values that didn't feel the need to throw in a gun to shoot or a melon to chop. Now, there are bunch of fantastic VR brain-ticklers swimming in the pond, such as the time-travelling epic Wanderer, the perspective-bending A Fisherman's Tale series, and the ingenious automation extravaganza The Last Clockwinder. \r\n\n \nRead more",

I quit playing Frank And Drake twice before even meeting its second protagonist, but something about it kept pulling me back.\r\n\nIt's partly the style. Some gorgeous rotoscoping gives its few characters a sense of constant motion that's unreal and very lifelike at once, and it's sometimes pushed further by having them decelerate to a blurred freeze frame when you stop walking. The backgrounds are static but interactable things shimmer a bit, like in old cartoons where you could always tell what was background and what was going to do something.

Tato zranitelnost, označená jako CVE-2022–40982, umožňuje uživateli získat přístup k datům jiných uživatelů, kteří sdílejí stejný počítač, a ukrást je. Například škodlivá aplikace získaná z obchodu s aplikacemi může útok Downfall využít ke krádeži citlivých informací, jako jsou hesla, šifrovací klíče a soukromá data, například bankovní údaje, osobní e-maily a zprávy.

The bar has been set at 7 minutes, 54 seconds, as speedrunner Mae was able to charm the pants off of Lae'zel in that time. In Baldur’s Gate 3, I mean.\nMae had previously proven that Baldur’s Gate 3 can be completed in around 10 minutes, which is roughly how long I’ve spent in the entire game (that’s not a condemnation, I’ve just been busy with other things). But really, getting is the real goal of CRPGs like Baldur’s Gate 3. Saving the world is just something you do to meet potential partners.\nhttps://youtu.be/C-Rkgdcj5Ds\nThe video is generally what you’d expect, but fascinating all the same. Mae uses a lot of the normal techniques used to speedrun the game’s opening. They then focus on freeing Lae'zel and getting on their good side. They then settle down in the romantic light of a campfire, sneak away into the night, and submit to their base urges. Hoo boy. I just love a partner with focus.\nFrankly, 7:30 minutes of foreplay can be a bit disappointing. Hopefully, the after-glow and pillow talk aren’t part of the run. I wouldn’t recommend speedrunning intimacy with your partner unless you’re on break at the office or waiting on a bus. However, in this busy world we live in, aren’t we always aiming to be more efficient? We often try to minimize and abbreviate our pleasures so we can get back to what really matters: doomscrolling across the dying remains of social media.\nAlright, so now we’ve seen the current Baldur’s Gate world record for copulation. Let’s see you do better. Or worse? I’m not sure anymore.\nThe post How quickly can you go from zero to romance in Baldur’s Gate 3? 8 minutes, apparently appeared first on Destructoid.",

It also promises video features, playable prototypes, and design documents providing an in-depth behind-the-scenes look at Mechner’s work. Digital Eclipse has even gone to the work of extrapolating on a prototype to provide it into a full-fledged game called Deathbounce: Rebounded. It’s a dual-stick shooter, which is a pretty great sub-genre.\nhttps://youtu.be/IrS2pipZaH0\nDigital Eclipse has last tested the interactive documentary concept with the Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration. It goes beyond the simple remaster format by going in-depth into the making of the games. Karateka is a great starting point, as Mechner made it years before the more renowned Prince of Persia. It’s a formative game known for its cinematics and rotoscoped animation.\nI personally haven’t played Karateka. I’m pretty sure I have a copy of it for my Commodore 64 that I haven’t dug into yet, but I’ll probably just wait for this release to try it. After all, it’s out in just a couple of weeks. The Making of Karateka releases August 29, 2023 on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.

However, things promise to not be as they seem, which is great because they already seem weird and unsettling.\nLike many text adventures of the early PC days, [I] Doesn’t Exist doesn’t just provide you with walls of descriptive text. It also uses graphics to depict its strange world. Beyond that, there are animations, so you don’t have to rely on your unreliable imagination to paint you a picture.\nhttps://youtu.be/91PdAe-n5VA\n[I] Doesn’t Exist also touts the use of \"Natural Language Processing\" to support its parser and make things more intuitive. While this means the use of AI, the developer is quick to clarify that it isn’t involved in the creation process and is just to make the language parser more natural. In their words:\n\"Publisher DreadXP and developer LUAL value the authenticity of human-made narratives, and none of the in-game text in [I] doesn’t exist is AI-generated. The Natural Language Processing technology utilized in the game is not affiliated with ChatGPT or other similar AI platforms and utilizes only the player’s input to access pre-written responses by the game’s super-cool writers.\"\nThat’s rather comforting because we all know how well it went when Square Enix tried to make a text adventure using AI.\n[I] Doesn’t Exist launches on PC on September 9, 2023.

For example, they're giving away a TUF Radeon RX 7900 XT graphics card, a B650-Plus motherboard, some peripherals, and some merchandise.\nIf you want in on this, you just have to head to the competition page and follow the instructions. The event goes on until August 29, and winners will be selected at random and contacted by Nexus Mods.\nIt's difficult to unbridled the sheer hype for Starfield.

And it's not out of a lack of interest in the medium from its creators. Twin Peaks writer and director David Lynch once started to work on a game that would continue the series called Woodcutters From Fiery Ships, and Mark Frost, Twin Peak's co-writer, met with the creators of Link's Awakening to give them a few ideas.\nThen in 2019, both of them signed off on a Twin Peaks VR project, though it's more of a collection of interactive sets than a full game.

It’s an over-the-top basketball game in the vein of NBA Jam. Two robots face a team of two other robots in a match of ups. Beyond just scoring some hoops, your robots are equipped with weapons and can dunk from the edges of space. Also, everything is made of wood for some reason.\nhttps://youtu.be/OP55pjjMSkI\nThere’s also a roguelite progression where you try to make it as far as you can across various rounds of b-ball. Once you’re inevitably smacked back down to Earth, you can upgrade your robots or hire new ones.\nAfter I wrote my preview for Robodunk, the developer reached out to me to get me to extrapolate on my feedback. At the time, one of my biggest issues was that I felt there was a dearth of personality to the whole affair, despite how over-the-top everything was. He pointed out to me that there are apparently lore entries that get unlocked as you play. What!? In a basketball game? No wonder I didn’t see them. That’s the last place I’d expect to find them.\nSo, I’m eventually going to play the full version, and I’m definitely going to check out these lore articles that give context to the automated dunks happening in the foreground.\nYou can check out Robodunk and its lore on September 25th, 2023 on Switch and PC.

There's also been a public post on Twitter confirming that, yes, the \"Ascension\" update is inbound and will be going live on August 17 from 10AM UTC onwards.\nhttps://twitter.com/KineticGame/status/1691407479119192065\nIf you want to get in those last few levels before Phasmophobia goes through these changes, now's the time.\nEverything changes\nOver a series of dev posts on Steam, we've learned that a lot of things are going to be different in Phasmo. For one, there's some new equipment, which is now going to be tiered. Everyone is also having their levels reset to 0, but it's been said that you will be given a badge that indicates where you were before the update. The patch was supposed to be rolling out a little earlier, but the people at Kinetic said they had to delay it a little bit.\nPhasmophobia is also coming to consoles, with a projected release date of...well...sometime this month.

Not only is the game a hit commercially and critically, but the development team is also addressing multiple pain points due to player feedback, which you always love to see.

          "description": "Forklift Interactive has launched Stage Games Inc’s production strategy game, Desynced, into Steam Early Access today.\nDesynced is part automation game, part base-builder, and part RTS. You find yourself stranded on an unknown world and need to manufacture parts to repair your ship. You take command of a horde of drones that you use to extract resources and take them to various facilities to be processed. It bills itself as an “automation game without belts.” There’s a detailed system for programming your drones to work more autonomously, and you can also bring in other players for multiplayer.\nhttps://youtu.be/SLVZlg7sp9E\nMeanwhile, there is also an RTS aspect to Desynced, where you have to protect your factory. That seems like a worthwhile wrinkle to me since being able to diagnose and repair damage to your automated systems sounds pretty fantastic.\nWhile the automated production genre has been seeing a lot of growth in the indie sphere over the last few years, I haven’t taken the dive yet. I’m not entirely sure why. For one thing, it’s a genre that can only really flourish outside of mainstream gaming, which is something I love. I also enjoy management games. I think I’m afraid of getting sucked in and finding myself having difficulty uncoupling when it comes time to play a game for work. That’s a pretty good problem to have.\nDesynced is available for PC through Steam Early Access starting today. Stage Games is estimating that it will stay in Early Access for a year before reaching completion.\nThe post Production strategy game Desynced launches on Early Access today appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "HoYoverse announced via social media channels that two new characters will be coming to Genshin Impact: Wriothesley and Neuvillette.\nWhat do we know about Wriothesley and Neuvillette?\nWriothesley (apparently pronounced “rizz-ly” or “rise-ly”) has a Cryo Vision and is the Lord of the Fortress of Meropide, which is some sort of prison at the bottom of the sea. He is Ousia-aligned; although his previous character art showed him with a Pneuma Vision shape, this was swiftly corrected. Aside from this, we know nothing about his weapon or kit, and will have to wait for further announcements to see how he plays.\nNeuvillette is much more mysterious, with some of his information censored with triple question marks. We do know that he is the Chief Justice of Fontaine and some kind of father figure to the Melusines. He is likely very important to the main story in Genshin Impact, which would give a reason for all the secrecy. Neuvillette uses Hydro, but not through a Vision. What exactly he is and how he uses his powers are a great mystery, possibly with answers in upcoming Archon Quests.\n[caption id=\"attachment_396793\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"] Image via HoYoverse[/caption]\nWhen are Wriothesley and Neuvillette coming to Genshin Impact?\nDrip marketing like this usually comes in two versions before the characters are released. This means we can expect Wriothesley and Neuvillette sometime in Version 4.1 of Genshin Impact. Whether they will be in the first half or second remains to be seen, along with who will accompany their banners. \nIf you are interested in either of these characters, you may want to start saving Primogems now.\nThe post New characters Wriothesley and Neuvillette announced for Genshin Impact appeared first on Destructoid.",

He was – let's not mince words here – a monstrously irritating NPC, and now someone taken that monstrosity and actualized it in physical form.\nOver on Nexus Mods, user theocddragon simply asks \"good heavens what have I done\" with a modification for Oblivion that turns everyone's favorite Wood Elf to hate into an unholy sight. Seriously, it's like if the Adoring Fan was rejected from Tim Burton's Beetlejuice for being too odd.\n[caption id=\"attachment_396762\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"] Image via theocddragon/Nexus Mods.[/caption]\nEditing the character model, the modder has reconstructing the NPC's face using a dragging tool that has resulted in the severely morphed image of this once annoying–though wholly innocent–citizen of Cyrodiil.\nKill it with three fires\nDescribing it as an \"eldritch abomination with one singular eye,\" theocddragon has unleashed a nightmare unto the Oblivion community and those who witness it. They even question why someone would be able to wield such power in editing software.\nIt kind of reminds me of the pre-menu screen in Super Mario 64, in which – perhaps in a bid to show the power of the N64 console – you could stretch and morph Mario's face. It, too, produced some horrifying images that are not of this world.\nThat aside, it does show just how beloved Oblivion in the community, even after 17 years. The Bethesda RPG has definitely aged as time has gone by, but that's where Skyblivion comes into the picture.\nThis is a fan-made project that will be a complete remake of TES4 done in Skyrim's engine. As such, we'll get a much prettier (though perhaps not visually up-to-date) version of Oblivion.

          "description": "Many of us horror fans are giddy about the fact that Silent Hill is making a comeback. However, the loss of P.T. (the SH project that was being developed by Hideo Kojima and Pan's Labyrinth director Guillermo del Toro) will always be a sore point. Not just for fans, either, as even those involved still feel the pain.\nRecently, people on Twitter have acknowledged the nine years that have elapsed since P.T. was released. Many have been reminiscing about what could have been before the game was canceled in 2015. One such person is del Toro himself, who reached out to Konami, seemingly in a bid to see if the studio is interested in reviving the dead project.\nhttps://twitter.com/RealGDT/status/1690528967802167296\nThere's not much that's been said by the director other than asking Konami, \"What sayeth thou?\" This was followed by the phrase \"Irrumabo Konamitus\" which, when translated from Latin to English, says \"I will visit Konami.\"\nDon't let your P.T.s be dreams\nIt sounds like del Toro is very much interested in reviving P.T. \nGiven that Silent Hill is making a triumphant return, hopes will remain that Kojima's take on the series will one day count itself among the many other upcoming SH games. It's hard to say. Konami pretty much turned its back on the franchise (and on Hideo Kojima) several years ago. Whether the studio will ever return to this one particular project cannot be said.\nIt's also hard to imagine it's been nearly ten years since P.T. dropped on PS4 with nary a word. Its photorealistic visuals, Kojima-esque puzzles, and terrifying atmosphere made it stand out. The fact that it was eventually revealed to be a teaser for the now-defunct Silent Hills was even more thrilling.\nSuch a shame it never came to be. Perhaps del Toro's words will open up a new dialogue of possibilities. Ah, to dream.\nThe post Guillermo del Toro reaches out to Konami on P.T.’s ninth anniversary appeared first on Destructoid.",

Before then, we're still being drip-fed bite-sized bits of information, including the story prior to the game itself.\nOver on the developer's website, you can scroll down to a timeline of the major political events that take place before we join things. It begins in the year 2050, when humans take their first steps on Mars.\nJust 50 years later, we begin living in space. Then, after just a few more years, we reach Alpha Centauri, the nearest star system to Earth (about 4.3 light years away from us).\nhttps://twitter.com/StarfieldGame/status/1691105607712202752\nAfter that, the timeline gives a brief rundown of the main events that occur before Starfield kicks off. For example, there's a little bit of information about the United Colonies, the settling of some of the major cities, some wars. All that good stuff.\nWe've truly left Earth behind\nThe timeline ends when Starfield begins. At this point, we can't really say what will happen in the story. All we can safely say is that we'll likely be playing a big part in it. It's also quite optimistic of Bethesda to say that humanity will be able to step on our nearest planet in less than 30 years.

That’s partially because Japan kept most of the good ones and left us with games like Godzilla for NES or Godzilla for PS4. Dai Kaiju Deburas is a unique take on the genre by focusing more on strategy. You don’t play as the monster itself. Instead, you’re the military, and you’re trying to defend an egg while it’s transported across Japan.\nIt’s kind of like 1991’s Godzilla 2: War of the Monsters for NES. However, Dai Kaiju Deburas is less of a chore to play.\nI actually own this game for Famicom, so I’m happy to see it finally get a translation. There’s a decent amount of text that makes it hard to play if you don’t speak English. My Japanese reading skill got me through a few missions, but I wound up putting it aside and never getting back to it. I had planned on playing it for my old Famicom Friday column, but it kind of fell by the wayside. I’ve even got a picture of it on my Mickey TV.

          "description": "I bought my Sega Saturn back when I was in college. Before that, I didn’t know a single person who had ever owned one. It had only been off the market for a decade, but games for it were tough to come by; still are. It sold nearly 10 million units. I have no hard numbers on this, but anecdotally, it seems to have barely made a ripple in Canada. Even knowing that the platform was mostly just popular in Japan, I would think I’d remember a section for Saturn games in Zellers.\nOf the games I was able to sweep up in those early days, I mostly played Virtual On. However, a more absurd game got the second-most slice of my attention, and that was Street Fighter: The Movie. Or, as my roommates called it, Street Fighter: The Movie: The Game.

Before the 2021 Quake remaster by Nightdive Studios, I was actually most familiar with Quake 4, and I really don’t remember that much about it. In 1996, I was into Duke Nukem 3D. And then after that, it was Goldeneye 007. I at least played Quake 2… The N64 version.\nBut after the first Quake was remastered and introduced me to the series, I held off on any more series exploration, anticipating the second one would eventually get the same treatment. My patience paid off, and the Quake II remaster has arrived. Once again, it’s a terrific introduction.\n[caption id=\"attachment_396573\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]\nQuake 2 (PC [Reviewed], PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Switch)\nNightDive Studios,…",

          "description": "Katsuhiro Harada, the director of Tekken 8 and long-time veteran of the series, has responded to what he refers to as \"silly threats.\" In a recent tweet, he hits back at online trolls with a pretty lengthy statement about what harassment leads to.\nIn a recent post on Twitter, Harada decided to give his take on the threats that have been coming his way online. One such example comes from a no-named user who says they will hit the director \"with a Burning Hammer\" (a move used by Tekken wrestler King) if Tekken 8 doesn't feature Eddy Gordo.\nhttps://twitter.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1689456340564111361\nHarada makes it clear that, serious or not, such threats affect he and \"everyone at FGC\" (fighting game community). In a three-point post, he outlines what comments like these leads to. Number one being that security is bumped up, which \"increases operating costs and increases the burden on the players\" who attend.\nMotivation also decreases\nHe goes on to say that \"company founders, board members, and lawyers 'Don't like to be intimidated',\" and that he does not \"adopt the views of those who use 'We' when expressing their opinions,\" as though such people represent all fans.\nThe end result is that studios simply have no motivation to carry on making games when threats are being made. Tekken 8 is highly anticipated, and the last thing fans want or need is for the team to not want to keep working on it.\nYet still people persist. Immediately below Harada's tweet, one user says they will be spending their money elsewhere because companies like Bandai Namco easily forget the \"narrow demographic who, mostly, go out of their way to afford\" a \"luxury product.\" Harada's response to this is a bit more... direct. So, as he's said before, don't ask him for shit.\nThe post Tekken 8 director fires back at ‘silly threats’ over the roster appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Ubisoft has announced that the upcoming Assassin's Creed Mirage has gone gold. Even more surprisingly, the game's release date has shifted up a week, from October 12 to October 5. No explanation was given for the changed release date, though it's unlikely fans are complaining.\nhttps://twitter.com/assassinscreed/status/1691117533846482944\nAssassin's Creed Mirage is supposed to be a smaller, more streamlined Assassin's Creed. Promotional material for the upcoming game, which is centred on Valhalla's Basim, reveals that it returns to the franchise's roots by placing greater focus on parkour and stealth gameplay.\n[caption id=\"attachment_396580\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Ubisoft.[/caption]\nAssassin's Creed Mirage coming sooner than expected\nThe \"gone gold\" announcement simply means that a release version of the game is complete and ready for duplication and shipping. Rather than sit on the game, Ubisoft has decided to release the game earlier. While this does suggest some confidence in the game, it doesn't necessarily mean it won't be getting any post-launch patches.\nOne of the benefits of the new release date is that Mirage gets to launch relatively early in a month which is absolutely stacked with headlining releases. Ubisoft has avoided releasing Mirage on the same week as Forza Motorsport and Lords of the Fallen, though it now shares a release week with Detective Pikachu Returns. Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and Alan Wake 2 are both highly anticipated sequels also scheduled to release in October.\nIn many ways, it feels like Assassin's Creed Mirage is a response to some of the complaints lodged against Valhalla. If it can avoid the open-world bloat that plagued Valhalla while providing a compelling narrative for Basim, Mirage could be the breath of fresh air the franchise needs.\nThe post Assassin’s Creed Mirage is launching a week earlier appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, it appears as though the long-awaited FPS horror game from GSC could be launched at the start of December, even though there's been no official confirmation.\nThat's according to the game's listing on German retail website PLAION, as spotted by ex-VGC writer Andrew Marmo. As of this story going live, it looks as though STALKER 2 may be releasing on December 1. That goes for all platforms, it seems.\nhttps://twitter.com/the_marmolade/status/1690092961772482560\nOf course, the developer hasn't said anything about this, so it's hard to say whether this is accurate information or not. Amazon currently has the game's release date as December 31, which is likely just a placeholder.\nThis sounds a bit familiar\nMaybe some of you are scratching your heads and thinking, \"Wait. Didn't we already get a confirmed launch window?\" Why, yes. Back in January 2022, GSC Game World did post on Twitter to say that STALKER 2 was coming December 8, 2022. Though that was last year, and as you can see, that didn't happen, either.\nAs such, it seems as though the release date is probably going to be December, but temper expectations until we get official word.\nIt's a shame the studio had to push back the upcoming sequel. Much of the delay came from the Russian invasion into Ukraine that begin at the start of 2022, which forced the developer to relocate to Prague.\nAs such, delaying the release of STALKER 2 was expected but understandable, and most fans are happy to wait a little longer. Hopefully, GSC will make an announcement soon around this possible December 1 release date.\nThe post STALKER 2’s release date may have been leaked appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "During the August 8 Pokemon Presents events, there were a few noteworthy announcements and reveals. A new Pokemon animated series called Path to the Peak received some of the spotlight, and the first episode was released on August 11.\nThe series tells the tale of a girl named Ava who finds it difficult to fit in after moving to a new town. Although she gets off to a rocky start, she is quickly able to make friends through the shared hobby of playing Pokemon TCG. Although Path to the Peak isn't a must-watch kind of series, it is a great treat for fans.\n[caption id=\"attachment_396512\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via The Pokemon Company.[/caption]\nAva and the Pokemon TCG Club\nThe social aspects of Pokemon are one of the reasons the franchise found monumental success. By allowing and encouraging players to trade creatures and compete, a vibrant global community has formed. This element of the franchise is reflected in Path to the Peak, though it is focused on card collecting.\nLike most kids who find themselves in a new town, Ava struggles to fit in. In the first episode, we discover how she finds a strange Pikachu origami that leads her to a Pokemon TCG club. At first, she is quickly trounced, but after learning a few tips from her dead, she is able to come out victorious and become a member of the Pokemon club. It seems her greatest battle is still to come because the episode ends with her catching the attention of Celestine, the best player in the school.\nThe cartoon comes at just the right time, as it has been quite an eventful year for Pokemon TCG. This year, the Scarlet and Violet generation of Pokemon TCG kicked off, and the Obsidian Flames set was released on August 11. Fans can also look forward to the Pokemon 151 set that will celebrate the original Kanto creatures.\nThe post Pokémon: Path to the Peak (the TCG cartoon) Episode 1 is out appeared first on Destructoid.",

That's if you're lucky enough to be able to get any of it, of course.\nA recent video on the AMD YouTbe channel introduces a limited edition graphics card and processor themed after the upcoming space-faring RPG. More specifically, it's the Radeon 7900 XTX GPU and the Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPU that have been given the special Starfield makeover.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1KjsqaWIU4\nHowever, there are only 500 of these being made available. You can check out a few more details on AMD's website. To make things even trickier, it appears as though only those who were in attendance at QuakeCon 2023 will be in with a chance of getting hold of the hardware. It doesn't look like they'll be going on sale.\nSo what's the point?\nThis seems like one more way that AMD and Bethesda are cozying up together. A few weeks back, the tech giant announced that it would be giving away a free copy of Starfield with purchases of select graphics cards or CPUs.\nThe game is also being optimized for Team Red's products, due to a partnership between Bethesda and AMD. As such, some Nvidia or Intel users might be feeling a little bit left out.\nWith just a few weeks to go now until release day, Starfield retains its first-class seat on the Hype Train. There's a lot riding on this new IP from the Skyrim and Fallout studio. We can't say for certain how successful the game will be when it comes out. Ah, who are we kidding?

He was proud of the game he and the team at Sabotage had made, but he was prepared to consider it a success even if it didn’t sell well. “If 100 People bought it, I would have been like, ‘Oh my God, we hit three digits. So, for sure, there’s at least one person I don’t know that bought it,’” Boulanger says. The Messenger sold far more than 100 copies and even took home The Game Awards’ Best Debut Indie award alongside many other accolades. With its unique approach to platforming and a fun story twist that allowed it to exist as both an NES and SNES throwback, The Messenger was a hit and quickly allowed Boulanger and Sabotage to pursue its dream project: A large-scale RPG unabashedly inspired by 16-bit greats like Chrono Trigger, Super Mario RPG, and many more. “It’s been seven years, and it’s still kind of a dream,” Boulanger says. Read more...",

Karai is a high-ranking member of the Foot Clan that made her TMNT comics debut in 1992 and has appeared in several animated adaptions. She’s usually depicted as Shredder’s second-in-command but has also been portrayed as his adopted daughter, depending on your choice of Turtles’ lore (perhaps most famously in the 2003 animated series). Despite her allegiance to the Foot, Karai has often been an uneasy ally to the Turtles in the face of mutual threats.\n\n\nDimension Shellshock also features Usagi Yojimbo as the other new playable fighter and will include a new survival mode. Today’s trailer shows off some of the new filters, including a neat black-and-white comic-panel style presentation inspired by the original TMNT books. The DLC also features new music from composer Tee Lopes and alternative color schemes for each character. \nTo learn more about why we think TMNT: Shredder's Revenge is the best Turtles game in decades, read our review here.",

While the results have been hit or miss over the last few years, EA Sports aims to deliver myriad updates to NHL 24 to make it feel more authentic to the real-life game of hockey than ever before.\nIt all revolves around the Exhaust Engine, which is a system that dictates player performance based on stamina while rewarding players for attacking on offense. The new Goalie Fatigue system ensures the goalie isn't as effective on the first shot of a power play as he is on follow-up shots.

Today, Keighley revealed that the long-quiet Crimson Desert will make its presence known in the form of new gameplay footage.\nCrimson Desert was first revealed at The Game Awards in 2020 and comes from Pearl Abyss, the studio behind the popular MMO Black Desert Online. Crimson Desert is a single-player open-world RPG set in the gritty medieval fantasy world of Pywel. This biodiverse continent is inhabited by humans, fantastical races, and mystical beasts and centers on Macduff, a mercenary who assembles a band of comrades to survive an ensuing power struggle of numerous factions vying to take control of the continent. \nNext Tuesday, join us at @gamescom Opening Night Live, to see a brand new look at the gameplay of CRIMSON DESERT (@CrimsonDesert_) from Pearl Abyss.\nhttps://t.co/AFycLZG9XF pic.twitter.com/mEj030uEQN\nAugust 16, 2023\nThe game's presentation and tone have Western fantasy vibes reminiscent of series such as Game of Thrones. Combat consists of fast-paced melee combat (both unarmed and with various weapons) and flashy magic abilities. If you haven’t seen Crimson Desert in action, check out this gameplay overview released around the game’s announcement.\n\n\nCrimson Desert doesn't have a release date, but Pearl Abyss CEO Jin-Young Heo stated earlier this year that the game was targeting a fall 2023 release window. We'll likely find out of that's still the case when Opening Night Live airs on August 22 at 11 a.m. Pacific/2 p.m. Eastern.",

However, that wait has been shortened just a little; today, Ubisoft revealed that the game has gone gold, and since they're done ahead of schedule, it will now come out on October 5th, a week earlier than previously announced.\nAssassin's Creed Mirage has gone gold and is coming out a week early! 📀\n#AssassinsCreed pic.twitter.com/eWAZttvjIX\nAugust 14, 2023\nThe game follows Basim Ibn Ishaq, an Assassin previously introduced as a supporting character in 2020's Assassin's Creed Valhalla. While the series was traditionally about stealth-focused combat in dense cities, more recent entries have put the player into more open-world environments and incorporated RPG mechanics. Mirage is a return to that classic formula of old, complete with the iconic white hood, hidden blade, and parkour. Set in Baghdad, the game takes place 12 years before the events in Valhalla.\nIn an era where it feels like games are constantly being delayed, it's a nice change of pace when a game is moved up instead. Recently, Baldur's Gate 3 moved its PC release up to avoid competing with \"other RPGs,\" which most likely refers to Starfield. Mirage's new date doesn't seem to be motivated by the desire to avoid competition, but it does pull it a little ahead of the other huge games releasing in October, specifically Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and Super Mario Bros. Wonder, which both come out on October 20.\nHow do you feel about developers advancing their release dates? Let us know in the comments!",

While we haven't heard much since then, today's THQ Nordic Digital Showcase gave us a teaser trailer. Unfortunately, we did not get any looks at gameplay or additional information.\nIn the Last Ronin graphic novel storyline, the final surviving member of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is on a quest for revenge in a ruined New York City. Both the trailer and the new synopsis point toward this being the case for the game as well. \"Who is the Last Ronin? In a future, battle-ravaged New York City, a lone surviving Turtle embarks on a seemingly hopeless mission seeking justice for the family he lost. From the minds of the creators of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and based on the best-selling comic book event by Eastman, Waltz, Bishop, Delgado, and the Escorza Brothers: the official video game adaptation of TMNT: The Last Ronin.\"\n\n\nAccording to senior vice president for games and emerging media at Paramount Global in his interview with Polygon back in March, TMNT: The Last Ronin will be a single-player action RPG similar to the modern God of War series. The title will feature a mature tone, which should be exciting for fans of the comic series, but Rosen made it clear back in March that the game was years away from release.\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin doesn't currently have a release window, but is currently slated to come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will we land on it? Let's find out.

The game was first announced in February 2021. \nEver Crisis hits iOS and Android on September 7. The game is a free-to-play single-player chapter-structured RPG that spans the entire FFVII timeline. Expect to relieve key elements of the original 1997 game plus new story elements written by FF VII Remake story and scenario writer Kazushige Nojima that center on a young Sephiroth. Gameplay includes active-time battles, and monetization takes the form of microtransactions for certain weapons and equipment. See it in action in the latest trailer from Summer Game Fest in June.\n\n\nThis will be the latest stab at bringing FFVII content to mobile. In January, Square Enix shut down Final Fantasy VII The First Soldier, its mobile battle royale that was revealed alongside Ever Crisis two years ago. Hopefully, Ever Crisis has a better run and offers a solid appetizer until Final Fantasy VII Rebirth launches next year.",

In Destiny 2, Reddick played Commander Zavala – an important recurring character in Destiny lore. Reddick was also an outspoken fan of the game that engaged with the community often, so recasting his role was always going to be a difficult task.\nToday, Bungie announced that legendary actor Keith David would be taking over the role. David is an accomplished film and television actor appearing in movies like The Thing and TV shows like Community (pictured below).\nHe has also voiced a number of characters in animated films and video games. He played Dr. Facilier in The Princess and the Frog and he played Keith David in Saint's Row IV. Perhaps his most famous video game role, however, is that of The Arbiter in Halo games. David is no stranger to working with Bungie.\nIn the post on Bungie's site announcing the casting, David said, \"I am honored to continue the great work of Lance Reddick as Zavala. Lance captured the character's sense of integrity so wonderfully. It is my intention to continue that work.\"",

After an absolute dearth of new content on the tail end of the original game's lifecycle, Overwatch 2 did little to regain favor with its community, thanks to polarizing changes to the game's structure and the cancellation of the highly anticipated Hero Missions.

          "description": "If you were looking forward to playing the pro-wrestling-themed RPG WrestleQuest today for its launch, it looks like that card was subject to change. The game has suffered a last-minute delay and will now arrive on August 22.\nDeveloper Mega Cat Studios and publisher Skybound Games announced the delay yesterday evening, explaining the cause was due to the discovery of a save glitch. The statement reads,\n“When performing final checks on one of our launch platforms, we discovered it was possible for players to lose their save game progress when playing WrestleQuest on multiple different devices. Because this is a game filled with hours of content and player progress is so important, we could never bodyslam our fans like that.”\nWhile it’s a bummer to see the game get pushed back mere hours before launch, it’s a good thing the team caught this issue before it could affect players. Curious wrestling and RPG fans will have to wait another couple of weeks, but at least they'll presumably be able to play with some peace of mind. \nWrestleQuest unfolds in a world molded after action figure wrestling leagues with protagonist Randy “Muchacho Man” Santos on a quest to become the ultimate superstar. Inspired by classics like Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VI, you’ll partner with a large cast of fellow grapplers to unleash special attacks and tag team moves on your opponents. In addition to fictional personalities, several real-life stars appear in the game, including Jeff Jarrett, Jake “The Snake” Roberts, Sgt. Slaughter, among others.\nWresleQuest will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, PC, and on mobile via Netflix.",

Best of all, you can add one of the most coveted Pokémon from Gen I, Mew, to your party for free right now. Then, you can gear up to challenge the powerful Mewtwo during the aptly named Get Mew And Mewtwo event.\nBeginning now, you can receive Mew as a Mystery Gift in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. To do this, simply go to the Mystery Gift in-game menu while connected to the internet and enter the password \"GETYOURMEW\" before September 18. Each Mew's Tera Type, nature, and moves will be different to reflect the Mythical Pokémon's flexible capabilities. You'll be able to add Mew to your party and continue your adventures around the Paldea region, but you can also participate in the second portion of this event.\nThe second phase of this event kicks off September 1, with Mewtwo appearing in special Tera Raid battles. If you're able to defeat Mewtwo in these Tera Raid battles, you'll be rewarded with the opportunity to catch a Mewtwo with the Mightiest Mark, meaning these will be seven-star Tera Raid battles. The Pokémon Company also teases that if you challenge Mewtwo with Mew, you can expect \"something special.\"\nPokémon Scarlet and Violet will also play host to several other Tera Raid battle events during this time. Wave 1 runs from today until August 17, Wave 2 runs from August 18 until August 31, and then Mewtwo finally arrives from September 1 to September 17.\n\n\nDuring the same Pokémon Presents livestream, we also learned a lot about the upcoming Pokémon Scarlet and Violet expansions. For more on Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, be sure to check out our review. If you're more about the nostalgic side of the Pokémon franchise, this Pokémon Presents had you covered there as well, as Nintendo Switch Online also added two '90s Pokémon spin-offs to its classic game catalog.",

          "description": "Call of Duty Modern Warfare III will be released on November 10, and we got the briefest of teases in a new trailer today. Activision confirmed today’s reveal last week after the game leaked online.\nThe teaser doesn’t provide much to go on except the release date; platforms are unannounced, but we imagine it'll be on the usual suspects. Sledgehammer Games is taking the reins, making it the first Modern Warfare title not made by Infinity Ward (but it's still assisting, as all Call of Duty studios tend to). Sledgehammer's last entry was 2021’s Call of Duty: Vanguard, and it also developed WWII and Advanced Warfare. \n\n\nIn the meantime, be sure to check out our Modern Warfare II review and read how that game and Warzone will continue to get content updates in the form of new celebrity operators such as Snoop Dogg and Nicki Minaj. You can also read about how Sony signed a deal with Microsoft to keep the franchise on PlayStation for the next decade as part of the ongoing Microsoft/Activision acquisition.",

          "description": "Almost exactly one year ago, SNK announced a new Fatal Fury game, the first in over 20 years, was in the works. During EVO this weekend, the company revealed the game’s title is Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, alongside a new teaser trailer.\nThe video shows off some brief in-game footage of staples Terry Bogard and Rock Howard in action. Unfortunately, we don’t see much more than that, and SNK has only promised to share more information at a later date. \n\n\nThe last Fatal Fury game was 1999’s Garou: Mark of the Wolves, so a new entry has been a long time coming for fans. Hopefully, it arrives sooner than later and is another big fighting game to anticipate during a relative boom period for the genre thanks to Street Fighter 6 and the upcoming Mortal Kombat 1 and Tekken 8.

          "description": "Indie publisher Devolver Digital has announced a slew of delays for some of its more anticipated titles on the horizon. Framed through a humorous parody of a Nintendo Direct, Devolver released a \"Devolver Delayed Showcase\" to tell players all about the games they won't be playing in 2023. The showcase highlights five games in particular: The Plucky Squire, Skate Story, Anger Foot, Stick it to the Stickman, and Pepper Grinder.\n\"We have some exciting news about next year,\" one host says. \"This year's delays,\" the other host follows up. \"Some of our brightest upcoming titles are finding their way to 2024!\"\nThe Plucky Squire, a game that bounces between 2D and 3D gameplay, is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Pixel-art platformer Pepper Grinder is currently slated to arrive on Switch and PC. Meanwhile, roguelite brawler Stick it to the Stickman, kickflipping sports-action game Skate Story, and foot-based first-person shooter Anger Foot are currently only listed for PC. \nYou can see the full Devolver Delayed Showcase below.\n\n\nDevolver Digital has had a solid 2023, with titles like Terra Nil receiving positive reviews, fan-favorite Bleak Sword DX making its way to Switch and PC, and new content for Cult of the Lamb, but today's delays are sure to disappoint some. However, by this point in time, many players recognize that it's better to delay a game than to launch it before it's ready, and with Gunbrella and The Talos Principle 2 still slated for 2023, the indie publisher still has seemingly a lot in store for fans before the calendar changes over to 2024.",

After 13 years, that finally changes with a surprise jump to PlayStation 4 and Switch.\nRockstar announced today that Double Eleven Studios is creating these ports, which include the zombie-themed Undead Nightmare expansion in one package. This also means that PlayStation 5 players can experience the game due to PS4 backwards compatibility. While it's unclear if these versions feature any kind of performance or graphical improvements, they do have additional language support for simplified and traditional Chinese, Korean, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, and Latin American Spanish. \n\n\nRed Dead Redemption follows former outlaw John Marston on a quest to track down the remaining members of his old crew, the Van der Linde Gang, in order to save his family. Its prequel, Red Dead Redemption II, arrived in 2018. If you missed out on the original the first time around, you can pick up Red Dead Redemption digitally on PS4 and Switch on August 17 for $49.99. Physical copies hit stores on October 13. To learn more about the game, be sure to read our original reviews for the base game and Undead Nightmare.",

          "description": "Following her announcement as the first all-new character to join the Street Fighter 6 roster by way of DLC, A.K.I. gave fans a taste of what to expect when she is added to the game this fall. During this weekend's Evo 2023 fighting game tournament, we received a host of new announcements, including new characters added to the roster of the upcoming Mortal Kombat 1 and even a surprise TMNT collaboration with Street Fighter 6. However, Capcom didn't stop there, as it gave us the first teaser trailer for its 20th playable character, A.K.I.\nDescribed as \"a manaical poison aficionado,\" A.K.I. certainly seems to fit right in with the long lineage of over-the-top and deranged characters within the Street Fighter universe. You can check out the surprisingly dark teaser trailer for A.K.I. below.\n\n\nWhile we already knew A.K.I. was planned, the teaser comes hot on the heels of the release of Rashid, the first DLC character for Street Fighter 6. Rashid debuted in Street Fighter V, but joined the roster of Street Fighter 6 less than two weeks prior to this teaser. A.K.I. arrives in Street Fighter 6 this fall. Both characters – as well as the two remaining members of Year 1, Ed and Akuma – are included in the Deluxe Edition, Ultimate Edition, or Year 1 Character Pass. Rashid is also currently available for individual purchase for 350 Fighter Coins (approximately $7). Regardless of how you obtain Rashid, you also get his secondary outfit and two additional color options. It stands to reason that A.K.I. will follow a similar release method. \nFor more on Street Fighter 6, check out our glowing review of the game, as well as our cover story. If you're new to the Street Fighter franchise, you can get caught up with our history of the series' first 30 years right here.",

          "description": "Mortal Kombat 1’s roster continues to expand, and the latest trailer reveals a returning staple and two long-lost fighters from the series’ 2000s era: Reptile, Ashrah, and Havik.\nThe lengthy trailer provides a great look at the new looks and abilities of each character as well as their respective roles in the story. Reptile is back in his more human form but can still shapeshift into his natural, intimidating lizard body to devour opponents.  \nFans of 2004’s Mortal Kombat: Deception should be happy to see the returns of Ashrah and Havik. Each made their debut in that game, and neither has appeared in the series since Deception’s follow-up, Mortal Kombat: Armageddon in 2006. Ashrah sports a much different look and moveset but remains a demoness mostly cleansed of her inherent evil. Havik appears to retain his chaotic brand of body-contorting, limb-tearing offense. Sareena has also been confirmed as a new Kameo fighter to fan the flame of 2000s nostalgia. Check out the new trailer and a fresh batch of screenshots below. \n\n\n       \n\nMortal Kombat 1 launches on September 19 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.

In this world – Ziêminal – there's no good and no evil; just monsters and enemies in your way. And if today's Deathbound trailer is anything to go on, they won't go down without a fight. \nCheck out the Deathbound reveal trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, players can freely switch between various heroes of different classes in a party at any time, and they'll need to do so to survive in specific situations. Trialforge Studio calls this a \"Binding System, allowing players to absorb the essence of the fallen warriors found throughout the world.\" Using the collected essence, players can obtain new skills and abilities to transform their playstyle, or they can use it to form a party of heroes they can then switch between. \nBinding also unlocks Morphstrikes, which combines all of a party's power into a devastating blow. \n\n\"The memories and identities of the fallen will be uncovered through Binding as well,\" a press release reads. \"In addition to environment and items, essence will reveal the narrative behind the world of Ziêminal and its inhabitants. Though players must tread carefully when Binding, as not all heroes converge harmoniously. The conflicts caused by divergent essences absorbed will greatly impact the gameplay and narrative alike.\" \nDeathbound is due out sometime in 2024 on Steam.",

The game’s eerie atmosphere and lack of dialogue lend to the game’s enigmatic nature, and multiple endings offer various truths about the threat you face.\n\n\nSomerville launched for Xbox and PC last November to generally warm reviews, though was noted for its rough technical performance, which has since been improved in post-launch updates.

          "description": "Striking Distance Studios, the studio behind last year’s action horror title The Callisto Protocol, has suffered layoffs.\nIt’s been confirmed via IGN that 32 employees have been let go from the studio. These include production coordinator Sebastian Marlow, associate producer Nora Falcon, senior environment artist Matthew Smith, and VFX artist Matt Christopherson. \nA spokesperson for Krafton, Striking Distance’s parent company, gave the following statement to IGN: \n“Striking Distance Studios and Krafton have implemented strategic changes that realign the studio’s priorities to better position its current and future projects for success. Unfortunately, these changes have impacted 32 employees. Honoring the invaluable contributions of each departing team member with material support in the form of outplacement services and meaningful severance packages is our top priority during this difficult moment.”\nStriking Distance was founded in 2019 by Dead Space co-creator Glen Schofield alongside industry veterans. The Callisto Protocol was its first title, released in December 2022. Set in a prison on Jupiter’s moon of Callisto in 2320, it follows an inmate’s escape following an alien outbreak. The game received a mixed reception from critics and players; we scored it a 6 out of 10 in our review. It was reported in January that The Callisto Protocol underperformed in sales compared to its reportedly massive budget. \nThe Callisto Protocol’s story expansion, Final Transmission, was released on June 28.  \n[Source: IGN]",

However, if you’ve been paying attention to the Call of Duty space, it’s no surprise that this year’s Call of Duty is Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. It’s leaked in various ways already, including on special Monster energy drink packaging (thanks, CharlieIntel). \nJokes on you, real key art here.\npic.twitter.com/UCCexH7IMr\nAugust 2, 2023\nAs you can see, the official Call of Duty Twitter account says, “We’ll share our artistic abilities and even more next week,” alongside fake key art poking fun at redacted Modern Warfare III information leaking ahead of its official reveal. This aligns with a recent Modern Warfare II Season 5 blog post, which announced that the next Call of Duty would be revealed in-game through a “special event.” \nIt seems that reveal is happening next week, although when or how remains unclear. Interestingly, the reveal of a new Call of Duty releasing this year contrasts with reports from early last year stating Call of Duty would skip 2023. \nIn the meantime, read how Lara Croft, Nicki Minaj, Snoop Dogg, and 21 Savage are coming to Modern Warfare II and Warzone, and then read Game Informer’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II review. Check out this story about how Sony signed a 10-year agreement with Microsoft to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation after that. \nAre you excited for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III?

Thank you to those who submitted bug reports about this, and if you still locate a version that is not recognised, please report it to us (beware that the frankenstein versions that are floating around the internet will not be accepted, only those copied from the original media).\nFor the full and comprehensive list of notable changes, please refer to the Release Notes.\nIf you are as excited about the release as we are, you can share our joy by downloading it from our downloads page.
