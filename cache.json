          "description": "Home sweet home.\nMost horror game fans will recognize the cult classic series Clock Tower as a PlayStation-exclusive franchise. The first game in the series to ever come to the West was on the original PlayStation, but a few years prior in 1995, the series started off on the Super Famicom in Japan as a point-and-click horror adventure. This original Clock Tower never made it to the West officially and has been quite the curiosity for many. However, that curiosity will soon be piqued yet again as Limited Run Games just revealed a collaboration with WayForward and Sunsoft to bring this darling thriller to Nintendo Switch.\nThis enhanced version of the sprite-based, scissor-tormented horror title is being officially translated in English (and more) for the first time, accompanied by a new animated opening by WayForward, motion comic cutscenes at the start and end of the game, and a new vocal theme song Mary McGlynn, famous for her work on the Silent Hill series\nClock Tower is currently slated for release sometime in early 2024. A price is yet to be determined, but Limited Run have confirmed that a digital and physical release are both in the works.\n\nWere you aware of this Japan-exclusive horror title? Have you been waiting ages to give this game a slice of your time? Let us know your thoughts down below.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Though it’s clear that this remake has been built on the foundation of a simple game released for the original PlayStation, Gust has nonetheless done a stellar job in modernizing its more antiquated components while enhancing its strongest features.

This week, I ask you to pick between risky destruction and precise construction. What's better: breech-loading grenade launchers, or creating construction blueprints?\nRead more",

As we searched for a rumoured cure that would save what's left of humanity back in the depths of space, would we be ping-ponging from perilous rooftop to perilous turbine pad unaided as we bobbed along the nauseous expanse below? Or would it be a more guided affair, with forgotten text logs and computer terminals nudging us toward tailored waypoints? \nHaving now played its recently-released early access version, the answer is a mix of both, with the freedom to scavenge and craft new modules for your burgeoning airship at your leisure while a handy radar points you in the direction of its critical story path. Assuming you've found a busted one to research and 3D print yourself, of course. The tools you need to survive don't come easily in this strangely picturesque wasteland, but they're also not so hard to track down that you ever feel truly threatened by the minutiae of staying alive. It's a pleasant mix for casual survival toe dippers like myself right now, but the dramatic climax of its first major story chunk suggests this is but a brief calm before the eventual storm.\nRead more",

          "description": "I remember playing the first Oxenfree so clearly. The nervousness of not truly understating the supernatural forces its cast of troubled teens was up against, the heightened tension of uncovering the buried secrets of Edwards Island, and - what I loved the most - the finely tuned undercurrent of dread that quietly crept through the game. It conjured a sense of unease in me that I couldn't shake loose, and it was a feeling that clung to me throughout my entire playthrough.\nSo I was pretty stoked when Night School Studio announced Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals, a direct follow-up set five years after the original game. Lost Signals may take place in a new location with a new cast of characters, but there's still a lot of overlap. There are supernatural spooks, personal character drama, creepy radio equipment, and those good ol' screen glitches that I've missed so much. But with all these tethers to the first game, Lost Signals feels like a re-tread of the same ground. It's still a good sequel, I should add, but it's not a particularly satisfying one.\nRead more",

Either way, I’ve found myself on a bit of Metal Gear kick recently. Phantom Pain, for all its narrative faults, holds up still as a cracking stealth sandbox rivalled only by Hitman. And MGS1 is still dramatic, still goofy, still alternately comedically overwrought and genuinely touching.

Thankfully, Amazon Prime Day has your back, offering some pretty tasty discounts on the Samsung Pro Plus in its 256GB and 512GB varieties.\r\n\nOur James reckons these specific cards are the best fit for Valve's chunky handheld, and I agree. As usual I took his advice and ended up with the 512GB card that has served me well over the last 12 months. Although the 256GB model might be enough if you're planning to stuff it full of games with a smaller footprint (such as the excellent Pizza Tower, Vampire Survivors or many other of the Steam Deck's best games), I'd recommend the 512GB card if you're leaning towards beefier titles.\n\n Read more",

In Divinity: Original Sin II, they provided the impossible - making each companion character a playable protagonist, and weaving their unique plotlines into the tapestry of the main story. It was one of the RPG’s great innovations - handing you a killer backstory, a tangible motivation, and a set of prompts for how you might go about roleplaying your exiled lizard prince or demon-possessed musician. For those of us who struggle with the blank page of character creation, it was a godsend (quite literally, since the adventure concerned your ascension).\nChoosing a set character came with an obvious drawback, however. It robbed you of the chance to make the most of Larian’s character creation tools, fiddling with freckles and tattoos and biceps until you had an alter ego entirely your own. With Baldur's Gate 3, Larian have threaded the needle, conceiving an origin character who looks, sounds and fights however you like, yet enters the game with a frankly frightening amount of personal history and suspiciously lumpy baggage - and as they announced during the final Panel from Hell last week, some of that baggage will be soaked in blood. Optionally available as one of seven starting personalities, the Dark Urge is a mass murderer. Their species, gender, class and eyebrow thickness are up to you, but what you can’t change is their deep and insatiable need to kill for pleasure.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "If you've put up with a clunky clicker for too long, now's the time to pull the trigger, or in this case, press down with enough force to add the HyperX Pulsefire Haste to your basket. It's got a hefty 50% discount for Amazon Prime Day, the biggest discount since last year's Black Friday. Can I vouch for it? Yes, I have one! It's light and accurate and does a very good job of skating across my mat like a perfectly tuned puck.\nThe HyperX Pulsefire Haste is a cracking option if you're after a no-nonsense gaming mouse that'll stand you in good stead for anything, really. MOBAs, ARPGs, the likes of CS:GO, all handled brilliantly by the Pixart 3335 sensor. Its honeycomb shell also means it's really light, with an ambidextrous body suited to lefties or righties alike. I wouldn't say the included grip tape is all that useful, mind. Mine sort of peeled off, but I've had no qualms popping my thumbs and fingers on its plastic body.\n\n Read more",

I’d be lying if I said this wasn’t an unfamiliar use of the tech – normally I just use liveblogs to relay game announcements or make fun of Geoff Keighley’s clothes. \nThere is, however, a lick of sense behind it. Sifting through the hundreds, if not thousands of discounted gaming wares is a time-hungry process – just ask Ed and Liam, who I’ve shandhaied into helping this year – and the main Prime Day PC gaming deals hub, the Prime Day graphics card deals hub, and the Prime Day Steam Deck accessories deals hub all tend to get larger but less frequent updates. To say nothing of the Anti-Prime Day deals guide, which also highlights savings on quality hardware from non-Amazon sellers. Keep an eye on this liveblog, though, and we’ll point out the really great stuff more or less as soon as we find it.\nRead more",

Mars First Logistics is a game about designing little moon rover buggies to pick things up and drive them to somewhere else.\nIf you looked at it and went \"ooh\", your coo lobe was right. \"Design a vehicle\" games are often too fiddly and/or competition-oriented for me, and trucking games too businesslike and grounded. This threads the needle beautifully. It's challenging, but gently, prioritising an approachable design and smooth controls without sacrificing the satisfaction of solving a decent engineering puzzle. It's even pretty, so that even plain driving back and forth is pleasant and rewarding.\nRead more",

Oh, and the deadly brolly, of course. I mean, it’s a gunbrella. What else is there to say?\nThe demo I played at PAX is now available to download and play on Steam, and I highly recommend it. Even if you’re a bit like me and Metriodvanias aren’t really your thing, the hour-long demo is entirely linear, and messing around with the gunbrella's many, many abilities is more than a good enough reason to have a play, even if you're just mucking around.\nRead more",

This month's game has been chosen by yours truly and I'm very much in the mood to revisit a comfy, cosy puzzle game so I've chosen Unpacking. Cue the confetti!\nUnpacking is a puzzle game that's all about pulling your homewares and personal items out of cardboard moving boxes and placing them in a new home. It's best described as a relaxing house moving sim but it's also a sort of block-fitting puzzle game. Finding the perfect spot for each item is largely down to your own personal taste, but there are some loose 'room rules' (no, you cannot put your toaster in the bedroom for some midnight cheese toastie action). If you like organising games - A Little To The Left, Sticky Business, Wilmot's Warehouse and the like - then Unpacking is the game for you.\nRead more",

He spent a full three minutes surveying the pockmarked, potentially lethal landscape from above with a drone, marking the most dangerous terrain in advance and picking out a relatively safe route between the checkpoints. “Alright,” he thought. “I’m going to smash this stage.”\r\n\n\r\nOf course, it’s just as they say: no plan survives contact with unroaded planets wracked by extreme temperatures, meteor showers and atmospheric pressure unlike anything ever experienced on Earth. On the corner of the first checkpoint, Lindsay flipped his rover, snagging the vehicle on a rock that immediately broke his scanning systems and left him driving blind. By the time of our chat, though, he’s laughing. Exo Rally Championship is a racer for those who like to roll with the punches, quite literally - an anecdote generator for players who adore the challenge of preparing for the worst, and then adapting to changing circumstances on the fly.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Players will be able to go head to head with two of the game's four factions - the golden fantasy knights of the Stormcast Eternals and the sneaky green stink lads of the Orruk Kruleboyz - giving us our first taste of how they'll handle in battle, and the kinds of powerplays we'll be making with their respective (and rather handsome) tabletop miniature recreations. \nAnd having played four rounds of its 1v1 matches already at a press event last week, it's quite the thrill - and I say that as someone with no real attachment to Warhammer or Age Of Sigmar's specific lore legacy. The Stormcast Eternals and their flying hammer brutes are just as devastating as you'd imagine, while the lads lads lads and their Killaboss Kruleboyz are challenging late-game bloomers that will give even hardened strategy game veterans plenty to sink their teeth into. Both factions are great fun, and I'm very much looking forward to jumping back in this weekend.\nRead more",

          "description": "Thrilling as it may be to swing a lightsaber or shoot a headcrab in stereoscopic 3D, the VR experiences I crave most are those which use the tech to fold my brain into entirely new shapes. 2019's A Fisherman's Tale was one of those. An unassuming first-person puzzler about a puppet fisherman living in a lighthouse, it dazzled with its incredible deployment of VR's unique sense of perspective and scale. It's the kind of game that, if it featured a psychotic AI and some cake memes instead of a beard in a yellow anorak, would have been heralded as a revolution in play.\r\n\n\r\nIt would have been easy to follow-up A Fisherman's Tale in the same way, make a bigger game with a few new gimmicks and a comedy lobster voiced by Stephen Merchant. But that isn't what developer InnerspaceVR has done. Instead, Another Fisherman's Tale bends your neural pathways in entirely new forms, offering a completely different kind of puzzling. The results are equally innovative and almost as interactively satisfying - although a lack of refinement in the latter category is a deflating puncture in the game's dinghy.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Přestože je právě léto, Virtuální Bastlírna je tu opět jako každý měsíc. Technici a vědci nic jako prázdniny nebo okurkovou sezónu zřejmě neznají! Důkazem budiž, že témat, která strahovské bastlíře tento měsíc zaujala, je více než za květen a červen dohromady. Ze žhavých novinek můžou zmínit nový DAQ nástroj Analog Discovery 3. Ohledně RP 2040 se dělo více věcí - podpora Bluetooth pro RPi Pico W, bootloader startující program z SD karty, BASIC nebo třeba bezdrátovou páječku od MiniWare. Rozhodně ale nelpí na jednom procesoru - Arduino Uno R4 bude v sobě mít ESP32-S3 a vyšlo i nové ESP32-P4.\r\n\r\nZe softwarového světa můžou bastlíři ukázat LoraWAN senzor na odečet vodoměrů s kamerou, jak se hackuje chytrý zubní kartáček, novinky v PrusaSliceru nebo KVM pro desktopy založené na Rpi CM4, opensource kalkulačku s reverzní polskou notací a výpočty nejistot nebo novo verzi KiCADu.\r\n\r\nZa hardware pak strahováci shrnou novinky, které jim přistály v poště - NanoVNA-H4, TinyPFA, TinySA Ultra, generátor pulzů a GPSDO od Leo Bodnara (a opravený SW pro něj). Pak ukázky bastlení - sondy magnetického pole, dokonce několik iterací a jak s nimi hledat problematické zdroje vyzařování a jak se dá postavit Rogowského cívka včetně zesilovače. Možná i ukáží jak minimalizovat rušení z izolovaných měničů, jak minimalizovat šum na napájení nebo jak se krásně měří s DMM6500 od Keithley.\r\n\r\nAť už vás zaujalo cokoliv z nabízených témat nebo chcete ukázat nějaký svůj bastl, dorazte! Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve čtvrtek 13. července od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

In this article is a wide range of CPU benchmarks putting the Z1 Extreme up against the new Ryzen 7 7840U laptop SoC as well as prior generation Ryzen 7 PRO 6850U for reference. When adjusting the ACPI Platform Profile configuration, the Ryzen Z1 Extreme proves to be very robust from a low-power SoC delivering good battery performance up through pulling 50+ Watts while outperforming the 7840U.",

          "description": "A little tongue now, a lot of tail later (What!?)\nAs part of the Limited Run Games Showcase stream, the physical publisher announced that they’re resurrecting the GEX series as in the GEX Trilogy. Wow. Oh no.\nLike a few of their surprise game announcements, there wasn’t much to go on from the trailer they showed. If I’m not mistaken, the James Bond parody was a promo for the third game way back in the day. Or maybe it was the second. That lizard really liked parodying characters who were cooler than him. However, the trailer does reveal that the GEX Trilogy will be coming to most current platforms via the Carbon Engine.\nhttps://youtu.be/HhXZZsEfRgk\nSo, Timothy “Toothpick-Fingers” Monbleau and I immediately started venting our shared trauma with this announcement. He played a lot of the first game on the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, while I, as a kid, spent way too much time playing GEX 64. None of the three games included in the trilogy are terrible, honestly. If anything, the most grating part about it is listening to the eponymous gecko spit one-liners that I didn’t really understand at the time. The first game is a sidescroller, whereas the two that followed are collect-a-thon platformers.\nAnyway, any port of these games is a net gain. I’ll be honest, I will probably pick up a digital copy of the GEX Trilogy. I already own all three of these games (the first on Saturn, the other two on N64), but I’m willing to shell out to have them in one place and support the endeavors of kusoge preservation.\nGEX Trilogy is coming to Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, Switch, and PC at some point in the future.\nThe post The legendary GEX Trilogy is coming to modern platforms appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Nice do\nAs part of the Limited Run Games showcase, the boutique publisher announced a number of retro games that are getting modern ports. Among them is Tomba, the 1998 (1997 if you count the Japanese release) platformer by legendary developer Tokuro Fujiwara.\nTomba is a game about the eponymous and fabulous pink-haired caveman. It’s a rather ambitious gated exploration platformer for the PS1 platform that got a sequel, but not nearly enough love. I was actually introduced to it through the passionate rantings of Destructoid alumni James Stephanie Sterling. Original PS1 copies go for mad dough on the collector’s market, but I think seeing one in person might have me making my wallet cry.\nHowever, it’s not necessary for you to make your wallet cry. Instead, Limited Run Games is bringing Tomba to modern platforms. That’s about all the information we have right now. The trailer shown during the stream was just a cutscene. A Tweet following the stream clarified that it will be coming to us with the help of the proprietary Carbon Engine, and will have physical and digital versions.\nhttps://twitter.com/LimitedRunGames/status/1679227783149486082?s=20\nGood enough! I’m just happy that Limited Run Games is whole hogging it with retro revivals. Game preservation has been a topic that I’ve been pounding on for a while now, and I’m happy to see another company take a leap with it. Limited Run Games has had a history with preservation, but it seems like they’re really doubling down on it!\nTomba will be coming to PS4, PS5, Switch, and PC eventually.

As someone who loves SNES games and grew up on fan translations through the 2000s, I am all for this trend.

In a tweet that has since been deleted, an ad from Brazilian gift card retailer PICPAY indicated Diablo 4 was on Xbox Game Pass.\n\"Available now. Get it now or play it through Xbox Game Pass\" the advertisement allegedly read. Ybarra didn't mince words when responding to the claim, stating \"This is not happening.\"\nhttps://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1678564200581595137\nThis isn't the first time Blizzard has addressed the possibility of Diablo 4 on Xbox Game Pass. Back in May, Executive Producer Rod Fergusson tweeted \"We've been getting some questions about D4 on Game Pass and I want to let you know we have no plans for that.\" Although it seems like a popular request for the action-RPG to be part of the membership, it doesn't appear that will happen any time soon.\nMaybe other Blizzard games will hit Game Pass\nI know it's hard to even imagine Diablo 4 on Xbox Game Pass. But with recent legal developments, it may not be a strange thought for long. After all, Bethesda's first brand new IP in a long time, Starfield, will launch on Game Pass day 1.\nWe may see not-so-new Blizzard titles eventually make their way to the pass. Perhaps even the older iterations of Diablo like Diablo III. We'll have to see which Blizzard IP finds its way to the subscription service first.\nFor now, though, it looks like Diablo 4 will continue to have a full-price barrier to entry.

          "description": "The founding of the Ketsuyama Bakufu\nToplitz has announced Sengoku Dynasty, the Japan-centric follow-up to Render Cube’s 2021 survival crafting game, Medieval Dynasty.\nSengoku Dynasty is a bit of a cross between a typical survival game and a survival city builder like Banished. Considering how popular both genres have been in the market, it’s not surprising that they crossed eventually. Rather than just try to stay alive in the wilderness alone or with friends, you build up a settlement for NPCs and try to help them survive.\nMedieval Dynasty first launched into Early Access in 2020, and was pretty janky at the time. Throughout its Early Access period and afterward, Render Cube worked with the community to sort out all the problems, and now it’s a bit of a beloved fixture.\nSengoku Dynasty transplants that gameplay to feudal Japan. It uses Unreal Engine 5 to replicate the Japanese countryside, offering mountains, cherry groves, and hot springs.\nhttps://youtu.be/3y6YQpU_jck\nIt’s looking pretty cool. I didn’t play Medieval Dynasty, because I always feel like these games are meant for being played with friends, and I don’t have those. That’s probably not the case for these games. Still, I think the injection of Sengoku-era Japan is just what I needed to grab my attention and get me over my insecurities.

Play the laundry list of games you already have?! Pah! How about something else to keep you occupied for the next couple of months? If you're a stickler for a deep dive into upcoming games, one fan of the upcoming Bethesda RPG may have what you're looking for.\nOver on Reddit, user Gokamo has been busy putting a document together that contains as much information on Starfield as possible. Recently, they updated the compendium, which is now over 1,000 pages long. The 86,000-word analysis is a huge one-stop place for all the details about the game you could possibly want. You can check it out on Google Docs.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/14vs3r2/added_over_600_new_pages_from_the_direct_leading/\nGokamo uploaded the first iteration of their \"Complete Starfield Compendium\" a year ago. At that point, it was a mere 120 pages. Evidently, they've been beavering away on the dossier ever since, and at 1,070 pages in total, it's a visual testament to their dedication.\nWhat's in it?\nIt's a staggering amount of information to skim. In a nutshell, it's an attempt to detail as much about Starfield as we currently have knowledge on. This includes screenshots, an exploration into the game itself, a deep dive into the reveal footage, concept art, information on skills and character creation, and so much more!\nGokamo says they managed to increase the document by 600 pages in a month due to the recent stream. But even at this point, they seem quite sure that there's some stuff they forgot to include. As user IIIR1PPERIII notes, in a modern gaming era in which strategy guides are becoming a lost art form, this compendium is certainly something that will keep many of you busy up until (and possibly after) Starfield launches.\nThe post This 1,000-page Starfield compendium should keep you busy until September appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Hope you need some new hardware\nRecently, we reported that Starfield was being optimized for AMD. Now, it looks as though Team Red is really digging its heels in by offering the game for free with select CPUs and GPUs. If you need some new gaming tech, hopefully you're an AMD fan.\nIn a new promotion, anyone who purchases an RX graphics card and/or Ryzen processor will recieve Starfield for free. The specifics are over on the AMD website, but it does provide plenty of options to choose from if you're interested. You can find a full list of participating retailers here.\nAs you may expect, the tech giant wants to specifically push its latest generation of products. You can get Starfield with a Ryzen 5 or Ryzen 7, or one of the selected 6000 GPUs. However, if you want the premium edition of the upcoming Bethesda RPG, AMD wants you to consider an RDNA 3 card or Ryzen 9 CPU.\nhttps://twitter.com/amdradeon/status/1678755039865716743\nWhat to expect from Starfield's PC specs\nAMD also makes recommendations for what your system needs to run Starfield on PC. It's a triple-A title, so it will test most mid-range rigs.\nRunning the game at 1080 should require no more than a Ryzen 5 7600 on a Radeon RX 7600 (with an AMD A620 as the recommended motherboard, no less). But if you want that sweet 4K experience, you'll need to part ways with a lot more cash. Fortunately, it doesn't look like you'll need a ninth generation Ryzen, but you'll need the RX 7900 XT, which is a good $900.\nThere's been no mention of what you'll need if you're using Nvidia or Intel hardware. That said, you may be able to extrapolate based on what Team Red is suggesting. It does seem like a lot of investment to get a free game, but deals like this are not uncommon. In fact, it wasn't that long ago that AMD was giving away Resident Evil 4 with RDNA 3 graphics cards.\nStarfield will launch on PC and Xbox Series X|S on September 6.\nThe post Get Starfield for free on PC by cozying up to AMD appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A mix of mobile nostalgia and addiction\nCast your minds back to 2013 and you'll probably be able to recall memories of the phenomenon that was Flappy Bird. For those who don't remember, it was a mobile game that became an unbelievable (if brief) success, possibly one of the most popular iOS and Android releases of its time. Well, now it's back. Kind of.\nGitHub user somhi (via Time Extension) has managed to bring Flappy Bird back from the dead. In this instance, it's been ported to the likes of the Analogue Pocket, so the game is once again playable on mobile devices, just not one that many people are aware of.\n[caption id=\"attachment_391327\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"] Image via Analogue.[/caption]\nThe Analogue Pocket was released in December 2021. Essentially, it's a handheld gaming system that allows you to play Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance titles. No emulation, either. This thing uses the actual cartridges from the OG devices. It's described as the \"ultimate tribute to portable gaming\" and there are optional adapters for the Game Gear, Neo Geo Pocket, and Atari Lynx. Check out our review of it here.\nWhat happened to Flappy Bird anyway?\nGiven the enormous success of Flappy Bird in such a short span of time, it's a wonder it didn't last much longer. However, it was reported that its creator Dong Nguyen felt guilty about the addictive nature of the game. Although he was raking in around $50,000 a day from ad revenues and sales, Nguyen decided to remove the app from both the Apple and Google stores in February 2014.\nThere was a version of it released for Amazon Fire TV in August of that year, but for all intents and purposes, Flappy Bird has been dead for almost a decade. If you do miss its simplistic gameplay mechanics and that rush of dopamine, you can always check out somhi's port for the Analogue Pocket, if you have one, that is. Who knows, maybe other versions will come out off the back of this.\nThe post Flappy Bird (sort of) makes a return after ten years appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "I'm more of a Typhoon Gal fan\nAs part of yesterday’s ID@Xbox Showcase, Digital Eclipse rolled back the rug to reveal The Making of Karateka. This will be an interactive documentary on the 1984 brawler by Prince of Persia designer Jordan Mechner.\nDestructoid’s own Steven “Chunkahunk” Mills covered this as part of his recap on the ID@Xbox Showcase, but I think The Making of Karateka deserves a second look. First released on the Apple II, Karateka made its way to just about every microcomputer under the sun. It was one of the earliest brawlers, made using rotoscoped graphics to create detailed animations rarely seen on early platforms.\n[caption id=\"attachment_391339\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Digital Eclipse[/caption]\nSimilar to Digital Eclipse’s work on Atari 50, The Making of Karateka will include multiple versions, never-before-seen prototypes, and a brand-new remake of the game. This is alongside developer commentary and behind-the-scenes looks at development. On top of all those things, Digital Eclipse is also providing Deathbounce: Rebounded, a dual-stick shooter based on an unfinished prototype by Jordan Mechner.\nDamn! By my calculation, that is everything, including all kitchen appliances and fixtures.\nBetter yet, The Making of Karateka is just the starting point for Digital Eclipse’s Gold Masters Series. What old favorites would you like to see getting this lavish treatment? Pit-Fighter? King of Kings? Ganso Saiyuuki Super Monkey Daibouken!?\nWhile the showcase only announced that The Making of Karateka was coming to Xbox Series X|S, Digital Eclipse has confirmed it is also coming to Switch, PS4, PS5, and PC. The current release date is just “this summer,” but there aren’t that many months left of the season, so we should be seeing it soon.\nThe post Karateka is getting an interactive documentary from Digital Eclipse appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Time to return to Return to Castle Wolfenstein\nIt's not uncommon for older games to be given a modern facelift. Case in point: the original Half-Life recently got a ray tracing mod, and the new lighting makes the aged FPS look pretty spiffing. Now it's Return to Castle Wolfenstein's time to shine, thanks to an upcoming modification for the 22-year-old title.\nAs spotted by DSO Gaming, graphics engineer and Twitter user Dihara Wijetunga is currently working on a project that will see the lighting for the 2001 Wolfenstein entry be given a boost. In a recent tweet, the modder uploaded a brief clip from the game showing the path tracing technology that's being implemented.\nhttps://twitter.com/diharaw94/status/1677846492638224385\nThose familiar with the original game will see the difference, with bolder light and sharper shadows really giving the titular castle a gloomy look. For those who don't quite see it, Wijetunga's clip handily gives a side-by-side comparison, so you can see how RtCW used to look, and how it will look once the mod releases.\nWhen is Return to Castle Wolfenstein with path tracing coming out?\nThere doesn't appear to be a release date for it yet, but it's worth keeping an eye on Wijetunga's GitHub portfolio. If nothing else, you can check out their other work while you wait for the mod.\nAccording to the report from DSO Gaming, path tracing for Return to Castle Wolfenstein will not be using Nvidia's new RTX Remix software. Instead, the upcoming modification will be native to the game.\nSo far, what Wijetunga has done is pretty impressive. It kind of gives you a good sense of just how far video game technology has advanced over the years. It may be more than 20 years old at this point, but RtCW is something of a classic, so it'll be nice to replay it with some visual oomph.\nThe post Here’s a quick peek at Return to Castle Wolfenstein with path tracing appeared first on Destructoid.",

It launched in early access back in 2020. It bills itself as a love letter to H.P. Lovecraft and Uzumaki mangaka Junji Ito. It is very “legally distinct” from Junji Ito’s style. Like, this game was developed because no one else was making a Junji Ito game and the developer got tired of waiting, so they made their own. It’s sort of a visual horror RPG.\n[caption id=\"attachment_391230\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Fangamer[/caption]\nThe physical version being offered by Fangamer is mercifully subdued. I don’t need more giant boxes full of merchandise I don’t use. World of Horror just comes with an instruction manual with an art card. It’s set to ship out October 19, 2023, the same day that it comes out of early access and releases on Switch.\nI used to buy a lot from Fangamer back in the day, back when they sold “legally distinct” video game merchandise. I still wear T-shirts I bought from them more than ten years ago. Then the Canadian loonie lost parity with the greenback, so I only buy sporadically now. They’ve gone all legitimate with real licensing, though. I’m so proud of them.\nYou can currently get World of Horror in its Early Access state on PC. It will be releasing fully on PC and Switch on October 19, 2023. That’s the same day that the physical version will release, but you can preorder now.\nThe post World of Horror is getting the physical treatment on Switch appeared first on Destructoid.",

During the event, Capcom revealed its roadmap for the first three seasons of Exoprimal that includes upcoming content over the next few months. Perhaps the most exciting reveal is two separate crossover events with popular Capcom titles: Street Fighter 6 and Monster Hunter.\n[caption id=\"attachment_391178\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Capcom/YouTube[/caption]\nMonths of content is already in the pipeline for Exoprimal\nSeason 1 will kick off two weeks after release, and Exoprimal will receive its first update with an all new PvE mode: Savage Gauntlet. This mode will rotate tough weekly missions giving players a chance to test out their best loadouts in end-game missions. Rounding out Season 1 is ten new Alpha variant exosuits wielding unique weapons. This update will release on August 16.\nIn mid-October, Season 2 will add new missions, the Ocean Platform map, and even more exosuits. Street Fighter fans should look forward to Season 2 as it will feature a SF6 crossover collaboration. As part of the crossover, we will get new exosuits based on Ryu and Guile.\nFinally, Season 3 will drop early next year featuring even more exosuits, a new Neo Triceratops boss fight, and a Monster Hunter crossover event.  No precise details were provided for this crossover, but we can assume there will be some new giant monsters from the Monster Hunter universe for us to beat up on.\nThose looking to save the world from dinosaurs can do so soon. Exoprimal releases on July 14 on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. PC and Xbox players can check out the game for free as part of Xbox Game Pass.

That's right, you get LEGO Half-Life 2. If you ever wondered what it'd be like to take on the Combine or seek the Vortigaunt's help as one of the Danish company's little plastic figures, wonder no more.\nThe mod is available on the Steam workshop (thanks, PCGamesN) and comes from user Not Dave or Daniel. It's described as a \"full conversion\" project that basically swaps out major Half-Life 2 characters for LEGO figurines. It seems the modder is aiming to eventually replace all the characters in the game, but the images so far show that a few have already been done.\n[caption id=\"attachment_391138\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"] Image via Not Dave or Daniel/Steam.[/caption]\nFans of HL2 will recognize the LEGO facsimiles of Dr. Kleiner, Alyx Vance, Father Grigori, and even the mute protagonist himself, Gordon Freeman. The mod is available to download for free now, and it sounds like there are going to be some updates in the future.\nSo are we gonna talk about..?\nLook, it's nearly impossible to talk about Half-Life without mentioning the whereabouts of the long-awaited third entry. It's been 16 years since Episode Two, and it's safe to assume that a new game in the series is not happening. In fact, back in 2017, ex-Valve writer Marc Laidlaw basically gave away what was likely to be the plot of Half-Life 3, perhaps in an attempt to appease fans who were still waiting.\nIt's just not coming.

The result is a resounding ‘yes’ with 91 voting to form a union and 26 voting against it. The vote now just needs to be certified by the National Labor Relations Board.\nThis vote creates the largest union in the video game industry. It will cover Sega of America’s Irvine, California branch and more than 200 roles. This comes as part of a continued and long-overdue push by workers in the industry to unionize for better treatment. Just this past January, Zenimax QA workers voted to unite.\nhttps://twitter.com/takesAEGIS/status/1678481056520101889?s=20\nSega is largely a Japanese corporation, but like many publishers, they have offices all over the world. This past February, Sega of Japan actually gave its employees a 30% salary increase, but Sega of America didn’t follow suit. AEGIS has stated that its goals are for pay to meet inflation and for better staffing to prevent overworking.\nI’m somewhat surprised that the idea of unionizing has taken this long to catch on in the industry. We’re nearly two decades on from the “EA Spouse” blog that exposed some of the horrible practices of the industry. This mostly involved unpaid overtime, but even after successful lawsuits, crunch remains a commonly used practice across the industry. However, because this is an industry that often attracts individuals and takes advantage of their passion, many workers are afraid to put their job on the line in an attempt to unionize.\nHere’s hoping that this trend continues and we see more stories like this over the next few years.\nThe post Sega of America employees win union vote appeared first on Destructoid.",

It looks like Nintendo is shaking up the formula quite a bit, and a new brief video tutorial showcases just how that's going to play out in the main fourth entry.\nSaid video tutorial covers the following game mechanics:\nGathering up your Pikmin (which is still done through an area-of-effect whistle)\nOrdering Pikmin to build (chucking them at stuff)\nFighting enemies with Pikmin (chucking them at enemies)\nWhat different types of Pikmin do, as well as the Oatchi\nThe latter bit is arguably the most important! It reminds everyone that the red Pikmin type is \"strong and resistant to fire,\" blue Pikmin can breathe underwater, yellow Pikmin can conduct electricity [and can be thrown farther], and so on. Rock, ice, and winged Pikmin are also briefly shown off at the tail-end, with no details. But we know that rock-type Pikmin can deal crucial damage in combat (and can break certain walls), ice Pikmin can freeze enemies and bodies of water, and winged Pikmin can fly/carry objects places some Pikmin can't reach.\nOf course, the Nintendo would be remiss to not mention the new Oatchi (dog) mechanic, which is briefly shown at the end. This is arguably the biggest mixup the series has offered to date, and the demo alone offers a ton of strategic possibilities for the concept. You can put this video training to good use when Pikmin 4 launches on July 21, 2023 on Switch.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HERRRVpEX3o\nThe post This Pikmin 4 video tutorial is a nice refresher for how the series works appeared first on Destructoid.",

Perhaps one of the biggest offenders is Denuvo, which is said to be a major factor in reducing game performance, especially on PC. It's become so controversial that studios have been known to remove the anti-theft software post-launch.\nHowever, in a recent interview with Ars Technica, the Chief Operating Officer of Irdeto, the company that brought Denuvo in 2018, has said they're aware of the reputation the anti-piracy tool has.  COO Steve Huin admitted that \"we're seen as evil,\" in this modern era of gaming, particularly as they are \"helping DRM exist,\" and \"ensuring people make money out of games.\"\nHuin then goes on to say that technologies such as Denuvo are t…",

Wesley played through one of the stages in the game to get a feel for how classic fighters Billy and Jimmy feel and the three discuss their thoughts on these characters, the visual style, the combat, and more.\nEnjoy nearly 10 minutes of new Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons gameplay in the latest NGT below: \n\n\nDeveloper Secret Base and publisher Modus Games announced Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons earlier this summer with a special trailer that you can watch here. The game is set in New York City after it's been destroyed by nuclear war. Brawlers Billy and Jimmy set out to take back what remains from the violent gangs that have since taken over. However, they won't be doing it alone because the game features a roster of 13 playable fighters, including love interest Marian, newcomer Uncle Matin, and more. \nSecret Base says the beat 'em up features \"seamless tag team abilities and a multitude of strategies for devastating combos, defensive, and offensive moves.\" Players can swap characters on the fly, which you can see in the NGT above, as needed in combat. \nDouble Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on July 27. It will feature two-player local co-op at launch and online co-op is set to arrive later in a post-launch update. \nFor more previews and discussions of some of the biggest games of 2023 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Mortal Kombat 1, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective, Eternights, Bramble: The Mountain King, Humanity, Afterimage, Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster Collection, XDefiant, Sea of Stars, and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.\nAre you going to check out Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons later this month?

Now, shortly after the ruling, Microsoft has announced it will pause its appeal efforts against the Competition and Markets Authority in the U.K. so that it and the CMA can negotiate. \nBack in April, the UK regulatory body blocked Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard over cloud gaming concerns. With a July 18 deadline for the acquisition, Microsoft theoretically needs to either mark the U.K. out of its market as it relates to this purchase or negotiate a deal with the CMA to quell the regulator's concerns. Microsoft was previously set to appear in court to appeal the CMA's block on July 28. According to Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith, that won't be happening now as the two parties will instead attempt to negotiate a deal that satisfies both. \nOur statement on the mutual request with the CMA for a pause of our appeal in the UK: pic.twitter.com/8Aky2IJjxS\nJuly 11, 2023\nIt's important to note that the Competition Appeal Tribunal still needs to either approve or deny this request, as noted by The Verge, but the former seems incredibly likely. In a statement received by The Verge, the CMA said it is \"ready to consider any proposals from Microsoft to restructure the transaction in a way that would address the concerns set our in our Final Report,\" likely alluding to its concerns over cloud gaming (concerns that Microsoft disagrees with). \nGame Informer has reached out to the CMA for a statement regarding Smith's announcement and will update the story if a comment or statement is received. \nWhat do you think this means for Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard?

It’s set to release Let Them Come: Onslaught on PC via Steam Early Access in the first quarter of 2024. Let Them Come: Onslaught puts players behind the gun of a lone survivor on an alien planet who must survive hordes of creatures by activating nukes to blow up the planet. \nCheck out the teaser trailer for Let Them Come: Onslaught for yourself below:\n\n\nTuatara Games says the game features dynamic weather, and a wide range of weapons, including a flamethrower, laser beam, electric grenade, orbital strikes, and more. As you mow down hordes of aliens, you can upgrade your soldier with increased health, defense, reduced weapon cooldowns, and shields you can activate on the battlefield. To obtain these upgrades, you spend XP you earn on each run.\n“We are huge fans of this emerging gameplay experience, and are thrilled to reveal our love letter to the games that inspired us,” Tuatara Games founder Klemen Lozar writes in a press release. “Using our team’s VFX expertise, survivors can expect to fight for their lives through adrenaline-inducing experiences that have the best visuals of the genre.” \n\nLet Them Come: Onslaught also features roguelite elements, meaning a lot will be lost in between each run. However, credits collected on the battlefield stay with you, and you can spend them on permanent upgrades in the Armory. \nTuatara Games says Let Them Come: Onslaught hits Steam Early Access sometime in Q1 of 2024. It will cost $4.99. The team says, “The decision to launch first on Early Access comes from [the] continued knowledge in incorporating improvements to ensure the final 1.0 launch is as optimized as possible.”",

          "description": "EA Sports UFC 5 has been officially announced by Electronic Arts. The fifth iteration was long-presumed to be in-development, but during the UFC's tentpole International Fight Week event over the weekend, EA Sports and the UFC made it official. While no additional details were revealed outside of the logo, we know that a full reveal is coming in September of this year.\nEA Sports UFC 5 marks the longest gap between entries since the series' introduction. Since the first EA Sports UFC game arrived in 2014, the games have arrived every two years, with UFC 2 arriving in 2016, UFC 3 in 2018, and UFC 4 in 2020. The series has traditionally been developed by EA Vancouver, so that's the expectation with this entry as well, but no official confirmation has been provided by EA one way or the other on that front. EA Sports UFC 5 will also mark the first game in the series to launch since the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S hit the market, so we might be able to expect a leap forward in terms of graphical fidelity and/or performance.\nEA Sports UFC 4 launched on August 14, 2020, and introduced various customization options, as well as new grappling and takedown physics, plus a more fleshed-out single-player career mode. EA Sports has also continually updated the game's roster, adding tens of new fighters to the game in the time since its launch, with the most recent free update featuring Jack Della Maddalena, Erin Blanchfield, and Brandon Royval arriving just last week. For more on our thoughts on EA Sports UFC 4, check out our review here.\nWe'll learn more about EA Sports UFC 5 in September, but in the meantime, what do you hope is fixed, improved upon, or included in the next game? Let your thoughts be known in the comments below!",

          "description": "EA has announced that a Black Panther game is in the works. The title is being made by Cliffhanger Games, a new triple-A studio based in Seattle, in collaboration with Marvel Games.\nThe upcoming title is billed as a single-player story-driven third-person action-adventure game. In a press release, Cliffhanger states that “Our mission is to build an expansive and reactive world that empowers players to experience what it is like to take on the mantle of Wakanda’s protector, the Black Panther.”\nCliffhanger is led by Kevin Stephens, formerly of Monolith Productions (a studio currently making a Wonder Woman game), and consists of veteran talent who have worked on titles such as Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, God of War, Halo Infinite, and Call of Duty, among others. The team is still being assembled and is actively hiring. As such, this untitled Black Panther project is very early in development, so it will be a few years before it’s in our hands. \n“We’re dedicated to delivering fans a definitive and authentic Black Panther experience, giving them more agency and control over their narrative than they have ever experienced in a story-driven video game. Wakanda is a rich SuperHero sandbox, and our mission is to develop an epic world for players who love Black Panther and want to explore the world of Wakanda as much as we do,” said Kevin.\nBlack Panther made his comic debut in July 1966, and today’s news coincides with the character’s 57th anniversary. Although he’s been a playable character in numerous Marvel titles, he’s never starred in his own solo game until now. However, it's not the only upcoming game to let players assume the Black Panther mantle. Last year, Amy Hennig's Skydance New Media announced it’s making a Marvel game set during World War II starring Captain America, Black Panther Azzuri (the grandfather of T’Challa), alongside another Wakandan spy and Howling Commando member Gabriel Jones. \nTo keep up with other upcoming superhero games, we've made a list of them for you to check out here.",

The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.

          "description": "Sonic the Hedgehog co-creator Yuji Naka has been given a suspended prison sentence for insider trading.\nNews of this sentencing comes from IGN (via IGN Japan), which reports that the 57-year-old was \"found guilty of violating Japan's Financial Instruments and Exchange Act\" for insider trading after a July 7 court appearance at the Tokyo District Court. The judge in the case gave Naka a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence but suspended for four years, and two fines of 2 million yen and 170 million yen (approximately $14,000 and $1.1 million respectively). \nThis sentencing comes roughly a month after Abema Times reported in June that prosecutors on the case were asking that Naka go to prison for two years and six months and fines totaling roughly $1.2 million. However, Naka's defense asked that this fine and prison sentence be reduced. The final verdict arrived on July 7 in Japan. \nNaka, who also directed Balan Wonderworld, was arrested in November in connection to an insider trading investigation centered around a new Dragon Quest game. Naka was accused of purchasing 10,000 shares worth 2.8 million yen (roughly $20,000) in Aiming, the company behind that new mobile Dragon Quest game. \nLess than a month later, Naka was arrested once more on a second charge of insider trading; this time involving the now-defunct mobile battle royale, Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier. Naka was accused of purchasing 120,000 shares in Ateam, the developer behind the game, for approximately 144.7 million yen (more than $1 million). \nNaka has now been formally charged and sentenced for insider trading. \n[Source: IGN via IGN Japan]",

          "description": "Despite having pretty enjoyable gameplay, AEW: Fight Forever is woefully light on features and modes. That gets remedied a bit with the announcement that Stadium Stampede is hitting the game in an upcoming free update. \nStadium Stampede sees up to 30 wrestlers compete in a free-for-all inside a giant empty stadium. Like the real-life version, insanity is the name of the game, as players can assault each other using whatever is around them, whether it's chairs, tee shirt guns, Molotovs, golf carts, or even ride atop a horse. The last competitor standing wins, and the reveal trailer sells how much of a goofy mess it’s going to be (in a good way, hopefully). \n\n\nUnfortunately, there's no release date for this update other than that it's coming soon. AEW: Fight Forever has other DLC heading its way in the form of downloadable wrestler packs. FTR (Dax Harwood and Cash Wheeler) were added last month, and a pack containing Keith Lee and The Bunny becomes available on July 25. The final announced pack arrives on August 22 and adds Hook and Danhausen. Each of these packs also includes two new minigames. Each pack costs $11.99 and is included with the season pass. \nFor more on AEW: Fight Forever, check out our review here.",

But a recent report from Kotaku suggests that the company's commitment to the franchise might be going even deeper than we thought; Ubisoft has recently begun the process of remaking Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. \nThe remake is currently in \"its earliest stages,\" Kotaku reports, so details are scarce, and we won't be seeing it officially for a few years. A team at Ubisoft Singapore, a branch that has contributed to almost every mainline Assassin's Creed game, is said to be heavily involved. Most notably, Ubisoft Singapore worked on the creation of naval combat for Assassin's Creed III and IV, a success that would place it at the head of development for Ubisoft's naval-focused game, Skull and Bones. Of course, Skull and Bones is now notorious for its years of repeated delays – fans of Black Flag will just have to hope the seas will be calmer for the studio's next project.\n\n\nBlack Flag was released in 2013 on the eve of a new console generation, coming to PS3 and 360, but also to PS4, Xbox One, and Wii U. The game follows Edward Kenway – the pirate grandfather of the protagonist Connor from Assassin's Creed III – as he plunders the Caribbean and stumbles into the Assassin Brotherhood. Combining the series' classic stealth gameplay with naval exploration and combat, it's widely regarded as one of the franchise's best entries.

And now we know that game is Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth. As the name suggests, it takes place in 2033, which puts it between the original film and its sequel, Blade Runner 2049. Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth takes place in a dystopian Los Angeles like its cinematic predecessors, and the game's events occur after the Blackout hits. \nNot much else was revealed about the game, but you can check out its moody cinematic trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, this game looks very Blade Runner, and we can't wait to learn more about it. Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth's development is led by game director Chelsea Hash, who previously served as the director of Solar Ash and technical art lead on What Remains of Edith Finch. \nAnnapurna Interactive says Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth is the first new Blade Runner game for consoles and PC in development in 25 years. It's due out sometime in the future on consoles and PC, but there's no word on when to expect it. However, Annapurna Interactive says it will share more details about the game soon. \nAre you excited about this reveal? Let us know in the comments below!",

It looks great – we quite enjoyed playing it recently during Summer Game Fest 2023 – and you can check it out for yourself below in the newest Thirsty Suitors trailer: \n\n\nAs you can see, players take on the role of protagonist Jala, who, after a bad breakup, returns to her hometown. There, she must confront her exes and try to reconcile with them, please her tough-to-please parents, and mend broken friendships in time for her sister's wedding. To do all that, Jala will skateboard, take part in turn-based combat seemingly inspired by Persona and Pokémon, cook meals with her parents, and more. \nThirsty Suitors hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC via Steam on November 2. \nAre you going to check out Thirsty Suitors this November?

Ever since 2004, EA Sports' annualized Madden NFL series has been the exclusive franchise for the NFL, its teams, stadiums, and players. The result was the closure of other franchises, such as the competitive NFL 2K series, as well as the arcade-focused NFL Blitz franchise (which was later acquired by EA in 2011). The recently announced Wild Card Football from Saber Interactive, part of the Playgrounds franchise, hopes to smash through the established line to give players a fresh 7-on-7 arcade-facing take on the sport starring their favorite players.\nWild Card Football doesn't possess the NFL license, but rather the NFLPA license.

          "description": "While game delays have become commonplace, the opposite is extremely rare. Today, we learned Baldur's Gate 3 is somehow doing both at the same time. Initially planned for August 31, developer Larian Studios is advancing the PC release date to August 3 while delaying the PS5 version to September 6. According to the most recent community update, the change was done to prioritize release in order of platform readiness. More specifically, the team needed a little more time to get the PS5 version up to 60 frames per second.\n\"The PlayStation 5 version will be released roughly a week later than its originally scheduled date of August 31st,\" the community update reads. \"Baldur’s Gate 3 is targeting 60 frames-per-second and we’re close to achieving that on the platform but need a bit more extra time. We don’t want to compromise on quality, and feel it would be a shame to downscale to 30fps or make other compromises to hit an arbitrary date.\"\nMeanwhile, the PC version has moved up a whopping four weeks. Larian says, \"This means the PC version of Baldur’s Gate 3 will be released at a time where you’ll have more time to play it,\" likely in reference to the release of Starfield, Bethesda's massive upcoming open-world RPG. By releasing their game over a month earlier, it's a little less likely that gamers would have to choose one or the other to devote their time to.\nThe community update also casts a light cantrip on some of the features coming to the full game, including new spells, the addition of feats, the Half-Orc and Dragonborn races, the monk class, and a huge line-up of new subclasses, which you can see listed below.\nFor more Baldur's Gate 3, check out its Summer Game Fest trailer that revealed Jason Issacs' role in the game.",

Today is the day I removed the last few DNS entries pointing to AWS’s DNS servers, and I am proud to mention that (almost) all traffic is now routed via Cloudflare (and we aren’t even receiving sponsoring to say so). In this post I want to take you with me why this migration was needed, what the benefits are, and why you possibly care.

Faster download speeds for you (ranging from the in-game content service to downloading the game from our website). Easier maintainability of our infrastructure with thanks to Pulumi.
