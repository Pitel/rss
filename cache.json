          "description": "In all their horrific glory.\nWe all know how incredible the GameCube controller is, right? Heck, there's a reason so many people still prefer to use it for franchises such as Super Smash Bros.; it's awesome. If you've seen the prototype design of the controller, however, then you'll know that the early design was uhh... different? No, that's not the right word... Awful, there we go.\nIt's odd, because in terms of form factor, there's little that's actually changed from the prototype to the final retail product, but one glance will tell you that small changes can make a tonne of difference. Take the width, for example: you can see that the prototype controller is significantly wider than the retail model, with a more prominent gap between the d-pad and the c-stick. In addition, the handles either side are more pronounced, making the prototype look more like a boomerang than the controller we all know and love.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "And here comes a giant fist!\nLet’s get it out of the way. FIST: Forged in Shadow Torch on the Nintendo Switch is a frustrating game. Not in the sense that it’s difficult, but rather that it is so frustratingly close to being something great and doesn't quite make it. Like doing a pole vault and you crack your ankle on the pole. There’s a lot of good stuff in here, but a mixture of the game falling short of its potential and the Switch hardware struggling to keep up makes this one a bit harder to recommend.\nDeveloped by Shanghai-based TiGames in conjunction with Sony’s ‘China Hero Project’ initiative, FIST launched on PlayStation consoles and PC in 2021 before now making its way to Switch almost a year later. It's a dieselpunk Metroidvania in which you assume the role of an anthropomorphic rabbit named Rayton; a former pilot who has to take up 'arm' to fight back against the legion and their elite squadron, the Iron Dogs, who have occupied his home of Torch City. The arm in question quite literally being a giant arm that straps to Ray’s back — the eponymous FIST.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Say hello to GameTraderZero's 'Clicky Mod'.\nWhile we've seen plenty of pretenders to the throne, many Switch fans are of the opinion that the official Pro Controller is still the best pad to use when you're playing on the TV or in tabletop mode. It's comfortable, has a good D-Pad and offers the full range of features – motion control, HD Rumble and NFC support – some of which are often lacking in third-party alternatives.\nHowever, GameTraderZero – a company whose efforts we've covered in the past – thinks it has achieved the impossible and actually improved the stock Pro Controller. The firm has taken the standard pad and hand-soldered tactile button switches beneath the ABXY / LR buttons and the digital pad, providing an experience which certainly sounds different during gameplay. Furthermore, GameTraderZero has given the pad's ZL and ZR shoulder buttons 'hair triggers', so they emit a pleasant clicking sound when pressed.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

No mention of the game's release has been uttered by Rare, Nintendo, or Microsoft and it's now believed that the game may currently be in limbo due to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

To me, the Steam Deck did not do anything not already covered by the four different video game boxes I already own. The largest advantage afforded by the Steam Deck, the ability to play cool games on a handheld device, was surely the domain of the Nintendo Switch - a console that I personally use about once a year. Usually the process is that I go \"Oh yeah!\", pick up the Switch, and contemplate buying Breath Of The Wild before I see that it has not depreciated in value whatsoever since it came out five years ago. Then I turn off the Switch. \nLast week, though, I picked up the Switch, saw that Tangle Tower was on sale, and played it through in one go. \"This is great!\", I thought, marvelling at how I could play a game while sitting on the sofa, but leaving the TV free for my partner to watch whatever stupid TV show he wanted. I went to look for other cool indie games that might be on sale on the Switch, and that's when I discovered that the Switch eshop is hot garbage unless you know specifically what you're looking for. So now I want a Switch.\nRead more",

Naturally, curiosity got the better of me, so I dipped my toe back in to see what teenage Katharine had been blogging about in the mid to late 00s. Aside from all my custom images having been eaten, probably with the closure of whatever photo upload service I used back in the day, everything else was pretty much in tact. \nBut man alive. Those OPINIONS. Just terrible. Bad, awful, narrow-minded. In some ways it's quite funny looking back at how angry I was about Nintendo putting trains in a Zelda game, for example (joke's on me, Spirit Tracks would go on to become one of my fav Zelda games of all time), but in many ways I'm just quite glad I've (hopefully) moved on as a person, if only because recent weeks have reminded me there are still plenty of people out there like late 00s Katharine who are in all likelihood the same age I am now.

Like that smiling face with a tear running down one cheek emoji, I've watched friends discuss the trials and tribulations of a great Tigrex hunt and watched YouTube videos breaking down all the cool things you can do with the Insect Glaive.\nSo, with Monster Hunter Rise netting itself a bestest best badge and its Sunbreak expansion getting some serious praise in our review, I thought it was time to pull up my regular socks in the hopes that I could replace them with a pair woven from a big lizard's gooch. And I think I'm enjoying it? I think those socks could be mine? I just need to stop my brain from short-circuiting first.\nRead more",

          "description": "Madison is a fun game to write about. It's a puzzle horror game set in your traditional haunted house, aiming at a P.T. or Layers Of Fear vibe down the viewfinder of a Polaroid camera. Said camera was a second-hand gift for Luca's (that's you!) 16th birthday. It is also possessed by a demon, which is where the fun comes in, \"fun\" here meaning jump scares and hallucinatory clocks. Let that be a lesson to anyone thinking of getting their son something that was evidence in a murder as a present. This is one of many bad choices characters in Madison made. They are mostly now dead.\nThe game itself sometimes makes very good choices, though it's about 50/50 that it goes a bit too weird and ends up being silly. This makes for an intriguing mixture, especially with a complicated story of murder and neglect spanning decades, and by the end I was extremely fond of the way the sublime and the ridiculous sat side by side. The main let down isn't that Madison sometimes makes you giggle by accident, but that its multi-stage puzzles become so drawn out that you stop jumping at creepy angels and terrifying violin squeals. You've got numbers to write down and candles to move, and you don't have time for any demonic antics right now, godammit.\nRead more",

Or both! The first proper trailer of the game confirms only that it'll definitely be a mid-budget first-person shooter.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Ubisoft's pirate-themed live service MMO has been knocking around for almost a decade, having been overhauled a couple of times since it started life as a DLC for Asassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. But at a stream tonight it was revealed that Skull And Bones still exists, and not only that, but it has a release date of November 8th, 2022. Still a few months left to delay it again if necessary, but fingers crossed.\nRead more",

          "description": "Back in the mists of time, I actually had a hands on with Ubisoft's pirate 'em up Skull And Bones once. In my memory of it, I was an adolescent, which was categorically not the case and probably more a product of the booths at Gamescom being very tall, not to mention the hands on taking place so very long ago. At that time, the game was essentially the naval combat bit from AC: Black Flag, carved out and extended to be its own thing. Now, years later and with many delays and reworks bobbing about in its wake, Skull And Bones is back, and looking a bit different.\nThe current state of play for Skull And Bones was revealed with a livestream tonight, featuring an explainer video walking you through some of the game features, a chonk of the game in piratical action, and a surprisingly close release date confirmation for the 8th of November 2022 (there's still time for it to be delayed again!). All those extra months in the oven have produced a decidedly Sea Of Thieves-shaped bun. But this one is all realistic and gritty, more complicated, and is taking itself seriously. You won't catch Skull And Bones announcing its new season features with a comedy song, that's for sure.\nRead more",

Alas, while buyers of the PlayStation deluxe digital edition will also get to enjoy a brand-new port of PSP game Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth (an enhanced version of the very first Valkyrie game), Square Enix have decided not to include it in the equivalent PC edition. No, instead we’re being offered three desktop wallpapers, and a special in-game sword. Don your horned helmet and take a deep breath before you watch the trailer below.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I've taken a dustpan and brush to the map, sweeping up optional bosses and forts and quests with the wild energy of a cleaner who mustn't stop for even a second.

          "description": "Dragon Age is one of my favourite game series. I replayed Dragon Age: Origins recently not for this column, but for fun. That's the kind of wild gal I am. Origins was one of the reasons I got into PC gaming, because my dinky laptop wasn't good enough to run it and I was desperate to play it after seeing the trailers. I spaffed some of my student loan on a new desktop and spent four months eating nothing but cheese sandwiches. At the time it felt worth it. Watching those trailers now is like opening a time capsule full of fantasy tropes and, for some reason, an incongruous chugging guitar song by someone we don't need to mention ever again.\nReplaying it now is a different experience. It's still a really cool RPG, notable for very good world-building and a cast of interesting characters (that you can have sex with in a cold tent), and it continues to hold a dear place in my heart. On the other hand, there's a whole section that's such a mind-numbing slog to get through that everyone hates it and there's a mod specifically to remove it from the entire game. Origins is a game I very much like, yet sometimes struggle to explain why it is good. But I'm not alone in thinking so, 'cos in 2009 this was RPS's Game Of The Year. Can't blame me for that. I didn't even work here then.\nRead more",

Shots that, even with a 90% chance of hitting their target, still end up going wide and punching a hole in your carefully laid plans. In the moment, they induce feelings of white hot injustice, but for many, they're an integral part of what makes XCOM, well, XCOM. Looking back on his time making XCOM 2, however, Firaxis' creative director Jake Solomon tells me that he, too, now feels the pain players have felt for close to a decade.  \n\"It was really interesting for me to return back and play XCOM a couple of years ago, and man, when I missed shots, I was unbelievably frustrated. I felt the ghosts of everybody everywhere looking over my shoulder,\" he says.\nRead more",

          "description": "PlayStation classic set for comeback?\nPopular import outlet Play-Asia has updated its store with a listing for what appears to be a PS4 and Nintendo Switch port of classic PlayStation RPG SaGa Frontier 2. The site claims that the 90s sequel will launch on the aforementioned platforms on August 25 of this year.\n\"SaGa Frontier 2 introduces a complete renovation of the RPG genre,\" reads the blurb on the store listing. \"Traditional computer polygonal fixtures are replaced with lush, hand-drawn watercolor graphics supported by an awe-inspiring musical score. Blending both freedom and linearity, this title utilizes the Multi-Scenario System giving players unparalleled freedom in choosing which scenario they want to play while other scenarios crisscross with one another.\"\nOriginally released in 1999, Square Enix' SaGa Frontier 2 retained the original game' taste for medieval warfare with an Anglo-Saxon aesthetic. The sequel featured a player-chosen dual storyline, with the fates of two young men eventually crossing paths to form a wider narrative arc. Sporting Square Enix' typical penchant for lavish visuals, dramatic storytelling, and evocative music, SaGa Frontier 2 was well received by players and critics alike.\nSquare Enix is yet to officially announce a remaster, remake, or even a mere re-release for SaGa Frontier 2, and as such the Play-Asia listing should be taken with a pinch of salt for now. Obviously, the original SaGa Frontier was remastered for the same platforms just last year, so the sequel following suit is almost a given at this point.\nWe will be sure to give you a heads-up if any confirmation is forthcoming.\nPlay-Asia lists SaGa Frontier 2 for PS4, Switch [Gematsu]\nThe post SaGa Frontier 2 for PS4 and Switch pops up on Japanese retail site appeared first on Destructoid.",

But while the dramatic preview offered up some stylish visuals and dramatic pontificating, it failed to showcase any gameplay for the title, which is currently scheduled to launch on PC and next-gen platforms in 2023.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2RxYui-Jhc\nDeveloped by veteran studio KT Racing, Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown certainly sounds like an incredibly meaty undertaking, with a host of highly realistic licensed vehicles burning rubber through what has been touted as a meticulous \"1:1\" recreation of the entirety of Hong Kong Island. An emphasis on customization will allow players to not only fine-tune their cars' appearances to perfection but also customize the appearance of the driver themselves — a feature that takes center stage in the new Solar Crown trailer.\nFirst announced in the summer of 2020, Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown was originally expected to hit the streets this September, but became one of a litany of cross-gen releases pushed back to 2023. It was also confirmed that the PS4 and Xbox One editions of the title had been canceled. Now over two years into its development, with a release scheduled for sometime in the coming 18 months, fans are becoming a tad antsy at the persistent rolling out of cinematic trailers, and are starting to wonder when they will finally get to see the ambitious-sounding racer in action.\nTest Drive Unlimited Solar Crown is in development for PS5, PC, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown gets new trailer, but gameplay still eludes appeared first on Destructoid.",

From Pirate's Curses, to Risky's Revenges and even Seven Sirens, there's no denying that the magical gal and her fellow Scuttle Island denizens rank among the most likable, cheerful, and enduring characters of modern gaming.\nTo celebrate her 20th anniversary, boutique outlet Limited Run Games has opened pre-orders on this delightful statue. The figurine stands around 10 inches tall, (including the base), and spotlights shapeshifting adventurer in her classic genie garb and posed coyly at the viewer. There is no pajama Shantae variant, but we can't have everything.\n\nAs a fun addition, anybody who has been collecting the ongoing range of acrylic character standees will find that, once they are inserted into the base, that the statue lights up Shantae in all of her glory. It should be clearly stated that the acrylic figures are previous sale items and are NOT automatically included with the statue. An additional set of acrylics — depicting five Shantae game covers — are available in a bundle.\nIf you fancy a Shantae statue of your very own — and who wouldn't? — then she is available to pre-order now over at the official Limited Run Games store. The statue is $134.99 USD or $159.99 with the acrylic bundle, (not including shipping or any potential customs charges). Pre-orders will close on August 28, with the statue expected to ship in 2023.\nThe post Cute Shantae statue pre-orders live at Limited Run Games appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "(Otherwise known as the Titanfall universe)\nJob listings at Respawn Entertainment point to a \"new single-player adventure\" in development at the studio, and if you're a Titanfall fan who is also big into Apex Legends, you might be in luck. The posts describe an \"Apex Universe FPS Incubation\" project.\n\"This new single-player title is a developer’s dream playground with a freedom to innovate made possible by the unique universe it inhabits,\" according to a job listing for a senior environment artist spotted by Dexerto.\n\"Our critically acclaimed, multi-platform games have traditionally established a 'fun comes first' sensibility created with the notion that great ideas can come from anyone, which allows creativity to shine and individuals to shape the game in meaningful ways.\"\n\"Titanfall 3\" will probably always be one of those what-if scenarios, so I'm curious if this game will try to scratch that itch at all or take a different direction in this universe. Apex Legends may have the masses, but the Titanfall name still means a lot to fans.\nIt's easy to let wishful thinking get the better of us, but it is exciting to think about a single-player FPS from Respawn, with or without major ties to Titanfall. This studio knows how to build a compelling campaign, and with so much energy invested in multiplayer shooters these days, some of us could really go for another solo joint. The key word here, \"incubation,\" means we're in for a wait — assuming this game comes to fruition.\nRespawn is also hiring an art director to work on a \"new IP,\" which is also in the incubation phase. Between Apex Legends, new games, and Star Wars, busy times.\nThe post Respawn is hiring for a single-player FPS in the Apex Legends universe appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "\"No additional download required\"\nXenoblade Chronicles 3 dual audio will be part of the base game, Nintendo has revealed via a new tweet leading up to launch.\nSometimes on Nintendo consoles (read: not always) \"language packs\" are often used as a way to supplement a game's vocal options: optional downloads that you need to pick up, which can get annoying if you just want to pop in your physical cart and go. Well you can do just that, Nintendo says, at least if you're looking for English or Japanese voices.\nThe publisher posted a full one-minute video alongside the confirmation, splicing in the English cast with the Japanese one. You can hear pretty much everyone from the \"core six\" in action, and it's not even a major spoiler, as the clip has already been posted before (during the Nintendo Direct presentation for the game); and it's mostly a little traveling interlude with no major story implications.\nThis sort of dual audio at launch thing has become the norm for a lot of JRPGs, and I really dig it. I know some people can't stand a lot of the English voice acting for this series (I'm cool with it!), so the ability to swap immediately with Xenoblade Chronicles 3 dual audio will enhance a lot of people's experience quite a bit.\nhttps://twitter.com/NintendoEurope/status/1545392286049222658\nThe post Xenoblade Chronicles 3 will include dual audio at launch, on the cart appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "You get the Rabbid one I guess\nRabbid Rosalina is in for Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope, but the \"real\" Rosalina likely isn't, according to a new developer interview.\nProducer Xavier Manzanares spoke to Nintendo Everything about the game, and dropped at least one confirmation bomb on us: that Yoshi was 100% out for Sparks of Hope. Manzanares posits: \"When we started to think about the team and the heroes, we didn’t want to go for, ‘Okay, we did it before, so we have to do the same thing again’ and trying to evolve what we had in Kingdom Battle. So it’s true as well for the heroes.\"\nInstead, they \"decided early\" to adopt the framework of nine heroes. Since the game is \"not a direct sequel,\" they had a bit of leeway here, and chose characters based on archetypes, so that they could balance the gameplay around them. \"Edge,\" the game's big original character, was born out of this concept, as were Rabbid Rosalina and Bowser. Manzanares says the reaction to Rabbid Rosalina has made the team \"super happy,\" and refrains from confirming a \"real\" version of her (but does reconfirm Rabbid Mario, Rabbid Luigi, and Rabbid Peach).\nOf course, there's still a chance that Rosalina could appear as an unlockable character, and that Sparks of Hope has some tricks (or DLC) up its sleeve. But for now, I wouldn't count on it, as the current confirmed roster is looking pretty full.\nHere's a confirmation of all the Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope characters so far:\nMario\nRabbid Mario\nLuigi\nRabbid Luigi\nPeach\nRabbid Peach\nRabbid Rosalina\nBowser\nEdge (newcomer/original character)\nThe post New Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope dev comments seemingly confirm a lack of non-Rabbid Rosalina appeared first on Destructoid.",

We looked through a catalog of Pokémon Vivid Voltage cards a few days ago, and much to my surprise, he spontaneously renamed 150+ Pokémon. He actually didn't have much of a choice, because he's a little too young to read on his own. I suppose he could have forced me to read through the book for him, but that would have been pretty boring for both of us. Instead, he did it his own way, and I know I'm biased, but I think the results are pretty adorable, even when (or especially when?) they veer into bizarre potty humor territory.\nhttps://youtu.be/MC_Ce6dbh3c\nPicasso once said that it took him a lifetime to learn to paint like a child.\nFreeing your brain of self-criticism and the need to do things the \"correct\" way ain't easy, but it's the only way you're ever going to come up with new Pokémon names like Cocoon Butler and Jiggly Horror.

Rabio Lepus is a high-fantasy adventure that sees two robo-rabbit vessels, (the titular \"Rabio & Lepus\"), jet into battle on a brave mission to rescue the land's ruler, King Kitashirakawa, and his two bunny girl daughters, Komomo & Kotomi, from a nefarious alien force.\nCheck out the adorable rescue mission in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber ShiryuGL.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyFp3CwZqcg\nLike most titles in the genre, Rabbit Punch features large, colorful sprites battlings on equally colorful sci-fi horizons, taking on wave after wave of non-sequitur enemies including golem warriors, metallic cats, demonic elements, and giant demon head with a worm for a tongue. As you might have noticed, this entry isn't quite as cartoonish as Konami's Parodius or NMK's Hacha Mecha Fighter, but it still holds its own in the field of odd design. The international edition of the game removes the bunny girl princesses entirely. Spoilsports.\nRabio Lepus would find its way onto the home market in the form of 1990 PC Engine revamp Rabio Lepus Special, which sports expanded gameplay, new modes, enemies, and weapons. When Bally Midway's Sonic Wings series finally took flight, our long-eared heroes, (and the princesses), were not forgotten, making several cameo appearances in tribute to the franchise's humble origins.\nRabio Lepus is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nThe post Save the bunny gals in Arcade Archives shmup Rabio Lepus appeared first on Destructoid.",

I'm a strong believer that we just don't have enough couch co-op games out there, and gamers' outpouring of love for It Takes Two confirms that. There are plenty of good reasons why it took home Game of the Year at the 2021's Game Awards, and I think it's great to see such creative titles get the recognition it deserves. It Takes Two has continued to be successful after last year's award season, because this morning, developer Hazelight Studios announced that the game had surpassed 7 million copies sold.\nhttps://twitter.com/HazelightGames/status/1545422823899922437\nThe studio celebrated with a tweet that featured a picture of Cody's voice actor Joseph Balderrama and what appears to be a cardboard cutout of Cutie the elephant. Although Balderrama is lifting Cutie over his head, we're assured in the replies that nothing untoward is happening... sure, I'll believe that when I see it.\nIt Takes Two is one of the next games up in the long line of film and television adaptations, and we learned a few months ago that the upcoming movie based on the game will be produced by none other than Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson. Or, more specifically, it's being produced by Seven Bucks Productions, a studio founded by Johnson and Dany Garcia. Still no word on a cast or release date, but it at least gives us something to look forward to. Some fans are hoping for a sequel to the game as well, and I have to admit that \"It Takes Two 2\" is a pretty funny idea for a title.\nBig congrats again to the team behind It Takes Two, because 7 million copies sold is no small feat. Here's hoping that the game continues to have success in the future, and that Hazelight channels this momentum into another great release in the coming years.\nThe post It Takes Two surpasses 7 million copies sold appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "According to some recent job postings on Respawn Entertainment's career webpage, a new single-player FPS set in the Apex Legends universe is in early development. Eurogamer asks if this could be the long-awaited Titanfall 3 in disguise, but that remains to be seen since the posts don't mention anything about the wall-running, mech warfare FPS.\nReferred to as \"Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title,\" a Senior Environment Artist post states:\nA single-player FPS is not often announced, especially since the genre is synonymous with competitive play. A story-centric Apex Legends experience could focus on any number of the frontiers' eccentric personalities. It could even delve into Blisk's notorious Apex Predator squadron. In any case, the upcoming shooter would be in good company, seeing as its predecessor is still the best battle royale out right now.\nWhat do you make of this Apex Universe FPS Incubation Title? Where would the story take returning and new players, and what would you like to see? Let us know in the comments below. \n[Source: Eurogamer]",

That's what Robocop is programmed to do, and you'll soon get the chance to see the world through his visor in Robocop: Rogue City, a new game from developer Teyon and publisher Nacon. Peter Weller, the actor who became Robocop in the feature film, is reprising his role, bringing both his likeness and voice to this iconic '80s character.\nThe trailer above shows off roughly one minute of gameplay. Robocop's precision targeting is on display, as is his brute strength, which he uses to effortlessly push dumpsters and hurl enemies through the air. Rogue City tells a new story set around the same time as Paul Verhoeven's movie and somehow brings the powerful reboot ED-209 back into the mix.\nTeyon is the development house that released Terminator: Resistance. which recently was enhanced for new-gen machines. Robocop: Rogue City is slated to release in June 2023 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.",

According to information coming from Japan, Takahashi was found floating in shallow waters on the coast of Nago City on the Island of Okinawa by the country’s Coast Guard yesterday, July 6. He was wearing snorkeling gear when found by the Coast Guard. Both the Coast Guard and local police are investigating his death. \nTakahashi’s manga career began in 1982, but it didn’t truly take off until the release of Yu-Gi-Oh! in 1996. In between his start and Yu-Gi-Oh!, though, Takahashi published titles like Fighting Hawk and Tennenshoku Danji Buray, according to Kotaku. After Yu-Gi-Oh! hit shelves in 1996, the series only continued to grow in popularity, spawning a real-life card game in 1999 (that’s still extremely popular today) as well as multiple anime series. Today, the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise spans not just manga, card games, and anime, but video games as well, like this year’s Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel. \n[Source: NHK via IGN]\nThe staff at Game Informer extends their condolences to Takahashi’s family.",

Here’s what the official site has to say on the matter: \nThe Matrix Awakens was first announced and made available on the same night during the 2021 Game Awards. The Unreal Engine 5-powered demonstration from Epic Games stars Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss, who introduces the impressive graphics engine and how close to real-life its visuals can look. Awakens includes an on-rails car shootout throughout a city that often looks like it was ripped from the silver screen despite being rendered on the spot. The demo then lets you roam the massive pre-populated city and change things like time of day or traffic congestion to flex what UE5 is capable of. It’s a terrific showcase for the future of games, so if you haven’t given it a download yet, you’ll want to check it out before the delisting on Saturday.\nYou can watch us tour The Matrix Awakens in this episode of New Gameplay Today.",

That’s because the studio is launching Gwent: Rogue Mage, a new single-player roguelike deckbuilder, tomorrow. \nAnnounced by IGN, Gwent: Rogue Mage launches tomorrow, July 7, on PC, iOS, and Android. IGN reports that this game is what Project Golden Nekker, which the team revealed earlier this year, has turned into, and CD Projekt Red is marketing it as a single-player expansion to Gwent: The Witcher Card Game. However, you won’t need to own that because Rogue Mage is standalone. You can purchase the standalone version for $9.99 or the premium edition, which includes in-game skins and cosmetics, and card packs for the multiplayer portion of Gwent, for $19.99. \n“Rogue Mage came out of us noticing that years after The Witcher 3’s release, there are a significant number of players who want a more PvE experience from Gwent,” game director Vladimir Tortsov told IGN. “While Gwent multiplayer is a fantastic game for those who are looking for a great PvP multiplayer experience, we perfectly understand that many Witcher players loved the original mini-game of Gwent for totally different reasons. With Rogue Mage, we aim to give this audience a reason to play modern-day Gwent in the format they prefer.” \nIGN has an exclusive preview of Gwent: Rogue Mage after going hands-on with it ahead of tomorrow’s release, and if you’re looking for even more details about it, including what this single-player deckbuilder roguelike’s gameplay is like, be sure to check it out. \n[Source: IGN]\nAre you excited to check out Gwent: Rogue Mage?

          "description": "Valkyrie Elysium, the next entry in the previously dormant Valkyrie Profile series, has a new gameplay trailer and a pair of release dates.\nThe new video provides a lengthier look at the game’s action-oriented combat and story compared to its more enigmatic debut trailer back in March. \n\n\nSquare Enix also announced special editions and pre-order bonuses containing extra goodies based on the platform. Pre-ordering Valkyrie Elysium on PlayStation gets you the Alscir: Sword of the God of Light in-game item and a special themed avatar. The $74.99 Digital Deluxe Edition includes 72-hour early access, the Svartaljr: Sword of the Goddess of the Underworld in-game weapon, and a digital copy of Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth, the 2006 PSP port of the first Valkyrie Profile game. \nDon't worry, fans. Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth will also be sold separately on PS5/PS4 on September 29, so you don’t need to buy the Digital Deluxe Edition to play it. Additionally, after buying Elysium on PS4, you’ll also get access to the PS5 version. \nPre-ordering Valkyrie Elysium on Steam grants the 72-hour early access window and unique wallpapers. Its Digital Deluxe version also tosses in the Svartaljr: Sword of the Goddess of the Underworld. \nValkyrie Elysium will launch first on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on September 29. It then arrives on Steam on November 11.",

It describes the delay as a “strategic decision” and that we’ll learn more about the game in the near future. \nForspoken is no stranger to delays, as it was originally slated to arrive on May 24 before getting pushed to October 11. Though this second delay isn’t as long, it’s disappointing that we won’t get to experience Frey Holland’s adventure this year, but we trust that the delay will only help get the game up to snuff. The adventure drops Frey, a modern-day New Yorker, in the fantasy world of Athia where she acquires magical powers and a sentient talking bracelet. She’ll use her newfound abilities to free Athia from tyranny while also searching for a way back to her world. \nForspoken graced Game Informer’s cover in March, and you can catch up on a month’s worth of exclusive features and videos here.",

The new trailer released today is short and sweet but still packs a godly punch.

Fenrir plays a significant part in the Norse story of Ragnarok, but we won't spoil that here. Plus, Ragnarok's take on Fenrir could be completely different anyway.

          "description": "Nearly 30 years after its initial release, Live a Live is finally coming west. This 1994 Super Famicom RPG is from creator Takashi Tokita, one of the key developers behind Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy IV. While it would be fascinating to play through Tokita's original vision of Live a Live, we're getting an enhanced remake using the same HD-2D graphical style from the Octopath Traveler games.\nI recently spent roughly five hours in this ambitiously designed title, and can confidently say I enjoyed almost every second of its unique approach to storytelling and how it's brought to life through beautiful retro visuals. Square Enix is releasing Live a Live on Switch on July 22. Here are a handful reasons why you should put it on your radar:\nSeven Distinct Stories\nA Fun Assortment of Characters\nAdult Language and Humor?\nExcellent Writing\nCombat Has Depth...But Will We See It Enough?\n\n\nIt's Beautiful\nThe 2D-HD look is every bit as stunning as it is in Octopath Traveler. The backdrops in each story are a feast for the eyes. The sprite characters don't offer much animation but do move appropriately to convey an emotion or to highlight a dramatic sequence. The visuals scream of the 16-bit age, but also have modern touches everywhere, like realistic lighting of saloon doors swinging when the stranger strolls in to grab a drink.",

Skull and Bones showed promise when it was first announced during an E3 press conference in 2017. Slated to release in the following year, it was indefinitely delayed, even thought to be canceled given the lack of updates from Ubisoft. With fresh wind behind its sails, we will now see what it looks like on current-gen platforms. Come Thursday, you can view the Ubisoft Forward livestream right here.\nUbisoft also revealed a second livestream slated to air on September 10. We don't know what games are in this presentation, but Ubisoft's blog says it will be for multiple projects. Here's hoping Star Wars, Avatar, Assassin's Creed, and Splinter Cell are mentioned in some capacity, if not outright shown.\nUntil then, are you excited for Skull & Bones?

But like a person floating above the ground in the glow of an abducto beam, those moments aren’t connected to anything substantial; they just make some noise and get flung aside.\" The remake of the sequel modernizes more of the content.

In other words, I'm confident that Overwatch 2 might not look like a completely different experience from its forebear, but it definitely plays like one.  \n\n\nIt is important to keep in mind what is going on within Activision Blizzard regarding ongoing allegations about the work culture. The ongoing lawsuit from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against the company is over-reported toxic workplace culture. The bulk of the …",

          "description": "Starting a cult isn’t easy work, but somebody’s got to do it in Massive Monster’s Cult of the Lamb, which hits consoles and PC next month. Fortunately, the team behind the devilishly cute game has released a new trailer with tips and tricks to start, and maintain, the best cult.\nThe first step is simple: grow your flock. All you need to do is fight through hordes of demon monsters to save innocent woodland creatures that will make for perfect initiates. Of course, you rename each addition and select other facets of their new life to dictate what kind of cult member (and worker) they’ll be for you.\nCheck it out in action: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, growing your flock is just the first step. You also need to satisfy the faithful. To do this, you must tend to your congregation by leading and feeding them and ultimately keeping them happy. You can give them gifts, invite them to feasts, and much more. The final step is to cleanse the non-believers, naturally. \nUnhappy cult members might lose faith in you, but this is fixable. You can opt to re-educate them in the ways of your cult, which will hopefully stop them from persuading other members to rise against you, or, if you just can’t see a solution, you can always sacrifice them to the gods. \nAnd there you have it – you’re ready to start a cult. For more, watch Game Informer’s exclusive Cult of the Lamb New Gameplay Today, which features never-before-seen gameplay, and then watch this new gameplay trailer that recently debuted during Summer Game Fest, which is where we learned Cult of the Lamb will come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on Aug. 11. \nAre you excited for Cult of the Lamb?

The idea of getting a demo this year is certainly enticing too, as Sea of Stars has looked phenomenal every time it’s made an appearance. \nThe game was first revealed in 2020 after a successful Kickstarter campaign and evokes JRPGs like Chrono Trigger, Illusion of Gaia, and Breath of Fire. It even features music contributions by Chrono Trigger composer Yasunori Mitsuda. Despite being a role-playing title, it serves as a prequel to 2018’s The Messenger, a Ninja Gaiden-inspired action game that was well-recieved (here’s our review). Sea of Stars centers on two heroes who wield the power of the moon and the sun to battle an evil alchemist. You can watch the original reveal trailer below.",

In Pow Wow Entertainment's newly announced racer, Stuntfest: World Tour, I'm hoping the unique ejector-seat functionality is so jaw-droppingly incredible that it becomes the next craze. In the game's first trailer, we see drivers rocketing out of their cars to bounce off pads or ignite a jetpack's thrusters.\nStuntfest: World Tour is in development for PC with publishing duties handled by THQ Nordic sometime in 2022. We don't have many details yet, but a press release states that the player can assume the identity of a \"punker granny\" or a \"famous streamer\" with the hope of winning elimination-style stunt shows featuring 18 drivers. The competitions range from destruction derbies to glider racers. When the player hits the ejector button and their driver launches hundreds of meters into the air, they can be freely controlled and gadgets can be used to gain an edge. When descending, the next car you see can be yours to drive. Progress in the world tour rewards you with vehicle upgrades.\nStuntfest: World Tour has a hell of a hook, but it's difficult to figure out how these races will unfold. I can't wait to get my hands on this game to see if this unique gimmick (and the high levels of destruction) add up to something special.",

As EA notes, you cannot share your videos or screenshots from your play sessions.\nIf you are curious what Skate currently looks like or what you can expect from the gameplay, EA has released a trailer with the appropriate title \"Still working on it.\" The first few clips focus on bails, which must have been captured early in development given how rough the animations are. As the trailer moves on, the animations smooth out and the series' skating realism returns and is on display in a handful of awesome sequences. Full Circle also looks to be upping the scale of the challenges through some wild clips featuring impossible grind opportunities and huge ramps. Most of these clips are lack any kind of texturing or lighting and truly give us a look at how games are made.\nRegardless of where it is at in development, this trailer gives a fun look at a series that never should have left us.

          "description": "Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin is getting an expansion called Trials of the Dragon King. The DLC includes new gear, jobs, and enemies to fight. Check out the short trailer below; it's as deliciously chaotic as you'd expect. \nThere was once a group of warriors who attempted to defeat the darkness.\n@FinalFantasy Origin's first expansion Trials of the Dragon King launches July 20th. pic.twitter.com/YvGEwGh1ux\nJune 30, 2022\nIn Stranger of Paradise fashion, it's hard to parse through what's happening in the footage, but we see Jack and co. cleaving their way through armored adversaries ranging from shield-holding knights to winged beasts with dazzling blades of their own. In one scene, a kingly figure sits upon a throne – is it safe to assume this is the Dragon King? – and says, \"You will die here, and I will live forever.\" We're sure Jack will make him eat his words. \nStranger of Paradise is as bizarre as Final Fantasy gets. Andrew Reiner gave the game a 7 out of 10 and concluded his review by saying, \"Stranger of Paradise is the strangest Final Fantasy game yet, bounding wildly between awful and fantastic. If you can tolerate Jack (and that's a big ask), the excellently crafted combat is worth a look. You may be coming to this game for the story and Final Fantasy experience, but it's all about combat and little else.\"\nStranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin's first DLC expansion, Trials of the Dragon King, drops on July 20 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",
