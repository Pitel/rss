This is the first time the studio has revisited a world, its characters, and their stories, and as a result, is its very first direct sequel. In a way, that might seem disappointing, but this is Supergiant Games we're talking about. Hades is a masterclass in narrative design, addictive gameplay, rewarding progression, beautiful art, etc. It's excellent across the board. However — this will shock you — Hades II also happens to be brilliant, and it's not even finished yet!\nAfter 20 hours of playing through the Early Access version, available via Steam and the Epic Games Store, we can tell Supergiant already has another hit on its hands. The studio can't currently reveal what consoles it will be released on just yet — Switch Successor, maybe? We sure as hell hope so — but we couldn't wait that long. So we loaded up our Steam Deck to check out this God-like, rogue-like sequel.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "\"We recognize that it is becoming more challenging to maintain momentum\".\nNintendo President Shuntaro Furakawa was asked if he thinks the announcement of a \"successor to Nintendo Switch\" — which was made following the latest finacial report — will affect the momentum of the Switch's current sales.\nResponding during the Financial Results Briefing, Furakawa acknowledges that the sales target is high, but that \"Nintendo Switch hardware sales remain relatively strong\", but that it \"is becoming more challenging to maintain momentum as time passes\". The company projects that the Switch will shift a further 13.5 million units during FY2025, which is the Switch's eighth year on the market. This figure also doesn't factor in the Switch successor, either, so it's a pretty brave target.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Standing out from the crowd requires some careful balancing of the rules or implementing some gimmick to make your game feel unique. Or, in the case of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – Sweep the Board, you can let your licensed anime property do the work for you.\nPlenty of effort went into making Demon Slayer – Sweep the Board feel like it belongs in the world of the anime. The 12 playable characters include the three main ones as well as the nine Hashira who represent the best of the best among the Demon Slayer Corps. They each have little interactions with each other that make them feel true to the anime version of the character – Inosuke has a rivalry with Tanjiro, for example.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Computers have always been animal wells, in a sense. They're havens for creatures of many shapes and degrees of literalness, all the way down to the metal. As in ecologies at large, the most abundant and widespread are probably the bugs, beginning with the moth that flew into that Harvard Mark II in 1947 and ending with the teeming contents of the average free-to-play changelog. A little further up the food chain we find \"worms\", like the Creeper that once invaded the ARPANET, and \"gophers\", a directory/client system written in 1991 for the University of Minnesota. There are computer animals spawned by branding - foxes of fire and twittering birds and the anonymous beasts that haunt the margins of Google documents. There are computer animals that are implied by the verbs we use in computing - take \"browser\", derived from the old French word for nibbling at buds and sprouts, which suggests that all modern internet searches are innately herbivorous. \r\n\n \nRead more",

He was way more online when he was younger, and is the one who got me into the games of Lucasfilm, Troika and Blizzard, but these days he plays the games he likes a lot and does not read specialist websites that tell him why he shouldn't like them. He used to play loads of League Of Legends, but the game he was most into more recently was Hades. This is because he studied Classics.\nI won't tell you how many years its been since he was at university, but for many years - and still sort of now, to be honest - \"liking Apollo\" was a key part of his personality. It's interesting, therefore, to text him about Hades 2. Partly because he wasn't even aware it was happening.\nRead more",

A less demanding Manor Lords? A more casual Crusader Kings III? Total War with training wheels? It’s got shades of all these games, but thrown together with a wonderfully vibrant wood craft art style. It ends up as something I feel is going to be a lot more approachable for players who like the idea of massive medieval simulations but don’t care to spend time reading a Magna Carta-fat wiki to learn exactly what pop growth percentage is.

First, why get invested in another asymmetrical multiplayer game from a studio that has a bit of a history with limited shelf lives?

Unfortunately, in its attempt to eat Escape from Tarkov’s lunch – a timely one, given that game’s self-inflicted DLC misery – it’s currently choking on the wishbone of some truly dire performance issues. Even players with tip-top graphics cards are seeing heavy stuttering while out in the field, and none of the updates released thus far, including today’s Hotfix #3, have done much to soothe it.\nSaid hotfix does include some fixes for other widespread problems, including a second attempt at preventing players from becoming headless when rejoining a server (an amusing though resilient glitch, given a previous hotfix had also tried to nix it). But having played a bit of this third patch on a usually reliable RTX 4060, there’s clearly an awful lot of work left to do before Gray Zone Warfare performs acceptably.\nRead more",

It doesn’t crash, stutter, or hang, and there’s no point in talking about settings when it runs at a practically perfect 60fps on max quality. Make that 90fps on the Steam Deck OLED, too.

Amongst other things, they'd reach over and flick the power off while I was playing The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening. I didn't finish that game for 15 years. I'd flown the family nest before I braved the Eagle's Tower. Can you imagine what my friends would have done if I'd owned a Game Boy Camera? Probably, they'd have taken photos of... bottoms with it, and such. \nI'm aware I'm not making a great case for being a graduate of the School of Hard Knocks. The point is: I didn't have a Game Boy Camera then, so I'm delighted that the Game Boy Camera has caught on among a later generation of indie PC developers - prominent among them artist and educator Catharine Graffam, whose GB Camera Gallery: Mystery Show you can play for free in a browser.\n Read more",

Not ‘the country of Africa’ bad, but certainly not good enough that you’d want me on your pub quiz team. Also, I still do the Shredded Wheat rhyme internally when I have to follow directions.

Well, one such map is expanding before my confused idiot eyes, that being Total War: Pharaoh’s. It’s getting a new, distinctly Mesopotamia and Aegea-shaped bit. I believe that’s just south of Eastopotamia and Wegea.\n \nRead more",

Nokia skončila se Symbianem a přešla na nově vznikající systém Windows Phone.

          "description": "While Canonical has been investing more into the performance of Ubuntu Linux and engaged some new performance improvements in Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, it's still not the fastest Linux distribution out there on x86_64 hardware. Similarly, the recently released Fedora Workstation 40 features the brand new GCC 14 compiler and other leading-edge open-source software packages, but there's still more performance left on the table as shown by Intel. Here are some fresh benchmarks looking at how Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and Fedora Workstation 40 are competing with Intel's in-house Clear Linux distribution that offers aggressive x86_64 Linux performance defaults and the best possible out-of-the-box Linux performance on modern x86_64 hardware.",

This week, there’s one thing that’s got a few fans talking—The One Who Waits. This as-yet-unknown character was mentioned during The Giggle, which aired back in December, but the moniker comes back up during this week's second released episode, The Devil’s Chord.\n\n\nI’m going to hedge my bets and say that The One Who Waits is not a confirmation that Amy and Rory (the Doctor’s companions from the time of the Eleven…",

          "description": "Crow Country features only a handful of weapons,  but about half of them can be easily missed. The flamethrower, a late-game unlockable that relies on gasoline for fuel, is no exception. Let's quickly go over what you'll need to unlock it, 100% spoiler-free.\n\n\nFirst, you'll need to be sure you've obtained the Data Disk. This is a mandatory late-game item, so if you haven't found it yet, you don't need to worry about missing out on the flamethrower. Just come back to this guide once you've got your hands on it.\n\n\nNext, head to the Train Room:\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\nOnce inside, access the terminal at the back left of the room by using your Data Disk. You'll be met with a screen that asks you to assign a letter to each of a train's cars. The train on display in the room is your rubric, while the two plaques and buttons will give you clues as to which letter to assign to each car. \n\n\nThe first plaque says the cars it activates are done in the Arabella and Bernadette styles, while the second says its cars display the Arabella and Delilah styles. These are the letters you'll need to punch in the terminal, and the \"styles\" they refer to are the shapes found on the top of the cars (not their color, as I initially assumed). \n\n\nThe solution to the puzzle is as follows:\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\nAnd if you want to see exactly how these are determined, here's a quick breakdown of each \"style\" that appears on the two running trains (C is entered by process of elimination). The trip-up here is that \"A\" can appear as either a single rectangle or as two rectangles next to each other:\n\n\nDiagram by Destructoid.\n\n\nJust punch these in, and one of the cars in the display train will open containing your prize! By this point in the game, you're likely flush with fuel, so get out there and scorch some flesh.\n\nThe post How to get the flamethrower in Crow Country appeared first on Destructoid.",

Crow Country has its very own boss-killer, and you can get it about midway through the game. \n\n\nThere's only one prerequisite item: the silver key. If you don't have this yet, then there are actually several prerequisite items, but at the risk of spoiling the experience, you can revisit this guide once you've got your hands on it to get your shiny new gun as soon as possible.\n\n\nFirst, head over to the Gift Shop, located just off the main square:\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\nInside, you'll find several items for sale, each of which you can inspect to check the price. Near the cash register at the back of the shop is a note from Mr. Crow himself, which lists several items he's planning on picking out for his daughter Natalie. By adding the price of these items and entering the result, $19.75, into the register, we'll claim our prize:\n\n\n\nHaunted Hilltop stuffed toy - $5.50\n\n\nClassic Crow Country rubber doll - $10.00\n\n\nFairytale Town action figure - $4.25\n\n\n\nThe items aren't labeled exactly as they appear in the shop, and there are many to choose from, so some deductive reasoning goes a long way in finding the right ones.

Albums are enjoying their second coming in a mostly digital era, and initially, I picked up a few with the sole intent of hanging them on a barren bedroom wall.

          "description": "Choosing the right tradition in Stellaris is extremely important. And while it's typically dependent on your build, there is a good rule of thumb of which traditions you should even consider going with. We've put together a Stellaris Traditions Tier List for the most recent Machine Age expansion and 3.12 major content update.\n\n\nImage via Paradox Interactive\n\n\nStellaris: The Machine Age 3.12 Traditions Tier List \n\n\nThe recent Stellaris: The Machine Age expansion changed up some Traditions, as well as performed some balance changes across the board. While most builds remain relatively intact, some traditions are a lot more useful than others compared to previous versions. Here's our updated Traditions Tier List as of the Stellaris 3.12 update:\n\n\nS Tier\n\n\n\nStatecraft\n\n\nSupremacy\n\n\n\nA Tier\n\n\n\nDiscovery\n\n\nHarmony\n\n\nUnyielding\n\n\n\nB Tier\n\n\n\nDomination\n\n\nEnmity\n\n\nProsperity\n\n\n\nC Tier\n\n\n\nAdaptability\n\n\nAptitude\n\n\nEspionage\n\n\nExpansion\n\n\nMercantile\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nFor the most part, you're going to want to stick with the traditions in the S Tier and A Tier, as they are viable enough for most builds. This means you should always consider going with Discovery, Harmony, Statecraft, Supremacy, or Unyielding. \n\n\nDomination is a solid early tradition for Lithoid Slavers, but not useful for others. Enmity works against certain opponents but is also useless in others depending on the build of your rivals. If you have three rivals each focusing specifically on Economy, Research, and Military, Enmity allows you to gain the benefits of all three. Of course, this isn't a common scenario.\n\n\nProsperity has typically been one of the best Traditions in Stellaris. However, as of the Machine Age 3.12 update, Prosperity has been extremely nerfed making it nowhere near as viable as the traditions in the S and A tiers.\n\n\nAll of the traditions in the C Tier are extremely lacking at the moment, making them poor options when considered against the alternative options.\n\nThe post Stellaris Traditions Tier List appeared first on Destructoid.",

This casting comes from The Hollywood Reporter, which reports that the production will begin shooting mid-summer in England. \nIneson, whom you might also know from The VVitch, The Northman, and The Creator, joins a star-studded cast for the Marvel Cinematic Universe's first film about Marvel's First Family, which features Pedro Pascal (HBO's The Last of Us) as Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic, Vanessa Kirby (Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning) as Sue Storm/Invisible Woman, Joseph Quinn (Stranger Things) as Johnny Storm/Human Torch, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach (The Bear), as Ben Grimm/The Thing. Joining Ineson is a female Silver Surfer played by Julia Garner (Ozark).\n\n\nPaul Walter Hauser (Cobra Kai) and John Malkovich (Being John Malkovich) will also appear in The Fantastic Four, although their roles are currently undisclosed. \nIf you've played FFXVI, you already know Ineson has an incredible voice, certainly perfect for the role of a massive galactic entity that devours planets; we can't wait to see what he does as Galactus when The Fantastic Four hits theaters on July 25, 2025. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Final Fantasy XVI review, and then read Game Informer's exclusive interview with Final Fantasy XVI producer Naoki Yoshida about lessons learned, Clive's reception, loose ends, and more.

While each of the four studios affected, which also included Mighty Doom developer Alpha Dog Games and Bethesda support studio Roundhouse Games, released a statement about the closures, Xbox remained silent. \nHowever, four days later, Bloomberg's Dina Bass interviewed Xbox president Sarah Bond and asked her about the Bethesda closures, to which Bond cited a desire to keep the Xbox business healthy in the long term, even through hard transition periods. \n\n\nHere's what Bond said: \nBass then asked Bond specifically about the closure of Tango Gameworks after Hi-Fi Rush, which by Xbox's own admitted metrics, was a big success. Bond's answer here was less straightforward – you can read it below in full: \nWhile it's great that Bond addressed these closures at Xbox, it still lacks the clarity you'd expect from one of the biggest companies in the games industry. Neither Microsoft nor Xbox, including Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer, has yet to address the layoffs and closures in an official capacity beyond this.\nFor more, read about how Redfall was reportedly set to receive a big offline play update this month before Xbox shut down Arkane Austin, and then read about how Xbox is reportedly considering bringing Senua's Saga: Hellblade II to PlayStation 5. After that, check out this story about how more job cuts at Xbox are reportedly on the way, and then read about how the company is debating putting Call of Duty on Xbox Game Pass alongside a price hike. \nWhat do you think of Bond's answers?

          "description": "It's once again just about time for a new Pokémon Trading Card Game expansion to hit store shelves. Continuing the Scarlet & Violet series is Twilight Masquerade, a set that focuses on the Teal Mask DLC of the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet video games. Because of that, players can expect locations, characters, and Pokémon from Kitakami, the folklore-rich area from the first part of the Hidden Treasure of Area Zero storyline.\nAs such, new Pokémon like Bloodmoon Ursaluna, Fezandipiti, Okidogi, Munkidori, and Sinistcha are all featured in Twilight Masquerade. However, the most common new Pokémon I encountered during my opening of several booster packs sent over by The Pokémon Company was Ogerpon; I pulled several different versions of the grass-type Legendary Pokémon from The Teal Mask. \nPokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet – Twilight Masquerade adds 226 cards, including 14 new Pokémon ex cards, more than 30 Trainer cards, and dozens of special-illustration cards. I'll always love Gen I the most, so I was happy to add new cards featuring favorites like Alakazam, Zapdos, Ninetales, and Eevee, but my absolute favorites are the special illustration versions of Applin, Sunflora, and Infernape. I also adore the Hearthflame Mask Ogerpon ex card that I was lucky enough to grab.\nYou can check out my favorite cards I pulled from booster packs below.\n\n Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet – Twilight Masquerade is available on May 24.

Announced today at LudoNarraCon, the game is getting DLC called Stray Gods: Orpheus, which follows the titular character through a new adventure. Check out the reveal trailer below.\n\n\nOrpheus (played by Rent star Anthony Rapp) appeared in the base game, but only briefly, so this expansion will give players a better idea of his backstory and personality. The trailer also features Hermes (played by Erika Ishii), though their exact role in the DLC isn't clarified. The experience is roughly two hours long with six new interactive tracks and features some returning songwriters, including Austin Wintory, Simon Hall, and Montaigne, but also adds comedic musician Tom Cardy to the mix.\nAs for the plot, the following excerpt from a press release explains what to expect. \"When the curtain has fallen and the show is over, who do you go home as?\" it reads. \"Choose to reject, embrace, or rewrite the stories the world expects of you. Is the mortal world ready for the return of Ancient Greece’s most infamous bard?\"\n\nStray Gods: Orpheus hits PC on June 27, with a console release date \"coming soon.\" For more Stray Gods, check out our feature on how it was made.

This news comes from a Bloomberg report that says employees across the Xbox organization have been told to expect more cuts. \nThese potential layoffs would follow Xbox's decision to shutter four Bethesda studios earlier this week, including Hi-Fi Rush team Tango Gameworks and Redfall developer Arkane Austin. As for the staff offered voluntary severance agreements, Bloomberg reports that producers, quality assurance testers, and other staff at ZeniMax are receiving them. \n\n\nThe publication also reports the reason Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin were shut down this week is that they were in the process of pitching new projects and hiring additional staff for said projects, something suggested by ZeniMax head Jill Braff and Xbox president Matt Booty during a town hall held this week. Xbox and ZeniMax chose to shut these studios down – both in the beginning processes of creating new games – instead of closing a studio deeper in development on projects. \nElsewhere in Bloomberg's report, which details an internal town hall held at Xbox following the studio closures this week, Booty reportedly described its studios as spread too thin, like \"peanut butter on bread,\" and that leaders across the company felt understaffed. Xbox closed three studios and had ZeniMax Online Studios absorb Roundhouse Games to free up resources. Braff said during the meeting, \"It's hard to support nine studios all across the world with a lean central team with an ever-growing plate of things to do. I think we were about to topple over.\" \nThese studio closures follow the January layoffs of 1,900 employees at Xbox, Activision Blizzard, and ZeniMax, which add to the total of more than 10,000 laid off in the games industry just this year. \n[Source: Bloomberg]\nHow do you feel about Xbox?

However, its release arrives at a rocky period for Xbox, which just shuttered four Bethesda studios, including Hi-Fi Rush team Tango Gameworks and Redfall developer Arkane Austin. As a result, Xbox players have wondered how safe Hellblade II developer Ninja Theory might be after its sequel's release, given Hi-Fi Rush was a \"break out hit\" for the company but wasn't enough to keep Tango open. \nPerhaps to help boost Hellblade II's sales, Xbox is reportedly considering bringing the game to PlayStation 5, according to The Verge. The publication's Tom Warren writes, \"I understand Hellblade II is another game that Microsoft has been considering for the PS5. If that ever happens, at this point, it's not clear if even that would be considered a success.\" \n\n\nHellblade II coming to PS5 wouldn't be out of left field, considering Xbox has brought previously exclusive games like Grounded, Sea of Thieves, and Hi-Fi Rush to PS5 this year. However, with the launch of Hellblade II happening in just a few weeks, it seems if it does come to PS5, it will be post-launch, which lines up with Xbox's strategy in this realm thus far. \nSenua's Saga: Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 21, 2024. \nFor more about the game, check out the Senua's Saga: Hellblade II PC specs and system requirements, and then read about how Senua's Saga: Hellblade II will be locked to 30 FPS on Xbox Series X/S.

Even better, Mark Hamill is voicing the Clown Prince of Crime once more.\nThough we don’t see gameplay, a cinematic trailer sets up a dramatic confrontation (and likely emotional reunion for fans) between Batman, voiced in the game by the late Kevin Conroy, and his archnemesis. \n\n\nThis marks the first game to feature both Batman: The Animated Series actors together as their respective characters since 2018’s Lego DC Super Villans. Conroy passed away in 2022, and prior to 2024's Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, MultiVersus was the final game to feature his Batman performance. Following his death, Hamill had alluded to retiring the Joker role for good. However, dataminers uncovered Joker’s existence in MultiVersus in 2022 and found audio files revealing Hamill’s performance. This means he likely recorded his lines before Conroy’s passing. \nJoker is the first new character to join the existing line-up of fighters, but he won't be the last. We're curious to see who else joins the fray after MultiVersus re-launches on May 28 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

          "description": "Sega has revealed Sonic Rumble, a 32-player mobile platforming battle royale, and it's coming this winter. As is par for the course of battle royale-type games, Sonic Rumble puts 32 players against each other competing on various levels and obstacle courses to remain the last person standing. \nIn the reveal trailer, it's clear players control various characters from the universe of Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog series, including Sonic, of course, Tails, Knuckles, Shadow, Amy, Dr. Eggman, and presumably more. As you play, you collect rings and these are used to customize your characters in special outfits and more. \nCheck it out for yourself in the Sonic Rumble announce trailer below: \n\n\nThere's no release date for Sonic Rumble yet, but Sega says it's releasing this Winter. Given it's a mobile game, it's expected to hit iOS and Android. If you're interested in trying the game out, you can sign up for beta tests right now. \nFor more about everyone's favorite blue blur, read Game Informer's Sonic Frontiers review, and then read Game Informer's Sonic Superstars review.

          "description": "Arkane Austin was reportedly set to release a big Redfall update this month that would have added offline play to the always-online game before Microsoft suddenly shut the studio down, according to IGN. This follows yesterday's news that Microsoft was shutting down Arkane Austin, Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks, Mighty Doom studio Alpha Dog Games, and absorbing Roundhouse Games into ZeniMax Online Studios.\nThis offline play update would have addressed one of players' biggest complaints with the game – that Redfall always requires a connection to the internet – but now that update will never see the light of day. It's an especially concerning detail considering now that Arkane Austin is closed, the day when Redfall servers are no longer live, rendering the game unplayable, seems closer than ever before. \n\n\nIGN also reports that it was told the now-canceled Hero Pass, which would have added two additional playable characters to Redfall, was scheduled for release around Halloween. It obviously won't be released now – Bethesda says those who purchased the Hero Pass will be eligible \"to receive the value of the upgrade\" – but if it had hit the game around Halloween, that would have been roughly 18 months after Redfall's launch. \nRedfall hit Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 2 to poor reviews from critics – read Game Informer's review here – and players alike, and the first-person multiplayer vampire shooter failed to recover, with Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer saying, \"I'm upset with myself,\" when asked about its launch.\nAccording to reports, some of Arkane Austin's staff hoped Microsoft might cancel Redfall or reboot it as a single player game, following the former's acquisition of ZeniMax Media in 2020 for $7.5 billion. Arkane Austin director Harvey Smith said Microsoft canceled a PlayStation 5 version of Redfall following this acquisition. \n[Source: IGN]\nHow do you feel about Microsoft shutting down Arkane Austin?

Recent seasons have been themed after corners of the Marvel Universe, like Avengers vs. X-Men or Thunderbolts, but this season leans a bit more into the Marvel Multiverse with Blink and the Exiles. This season, titled \"A Blink in Time,\" introduces five new characters, two new locations, and more.\nThe new characters joining the game in A Blink in Time are as follows:\nBlink (5 Cost, 7 Power)\n\n\t\nOn reveal, swap the last card you played with a higher-cost card from your deck.\n\n\t\nNocturne (3 Cost, 5 Power)\n\t\nYou can move this once. When this moves, replace its location with a random new one.\n\n\t\nSage (3 Cost, 0 Power)\n\t\nOn reveal, +2 power for each different power among all other cards here.\n\n\t\nNamora (5 Cost, 6 Power)\n\t\nOn reveal, give +5 power to each of your cards alone at another location.\n\n\t\nSasquatch (6 Cost, 10 Power)\n\t\nCosts 1 less for each card you played last turn.\n\n                  \n\nOn top of those all-new characters joining Marvel Snap collections, there are two new locations: Panoptichron, where cards that didn't start in your deck get +2 power, and Cancun, where power at that location doesn't count toward winning the game. New albums featuring Dan Hipp and Rian Gonzales also further incentivize Variant collections by rewarding items themed after Werewolf By Night, Silk, and Iron Lad. Finally, we know the dates of the Series 5 releases of this season. Baron Zemo and Nocturne get their Series 5 release on May 7, Sage arrives on May 14, Namora on May 21, and Sasquatch on May 28.\nMarvel Snap's May season, A Blink in Time, kicks off today.

          "description": "Nintendo has revealed the Switch has surpassed 140 million units sold, further securing its current place as the second-best-selling console in the company's history. This news arrives at the same time Nintendo has revealed it will announce the Switch successor by March 2025, meaning there's still some time for the Switch to catch up to Nintendo's best-selling console: the Nintendo DS. \nSince the last financial results call, the Switch has sold an additional 1.96 million units, bringing its grand total up to 141.32. That keeps it in second place, only behind the Nintendo DS' massive 154.02 million. It's possible the Switch surpasses the Nintendo DS, especially considering the Switch will likely continue to sell even once its successor is released, but that's a big 13 million-unit gap to close. \n\n\nElsewhere in the financial results, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has hit 20.28 million units sold, Super Mario Bros. Wonder has sold through 11.96 million, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe another 6.79 million, and Pikmin 4 3.33 million. The fiscal year ending with March 2024 was a strong one for Switch software, selling 163.95 million units in Q1 through Q3 of Fiscal Year 2024. However, compared to the same quarters for Fiscal Year 2023, Switch software is down 4.7%. \nWith the Switch successor on the horizon, that number will likely be way up this time next year. \nIn the meantime, read about the Nintendo Direct happening next month, and then check out Game Informer's top 10 Switch games. After that, check out this list of the Switch's best-selling games. \nDo you think the Switch will surpass the Nintendo DS? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "Nintendo will reveal the Switch successor within the current fiscal year, which ends March 31, 2025. However, the company says there will be no mention of this successor during a Nintendo Direct it is holding in June; this Direct will instead be focused on the games coming to Switch in the second half of 2024. \nWhile this isn't the first hint of a Switch successor from the company, it is the most direct and comes from the same financial results where we learned the Switch has sold an additional 1.96 million units since the last one, bringing its total up to 141.32 million. Software has reached 1.235 billion units. \n\n\n\"This is Furukawa, President of Nintendo,\" the company's announcement reads on X (formerly Twitter). \"We will make an announcement about the successor to Nintendo Switch within this fiscal year. It will have been over nine years since we announced the existence of Nintendo Switch back in March 2015. We will be holding a Nintendo Direct this June regarding the Nintendo Switch software lineup for the latter half of 2024, but please be aware that there will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during that presentation.\"\nThis announcement follows industry reports from earlier this year stating the Switch successor was targeting a March 2025 release date. That could still be the case given Furukawa's reveal, but given the timeline, Nintendo could also announce the successor that month, meaning we likely wouldn't have it in our hands until later that year. Only time will, though, but at least we now officially know that by this time next year, we'll know what the successor to the Switch is. \nFor more, read about how Nintendo reportedly demoed the Switch successor to developers at Gamescom last year, and then check out Game Informer's top 10 Switch games. \nWhat do you hope to see from the Switch successor?

It can be a lot to dig into, given the game more or less tosses you into the deep end without context for how things work, at least initially. Instead of spending several runs figuring things out, here’s a short, spoiler-free primer explaining some core new features to get you going on the right foot. \nWhat Are Ashes? \nAshes are a currency used for unlocking Arcana cards.

Join Alex Van Aken – who visited Supergiant for the cover story and has played Hades II extensively – and myself for a look at the game's second area and boss fight. Spoilers ahead if you want to experience the locations and enemies for yourself, but otherwise, enjoy this New Gameplay Today episode!\nThis second area in Hades II is called Oceanus, an underwater realm Melinoë uses to bypass the armies of Chronos, the game's antagonist and Titan of Time. Oceanus is generally more difficult to navigate than Erebus, the first area, due to explosive hazards, more powerful ranged enemies, and darting schools of swordfish. The level culminates in a musical boss fight against a rock band of sirens led by Scylla, a well-known sea monster from Greek myth. Scylla sings while her keyboardist and drummer back her up. Despite sharing one health bar, the individual monsters can be stunned and knocked out of the fight, muting the appropriate instruments in the active music track.\nSee Oceanus And The Scylla Boss Fight In Action:\n\n\nHead to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

However, a PSN account will be required to play through Ghost of Tsushima's multiplayer Legends mode, or if you want to use the new PlayStation PC overlay to acquire trophies and more. \nThis follows news from last week where PlayStation announced (and later walked back) that Helldivers 2 players will soon be required to link a PSN account to their Steam account, leading to widespread anger in the game's community. It seems Sucker Punch is looking to get ahead of this by revealing its PSN plans ahead of the game's launch in 10 days. \nThank you for your feedback.\nMay 3, 2024\nIf you're unfamiliar with Ghost of Tsushima: Legends, it's a standalone multiplayer experience that allows you and up to three other players to fight enemies in special missions, defeat waves of foes, and complete raids. A PSN account will be required to play Legends, but if you want to play through the game's story (and Iki Island expansion), you won't need one. \nGhost of Tsushima hit PlayStation 4 on July 17, 2020, before launching on PlayStation 5 with a Director's Cut on August 20, 2021. This is the version of the game hitting PC in 10 days on May 16, 2024.\nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Ghost of Tsushima review, and then read about why the Director's Cut of Ghost of Tsushima is a must-play for fans. \n[Source: VideoGamesChronicle]\nAre you going to play Ghost of Tsushima on PC?

          "description": "Keoken Interactive, developer of Deliver Us The Moon and Deliver Us Mars, has laid off nearly its entire staff. The studio’s two founders are the only remaining employees.\nFounders Keon Deetman (CEO) and Paul Deetman (managing director) announced on social media that after the studio failed to secure funding during the Game Developer’s Conference (GDC) in March, it had “exhausted all our possible options for publishing, work for hire, and co-development.” As a result, the remainder of its staff has been let go. GameIndustry.biz confirmed that 13 employees were affected, 11 of which were full-time and 2 freelance contractors. \nThe Deetmans have made a call for any studios with open positions to hire its affected staff. The founders plan to stay in business and have vowed to rebuild, which includes launching a Kickstarter to crowdfund Deliver Us Home,  a sequel to Deliver Us Mars. \nIt was clear Keoken was in trouble when the founders posted a video in March revealing it had been unable to land a publishing deal after spending two years pitching five games to over 40 publishers. Instead, the founders decided to publicly reveal these projects to help garner interest, one of which was Deliver Us Home and two were Deliver Us The Moon spin-offs, including a VR game. \nKeoken once employed 45 employees, but the headcount was reduced to 20 by March 2024 before four more employees were let go that month. In an interview with GameIndustry.biz, the Deetmans revealed they had gone months without collecting a salary to help stay afloat.",

          "description": "Universal Orlando Resort has released a new video detailing what to expect at its Florida-based Super Nintendo World when it opens as a land in its Epic Universe theme park next year. In it, the company confirms the land will have three rides, including the Donkey Kong Mine Cart Madness coaster that's expected to open later this year in Osaka, Japan's Super Nintendo World. \nThe video includes digital fly-overs of the park, showing viewers what it will look like when it opens next year. If you've seen Super Nintendo World in Japan, this park looks nearly identical, with both the Donkey Kong Country (and mine cart coaster) section and the Mushroom Kingdom with Peach's Castle, Mt. Beanpole, the Mario Kart: Bowser's Challenge augmented-reality ride and Yoshi's Adventure dark ride. \nCheck it out for yourself in the new Super Nintendo World overview video below: \n\n\nAs you can see, the Donkey Kong Mine Cart Madness coaster will feature state-of-the-art track technology that allows it to create the illusion that riders will actually jump off the tracks, just like in the Donkey Kong Country games. \nLike in Hollywood's Super Nintendo World, which does not have the Yoshi's Adventure ride or the Donkey Kong expansion as a result of space at the location, and Osaka's Super Nintendo World, guests can purchase Power-Up Bands to play in interactive Key Challenges to earn coins and more. Plus, returning locations like the Toadstool Cafe restaurant and more will be at Orlando's iteration of the park. \nHere's a look at some of the locations to expect when Universal Epic Universe opens next year: \n\nFor more details about the park, read Game Informer's breakdown of everything coming to Epic Universe next year. After that, check out photos from our visit to Japan's Super Nintendo World, and then watch this vlog of our day at the theme park. \nAre you excited for Epic Universe and Orlando's Super Nintendo World?

This week, well over three years later, a 40-year-old former operator of an illicit IPTV service became the first person to be convicted under the PLSA. While a win is a win, the case wasn't entirely straightforward.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",
