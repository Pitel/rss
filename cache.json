Tears of the Kingdom, by comparison, has no such barrier and if you choose not to follow the direction that the game sends you in having completed the tutorial area, then there is every chance that you might not pick up the item altogether.\nSome of us tried this for a while, ambitiously setting off into the wasteland knowing full well that we were missing out on a pretty important bit of kit. But we soon returned to where the game originally wanted us to go with our tails between our legs, realising that traversal is near-impossible when you can't fly through the skies. And yet, one player has proven us wrong and has managed to complete the four main Regional Phenomena quests without Link's trusty glider in tow (thanks, Polygon).\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "The plot chickens.\nIt didn't take long for the good Zelda fans of the world to set their sites on the Koroks when Tears of the Kingdom was released a few weeks ago, and now, after countless times of watching these little guys getting rocketed, burnt, blown up or otherwise 'oof'-ed, it seems that the community has set its sights on another target.\nWe are, of course, talking about Cuccos — any Zelda fan's nemesis since they first jokingly took a swing at one back in Ocarina of Time. Unlike Koroks, this passive poultry is capable of dropping items when flustered, and that makes them all the more attractive a target to those bent on putting them through a living shell hell.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "What are Nintendo's post-Zelda plans?\nJune is here, which means that multiple publishers are just about ready to showcase their gaming plans for the months — and years — ahead. We like to think of it as 'Gaming Christmas', if you will — lots of game news goodies coming all at once (as opposed to actual Christmas when there's not a lick of game news because everyone's on holiday).\nNaturally, in the wake of E3's cancelation, the big industry focus this year is Summer Game Fest, where more than 40 gaming partners will showcase their wares for an eager audience, including Sega, Devolver, Bandai Namco, and more. Other companies like Microsoft and Ubisoft, while not technically part of Summer Game Fest, will also reveal what they've been working on in their own showcases. The E3 Hype Train might be out of commission for the time being, but there are plenty of passengers on the platform looking for something exciting as we approach the summer months of gaming.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Shooting Watch.\nIn the 1980s, Takahashi Meijin was a supermarket clerk turned home programmer, eventually picked up by Hudson Soft to work as a software salesman. This, however, was only the start of his journey into 8-bit stardom. In 1985 he co-presented a TV show in Japan that hosted tournaments, usually for Hudson Soft’s shoot 'em up catalogue and its featured competitive ‘Caravan’ modes: quick, timed stages designed to be perfected by accruing as high a score as possible. It turned out Meijin was a skilled player himself, and with his distinctive, bald appearance, he quickly rose to fame by demonstrating his 'trigger finger' speed technique. Kids at home attempted to emulate his impressively fast button mashing, to the point where a Mejin-branded Shooting Watch was released: a simple two-button toy with a digital display that would record the number of presses one could achieve within a time limit. At the height of his fame, Hudson Soft used his likeness for Master Higgins, the protagonist of their Adventure Island series.\nStar Gagnant, partly crowd-funded and created with Meijin’s input, features him as Captain Takahashi in anime form. It also has a cute virtual version of his Shooting Watch toy tucked away as a bonus option, allowing you to test your own trigger finger speeds.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

To get this price, you'll need to use code CMJUND2 at the cart and then use a rebate form for an additional $25 back.

Like your bus arriving on time, a minute after watching the previous, late-arriving one flip onto its roof attempting a handbrake turn.  \nIt’s not perfect, but Diablo IV does run smoothly for the most part (also sorry Google, but I'm going back to Roman numberals), and its system requirements on PC are as likely to involve museum pieces as they are the latest and priciest graphics cards. I’ve put some hours into the early access build and have come up with a best settings guide, but in truth, this will likely just optimise your framerates – Diablo IV’s higher quality settings rarely trouble it, especially at 1080p.\nRead more",

It hasn't hit the emotional highs of the kind of interactive fiction I favour, but for a story with such heavy themes, it provides a relaxing drip feed of mystery reveals and plot thickenings in between low-pressure minigames. It's a good time, without undermining its obvious respect for the people who had to live through this.\nRead more",

He’d come to the tech expo with Condor, a studio he’d co-founded only a few months prior, to show off Justice League: Task Force. A humble fighting game in the vein of Street Fighter, it was given a small demo booth and placed next to another game that featured a cast of superheroes, a strikingly similar visual style and, much to Brevik’s surprise, the very same name.\r\n\n\r\nWithout their knowing, Condor were one of two studios hired to develop the DC Comics tie-in: their Sega Mega Drive/Genesis version set to release alongside a SNES title made by another recently formed team, Silicon & Synapse. “We'd never talked to them,” Brevik says. “We'd never interacted with them. We didn't know there was even another version, and then we show up at the booth and they're side by side, and we're like, this is really weird.” They didn't know it yet, but these Justice League sort-of clones were the first paving stones on the road to the Diablo series. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "When RPS awarded Kentucky Route Zero the title of Game Of The Year in 2013, only two episodes out of an eventual five had been released. If this sounds like a bland statement of fact, just think about it for a second. I can't recall any other time an episodic adventure game has received GOTY-level praise before it was even concluded, let alone only 40% done.\nEpisodes three through five arrived sporadically: in spring 2014, summer 2016, and — after what must have been an agonising hiatus — the start of 2020. Having bypassed this wait to play the game for the first time only recently, I feel wistfully as though I'll never share quite the same fond feelings for it as contemporary fans (like our own reviews ranger Rachel, who recently named KRZ one of her all-time favourite indie games). But I'm also quite relieved that I didn't have to exercise that kind of patience. I mean, I'm very good at neglecting to carry on with games for years at a time despite thoroughly enjoying what I've played so far. But I like doing it on my terms, you know?\nI initially attempted to do something a bit clever with this retrospective. I wanted to play the first two episodes that earned KRZ our GOTY nod in 2013, and write up on them as a discrete entity as far as possible. Only then did I plan to carry on the game and add some follow-up impressions, perhaps assessing whether I thought RPS would still award the big chocolate medal to the full game as it finally came to be in 2020. But, after sitting with my feelings about Episodes 1-2 for a couple of weeks, any intelligent observations I might have made were drowned out by an increasingly loud, insistent voice in the back of my head howling: \"I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS.\" Actually, that might be a good impression to just let stand on its own merits.\n Read more",

My bolognese is about as authentically Italian as Super Mario, but it doesn’t matter. I’m not trying to make Massimo Bottura cry by reminding him of his nonna’s cooking. It’s a dreary Tuesday night and I’m craving my olive-laden concoction. I’m making this bolognese just for me.\r\n\n\nSlayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer reminded me a lot of my bolognese.

          "description": "If you woke up in a mysterious mansion, with no memory of how you got there and only a walkie-talkie and a bunch of security cameras for company, how d'you reckon you'd handle it? Personally I know, sure as eggs is eggs, that I would absolutely go to pieces. I'm not hitting the end credits of The Tartarus Key in real life, but fortunately, it's a nails thriller puzzle game that fuses PS1-style retro graphics with Saw-esque murder traps. Plus, you know, it's only about six hours end to end, which isn't bad for a semi-magical kidnap plot.\nIn this situation I am not me, of course, but Alex Young, and Alex upon escaping a locked study (an easy warm-up puzzle involving postcards) she finds and frees Torres, an ex-cop turned private detective, who sets up a base of operations around the mysterious mansions main fireplace. From there game's rhythm is clearing the different wings of the house by completing increasingly difficult puzzle rooms, each eventually culminating in finding a new person to save from a new death trap - concocting the antidote for poison or following the instructions to get through an electrocuted floor maze.\nIt's an odd group, but if you rescue everyone you start to see the edges of a wider story. There's a nice layering of paranoia, because most of the puzzles have an element of, for want of a better word, magic to them. One of the very first sees you tasked with getting an academic out of a living flesh-blob, and failure results in it and him vanishing into nowhere. You also find an underground lab with notes on scientific experiments, and a holding cell slash testing chamber - but given that next door is a giant meat freezer sokoban, is it not the case that the lab is just another puzzle room set? The low-poly, low-draw distance style of everything really adds to this, and you keep suspecting that some new puzzle or trap or maybe a weird murderer is going to suddenly loom out of the darkness in front of you. It's the kind of head melting I haven't had since playing Old Gods Rising.\n Read more",

          "description": "I feel like claymation has always been a bit creepy, you know? Yeah, sure the Aardman films are whimsical and fun, but have you seen those early Wallace and Gromit shorts? There’s something kind of unsettling about the odd shape of Wallace’s uneven head and I've always deeply hated that you can sometimes see the subtle lines of a thumb imprint on parts of his face, like he’s been smothered inbetween the pads of two giant fingers. It’s so uncomfortable - and don’t even get me started on that monster Morph.\nEver since I first spotted the creepy Twitter gifs of claymation game Elation For The Wonder Box 6000, I’ve felt that same discomfort in the pit of my stomach. It’s not out yet, or even has a confirmed release date, but I just need people to witness this game. Like, just clicking through the screenshots make the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. It’s awful, and wonderful. You can watch the trailer below. The bit where the lumps of clay wriggle inside the gun's bullet chambers goes through me.\nRead more",

          "description": "One of my absolute favourite elements of Citizen Sleeper is how you essentially play as a nobody. When we first meet the Sleeper they've had their memories completely erased; the last thing they remember is stuffing themselves into a cargo container and shooting off into the depths of space - a last resort in wanting to escape the clutches of a scary corporation. They now find themselves on a dishevelled space station called Erlin's Eye, desperate and alone. They're essentially an empty shell, and one which you can etch your own story onto.\nBut it’s not their lack of personal identity that makes the Sleeper a nobody (after all, you essentially forge an identity for them as you make decisions throughout the game). It’s the realisation that, in this vast universe that developer Gareth Damian Martin has written, you’re no one. A single grain of sand in a vast desert. No one knows who you are, no one cares about you, and you’re stuck on a lawless space station, helpless, scared, and dying.\nRead more",

He had no business background, and none of the acumen required to understand contracts or negotiate licensing fees. More to the point, he had no more than $5,000 to his name.

          "description": "Playing Diablo 4 gave me a real case of the \"Have I changed, or have the games changed?\", and I think the answer is \"yes\". For the uninitiated, Diablo forms one of the jewels in Blizzard's crown (maybe a smaller one, just offset to the Warcraft centre stone), an action-RPG series that's like if the kind of 90s metal album cover that has a skeleton on it asked to be turned into a game where you explode many hundreds of near-identical monsters to get incrementally better loot. This is a spoiler-free review of the latest greatest addition, following 2012's Diablo 3, but a Diablo game's story is sort of unspoilable, both because a) paying attention to it is of passing importance to playing, and b) the plot of them is always basically the same anyway.\nTo wit: Sanctuary, a high-fantasy world with a low-fantasy vibe, where so much as going to the next town over will be a brush with some horrible little goblin rat called a Flesh Thresher, was created as a respite from the eternal battle between heaven and hell. After X number of years of relative peace, one (or many) of the Lords Of Hell is doin' some bad stuff. Usually Diablo, I'll grant you. In this case it's Lilith, a kind of Dante's Lady Dimetrescu, who's making people horny for being stepped on power. Diablo games have always had a Grand Canyon sized gulf between the cinematics (epic; luscious; brutal) and the game in practise (clicking). IV is no different. And you know. It's fine.\nRead more",

          "description": "For a certain sort of PC gaming fan, System Shock is where it all began. 30 years of immersive sim development started here, as Looking Glass escaped the restraints of the RPG genre and embraced thoughtful first-person action. SHODAN broke free, and the world was never the same. Without System Shock, there would be no Thief or Gloomwood, no Prey or Dead Space. Bioshock was conceived as its sequel. The creative figureheads behind Deus Ex and Dishonored were wrapped up in its creation, and forever changed by contact with Looking Glass and its unique philosophy.\nCountless studios have used Citadel Station as a star to steer by, measuring their own work against System Shock’s commitment to simulation, dense atmosphere, and method-ish refusal to break character. This was not so much a game as an alternate reality. As one of our interviewees tells us: “We were trying to build the holodeck.”\nHere’s the story of how it was made, as told by the people who made it.\nRead more",

          "description": "Back in February 1991, Capcom released Street Fighter 2 to arcades. Unbeknownst to Capcom at the time, Street Fighter 2’s massive success would cause it to become the blueprint for fighting games - a genre the game effectively created upon its release. This blueprint proved to be so influential that even some of Street Fighter 2’s most underwhelming elements are still being parroted in fighting games today. As a result, more than 30 years later, one constant in the fighting game genre has always remained true: the story mode is gonna suck.\nThere have been some valiant attempts at rectifying this in the last decade, but the core issue has always remained the same; fighting games are inherently designed to be played against other people, and back-to-back fights with AI controlled characters will never be able to properly match the competition of the real thing. Yet, with Street Fighter 6, Capcom have seemingly done the impossible. Street Fighter 6 has the best story mode in any fighting game I’ve played. Admittedly a low bar, but still, Capcom could have easily half-assed the story mode, just as so many other fighting games still choose to do, and still have been widely praised based solely on the strength of its multiplayer. Instead, Capcom are offering fighting game developers a new blueprint to copy - one that prioritises teaching new players above everything else.\nRead more",

An AI could probably replicate my writing style quite thoroughly, because there are at present many thousands of my - mine, my own - words on the internet, and they and everything else have and are being scraped by AI. This thought process is as a result of a few AI things intersecting with my workspace at once recently. Several of them are quite funny, and also not. If you think AI tools are actually good for writers then I have to assume you don't really think much about either.\nRead more",

Not an assault rifle or mini-pistol, but a decades-old email chain between her TriOptimum bosses and a psychologist named Jeffrey Hammer. In the early stages of Citadel’s construction, Hammer suggested that each level of the station be designed in such a way as to induce stress and anxiety, so that experts could study their impact on the human psyche during space travel.\n“I always knew something was off about this place!”, wrote Stacy to a colleague. “We are just rats in a maze.”\nRead more",

          "description": "When my Sleeper escaped their ramshackle life on the fringes of Erlin's Eye at the end of last year, they left behind a lot of unfinished business. I had to stop short my efforts to help Bliss make a go of her repair bay business, and Tala was left to finish making her brand-new distillery on her own. Yatagan agent Rabiyah probably has my name on an employment blacklist, too, after I upped sticks without telling them, and the spores of mushroom algae I'd been cultivating for Riko over in Greenway were no doubt left to rot and moulder somewhere. Instead, I jacked that all in to smuggle myself, my engineering pal Lem and his tiny daughter Mina onto a ship headed for some far-flung star out in the void. The Sidereal ship wasn't going to wait. It was now or never.\nFortunately hitting an ending in Citizen Sleeper doesn't mean the end of your save. Booting it back up again for this month's RPS Game Club, I wanted to play out a different ending to my Sleeper's story. Turning my back on Lem and Mina still brought its own kind of sadness, admittedly, but I wanted to dig into the game's trio of free DLC episodes first and foremost, as that was another thing I never got time to start last year. I've only played through the first chapter, Flux, so far, but man alive, it was not an auspicious start for the refugee flotilla ship hoping to make a new life for themselves here. In fact, I don't think it could have gone any worse, such was the monumental failure of my collective dice rolls and decision making. But despite absolutely beefing it in Flux, I also came to realise an important lesson. It's okay to fail, and that failure can often make the consequences of your actions feel all the more poignant. Sure, it might not feel nice, and yes, I wish it could have gone better. But sometimes the odds really are stacked against you, and you've just got to roll with it.\nRead more",

          "description": "2023 has seen the closure of more big multiplayer games than, well, any time I can recall in recent memory. One after the other, developers' dreams of making the next big Destiny-like have gradually collapsed in on themselves. Like a deflated concertina, their last honks of life have been crushed down to desperate, fizzling squeals as servers lie empty and the cost of maintaining them spirals out of control. Some are still hanging in there, sure, but the genre as a whole feels like it's at a tipping point - and I couldn't help but sigh as five more multiplayer shooters joined the fray last night as part of Sony's PlayStation Showcase. \nRead more",

I got to see a little bit of an alpha build of Realms Of Ruin in action ahead of tonight's Skulls stream, and if you're a fan of tabletop miniatures, this is definitely an RTS you'll want to keep an eye on, as Frontier have gone all out on making this look as close to Age Of Sigmar's TT origins as they can.

Nachystejte si ledové kávy, mojita a vodní chladiče a pojďte se se strahovskými bastlíři pobavit o technice a bastlení!\r\n\r\nPtáte se, co mají bastlíři za novinky? Například se ukázalo, že OLED s SSD1306 ve skutečnosti nejsou nutně jen černobílé. Vyšla také nová verze KiCADu včetně betaverze pluginu pro tvorbu databázových knihoven pro KiCAD v InvenTree a na internetu se objevil USB programátor/debugger ESP32 postavený na ESP32 nebo nové procesory od SiLabsu obsahující (mimo jiné) i RISC-V jádro.\r\n\r\nZ kategorie vysokofrekvenčního bastlení pak strahováci nabídnou vhled do vstupní impedance osciloskopů - jak ji změřit, proč 50 Ohm režim na osciloskopu zpravidla není zrovna 50 Ohm, jak osciloskop skutečně přizpůsobit, kde na to vzít šikovný materiál a jak jednoduše a přitom zadarmo na RF simulace. Pro majitele vektorových analyzátorů NanoVNA/LiteVNA pak ukážou dvě internetová fóra (jedno \"tajné a uzavřené\"), kde se dají sehnat aktualizace FW a podpora (jak SW, tak HW) a popíšou i postup aktualizace.\r\n\r\nAť už vás zaujalo cokoliv z nabízených témat nebo chcete ukázat nějaký svůj bastl, dorazte! Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v úterý 6. června od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

          "description": "Over 30 updates launches so far\nStudios Motion Twin and Evil Empire have announced that popular fantasy Metroidvania Dead Cells has now smashed past 10 million global sales. This incredible number represents an accumulation of sales on PC and console since the games' Early Access debut back in the summer of 2017.\n\"Following the success of Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania, Evil Empire has been exploring the path forward for the title as a whole,\" said the studio in a celebratory statement. \"With years of successful updates and expansions behind it after taking over live ops of Dead Cells in 2019, the studio is tinkering with its time-tested methodology, experimenting with ideas for future updates and new ways for fans to enjoy one of their favorite roguelikes.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBBwIHYm8Mw&ab_channel=MotionTwin\nThe studio also revealed that plans are in motion to develop new updates and DLC for Dead Cells for the foreseeable future — with new content drops planned until at least 2025. Just recently, Dead Cells fans were able to enjoy the aforementioned Return to Castlevania DLC, which saw Dead Cells partner with one of the foremost titles in the Metroidvania genre, bringing familiar locales, enemies, and bosses to the title.\nOutside of the digital realm, Dead Cells is also being adapted for the tabletop crowd, with an official board game in the works at Scorpion Masque. This project opened its crowdfunding campaign with a $30,000 USD target, and successfully raised around half a million dollars in less than fifteen minutes. Clearly, even with an amazing 10 million sales under its tunic, Dead Cells is only just beginning to open up its fascinatingly weird universe\nDead Cells is available now on PS4, PC, Xbox One, and iOS and Android platforms.\nThe post Dead Cells hits 10 million sales, further content updates in the works appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Throughout the Spider-Verse\nThe latest Spidey film Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse opened over the weekend. Amid the action, some have noticed gameplay footage of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 casually playing during one scene.\nWhen this was pointed out, fans posted on Resetera about it. In response, as spotted by Eurogamer, Insomniac community director James Stevenson confirmed \"it is new.\"\nIt's a relatively small, tucked-away cameo that appears on a television early in the movie. I saw Spider-Verse over the weekend and noticed some gameplay, but figured it was just a plug of some already seen footage. It's hard to actually discern anything major out of it, aside from seeing some mechanical arms on Peter's suit.\nSo while it's a neat little easter egg, I don't think you need to buy a movie ticket just to see some new gameplay.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrPZSq5YXqc\nDoing whatever a spider can\nIt's not like we need new gameplay right away, anyways. We got a pretty big spotlight on the new Spider-Man game from Insomniac at the recent PlayStation Showcase. We saw both Peter and Miles, and how the game will swap between the two at key moments for its story.\nKraven, Lizard, and more also pop up during the spotlight too. It's certainly not as laden with Spider-People as Across the Spider-Verse is, but it's looking like Insomniac has a lot of Spidey action planned for this fall.\nMeanwhile, while you shouldn't pick up a ticket for the gameplay cameo, you should definitely still go see Across the Spider-Verse. It was an absolutely phenomenal achievement in animation and a great follow-up to one of my personal favorite super-hero films. It's worth your time, with or without the Spider-Man 2 gameplay tease.\nThe post There’s some new Spider-Man 2 footage in Across the Spider-Verse appeared first on Destructoid.",

Go!\nApogee Entertainment and New Blood Interactive have announced that a release date has been nailed down for Nightdive Studios Rise of the Triad: Ludicrous Edition. It’s set to launch on PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC on July 31, 2023.\nOriginally intended to be a sequel to 1992’s seminal FPS, Wolfenstein 3D, Rise of the Triad absolutely pushed the game’s engine as far as it could go. I’m more of a fan of Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold, but it’s hard not to appreciate Rise of the Triad’s insane attention to detail. Tom Hall and the developers at Apogee went completely nuts with this one, ensuring that it’s memorable for its over-the-top nature.\nhttps://youtu.be/OqDedfEgprs\nI remember playing it on my cousin’s computer and having him point out the small details. Heatseeking missiles, for example, would home in on torches if there weren’t any enemies present. It would be greatly overshadowed by the release of Doom the previous year. However, Rise of the Triad manages to stand apart as an infectiously enjoyable romp.\nIt’s in good hands with Nightdive Studios. They’ve made the effort to transport the game into their fantastic proprietary KEX Engine. Rise of the Triad: Ludicrous Edition supports all the “modern creature comforts” of 4K resolution (where supported), 60FPS framerate, and 11-player deathmatches. There’s also a brand new episode, a level creator, the expansion packs included, and restored content from the betas.\nHeck. Yes.\nRise of the Triad: Ludicrous Edition comes to PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC on July 31, 2023. You can try it out right now, as a demo has just dropped on Steam (Oops!

And the black-and-green brand is promising to show off a whole host of titles, most of which will be sporting \"in-engine\" footage.\n\"None of our first-party games in the show are full CG trailers,\" said Xbox VP of Gaming Aaron Greenberg on Twitter. \"Everything is either in-game footage, in-engine footage, or in-game footage with some cinematics. Each of our trailers will be labeled so it is hopefully clear for our fans.\"\nhttps://twitter.com/aarongreenberg/status/1665503326853648387?s=20\nWhile Greenberg was simply replying to a fan's query, it should be noted that the comments are, ironically, a stark contrast to PlayStation's State of Play presentation from May, which featured over an hour of wall-to-wall trailers and reveals, but leaned heavily on cinematic sequences, showing little actual gameplay for a lot of its most-exciting titles.\nMore directly, however, Greenberg says that the Xbox Games Showcase will feature \"no movie trailers\", which is a clear tongue-in-cheek reference to Sony spotlighting the upcoming Gran Turismo film during its stream. A funny gag for sure, but to be fair if I was Sony putting together a summer showcase, why wouldnt't you promote the film based on one of your biggest and most lucrative brands?\nAnywhoo, the Xbox Games Showcase takes place June 11 at 10:00 PT / 13:00 ET / 18:00 BST.

The denouement and climax are rolled together sloppily in a single character just standing in a room. I’ve seen rushed games before, but I have never seen one that just nosedives from really good to barely a game in what feels like mere moments.\nhttps://twitter.com/AspyrMedia/status/1664784147867480070?s=20\nThe Restored Content DLC was supposed to take all the cut content that couldn’t be compiled into the “finished” product and assemble it in a way that the developers at Obsidian intended. There are fan-compiled mods for the PC version you can use to get a more complete experience, but it looks like the console version is just going to have to remain in an incomplete state.\nWhat game should you get instead of the KOTOR 2 DLC?\nSince there’s the possibility that people bought Knights of the Old Republic 2 on Switch specifically for the chance to play the Restored Content (and I know that there are some), Aspyr is offering a “complimentary” key for anyone who purchased before the announcement. Might I suggest Star Wars: Episode 1 Racer? It is way better than it sounds.\nTo get your complimentary key, simply visit support.aspyr.com and submit a request along with proof of purchase. Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2: The Sith Lords is currently available for purchase on Nintendo Switch and PC.\nThe post Aspyr apologizes for cancellation of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2 Restored Content DLC appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Mods 'n' Horrors\nAny horror fans casting their minds back will fondly remember Frictional Games' Amnesia: The Dark Descent. Released in 2010, this indie survival horror title quickly became one of the most terrifying games of its era. Now, the developer has announced that modding for it just became a lot easier through the Steam Workshop.\nIn a recent post on the Amnesia page, Frictional has said that in anticipation of Amnesia: The Bunker, which is due out in just a couple of days, the team decided to enable the publishing of custom mods via Steam. The studio acknowledges that modding has become a huge part of the community. Places like Nexus Mods have been a great source of new content, but now there's a new repository to get your modifications for Dark Descent.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOhvfP5aEXU\nWhile survival horror has always been around, it was the first Amnesia release that really shook things up. By introducing a mechanic that makes it impossible to defend yourself, the game became a test of mettle. Along with Minecraft, it pretty much birthed the early days of the YouTube Let's Play video, as fans would challenge themselves to see how far they could get before becoming too scared.\nSince then, there have been additional entries in the series, but none could quite match the unbridled terror of the OG. There may never be anything quite like Amnesia: The Dark Descent again, but with The Bunker coming to Xbox Games Pass, there's going to be plenty of horror fans who will be excited about the new game.\nThe post Amnesia: The Dark Descent now supports Steam Workshop appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "No More Secrets\nGrasshopper Manufacture, the studio founded by esoteric game designer Suda51, is teasing some sort of announcement for June 15, which is the date that its online countdown clock hits Terminus.\nWhile the clock was first started back in March (on the anniversary of No More Heroes, no less), fan @Knoebelbroet spotted that it had recently been updated with a new design, as well as offering a new and definitive date for the mysterious reveal. The timing would suggest that the reveal was initially set to take place during this week's Summer Game Fest event, but has now been delayed to the following week.\nhttps://twitter.com/Knoebelbroet/status/1665599011389054978?s=20\nSo, what is it? Well, the fact that the clock launched on No More Heroes' anniversary could suggest a new entry in Suda51's lurid action-adventure series. That said, there have been whispers that the studio has been working on a new title for some years now — A video shot at the studio itself last year showed an artist working on a grotesque boss character, leading some to believe a new Shadows of the Damned might be in the works. Although it's been a while since we heard anything of the Lollipop Chainsaw remake, Suda51 and his current staff are not involved with that project, so it is unlikely to pertain to that game.\nWhatever the ultimate reveal turns out to be, all of the prospects are pretty exciting. And, thankfully, we won't have to wait too much longer to find out the truth. We will, of course, bring you all of the details from the June 15 Grasshopper Manufacture reveal right here on Destructoid.\nUntil then, however, let the speculation commence.\nThe post Suda 51’s Grasshopper Manufacture is teasing something for June 15 appeared first on Destructoid.",

According to Nakayama, this figures brings the series total \"players\" to over 50 million. Given that the most recent recorded data suggests that the series sits around 49 million lifetime sales, we can likely make the fair adaptation of \"players\" to \"sales\".\nhttps://twitter.com…",

There are plenty of bad movies intentionally made to be fun to watch. Digital marketplaces are full of bad games made badly and good games made poorly, but creating a game that is intended to reflect bad design but is actually fun to play; that takes work.\nHowever, with the emerging sub-genre that I like to call jank-pop, there have been better examples of it. Cruelty Squad, for example, features eye-piercingly garish colors and spaghetti-nest level design, but it winds up being fun to play with its dark but off-kilter sense of humor and deep (sometimes unintentionally broken) mechanics.\nSome people take Cruelty Squad way too seriously.

Much like its predecessor, Tetris The Grand Master, TGM2 is an expert-level iteration of Alexey Pajitnov's classic block-busting puzzler, and tasks players with using adaptation and forward-thinking to manage a rapidly filling playfield of Tetrominos.\nCheck out a bout of TGM2 T.A. Death in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Masterjun3.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcjqNkiT8q0\nTGM2 retains the complex gameplay of its predecessor but adds a casual player-friendly \"Normal\" mode, as well as an evolved edition of \"Master\" mode, which features huge acceleration after level 500. Also part of the update is the incredibly challenging \"T.A. Death\" mode, which features fixes 20G gravity settings, as well as a consistently high speed from the get-go. It is considered one of the most difficult challenges in Tetris history. The arrival of TGM2, (and previously TGM), on the Arcade Archives plugs a gap that has been in the collections of Tetris fans the world over for generations.\nWell, at least in an official capacity...

It's coming out digitally and physically on June 30 for $29.99.\nhttps://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1664438932728168450\nAccording to the eShop description, you can use Joy-Con controllers or smart devices, with certain games only available in smart device mode.\nAs for what games you can play, there aren't a ton of details. There's everything from \"balloons to aliens,\" with a \"mix\" of games and modes. And also, whatever this horse-head guy is up to.\nPlayers can split up into teams and compete, seeing who can win a certain number of games first. There are also some variations to add more challenge or rules, too.\nSwitching it up\nWhile the actual announcement was a little out of the blue, we did hear about this sequel through a report last year. It was claimed to be in development, would include games like musical chairs and Bingo, and was also apparently not doing well in internal play-tests.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpHDJRGuL7w\nNow, at least, it seems like Nintendo is pushing this one out the door. Though it's not really getting the pomp and circumstance you'd expect for a new release. Either way, looks like Switch parties will have something new to do at the end of the month.\nIt's interesting that phones are playing a role too, as the original 1-2 Switch was a showcase for the Joy-Cons themselves.

          "description": "Rough timing as always, SNK\nSNK has announced that it will be holding an open beta next week in order to test out the rollback netcode update heading toward its world-class punch-up The King of Fighters XIII Global Match. The beta will take place on PS4 from June 5 through to June 11.\nThe beta will allow all PS4 owners to check out an updated version of the excellent 2010 sequel, which is the final KoF title to date to feature 2D animation for its super-fast and highly intense gameplay. Several modes will be available to all, including Practice Lobby, Online Vs. and Customization. Over the course of the six-day beta, SNK will be gathering data to analyze how well the new netcode is sitting.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCJjObBRrk4\nIt's marvelous that KoF XIII is getting the upgrade, as it is truly one of SNK's greatest releases of all time, and fully deserving a life within this generation and the next. It's frustrating that, as they always seem to do, SNK has picked an odd time to run this King of Fighters XIII beta, literally days after the launch of Capcom's Street Fighter 6. But regardless, this is good news for the KoF faithful, and here's hoping that the love for KoF XIII can prevail in both the online and competitive markets.\nKing of Fighters XIII Global Match is available now on PC. It is coming to PS4 and Nintendo Switch in the near future.\nThe post King of Fighters XIII Global Match Online beta to be held next week appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's understandable, fighting games are not easy. In fact, they're one of the hardest and most skillful genres in the whole of gaming. Always have been.\nVictory isn't a matter of learning the biggest combo and performing it over and over again. It's a long road of building upon yourself, learning the intricacies of the characters, learning what to do, and — equally as important — when, where, and why to do it. But while I will never claim to be a fighting game expert, I can at least help you to start finding your feet, and the rest is up to you and your patience.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watc…",

          "description": "Retrofashionistio\nWhile nobody would deny that the 18-strong roster of Street Fighter 6 is pretty damn slick-looking, everyone loves a bit of variety in the wardrobe — As such Capcom has released a new trailer showing shown off each of the World Warrior's alternate costumes.\nAs you can see, returning characters receive their classic skins, from Ryu & Ken's legendary karate Gis to Chun-Li extravagant... erm... Interpol Uniform. Cammy is sure to turn heads in her borderline obscene battle suit, while Juri gets her biker gear back, albeit missing the black undershirt. Damn, Capcom were feeling particularly thirsty with this release.\nFor the newcomers, Marisa has an incredible cream suit reminiscent of Like a Dragon's Kazuma Kiryu, while Manon simply stuns in an haute couture deal fresh from the streets of Paris. \"Drip\", or something. Of all the characters, Dee Jay Maximum perhaps pulls the biggest switcheroo, as his classic Super Street Fighter II gear makes him look like an entirely different character! All in, everyone looks pretty rad.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNKO77QDCN4\nHow to unlock the Street Fighter 6 alt costumes\nSo, how do you bag these skins? Well, they can be purchased from the in-game store for 50 Fighter Coins each to 2500 Drive Tickets (this includes all color variants). They can be unlocked by playing through World Tour and maxing out your personal bond with the respective characters. Once the bond hits 100, then the character's outfit (complete with the color variants) unlocks for use in Arcade, Vs., and other one-on-one modes.\nNo doubt, as Capcom is wont to do, the cast will receive a huge array of additional DLC costumes as SF6 passes through its lifespan, to be purchased via Fighter Coins and/or Drive Tickets.\nStreet Fighter 6 is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post Street Fighter 6 shows off its launch roster’s alt costumes appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "You don't need to play 2020's Final Fantasy VII Remake to enjoy its sequel, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, according to the game's co-director Motuma Toriyama. \nLast week, Square Enix and the official Final Fantasy VII Twitter account began releasing new details about the upcoming sequel, answering one question each day. On day one, we learned Rebirth is \"progressing smoothly.\" Day 2 and Day 3 were less exciting, teasing that players will have a \"high degree of freedom, experiencing a myriad of different stories\" and that players \"will witness a chain of narrative events that lie at the very heart of the Final Fantasy VII story.\" \nFor Day 4, the question is: Do I need to play Final Fantasy VII Remake to enjoy Final Fantasy VII Rebirth? And here's Toriyama's answer: \"No – we have made preparations so that players who did not get a chance to play the first game can fully enjoy Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.\" \nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth\n#FF7R pic.twitter.com/vsmJZvDljw\nJune 5, 2023\nIf I had to guess, Rebirth will feature an introductory cutscene or minimovie that summarizes the events of the first game but only time will tell.\nRebirth is slated to release this winter, although an official release date has not yet been revealed. Considering it's Final Fantasy \"7,\" many are speculating that Square Enix's daily QA will end on Day 7, which would be this Thursday, June 8. That's also the same day Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest presentation will air so perhaps we'll be seeing some footage of Rebirth during that, or at least maybe learning when we can play this game.\nFor more, check out Game Informer's June Summer Game Fest 2023 schedule, and then read our Final Fantasy VII Remake review to find out why you probably should play it before Rebirth.

Greenberg tweeted this in response to someone poking fun at showcase tendencies to rely heavily on CGI trailers. \nNone of our first party games in the show are full CG trailers. Everything is either in-game footage, in-engine footage, or in-game footage with some cinematics.

          "description": "Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the second chapter of the planned Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy of games, received a brief but welcomed progress report from producer Yoshinori Kitase. Though we haven’t heard a peep about the game since its reveal last June, we could be getting a release date soon. \nIn a tweet, Kitase answered the question of how Rebirth is progressing by simply stating, “Development is progressing smoothly and according to plan. We are currently working on nailing down a release date for the game.” \nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth\npic.twitter.com/O4KdGlh4gy\nJune 2, 2023\nWhile not much, the update is an exciting one if things are going as well as Kitase claims. As for when we could hear about a launch date, Summer Game Fest is around the corner, and Square Enix is one of the confirmed partners for the event, so there's a small chance Rebirth will make an appearance. \nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth is currently slated to release this winter for PlayStation 5 and picks up after the events of Final Fantasy VII Remake and its Intermission story expansion. Though it follows Cloud and Co.’s journey beyond Midgar, the cinematic reveal trailer makes it tough to know what to expect given Remake's events (other than Cloud and Sephiroth taking a lot of strolls together), so hopefully, we'll be getting another glimpse of the project sooner than later. \nFor more, be sure to read our reviews of Final Fantasy VII Remake and the Intermission expansion in the Intergrade version. Square Enix is also gearing up to launch Final Fantasy XVI on June 22, which graces Game Informer's cover this month.

The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey. \nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

Nintendo's description of the game says players can split into teams \"and see which group can win a certain number of games first,\" while also noting that many of the games have several variations that change the rules or add extra challenge. \nEverybody 1-2-Switch hits Switch on June 30. Both the physical and digital edition will cost $29.99. \nWhile this is a surprise official announcement from Nintendo, this isn't the first time we've heard of Everybody 1-2-Switch. Former Game Informer and Fanbyte editor Imran Khan wrote a report while at Fanbyte about this sequel. In that report, Khan spoke to several sources who said the game was complete but unannounced because of how badly it was testing. Nintendo didn't know what to do with the game, with many fearing releasing it in its current state could harm the company's reputation for releasing great games. \nIt's unclear what's changed between that report and now – perhaps nothing has changed and Nintendo is using the excitement around The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom to quietly release Everybody 1-2-Switch. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don't have to wait long because Everybody 1-2-Switch hits Switch on June 30. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's review of 1-2-Switch. \nAre you picking up Everybody 1-2-Switch?

Prosecutors also demanded that Naka pay a fine of 2.5 million yen (roughly $17,900) as well as a supplementary penalty of 170 million yen (roughly $1.2 million). Naka's defense asked that this fine and prison sentence be reduced, but a final decision on the matter isn't expected until July 7, VGC reports. \nNaka, who also directed Balan Wonderworld, was arrested in November in connection to an insider trading investigation involving the reveal of a new Dragon Quest game. Naka was accused of purchasing 10,000 shares worth 2.8 million yen (roughly $20,000) in Aiming, the company behind the new mobile Dragon Quest game. \nThen, less than a month later, Naka was re-arrested on a second charge of insider trading, this time involving the now-defunct mobile battle royale, Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier. Naka reportedly purchased 120,000 shares in Ateam, the developer behind the game, for approximately 144.7 million yen (more than $1 million). \nNow, Naka has been charged and could face more than two and a half years in prison alongside more than $1 million in fines. A final decision on his charges is expected next month. \n[Source: Abema Times via VGC]",

It’s an interesting aspect of this story because it speaks to how broad its horizons might be. What starts as a revenge story will grow into one of war, its effects on people, and ultimately, Valisthea’s place in a fight between Eikons, Dominants, and more over crystals. \nIt also means we’ll be seeing a lot of Clive’s life. During my cover story trip, I played a few of FFXVI’s opening hours, much of which took place in the past, when Clive is just 15 and his younger brother Joshua even younger. I learned a lot about their relationship with each other as well as with their parents, and more I won’t spoil here. But I also flashe…",

          "description": "For a licensed racing game, 2021’s Hot Wheels Unleashed was a fun and respectable debut, and now we’ll get to see how developer Milestone builds on that foundation with an upcoming sequel. \nHot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged arrives on October 19 and retains the fun “little toy car in a big world” presentation with new additions under the hood. Players can now get behind the wheel of motorcycles and ATVs, and the game has over 130 vehicles total at launch.\nPlayers race across five diverse environments using new skills: double jumping and lateral dashing. The double jump can be performed at any time to leap over rivals and obstacles, while dashing is great for sideswiping nearby opponents or dodging hazards. Milestone touts increased interactivity between vehicles and objects on and off the track, and playstyles can be customized using perks earned by earning skill points. \n\n\nModes include a revamped story-driven campaign starring four original characters, complete with animated cutscenes. Other challenges include events designed to test players’ skills such as drifting and evading crashes. For online multiplayer, the game supports cross-play (except on Switch), and players can now create friend parties. Local two-player splitscreen also makes a return. \nThe popular creation suite from the first game now features a refined Track Editor with expanded features and a Livery Editor update introducing the Sticker Editor to create and save custom patterns and shapes. Best of all, all user-generated content will be sharable cross-platform at launch, though it's unclear if any player-made content from the original can be imported into this game. \nHot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. Check out some of the sequel's cars in the screenshot gallery below.",

It seems one might be on the way. \nAccording to a new report on Sudbury.com, a news organization that covers the Greater Sudbury area in Canada, which is where Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City was filmed, Sudbury is receiving an $11 million injection from the provincial government, as reported by PCGamesN. This government is funding 20 local projects through the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund Corporation and while a sequel to Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City hasn't officially been named as one of those 20 projects, there is one called \"Umbrella Chronicles,\" and it's receiving $2 million. \nIf you're familiar with the Resident Evil series, you know \"Umbrella Chronicles\" is likely a nod to The Umbrella Chronicles spinoff game. Add in that the film company behind \"Umbrella Chronicles\" is Raccoon HG Film Productions, the same company behind Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City, and the picture gets a little clearer: we might be getting a sequel. \nIt's important to note this isn't an official confirmation of a sequel. Perhaps Raccoon HG Film Productions is making a different Resident Evil movie unattached to Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City. Only time will tell. \nIn the meantime, watch our interview with two of the 2021 film's stars and then check out this featurette from Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City with some behind-the-scenes details. \n[Source: Sudbury.com via PCGamesN]\nDo you want a sequel to Resident Evil: Welcome To Raccoon City?

Today, Genvid broke its silence by not only giving us new details on the series but also a trailer.\nIn this series, which will unfold simultaneously across the globe, those watching can help decide the fates of Ascension's main characters. This means that as the story plays out, the audience will have a say in who survives the surely horrific story, who will be redeemed or damned by their actions, and who will suffer the almost certainly ghastly consequences. According to Genvid Entertainment, not even the developers will know the results of the story until it unfolds.\nSilent Hill: Ascension features an ensemble of new characters, monsters, and locations within the Silent Hill universe. Genvid has crafted a real-time interactive system that allows viewers from around the world to decide these characters' fates within the narrative the studio has crafted. Beginning later in 2023, fans can tune in to live story moments where each day is different based on audience interactions. \nSilent Hill: Ascension is set to stream later this year.

          "description": "Final Fantasy XVI’s combat is fast, chaotic, and, most importantly, fun. There are plenty of combos to pull off, and in just the small taste of the action during my cover story trip to Square Enix’s Tokyo, Japan, office, I saw so much variance in setting up Clive’s combative abilities that I can’t wait to see what others do in-game. \nI also watched combat director Ryota Suzuki play through some of the most challenging encounters in the game, and unsurprisingly, he excelled, taking maybe one or two hits in the 20 minutes he played. He used combos I didn’t really comprehend – admittedly, he was playing at a much later portion of the game than I had hands-on access with – and it got me thinking: is he excited to see what players do with FFXVI’s combat, much like I was sitting there watching him pull off intricate combos against myriad enemies? \n“I’ve always tried to give players a lot of freedom when it comes to the controls and the action in the game, and give them lots of options that they can take and then do their own thing with,” Suzuki tells me. “So I’m expecting that there’s going to be a lot of weird things that they’re going to do with certain abilities. I can’t say what those abilities are, but I already have a few ideas because I’ve left a lot of things open-ended in that way. \n“I’m really excited to see what players will do with them because there are definitely things that I didn’t expect, but I do like putting that stuff out there so that they have stuff to play with and surprise me with. When they do things I expected, I’m happy, but I’m also really happy when they [...] do something that is completely unexpected. It’s one of the exciting things about being a developer.”\nLike Suzuki, I look forward to seeing what far more advanced players do with FFXVI’s combat, and fortunately, we have less than a month to go. \nFor more, be sure to check out Game Informer’s exclusive FFXVI coverage hub by clicking the banner below.",

          "description": "Robosen Robotics has for some years fostered a fun partnership with Hasbro and its Transformers license, including an awesome fully transformable Generation 1 Optimus Prime that would change between robot and truck on its own.\nIn a similar spirit, the same team now has a new robotic collectible coming to market, this time emulating the Optimus Prime character as he appears in the new Rise of the Beasts live-action film. Instead of full transformation like the previous G1-style incarnation, this new collectible is built as a display piece that can shift between various aerial action poses, speak lines of dialogue, and respond to voice and app commands from your phone or other device.\nThe figure features 21 precision servo motors and 69 microchips. Even before mounting on his included stand, Prime stands at 16 inches tall.\nThe team even brought in legendary voice actor Peter Cullen to reprise his role and record brand-new lines for the character to spout.\nThe new Rise of the Beasts Optimus Prime limited edition collectible will put you back a hefty sum; it’s currently on a preorder sale of $699 (instead of the regular price of $899). If that's not too high a price for controlling an intergalactic hero, he's all yours. The vaunted Aubobot leader will be ready to head out on a mission to your home in the fourth quarter of 2023.",

          "description": "Final Fantasy XVI is the most action-forward game in the mainline series’ history, and while it’s been a point of contention between players excited for this and fans of the franchise who yearn for something turn-based, it’s hard to deny the combat looks flashy and fun. And as someone who’s played a few hours of the game, I can say it is. \nWhile I attribute most of that to how great it feels to control Clive, it turns out there might be some tricks developer Creative Business Unit III learned developing Final Fantasy XIV’s action to make FFXVI’s combat feel even more satisfying beyond the actual gameplay. \n“For example, in boss battles, when you have an attack and you may see certain areas on the ground that light up to show that’s where the attack’s going to be, that’s something you might…",

The primary focus of FFXVI will be playing through Clive’s story and all it entails, but there’s more to the game than just the main scenario. \nI was curious about how players will get around Valisthea, especially with developer Creative Business Unit III at the helm. In its MMO, Final Fantasy XIV, mounts are abundant. You can ride chocobos, the Regalia from Final Fantasy XV, Magitek armor, and more. There are dozens of mounts to acquire in-game, and I wondered if that would bleed over into FFXVI. \n“To tell you the truth, it’s pretty much just chocobos,” FFXVI director Hiroshi Takai tells me. “In past Final Fantasy games, you’d have canoes or boats or …",

          "description": "The latest Pokémon Trading Card Game expansion, Scarlet & Violet – Paldea Evolved, arrives next month. As the name implies, this new version delivers plenty of evolved forms of Paldean Pokémon while expanding on the pre-existing catalog of Paldean and non-Paldean monsters.\nThis second expansion in the Scarlet & Violet series of cards brings with it more than 190 new cards, including 15 Pokémon ex cards, Tera Pokémon ex cards with a crystalline appearance, more than 30 Trainer cards, and dozens of Pokémon and Trainer cards with special illustrations. The Pokémon Company sent over several booster packs for us to open and see what we could pull, and those with the special illustrations ended up being the highlight of my pack-opening experience.\nYou can see my favorite of the cards I pulled in the gallery below.\n\nI was pretty happy with the cards I pulled from the packs. My favorite is probably the special Elite Trainer Box Pikachu card, which features the three Paldean starters in the background, though I also love the Pikachu I pulled from a booster pack. Outside of that, I enjoyed seeing the various Paldean starters' evolved forms, though, for some reason, my pulls skewed heavily toward Quaxly's evolution line. Outside of this most recent generation of Pokémon, I was happy to snag some updated cards of old favorites, such as Gyarados, Raichu, and Tyranitar.\nIn addition to being the second Pokémon Trading Card Game to bear the Scarlet & Violet name, it's also the second pack to come at a higher price tag. However, The Pokémon Company has at least tried to deliver some benefits to this, as each pack includes more foils, and even the wrapper of each booster pack feels thicker and of higher quality than the original Scarlet & Violet expansion.\nPokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet – Paldea Evolved arrives on June 9.
