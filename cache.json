          "description": "Contrasaur.\nWayForward Technologies has made a name for itself as one of the best developers out there when it comes to retro-flavoured projects, from their excellent beat-em-ups like Double Dragon Neon and River City Girls to Metroidvanias like The Mummy Demastered and its signature Shantae series. The studio excels at that throwback style and 2007’s Contra 4 was a particularly fine example, reviving a Konami series which had been stagnating since the original PlayStation era. While Contra 4 was well-received, WayForward never got another shot at a Contra game, so in 2019 the developer decided to go build its own Contra, with dinosaurs, and spiders.\nReleased originally as a launch title for Apple Arcade, Spidersaurs is a run-and-gun shooter in which you take part as a combat intern at INGEST Corp — a food manufacturer that has created dinosaur and insect hybrids in an attempt to solve world hunger. As with most fictional attempts to bring back dinosaurs like Jurassic Park or Billy and the Cloneasaurus, the titular creatures escape and it’s up to you to stop them (and eat them).\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Dream a little dream of me.\nThe fifth console generation represented arguably the greatest shift in game design the industry has ever seen, as developers all over the world wrestled with how to transition 2D tenets into the 3D realm. There was lots of experimentation, and while platformers like Super Mario 64 and Spyro dived head-first into the new dimension, others like Crash Bandicoot tethered the camera and still kept a lot of 2D design at the forefront. Launching on PS1 in 1997, Klonoa: Door to Phantomile — which was remade in 2008 on Wii — fell more in this latter camp, and though it seemed that Namco had largely abandoned the loveable Dream Traveler, he’s been given another shot with Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series. This remake of the first game and its sequel, 2001's Lunatea's Veil for PS2, is little more than a fresh coat of HD paint, but the two classics here still hold up as excellent platformers that no fan of the genre will want to miss.\nThe story of Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series places you in the role of the titular cat-rabbit Klonoa, a “Dream Traveler” whose role is venturing to worlds within people’s dreams to help bring about balance and peace. Along the way, you’re aided in this journey by local residents of the dream worlds and take on a small handful of silly antagonists who wish to fill the world with nightmares.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Well, it turns out that music is a pretty safe bet, as the publisher has showcased another track from the game's original score, titled 'Millick Meadows'.\nIt's unclear exactly where in the game such a track will commence, but since there's an area in the game known as Millick Meadows, we're willing to bet that this music will be the accompanying track - duh, right?

After its meteoric rise in 2021, sales of NFTs have since levelled off and may in fact be in a bit of a decline, though that hasn't stopped the likes of GameStop entering the space with its own NFT marketplace. In even more bizarre news, a Web 3 company known as Polium introduced the \"world's first\" NFT console, making us question the direction of human evolution.\nDespite the ongoing popularity of NFTs within certain communities, it's clear that more and more people are coming out of the woodwork to denounce the concept altogether. At the recent International Games Festival in Brazil, one dev actually managed to give an entire talk on why NFTs are \"a nightmare\", despite the fact that the event was being sponsored by a number of NFT and blockchain companies.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The 1TB and 2TB models – both capacious enough to act as your PC’s sole storage drive – have Prime-exclusive savings on Amazon UK, with the 1TB SN570 a few quid cheaper than it was during last year’s Black Friday sales.\r\n\n \nRead more",

That means some prices are back to normal, some aren’t, and the entire concept of a deal becomes kind of nebulous and squishy. And yet, there will undoubtedly be people out there desperate for a new graphics card – any new graphics card – so let’s take a look at what’s out there.\r\n\n\r\nThe bad news is that the vast majority of Prime Day GPU “deals” still reach above the respective card’s original retail price. The good news is that I’ve found a small handful of offers that are, if nothing else, good value by the incredibly whacked-out standards of the past two years. First up, there are a couple of Nvidia GeForce RTX 30 series cards worth considering in the UK, including an MSI-made RTX 3070 (that Ebuyer have price matched). Sticking with RTX cards, which can run both DLSS and DLAA, GameStop have a reasonable RTX 3060 deal for US buyers.\r\n\n \nRead more",

You do not need to prize open your powerwasher with a tri-wing screwdriver or manage your finances via a convoluted banking app or determine whether a kitchen sink delivers enough pressure. Instead, you wash things with power: you power wash. You wash, powerfully.\nAfter a year in early access, the game's launching in full with a variety of modes and I cannot stress enough how stress-less the experience is.

Cheap new peripherals/monitors/SSDs/other gubbins can still be yours, as plenty of other retailers are running sales this week to give Prime Day some healthy competition. In some cases they’ll even have the same kit as Amazon but at a matching or even better prices. Thus, this list, which gathers together all of the best anti-Prime Day deals I’ve found.\nRead more",

          "description": "I have long been on the \"eh, seems okay\" side of the fence regarding Valve's newest lil child. To me, the Steam Deck did not do anything not already covered by the four different video game boxes I already own. The largest advantage afforded by the Steam Deck, the ability to play cool games on a handheld device, was surely the domain of the Nintendo Switch - a console that I personally use about once a year. Usually the process is that I go \"Oh yeah!\", pick up the Switch, and contemplate buying Breath Of The Wild before I see that it has not depreciated in value whatsoever since it came out five years ago. Then I turn off the Switch. \nLast week, though, I picked up the Switch, saw that Tangle Tower was on sale, and played it through in one go. \"This is great!\", I thought, marvelling at how I could play a game while sitting on the sofa, but leaving the TV free for my partner to watch whatever stupid TV show he wanted. I went to look for other cool indie games that might be on sale on the Switch, and that's when I discovered that the Switch eshop is hot garbage unless you know specifically what you're looking for. So now I want a Switch.\nRead more",

But hey, if you missed it, the zombie shooter still one of the best co-op games, so grab it while you can.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Earlier this week, I had a real blast from the past moment. Apparently, my ancient LiveJournal turned 18 on Tuesday, a thing I haven't posted in or given a single thought to for at least ten years. Naturally, curiosity got the better of me, so I dipped my toe back in to see what teenage Katharine had been blogging about in the mid to late 00s. Aside from all my custom images having been eaten, probably with the closure of whatever photo upload service I used back in the day, everything else was pretty much in tact. \nBut man alive. Those OPINIONS. Just terrible. Bad, awful, narrow-minded. In some ways it's quite funny looking back at how angry I was about Nintendo putting trains in a Zelda game, for example (joke's on me, Spirit Tracks would go on to become one of my fav Zelda games of all time), but in many ways I'm just quite glad I've (hopefully) moved on as a person, if only because recent weeks have reminded me there are still plenty of people out there like late 00s Katharine who are in all likelihood the same age I am now. Yes, I'm talking about the backlash to Return Of Monkey Island.\nRead more",

With Lost Nova on my back burner I shrugged, and gave that a go, having frankly forgotten what it was.\nIt's a gathering game, so almost the reverse of gardening, or perhaps the end point of it. But its relaxed pace, warm tone, and fun dialogue were, it turns out, exactly what I needed. There's no pressure, and not too much to worry about. You can just wander about enjoying the vibe and digging things up with your gentle laser as you go.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Madison is a fun game to write about. It's a puzzle horror game set in your traditional haunted house, aiming at a P.T. or Layers Of Fear vibe down the viewfinder of a Polaroid camera. Said camera was a second-hand gift for Luca's (that's you!) 16th birthday. It is also possessed by a demon, which is where the fun comes in, \"fun\" here meaning jump scares and hallucinatory clocks. Let that be a lesson to anyone thinking of getting their son something that was evidence in a murder as a present. This is one of many bad choices characters in Madison made. They are mostly now dead.\nThe game itself sometimes makes very good choices, though it's about 50/50 that it goes a bit too weird and ends up being silly. This makes for an intriguing mixture, especially with a complicated story of murder and neglect spanning decades, and by the end I was extremely fond of the way the sublime and the ridiculous sat side by side. The main let down isn't that Madison sometimes makes you giggle by accident, but that its multi-stage puzzles become so drawn out that you stop jumping at creepy angels and terrifying violin squeals. You've got numbers to write down and candles to move, and you don't have time for any demonic antics right now, godammit.\nRead more",

In my memory of it, I was an adolescent, which was categorically not the case and probably more a product of the booths at Gamescom being very tall, not to mention the hands on taking place so very long ago. At that time, the game was essentially the naval combat bit from AC: Black Flag, carved out and extended to be its own thing. Now, years later and with many delays and reworks bobbing about in its wake, Skull And Bones is back, and looking a bit different.\nThe current state of play for Skull And Bones was revealed with a livestream tonight, featuring an explainer video walking you through some of the game features, a chonk of the game in piratical action, and a surprisingly close release date confirmation for the 8th of November 2022 (there's still time for it to be delayed again!). All those extra months in the oven have produced a decidedly Sea Of Thieves-shaped bun. But this one is all realistic and gritty, more complicated, and is taking itself seriously. You won't catch Skull And Bones announcing its new season features with a comedy song, that's for sure.\nRead more",

Origins was one of the reasons I got into PC gaming, because my dinky laptop wasn't good enough to run it and I was desperate to play it after seeing the trailers. I spaffed some of my student loan on a new desktop and spent four months eating nothing but cheese sandwiches. At the time it felt worth it. Watching those trailers now is like opening a time capsule full of fantasy tropes and, for some reason, an incongruous chugging guitar song by someone we don't need to mention ever again.\nReplaying it now is a different experience. It's still a really cool RPG, notable for very good world-building and a cast of interesting characters (that you can have sex with in a cold tent), and it continues to hold a dear place in my heart. On the other hand, there's a whole section that's such a mind-numbing slog to get through that everyone hates it and there's a mod specifically to remove it from the entire game. Origins is a game I very much like, yet sometimes struggle to explain why it is good. But I'm not alone in thinking so, 'cos in 2009 this was RPS's Game Of The Year. Can't blame me for that. I didn't even work here then.\nRead more",

Komentuje to jednoduše: situace s X11 se nijak nelepší a Wayland je již široce podporován. Emmanuele Bassi v zásadě souhlasí, X11 už nedostává žádnou novou funkcionalitu a framework GTK se již delší dobu architektonicky posouvá směrem k Waylandu, jeho API se tak běhu na X11 stále vzdaluje. Dodává také, že řeči jsou jedna věc, ale pokud kód [podpory X11] nikdo nenapíše, tak prostě nebude.",

          "description": "We heard you like Doom\nThere's a fascination online with getting classic 1993 FPS Doom running on just about anything. On other consoles, on hardware, on anything that can handle and output data. And now, we've gone one layer deeper, as one modder has put Doom inside Doom.\nYouTube modder kgsws uploaded a video titled \"You can run Doom inside (DOS) Doom, for real.\" earlier this week. (Thanks, PCGamesN.) In it, they show the process of using code injection inside the DOS version of Doom.\nNow, game and code injection is something they've toyed with before now. But the ultimate execution that leads to Doom running inside Doom is impressive to see.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6hnQ1RKhbo\nAfter a lengthy process, kgsws is able to make a wall as a designated Doom-space. Here, they can watch the attract mode play out, or take over the controls and play themselves.\nEventually, kgsws builds even more. There's a theater for the Doom-ception, but also some additional switches to toggle in-game effects. The modder even puts Heretic, another classic retro shooter, inside Doom.\n\nThe ultimate Doom-ception\nThe quest to make Doom playable on just about anything and everything is, at times, awe-inspiring. It's one thing to get Doom running on a machine meant to play games, like a Game and Watch or something.\nBut then you have the wilder stuff. People putting Doom in their brand-new Porsche. Doom inside of Twitter, proving the site truly is a hellscape after all. Or Doom inside a pregnancy test, just because we can.\nAt this point, what's left to get Doom running on? I don't know, and in some ways I'm terrified to find out. But Doom truly is eternal, it seems. Anyways, if you want to play Doom more conventionally, the ports for modern consoles sound like they've got some nice quality-of-life improvements and features.\nThe post Modder puts Doom inside of Doom appeared first on Destructoid.",

While it was already a given that The Last of Us would be arriving at some point next year, Bloys' comment brings its premiere date closer still, which will come as something of a relief for impatient fans, (see: all fans of everything).\nSpeaking of dates, Naughty Dog itself has noted that upcoming remake The Last of Us Part I has now officially gone gold, with code ready to be pressed to discs and sent whizzing out over the airways — affording the community yet another opportunity to experience the critically acclaimed stealth adventure all over again. It's been quite a speedy turnaround from official reveal to shelf date and, despite being the third rerelease in less than a decade, it's sure to be a guaranteed smash seller.\nThe Last of Us is scheduled to premiere on HBO in 2023. The Last of Us Part I will launch on PS5 September 2.

If you're curious, the date is at the very end! It feels like it would have been a classic Nintendo Direct info drop, but here it is on a random Wednesday morning.\nWe also have brand new info from Nintendo beyond the Bayonetta 3 release date, with a few key story implications. There will be a \"coven of Bayonetta,\" with \"each [member] more fabulous than the last,\" with settings that include Tokyo (as we've seen in the past), as well as the mountainsides of China (and \"beyond\"). We'll also get to play a \"witch-in-training\" named Viola, a sword-wielder, and she's accompanied by Chesire, a cat companion. Major Devil May Cry 3 vibes with the Nero and Viola parallels!\nhttps://twitter.com/NintendoEurope/status/1547205510843301888\nNintendo has additionally shown off the \"Trinity Masquerade Edition,\" which will be at \"select retailers,\" and will provide a 200 page color art book, on top of three reversible game cases for each entry of the series on Switch. \"More details will be revealed in the future,\" and hopefully that process isn't as rough as the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 special edition.\nOh, and the original Bayonetta is out as a standalone physical release on September 30, with a \"limited number\" run. It's priced at $30.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6a5-8_kt3E\n[Update: Platinum has separately revealed a new filter called \"Naïve Angel Mode,\" which will change some outfits to be less revealing as an optional filter. It's a super interesting way to tackle these types of things, which platform holders are often in contention with.]\nhttps://twitter.com/platinumgames/status/1547216944470069248\nThe post Bayonetta 3 snags an October 28 release date, special edition detailed (Update) appeared first on Destructoid.",

And that includes this new beautiful Xenoblade Chronicles 3 song called \"A Life Sent On.\"\nShared by way of the Nintendo UK Twitter account, the track is described as a \"somber flute-based melody,\" which is played by \"off-seers\" in the universe (specifically Noah and Mio) to mourn people who have fallen in battle. Based on the small amount of lore we have, off-seers are tasked with some sort of guidance for a facet of the afterlife, and could potentially play a larger role in the narrative.\nFor now, I've listened to this particular Xenoblade Chronicles 3 song a bunch of times…",

          "description": "SNAAAAAAAAAKE!\nToday is the 35th anniversary of one of the most influential, genre-defining, and beloved franchises in video game history, Metal Gear. That's 35 years of crawling around in military bases, dodging spotlights, hiding in the backs of trucks and under boxes, and sitting through seemingly endless codec conversations about what date it is. And it's been one hell of a journey, I'm sure you'll agree.\nWhile Konami has not seen fit to do anything interesting with the license since series creator Hideo Kojima left the company, the publisher has announced that it is preparing to re-launch some of the series M.I.A. titles, that were discontinued from sale back in November 2021. At the time, Konami noted that there were licensing issues due to the use of real-life documentary footage in certain games, that the publisher was hoping to renew.\nIn a tweet posted earlier today, Konami noted that the delisted titles would be returning very soon, though it chose not to mention any of the specific games themselves by name. Is this all we will be seeing in regards to the iconic franchise's anniversary year? Quite possibly, while Konami is wont to hang on to the brand for obvious financial game, the studio seems increasingly uncomfortable with the idea of producing new titles with Kojima being a key player in the title's development. Happy anniversary, please buy these games again Kind of an anticlimatic anniversary.\nRegardless, here's to the 35th birthday of an undeniable, indelible, 100% genuine game-changer.\nhttps://twitter.com/metalgear_jp/status/1547023739371790336?s=20&t=gvi9sf_eB-lso8sCiJc73A\nThe post Delisted Metal Gear titles set to return for 35th anniversary appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "As well as an exclusive edition from iam8bit\nOne of the most intriguing games of the summer is an adventure starring a cat — being, well, a cat — in a human-less city. Stray releases digitally for PS4, PS5, and PC on July 19, but if you're looking to pick up a physical copy, that's coming later. You've got two options.\nThe most basic physical edition of Stray on PS4/PS5 is due on September 20, for $40, and there's also an iam8bit exclusive edition for $45 that's shipping in Q4 2022.\nAccording to iam8bit, pre-orders for the standard retail edition of Stray will \"start to open up this week,\" so keep an eye on your preferred retailer. The exclusive edition, however, is up for grabs today with no deadline to worry about yet — it's an \"open pre-order.\"\nHere's what comes in the (slightly pricier) box:\n[caption id=\"attachment_334617\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1365\"] The physical Exclusive Edition of Stray for PS4/PS5.[/caption]\nStray's exclusive edition has a matte black sleeve, a 14.4\" x 24\" poster featuring our inquisitive hero, a \"fuzzy, pettable\" chenille patch, and six art cards.\nSomething else to keep in mind: digital copies will normally cost $30 (though there's currently a 10 percent off discount on Steam), and Stray will also be playable at no extra cost on PS4/PS5 if you're subscribed to PlayStation Plus Extra or Premium.\nI'm glad the wait isn't too long for the physical version, as that can be a frequent concern. Best case, maybe you can check out the game with PS Plus Extra to see if it's worth adding to your shelf, without needing to fully double-dip (or wait until September).\nAnnapurna Interactive and BlueTwelve Studio recently posted a \"spoiler-free introduction to Stray,\" if you're curious to see a bit more about the game and its world. This knocking-stuff-over tweet is also another biggie — I feel like it sums up the game's whole vibe.\nhttps://twitter.com/A_i/status/1546558650600148992\nThe post Stray is getting a physical edition in September appeared first on Destructoid.",

Explore the land of Hibernia, (which we know as Ireland today), lay waste to armies of Roman soldiers, and save the day for the land's oppressed people.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvLYsEpw_PQ\nAs you can see from the trailer above, The Ram of Hibernia is packed out with the franchise's trademark, fist-flying chaos. Studio Osome also promises to mix some exploration and puzzle-solving elements into the adventure, along with some magic and alchemy from Asterix & Obelix's druid pal, Getafix. The adventure will also support four-player co-op action, though this trailer only features two selectable characters, which seems a bit of a missed opportunity.\nIt has to be said that Asterix the Gaul is something of a specific franchise for a specific audience — ala Microids' other current point of interest, The Smurfs. Still, at least those faithful Asterix fans are eating well for the time being. Asterix & Obelix XXXL: The Ram from Hibernia launches this fall on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post There’s another Asterix game coming to PC and consoles this fall appeared first on Destructoid.",

But if you've had enough breathing room, today's a good day to pick up a DualSense controller or a PS5-compatible SSD with Amazon Prime Day deals.\nOn the controller front, Amazon has marked DualSense gamepads down to $59 for Prime Day, including newer variations like Cosmic Red, Galactic Purple, Nova Pink, and Starlight Blue. Or if you'd rather stick with a more \"classic\" look, the white and black controllers are also on sale — but you aren't saving quite as much, comparatively speaking. Those models usually cost $70, while the fancier DualSense colorways go for $75.\nA few months ago, I sprung for the Starlight Blue DualSense — it looks nice in person! Spending a lot of money on secondary controllers is never fun, especially when we've got longevity concerns, so I always try to wait for deals to pop up. This is as good as it gets.\n[caption id=\"attachment_334579\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1280\"] The 1TB WD_BLACK SN850 is a popular choice for PS5 owners.[/caption]\nStorage is another look-for-deals concern for PS5 owners in that there's just not enough to go around unless you upgrade. Amazon has discounts on numerous PS5-compatible M.2 SSDs for Prime Day, and one impulse-buy-worthy deal I've seen is this 1TB SSD from Nextorage for $110. Another one: the WD_Black SN850, which is $114 for 1TB.\nOf course, if you want to go big, there are 2TB SSDs for PlayStation 5 as well — but expect to pay over $200. When shopping around, don't forget the heatsink!\nI haven't made the SSD expansion jump yet, so I can't personally vouch for either of these, but I am getting dangerously close with PlayStation Plus Premium's game catalog crowding my PS5.

          "description": "\"Patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter\" - say no more\nA new Fallout New Vegas mod is in town, and it's going to be tough to see this one dethroned anytime soon.\nSpotted by Twitter user eternalfloette, the mod (found here, and created by Testudini, off of a suggestion by Fallout Mods Redditor Coffeechipmunk) is appropriately titled \"wishes come true - nuclear winter,\" and the goal is very simple: to nuke NPCs that wish for a nuclear winter. You know how most open-world games have that one line of repeated dialogue? I'm not even going to say the Skyrim one. But for New Vegas, it's:\n\"Patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter.\"\n\nI can just hear it in my head! NCR soldiers have uttered this phrase countless times in my playthroughs, and now you can do something about it. The mod \"immediately targets the NPC with a nuclear strike,\" and amazingly enough, it triggers both via dialogue initiated by the player or the NPC. Testudini makes it clear that the mod is compatible with pretty much anything that doesn't modify that particular line of dialogue, so it's super easy to install and try out.\nAs if I needed an excuse to go back to Fallout New Vegas, one of the most fun modern open-world games in the past few decades.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2DImcAPcdE\nThe post This insane Fallout New Vegas mod instantly nukes NPCs wishing for a nuclear winter appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Pop a flip, land a headshot\nRollerdrome is set to drop into the rink soon. Today, Roll7 and Private Division showed off the level design of this new blend of skating and shooting.\nInitially revealed during Sony's State of Play in June, Rollerdrome is a retro-futuristic game that mixes combat arenas and shooting with roller skates and sick tricks. As the player drops into arenas with both guns and skates on-hand, they'll need to navigate around and take out enemies in increasingly creative ways.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9QK8_mxwRs\nIn the video, Roll7's studio creative director John Ribbins and Rollerdrome senior 3D level designer Jacob Mills discuss how this is a bit of a departure. Roll7 is known for its OlliOlli games, including this year's excellent OlliOlli World.\nThose games are linear. They involve moving down a track, hitting tricks along the way. But Rollerdrome is a bit different.\nCombat arenas in Rollerdrome are open and free to pick apart at the player's discretion. So the team had to create a bit of flow to the arenas, teaching ideas along the way. They bring up evolving objectives, like going from eliminating an enemy to eliminating one while wallriding, as a way to do this.\nXtreme combat\nIt's a sick concept, and one I'm excited to see from Roll7. OlliOlli World seemed like the team really hitting a new stride with its skateboarding, but Rollerdrome is the team moving into both a 3D space and adding some combat too.\nThe visual throwback game will also get a special introductory price. On Steam and for PlayStation Plus members, Rollerdrome will have a price offer of $19.79. Then, after the offer's over, the game will bump up to $29.99 on Steam and the PlayStation Store. Rollerdrome will also be included in the PlayStation Plus Premium game trials at launch.\nRollerdrome rolls out for PC, PlayStation 4, and Ps5 on August 16.\nThe post Rollerdrome dev video takes a look at its retro-futuristic combat skateparks appeared first on Destructoid.",

Please use in the place of 5 to 35 ℃ . Also, if the intake and exhaust ports are blocked, the temperature of the main unit may rise. Make the air around the intake and exhaust ports better. If the temperature of the main unit becomes too high, it may sleep automatically to protect the main unit.\nWhen playing in TV mode, install the Nintendo Switch Dock in a location that does not retain heat. If there is foreign matter or dust on the air intake / exhaust port of the main unit, remove it with a vacuum cleaner. For your safety, do not disassemble the main unit.\"\n\nIt's mostly common sense type stuff folks! A full follow-up Q&A section for Switch overheating can be found here, and remember that Nintendo just opened up a Switch repair subscription service for Japan. The aforementioned Q&A section has images that showcase both the air intake and exhaust ports on the Switch, Switch Lite, and OLED models.\n[gallery link=\"file\" ids=\"334486,334487,334488\"]\nThe post Nintendo warns people about Switch overheating this summer appeared first on Destructoid.",

It is suspected that the developer/publisher behind brands such as Tekken, Elden Ring, Dragon Ball FighterZ, and Soulcalibur has had data pertaining to its future releases, DLC, and reveals leaked online in the wake of the attack. The news was reported by malware source code monitors vx-underground.\nWhile some of the aforementioned information has surfaced online this morning, the full extent of the data obtained by the hacking group is unknown, and could contain the personal details of company employees, as well as source code for the company's current and upcoming releases, and potentially data pertaining to the users of Bandai Namco games. As for supposed leaked games, don't believe everything you see floating around.\nThis attack is the latest in a series of massive data thefts that, in recent years, have previously ransacked the digital vaults of various big-name video game companies such as Capcom, EA, and, perhaps most famously, CD Projekt RED, the latter of which lead to the release of the entire source code of smash hit Cyberpunk 2077.\nBandai Namco is yet to offer an official statement on the ransomware attack.\nThe post Bandai Namco data leaked following alleged ransomware attack appeared first on Destructoid.",

All prior content will be intact (including the two secret characters), as well as four difficulty levels, and two-player local co-op. Black Isle also confirms that the game is Steam Deck verified.\nAs always, re-releasing old content, especially classics that were out of print and faded into the rarer/pricier used game circuits, is great. Dark Alliance II has historically been one of the more sought-after PS2/Xbox games of that generation; though prices have gone down to more reasonable levels after the re-release was in the mix.\nBut while both Dark Alliance games have their charms, the real crown jewel would be the two Champions of Norrath titles. That subseries improves upon the hack-and-slash foundation with a ton of depth and polish — not to mention that they actually have offline and online four-player co-op out of the box.\nFour-player play was fairly revolutionary at the time in terms of console dungeon crawlers, and given the huge focus on online play and isolation, it still kinda is! My wife and I have randomly been popping Champions of Norrath into our PS2 for nearly two decades, and bringing that series to modern platforms would be a way easier means of doing that!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UM95ngzoqrU\nThe post Baldur’s Gate: Dark Alliance II is coming to modern platforms soon, I hope Champions of Norrath is next appeared first on Destructoid.",

In a statement printed by IGN, the publisher announced that players who own Liberation on Steam will still be able to access, re-download, and/or play the Assassin's Creed III spin-off once it is removed from the Steam service in September.\n\"As stated in our support article, only DLCs and online features will be affected by the upcoming decommissioning,\" said Ubisoft in the statement. \"Current owners of those games will still be able to access, play or redownload them. Our teams are working with our partners to update this information across all storefronts and are also assessing all available options for players who will be impacted when these games’ online services are decommissioned on September 1st, 2022.\"\n\"It has always been our intention to do everything in our power to allow those legacy titles to remain available in the best possible conditions for players, and this is what we are working towards.\"\nDespite referencing the support article, it's worth noting that this new statement offers a little more clarity when compared to the company's previous response, which seemed to suggest that the removal of player access to decommissioned titles was merely an unfortunate inevitability. It seems that this new statement, however, puts some modicum of control back into the hands of paying customers — rather than simply pulling paid products from their hands.\nAs of September 1, Assassin's Creed Liberation will no longer be featured on the Steam platform.

It's a four-player game that's set to release \"this summer,\" and will feature a core focus of racing through obstacle courses.\nSince it's all the info we have at the moment, here's the full rundown of Kirby's Dream Buffet from Nintendo:\n\"Roll through a smorgasbord of food-themed stages in 4 rounds of 4-player fun as Kirby…who seems rounder than usual? Race through delicious obstacle courses to collect strawberries as Kirby grows. Then, turn the tides in the final round—a fruity fight atop a floating platform. Roll through delicious, food-themed obstacle courses in 4-player matches Collect strawberries to grow bigger and prepare for the final battle.

Sold separately.\"\nYou can find the Kirby's Dream Buffet listing here. That makes two Kirby games this year! Typically the fluff ball manages to knock out a ton of spinoffs these days, so this isn't as big of a surprise, but it's a welcome one regardless.

          "description": "PlayStation classic set for comeback?\nPopular import outlet Play-Asia has updated its store with a listing for what appears to be a PS4 and Nintendo Switch port of classic PlayStation RPG SaGa Frontier 2. The site claims that the '90s sequel will launch on the aforementioned platforms on August 25 of this year.\n\"SaGa Frontier 2 introduces a complete renovation of the RPG genre,\" reads the blurb on the store listing. \"Traditional computer polygonal fixtures are replaced with lush, hand-drawn watercolor graphics supported by an awe-inspiring musical score. Blending both freedom and linearity, this title utilizes the Multi-Scenario System giving players unparalleled freedom in choosing which scenario they want to play while other scenarios crisscross with one another.\"\nOriginally released in 1999, Square Enix's SaGa Frontier 2 retained the original game's taste for medieval warfare with an Anglo-Saxon aesthetic. The sequel featured a player-chosen dual storyline, with the fates of two young men eventually crossing paths to form a wider narrative arc. Sporting Square Enix's typical penchant for lavish visuals, dramatic storytelling, and evocative music, SaGa Frontier 2 was well received by players and critics alike.\nSquare Enix is yet to officially announce a remaster, remake, or even a mere re-release for SaGa Frontier 2, and as such the Play-Asia listing should be taken with a pinch of salt for now. Obviously, the original SaGa Frontier was remastered for the same platforms just last year, so the sequel following suit is almost a given at this point.\nWe will be sure to give you a heads-up if any confirmation is forthcoming.\nPlay-Asia lists SaGa Frontier 2 for PS4, Switch [Gematsu]\nThe post SaGa Frontier 2 for PS4 and Switch pops up on Japanese retail site appeared first on Destructoid.",

That said, the London-based modder does have a shop with lots of neat modified handhelds.\n\n\"The retro gaming community keeps me buzzing and I can’t thank them enough for pushing tech and design to new and exciting levels,\" Obirux said on their website.\nWhether it's a slow or fast gaming news day, projects like this give me life.\n[Via The Verge, Gizmodo]\nThe post This GBA-style Game Boy sure is sleek appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Neon Nitrous\nDuring the recent Nacon Connect live stream, the publisher offered up another slick cinematic trailer for its upcoming racer Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown. But while the dramatic preview offered up some stylish visuals and dramatic pontificating, it failed to showcase any gameplay for the title, which is currently scheduled to launch on PC and next-gen platforms in 2023.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2RxYui-Jhc\nDeveloped by veteran studio KT Racing, Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown certainly sounds like an incredibly meaty undertaking, with a host of highly realistic licensed vehicles burning rubber through what has been touted as a meticulous \"1:1\" recreation of the entirety of Hong Kong Island. An emphasis on customization will allow players to not only fine-tune their cars' appearances to perfection but also customize the appearance of the driver themselves — a feature that takes center stage in the new Solar Crown trailer.\nFirst announced in the summer of 2020, Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown was originally expected to hit the streets this September, but became one of a litany of cross-gen releases pushed back to 2023. It was also confirmed that the PS4 and Xbox One editions of the title had been canceled. Now over two years into its development, with a release scheduled for sometime in the coming 18 months, fans are becoming a tad antsy at the persistent rolling out of cinematic trailers, and are starting to wonder when they will finally get to see the ambitious-sounding racer in action.\nTest Drive Unlimited Solar Crown is in development for PS5, PC, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown gets new trailer, but gameplay still eludes appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "During last September's Nintendo Direct, Bayonetta's reemergence shocked fans, with the titular witch dodging, transforming, and shooting her way through huge monstrosities. We knew that the action romp would come exclusively to Switch this year, but today Nintendo announced an October 28 release date with an appropriately over-the-top trailer. You can watch the footage here.\nPlatinum Games' enemy and hero designs for the franchise remain stunning. Bayonetta sports butterfly wings and tentacled horns in some action sequences, while enemies take the form of armored animals – homunculi, artificial bioweapons. You'll fire canons from a moving train in a ravaged cityscape, ride grotesque crabs up skyscrapers, and even play as the new katana-wielding witch-in-training, Viola. And let's not forget that you can summon an all-powerful kaiju too. It's all wild and nonsensical as you'd expect but in the best possible way. \n\nBayonetta 3 ups the ante on Switch this October 28. A Trinity Masquerade Edition of the game will also be available, boasting a 200-page art book. More details for the special version of the game will be revealed later.",

While that heat cap is pretty impressive, we'd recommend not testing it. \nBy way of Nintendo Life, Eurogamer referenced Nintendo Japan's Customer Service Twitter account, which advised Switch owners to avoid staggeringly high temperatures and keep the intake and exhaust ports unblocked.  The good news is that if the console gets too hot, it’ll automatically sleep.

However, while the game features many tenants of the open-world genre, Sonic Team is adamant about calling Frontiers an \"open-zone\" game instead. While on the surface that sounds like little more than a marketing ploy, after chatting with the developers, it makes more sense as you dig deeper into its meaning.\nComing off 2017's Sonic Forces, a game that didn't fare well with critics or fans, the development team wanted to shake things up. Forces received criticism for its generic 3D level design, unfulfilling story, short length, and poor 2D gameplay compared to the then-newly released Sonic Mania. According to Sonic Frontiers director Morio Kishimoto (who a…",

According to information coming from Japan, Takahashi was found floating in shallow waters on the coast of Nago City on the Island of Okinawa by the country’s Coast Guard yesterday, July 6. He was wearing snorkeling gear when found by the Coast Guard. Both the Coast Guard and local police are investigating his death. \nTakahashi’s manga career began in 1982, but it didn’t truly take off until the release of Yu-Gi-Oh! in 1996. In between his start and Yu-Gi-Oh!, though, Takahashi published titles like Fighting Hawk and Tennenshoku Danji Buray, according to Kotaku. After Yu-Gi-Oh! hit shelves in 1996, the series only continued to grow in popularity, spawning a real-life card game in 1999 (that’s still extremely popular today) as well as multiple anime series. Today, the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise spans not just manga, card games, and anime, but video games as well, like this year’s Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel. \n[Source: NHK via IGN]\nThe staff at Game Informer extends their condolences to Takahashi’s family.",

Here’s what the official site has to say on the matter: \nThe Matrix Awakens was first announced and made available on the same night during the 2021 Game Awards. The Unreal Engine 5-powered demonstration from Epic Games stars Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss, who introduces the impressive graphics engine and how close to real-life its visuals can look. Awakens includes an on-rails car shootout throughout a city that often looks like it was ripped from the silver screen despite being rendered on the spot. The demo then lets you roam the massive pre-populated city and change things like time of day or traffic congestion to flex what UE5 is capable of. It’s a terrific showcase for the future of games, so if you haven’t given it a download yet, you’ll want to check it out before the delisting on Saturday.\nYou can watch us tour The Matrix Awakens in this episode of New Gameplay Today.",

That’s because the studio is launching Gwent: Rogue Mage, a new single-player roguelike deckbuilder, tomorrow. \nAnnounced by IGN, Gwent: Rogue Mage launches tomorrow, July 7, on PC, iOS, and Android. IGN reports that this game is what Project Golden Nekker, which the team revealed earlier this year, has turned into, and CD Projekt Red is marketing it as a single-player expansion to Gwent: The Witcher Card Game. However, you won’t need to own that because Rogue Mage is standalone. You can purchase the standalone version for $9.99 or the premium edition, which includes in-game skins and cosmetics, and card packs for the multiplayer portion of Gwent, for $19.99. \n“Rogue Mage came out of us noticing that years after The Witcher 3’s release, there are a significant number of players who want a more PvE experience from Gwent,” game director Vladimir Tortsov told IGN. “While Gwent multiplayer is a fantastic game for those who are looking for a great PvP multiplayer experience, we perfectly understand that many Witcher players loved the original mini-game of Gwent for totally different reasons. With Rogue Mage, we aim to give this audience a reason to play modern-day Gwent in the format they prefer.” \nIGN has an exclusive preview of Gwent: Rogue Mage after going hands-on with it ahead of tomorrow’s release, and if you’re looking for even more details about it, including what this single-player deckbuilder roguelike’s gameplay is like, be sure to check it out. \n[Source: IGN]\nAre you excited to check out Gwent: Rogue Mage?

That's because, alongside that cinematic \"Father and Son\" trailer, the studio has released a new unboxing video for the game's Collector's and Jötnar editions. \nAs you might expect, both editions of Ragnarok look fantastic. It doesn't hurt that both come in a fancy Knowledge Keeper's Shrine box that features beautiful artwork and plenty of fun goodies inside. Check them both out for yourself in the trailer below: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, you can't go wrong with either edition.

The new trailer released today is short and sweet but still packs a godly punch. Clocking in at just 30 seconds, we see Kratos and Atreus fending off some standard mob enemies before coming face to face with a gigantic black wolf. \nCheck out the cinematic \"Father and Son\" trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nFans of Norse mythology might recognize this beast as Fenrir, the son of Loki. Fenrir plays a significant part in the Norse story of Ragnarok, but we won't spoil that here. Plus, Ragnarok's take on Fenrir could be completely different anyway. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don't have to wait long because God of War: Ragnarok hits PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on November 9, 2022.",

          "description": "Nearly 30 years after its initial release, Live a Live is finally coming west. This 1994 Super Famicom RPG is from creator Takashi Tokita, one of the key developers behind Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy IV. While it would be fascinating to play through Tokita's original vision of Live a Live, we're getting an enhanced remake using the same HD-2D graphical style from the Octopath Traveler games.\nI recently spent roughly five hours in this ambitiously designed title, and can confidently say I enjoyed almost every second of its unique approach to storytelling and how it's brought to life through beautiful retro visuals. Square Enix is releasing Live a Live on Switch on July 22. Here are a handful reasons why you should put it on your radar:\nSeven Distinct Stories\nA Fun Assortment of Characters\nAdult Language and Humor?\nExcellent Writing\nCombat Has Depth...But Will We See It Enough?\n\n\nIt's Beautiful\nThe 2D-HD look is every bit as stunning as it is in Octopath Traveler. The backdrops in each story are a feast for the eyes. The sprite characters don't offer much animation but do move appropriately to convey an emotion or to highlight a dramatic sequence. The visuals scream of the 16-bit age, but also have modern touches everywhere, like realistic lighting of saloon doors swinging when the stranger strolls in to grab a drink.",

Announced by Ubisoft today, this show kicks off at 11 a.m. PT and will hopefully provide a substantial look at the open-world multiplayer ship battles and progress made since the delay. Skull and Bones showed promise when it was first announced during an E3 press conference in 2017. Slated to release in the following year, it was indefinitely delayed, even thought to be canceled given the lack of updates from Ubisoft. With fresh wind behind its sails, we will now see what it looks like on current-gen platforms. Come Thursday, you can view the Ubisoft Forward livestream right here.\nUbisoft also revealed a second livestream slated to air on September 10. We don't know what games are in this presentation, but Ubisoft's blog says it will be for multiple projects. Here's hoping Star Wars, Avatar, Assassin's Creed, and Splinter Cell are mentioned in some capacity, if not outright shown.\nUntil then, are you excited for Skull & Bones?

A $399 collector's edition is on the way and comes with a 27.6-inch Crypto figurine, an Arkvoodle statue, a CD of the orchestral score, and an artbook.\nThe remake of the original Destroy All Humans felt a bit dated. In our review, Joe Juba said \"The brightest moments are when the action gives way to pure chaos. I watched electricity arc between humans, made brains pop out of heads, and turned a secret base into smoldering ruins with my spaceship’s death ray. But like a person floating above the ground in the glow of an abducto beam, those moments aren’t connected to anything substantial; they just make some noise and get flung aside.\" The remake of the sequel modernizes more of the content. Let's hope that helps Crypto find new life again. I'd love to see an entirely new adventure with this foul-mouthed alien leading the charge.\nPurchase",

The surprise, however, comes from the studio’s approach to narrative.

It wanted to tell a story that hadn’t been told.\nAdmittedly, where Starward landed was a story told before – almost 60 years ago, in the novel The Invincible, written by Stanisław Lem.

          "description": "Starting a cult isn’t easy work, but somebody’s got to do it in Massive Monster’s Cult of the Lamb, which hits consoles and PC next month. Fortunately, the team behind the devilishly cute game has released a new trailer with tips and tricks to start, and maintain, the best cult.\nThe first step is simple: grow your flock. All you need to do is fight through hordes of demon monsters to save innocent woodland creatures that will make for perfect initiates. Of course, you rename each addition and select other facets of their new life to dictate what kind of cult member (and worker) they’ll be for you.\nCheck it out in action: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, growing your flock is just the first step. You also need to satisfy the faithful. To do this, you must tend to your congregation by leading and feeding them and ultimately keeping them happy. You can give them gifts, invite them to feasts, and much more. The final step is to cleanse the non-believers, naturally. \nUnhappy cult members might lose faith in you, but this is fixable. You can opt to re-educate them in the ways of your cult, which will hopefully stop them from persuading other members to rise against you, or, if you just can’t see a solution, you can always sacrifice them to the gods. \nAnd there you have it – you’re ready to start a cult. For more, watch Game Informer’s exclusive Cult of the Lamb New Gameplay Today, which features never-before-seen gameplay, and then watch this new gameplay trailer that recently debuted during Summer Game Fest, which is where we learned Cult of the Lamb will come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on Aug. 11. \nAre you excited for Cult of the Lamb?

That means the console looks like a big, cracked slab of dwarven-crafted uru that still channels electricity and may or may not be liftable depending on if you’re worthy. It's hard to tell if that handle is real or simply edited into the photo for full effect, but you should probably assume the worst (best?) when considering making space for this thing. \nThe contest begins today and concludes on July 21.

The idea of getting a demo this year is certainly enticing too, as Sea of Stars has looked phenomenal every time it’s made an appearance. \nThe game was first revealed in 2020 after a successful Kickstarter campaign and evokes JRPGs like Chrono Trigger, Illusion of Gaia, and Breath of Fire. It even features music contributions by Chrono Trigger composer Yasunori Mitsuda. Despite being a role-playing title, it serves as a prequel to 2018’s The Messenger, a Ninja Gaiden-inspired action game that was well-recieved (here’s our review). Sea of Stars centers on two heroes who wield the power of the moon and the sun to battle an evil alchemist. You can watch the original reveal trailer below.",
