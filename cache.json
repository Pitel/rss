          "description": "The wait is over.\nThe PS1 played host to a staggering number of memorable and influential RPGs, one of which was Konami’s Suikoden. After that strong debut came a handful of sequels that eventually puttered out during the sixth generation of consoles, and Konami has virtually abandoned the series since. Not ones to be stifled, some key members of the Suikoden crew eventually left Konami and founded a new team called Rabbit & Bear, which started a successful crowdfunding campaign for this spiritual successor called Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes. After a four-year development cycle, Eiyuden Chronicle is finally in our hands and while it has its share of issues, this is overall a deeply enjoyable and nostalgic JRPG that we’re sure is going to get a lot of love.\nThe story is set in the fictional land of Allraan and begins by focusing on the rising tensions between the powerful imperial country of Galdea and a neighboring province called the League of Nations. Though there are technically three protagonists to this narrative, your main character to begin with is Nowa, a chipper young man from a quiet border village who joins a small peacekeeping military unit for the League of Nations. Nowa and his band go about their business quelling bandit raids and helping people to the best of their ability, but soon find themselves caught in the middle of much larger political tension that eventually gives way to war between the Empire and the League. To reclaim his homeland and avenge his losses, Nowa thus sets out to build a resistance and defeat the Galdeans.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

And there was Kudzu and its unsubtle similarity to all-time classic Zelda: Link’s Awakening in its 1993 original Game Boy iteration. It’s crazy to think that we played Link's Awakening to death now 30 years ago.\nTime flies fast like an arrow from Link’s bow indeed.

This, I believe, should be enough to tempt you into dunking it enthusiastically into your next break coffee, but if you need more convincing, let’s do it.\nCreated by E.H Jørgensen, whose credits include Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak, Rising Up is a relatively simple 3 button side scroller that has you make your way up an office building, destroying everything in your path. First, irate co-workers wield swivel chairs. Then, security join the fray. Then some sort of G-men get involved. You can punch, block, jump, and air-kick.

This is not much fun, though it's a great opportunity to meet and bond with other would-be tenants over a shared, grinding resentment of landlords who will literally stuff a bed in a toilet and call it a \"studio apartment\". It's also left me powerfully invested in the premise of Blue Prince, a first-person puzzler which looks like a graphic novel and starts with your character inheriting a huge, weird, isolated mansion, Mt. Holly, from an eccentric great-uncle. \r\n\n\r\nLucky you! There's a catch, though: according to your great-uncle's will, you only get to keep the place if you can find its 46th room. The catch hanging off that catch is that going by its flatplan, the mansion only has 45 rooms. And the catch hanging off that catch is that the mansion changes shape between visits. Every time you open one of its many doors, you must choose from three cards to decide which room is on the other side. To find the elusive 46th room, you must \"draft\" rooms in certain combinations to unfold the mystery of the place and wiggle your way to its heart.\r\n \nRead more",

Mostly, though, I think it’s because of my brain doing the thing where, say, you notice a yellow car on a walk and then see dozens of them. I was going to write a car make there but I don’t know any.

Following on from the mega update of 1.6 a month ago, and 1.6.3 soon after that, the hardy perennial farming game has a new 1.6.4 mini update. The key addition this time is more new layouts that will appear after you reach the bottom of the mines, and more layouts for the volcano mines too. If you've not played Stardew Valley you might wonder why there are deep mines and volcanos, and to you I say \"Pah! You should play Stardew Valley.\"\n1.6.4 also has a lot of bug fixes (including fixing disappearing pets, new pets being a key feature of 1.6) and some balance changes, as well as a host of fixes for modders and modded players. ConcernedApe said early on that 1.6 would be an update for modders, so it's nice to see that being supported. You can read the full patch notes here.\nRead more",

It's the work of 250 people, with Jan Valta returning as composer. According to Vávra, \"what we are making now is what it was supposed to be in the beginning, but we were not able to do it because we didn't have enough resources and experience.\"\r\n\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Friends, I have officially discovered another game I can play with my life partner, who regards most games with enormous suspicion and fatigue. That game is Morels: The Hunt 2, released this week, and as you might guess, it is about finding and identifying various species of mushroom in lush, photorealistic wilderness locations. There are also unicorns, crystal skulls and robot parts. Slightly confused by the unicorns, crystal skulls and robot parts, if I'm honest. It feels a bit like developers Abrams Studios are unconvinced as to the popular appeal of mushroom hunting, and have garlanded the concept with random mythology so as to widen the Venn diagram overlap between \"fungi fans\" and \"people who want to live in cyberpunk Narnia\". \nRead more",

          "description": "The surreal pop synth of Sayonara Wild Hearts may have been the game that put Swedish developer Simogo on the map for PC players, but for me their earlier iOS puzzler Device 6 stands in my memory as being one of the most distinctive video games I've played. An interactive mystery novel at its heart, Device 6 took full advantage of its mobile-based hardware, asking players to turn and rotate their device to read certain lines of text, and scroll through its chapters searching for audio visual clues to solve its puzzles. I've often lamented that it never made its way to other platforms, even though part of its magic is inherently tied to physicality of its tactile origins.\nHappily, after playing a few hours of Simogo's latest game, Lorelei And The Laser Eyes it's clear this equally classy detective story shares much of the same DNA as Device 6. It has the same love of riddles and mysterious, cryptic puzzles, only now they're writ large in a fully explorable 3D setting - a monochrome and maze-like hotel belonging to a reclusive artist. But Simogo's love of text hasn't been diminished in the process. Early on you find an instruction manual for Lorelei And The Laser Eyes within the game itself, which straight away tells you to have a pen and paper nearby to help solve its numerous conundrums. Heck, publishers Annapurna Interactive even sent me a full-blown notebook in the post just to hammer it home. They're not kidding, either. Even the opening section of the game had me scribbling down names, sums and symbols, much like Tunic, Return Of The Obra Dinn and Outer Wilds did before it. Which is just as well, really, as I'll definitely be needing some reminders when I come to play the full version on May 16th.\nRead more",

          "description": "Years before she worked on top-drawer point-and-clickers Return To Monkey Island and Thimbleweed Park, Australian game developer Jenn Sandercock was a junior designer on Team Bondi's historical open world game L.A. Noire. Eventually published by Grand Theft Auto developers Rockstar in 2011, L.A. Noire took seven years to make and is an especially notorious example of crunch culture and mismanagement. Sandercock joined in the middle of one such crunch period, and wanted to make life a little easier for her exhausted colleagues. \"Everyone looked so miserable after literally years of hard work & crunch,\" she wrote on Twitter in 2018. \"So late one night after work I baked 2 cakes for the office. I sent out a mass email & we all took 30 minutes to eat cake and talk.\" Sandercock began hosting weekly \"Cake Days\", baking a fresh batch in her own time to share around the office.\r\n\n\r\nRockstar were unimpressed, however. They thought Cake Day was evidence of poor productivity and, according to Sandercock, badgered Team Bondi leadership into forcing her to only share cake during official lunch hours. \"Apparently the higher ups thought our entire office slacked off ALL the time because we had cake once a week,\" Sandercock wrote. She herself was told \"that I was jeopardising my career\". Sandercock hasn't let the demise of Cake Day cramp her creative interest in food, however. In fact, she's found a way to combine baking with game design. Sandercock is now the author of Edible Games, a book of recipes and instructions for concocting games out of food, and food out of games.\r\n \nRead more",

However. Eagle-eyed viewers of the Fallout show noted that episode 6 gives you a number for Valt-Tec that you can actually get in touch with - 213-25-VAULT (or, 213-258-2858). Charges apply, as well as international codes if you're outside the US, which makes it 001-213-258-2858. \nIf you text the number you get a reply from Vault-Tec saying \"The next available appointment is 33 weeks from now, please stand by!\" (handily captured by X user FanaticalGuy cos my response hasn't come through yet). And then the significantly less immersive \"Reply Y to get recurring marketing and other texts from FallOut\", which is quite funny. There is speculation that this is just a reference to Vault 33, the vault where main character Lucy was born and raised. On the other hand, 33 weeks from now is November, the month when both Fallout 4 and Fallout 76 came out.\nRead more",

That’ll mean a tasty increase to production efficiency, so I’m not complaining - but the Technocrats will, so the vote won’t pass unless I can persuade the Machinists, their less extreme cousins, to support the bill. Not to worry: I promise the Machinists they can choose the next law we vote on, and watch a chunk of undecided voters shift towards implied eugenics.\nThe Frostpunk 2 beta has rammed home how different my role is to Frostpunk 1’s dictator.

Alas, it did not sell well. Boss Key closed less than a year after launch, and the game soon followed. But after years of work, a group of fans this weekend successfully ran the first public test for a workaround to play the game again.

          "description": "Poslední měsíc byl plný zajímavých akcí, o kterých Vám bastlíři z projektu MacGyver mohou povědět, protože se na ně sami vydali. Kde všude byli, ptáte se? Objevili se na Installfestu, Arduino Day, Hackaday Europe a tajném srazu bastlířů z Twitteru. A z každé akce pro vás mají zajímavé poznatky.\r\n\r\nKromě reportáží a zážitků mají samozřejmě i jiné novinky - Průša pracuje na skříni pro XL, která bude mít i měření teploty, řízený odtah a filtry. Na trhu se objevil zajímavý osciloskop, který obsahuje i zdroj, multimetr, generátor, spektrální analyzátor a uvnitř zabudovaný interpreter MicroPythonu. A ST zavádí nové technologie u svých procesorů.\r\n\r\nZe světa hardwaru můžou zmínit nové výkonné desky s podporou pro Arduino včetně PLC od Finderu. Také se objevila spousta zajímavé literatury pro milovníky precizní techniky. Poreferovat se dá i o věcech, co nově vyzkoušeli - kupříkladu levnou (ale přesto funkční a pohodlnou) pájecí pinzetu, jak se dělají teardrops v KiCADu 8 nebo jak na IBIS modely zdarma.\r\n\r\nPokud jde o software či jeho kombinaci s hardwarem, třeba dojde řeč na zranitelnost zámků Saflok, backdoor v XZ utils, dokumentační nástroj pro kabeláž nebo ST-Link s integrovaným power profilerem.\r\n\r\nSamozřejmě svoje místo budou mít i bizarní témata, třeba jak změna časového pásma způsobí, že eDoklady budou tvrdit, že jste se narodili v jiný den. Kanada se snaží bojovat s větrnými mlýny zákazem Flipper Zero, IRC klient přímo v UEFI, jak umístit video do QR kódu nebo proč vznikla panika z UV světla vycházejícího z RGB LED.\r\n\r\nPříští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v pondělí 22. dubna od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

          "description": "Not too long ago, I jokingly predicted it would only be a matter of time until a sick Elden Ring fan beat the game using something silly like a deadly venom-filled jellyfish as a controller. I couldn't have been more wrong. Players are seemingly getting serious and building the weapons they see in the game and turning them into the controllers they'll use to take over the Lands Between.\n\n\nThat's the story of Louis 64, a YouTuber and likely contender to the title of IRL Elden Lord, who's just shown his greatsword-shaped controller. If you look at the video below, you'll notice that he's not talking about a greatsword with some buttons on it, like that legendary Resident Evil 4 chainsaw controller from 20 years ago, but rather about a motion controller than Louis swings in real life to get his character to replicate his moves in the game. \n\n\n\n\nThat's damn heavy, absolutely wild, and possibly even dangerous — at least for all of the stuff Louis has on his walls, as one commenter on Twitter states. Still, I wouldn't worry too much, as it's far from Louis' first adventure in swordsmithing. He'd recently made a buster sword that he used to bust Final Fantasy Remake with.\n\n\n\n\nAnd he's also the mind behind the absolutely bonkers idea of beating Elden Ring with a literally absolutely bananas controller:\n\n\n\n\nI'm sure Miyazaki would be extremely proud.\n\n\nYou can now play Elden Ring on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The highly anticipated Shadow Of The Erdtree will come out on June 21.\n\nThe post Elden Ring fan uses actual greatsword as a controller appeared first on Destructoid.",

If the Quincies from the Thousand Year Blood War have caught your eye and you’ve chosen to side with them, then the first ability you’ll be looking to unlock is Schrift. \n\n\nHow to get Schrift in Type Soul\n\n\n\nMust be a part of the Quincy faction\n\n\nReach Grade 2 Quincy, which can be done by completing a few missions \n\n\n\nAfter reaching Grade 2 as a Quincy, find Balance at the top of Wandenreich Castle and speak with him. You will then need to go down to the Worshipper Statue near where players first become Quincies. After interacting with it, three different texts will appear on your screen, which mentions three different enemy types.\n\n\nNow comes the challenging part of the questline: To obtain a Schrift, you must defeat the three enemy types assigned to you without dying. Since dying will reset all quest progress, keeping a checklist of the enemies you’ve killed will be helpful since there isn’t a quest tracker in Type Soul to let you know when you’ve completed the hunt. \n\n\nEnemies to defeat\n\n\nThe possible required enemies to defeat are:\n\n\n\n5 Arrancars\n\n\n5 Shinigamis\n\n\n2 Adjuchas\n\n\n5 Menoses\n\n\n15 Fishbones\n\n\n\nAfter fulfilling the above requirements, return to the Worshipper Statue and interact with it. You will respawn back in Wandenreich City and be designated a random Schrift from the following types:\n\n\n\nHeat (Common)\n\n\nWind (Common)\n\n\nThunderbolt (Rare)\n\n\nFear (Legendary)\n\n\nMiracle (Legendary)\n\n\n\nWith the Quincies’ primary combat ability in hand, you can continue your journey through Type Soul and work on acquiring the best Quincy weapons. \n\nThe post How to unlock Schrift in Type Soul appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's also working hard on Street Fighter statues, including an upcoming Cammy statue, which the studio revealed a first look at on Twitter. \n\n\n\n\nCammy is the latest in a line that already includes Ryu, Akuma, and Chun-Li. The statue, which depicts Cammy in her modern Street Fighter 6 costume, is crazy gorgeous, though. \n\n\nFor the statue, Cammy is in her traditional victory pose, with her back turned and giving the viewer a steely gaze. The photos show off an incredible level of detail, from the texture of the jacket to the incredible face sculpt. The statue also gets a cameo from Cammy's cat, which makes perfect sense to anyone who knows just how much she loves her feline friends. \n\n\nThe Prime 1 Studios Cammy 1/4 scale statue doesn't yet have a price point or release date, or details on included accessories, though details should be announced soon. Looking at the other releases in the line, fans can likely expect multiple head portraits to be included--as well as a price upwards of $1,000. \n\n\nFor fans looking for more, rest assured, Cammy is not the end of the line.

This means that you’ll be fishing from the beach on the mainland, or Ginger Island’s Pirate Cove, or South, Southeast, and Western shores.\n\n\nIf you’re in need of a Pufferfish and it isn’t Summer, you can also use Magic Bait which let’s you catch any fish regardless of the season.\n\n\nThe Pufferfish can be a bit tricky to catch as they tend to move up and down quickly as if they’re bouncing in the water. You might want to use a Trap Bobber for Pufferfish to make it less likely that they’ll escape while you’re trying to reel them in.\n\n\nYou can also sometimes find them in garbage cans during the Summer, for some reason. And, like many things, it is sometimes for sale at the Traveling Cart for 600 to 1000 G.\n\n\nOnce you have a Pufferfish, you can turn it into sashimi.

Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, and Hades were all excellent in their own ways. But going into Hades 2, I was curious just how this studio would tackle a sequel, a first for the team.\n\n\nTurns out, I didn't really need to worry. I've hit the \"end screen\" of the Hades 2 Technical Test, and all I want to do is play more Hades 2.\n\n\n\n\nDeath to Chronos\n\n\nThe slice, available as the Hades 2 Technical Test, is essentially the opening of the game.

          "description": "Stratagems are powerful tools in Helldivers 2, but you're typically limited to four per mission. But if you're fortunate, you may be able to up that count. The SEAF Artillery found on a map adds an extra Stratagem to the mix, but it works best when you choose the right payload.\n\n\nThere are multiple payload variants. The best payload options you can use for the SEAF Artillery can be based on preference, but it also depends on the difficulty and enemy type in Helldivers 2. If you're against bugs, tossing down a napalm strike to defend points is ideal. But when fighting Automatons, a calculated EMF strike is wiser. For high-level missions, you can pick smoke to cover your retreat. Both factions die to explosives, though, and those are likely the ones you want to know about the most. \n\n\nThe SE…",

One of the highlights of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was Knuckles, voiced by Idris Elba. The fish-out-of-water gags and his strict adherence to the echidna warrior code, which is in stark contrast to Sonic's fun-loving personality, made for an enjoyable dynamic within the cast of characters. Knuckles, the new six-episode streaming show on Paramount Plus, tries to carry forward that dynamic. However, thanks to low stakes, a palpable disconnect from the larger Sonic story, and too much emphasis on the human characters in the world, it falls short of the heights reached by the two theatrical films.\nWarning: While I …",

Although this technically isn’t an official announcement either, I'd say there's roughly a 99.99 percent chance that Black is involved.\nThe Minecraft movie, which has been in development in some form or another since 2014, is directed by Nacho Libre director Jared Hess. The cast includes Jason Momoa (Aquaman, Game of Thrones), Danielle Brooks (The Color Purple), Jennifer Coolidge (The White Lotus, American Pie), and Emma Myers (Wednesday). Minecraft is scheduled to hit theaters on April 4, 2025. \nJack Black is obviously no stranger to video game movies. He voiced Bowser in The Super Mario Bros. Movie and portrays Claptrap in the upcoming Borderlands.",

          "description": "With huge winter game releases behind us and huge summer announcements right around the corner, the games industry is set for a relatively quiet month or two. Luckily, Nintendo plans to briefly step in to fill that void. Today, it announced the next Indie World Showcase, a live stream event focused on the latest indie titles to come to the Switch, for tomorrow, April 17. The showcase will air at 7 AM PT/10 AM ET and last for around 20 minutes.\nNew #IndieWorld Showcase incoming! 💡\n\nTune in tomorrow, 4/17 at 7am PT for roughly 20 minutes of announcements and updates on indie games headed to #NintendoSwitch in 2024.\n\nWatch live here: https://t.co/jGiccyBhME pic.twitter.com/V31Dfuxs0N\nApril 16, 2024\nIt's in the name so it might be obvious to some, but don't expect any first-party games or hardware announcements out of this event. An Indie World Showcase is also not the same thing as a Nintendo Partner Showcase, which is just a show about third party games. This can include indie titles (the last one had a trailer for Another Crab's Treasure, for example) but also includes larger developers, like Sega or Atlus.\nIf that's confusing, you can get a sense of the games that have been showcased in this type of presentation in the past by visiting the official Indie World site. Fans will most likely be clamoring for a trailer or release date for Hollow Knight: Silksong, the sequel to the 2017 bug-themed Metroidvania. But while it's (hopefully) right around the corner, there's no specific reason to believe it will appear at this event other than the fact that it's an indie game coming to the Switch.\nWe won't know until the Indie World Showcase properly airs tomorrow. When it does, you can watch it right here.",

The outlet’s sources report that the John Wick and Matrix star is voicing Shadow the Hedgehog.\nSonic the Hedgehog 3 is set to premiere on December 20 and will pit Shadow alongside a returning Dr. Robotnik (played by Jim Carrey) against Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles. The returning cast includes Ben Schwartz, Idris Elba, James Marsden, and Colleen O'Shaughnessey. The film's first trailer premiered in front of a select audience at Cinemacon in Las Vegas last week and it provided the first real look at Shadow. Unfortunately, the trailer has yet to be publically released. \nParamount has yet to officially confirm Reeves' casting, but if this is true, he will join fellow new cast members, including Krysten Ritter, Alyla Browne, James Wolk, Sofia Pernas, Cristo Fernández, and Jorma Taccone. Shadow's debut was teased at the end of Sonic the Hedgehog 2, but his voice performer has been a tantalizing mystery since the third film was announced in August 2022. \nMeanwhile, the standalone Knuckles series premieres on Paramount Plus on April 26. You can watch the first full-length trailer for that here.\n[Source: The Hollywood Reporter]",

As such, Square Enix has released a new benchmark software to let PC players test how well their machines will handle these new bells and whistles while getting a small head start on Dawntrail.\nAvailable as a free download for Windows, the benchmark software uses playable characters and actual maps to assign a performance score to your PC. This will provide a peek at the new graphical update, which spruces up the game with enhanced textures, shadows, material qualities, and other elements. You can download the benchmark here. \nThe benchmark includes a character creator for players to craft a fresh hero ahead of Dawntrail’s launch. It also includes access to the new female Hrothgar race. Existing characters can also be imported into the benchmark, and the appearance data from these characters can be imported into the full release of Dawntrail on Windows. \nFinal Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail launches on July 2. You can learn more about the expansion here. The game currently has a crossover event with Final Fantasy XVI that runs until May 8",

          "description": "Despite currently being in the midst of a crossover event with Avatar: The Last Airbender, Fortnite is teasing an upcoming event with a returning collaborator: Star Wars. The details have yet to be disclosed, but attentive fans of the science fiction juggernaut will notice something about the start date right away. The event is set to take place on Friday, May 3. The following day, May 4th, is known to many as Star Wars Day.\nWe have a good feeling about this...Star Wars is returning to #Fortnite. pic.twitter.com/6MCkDkolNb\nApril 15, 2024\nThe most newsworthy piece of info here, however, is the fact that the teaser indicates collaborations across several of Fortnite's new modes. This includes the classic battle Royale mode, the survival/crafting Lego mode, and the rhythm Festival mode, though Rocket Racing was notably excluded. Crossovers between Fortnite and other IPs usually just include cosmetic bundles, but this seems to imply that it will provide content for three different areas of the game.\nThe current Elements event pass technically includes a Lego variant skin as well as a guitar for Festival mode, so this Star Wars event could be as simple as that, but it's not unreasonable to speculate that Star Wars is a big enough property to warrant a larger scale crossover event. That said, this is just speculation.\nPrevious Star Wars crossovers included a Darth Vader boss battle, lightsabers, blasters, and force abilities, as well as a huge roster of skins spanning the movies and shows. Most recently, Ahsoka joined the fray as a part of the Chapter 4 Season 4 battle pass. \nIf you're interested in more Star Wars video games, you're in luck – we just launched our latest cover story, which features an exclusive look at Star Wars Outlaws. We've also got a hands-on preview, a video interview with the developers, and an entire hub devoted to this month's coverage of the game.\nWhat are you hoping to see from the upcoming Fortnite x Star Wars crossover?

However, this isn’t an official revival but rather due to the work of a dedicated group of fans.\nLawBreakers was created by Boss Key Productions, a team led by Gears of War lead designer Cliff Bleszinski. Upon launching for PlayStation 4 and PC in August 2017, it garnered a generally positive critical impression (read our review here). However, it failed to find its place in the competitive multiplayer shooter market of the time, resulting in poor sales and low player engagement that eventually led to its early demise in September 2018. \nNow, a team of passionate fans has worked to bring LawBreakers back. Dubbed The RELB Project, the project has been in the works since at least 2020. Its FAQ states that “This is a project to bring back the game LawBreakers, it's done by creating 'fake' servers that the original game client uses. You can join by downloading the launcher, patching your game and playing like normal.”\nRELB’s website allows you to download the launcher. Despite this revival being an unofficial project, Cliff Bleszinki (who has been vocal about wanting to see LawBreakers come back) has given it his blessing and enthusiastically shared RELB’s Discord on Saturday. \nSomehow LawBreakers is coming back, see below!!!\nhttps://t.co/1COV57FZQ5\nApril 13, 2024\nThe RELB Project is still very much a work in progress, but the team held its first series of public playtests this past weekend. Although several modes and features from the game were disabled, these sessions appear to have been largely successful. The next playtest has not been scheduled, and the team is currently seeking more developers.\nWhat did you think of LawBreakers and are you excited to see it playable again?

          "description": "The rogue-lite and roguelike genres have been growing in popularity over the years They’re challenging games where players attempt runs with different abilities and random elements that generally force the player to restart from zero or near-zero for each attempt. They are born from the 1980 game Rogue which established many of the mechanics now considered staples of the genre.\nBut the difference between rogue-lite and -like has always been confusing, so we asked an expert from Evil Empire, the co-developer of Dead Cells, to explain it to us. Lucie Dewagnier is the game director of the upcoming The Rogue: Prince of Persia (a rogue-lite) and defines the subgenres like this.\n“Roguelike is – like the game Rogue – a game where you play, you die, you hit replay, but nothing is kept between your attempts. You will always replay the game from a blank slate. \nRogue-lite may add some things like permanent upgrades and enhancements that make your future runs – your future tries – easier and has progression systems that do not exist in roguelikes.”\nMy hope, and I presented this plan to Dewagnier, is we drop the -lite and -like suffixes from the genre name and just refer to all games as existing within the Rogue genre. Dead Cells, Hades, Undermine, Returnal, etc. are no longer variations of rogue-lites and roguelikes – they’re all Rogue games.\n“Yeah, even now there are games like Spelunky that are part of Rogulikes, but they have progression systems with new content you can get, so maybe it’s rogue-lite? Maybe it’s Roguelike? They’re Rogues.”\nTo read more about Evil Empire and Dewagnier’s next game, The Rogue: Prince of Persia (which is a rogue-lite, “With a ‘T’,” Dewagnier says), head here.",

This newest set, Temporal Forces, continues the Ancient and Future conventions introduced in Paradox Rift, giving players new strategies featuring a variety of easily playable Basic Pokémon. \nThe Pokémon Company sent along a bunch of booster packs for us to open to see what we could pull. The set is one of the smaller recent expansions, but still large by the long-established standard of Pokémon TCG. Players picking up Temporal Forces can expect to pull from a pool of more than 160 cards. In addition to the additional Ancient and Future Pokémon, Temporal Forces reintroduces Ace Spec cards, first implemented during the Black & White series of cards. Those Ace Spec cards were some of the more unique cards I pulled, but the full-art Pokémon and ex cards most wowed me; I particularly love the Arbok and Minccio full-arts I grabbed. \nCheck out my favorites I pulled from Pokémon Trading Card Game's Scarlet & Violet – Temporal Forces expansion below!\n\n Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet – Temporal Forces is available now. For more Pokémon TCG content, including galleries of past expansions, interviews, and the latest news, visit our hub by clicking the banner below.",

It includes elements from that game while featuring new stages and enemies of its own.  \nWrecking Crew ‘98 is the Japan-only sequel to the NES classic Wrecking Crew. First released in 1998 for Nintendo Power’s download service before getting its own cartridge, this marks the game’s first release in the West.\nAmazing Hebereke is a 1994 fighting game by Sunsoft that pits up to four players battling to knock each other out.

Sporting an eye-popping art direction that blends anime and graffiti art influences, this promising-looking action platformer is coming this year.\nRKGK (pronounced “Rakugaki”) unfolds in a Cap City, a futuristic metropolis caught in a vice grip by the oppressive B Corp led by the villainous Mr. Buff. The plot centers on rebellious graffiti artist Valah, who rages against this machine by using her art to bring life back to the city and inspire its citizens to stand up and rebel.\n\n\nValah gets around by using her graffiti paint to stylishly grind on rails while chaining jumps, dashes, and glides. She also has appears to have her own drone to soar across the cityscape. High-speed platforming is the name of the game, and maintaining a smooth flow state sends her into Defacer mode, transforming the world into a dreamy animated version of itself. Although the trailer doesn’t show off gameplay, it depicts Valah spraying paint to destroy B Corps’ robotic minions. You’ll also be able to create graffiti art using an array of paint and cosmetic tools. Check out the screenshots below for an in-game look at RKGK. \n\nRKGK is Wabisabi Games’ debut title and looks to follow in the graffiti-soaked dystopian future footsteps of games like Jet Set Radio and Marc Ecko’s Getting Up (remember that?).

The scuba diving exploration/restaurant simulator has also been enhanced with a few Sony-exclusive perks.\nDave the Diver is also coming to PS4, but a new trailer shows off the PS5 version's DualSense-specific features. That includes using the controller's haptic feedback to \"sense the movements of the deep sea.\" The adaptive triggers add a kick to firing Dave's speargun and a vibrating tension to the harpoon gun. Sound effects, such as phone call ringtones, are emitted through the controller speaker. \n\n\nDave the Diver stars the titular diver as he explores undersea environments to locate and capture various marine species. After fishing, players then use these ingredients to operate a growing sushi restaurant.\nAs editor-in-chief Matt Miller wrote in his 8.75 out of 10 review, \"You might question whether a sushi restaurant management sim crossed with underwater diving is your cup of tea, but that would be missing the point. Dave the Diver is a unique and memorable vacation away from expectations, and it's the very fact that you don't usually play games like this that makes it so satisfying.\"\nDave the Diver is already available on Switch and PC, and has a Godzilla-themed crossover coming in May.",

Along the way, they'll meet new friends and encounter mysterious rivals.\"\nAdventure Mode features 200 new stages set across different worlds, such as Banana Farm, Rose Garden, Floating City, Golden Temple, and Stone Valley.

          "description": "Total Eclipse, a real-time, curse-breaking, 3D adventure (with a dash of Indiana Jones flair), is ready for public testing!\nOriginally unleashed by Incentive Software Ltd. in 1988, Total Eclipse added yet another groundbreaking title to their repertoire of revolutionary games.\nStep into the shoes of a heroic archeologist on October 26, 1930, as a total solar eclipse akin to the one happening today over North America looms over Cairo. Knowing of the Ardognus prophecy, created by the powerful high priest Hahmid III, you must find and destroy the hidden shrine devoted to Ra before the eclipse occurs.\nEmbark on this exciting journey packed with a trusty gun for blasting through doors or dispatching undead mummies; a compass to guide you through a treacherous pyramid; a wristwatch to track the precious time left; and a water bottle to fight dehydration (you’re only human after all). \nCan you solve this ancient mystery within 120 minutes and avert catastrophe, or will Rah's wrath obliterate the moon?\nOur modern reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Total Eclipse support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC. More releases are coming at a later date. Additionally, there are three playable demos if you want to test the game. Please contact us if you have some other release or demo.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.\n>",
