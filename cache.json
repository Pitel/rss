The game fell short of true greatness due to its less-than-stellar combat mechanics, which frankly brought the whole experience down a few pegs. In a lovely surprise, publisher PlayTonic Friends has shadow-dropped a spin-off called Demon Turf: Neon Splash; think of it like stand-alone DLC, if you will!\nUnlike the main game, Demon Turf: Neon Splash doesn’t feature any kind of hub area (though it does feature an optional “Playground” for you to hang out in and practice your moves). It’s far more content simply guiding the player through a series of linear levels, each more tricky than the last; make no mistake, some of the later levels can be fiendishly difficult. There are 10 normal levels in total, with an additional 10 remix levels that are even more brutal in their design.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

He invigorated Nintendo and brought many new eyes and faces into gaming, as new fans picked up controllers or developers, publishers, QA testers, etc. joined the industry because of his work.

This weekend, when you're chomping down on a hollow facsimile of a chicken oval, think of all the excellent eggs there have been across the years. Isn't that the true meaning of Easter, after all?

          "description": "Looks a bit meaty.\nQuite a lot of video games are violent, as we aim for headshots or pummel thugs, though Ravenous Devils still finds a way to push buttons in a different way. It's a game that describes itself as a 'psycho-horror cooking simulator', and makes sure you really deal with the violence on offer.\nPlaying out like a grisly horror movie concept, you run a pub and tailor business in 19th Century London, and due to spiralling meat and resource prices you obtain materials through other means. The game seems to play out as real-time resource management / strategy, and is undoubtedly rather gnarly (definitely an 18+).\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

New series, new films, new games; it's a bountiful time for fans of the final frontier. Star Trek: Picard is currently deep into its second season, with the full main cast of The Next Generation confirmed to be returning in Season 3, and the upcoming Star Trek: Strange New Worlds seems to be offering a return to the episodic planet-of-the-week-style format that fans of 'Legacy' Trek have been jonesing for.\nHowever, we recently stumbled across the beginnings of a fan project that loaded our torpedo bays with more nostalgia than that, even.

Soon Mario and co. began starring in sports games of different types. In the years that followed he took up baseball, soccer and even Dance Dance Revolution. His very first headlining foray in the world of sport came with Mario's Tennis on the Virtual Boy, though — an inauspicious start thanks to the commercial failure of that console. Undeterred, Nintendo threw the plumber a golf bag and shoved him out on the fairway in a game which took approximately two seconds to think up a title for.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Right now, you can pick up a beefy KFA2 OC card for the same price, after a £50 discount at Overclockers. \nIf you'd prefer the better value RTX 3080, then there's also been movement - after appearing for £860 seven days ago, the cheapest card is now this Zotac Trinity OC model for £810. That's still a hefty chunk of change for a graphics card - and above the original RRP of £650 - but it's a damned sight better than the £1000+ these GPUs have retailed at for months. \nRead more",

There would probably just be a disappointing invisible wall anyway.

Once every turn he could blink across the map, moving twice as far as he can with a regular action point, plopping him right behind a pesky Cultist’s cone of suppressing fire. It was both effective and efficient, but the real fireworks began whenever I clicked teleport strike, which repositioned him while also savaging several enemies in sequence with his power sword. He was simultaneously my initiator and my (almost) one-man clean up crew, ready to be rallied by a cry from my Justicar whenever his AP tank ran empty. I almost felt sorry for the cultists. \nI’ve played a curated, two hour slice of Warhammer 40K: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters, and I’m keen to play more. As speedy as my sword boy felt in those moments, though, at other times I felt compelled to move forward at a crawl. When I asked creative director Noah Decter-Jackson whether I was just being too cowardly, he hedged his bets. \nRead more",

Luckily I can link this to FixFox thematically, as a big exciting incident for the story involves waking up a man who was stuck in a cryopod. Around that, you, a fox called Vix, fix things in a post-apocalyptic sci-fi future where your tools are bananas and stamps.\nI was several hours into FixFox before I left it, and discovered it was much larger than I expected. It's paradoxically cosy and friendly even as its world is vast and strange. I had some minor annoyances with this - you do a lot of travelling around, and in the early stages of the game there aren't many fast travel options to mitigate this. But now I've been without it for two weeks, I've found myself missing the big spaces and warm welcomes of that world.\nRead more",

This isn’t so much a concern for the CPU’s structural integrity as it is a cooling issue, as a non-flat IHS will struggle to transfer heat to the CPU cooler plate as effectivity.\r\n\n\r\nIn a statement to Tom’s Hardware, however, an Intel spokesperson has essentially said it’s not as bad as it sounds. The statement does acknowledge the warping (or “deflection”, to use Intel’s more engineer-y term), but says there’s no evidence thus far to suggest it drives load temperatures up to unsafe levels.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Over the weekend, Square Enix surprise-announced Kingdom Hearts 4, the next big game in their incomprehensible RPG series which stars Disney cartoon characters as pop-punk boyband multiverse superheroes. I am mildly distressed to see KH4 lean towards a 'realistic' art style in parts, though I would be curious to see a Kingdom Hearts Mickey Mouse that's just a wee mouse wrapped in leather, plaid, buckles, and zips. While KH4 is largely a mystery for now, eagle-eyed viewers think the announcement trailer hints at a crossover with the Disney Princess world of Star Wars.\nRead more",

          "description": "2D bullet hell game Vampire Survivors is surely one of the most interesting success stories of the year, as what was a simple mobile game became popular almost overnight. Its very minimalistic roguelike style captured players looking for something casual, but still engrossing. You pick one of several characters and move them around the screen as they auto-attack. As enemies are disposed of the player levels up, along with changing weapons and gaining power-ups, with the ultimate goal being to keep the ever growing mob of enemies under control. On death you unlock new weapons and characters by spending coins gained in battle.\r\n\n\r\nWhile the game currently sits on Steam with an “overwhelmingly popular” based on almost 70k reviews, success is definitely not what solo developer Luca Galante was expecting when he first started working on it.\nRead more",

          "description": "When we were putting together our most anticipated games of 2022 list back in January, there was one game I knew had to be on it: Mojiken Studio’s A Space For The Unbound. It’s a slice of life adventure about two Indonesian high school students set in the late 90s, and the demo (which has recently been expanded to include the first chapter in addition to its short prologue) instantly captivated me when I first played it a couple of years ago. There are some light supernatural elements that will be instantly familiar to anyone who’s watched the films of Japanese anime directors Makoto Shinkai and Mamoru Hosoda (including a giant, ominous Your Name-style comet, no less), but for the most part this is a much more grounded game than Mojiken have made in the past, such as the fantastical point and click puzzlers She And The Light Bearer and When The Past Was Around. \nIndeed, the only game in their back catalogue that has a recognisable, real-life setting is their short, free browser game Banyu Lintar Angin. Born out of an internal game jam project in 2017, Banyu Lintar Angin once again draws inspiration from the studio’s home country of Indonesia. It only takes a couple of minutes to play, but speaking with its creator Dimas Novan, it was vital in sowing the seeds for what A Space For The Unbound would eventually become.\nRead more",

In the midst of a years-long components shortage, exacerbated by all manner of price-gouging bollocks, it’d be entirely understandable if upgrade-starved PC owners went for this like my cat goes for unattended crisp packets. Especially if they’re happy to stick to playing at 1080p.\r\n\n\r\nAlas, the RX 6500 XT isn’t just an inferior low-end option to the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 (one of the best graphics cards, and perhaps the outright best for budget builds right now). It’s an offputtingly slow, sometimes bizarrely-designed GPU in general; instead of providing long-overdue relief to a truly fudged hardware market, it ends up feeling like more an attempt to just sell any old second-rate kit to an audience that’s been left desperate for something, anything that’s new and somewhat affordable.\nRead more",

Sandrock may look more traditionally post-apocalyptic, being as it is a sandy outback populated by cowboys, but it's still got a helping-hands community feel at its core, plus an interesting eco-friendly angle and an all-new multiplayer mode.

          "description": "Regular readers will know that I have been complaining about moving to another country for some time. This move has now happened, but if you were hoping for an update on how I am getting on with a massive virtual jigsaw, you will be disappointed. Everything I own (bar the suitcase of clothes Mr. Ryanair allowed on the plane) has been held by customs. More monstrous is that my stuff actually cleared customs, but some absolute head-melter unrelated to me or my boxes of pens - and who, I am choosing to assume, tried to ship a load of high grade cocaine into Ireland - got the entire container stopped in Dublin.\nThis means that I have been without any TV for two weeks. Nor any books, video games, or even my big bag of crochet. We didn't get internet until two days ago. It is only by the grace of a technician looking at an HDMI cable stuck in our wall jack, stroking his chin, and then yanking the cable really hard that I'm talking to you now. In those two weeks, I discovered I am weak. But by a stroke of complete luck the new flat faces an busy shipping lane in an estuary. So I have also discovered a deep love for big boats and VesselFinder.\nRead more",

So far these have been given purely as Q2 2022, Q3 2022 and so on, but the Deck’s Steam store page will now list the actual months in that quarter – including your personal delivery estimate, if you’ve already got a reservation waiting.

          "description": "Chrono Cross was one of those Square JRPGs that never made its way to Europe at its original time of release. Heck, the first time I got to play time-travel classic Chrono Trigger was when the Nintendo DS version came out in 2009, almost 15 years after it first came out on the SNES. Chrono Cross, its semi-related but not direct sequel, has taken even longer to get here. First releasing on the original PlayStation in 1999 in Japan (and 2000 in the US), it's finally arriving on PC and modern consoles on April 7th as Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition, which bundles the original game with its accompanying text-based side story Radical Dreamers that only ever released on the ill-fated Satellaview. The latter's original 4:3 pixel art looks mildly ropey blown up on today's screens, but the main game has received all the modern conveniences you've come to expect from Square Enix's recent run of retro PC ports: new HD character models, re-orchestrated music, multiple font options, and the holy grail: a fast-forward button.\nI'm nowhere near the end yet, but from what I've played so far, Chrono Cross is a rollicking good time. There are dozens of characters to meet and recruit to your party that can tangibly change your path through the story, the turn-based battle system offers oodles of depth and variety, and Yasunori Mitsuda's revamped score is right up there with the Final Fantasy greats. For all its buff and polish, though, Chrono Cross has, sadly, also been struck by the same curse as other Square Enix PC ports. The lack of settings options makes it hard to pin down exactly what the problem is, but there's something about the performance and inconsistent frame rate of my review build that's so fundamentally borked that it's like those 22 years haven't even happened. If you, too, have been looking forward to Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition, I'd strongly advise waiting for a few patches to arrive before dipping your toes in.\nRead more",

Since benchmarking the AMD EPYC 7773X with its hefty 1.5GB of L3 cache for 2P servers via AMD 3D V-Cache, I've been curious to try this forthcoming kernel on that Milan-X configuration.

The main pain point this presents is for those using the latest-generation Intel \"Alder Lake\" processors with a mix of performance and power efficiency cores. My testing of Alder Lake this week on the latest Ubuntu 22.04 LTS build still shows that its 5.15-based experience being less than desirable with measurable -- often very significant -- improvements if using v5.16 or later.",

Here's hoping that the game can benefit greatly when transitioning to more powerful hardware and maybe even throwing in some extras knobs to turn for the PC crowd. I gave No More Heroes 3 a 7.75 out of 10 on the Game Informer scale.

Expect plenty of foliage to cover its monolithic surfaces, and 343 describes Catalyst as a vertical symmetrical arena featuring suspended catwalks and a light bridge connecting the map’s two halves. \nBreaker is a Banished shipyard laden with debris situated on a dusty desert planet. Its centerpiece element is a giant plasma cutting beam moving across the map that players can battle around at their own peril or benefit. 343 describes Breaker as a “pseudo symmetric BTB” map. Catalyst and Breaker will support all of the existing multiplayer modes as well as the new ones coming next season. You can watch a video fly-by of both arenas in the video below.\nClick here to watch embedded media\nBe sure to read 343's blog post for the developer's complete breakdown of these maps' inspirations and design elements. Lone Wolves will also introduce new story elements, modes, and cosmetics – 343 plans to spill the beans on those additions in the coming weeks. \nFor more on Halo Infinite, read about how longtime support studio Certain Affinity is deepening its relationship with 343.

Also known as the Lance Master in the Korean Lost Ark, the Glaivier is a Martial Artist subclass that specializes in using spears and glaives, poking enemies with dangerous sharp objects from a safe distance. She can use her special class ability to switch between stances while fighting.\nThe Glaivier already has a page on the official Lost Ark site that gives a brief description of its playstyle and shows shows off some of the skills you'll be utilizing on the battlefield. Here's Lost Ark's description of the new subclass:\n\"The Glaivier has two distinct skill sets, each one is represented by one of her weapons, the spear and the glaive. The best way to leverage her eloquent, yet deadly form of martial arts is to find balance between her two stances.\"\nIf the April 21 date is truly the release of the Glaivier, we'll be swinging big deadly polearms in all kinds of badass ways in a week's time. If you're new to Lost Ark, its an isometric online action/RPG that you can download and play for free on Steam. I gave the game an 8.25 out of 10 in my review which you can read here.

The studio has previously released Enhanced Editions of Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Neverwinter Nights, and Planescape: Torment. Most recently, Beamdog developed an online edition of the strategy board game Axis and Allies 1942.\nAspyr also has its hands in remastering and releasing games. The developer/publisher has been bringing back Star Wars games from the recently bygone eras, such as Star Wars: Episode I – Racer, Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast, Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy, and the upcoming port of Star Wars: The Force Unleashed on Switch. While most of these games are straightforward ports, Aspyr is developing a from-the-ground-up remake of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, which was announced at The Game Awards last year.\nMythForce, the project tying these studios together before the acquisition, is a four-player first-person fantasy roguelite with art designed to resemble a Saturday morning cartoon. Check out the trailer for it in our story from its announcement yesterday. Mythforce enters Early Access exclusively on the Epic Games Store on April 20.",

Although infection numbers have generally fallen in recent months, many companies continue to exercise caution when it comes to organizing public gatherings and Quakecon is one of them. The show's organizers have announced that for the third year in a row, Quakecon 2022 will be a digital-only event.\nIn a post to Twitter, the organizers revealed that Quakecon will take place August 18-20 with more details to come in June. They explain that the constant uncertainty around holding large gatherings this year made it hard to commit to putting a show together in the time required. Quakecon will return to its normal in-person state in 2023, however. You can read the full statement below:\nQuakecon was a digital event in 2020 and 2021, with last year’s show being free to attend. This news isn't far removed from E3 2022's outright cancellation last month due to similar concerns, though this month's PAX East has committed to being a physical convention.

Now he’ll be penning the screenplay for Ghost of Tsushima’s big-screen adaptation, which is helmed by John Wick director Chad Stahelski. Alex Young and Jason Spitz of 87Eleven Entertainment serve as producers with PlayStation Productions overseeing the entire project. \nThe Ghost of Tsushima film is in very early development, with Stahlski saying in December that he intends to take his time with the movie in order to “do it right.” The film crew is said to be working closely with the game’s developer, Sucker Punch. Stahlski is a fan of Ghost and was inspired to make the movie after playing the game “many times.”\nWe still don’t know anything in regards to casting (though the voice actor for protagonist Jin Sakai raised his hand in humorous fashion) and it will likely be a while before we see anything substantial from the project. But it’s nice to see the pieces slowly fall into place. Video game movies have generally improved over the last few years, so we hope that Ghost of Tsushima continues the trend when it is eventually released.\n[Source: Deadline]",

Releasing in two parts, the season's first full-length trailer sets the table for dangers new and old the heroes of Hawkins must contend with. \nThe story picks up several months after the events of 2019's Season 3. A powerless Eleven and the Byers family have moved to California. Hopper is being held captive in Russia. Our remaining friends must pick up the pieces while starting high school. Naturally, the ongoing supernatural menace and the sinister government conspiracy attached to it continue to haunt the world’s unluckiest small town. Per a warning to Eleven in the trailer: “a war is coming. Your friends in Hawkins are very much in the eye of a storm.”\nClick here to watch embedded media\nStranger Things 4 consists of nine episodes, each with a runtime twice as long as before. Because the episodes are supersized, they’ll be divided and released in two batches that are five weeks apart. Volume 1 premieres on May 27, and Volume 2 arrives on July 1. It's unknown how many episodes are in each volume, but one would imagine it's a clean split, so four/five each. \nEarlier this year, Netflix renewed Stranger Things for a 5th and final season. The last season currently has no premiere date. For more on Stranger Things, you can read about its recent crossovers with Far Cry 6 and Magic: The Gathering.",
