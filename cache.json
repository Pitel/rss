          "description": "No calumniations from us.\nNIS America has released a brand new trailer for their absolutely bonkers-looking murder mystery shmup (yes, really) Yurukill: The Calumniation Games. Penned by famous manga writer Homura Kawamoto, the game sees a group of convicted detainees at the Yurukill land, a twisted amusement park headed up by the mysterious guide Binko. These detainees and their partners, called \"Executioners\", must solve puzzles in order to prove their innocence and escape the park.\nIt's impossible to overstate just how jam-packed this game looks. With a Danganronpa-esque killing game premise, tense puzzle sections straight out of the Zero Escape games, and bullet hell segments created by G.rev, veteran shmup developer of Border Down, Dariusburst Another Chronicle EX+, and Under Defeat HD, there's nothing else like it. We get a glimpse of those vertical shooter sections in the above trailer, too, and they look every bit as polished as we'd expect.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Comparing digital to skyrocketing physical prices.\nSome 3DS games are super cheap to buy physically, which makes sense considering the success of the system. There are others, however, which have seen their secondhand prices shoot up in recent years. It's easy enough to find copies of big-selling first-party titles at acceptable prices (even if that means playing near-enough original RRP for your Pokémons), but other games have really shot up in price in a relatively short space of time.\n\nFeature: 29 Best 3DS eShop Games You Should Get Before They're Gone Forever\n\nWe've covered quite thoroughly the digital-only games we think are worth picking up before the 3DS, DSi and Wii U stores close up shop forever in March 2023, but we thought it was worth taking a brief look at the prices of retail games versus their digital counterparts. While it might seem counter-intuitive for lovers of physical media to resort to digital downloads — especially from a store which is soon closing its digital doors — physical prices will only increase once the digital version is no longer available. Pleasantly, it seems that Nintendo has reprinted various retail releases, so you should be able to find the most popular games for a while yet. Still, the clock is ticking, especially for the not-Kirbys and the not-Zeldas.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

One of the more ongoing problems has been fans' issues with Mega Evolutions. Introduced back in 2020 and taken right from generation 6's Pokémon X and Y, this mechanic is a temporary evolution method that changes your Pocket Monster's appearance, stats, and sometimes even typing.\nWhen it debuted in the mobile game, players were required to use Mega Energy to unlock the ability, but this only lasted four hours, so you also had to keep using it to maintain it beyond that. Unfortunately, this resource was handed out too infrequently so players quickly ran out. And while this has been fixed to some degree, you still need to go through Mega Raids and keep topped up on Mega Energy.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The game is charming and breezy, offering plenty of locales and set pieces fans of the force will fawn over. Yet its episodes are wildly inconsistent, with stories told at lightspeed and open world hubs filled with so many collectible bricks it solidifies your brain to a lump of mortar.\nRead more",

          "description": "Regular readers will know that I have been complaining about moving to another country for some time. This move has now happened, but if you were hoping for an update on how I am getting on with a massive virtual jigsaw, you will be disappointed. Everything I own (bar the suitcase of clothes Mr. Ryanair allowed on the plane) has been held by customs. More monstrous is that my stuff actually cleared customs, but some absolute head-melter unrelated to me or my boxes of pens - and who, I am choosing to assume, tried to ship a load of high grade cocaine into Ireland - got the entire container stopped in Dublin.\nThis means that I have been without any TV for two weeks. Nor any books, video games, or even my big bag of crochet. We didn't get internet until two days ago. It is only by the grace of a technician looking at an HDMI cable stuck in our wall jack, stroking his chin, and then yanking the cable really hard that I'm talking to you now. In those two weeks, I discovered I am weak. But by a stroke of complete luck the new flat faces an busy shipping lane in an estuary. So I have also discovered a deep love for big boats and VesselFinder.\nRead more",

So far these have been given purely as Q2 2022, Q3 2022 and so on, but the Deck’s Steam store page will now list the actual months in that quarter – including your personal delivery estimate, if you’ve already got a reservation waiting.

          "description": "Chrono Cross was one of those Square JRPGs that never made its way to Europe at its original time of release. Heck, the first time I got to play time-travel classic Chrono Trigger was when the Nintendo DS version came out in 2009, almost 15 years after it first came out on the SNES. Chrono Cross, its semi-related but not direct sequel, has taken even longer to get here. First releasing on the original PlayStation in 1999 in Japan (and 2000 in the US), it's finally arriving on PC and modern consoles on April 7th as Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition, which bundles the original game with its accompanying text-based side story Radical Dreamers that only ever released on the ill-fated Satellaview. The latter's original 4:3 pixel art looks mildly ropey blown up on today's screens, but the main game has received all the modern conveniences you've come to expect from Square Enix's recent run of retro PC ports: new HD character models, re-orchestrated music, multiple font options, and the holy grail: a fast-forward button.\nI'm nowhere near the end yet, but from what I've played so far, Chrono Cross is a rollicking good time. There are dozens of characters to meet and recruit to your party that can tangibly change your path through the story, the turn-based battle system offers oodles of depth and variety, and Yasunori Mitsuda's revamped score is right up there with the Final Fantasy greats. For all its buff and polish, though, Chrono Cross has, sadly, also been struck by the same curse as other Square Enix PC ports. The lack of settings options makes it hard to pin down exactly what the problem is, but there's something about the performance and inconsistent frame rate of my review build that's so fundamentally borked that it's like those 22 years haven't even happened. If you, too, have been looking forward to Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition, I'd strongly advise waiting for a few patches to arrive before dipping your toes in.\nRead more",

          "description": "Halo Infinite officially launched last December, receiving rave reviews from critics and fans - including Brendan’s review here at RPS. It peaked with over 200k viewers on Twitch. And for many content creators like Kevin Lynch, aka KevinKoolx, December marked their best month ever in terms of engagement on YouTube and Twitch. Halo, after a decade of somewhat divisive releases, was back. It’s hard to overstate how impressive a feat this was, since the Halo fanbase is almost as divided as the Star Wars one - a seemingly trivial topic like the inclusion of sprint is just one of many decade-long points of contention. But somehow with Halo Infinite 343 Industries created an experience that almost every type of Halo fan could rally behind. But now, just four months after launch, Infinite is struggling to retain its playerbase.\r\n\n Now the Twitch peaks are below 10k and dropping, with the averages even lower. Lynch says February was his worst month views-wise in over a year. You'd expect some tail off after launch for any game, but every content creator I’ve spoken to echoes this sentiment: engagement for Infinite is abnormally low for a live service-game at the beginning of its multi-year journey, especially for a franchise as big as this. The game plays great, so what’s the problem? I spoke to a number of different streamers and content creators to get their point of view.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Firstly, that Kojima's bonkers hiking postal sim is still one of the best open world games around. If you haven't read my full thoughts on the new Director's Cut, please do consider having a gander. The second most important thing is that Death Stranding's photo mode remains just glorious, brilliant fun, and it therefore felt appropriate, nay, necessary to give my good old BB Boys another trip for the album. \nRead more",

By comparison, April 2022 almost seems a little light when it comes to new PC releases. Only one AAA blockbuster launching this month? How quaint. \r\n\n\r\nStill, this relatively quiet period finally gives indie games a chance to breathe again. There are a ton of super interesting, smaller titles launching on PC this month that I’m excited to share with you all today. From epic turn-based RPGs based on English mythology to offbeat walking simulators about free will, there’s something for everyone launching on PC this month.\r\n\n \nRead more",

For example, there's probably a generally accepted term for RPGs about traipsing around dungeons killing rats, while turning and moving strictly at 90 degree angles. But I actually typed out \"Dungeons of Gridlock\" because I genuinely thought that's what Legend Of Grimrock was called. For once, I am not trying to annoy fans of a thing I generally hate.\nThat's because I've been playing Potato Flowers In Full Bloom, which is very much one of those games.

          "description": "The Steam Deck’s battery life isn’t one of its best qualities. While this weakness is outweighed by the pleasures of playing PC games in bed or on the bus, most such games will drain the Deck quickly, requiring a degree of foresight if you want to entertain yourself on a long trip away from mains power. At the same time, different games will drain at different speeds, with some allowing Valve’s handheld to last hours longer than others.\r\n\n\r\nUltimately, I think the only truly accurate way to measure and judge the Steam Deck’s battery life is to test a bunch of different games to see how long it lasts with each. So I have! Here you’ll find a list of games with how long they took to empty the Deck’s battery from full. I’ll be coming back and adding more to the list as I test them, so you can see for yourself what uptimes to expect from your favourites.\r\n\n \nRead more",

In richer moments, it flips your expectations with a huge scene-changing gag that solicits a hearty giggle. Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is more mix for the bag. It's a loots-be-shoot with a moreish loop urging you onward, boasting characterful art design and thick-lined scenery goading you to pause for yet another snap in photo mode. For Borderlikers, the gun compulsion and farty japes will be enough. It exists as a handsome world to roam through with pals, half-listening to dialogue while Paula chews toast and Jeremy complains about work. As that, Tinalands is fine.

          "description": "Diablo meets The Boys is the four-word elevator pitch of Stitch Heads and Raw Fury's new isometric hack and slasher - and judging from the amount of loot, blood and minced limbs I saw in my hands on demo last week, I'd say they're pretty bang on the money, albeit with an extra dash of Borderlands thanks to its cel-shaded comic book visuals. Whichever way you slice it, though, Superfuse makes a striking and violent first impression. \nPerhaps it's because I'm playing as its Berserker class, a large walking slab of man muscle whose axe and (comically large) fists can pulverise anything and everything standing in its way. Or maybe it's because the devs have given me free rein of the game's extensive skill tree, letting me pile in dozens of points into attacks, abilities and power-ups normally reserved for later on. Superfuse may be a loot-driven hack and slash with hundreds of different weapons and armour components to pick from, but its skill tree is equally vast, giving you as much flexibility in how your attacks play out onscreen as your various wardrobe choices - and some of its effects are deliciously gory.\nRead more",

It’s a concise expression of everything the town’s been through: the rampaging bandits, the cannibal kidnappings, the swirling tornados. Filling the graveyard has been a solemn bid for order in the wake of so much chaos.\nIt’s not that way in Bripton, the next town over. The graveyard there is uncannily empty, save for a similarly bare tree. But you can change that, should you so choose: shoot up the bank or fight a duel and, the next time you return to that settlement, new plots will have appeared for every life snuffed out. Weird West even suggests you head to the local cemetery to loot any bodies you’ve missed - though its reputational system implies you should ensure nobody’s watching first.\nRead more",

It's a roguelike DOOM-inspired shooter where you blast through procedurally-generated levels and their demonic denizens, earn cash, put points into a skill-tree, and get as far as you can.

          "description": "It's a strange thing, returning to the world of Death Stranding after more than a year away. Having done that classic thing of rinsing almost every last delivery out of it before finally strapping myself in for its rollercoaster ending back in 2020, there hasn't been much reason to return to my precious, daft BB Boys in the intervening months - not even its Cyberpunk 2077 crossover was enough to tempt me back. At long last, though, I have cause to load up the BB train again. Death Stranding Director's Cut arrives on Steam and the Epic Games Store today, bringing with it new story missions, new delivery buddies, new weapons and... a Mario Kart-style race track? Yep, that sounds like a classic Kojima upgrade pack, if you ask me. Not quite as revolutionary as Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence, mind, but it's roughly in the same kind of ballpark. \nIt's been great fun revisiting the lush mountains of Death Stranding's definitely not Icelandic version of post-apocalyptic America. If anything, the weirdest thing is seeing that same world I know and love on a fresh server, bereft of all the distracting neon signs, yelps of \"Keep on keeping on!\" and one-upmanship bridge-building that made up the bulk of the original's asymmetric online multiplayer component. It's actually quite refreshing to see these virgin, unspoiled landscapes again, although I imagine this won't last long once returning players flock back to their well-worn delivery routes. As for the new new stuff, is it worth making a return trip? As with all expando games, the answer will very much depend on if and how much you played the first one. \nRead more",

          "description": "After months of rumours, Sony have finally unveiled their answer to Xbox Game Pass today. Starting this June, their new subscription service will unite PlayStation Plus and their cloud streaming platform PlayStation Now under one roof, offering three different tiers of membership. Most of it isn't that relevant to us on PC, but the final, most expensive tier, PlayStation Plus Premium, will include that aforementioned cloud streaming to PC, letting us play hundreds of PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4 and PSP games without having to own an actual PlayStation.\nIt's not yet clear how that library of games will differ from the current PlayStation Now library, but one thing is certain: this is a move that definitely benefits people with a PlayStation and a PC more than it does standalone PC peeps. And yet, even as someone who falls into the former camp of PlayStation and PC owners, I'm still not sure this new PS+ is something I actually want. Sure, there's that massive retro collection on offer, but no Day One games I can either play on my console or stream to PC? On your bike, Sony. Personally, I see this as more of a dip-in and dip-out kinda deal to indulge my occasional retro cravings, but I'm keen to know what you, RPS readers, think of this new PS Plus offering as well. Does it appeal in any shape or form? And how does it compare to Game Pass for you? Let's chat about it below. \nRead more",

Just two weeks after AMD confirmed a date and price for their own champion, the Ryzen 7 5800X3D, Intel have formally unveiled the Core i9-12900KS: a new addition to the 12th Gen Alder Lake lineup that promises superlative performance and up to 5.5GHz clock speeds.\r\n\n\r\nThat’s all less than five months since the launch of the original Intel Core i9-12900K, which as far as I can tell actually is the best CPU for gaming right now in pure performance terms. And the Core i9-12900KS is even set to beat the Ryzen 7 5800X3D to shelves, releasing on April 5th to the Ryzen’s April 20th street date. No brakes on the top-tier processor train, it seems.\r\n\n \nRead more",

You're a Prospector, tasked with descending into Fortuna 3, an alien planet filled with minerals and plant matter and dinosaurs. Corpos hire you to get these goods and bring them back safely. The catch is other players and inconvenient helicopter schedules. Other Prospectors will murder you for your precious rocks and weeds, so your aim is to get a helicopter out of Fortuna before this happens. It's a setup where success breeds success in its current closed beta form, but failure also begets frustration. In the end, you might wish Fortuna was yours and yours alone.\nRead more",

Every day you wake up, leave your apartment and hit the streets, chatting to the locals, picking up a bit of info, even gambling a bit. The folks you meet are from the shadier side of society and they'll hire you for jobs. Sometimes it’s simple burglary, sometimes it's breaking a vase, or snatching a specific bit of loot. There’s even a guy who keeps trying to offer me wet work! It all boils down to the same thing though: sneaking around some rich guy’s place, disabling the security, avoiding or taking down the occupants, and getting out without being caught. Afterwards, I fence the loot and head to bed.\nIt's all building up to Abermore's central heist: The Feast of the Lucky Few. It's also my only chance to rescue the famous Hanged Man, a dame I met on the boat over here. They're the thief of thieves! A living legend! But the tyrant king grabbed her before we got ashore and she’ll be executed in eighteen days if I don’t break her out. That’s eighteen nights to prepare, eighteen jobs to build the resources, the connections I need for the heist of a life time. A terrible shame, then, that alarm bells started ringing almost as soon as I started playing.\nRead more",

You see, in Patrick's line of work, his cubes contain multitudes, to misquote that famous Walt Whitman line. As long as they're resting against a hard surface, cubes can be packed into other cubes in Patrick's Parabox like a stack of matryoshka dolls. They can also be unpacked in the same way, allowing him to navigate the tight constraints of his respective puzzle arenas with surprising dexterity. It's like he's discovered the TARDIS of sokoban-style cube-pushing, if you will, and cor, just imagine what Wilmot could do with such technology. That warehouse would be immaculate. \nRead more",

Mimo jiné v souboru s GIF obrázkem smazal nepovinnou tabulku barev, uložil jej jako nový obrázek a ten zkoušel v různých webových prohlížečích a grafických aplikacích. Dle autora nuda. Pokaždé se zobrazil černý obdélník. Zmíněný příspěvek na blogu se dostal na Hacker News a uživatelé Firefoxu na Linuxu místo černého obdélníku viděli ve Firefoxu obdélníkový výřez aneb díru, skrze kterou lze vidět obrázek na ploše nebo jinou aplikaci.

Takže proč nevyužít dlouhé dny pro nějaké to domácí bastlení? A proč si o něm navíc nepopovídat? Ano, uhádli jste, po měsíci opět přichází strahovská Virtuální Bastlírna. I naše dílna ožila provozem, krom opravené pásové brusky se nám po dlouhé době povedlo zprovoznit CNC frézku a protože běží na linuxovém real time jádře, mohla by zajímat i Vás. Krom toho jsme se dozvěděli o společnosti Dymo a jejich DRM-chráněných páskách a o českém otevřeném securečipu z dílen TropicSquare, takže témat k pokecu bude víc než dost. Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve čtvrtek 7. dubna od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končíme o dost později). Ať už něco chcete ukázat nebo máte jenom téma k diskuzi, vyplňte prosím dotazník. Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

          "description": "Video game movies have a relatively checkered history. The highs and lows have been well-documented, but the Sonic movie franchise has been a source of happiness for gamers looking to see their favorite titles on the big screen. Sonic The Hedgehog 2 continues that trend of good video game movies, and we're sitting down with the cast and crew to find out how they did it.\nClick here to watch embedded media\nJoin Brian Shea as he sits down with Ben Schwartz, James Marsden, Colleen O'Shaughnessey, and director Jeff Fowler to discuss all the things fans should look forward to in Sonic The Hedgehog 2. To kick things off, Ben and James chat with Shea about what it was like to film the live-action scenes when the former basically had to imagine his furry companion being alongside him. Ben also discusses some of his favorite Sonic games of all time and what moments he'd want to see in a future film.\nFrom there, we move to Colleen to discuss what it's like joining the stacked cast for the first time. She has been the voice of Tails for years through the games and TV series, but this is the first time she's getting to bring her character to life on the big screen. Finally, we sit down with Jeff Fowler to discuss bringing all those pieces together and delivering an experience Sonic fans are hoping for.\nDid you enjoy today's video but are curious if Sonic The Hedgehog 2 is actually worth seeing? Our own Brian Shea has seen it, and in his review, he says:\n\"Paramount's Sonic the Hedgehog 2 movie expands the universe established by its predecessor and delivers a better overall film thanks to bigger action setpieces, laugh-out-loud gags, and some terrific fanservice moments.\"\n\nThanks as always for watching.

          "description": "Remedy Entertainment is returning to the franchise that made the studio a noteworthy name in the game industry and will remake Max Payne and Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne. The announcement comes with word that Remedy has struck an agreement with Rockstar Games to develop the remake.\nThe deal is for Remedy to make one big remake encompassing both classic Max Payne titles. The game will be targeting a release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC and will utilize its Northlight game engine. Rockstar will be fronting the bill for development, which will be budgeted to be \"in line with a typical Remedy AAA-game production,\" according to a press release provided by Remedy. Remedy will collect royalties on the game after Rockstar has recouped its funding from development and publishing. No release window for the project was given. \nRemedy CEO Tero Virtala remarked on the agreement, saying, \"We're hugely excited to be working with our partners at Rockstar Games once again for the chance to bring the story, action and atmosphere of the original Max Payne games back to players in new ways.\" \nTake-Two, the parent company of Rockstar, owns the rights to the Max Payne IP, and Rockstar itself developed Max Payne 3, which was released in 2012. Remedy and Apogee Software sold the rights to the series for $10 million in cash and stock shares in 2002, a year prior to the release of Max Payne 2.  \nRemedy Entertainment's most recent games include Control, the campaign of Crossfire X, and Alan Wake Remastered. The studio is currently developing Alan Wake 2, a multiplayer game with Tencent codenamed Vanguard, and a multiplayer Control spin-off.",

Here's what it says:\nWith over four months of advance notice, there's no excuse to miss THQ Nordic's series of summer announcements. The festivities begin at 12 p.m. Pacific on August 12.

This pursuit of power will also net you other items, including classic stadiums. You can get a Choice Stadium pack by playing horribly in one Mini Season game.\nAll you have to do is complete three errors in the span of one three-inning game to complete the \"Are you even trying?\" mystery mission. Adding terrible fielders to your roster isn't necessary; all you have to do is make terrible throws to first base. You'll likely lose the game, but you'll walk away with a classic stadium in return. The challenge expires on May 2, 2022.\nI played the game on Legend difficulty to ensure the CPU would make good contact. I lost the game 27 to zip. Yes, it took that long for three legitimate ground balls to be put into play.\nFor more on MLB The Show 22, check out our review in progress. This year's game is quite good on new-gen machines yet struggles mightily in the tech department on Switch. This is the first time the game is on Nintendo's platform, and it just isn't as smooth or polished as the other versions.",

The post shares a quote from Shiro Games CEO Sebastien Videl. He says, \"With so many massive Dune fans in the studio, the excitement I see every day of working with this universe is very real, and we hope this comes across in the game. With all this passion for the source material, and all the know-how we've gathered from making Northgard, we can't wait to put this game into players' hands.\" \nAs for the addition of the Fremen to Spice Wars, this marks the first time the now Arrakis-natives will be a main playable faction in any Dune strategy game to date. The Fremen are led by Liet Kynes, who holds dueling allegiances to her people and to the emperor as a planetologist. Her faction interacts with the harsh deserts of Arrakis more favorably than the feuding houses and smugglers they will contend against. The Fremen can move through the sands further before succumbing to exhaustion or attracting massive sandworms. They specialize in stealth and guerilla tactics and can make use of and ally with neutral territories.\nSpice Wars isn't the only game making use of the Dune property in development under Funcom. The publisher is also working with German studio Nukklear on an open-world survival multiplayer game set in the Dune universe.\nYou can play Dune: Spice Wars, the 4X and real-time strategy hybrid, later this month when it hits Early Access on PC through Steam.",

          "description": "Following a brief stint at NetherRealm Studios last year, the game director of Days Gone at Sony's Bend Studio has announced he has started work at Crystal Dynamics. \nIn a Tweet posted today, Ross repromoted a host of job openings at Crystal Dynamics and, at the same time, revealed he is working as a design director for the company. \"I'm excited to announce I now work at the amazing Crystal Dynamics as Design Director. That's all I can say other than I'm thrilled with the project, and especially the team of really wonderful people,\" says Ross in the Tweet. \nI'm excited to announce I now work at the amazing Crystal Dynamics as Design Director. That's all I can say other than I'm thrilled with the project, and especially the team of really wonderful people.\nhttps://t.co/HjDFIFk7MF\nApril 5, 2022\nRoss leaves a palpable mystery hanging of which project he's attached to. We now know of two upcoming projects that Crystal Dynamics is working on: the just-announced Tomb Raider game running on Unreal Engine 5 and Xbox and The Initiative's new Perfect Dark title, which Crystal Dynamics was announced to be assisting with development in September 2021.\nWhether Jeff Ross is working on either of those projects or something else entirely is unknown. It seems the studio isn't lacking in exciting projects at the moment. Considering the call for more developers to join the team, Crystal Dynamics looks to be staffing up appropriately. \nCrystal Dynamic's most recent release is the live service superhero team-up Marvel's Avengers, which has seen its share of troubled development while revamping many of the game's progression systems and releasing new characters and content expansions since its release in 2020.\nOther than Days Gone, Ross was heavily involved in the design for most of the Syphon Filter series and Resistance: Retribution. Earlier this year, he spoke openly about his time developing Days Gone and the lack of a green light for a sequel despite the game selling millions of copies.",

In it, nine teenage camp counselors are left overnight at Hackett Quarry, free of kids, supervision, and most importantly to the tropes Supermassive is riffing on rules. \nAs expected, things go awry and people start to die as “something far more sinister” begins to hunt them throughout the night, according to a press release from the studio. It will be up to you to control and interact with characters played by actors like David Arquette (the Scream series), Lin Shaye (A Nightmare on Elm Street, Insidious), Ted Raimi (the Evil Dead Series, Candyman, The Grudge), Ariel Winter (Modern Family), Justice Smith (Detective Pikachu), and Brenda Song (The Suite Life of Zack and Cody, Dollface), amongst others. \nIf you’re interested to see what all of this looks like in action, you now can, thanks to 30 minutes of gameplay from The Quarry’s gameplay, which is now live over on IGN as part of the publication’s month-long coverage of Supermassive Games’ latest. You can watch it below: \nClick here to watch embedded media\nFor more about The Quarry, be sure to read about the reveal of it from last month, and then check out this story about how Supermassive Games wants to avoid problematic tropes in The Quarry.  \nAre you excited for The Quarry?

However, if you’re looking for anything more about the game, that’s sadly all that was shared. \nCrystal Dynamics is incredibly excited about the future of Unreal and how it will help us take our storytelling to the next level. That's why we're proud to announce that our next #tombraider game is being built on Unreal Engine 5! pic.twitter.com/UFMiWzJAZc\nApril 5, 2022\nHere’s what was announced, in full, by Crystal Dynamics’ Tomb Raider franchise general manager Dallas Dickinson: \nAs for what to expect from this Tomb Raider game, it will likely continue the story of the recent trilogy from Crystal Dynamics (with help from Eidos-Montréal on the final entry). However, that’s pure speculation – there’s always the possibility that Crystal Dynamics could reboot Tomb Raider once more, just like it did in 2013. However, the studio always referred to its trilogy reboot as an origin story for its Lara Croft so perhaps this new Unreal Engine 5-powered Tomb Raider will be the first game in the reboot’s timeline where Lara Croft is the tomb raider many think of when they hear the words “Tomb Raider.” Only time will tell. \nFor now, read about everything announced during today’s Unreal Engine 5 presentation, and then read Game Informer’s thoughts on the most recent Tomb Raider game in our Shadow of the Tomb Raider review. \nAre you excited for a new Tomb Raider game?

In Dreamsettler, you'll play as an internet private detective trying to solve problems for other users on the Somnius Sleepnet Systems. There will be all kinds of familiar references while surfing this shifted reality version of a burgeoning time for the web. You'll experience an early version of social media, listen to alternate-reality genres of music, and explore a version of the 00s internet that's much like our own but with some abnormalities. Although, No More Robots hints it will get weirder as it gets even darker.\nClick here to watch embedded media\nAlso announced is Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengance of the Slayer, a spinoff of sorts from the original Hypnospace outlaw starring ZANE_ROCKS_14, or Zane Lofton as he's known in the fictional real world. In 2022, 37-year-old Zane, who is now a manager at a DollarSaver, finds a game he made when he was 14 called Slayers X. Naturally, he decides to rerelease his boomer shooter (its very Doom-like) in 2022 with some upgrades. \nBoth games are slated to release sometime this year and will be coming to consoles and PC, but neither title has a date yet. \nAre you looking forward to playing these Hypnospace Outlaw spinoffs?

For that reason, it’s easy to imagine a sequel or follow-up to it, even though it does end quite nicely, all things considered. However, it doesn’t sound like one is in the cards. \nIn a new interview with Edge magazine, Tales of Arise producer Yusuke Tomiwaza said that a sequel isn’t happening, as reported by GamesRadar. Tomiwaza alluded to the team developing Arise in such a way that a sequel wouldn’t be necessary, citing that he hoped the story would be complete “with a good aftertaste” when players roll credits, eliminating the need for a sequel altogether. \nClick here to watch embedded media\nTomizawa continued, citing that the studio wants “to continue to take on the challenge of…acquiring new fans for further expansion of JRPGs,” and that in order to do that, “we need to come up with a cutting-edge flagship title that builds on the success of Arise, while also providing an opportunity to rediscover the history of the series.” \nAs GamesRadar points out, a lack of a sequel to Arise isn’t necessarily the worst news ever for fans because as fans of the series likely know, we’re probably just a few years away from another Tales game. Having been around for more than two decades, with 17 mainline games in it, it’s safe to say another Tales game is likely on the way. \nWhile waiting for that, read Game Informer’s Tales of Arise review and then check out why it’s on Game Informer’s list of the top 10 RPGs to play right now. Read about this stylish Tales of Arise and Scarlet Nexus crossover after that. \n[Source: GamesRadar]\nDo you want a sequel to Tales of Arise? Let us know why in the comments below!",

Titles from Final Fantasy, the Mana series, and more have found their way onto consoles such as the Nintendo Switch, providing an excellent history lesson to those who want to understand the foundations of contemporary RPGs. Chrono Cross is next on the list, and on this episode of New Gameplay Today, we're taking a look at the fan-favorite title and letting you know how The Radical Dreamers Edition holds up.\nClick here to watch embedded media\nJoin host Alex Stadnik and JRPG-expert Kim \"KStar\" Wallace as they take you on a tour of the game's remastered opening hours. They highlight all the changes Square Enix has implemented, including graphics switching, speeding up gameplay, and so much more. They also chat about the visual improvements of The Radical Dreamers Edition and whether or not newcomers or veterans will enjoy this return to the beloved series.\nFinally, they also discuss some of the technical issues they've run into. While the game is playable, the frame rate takes noticeable dips from time to time, and both Kim and Stadnik noticed the game can be stuttery during their hands-on time with the Switch version. Is it enough to derail the experience?

As for why, PlayStation leadership reportedly cited a “global transformation” of the company’s sales and business operations in the U.S. and elsewhere. \nThe cuts, which have not been publicly disclosed by Sony or its PlayStation arm, happened last week, one laid-off employee told Axios. More specifically, documents reveal Sony PlayStation is ending its “merchandiser” team in the U.S., with roles like PlayStation Representatives and more terminated. These employees were often responsible for going to brick-and-mortar stores to sell PlayStation products and educate employees there on those products.\nMultiple retail marketing jobs were cut as well, according to Axios. One worker laid off told the publication that they felt the company could have done more to find laid-off employees alternate jobs within it. They also said they were disappointed PlayStation had not told the affected departments sooner than they did.\n[Source: Axios]",

Then, some began to speculate that somehow, Hideo Kojima was behind Abandoned and Blue Box – Blue Box was seen as “BB,” like the term used throughout Death Stranding. Despite Blue Box saying it was not associated with Hideo Kojima, the studio leaned into it, posting an image of a hidden face with a very Metal Gear Solid-esque eye patch. \nBlue Box reiterated that it was not associated with Kojima and a few days later, people spotted another tie between the famed director and the studio. Things subsided for a few weeks and then Blue Box posted yet another thing that caused people to further speculate on the Blue Box-Kojima connection.

Are you ready to encounter Arceus & Darkrai in #PokemonBrilliantDiamond & #PokemonShiningPearl?\nhttps://t.co/mMc6VanOif pic.twitter.com/f96Z5WpI7W\nMarch 16, 2022\n“The Member Card item will be given as a gift between Friday, April 1 and Sunday, May 1, 2022 at 11:59 p.m. (JST),” an official blog post reads. “After obtaining the item by selecting ‘Get via Internet’ from the Mystery Gift feature in-game and fulfilling specific conditions – such as entering the Hall of Fame and obtaining the National Pokédex – players will be able to go to Newmoon Island, where the Mythical Pokémon Darkrai can be found.” \nAs noted above, if you’re wanting to get Darkrai in the Sinnoh remakes, you’ll need to act fast as the Darkrai Mystery Gift Member Card is live for less than a month at this point. Be sure to pick it up before May 1 to add it to your Pokédex. \nFor more about Pokémon, read about Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet, which are coming to Switch in “late 2022.” After that, check out our running list of every Pokémon confirmed for Scarlet and Violet, and then read Game Informer’s review of Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl. \nAre you going to pick up Darkrai this month?

Some of his attacks were less frequent, it seemed, but more noticeably, his attacks didn’t do near as much damage as pre-patch Radahn. However, it turns out this nerf was unintentional because in a new update out today, From Software calls it a bug that’s now been fixed. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n“Fixed a bug in the balance adjustment of the boss ‘Starscourge Radahn’ in update 1.03, in which the power of some attacks was unintentionally reduced,” the patch notes read. \nAs you can see, From Software is very clearly referring to the Radahn nerf as unintentional and also a bug that was never meant to occur. We haven’t yet fought Radahn since this update, but we’re excited (and scared) to see what the fight is like now. \nIt’s important to note that today’s update is an update to a previously-released patch: Patch 1.03. As a result, this update does not do anything else for Elden Ring – it simply fixes the Radahn balance and that’s it. For reference, Patch 1.03 was released in March and this update is live as of today, April 4, 2022. \nFor more about Elden Ring, read Game Informer’s Elden Ring Beginner’s Guide, which features nine essential tips and tricks for new players, and then check out this guide on how to beat every boss in Elden Ring easily.

This week we're putting on the diving suit and exploring Bioshock 2. \nBioshock 2 launched in February 2010 with developer 2K Marin, led by former Irrational employees who departed the studio after Bioshock 1's release, given barely two years to follow-up one of the best games ever. Bioshock level designer Jordan Thomas sat in the creative director's chair for the sequel, a major promotion that proved challenging both artistically and mentally for the rookie leader. We discuss the original premise of the Big Sister, the game's more action-oriented approach, as well as how its acclaimed Minerva's Den expansion led to the founding of indie studio Fullbright.\nJoin hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), and Game Informer Video Editor Alex Stadnik (@Studnik76) as we unpack the history and narrative of Bioshock's sophomore outing!\nIf you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.
