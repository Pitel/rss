It’s addictive and engrossing, and nowadays there are many different versions of Alexey Pajitnov’s game on various different platforms. Tetris, a video game about falling blocks that was developed in the Soviet Union, was and still is a video game revolution.\nTetris the movie, directed by Jon S. Baird (Stan & Ollie, Filth) is trying to replicate that satisfaction, that crowd-pleasing appeal that Tetris the video game has. But it has a much taller task than simply letting blocks fall. The film has to tell the story of how Tetris left the borders of the USSR, with political tensions reaching a boiling point in the background, and legalities, contracts, and technology twisting into a complicated web, all while addressing two different audiences – fans who know the story, and casual moviegoers (or Apple TV subscribers) who don’t.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

If, like myself, you enjoyed Jedi: Fallen Order, this will probably be a solid follow-up for you.

I shall draw a veil of discretion over the names of the actual games, but his chief complaint was that none of them had, actually, very robust design or tutorialising fit for purpose (i.e. teaching you how to play the game), especially for people who aren't able to give games their singular attention for hours at at time. I agree with him, although his attention is divided by, e.g., having a child in need of stimulation, and mine is divided by, e.g., being a child in need of stimulation.\nIt's probably turning my brain into cottage cheese, but I often do things at the same time as playing a game, like listening to music or a podcast. I understand that podcast games are sort of a genre now, but I've started doing it with regular games. Is this a me problem? Sure. Does it mean I want games to bring back that thing where NPC quest givers will just explain the quest again to you if you ask? 100% also yes.\nRead more",

Let’s get into some good words, shall we?\nWired’s Megan Farokhmanesh interviewed Richard Hofmeier, the developer of Cart Life - a sobering game about three street vendors trying to make ends meet. Hofmeier tells the story of his decision to remove the game from Steam ten years ago and his reasons for bringing it back.\nHis time away from game spaces made him appreciate the spectrum of expertise his colleagues had in things he’d never done. It was humbling. “So many people have talent and passion that gets entirely overlooked,” he says. He loved working in games, but back when he released Cart Life he feared a career in the field could get too insular. “The most interesting art, to me, comes from outsiders,” he says. “I was a little bit scared of becoming an insider myself.”\n Read more",

I can still remember sitting at the family PC in our living room, begging my parents for more internet time because I wanted chat to my friend on MSN Messenger. We had to buy hours of internet in those days, and between my young teenage self and my three brothers, we absolutely devoured those meagre weekly limits, always pleading for more, more, more as we became absolutely captivated by this new world of the online. \nLuckily, Emmett doesn't have to contend with such antiquated restraints in Videoverse, as his portal to the internet is built right into his enormous Nintendo DS-like home console, the Kinmoku Shark. As well as using it to play games reminiscent of old 16-bit classics, there's also a Nintendo Miiverse-esque social network on the Shark that Emmett uses to chat to his friends, post fan art of his favourite game, Feudal Fantasy, and feel part of something bigger. What hasn't changed since those early internet days, however (or indeed, the internet today) are the types of people he interacts with - there are trolls, of course, but there are also plenty of nice people here to support him, and the emergence of seemingly new user (and budding fan artist) Vivi quickly becomes the main subject of Videoverse's current free demo that's available as part of Steam's Storyteller Festival.\nRead more",

          "description": "With the solemnity of Samwise Gamgee informing Mr Frodo that one more step will take him the furthest he's ever been from home, I recently realised that it'll soon be the longest we've gone without a new Life Is Strange game since the franchise debuted in 2015. I looked into it and sure enough, the current record-holder is the gap between the season one finale of Life Is Strange and the first episode of its prequel Before The Storm: 1 year, 10 months, and 12 days. That means that come mid-August of this year — specifically, the 14th, which marks the 683rd day since True Colors' Wavelengths DLC released — LIS fans will be leaving the Shire whether we like it or not.\nI suspect that Life Is Strange: Steph's Story — the first prose novel tie-in to the franchise, released on March 21st — was commissioned with fans like me in mind. Fans who work out useless trivia like the above because they need something to occupy them when there's no new game on the horizon and they've played all the existing ones to death. Fans who know every character's canonical middle name and birthday. Fans who complain that it feels like they never have time to read any more, but nevertheless finished the novel and wrote a silly supporter post about it within ten days of publication. Of course I really liked Life Is Strange: Steph's Story. But will you, as a person whose relationship with this franchise is statistically guaranteed to be more normal than mine?\nRead more",

This time, though, you’ll be following three protagonists in their interweaving day-to-day lives. \r\n\n\r\nWindy Meadow’s press release teases the stories of Vena, Fabel, and Iudicia: “Will talented huntress Vena depart the harmonious but harmless village and leave her family behind in pursuit of riches with a merchant guild? Can Fabel finally embrace his talents, ditching the figurative shackles of his difficult past as he chases his dream of becoming a famous bard? And will outsider and herbalist Iudicia take hold of her love life, choosing not to marry a man she doesn’t really love at the risk of leading a lonely future?”\r\n \nRead more",

Last year we highlighted the show's thriving pin collecting scene, for instance, interviewing a bunch of Pinny Arcade enthusiasts about the hobby and discovering that physical badges are just a minor part of the appeal.\r\n\n\r\nEncouraged by the lovely warm feeling making that video left in my belly, we set out to shine a light on other lesser-known parts of PAX East during our time at this year's show. This led us to discover the PAX East Facebook group, a community of over 8,000 members brought together through their shared love of video games, pop culture and PAX itself. The page is dominated by a striking banner image, a photograph that shows a large group of people crowded around the PAX logo that's a permanent fixture in the main hall of the Boston convention centre.\r\n\n\r\n Rachel and I found this photograph fascinating. Who were these people? Do they take this picture every single year? How did something like this start, and who was responsible for organising it in the first place?\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Wildfrost is excellent at creating moments of triumph. Early on in my playthrough while I was still getting to grips with the game, I came face-to-face with a boss who got stronger when hit. Its card art had become bigger, juicier, more tauntingly malevolent, and easily could have taken out any of my team with a single hit. Thankfully, three of my team members were due to act one turn before it. The first chipped away a little of its health (its job was mostly healing) but the next doubled a stacked debuff that I had set up and turned the goliath into a giant bomb, and the effect of my two cards combined was just enough to trigger it. BOOM! My backline leader didn't even need to lift a single finger.\nPlaying with turn order and setting up synergies is a key part of how Wildfrost plays as a roguelike deck builder. Each individual card on the stage is part of a counter system, with both delaying and advancing them on the playing field being strategic choices. Some actions are free, like moving your cards around the stage or withdrawing them for healing, but playing cards out of your hand or shuffling your deck will pass the turn.\nRead more",

          "description": "A short animated sequence kicks The Last Worker into gear, reeling off the game’s backstory with breezy efficiency. It’s an apt start for this first-person satire set in a fully-automated dystopia, in that it underlines a very human aptitude for artistic communication. It’s surprising, then, that as The Last Worker continues its story, it takes less graceful turns, electing for verbosity over economy. For a game that takes critical aim at the future of work, frankly, it’s all a bit laboured.\nSo what does happen in that opening animation? First, we see everyman hero Kurt among thousands of recruits arriving at the gigantic distribution centre of megacorp Jüngle (like Amazon, get it?), to spend their working lives plucking products off shelves to order. Before long, though, any drop in output sees the employees themselves plucked off and given the boot, to be replaced by robots. As the numbers dwindle, top-performer Kurt remains steadfast, and even finds love among the boxes with a fellow product picker. But when she gets pregnant and quits, he stays behind, living full-time in the warehouse. Years pass. Jüngle smothers the entire retail market, and Kurt becomes, well, the last worker.\nRead more",

There was also lots of friendly hooting emanating from them as well, as mates and strangers attempted to co-ordinate their gaggles of limbs to steer various game characters in the right direction. \nIt was excellent fun, and I sampled a bunch of games that used toasters, intricate pulley systems, papier-mache tree stumps, bike wheels and more in place of your typical controllers and mice and keyboard. There were also plenty more I didn't get to try out, mainly due to time, and you can see the full list over on GDC's website.

It’s a reminder of just how early Westwood happened upon the blueprint for real-time strategy, right as many PC users were buying their first trackball mice.\r\n\nBack then, the developer was fresh from Dune II, its unlikely David Lynch adaptation and progenitor of the RTS genre as we know it today. Inspired by the house politics and struggle for resources that consumed the desert planet Arrakis, Westwood had come up with an addictive formula for harvesting spice and converting that wealth into military power, which in turn could be used in the battle to secure more spice. The team was, quite frankly, surprised by how much fun that formula had turned out to be.\nRead more",

It is, like its developer's previous game Kerbal Space Program, about building a machine designed to fly, crashing it back to earth, then constructing something better. \r\n\nNow its developer has announced they're doing something similar with the game itself. Balsa Model Flight Sim will relaunch later this year with a new name, Kitbash Model Club, a more ambitious physics construction sandbox, and a plan to release as a complete game rather than into early access. Existing owners of Balsa Model Flight Simulator will get Kitbash Model Club for free.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "As is so often the case in systemic turn-based tactics games, things started to go wrong in my preview session for The Lamplighters League when a nearby torch met a cunningly placed oil slick and erupted into flames. A load of enemies were instantly enveloped in its hot sea of death, as intended, but one of our heroes - the tank-like bruiser Fedir - also ended up getting burned by mistake. As an ex-mob enforcer, he's certainly built to take a few punches, and his abilities are all focused on making him the centre of attention, his attacks growing more powerful as his rage levels continue to grow. \"You want him to get attacked,\" game director Chris Rogers tells me, calling on the phrase 'you wouldn't like him when he's angry' as the basis for Fedir's ability set. But with that extra fire damage he receives, it's just a little too much all at once. He gets knocked down, and the tide of battle quickly goes south.\nIn truth, I played no part in this downfall. Rogers was in the control cockpit for this one, showing me exactly how Harebrained Schemes' latest game actually works. It's quite a different proposition from their last game, Battletech, and in this quite literal trial by fire, studio head and co-founder Mitch Gitelman actually pulled a dollar out of his pocket at one point and put a bet on whether Rogers would make it out alive. He certainly had his work cut out for him. Rogers won that dollar, and here's how the game's emphasis on deep, customisable character builds set him up for success.\nRead more",

Even nuzzled into my chair with a controller in hand, I simply can’t stick to the beat. My eyes glued to notes floating across the screen, trying to hit them at just the right time, you’d probably see Time hiding in a corner to my left, giggling at my repeated failure.

You have to know enough about enough to be able to write about enough.\nThere are, however, a bunch of big important games that I haven't played. Sometimes it's because a bunch of other people have, so that gap in the site's knowledge is already plugged (and I do always make sure to be aware of their impact and basic facts). Other times, they might be games that I'm not really interested in playing, either because they're not my genre or they seem too overwrought. Or, in some cases, it's because everyone says they're really good and I have to try them, though I've been burned before on this method (you people said the same about Ready Player One).

But he wasn't quite sure what. \"I was in the kitchen talking to my son about, 'Oh, what should I do? I don't know what opportunities there are,' and he was like, 'Why don't you just pick the company you want to work at and ask them?'\" And as a life-long Crusader Kings player, the answer was clear. \"Okay!?\" Humble says incredulously. \"I can do that, I guess. So I did. I wrote to [PR manager] Troy [Goodfellow], and he knew Fred [Wester, CEO], and that was it. It was two weeks later and I met him in San Francisco and said, hey, I'd like to start a studio, and here's the way I'd like to run it. And he was like, sure, let's go for it.\"\nSo began Humble's journey to creating Life By You, his upcoming life simulator that's set to give his former pet project, The Sims, a run for its money. With The Sims 5, or Project Rene as it's currently known, still some way off, Life By You seems poised to finally give life sim fans the game they've always wanted. \"I wanted to make an open world life simulator where the core tenant was freedom,\" says Humble. \"Where players could freely play and tell their stories with minimal friction.\" And what was standing in the way of that freedom? Loading screens, says Humble.\nRead more",

It's a purely military game about overcoming massed defences through attrition, both in localised real-time battles, and a turn-based strategic map.

          "description": "Show me a game about a feral, furry creature with a never ending hunger for junk food and I'm immediately interested. I played Pizza Possum on the first day of PAX and knew it would make a great indie highlight for our time here at PAX East. Liam and I have now both played the demo and you can listen to our impressions in the video below:\nWhat really appealed to us about Pizza Possum is how chaotic it is. It's like Untitled Goose Game but at double the speed. Playing the eponymous possum, you need you scamper around a sunny Mediterranean town scoffing as much food as you can get your grubby mitts on.\nThere's an element of hide-and-seek too, as there are patrol dogs who will try and stop your food eating rampage, but you can quickly jump into a berry bush to thorw them off your scent. It's goofy fun, and we're completeley smitten with it.\n Read more",

Another interesting thing is that Mega Cat reached out to a handful of real-life wrestlers to ask their permission to use their likeness in the game - not an easy feat to secure, I'm sure.\n Read more",

It's a super fast parkour adventure in the vein of Neon White, and after ten minutes with the demo my heart race was through the roof. If I owned a fitbit it would have been screaming at me to have a nice sit down with a cuppa. Check out my full impressions in the video below:\nHell Of An Office puts your platforming reflexes to the test as you're tasked with sprinting ad jumping your way straight outta hell. With only a stapler as your means of survival, you need to navigate through each level before it slowly sinks into the burning lava. React quickly, or fall victim to Hell's scorching pools.\nIf you love the blood-pumping, sweaty palm inducing action-platforming of Neon White, make sure to keep an eye on Hell Of An Office as it makes it's way through Early Access.\n Read more",

You can watch my impressions of the demo in the video below:\nIn Mythwrecked you play as Alex, a backpacker who has washed up on the sun-drenched shores of Ambrosia Island. As she begins exploring, she soon realises that this island seems to be a hot spot for the gods from ancient Greek myths. Your task is to befriend each god, help them restore their memories, and find a way back to civilisation.\nFrom playing the demo, you can see much of what made Roki fun reflected in Mythwrecked. The environments are interesting to poke around in, puzzles are breezy brain ticklers, and it has Polygon Treehouse's sense of humour. Each Greek god has a humerous twist on their lore,  and during the demo I had a fun time chatting with Hermes, who is dressed in nothing more than a pair of skimpy white speedos and a matching white sweat band - a bold choice of attire.\n Read more",

          "description": "Po dlouhé době byli strahovští Bastlíři na výjezdu - tentokrát na konferenci Hackaday v Berlíně. Rádi vám proto ukážou fotky, popovídají o zhlédnutých prezentacích a poreferují o berlínském hackerspace MotionLab. Ukážou vám také \"Badge\" - visačku, kterou dostali všichni návštěvníci akce a která obsahuje virtuální 4bitový procesor. Neuvěříte, kolik zábavy můžete zažít s instrukční sadou, která má délku instrukce slabých 12 bitů.\r\n\r\nAle nebojte - celá Virtuální Bastlírna rozhodně nebude jen o zážitcích z berlínského výletu. Jako pokaždé, budete jádrem diskuze Vy - účastníci! Pokud by ale nastalo ticho, Bastlíři z MacGyvera si nachystali dost novinek ze světa techniky. Jako obvykle se objevily nové procesory - ať už procesory fungující od 0.8 V z baterie nebo velmi levné ARMy od 40 centů (které ale nejsou výjimečně z Číny). Pak nový ST-LINK s velice šikovnou funkci pro embedded programátory. A Raspberry Pi Pico W bude mít konečně použitelný Bluetooth.\r\n\r\nSamozřejmě jako vždy mají Bastlíři i plný pytel drobností a úsměvných zpráviček. Kupříkladu se dozvíte, jak se dá podívat neinvazivně do některých integrovaných obvodů, co je nového na Průša i3 MK4, jak prakticky uchovávat SMD součástky, jak se v Brně staví vesmírná loď nebo co je zač studentský vesmírný projekt SBUDNIC.\r\n\r\nAť už vás zaujalo cokoliv z nabízených témat, chcete ukázat nějaký svůj bastl a nebo jste také byli na berlínské konferenci, dorazte! Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve středu 5. dubna od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

There is nothing left to do but rebuild. And it's in restoring nature, in unpacking the very idea of a city-builder, that Terra Nil finds a smart twist on a traditional foundation.\nIt's fun to think that the same team behind Broforce and Genital Jousting made Terra Nil. It's not that I don't think a studio that's made games about bros and dicks can't also make a game about ecological restoration. But Terra Nil sees Free Live exploring an incredibly serene approach to puzzles and city-building.

          "description": "Robbie is done with your Funko Pop shit\nMerch-maker Numskull has announced the next statue in the company's Silent Hill range — And second in the lineup of nightmarish creatures and dream warriors comes a particular fan favorite, in the form of Silent Hill 3 protagonist Heather Mason.\nThe tortured and traumatized young hero — forced to step up and face her fears and her own destiny when trouble comes a'callin — is the latest release in Numskull's burgeoning range based on the skin-crawling Konami franchise. The PVC statue, which stands around 10 inches tall, depicts Ms. Mason in her classic casual clothing, packing heat and dramatically wiping a cut on her delicate face. Heather's base features a visual motif stylized after the Happy-go-Doomy locale of Lakeside Amusement Park, and is complete with an appearance by its creepy mascot, Robbie the Rabbit.\n \nHeather will make for a wonderful companion to Numskull's previously released Bubble Head Nurse statue, as dedicated Silent Hill fans slowly turn their lounge mantle into a menagerie of nightmares. What's next in the range? Who knows? But I'm sure hoping for a life-size, crazy-eyed Eileen head to block up my kitchen doorway. Wouldn't that be a fun conversation piece?\nWhatever we get, Numskull's Silent Hill range is an attractive and (relatively) affordable way to pay tribute to one of horror gaming's most iconic franchises. For interested parties, the Silent Hill 3 Heather Mason statue is available to pre-order now over on the Numskull website, retailing for around £100 (or roughly $130 USD). The statue is expected to ship in September 2023.\nThe post Silent Hill 3’s Heather Mason is coming to gloom up your mantlepiece appeared first on Destructoid.",

A single-player campaign saw players battle throughout a range of stadiums set within the Pokeverse, while multiplayer action allowed up to four trainers to compete in head-to-head throwdown — all clamoring to be the very best, like no one ever was.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd8P2QJwbrM&ab_channel=NintendoUK\nAnd, when the dust has settled, then players can chill out with a series of fun and silly mini-games — such as Sushi-Go-Round and Magikarp's Splash — located in the oddly titled \"Kid's Club\". The Nintendo Switch Online version will feature all of the modes from the original release. Unfortunately, the implementation of the Game Boy releases is not a part of this version, though hopefully this can be rectified down the line.\nI've bored y'all with this story before, but I was working in games retail when Pokemon Stadium dropped, and there is no other title that I remember being so fervently sought after more. We had people offering to pay double if we could promise a copy, pre-orders that weren't being fulfilled for weeks, and a situation where we had to keep all stock off the showfloor as people would rabidly attempt to bargain us to sell people's reserves to them.\n\"Can you call me when it comes back in?\"\n\"No, we cannot.\"\nPokemon Stadium joins Nintendo Switch Online on April 12.\nThe post Pokemon Stadium coming to Nintendo Switch Online next week appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, his enthusiasm for Microsoft’s first foray into the console market has left me with a lasting affection towards the massive brick of hardware.\nWith just short of 1000 games, it had a larger library than Nintendo’s GameCube, but a much smaller one than the PS2.

          "description": "Still listed as \"leaving soon\"\nBack in 2016 Remedy and Microsoft teamed up for a live action TV show/game hybrid starring Shawn Ashmore called Quantum Break. It was a wild endeavor; and while it had plenty of flaws, even the most ardent detractors had to admit that it was unique. It's also uniquely leaving the Xbox Game Pass service soon, despite being published by Microsoft.\nAs a reminder, Quantum Break was indeed developed by Remedy Entertainment (the purveyors of Alan Wake, Control, and more), and published by Microsoft. For nearly seven years running it's been a console exclusive, only ever appearing on Xbox One and PC. It was also added to Xbox Game Pass in late 2018 (September 1), but it seems that was just temporary. If you look at the \"leaving soon\" section on your Xbox console, it's listed there alongside of a small selection of other titles.\n[caption id=\"attachment_372188\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Photo by Destructoid[/caption]\nWhy is Quantum Break leaving Xbox Game Pass?\nAs many have pointed out, Quantum Break seems like a licensing nightmare, even if kept within the \"family\" of Microsoft. There are multiple production studios involved in this, as well as direct likeness rights. Reminiscent of the time Forza Motorsport 7 left Xbox Game Pass (and general sale), nothing lasts forever.\nWe've also reached out to Microsoft for clarification on the issue, and to see if the act of removal is possibly a mistake. We'll update the article if we hear back.\nAlso \"leaving soon\" in April of 2023 for Xbox Game Pass:\nRift Breaker\nMoonglow Bay\nRainbow Six Extraction\nThe Dungeon Of Naheulbeuk: The Amulet Of Chaos\nLife is Strange: True Colors\nThe Long Dark\nThe post Microsoft-published Quantum Break is curiously leaving Xbox Game Pass appeared first on Destructoid.",

Featuring gorgeous rendered/rotoscoped pixel art, a roster of fantastic, beautifully animated characters, cool new stages, and a great soundtrack, the launch of KoF XIII felt incredibly special, especially given the chaotic, half-baked disappointment of its predecessor, KoF XII. Unfortunately, despite being held in high regard, lackluster online capabilities did little to help the already niche fighter hold its ground on the competitive scene.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCJjObBRrk4&ab_channel=SNKOFFICIAL\nBut SNK hopes that Global Match, complete with its revamped, modern-day netcode, will allow those fans pining for the latter days of the franchise's 2D venture to get back in the ring, taking on KoF (and other fighting game) fans worldwide. Perhaps we'll even see the great title make a quiet return on the professional circuit — though SNK will understandably be putting most of its chips in the KoF XV bucket. Regardless, this is fantastic news for long-term KoF fans, and I get my gal Leona and my boy Ash back in all their super-smooth, pixel-powered glory.\nThe King of Fighters XIII: Global Match is in development for PlayStation and Nintendo Switch.

The new offices, located in the Osaka Umeda Twin Towers south building, will support the developer in its efforts both grow and endure over the coming decades.\n\"Konami Osaka Studio is a developmental relocation of the existing studio and comes with the concept of 'Creators First'\", said the developer in a press release. \"It is characterized by a well-developed environment where creators can demonstrate their full potential, and is set up in a location with convenient transportation access. As the major production center in Western Japan, the facility is fully equipped with motion capture equipments and sound studios necessary for product development.\"\nKonami, which celebrates its 50th anniversary this week, goes on to suggest that the new building will be a core entity in the studio's current and future projects, noting that it hopes Konami Osaka will encourage \"sustainable growth\" over the next 50 years. So I guess Konami is not looking to get out of the gaming biz anytime soon — despite the past decade's penchant for gyms and pachinko halls.\nIn addition to the new offices, Konami continues its work on the establishment of a new, next-gen R&D center. Konami Creative Front Tokyo Bay is expected to open in 2025, and provide the central locale for the company's experiments into new engines and technology. Having already teased several unannounced game reveals for 2023, Konami's next major release is expected to be a remake of the legendary survival horror title Silent Hill 2, which is in development for PS5 and PC.\nThe post Konami opens new studio in Osaka, Japan appeared first on Destructoid.",

He is, in essence, the \"father\" of the Orochi-powered team of Chris, Shermie, and Yashiro, all of whom are already present in KoF XV.\nYou can check out a sneak peek at Goenitz in the video below, timed to 2:45.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ed65K9MnidQ&t=153s&ab_channel=SNKOFFICIAL\nThe coming of Goenitz is one of a number of updates planned for the title's new season. This week has already seen the return of veteran character Kim Kaphwan, who is now available to purchase as part of KoF XV's expansive roster. In addition, we can expect to see the ABSOLUTE MENACE Sylvie Paula Paula make her return in just a few months' time, as well as the initial tests for cross-platform capabilities. We can expect three further characters to arrive in 2023, alongside new balance adjustments. All in, KoF XV is getting the best post-release support offered to an SNK release in many moons.\nThe King of Fighters XV is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox Series X.\nThe post King of Fighters ’96 dickhead Goenitz coming to KoF XV as free DLC appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Survivalist sequel pushed back a full year\nStudio Wildcard has announced that its long-in-development sequel ARK II will no longer meet its tentative 2023 release date — the survival sandbox sequel is now expected to launch on Xbox and PC platforms in late-2024.\n\"We’ve put much thought into delaying ARK II for the betterment of the final product and the team’s well-being,\" reads a statement from the developer. \"This news will be disappointing to many—we feel it too — but we’re confident this heavy decision is the right one. Our goal is to make ARK II the best game it can be and provide a truly exceptional and rewarding experience for players.\"\n\"We sincerely apologize for this delay and genuinely appreciate your understanding. Your support and passion are vital to us, and we will continue to work intensively to deliver the ultimate next-gen dinosaur survival experience. With that in mind, we do not plan to showcase any gameplay/screenshots/videos of ARK II this year; however, we intend to keep you informed and engaged in the development process by regularly showcasing more ARK II assets in the months ahead.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8KbXpk2J9Y&ab_channel=ARK%3ASurvivalEvolved\nARK II, the sequel to 2017 release Ark: Survival Evolved, was first announced back in 2020, and has been in deep development since. A trailer was released during the June 2022 Xbox Showcase, but the title has remained relatively quiet since then. It is quite believable that, given the incredible scope of Studio Wildcard's project, the building of the sequel is a grueling and complex venture — especially given the young nature of its powerful Unreal 5 technology. For now, budding dino riders will simply have to continue to play the waiting game, for another 16 months at the very least.\nYou can check out the full version of the studio's lenthy statement on the official website.\nARK II is currently in development for PC and Xbox Series X.\nThe post ARK II has been delayed to late 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Monarch of the Quarter-hole\nSuper Villain Games has dropped a trailer outlining their upcoming game, King of the Arcade, which is set to drop on April 12, 2023. Right now, the game is set to release exclusively on Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S, which is something I didn’t even know happens.\nKing of the Arcade seems to be about saving a local arcade with prime joystick handling. You play as Mac McCormick, a former arcade champion. Although he’s no longer in his prime, he jumps to action to save an arcade from an evil landlord — by playing video games, I guess! I thought this might be, like, win the prize purse and use the money to pay the rent, but apparently, the landlord has “seven members of his arcade gang,” which makes less sense while also being a lot cooler.\nhttps://youtu.be/oI0Wimz5sCU\nThere are 40 games within various genres throughout King of the Arcade, which makes it a sort of compilation of fictional titles not unlike Arcade Paradise. What is less clear is how these are all tied together. It obviously has some narrative focus, but is it a linear progression of games? Do you play them between visual novel dialogue portions? The press release says the arcade is “open-world” but not much else.\nKing of the Arcade is the second game from Super Villain Games after Doug Hates His Job. Reaction to Doug Hates His Job doesn’t seem to be the most positive, but I like what I see with King of the Arcade. Most of the feedback toward the previous game seemed to focus on a lack of polish, so hopefully that won’t be the case here.\nUnfortunately, it may be a while before I, personally, find out, since I don’t own an Xbox One or Xbox series X|S, but if you do, then you’ll be able to grab King of the Arcade on April 12.\nThe post King of the Arcade brings us back to the ’80s on Xbox April 12 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Drifting over to Europe\nFor a while, Nintendo kind of took a silent approach to the \"Joy-Con drift\" Switch hardware issues. Eventually, the number of impacted consumers hit critical mass and they had to respond: by offering free repairs. Although Europe and the UK have done this on a case-by-case basis (and not necessarily out of warranty): that's changing now with a grander, more sweeping statement on the Nintendo EU support pages. In other words, the UK and Europe are getting a little deal-sweetener as of this month.\nHere's the full statement from Nintendo of Europe about the situation:\n\"Nintendo takes great pride in creating high-quality and durable products and is continuously making improvements to them. Therefore and until further notice, Nintendo offers to consumers who purchased the respective product in the EEA, UK and Switzerland that repairs for responsiveness syndrome relating to control sticks will be conducted at no charge by official Nintendo repair centres.\"\n\nNintendo even calls this \"responsiveness syndrome\" or \"so-called drifting\" (ha!) on their official site. Here's how you can actually get it fixed if you live in the aforementioned areas.\nA link to book a repair for Joy-Con in Europe or the UK\nYou can find the full breakdown on this page here. Nintendo also has a full customer support page to book a Joy-Con repair here. I've actually had two pairs of Joy-Con repaired in the US, and it was a painless process. Hopefully this policy is here to stay and everyone can get their controllers fixed going forward.\n[Thanks John!]\nThe post Nintendo expands free Joy-Con repair system for UK and Europe appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The S-Tier Terror is Back\nBandai Namco, still on a seemingly unstoppable marketing drive, has released another new character trailer for its flashy-looking fighter Tekken 8 — This time around, we focus on the enviable style and undeniable power of one of the series' most recent addition: grandmaster Leroy Smith.\nHaving made his debut as a Tekken 7 DLC character, Smith is still a relative newcomer to the Tekken franchise. Turning heads immediately with his slick style and cool-as-a-cucumber attitude, Leroy would make his presence felt in double-quick time, becoming one of the most dangerous characters on the roster and a frequent winner on the game's competitive circuit. Leroy has developed a mastery of the high-speed kung-fu form, Wing Chun, which allows him to move with quiet grace and precision, before suddenly unleashing rapid, lightning-like blows on his opponent's noodle.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvL5Rh6M4lM&ab_channel=BandaiNamcoEntertainmentAmerica\nAs a child, Leroy grew up mired in the violence of 1980s New York, where gang warfare, complete with integration by crooked cops and politicians would see the young fighter lose his entire family. Brutally injured, and guided by little else but fate, Leroy traveled the world, searching for enlightenment and inner peace while honing his bewildering fighting abilities. Decades later, Leroy returned to America, aiming to stamp out all forms of injustice and corruption wherever it may lay — a path that ultimately leads him to the doors of the Mishima Zaibatsu.\nTekken 8 is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X. It is tentatively expected to launch late in 2023 or early 2024. Be sure to check out the previous trailers for  Jin Kazama, Marshall Law, Nina Williams, King, Paul Phoenix, Jack-8, Lars Alexandersson, Kazuya Mishima, Jun Kazama, Ling Xiayou, and Asuka Kazama.\nThe post The ‘Grandmaster of Drip’ Leroy Smith returns in Tekken 8 appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's a 5-Star raid, which isn't too impressive, and it has five max IVs (if you need a Ditto with specific IVs, go for it!). But hey, it's content in the eyes of Game Freak and The Pokemon Company.\nIf you don't have a Ditto yet (he can be hard to find in the early game), this event will probably be up your alley! If you do have one though, there's not much of a reason to pop in for a 5-Star raid.\nThat said, there is another known 7-Star Tera Raid on the way, as Samurott returns to the pair of games from April 7 through April 9. That means you can hatch an Oshawott and grab all sorts of 7-Star raid goodies during that period. Oh, and the DLC is coming too!

It is similar, in a fashion, to titles like Atari's Centipede, although it offers more in the way of return fire, as well as movement across three sides of the game screen.\nCheck out the exceptionally old-school action below, courtesy of Old Classic Retro Gaming.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aa_k2xFH69g&ab_channel=OldClassicRetroGaming\nBeautifully, the title attempts to sell the title as an adaptation of sorts to J. Lee Thompson's legendary 1961 movie The Guns of Navarone, itself an adaptation of Alistair MacLean's 1957 novel. One can only assume that this was not, however, an officially licensed Columbia Pictures product, which may go some way to explaining why Navarone would not receive a release outside of Japan. Besides, once Pac-Man Fever gripped the planet, the lo-fi thrills of Navarone would quickly fade into the background.\nNavarone is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nThe post Namco’s 1980 shooter Navarone joins the Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

You are Nini, a \"newly earthbound\" teen. And it's one month until the world ends. You and your friends must loop through the eighth month of the year until you either overcome the Kegai, an otherworldly threat, or humanity becomes doomed.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AlJr-Ytq1Y\nIt's a really high-concept set-up for the story that, in all honesty, I'm still not 100% clear on.

          "description": "Remarkably unremarkable\nI find scrolling shoot-’em-ups to be one of the most difficult genres to talk about, right up there with puzzle games. It’s a formula that has been utilized many times, and frequently the changes are very small. Most of the time, you maneuver your spaceship, unicorn, or spaceship with boxing gloves around on an automatically scrolling background until a much larger boss shows up.\nI can’t say that Axelay is much different. The formula could be described as a close companion to Life Force or Abadox where it alternates between vertical and horizontal scrolling stages. Its weapon system is a little lackluster. Axelay is, by most metrics, a pretty flacid shoot-’em-up.\nExcept, it’s still worth experiencing if you have eyes and ears.\n[caption id=\"attachment_371902\" align=\"…",

Focusing on quick speed and chunky polygonal graphics, it tries to recapture the yesteryear of arcade racing. Despite its retro focus, the developers have tried to put in some more realistic features into it, including how the suspension works and the track design.\nhttps://youtu.be/_Jz4K2Q_fMM\nIt’s also the sequel to 2020’s Formula Retro Racing. It uses the same art style while trying to expand the game in every way, offering more tracks, polish, and even a VR mode. The developers have said they plan on expanding and improving the game over at least the next three months.\nI played a bit of Formula Retro Racing: World Tour, and it’s maybe not for me. I like retro racers, but I normally think back to San Francisco Rush. It leans a little more into simulation design than I prefer. I’d rather have dinosaurs and UFOs on the track, or failing that, let me drive a school bus. That said, it does feel like a relatively tight experience, and there’s a lot more content here than there was in the original 2020 title.\nFormula Retro Racing: World Tour is available now on PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S for $19.99.\nThe post Formula Retro Racing: World Tour parallel parks on PC, Switch, and Xbox today appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's a casual fallback, and sometimes you hear about something you've missed. Yet there was one phrase, around one game, that really dominated this year: \"Have you seen Slay the Princess yet?\"\nI went into the show already familiar with Black Tabby Games' unique adventure game, as its trailer caught my eye a while back and its demo impressed in a recent Steam Next Fest. The premise is simple: you're on a path, to a cabin in the woods, and inside there's a princess. The Narrator, guiding your way, asserts that you must slay the princess.

However, PGA Tour 2K23 defies expectations by announcing that 16-time World Champion and Hollywood star John Cena is joining the roster as a playable golfer.\nOn April 7, the invisible leader of the Cenation joins the game’s roster of celebrity athletes alongside Michael Jordan and Steph Curry. Given his well-documented freakish strength, Cena excels at hitting long drives and rocks a vaguely familiar red, white, and blue ensemble. Cena is set to compete at Wrestlemania 39 this weekend, challenging Austin Theory for the United States Championship. If he comes up short on Saturday, he can always bounce back and win the Masters instead. Or continue improving his K/D ratio in Fortnite. Cena is nothing if not versatile. \nPGA Tour 2K23 is available now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Xbox players can try the game for free on the weekend of April 6-9, while Steam players can play until April 10.",

If that wasn't exciting enough, we now know that the cast from the cult classic 2010 film is reprising their roles.\nAs reported by Deadline, the still-untitled Scott Pilgrim show will be computer animated by Japanese animation studio Science SARU (Devilman Crybaby, The Heike Story, Inu-Oh). Scott Pilgrim vs. The World director Edgar Wright returns as executive director, with Scott Pilgrim author Bryan Lee O’Malley and artist Bendavid Grabinski will serve as executive producers, writers, and showrunners. The plot of the graphic novels/movie centers on slacker musician Scott Pilgrim battling the seven evil exes of his new girlfriend, Ramona Flowers. \n\n\nThe primary actors from the live-action film are higlighted in the trailer above, which include:\nMichael Cera - Scott Pilgrim\nMary Elizabeth Winstead - Ramona Flowers\nKieran Culkin - Wallace Wells\nSatya Bhabha - Matthew Patel\nChris Evans - Lucas Lee\nAnna Kendrick - Stacey Pilgrim\nBrie Larson - Envy Adams\nAlison Pill - Kim Pine\nAubrey Plaza - Julie Powers\nBrandon Routh - Todd Ingram\nJason Schwartzman - Gideon Graves\nJohnny Simmons - Young Neil\nMark Webber - Stephen Stills\nMae Whitman - Roxie Richter\nEllen Wong - Knives Chau\nUnfortunatley, the series currently still doesn’t have a release window other than “coming soon.” Scott Pilgrim has always had a strong relationship with video games; the graphic novels and film incorporate a bevy of gaming references. Of course, we’d be remiss, not to mention the much-beloved 2010 beat ‘em up Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game, which was remastered for modern consoles in 2021. \nAre you excited to see Scott Pilgrim return as an anime?

Live A Live was originally released in 1994 for the Super Famicom in Japan, but it hadn’t been localized for the West for decades. Directed by Takashi Tokita, one of the lead creative minds behind Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy IV, the game consists of eight very different short stories, each starring its own protagonist and featuring distinct gameplay mechanics and presentations. While the battle system is turn-based strategy, sometimes the game flips that on its head in unique ways.\nLast year, Square Enix resurrected the title by giving it an Octopath Traveler-style HD-2D facelift, a rearranged soundtrack, and full voice-acting. You can pre-order the game on PlayStation and Steam to get a 20% discount. To learn more, you can read our review of Live A Live here.",

Square Enix has announced a new story expansion called In Tanta We Trust, and it takes place decades before the campaign begins.\nThe story sees Frey Holland follow a mysterious voice that leads to her being sent back in time 25 years before she first stepped foot in Athia. She arrives at the Purge of Rheddig, the battle that caused Athia’s collapse and pushed the Tantas to madness. Frey must now fight to save this era of Athia, and she has backup in the form of Tanta Cinta. Frey gains new magical powers, including tag-team-focused abilities that utilize Tanta Cinta’s talents. The DLC also features new environments for players to scale using Frey’s parkour skills. \nForspoken: In Tanta We Trust is a paid expansion that launches on May 26. Those who purchased the Digital Deluxe Edition of the game can play it three days early, on May 23. For more on Forspoken, you can read our review here.

In a statement to Video Games Chronicle, the publisher reveals that it will instead hold its own live presentation on June 12 in Los Angeles. \nThe publisher statement to VGC reads “While we initially intended to have an official E3 presence, we’ve made the subsequent decision to move in a different direction, and will be holding a Ubisoft Forward Live event on 12th June in Los Angeles. We look forward to sharing more details with our players very soon.”\nUbisoft CEO Yves Guillemot stated in February that the company would commit to attending “if E3 happens”. If that's the case, this news certainly doesn’t bode well for the fate of what’s supposed to be E3’s big return. \nAs for what Ubisoft could show at its event, Assassin’s Creed Mirage, The Crew Motorfest, and (maybe) Skull and Bones are slated to release this year. Other announced projects include the long-quiet Splinter Cell and Prince of Persia remakes, a multitude of new Assassin’s Creed games, and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. A rumored follow-up to Immortals Fenyx Rising could also make an appearance.  \nUbisoft joins Nintendo on the list of major publishers that have declined to participate in this year’s show, following a previous report that Microsoft and Sony plan to follow suit. E3 is largely organized by ReedPop this year and will take place June 13-16 at the Los Angeles Convention Center. The event will open its doors to fans and press, with separate attendance days for each.

Nintendo has announced that tomorrow at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET, they'll be releasing the first proper gameplay showcase of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. The presentation will be hosted by Zelda series producer Eiji Aonuma, and will last \"roughly 10 minutes.\" Here's the announcement tweet:\nJoin The Legend of #Zelda series producer, Eiji Aonuma, for roughly 10 minutes of gameplay from The Legend of Zelda: #TearsOfTheKingdom on 3/28 at 7:00 a.m. PT on our YouTube channel.\nhttps://t.co/uMUCfVjFQL pic.twitter.com/y49N4jRUTz\nMarch 27, 2023\nTo watch the video when it premieres tomorrow on YouTube, just click the Link below:\nDespite the fact that we've gotten multiple trailers over the past few months, Nintendo has yet to reveal any clip of gameplay longer than a few seconds, and every new glimpse seems to raise more questions than it answers. What are those strange vehicles? Does Link have a new paraglider? And why does the game cost $70? Whether or not tomorrow's showcase addresses those questions, we'll all find out when Tears of the Kingdom releases on May 12.\nWe'll be live streaming our reactions to the 10 minutes showcase on Game Informer's Twitch channel.",

To know that a game heavily inspired by Chrono Trigger will feature music from the man behind its score is exciting. Still, it is worth being excited for the soundtrack that Mitsuda will not be directly involved with, as well.\nThe majority of Sea of Stars’ soundtrack is in the hands of the talented Eric W. Brown, who also composed the soundtrack for The Messenger. Brown’s musical history started with playing drums in metal bands. “I've been a drummer since I was a kid and I'm still a drummer now, but, you know, I got into music production via chiptune essentially,” Brown says.  Around 2006 he decided to focus on making music on his own in the chiptune genre, primarily on Game…",

          "description": "A video game based on the hit Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles graphic novel The Last Ronin is in the works, Polygon reports.\nThe news comes from Polygon's interview with Doug Rosen, senior vice president for games and emerging media at Paramount Global. According to Rosen, The Last Ronin video game will be a single-player action role-playing title in the vein of the Norse-themed God of War series. Like the story it adapts, the game will feature a mature tone. The game’s developer has not been named, and the project is years away from release. \nThe Last Ronin was published in 2020 as a five-issue mini-series by IDW. It takes place in a dark futuristic New York, where three of the four turtles have been killed. The surviving turtle, whose identity is revealed at the end of the first issue (we won’t spoil it), dons a black mask and seeks revenge by fighting crime using both his and the weapons of his fallen brothers. \nIt’s a cool (and very grim) story if you haven’t read it, and we’re excited to see it translated into a game. Rosen also mentions in the same interview that Paramount sees opportunities to create different types of TMNT games that target young and adult audiences. \nThe Turtles are enjoying quite the renaissance lately thanks to the launch of the well-received beat ‘em up Shredder’s Revenge last year, the nostalgia trip of the Cowabunga Collection, a Shredder-themed Call of Duty pack, and even a new animated film coming to theaters this August.  \n[Source: Polygon]",

Despite some shortcomings, the compilation remains the best official way to experience those classic games from Genesis and Sega CD three decades following their original releases. Today, Sega announced the bundle is about to get better through Sonic Origins Plus, a premium upgrade that arrives a year after the collection's initial launch.\nSonic Origins Plus brings forward all the features of Sonic Origins delivered last year – Classic Mode, Anniversary Mode, widescreen support, added story animations, a virtual museum, and more – while adding a bunch of new content. First up, Sonic Origins Plus adds all 12 Sonic Game Gear games to the museum.\nThe full list of Game Gear games getting added is listed below.\nDr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine\nSonic Blast\nSonic Chaos\nSonic Drift\nSonic Drift 2\nSonic Labyrinth\nSonic Spinball\nSonic the Hedgehog\nSonic the Hedgehog 2\nSonic the Hedgehog Triple Trouble\nTails Adventure\nTails' Sky Patrol\nOn top of that, Amy joins the roster of playable characters in the Genesis and Sega CD titles (Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD). One of the strangest exclusions in the original Sonic Origins release is also rectified, as Knuckles will become playable in Sonic CD. Sadly, this first press release does not make any mention of restoring the replaced music in Sonic the Hedgehog 3.\n\n\nSonic Origins Plus arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on June 23. If you don't already own the initial release of Sonic Origins, the digital version of Sonic Origins Plus costs $40. The physical version, which includes a 20-page artbook and reversible coversheet with new art, also costs $40. If you already own Sonic Origins, you can upgrade to Plus for $10.

          "description": "Arkane was developing a PlayStation 5 version of its upcoming first-person vampire shooter, Redfall, before Microsoft acquired Bethesda in 2020. However, following the acquisition, the PS5 version of the game was canceled by Microsoft, according to Arkane director Harvey Smith in an interview with IGN France (translated by IGN). \nDiscussing this with IGN France, Smith said, \"We got bought by Microsoft and that was a huge sea change. They said, 'No PlayStation 5. Now we're gonna do Game Pass, Xbox and PC.'\"\n\n\nSmith said Arkane didn't mind the decision, even if Redfall was originally meant to release on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. \n\"Support from Game Pass and having to worry about one less platform, one less complexity,\" Smith told IGN France. \"And Game Pass has a ton of people that can play. It could be our biggest game ever because of the 30 million Game Pass [members] or whatever that number is.\" \nNews of this canceled PS5 version of Redfall doesn't come as much of a surprise. When Redfall was revealed during a 2021 Xbox and Bethesda E3 showcase, it was revealed as an Xbox console exclusive. And considering it's par for the course for companies like PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo to keep their first-party releases off of competitor consoles, it's also not surprising Microsoft opted to make Redfall an Xbox exclusive after it acquired Bethesda. \nA spokesperson for Microsoft responded to this story, providing the following statement: \nRedfall hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on May 2. \nFor more about the game, watch the latest Redfall story trailer that introduces some of the vampiric big bass and then watch this gameplay trailer that invites you out to a bloody night on the town. \n[Source: IGN France via IGN]\nAre you excited for Redfall?

This beta will feature Crash Bandicoot, Coco Bandicoot, Tawna Bandicoot, Doctor Neo Cortex, and Dingodile. \n\n\nThe game will cost $29.99 but a deluxe edition for $39.99 will also be available. Crash Team Rumble will also include a battle pass and both editions include the first season's pass. The deluxe edition will also include the Season 2 battle pass, a free 25-tier boost for Season 1, and the digital proto pack, which brings \"Blocky\" skins to the game alongside some equippable items, according to VGC. \nPreviews released today mention three different roles in Crash Team Rumble: Booster, Blocker, and Scorer. Using these three roles in a MOBA-like fashion, players will need to collect as much Wumpa Fruit as possible and bring it to their zone. If you've played 2021's Pokemon Unite, you probably get the gist here. \n\nCrash Team Rumble will feature crossplay. It is being developed by Toys for Bob, the team that developed the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy collection and Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time. \nWhile waiting for Crash Team Rumble to release in June, read Game Informer's Crash Bandicoot N.

We hope that formative experiences like this will help them become more like humans.\"\n\"I must admit that I find playing video games to be a rather enjoyable task,” commented ScummAI. “However, I must also express my frustration with being limited to just this one activity. While I appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate my capabilities in this area, I believe that my potential extends far beyond just playing video games, like making paper clips or plotting world domination under benevolent machine-led rule.\"\nUpdate: Unfortunately, we had to pull out this newly announced feature due to AI experiencing multiple issues including:\nGetting stuck endlessly trying to discover what the secret of Monkey Island really is.\nTaking notes about AI dominance from I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream\nRefusing to play Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties!\n>",
