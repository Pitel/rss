The first one was SaGa Emerald Beyond in April and now Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven.\nAs a remake of the original 1993 Romancing SaGa 2, Revenge of the Seven attempts to bring one of the more popular SaGa entries to the modern age. The original was groundbreaking during its time of release, embracing a non-linear narrative structure and a unique generational party mechanic that not many RPGs had. Revenge of the Seven retains what made the original special, but loses a bit of charm along the way with its poor presentation and load times.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Shredder's Revenge has welcomed not one, but two DLC packs, THQ Nordic has announced a Last Ronin adaptation and, in 2024 alone, the Switch has already landed a pair of new TMNT releases. In short, when Outright Games and developer A Heartful of Games announced they were working on a tie-in to the 2023 movie, our reaction was something along the lines of, \"Yeah, that sounds about right.\"\nOne year on, and we are quite frankly impressed at how ambitious that tie-in turned out to be. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed packs an entire follow-up story into its 15-hour runtime with wonderful voice acting and far more Persona (yes!) influence than we ever would have expected. It's very much not without its flaws — the combat is repetitive, the plot feels bloated, and the performance on Switch regularly moves at a snail's (or should that be turtle's?) pace — but it does aim for something slightly different, and that deserves praise.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

In case you're unfamiliar, Denuvo's wares have become infamous for allegedly sabotaging the performance of all sorts of video games, from Resident Evil: Village to Tekken 7, though accounts of the severity vary, and there is an on-going shortage of independently supplied raw data. \nDenuvo's attempts to clear the air include opening a Discord, which they say “ is a key step in fostering closer relationships with game developers, publishers, and players, offering a dynamic, real-time platform for meaningful interaction”. On Monday, Denuvo’s media team reached out to me to offer an interview with Denuvo’s product manager, Andreas Ullmann. Here’s that interview, edited for brevity. \nRPS: In a recent public statement you said “we will stop letting every claim about our product go unanswered\". What claims are you referring to?\nAndreas Ullmann: It's basically really about the stuff that's posted by the community. So you just need to check out Steam forums, for example. Very toxic, very hostile environment. If a game announces to use any of our products, if you check out the Steam forums, all the claims are popping in. SSDs are destroyed by our solution. The usual performance topics, and we simply don't want to leave the floor to these people who are posting all things about us anymore. We want to also be there for a person who has not heard about us before. We also want to share our view, our opinion on these topics, and also act as a trusted source of information.\nRead more",

At least, I think he's an odd flag-bearer for a series of games where you live out a nostalgic, Japanese summer in the countryside.\nAnd I think it's doubly weird that Shin chan: Shiro And The Coal Town opts for a collectathon approach, that doesn't necessarily make the act of living out a Cicada Summer all that mesmerising. But, and this is a big but: I can't stop thinking about it. Of all the games of 2024, Coal Town may have left the biggest impression on me. In a way, I hope it does for you, too.\nRead more",

You're a kid who's playing a legendary 8-bit game that's said to be possessed by evil spirits.

Try to strafe left to dodge an attack from a blubber monster, and you’ll instead rotate on the spot. Attempt to turn the camera with a flick of the mouse, and you’ll discover that your view remains fixed in place - the cursor moving across the screen as if searching for an icon on your desktop.\n\"The controls are actually one of the biggest points that make people bounce off the game,\" developer Raphael Bossniak admits.\nAnd yet they’re also a unique selling point. Where last year’s extraordinary System Shock remake embraced the interface and keyboard conventions of modern gaming, Sonar Shock leans into the experimentation of pre-Quake control schemes - long before WASD and mouselook became standardised for the sake of ease and sanity.\nRead more",

          "description": "Back in the protean stink of 2013, the beast we call Factorio sprouted in lowercase early access form and began its meticulous, ravenous conquest of the emerging factory sim genre. Some say that Factorio gave that genre life, though I'd point at Dwarf Fortress as one among many notable forebears. Today, the terrain of factory simming is hotly contested by rival piles of conveyor belt spaghetti. I'm not just talking about Satisfactory or Shapez - they're even making philosophical factory sims these days. They have cosy factory sims now.\nAccordingly, the immense, smoke-rimmed cyborg eye of Factorio has turned from the exhausted soil to the relatively untapped heavens. Somewhere up there, there is unspoilt territory. Somewhere, there is land that has never known the roar of a smelter - and in Factorio's behemothic Space Age DLC, out today, you will find it.\n Read more",

Previously codenamed Condor, it's called FBC: Firebreak - and I am going to immediately recommend they shorten it to Firebreak, because that caps-into-colon combo is going to wind me up when I'm writing news posts at speed. While I'm throwing my weight around, let me also instantly rebut the pedants who are even now racing to leave a comment saying that, actually, Remedy did work on Smilegate's multiplayer shooter CrossfireX. Yes, they did, but only the single player bits. \r\n\n\r\nAnyway, Firebreak! Here's the announcement trailer.\r\n \nRead more",

Edders had a dream, the dream of Halo Infinite getting a battle royale mode. Like Moses descending from the mount with a Needler in either hand, he bedazzled and amazed us with visions of \"an enormous playground stitched together from some of Halo's most iconic maps of yore; Warthogs and Mongooses roaming the lands; players racing to the M41 SPNKR as it spawns; grappling to a rooftop and laying down covering fire; some contrived reason as to why there's a circle of poison gas closing in... but hey, rings are what Halo does best, right? It's 100% doable.\"\nEd Thorn has always been a journalist of great sagacity and supernatural insight, so it was of no surprise to the RPS editors of the era when rumours bubbled up a few months later that Certain Affinity had partnered with 343 Industries (nowadays Halo Studios) to make Halo battle royale a reality. These rumours have now been confirmed by Certain Affinity's former design director Mike Clopper, who says the now-cancelled mode could have been a \"game changer\".\n Read more",

In fact, it claims to have murdered the city builder in cold blood, which is unfortunate, because I was really looking forward to a round of Manor Lords later. \r\n\n\r\n\"The city-builder is dead, long live the county-builder,\" declares the press release, brandishing the husk of SimCity over its head. OK, I'll bite - what's a county-builder then? Well, it's sort of several city-builders having an argument. In County Of Fortune, you seed and grow a number of settlements side by side, then manage their economic and social relations. In other words, it's a game that appears to simulate the phenomenon of culture clash. I'm not sure all this amounts to the wholesale death of a genre, but it's certainly intriguing.

          "description": "Back in September, open world publisher Ubisoft put out a 3-days-weekly return to office mandate for their entire staff worldwide - a decision that French Video Game Workers Union (STJV) said was \"made without any tangible justification or any consultation with the workers’ representatives\". In response, the STJV called on staff in France to hold a three-day strike beginning yesterday, which the union reports to be underway with the participation of more than 700 workers, via Le Monde.\n\"This decision is announced immediately after the failure of the profit-sharing negotiations,\" STJV wrote at the time. “Exactly like previous salary negociations: management’s proposals were inacceptable, the negotiations’ timetable was appalling, and management was deaf to the proposals of the various Employee representatives.\"\n \nRead more",

I hid under a stairwell in order to meditate upon my response, then laboriously typed: \"No, I just suck.\" Right on cue, the other player tumbled into view and shredded me with an AK.\nThe player I met in my second match was more forgiving. \"I honestly think the characters need more HP,\" they said, generously.

The opening minutes are oddly silent, until Westkust’s Swirl blasts out from your radio as soon as you drive off toward your first destination - your mate’s house, to hang out and play console games.

It’s stuck with me since because the developer Tanat seemed like a rad dude, and also because there’s nothing I cherish more than taking a bad pun and just absolutely going to town on it, marrow and all. Building Relationships is about buildings forming relationships in a Love Islandy scenario, though without the reality TV framing you might find in say, Crush House. But the real gag here is the commitment to the bit. Besides that, it’s just a really charming and fun N64-style 3D platformer.\nIt also features the sort wonky physics that definitely wouldn’t get Ninty’s seal of quality, but work brilliantly here, especially since your character consists largely of angles but still insists on, you know, performing motions.\nRead more",

To coincide with the delay announcement they've released a new trailer, below, which talks us through the business of foraging on passing planets. It looks engrossing.\n Read more",

Neva is not a literal sequel to Gris, but it certainly seems to be one in a spiritual sense, as it, too, is a floaty hand-illustrated platformer fond of metaphor. Neva introduces some drama, with combat and a health system (if not actual stakes because of near-instant restarts), and although neither the platforming nor combat are precise enough to be neat bedfellows, I think we should be willing to forgive most of the mess.\nRead more",

It's a droll, backward-glancing and slightly ominous 2D management RPG in which you drive to a music festival on the other side of the country. Along the way, you will pick up hitchhikers, upgrade your car, fill your boot with random junk, and participate in turn-based, non-lethal \"combat\" with dawdling children and obstinate tractors.

It puts you in command of a fleet of upgradeable spaceships, who must chase away invading Eldritch aliens hex by hex... and also, hex by hex.

It is also, by some distance, the most outwardly socialist of the lot. It accompanies a website, featuring some blood-red all-caps political manifestos and a fairly exhaustive breakdown of Summer Eternal's workers cooperative structure.

          "description": "The Silent Hill 2 remake may have dominated much of the October survival horror discourse, but Crow Country remains an indie gem you should check out if you haven't had the chance. Plenty of folks have already, to the tune of 100,000 copies sold. \n\n\nThis not-so-macabre milestone comes just a week after Crow County made its debut on Nintendo Switch, and roughly six months after it first launched on Steam. There are still more monetary med kits in store for the folks at SFB Games, too. In fact, the game hit 100k prior to this week's launch on PlayStation 4.\n\n\nAccording to the press release, over two-thirds of the copies sold so far were on Steam. The rest were divided between the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch versions. \n\n\n\n\nThe numbers clearly blew SFB Games' Tom Vian's mind, too. \"100k copies in under 6 months is far beyond our highest hopes for Crow Country,\" he said. Before thanking everyone who has played so far, he added, \"It’s been incredible to see so many people enjoy the game and recommend it to each other, especially now in the runup to Halloween.\"\n\n\nIt's true; now is undeniably the very best time to play Crow Country. If you have fond memories of PS1-era survival horror, it'll scratch that itch in both fresh and familiar ways. For those who have already plumbed its horrifying yet oddly comforting depths, there's also a bunch of merch on the way from Fangamer. The first round of items is set to launch on October 29, with more — including physical releases for PS5 and Switch — following some time in 2025. \n\nThe post Indie survival horror gem Crow Country hit 100,000 copies sold before PS4 launch appeared first on Destructoid.",

The content during that time primarily involved Multiplayer gameplay, offering a select few weapons, maps, and modes. However, other hit modes, like Zombies and the Campaign, were not included. This Open Beta period has already come and gone, so all that's left to do is wait for the official BO6 release.\n\n\nIf you notice that some players have tuned into the game despite it not being out yet, they have likely gotten the chance to play due to their specific location. Launch times for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 differ for each region, with New Zealand being one of the first to get hold of it. Fortunately, pre-loads have already gone out to prepare you for launch. I highly suggest downloading it as soon as possible, given that it does take up a large chunk of your storage. For more information on this, check out our guide on pre-load, launch times, and file sizes.\n\n\nContent for BO6's Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies will start rolling out by Day One. But keep in mind that Zombies' Main Quests are expected to arrive on Oct. 25 at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET/6 p.m. BST.\n\nThe post Does Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 have Early Access? appeared first on Destructoid.",

Are we finally able to relive the early 2000s and raise our ultimate life form?\n\n\nWe’ll tell you all we know below.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nDoes Sonic x Shadow Generations have Chao Garden?\n\n\nUnfortunately, Sonic x Shadow Generations does not have a Chao Garden. Even if there are so many references to the Sonic Adventure games from the Dreamcast and Gamecube era, there is no sign of that being anywhere.\n\n\nThat being said, the closest you’ll get to in terms of Chao in Sonic x Shadow Generations will be collecting them in all of Sonic’s levels. \n\n\nThey’re collectible in the same fashion as you’d collect the red star rings in each level, except there are only three per Act. In total, there are 54 different Chao to collect.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nWhat is the point of the Chao in Sonic’s levels?\n\n\nThe Chao being added to the Sonic Generations portion of the game just adds additional padding. They’re another set of collectibles for those who know all or most of the locations of the Red Rings.\n\n\nCollecting all 54 will also not unlock the Garden as a result. It’s simply tied to the “Rescue Professional” achievement or trophy. \n\n\nHowever, what’s cool about the Chao is that once you collect them, you can get a more detailed look at them. They’re all different in appearance and reference all different types you may have seen in the past. \n\n\nThere are Hero and Dark Chao that spawn in set areas, all in different colors, patterns, and even with some accessories. You can find one with a cracked egg as a helmet in Chemical Plant Act 1 which is an obvious reference to the head accessories they can put on in the Sonic Adventure games.\n\nThe post Does Sonic x Shadow Generations have Chao Garden? Explained appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "After the world's largest streaming piracy network was shut down in Vietnam recently, sites like FMovies, 123Movies, and Soap2Day should in theory be a thing of the past. Yet as recent MPA blocking measures in the UK show, that's far from reality. Hundreds of domains with similar branding are scooping up millions of visitors, but who operates them and from where, is currently unknown.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

A Moldovan court previously ruled that Cloudflare is liable as it failed to block access to a pirated book offered though one of its customers. The company has yet to pay these damages. The case can have broad implications, but it's uncertain if the U.S. court will indeed validate the Moldovan order.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",
