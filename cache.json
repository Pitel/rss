Nintendo's latest remake will run at 30FPS (down from 60FPS on the GameCube original), but this is not a decision that the developers will have made lightly, suggests Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon director, Abebe Tinari (thanks, My Nintendo News).\nThe director recently took to Twitter to state that they \"can empathise\" with the Paper Mario devs, drawing from their personal experience on Bayonetta Origins to explain why the game might not run at the higher frame rate that many were expecting.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

But you know what? Yeah, we can see it. Now, we're not going to sit here and say that it's going to be a genre-defining platforming and stand toe-to-toe with some of Nintendo's best, but it definitely looks like it's heavily inspired by the likes of Super Mario 3D Land and Super Mario 3D World.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

On the surface, Final Fantasy II is pretty similar to its predecessor, with one big exception — levelling. Instead of gaining experience points, your party improves depending on the actions they take.

          "description": "Truly goated.\nThough the peak years of the 3D platformer genre were in the late '90s and early 2000s, there’s been a bit of a resurgence in interesting new genre entries in recent years. Titles such as Glyph and Lunistice have shown that smaller platforming projects can be just as compelling as the more well-known examples, and now we have BogoSoft's Corn Kidz 64 continuing that trend with something decidedly retro. Following the adventures of a spunky goat named Seve, this title aims to emulate the spirit of an N64 platformer as accurately as possible. It largely succeeds; Corn Kidz 64 actually feels like a lost game from this era, and even though it has some notable shortcomings, this is overall an enjoyable and fun retro romp.\nCorn Kidz 64 is a true collectathon at heart, tasking you with picking up various doodads squirreled away in every imaginable corner of these modestly-sized playgrounds. Your main collectible is a large collection of cubes that grant you “XP” for each one you grab—after getting enough of them, you’ll be able to unlock doors that gate access to harder challenges that hide even more cubes. Additionally, there are other things to do, like knocking over all the trash cans in a level or finding a small collection of bottle caps to exchange for corn syrup, which raises your max health.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Zau do you do?\nThe best thing we can say about Tales of Kenzera: ZAU is that it’s a decent gateway game into the Metroidvania genre. The Switch is so chock full of incredible titles at this point that it can often be difficult to know where to start (we can help with that too, by the way), but Kenzera provides a relatively breezy 6-7-hour experience that should give you an indication as to whether or not to dip your toes in a bit further. For genre veterans, however, while the gameplay is certainly good enough to see you through to the end, there’s little here that hasn’t already been done elsewhere… and better, too.\nWhat elevates the game, however, is its setting and story. If you’ve been following Tales of Kenzera's development at all, you’ll know that a great deal of the plot takes inspiration from Sugent Studio’s creative lead, Abubakar Salim, and his personal experience dealing with parental loss. Incidentally, Salim (a stage and screen actor and the voice of Bayek in Assassin's Creed Origins) also provides the voice for protagonist Zau, and we have to commend the voiceover work as a whole; it’s brilliantly done throughout and helps the plot resonate a lot more than if we were merely reading lines of dialogue.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Over on YouTube, Tinker Man Mick has uploaded a Short (okay, it was uploaded in July 2023, so we're a bit late, but who cares) to demonstrate that some Switch carts actually have quite a bit of empty space.\nCracking open a copy of Let's Sing 2021, you can see that the board within does indeed fill the entire casing, while a copy of Super Mario Odyssey actually has quite a bit of unused space. Now, the video is titled 'Why Does Nintendo Do This?', but we think it's fairly obvious.

Metroidvanias stand apart for me only in hindsight - it's all about the precise ratio of abilities to ability gates, of jump-doublers to overhangs, all things that take time to assess properly. Echo Weaver sets itself apart early, however, by declaring that \"time is your currency\" and that \"when faced with eternity, knowledge is the only gear you need\", a phrase that, admittedly, I would probably have extended to \"...oh, and a spacetime-folding glaive that works like a throwable fast travel point\".\n  \nRead more",

Skybound are The Walking Dead company, so I wouldn't give you long odds for a bet on what Project R is about.

          "description": "Lethal Company is a fun game but I know what you're thinking: it lacks feline energy. Whilst the simplistic game loop of collecting scrap on monster-infested moons and selling it to an equally monstrous company is enjoyable at first, it can get old pretty fast. As both Alice and James have attested with their experiences of this month's RPS Game Club pick, Lethal Company is a game that lacks a certain direction the more you play. I soon found myself settling into an existential crisis, reminiscent of my tumultuous stint in retail. A recurring thought back then was why bother stacking shelves, only to have someone buy the products and make me re-stack them again?\nIn the vain hopes of gaining a higher purpose in Lethal Company, I stumbled across the 'Needy Cats' mod. Essentially this mod adds a variety of cats to your game that will wander around the facilities and yelp for attention.\nPerhaps I'm just a glutton for heartbreak, but I decided that the game needed a galactic sanctuary full of adorable balls of floof. I hearkened back to my time playing Stray, the adorable cat adventure set in a post-apocalypse where humanity was all but wiped out. Could this be the prequel to Lethal Company? What if all Apocalypse games share the same universe, all orchestrated by The Company secretly pulling the strings of fate? Or maybe I just wanted to look at cute cats instead of terrifying mannequin monsters. Either way, the cats needed help. What follows is a diary log of my adventures which soon lead to increasing madness and ultimately, disaster.\nRead more",

When will developer Zeekerss give us a proper singleplayer campaign mode, the loners of the gaming community wondered, peering from their boltholes and eyries. A Lethal Sole Trader, as it were - or failing that, how about some bot support? Well, this particular monkeypaw finger has curled. It curled about four years ago, actually, when Zeekerss released singleplayer-only horror compilation It Steals. \r\n\n\r\nI've been playing It Steals (available on Itch and Steam for £4 or $5) as part of our latest Lethal Company-dedicated Game Club, and let me tell you, it makes Lethal Company look positively, er, Nonlethal. There are many points of comparison between games, but while Lethal Company is geared more obviously for laughs, with its whoopie cushions and ReactionTube-friendly co-op mechanics, It Creeps just wants to scare you shitless.

This is true! It's also janky, and the RNG on the weird, warren-like buildings prompted me to ask \"Who designed this? What is this for? What kind of office is this??\" out loud, as I faced yet another dead end full of pipes. And yet! There's something about it that endears me to it far more than other similar games like Phasmophobia.

The price for this bundle - which includes a new mode, a bigger stash, and assorted gubbins - comes in at $250, or around two actual hundred actual pounds, but the price alone isn’t necessarily what’s got a section of the player base so tarked-off that a few of them are even loudly considering a lawsuit. \r\n\nThe actual issue is twofold: the edition is being called pay-to-win, and is also the only way to access said new PvE co-op mode, despite players previously shelling out notable nuggets for what was pitched as access to \"all subsequent DLCs\" as part of the now-delisted Edge of Darkness edition.\n \nRead more",

I'd just had a big swig of coffee before watching, and was instantly swept off by visions of an apoplectic Roman bigwig rampaging through the forests of darkest Germania, gluing abducted legionnaires together into a sort of Octavian katamari... and then they revealed that it’s another open world survival game, with no less than two trailer beats dedicated to the act of hacking down a tree. \r\n\n\r\nI mean no disrespect to developers Tarock Interactive - they're not to blame for my addled imagination - but there are many open world survival games and as a weary Ed Thorn recently noted, the majority are heavily frontloaded with wilderness carpentry. I don’t think survival games should emphasise wood-chopping in their announcement footage. It's like doing a Call of Duty montage of people getting shot three seconds from spawn. Still, if there's no katamari mechanic, the idea of raising a small army of mostly AI-controlled Roman soldiers behind enemy lines has a certain charm.

There will be new items for the Creation Club, including the Makeshift Weapon Pack, which lets you blast people with a piggy bank like Elon Musk, and a new quest, Echoes Of The Past, in which you try to \"stop The Enclave from spreading their dangerous ideology and gaining a foothold in the Commonwealth\".\nThey're also bringing the game to the Epic Games Store and upgrading it to Steam Deck Verified status. Such days of bounty we do live through, but beware - it's possible the update will break existing Fallout 4 mods, which will be a problem for the very large numbers of you who've been downloading mods after watching the show. Indeed, the possibility of today's update messing with mods has already seen the creators of the promising Fallout: London delay release to assess the damage.

As I run back and forth from the ship, only able to carry four things at a time in my puny arms, I frequently see the various monster inhabitants of the game excelling at pretty much everything. The Forest Keeper has brawny strength and can travel across the map in a blink of an eye, the Eyeless Dogs can sniff out an intruder in next to no time and The Butler has dedicated his life to maintaining a mansion even after the owners have long since gone.\nThis had me thinking - surely the various monster inhabitants of Lethal Company would make for a much better worker than myself?\nSure, most of them are ravenous killing machines - but that fits with the core values of The Company. After all, most of your time spent in the game will be collecting scrap on distant moons to meet an arbitrary quota set by The Company. You'll then feed your pilfered belongings to the insatiable maw of a tentacled horror (otherwise known as the boss). You may be able to sympathise depending on your occupation.\nSo, if the monsters in Lethal Company were given the chance to work for said company, which of them would make it as an employee of the month and which would crash and burn harder than me getting thrown from the airlock five times in a row?\nJoin me as I peruse the CV's of my favourite monsters in Lethal Company (as far as I know only half of them have opposable thumbs) and advocate for which of them should be my replacement as The Company's new hire.

It is - says dev Cécile, who co-made the project with Nat Pussy and MOTHER GOOSE for collective Domino Club - “a game about love and sports. it's gay, it's very australian, and it's great.” You can tell it’s Australian quickly, because people call chips ‘chippies’, which makes me chuffed.\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Alien-infested submarine sim Barotrauma has received a chunky update, bringing two new-ish monsters into its lethal aquatic world. The shrimp-looking Mantis may be recognisable to veterans (it once appeared in pre-Steam builds). And the Viperling is a venomous variant of the existing Spineling (a thorny seaworm with hull-piercing porcupine-like spikes). But don't worry, the medical systems have also seen a \"mini-rework\", which means drugs like morphine are \"less of a 'solution for everything'\". Wait. What?\r\n\n\r\nSubmariners in the game can still use morphine, opium and fentanyl to ease the pain of a monster attack, broken bones, wrecked organs, or be-bulleted body. However, the developers feel these drugs have been over-used. So they've rebalanced the opiates as part of their Blood in the Water update. Now the drugs have \"a much higher risk of causing addiction and overdoses, and morphine heals much more slowly, making it less viable for combat-heavy situations.\" Well. Guess I'll just die. \r\n \nRead more",

One thing I thought was very obvious is that it sanitises its titular conflict of any political context. On the one hand, I understand this as part of the theming, said almost directly into the camera by Kirsten Dunst's photojournalist character: as journalists they're there to observe, so other people ask questions. On the other hand, the civil war being between the government and the Western Forces, an alliance between California and Texas feels extremely \"Republicans buy sneakers too\", if you ask me.\nIt made me think about the Fallout TV show. One of the things I like about it is that it doesn't pretend The Brotherhood Of Steel aren't absolute mad lads (pejorative). Like, they're clearly not good news, and there isn't any attempt to make them seem like they are - just that they might seem that way from the point of view of a traumatised child being rescued from a fridge like a tiny Indiana Jones. Many of the video games I like pride themselves on offering choice to the player, but in reality they smooth over any bumps in the road to make the choices appear equal - rather than telling the player they are choosing between bad and good.\nRead more",

I built mine down a side road, between oxen posts and granaries, for no real reason but free space. The more I play, the more it feels a fitting place. Not sidelined, exactly, just not especially loud. I need the taxes it brings to pay mercenaries to see off bandits, but lords - their whims and ambitions - don’t set the tone here. Parchment and seals aren’t as important as tilled earth; as winter snow, spring thaws and autumn harvests.

We get a look at a new rural town and the activities you can get up to, like bounty hunting. Travel on your magic mech is compared to \"camping\", which I wasn't expecting. And there's lots of combat on show, with transitions from real-time to turn-based battles outlined in a bit more detail. Oh and it's coming out in October, which gives me plenty of time to clear my JRPG backlog before this inevitably takes over my entire existence for the foreseeable.\nRead more",

          "description": "What’s it like to watch a smash hit TV show set in the backyard of a game you’ve made? It’s a question which Fallout: New Vegas project director Josh Sawyer is uniquely qualified to answer.\n“The show really does capture the aesthetic of Fallout 4 and 76, while also feeling like it is set on the West Coast,” he says. “If you’re a fan, then you can see where the plot elements have been pulled from in previous entries. And if you’re new to it, thankfully, those plot elements are fairly straightforward. So I think it’s a good show for fans and a good show if you’re new to it, even though there’s a lot of stuff going on. I’m certainly interested to see where they’re going in the second season.”\nRead more",

The trouble was, all my friends liked football and I have an abiding hatred of popular things, a hatred that has obviously served me well during my later career as an online news journalist. I played hockey instead, which is the superior sport in that you get a big nasty stick, but also relatively niche because you need more equipment.\nStill, I've enjoyed rediscovering football in videogames, and especially videogames that don't treat football with much respect.

First, irate co-workers wield swivel chairs. Then, security join the fray. Then some sort of G-men get involved. You can punch, block, jump, and air-kick.

It's also left me powerfully invested in the premise of Blue Prince, a first-person puzzler which looks like a graphic novel and starts with your character inheriting a huge, weird, isolated mansion, Mt. Holly, from an eccentric great-uncle. \r\n\n\r\nLucky you! There's a catch, though: according to your great-uncle's will, you only get to keep the place if you can find its 46th room. The catch hanging off that catch is that going by its flatplan, the mansion only has 45 rooms. And the catch hanging off that catch is that the mansion changes shape between visits. Every time you open one of its many doors, you must choose from three cards to decide which room is on the other side. To find the elusive 46th room, you must \"draft\" rooms in certain combinations to unfold the mystery of the place and wiggle your way to its heart.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "From former Alabama head coach Nick Saban to previous Heisman winners, college football fans have made many predictions about who will be on the EA Sports College Football 25 cover. After months of speculation, a leak may help narrow down the field of potential candidates. \n\n\nCollege football reporter Matt Brown reports that the EA Sports College Football 25 will have multiple cover athletes for different title editions, featuring current players across multiple power conferences. Additionally, Brown claimed that all athletes play different positions, meaning there would only be one quarterback, running back, and more. Based on that set of criteria, there are a few noteworthy college athletes that check every box. \n\n\n\n\n\nTexas quarterback Quinn Ewers, Colorado quarterback Shadeur Sanders, Colorado receiver and cornerback Travis Hunter, and Georgia quarterback Carson Beck will be at the top of most college football fan wishlists. However, potentially only having one QB would make that list of top candidates much smaller. \n\n\nThis would also rule out all players who officially got drafted into the NFL over the weekend. Caleb Williams, Drake Maye, Jayden Daniels, Marvin Harrison Jr, and Malik Nabers could have been phenomenal candidates after shining on the field last season, but they have reportedly missed their window. \n\n\nAs for when players can finally get their hands on the highly anticipated sports sim title, leaks point toward a July 19 release date, with more information to come earlier in the summer.  \n\nThe post EA Sports College Football 25 will reportedly feature current players on the cover appeared first on Destructoid.",

With eight total Shikai in PM at the moment, you may be wondering which is the best Shikai in Project Mugetsu. Here's what you should look for.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nBest Shikai in Project Mugetsu\n\n\nThe best Shikai in Project Mugetsu as of Update 2 is the Nozarashi (Kenpachi) Legendary Shikai that was added in Update 2. Even though the new Ichimonji (Ichibei) Legendary Shikai is also very strong, it has no heal making it fall out of favor when compared to Bankai.\n\n\nHowever, an already existing Shikai, the Ryujin Jakka is also incredibly powerful with certain builds. The new Minazuki (Unohana) Legendary Shikai is also a solid choice, but is not quite as good as the Nozarashi or even Ryujin Jakka.\n\n\nProject Mugetsu (PM) Shikai Tier List in Update 2\n\n\nBeing Legendary Shikai, Nozarashi and Ryujin Jakka aren't exactly the easiest to acquire. As such, we've put together a Shikai Tier List updated for Update 2 of Project Mugetsu that includes all eight Shikai so you know what to work towards. \n\n\nYou'll want to strive towards obtaining the S Tier Shikai, but even the A Tier ones are formidable options. The B Tier Shikai are versatile enough to be worthwhile until you're able to move on to A or S Tier ones, and the C Tier Shikai should be avoided for the most part except in specific scenarios. Here is our Project Mugetsu Shikai Tier List as of Update 2:\n\n\nS Tier\n\n\n\nNozarashi\n\n\nRyujin Jakka\n\n\nMinazuki\n\n\n\nA Tier\n\n\n\nIchimonji\n\n\nSenbonzakura\n\n\n\nB Tier\n\n\n\nKamishini\n\n\n\nC Tier\n\n\n\nHyorinmaru\n\n\nZangetsu\n\n\nThe post Best Shikai in Project Mugetsu (PM) appeared first on Destructoid.",

You'll get to interact with fan-favorites Shadowheart, Halsin, Gale, and, naturally, Astarion.\n\n\nThe mod team says that only Astarion gets to be dateable right now, but Xun assures that Astarion will feature a unique romance plot and that more characters could join the dating roster in the future if things go well.\n\n\nThe mod still isn't out, but Xun's team has already completed the artwork for the map of Baldur's Village, four different styles of buildings, and the designs of Astarion, Shadowheart, and Gale. Below you can check out Astarion in one of many pieces of artwork teased by Xun:\n\n\nImage by Xun\n\n\nXun closes by thanking Himetarts and Wildflour for the creation of some free assets used in Baldur's Village.

The devs previously revealed four different editions of the title, ranging in price from $34.99 for the Standard Edition to $99.99 for the Supporter Edition. Players can find each version on Steam, but they cannot complete a purchase until the official release date. As to what players can expect on launch day, the devs urged players to be patient with overall performance of the title. \n\n\nImage via Madfinger Games\n\n\n\"We are working overnight to prepare all of the servers. We do expect some hiccups, but we are at it non-stop,\" Madfinger Games said. \n\n\nIf players didn't get a chance to participate in the original playtest, Gray Zone Warfare is a new immersive tactical FPS that challenges users to explore an island in Southeast Asia and attempt to collect valuable resources and items. AI-controlled enemies and other users will also be on the map fighting for survival. \n\n\nMadfinger Games CEO Marek Rabas also apologized to content creators and streamers for being unable to give out keys to test the title a week before release, but further fixing from the playtest caused a delay. It's unclear what time the title will go live, but players can either wishlist the game on Steam to get an update or follow Gray Zone Warfare on Twitter for live updates on the server status. \n\nThe post Gray Zone Warfare devs confirm Early Access release date appeared first on Destructoid.",

A common challenge is to get kills while Strafing, but if you don't know what that means, it can be tough to do. \n\n\nGetting kills while in Tactical Stance is a popular quest set by Sledgehammer, but they do tend to switch it up in the weekly challenges and slot Strafing eliminations in there too. In this guide, I'll explain what Strafing means, and how to get Strafing Kills in Modern Warfare 3. \n\n\nStrafing is a useful tool to have in your arsenal. Image via Activision\n\n\nWhat is Strafing in MW3?\n\n\nStrafing is moving side-to-side without turning your character. Essentially, imagine getting up off your chair and standing up, then taking a step to the right and back to the left. Doing this continually is Strafing. \n\n\nHow to get easy Strafing kills in MW3\n\n\nTo get Strafing kills in MW3, you need to get the elimination while performing the Strafing motion explained above. For a helpful advantage, make sure to use the Stalker Boots which boost your Strafing and ADS movement speed, while I find an SMG like the WSP Swarm is the best gun to use. \n\n\nYou should be Strafing all the time\n\n\nEven if you don't have a Strafing challenge, you should still consider adding it your bag of tricks and doing it during matches. Strafing makes you a harder target to hit, as the side-to-side movement makes it difficult for your opponent to keep their crosshair on you. \n\n\nIn a gunfight, it could make the difference between victory and defeat, so add it to your arsenal and see how much it can help. \n\nThe post What is Strafing in MW3?

Released at the tail-end of last week, the new strategy game from Slavic Magic has been making a bit of a name for itself over on PC.\n\n\nMaybe it's just because it's a new release and gamers yearn for anything new in this modern gaming era, but Manor Lords is doing quite well for itself so far. According to recent data from SteamDB, it hit a pretty impressive peak concurrent player count over the weekend, registering 173,178 players. At the time of writing, 87,901 are in a game.\n\n\n\n\nAdd onto that the fact that it's come straight in at number two on the Steam Top Seller's list. That puts it just behind the Steam Deck (as is always the case with these things – Valve's portable PC is nothing if not tenacious), but above the likes of Counter-Strike 2, Helldivers 2, and the recent re-emergence of the modern Fallout games.\n\n\nA pattern emerges - how long will Manor Lords' popularity last?\n\n\nAs I always say in these situations, it's hard to know what the long-term popularity will look like. We've seen the ups of Lethal Company, Content Warning, and Sons of the Forest 2. They typically have a huge boost early on in release, which fades over the course of a few weeks.\n\n\nBut there's nothing wrong with that. It's tough to get any sort of attention in today's gaming climate, especially among some huge titles from the biggest publishers.\n\n\nBut it's still an early success story. According to a recent post on publisher Hooded Horse's Twitter/X page, the game sold over a million copies a couple of days ago. Not many of us can make that claim now, can we? Also, for those playing, an update is being planned by the developer, which will fix some issues and fine tune a few mechanics. Hang tight. It's still in Early Access, after all.\n\nThe post Manor Lords hits peak concurrent player count as game tops Steam charts appeared first on Destructoid.",

Still, it's not exactly normal and errs a little too close to a long-abandoned system some publishers used to employ that saw games come with a one-time pass for story content that you'd need to pay for if you purchased a second-hand copy. \n\n\nScreenshot via Ubisoft\n\n\nAll the info we have on Jabba's Gambit points to …",

          "description": "If you're in the mood for some medieval-themed RTS-ing, maybe give Manor Lords a go. It seems to be doing pretty well on Steam, with a current review score of \"very positive.\" I know it's early days yet, but there seems to be a bit of buzz surrounding Slavic Magic's strategy game.\n\n\nAlso, if you have a Steam Deck, you may be wondering whether you can play it on the go. Get a bit of gaming in before you have to clock in at Evil Corporation, Inc. Who am I to judge?\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, if you want to be able to play Manor Lords mobile, it looks as though the game is indeed playable on Steam Deck. There are some caveats to that, of course, but the notes on the Steam page show that the visual options are running well, but there may be a few issues here or there. In any case, it should run on the device.\n\n\nWhat does it all mean?\n\n\nBefore you go rushing to play it on your Deck, remember that it's been declared \"playable.\" This means it's comparable to playing the game on a home PC, but may lack some of the functionality. In this case, \"some in-game text is small and may be difficult to read.\"\n\n\nWhen it comes to the Steam Deck, only things that are labeled as \"verified\" are 100% compatible. In these instances, the game in question has either been built with the device in mind or the developer has sent out some updates to make it more mobile-friendly.\n\n\nIn its current state, there's no reason why you shouldn't be able to play Manor Lords on the move, but don't expect it to be quite on par with a gaming PC. No doubt if the game does well, the studio will send out a patch, so keep an eye out for that.\n\nThe post Is Manor Lords Steam Deck compatible? appeared first on Destructoid.",

The company states the event will return in the future, but it plans to showcase upcoming games in a different manner over the coming months. \nFirst announced in a blog post, Blizzard plans to share details on upcoming games like World of Warcraft: The War Within and Diablo IV’s Vessel of Hatred expansion at other trade shows, such as Gamescom. The company also plans to launch “multiple, global, in-person events” for Warcraft’s 30th anniversary, which are described as being “distinct” from BlizzCon. \n“Our hope is that these experiences – alongside several live-streamed industry events where we’ll keep you up to date with what’s happening in our game universes – will capture the essence of what makes the Blizzard community so special,” Blizzard states in the blog post.\nA Blizzard representative tells Windows Central that Blizzard made the call to cancel BlizzCon and not Microsoft, which completed its acquisition of the company last year. In a statement to the outlet, the representative says, “This is a Blizzard decision. We have explored different event formats in the past, and this isn't the first time we're skipping BlizzCon or trying something new. While we have great things to share in 2024, the timing just doesn’t line up for one single event at the end of the year.”\nBlizzCon began in 2005 as an annual convention celebrating all things Blizzard. Last year's show saw the reveal of World of Warcraft’s next expansion, The War Within, as well as two other expansions coming after it. It's good that event is only taking a year off as opposed to being canned for good, and we're curious to see how the alternative events shape up over the coming months.",

          "description": "Dragon's Dogma 2 launched a little over a month ago and has already managed to sell 2.5 million copies, but Capcom is still releasing updates to patch minor issues with the game. While a large volume of complaints have been about the lack of a performance mode, this update (like the last update) does not address that issue. However, it does aim to clean up a number of irritating errors involving the behavior of pawns, the player's AI companions.\nAn update for Dragon's Dogma 2 is now live on all platforms!\nhttps://t.co/waEdG0ntSv\nApril 25, 2024\nFor starters, this update makes it easier to detect dragonsplague, an affliction that, if untreated, can lead to devastating consequences for your pawns and your world. It's also contagious, so it's a good idea to nip it in the bud as soon as you first encounter it. When afflicted, pawns' eyes will glow red – after this update, they'll glow more noticeably. The update also causes the disease to infect pawns less frequently.\nPawns should also be a lot less annoying now, thanks to a whole slate of minor refinements to their behavior. They'll jump off cliffs less often (which is hilarious but a wild inconvenience), say some lines less often, say other lines at more appropriate times and become less likely to offer to be hired while passing by on the street. They're one of the highlights of the game, so anything done to make their constant presence more consistent is always welcome.\nThere are also smaller adjustments, like adding the ability to zoom in on a character's face in shops, preventing monster attacks in town from leading to the player's arrest, and other miscellaneous bug fixes. You can read the full list of updates, as well as all past updates, here.",

          "description": "Taming a wolf in Minecraft is one of the game's simplest joys, and no matter how many times I start a new world, I always hoard bones in case I encounter one. But once you've adopted a canine companion, you probably hide them away in a house for safe-keeping, shielding them from the horrors of the game's hostile mobs. Today, Minecraft is adding a way to make them a little stronger – wolf armor.\n\n\nLike leather armor, wolf armor can be colored using dyes in-game, so if you've got multiple adopted animals, it'll still be easy to tell them apart. This variation is separate from the collar colors as well, creating plenty of possibilities. Even better, the game is also adding wolf fur variants for the first time, bringing eight new patterns for a total of nine. Each variant (Pale, Woods, Ashen, Black, chestnut, Rusty, Spotted, Striped, and Snowy) spawns in a specific biome. You can take a look at all the new breeds in the gallery below.\n\nOf course, players will need to be able to craft this wolf armor as well, which is where the new mob, the armadillo, comes in. These armored relatives of anteaters can be found in savannah or badland biomes, where they can be seen strolling around and curling into a defensive ball when certain enemies come near. Armadillos drop armadillo scutes, which are used to make the wolf armor, but the developers have reassured players that they can be brushed rather than defeated, so you won't have to go on an armadillo massacre to protect your pets. Armadillos can also be used to scare away spiders since they eat insects and arachnids in real life, and spider eyes can be used to breed them if you want to make your own armadillo farm.\nYou can read the rest of the notes for the 1.20.5 update right here.",

Epic says players who have these emotes hidden with this new setting will see a player using the emote standing still, with no emote sound. \nThis new setting can be found under \"Social Privacy\" in the Fortnite settings and it defaults to only show these confrontational emotes from friends in your party. Epic stresses that this setting does not change a player's ability to use any emotes. It is now live in-game. \nFor more about Fortnite, check out these Avatar: The Last Airbender skins now available in the game, and then read about how Fortnite's next Star Wars crossover will span Lego, Fortnite Festival, and Battle Royale.

It also reveals Metaphor: ReFantazio will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 11. \nDubbed \"The King's Trial,\" this new trailer sets up a bit of the Metaphor: ReFantazio's world more, highlighting a tournament for the king's throne at the center of the narrative. It seems our protagonist and the friends and allies they encounter along the way are vying for a crown that others are also after. In order to claim it, players must complete trials across the lands, proving their worth. \nCheck it out for yourself in the Metaphor: ReFantazio gameplay trailer below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Metaphor: ReFantazio continues to look excellent, with its Persona inspirations on full display. That's not surprising, though, considering Studio Zero is composed of various leads from Atlus' popular Persona series, including the latest in the franchise, Persona 5. \nIf you've played Persona 5 Royal, or even the recently released Persona 3 Reload, then you know we're likely in for a treat when it comes to a few things: combat, narrative, and art. And if this new look at the game's menu are any indication, the Persona team has been cooking something special for Metaphor: ReFantazio. \nThe trailer also reveals Metaphor: ReFantazio will get a special Collector's Edition for $149.99. The game's standard release will cost $69.99.\nHere's what the Collector's Edition looks like: \nMetaphor: ReFantazio hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 11, 2024. \nFor more about the game, watch the Metaphor: ReFantazio reveal trailer. Read Game Informer's Persona 5 Royal review, and then read Game Informer's Persona 5 Tactica review after that. \nAre you picking up Metaphor: ReFantazio on day one?

This includes a set of artist-specific rotating songs players can compete for high scores in, as well as unlockable skins, songs, instruments, and other cosmetics, though unlocking all of these requires the purchase of the pricey 1,800 V-Buck Festival Pass. Previous headliners were The Weeknd and Lady Gaga.\nEilish recently made headlines for winning a Grammy, Golden Globe, and Oscar for \"What Was I Made For\" from the Barbie movie, which is a task she's now accomplished twice. Even more recently, she announced her upcoming album Hit Me Hard And Soft, which is likely her main marketing incentive for appearing in the game.

The showcase will also spotlight co-op roguelike 33 Immortals and Don't Nod's upcoming adventure title, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage.\nFor more context, last year's version of this event included over 20 games, including Sea of Stars, Karateka, and Vampire Survivors again, somehow. Regardless of whether or not it appears, you can bet the comment section will be flooded with Hollow Knight: Silksong fans clamoring for the game, which we haven't seen since the Xbox summer showcase in 2022 when it was announced the game would come to Game Pass on day one.\nYou can watch the showcase next week on IGN's YouTube channel.

Stellar Blade hits PlayStation 5 exclusively next week on April 26 so this new track, appropriately titled \"Eve,\" is coming at a perfect time to keep excitement for the game going. \nThe song itself is pretty great, too, and the music video visuals are very reminiscent of Stellar Blade itself. If you're excited about the game, or a fan of NakedBibi, it's definitely worth your time. \nCheck out the \"Eve\" Stellar Blade music video by NakedBibi for yourself below: \n\n\nIf you haven't yet checked it out, there's a free Stellar Blade demo available right now on PS5 to give you a taste of what's in the final release. For more about the game, read Game Informer's exclusive interview with Stellar Blade's director for behind-the-scene details and more. After that, read about how Stellar Blade will have no microtransactions, with one exception. \nStellar Blade hits PS5 on April 26, 2024. \nWhat do you think of this song?

Although this technically isn’t an official announcement either, I'd say there's roughly a 99.99 percent chance that Black is involved.\nThe Minecraft movie, which has been in development in some form or another since 2014, is directed by Nacho Libre director Jared Hess. The cast includes Jason Momoa (Aquaman, Game of Thrones), Danielle Brooks (The Color Purple), Jennifer Coolidge (The White Lotus, American Pie), and Emma Myers (Wednesday). Minecraft is scheduled to hit theaters on April 4, 2025. \nJack Black is obviously no stranger to video game movies. He voiced Bowser in The Super Mario Bros.

          "description": "With huge winter game releases behind us and huge summer announcements right around the corner, the games industry is set for a relatively quiet month or two. Luckily, Nintendo plans to briefly step in to fill that void. Today, it announced the next Indie World Showcase, a live stream event focused on the latest indie titles to come to the Switch, for tomorrow, April 17. The showcase will air at 7 AM PT/10 AM ET and last for around 20 minutes.\nNew #IndieWorld Showcase incoming! 💡\n\nTune in tomorrow, 4/17 at 7am PT for roughly 20 minutes of announcements and updates on indie games headed to #NintendoSwitch in 2024.\n\nWatch live here: https://t.co/jGiccyBhME pic.twitter.com/V31Dfuxs0N\nApril 16, 2024\nIt's in the name so it might be obvious to some, but don't expect any first-party games or hardware announcements out of this event. An Indie World Showcase is also not the same thing as a Nintendo Partner Showcase, which is just a show about third party games. This can include indie titles (the last one had a trailer for Another Crab's Treasure, for example) but also includes larger developers, like Sega or Atlus.\nIf that's confusing, you can get a sense of the games that have been showcased in this type of presentation in the past by visiting the official Indie World site. Fans will most likely be clamoring for a trailer or release date for Hollow Knight: Silksong, the sequel to the 2017 bug-themed Metroidvania. But while it's (hopefully) right around the corner, there's no specific reason to believe it will appear at this event other than the fact that it's an indie game coming to the Switch.\nWe won't know until the Indie World Showcase properly airs tomorrow. When it does, you can watch it right here.",

The outlet’s sources report that the John Wick and Matrix star is voicing Shadow the Hedgehog.\nSonic the Hedgehog 3 is set to premiere on December 20 and will pit Shadow alongside a returning Dr. Robotnik (played by Jim Carrey) against Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles. The returning cast includes Ben Schwartz, Idris Elba, James Marsden, and Colleen O'Shaughnessey. The film's first trailer premiered in front of a select audience at Cinemacon in Las Vegas last week and it provided the first real look at Shadow. Unfortunately, the trailer has yet to be publically released. \nParamount has yet to officially confirm Reeves' casting, but if this is true, he will join fellow new cast members, including Krysten Ritter, Alyla Browne, James Wolk, Sofia Pernas, Cristo Fernández, and Jorma Taccone. Shadow's debut was teased at the end of Sonic the Hedgehog 2, but his voice performer has been a tantalizing mystery since the third film was announced in August 2022. \nMeanwhile, the standalone Knuckles series premieres on Paramount Plus on April 26. You can watch the first full-length trailer for that here.\n[Source: The Hollywood Reporter]",

This will provide a peek at the new graphical update, which spruces up the game with enhanced textures, shadows, material qualities, and other elements. You can download the benchmark here. \nThe benchmark includes a character creator for players to craft a fresh hero ahead of Dawntrail’s launch. It also includes access to the new female Hrothgar race. Existing characters can also be imported into the benchmark, and the appearance data from these characters can be imported into the full release of Dawntrail on Windows. \nFinal Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail launches on July 2.

Through these discussions, Massive decided it wanted to portray a \"resourceful underdog\" for its main character rather than the trained soldiers that star in The Division.\nIn the various meetings with Lucasfilm Games, Massive Entertainment looked at the various archetypes available to players…",

          "description": "Despite currently being in the midst of a crossover event with Avatar: The Last Airbender, Fortnite is teasing an upcoming event with a returning collaborator: Star Wars. The details have yet to be disclosed, but attentive fans of the science fiction juggernaut will notice something about the start date right away. The event is set to take place on Friday, May 3. The following day, May 4th, is known to many as Star Wars Day.\nWe have a good feeling about this...Star Wars is returning to #Fortnite. pic.twitter.com/6MCkDkolNb\nApril 15, 2024\nThe most newsworthy piece of info here, however, is the fact that the teaser indicates collaborations across several of Fortnite's new modes. This includes the classic battle Royale mode, the survival/crafting Lego mode, and the rhythm Festival mode, though Rocket Racing was notably excluded. Crossovers between Fortnite and other IPs usually just include cosmetic bundles, but this seems to imply that it will provide content for three different areas of the game.\nThe current Elements event pass technically includes a Lego variant skin as well as a guitar for Festival mode, so this Star Wars event could be as simple as that, but it's not unreasonable to speculate that Star Wars is a big enough property to warrant a larger scale crossover event. That said, this is just speculation.\nPrevious Star Wars crossovers included a Darth Vader boss battle, lightsabers, blasters, and force abilities, as well as a huge roster of skins spanning the movies and shows. Most recently, Ahsoka joined the fray as a part of the Chapter 4 Season 4 battle pass. \nIf you're interested in more Star Wars video games, you're in luck – we just launched our latest cover story, which features an exclusive look at Star Wars Outlaws. We've also got a hands-on preview, a video interview with the developers, and an entire hub devoted to this month's coverage of the game.\nWhat are you hoping to see from the upcoming Fortnite x Star Wars crossover? Let us know in the comments!",

          "description": "Total Eclipse, a real-time, curse-breaking, 3D adventure (with a dash of Indiana Jones flair), is ready for public testing!\nOriginally unleashed by Incentive Software Ltd. in 1988, Total Eclipse added yet another groundbreaking title to their repertoire of revolutionary games.\nStep into the shoes of a heroic archeologist on October 26, 1930, as a total solar eclipse akin to the one happening today over North America looms over Cairo. Knowing of the Ardognus prophecy, created by the powerful high priest Hahmid III, you must find and destroy the hidden shrine devoted to Ra before the eclipse occurs.\nEmbark on this exciting journey packed with a trusty gun for blasting through doors or dispatching undead mummies; a compass to guide you through a treacherous pyramid; a wristwatch to track the precious time left; and a water bottle to fight dehydration (you’re only human after all). \nCan you solve this ancient mystery within 120 minutes and avert catastrophe, or will Rah's wrath obliterate the moon?\nOur modern reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Total Eclipse support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC. More releases are coming at a later date. Additionally, there are three playable demos if you want to test the game. Please contact us if you have some other release or demo.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.\n>",
