Sure, in principal, it would have been nice if Nintendo were able to achieve parity between the two versions, but given the significant leap in visual quality from the original to the remake, we can also understand why certain sacrifices had to be made (sentiments echoed by Bayonetta Origins' director, by the way).\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Me too! Must have been the direct influence for Sea Of Thieves' new Season 12, which launched earlier this week with a bang - from two smoking barrels! Among the additions in this season of the ever popular salty sea-dog open-world adventure are double barrel pistols. They deal less damage per shot but have higher rate of fire, and you can charge them up to fire both barrels at once. \nOn the other end of the weapon scale are new throwing knives, capable of sneak attacks, light slashes, or, you know, throwing. You can nab any throwing knives you see lying around, too, which is fun. But honestly, the Bone Caller tool (the aforementioned jar of skeletons, which has a great Jason and The Argonauts vibe) and the Horn Of Fair Winds are are probably more useful. The winds from said horn can make your ship go faster, but can also put out fires or crowd control enemies, or for some reason make you swim faster? I don't think that makes sense, to be honest, but the horn has limited uses so as not to make you an unstoppable wind machine. \nRead more",

Fr. Justin, who was already kind of controversial anyway, offered the sacrament and claimed to be a real priest to Futurism, and gave the thumbs up to baptising a baby in Gatorade in an emergency.\nCatholic Answers (who have the domain Catholic.com; gotta imagine His Holiness wishes he'd moved quicker on that one) then defrocked Justin, making him  a lay theologian in a suit jacket, jeans and an open collar shirt that gives him a \"me and my wife saw you across the bar\" kind of vibe, when before he had the whole dog collar kit and caboodle.\nRead more",

I'll be rectifying that on 14th May, when Dread Delusion leaves early access.\nRead more",

I also distinctly remember making a not-completely serious but also somewhat true statement at the party about how that Tesco trip was the most fun I’d had in months, after which one of the metal men sneered at me. I felt self conscious at the time, but I’ve since grown comfortable enough with myself to realise that the metal man was a joyless fool, and going to big supermarkets is at least as fun as going to average metal gigs. There is nothing a drop D power chord can evoke in me that compares to the feeling of blurrily espying a chocolate trifle in the reduced to clear section. So I wish to bring your attention to Supermarket Times.\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Harold Halibut has the vibes of a game that should be 4-6 hours long and is, inexplicably, 10-12. It's inexplicable not only because it's a slow game low on interaction - the game is really just a plot delivery mechanism; a TV show you can walk around where you advance the story by pressing A - but also because it's a game created using handmade miniatures. It's a sci-fi animated dolls house under the sea, self described as \"a cross between a game and a stop motion film\", and if my game required that amount of labour I'd edit that script down. Then again, there aren't that many locations, so maybe you'd really want to show them off.\nI love miniatures, and Harold Halibut is beautiful. It's also a lovely story about finding yourself and your place in the world, even if that place is unexpected, and having the courage to take that step. There are unexpected silly bits and strange bits and bits where people break into song, and bits where you read undelivered letters. But, at the same time, I totally understand why some people would find it boring.\nRead more",

Metroidvanias stand apart for me only in hindsight - it's all about the precise ratio of abilities to ability gates, of jump-doublers to overhangs, all things that take time to assess properly. Echo Weaver sets itself apart early, however, by declaring that \"time is your currency\" and that \"when faced with eternity, knowledge is the only gear you need\", a phrase that, admittedly, I would probably have extended to \"...oh, and a spacetime-folding glaive that works like a throwable fast travel point\".\n  \nRead more",

Skybound are The Walking Dead company, so I wouldn't give you long odds for a bet on what Project R is about. Neither would I be surprised if Project C is unveiled this summer by a man named Geoff with shiny shiny trainers.

          "description": "Lethal Company is a fun game but I know what you're thinking: it lacks feline energy. Whilst the simplistic game loop of collecting scrap on monster-infested moons and selling it to an equally monstrous company is enjoyable at first, it can get old pretty fast. As both Alice and James have attested with their experiences of this month's RPS Game Club pick, Lethal Company is a game that lacks a certain direction the more you play. I soon found myself settling into an existential crisis, reminiscent of my tumultuous stint in retail. A recurring thought back then was why bother stacking shelves, only to have someone buy the products and make me re-stack them again?\nIn the vain hopes of gaining a higher purpose in Lethal Company, I stumbled across the 'Needy Cats' mod. Essentially this mod adds a variety of cats to your game that will wander around the facilities and yelp for attention.\nPerhaps I'm just a glutton for heartbreak, but I decided that the game needed a galactic sanctuary full of adorable balls of floof. I hearkened back to my time playing Stray, the adorable cat adventure set in a post-apocalypse where humanity was all but wiped out. Could this be the prequel to Lethal Company? What if all Apocalypse games share the same universe, all orchestrated by The Company secretly pulling the strings of fate? Or maybe I just wanted to look at cute cats instead of terrifying mannequin monsters. Either way, the cats needed help. What follows is a diary log of my adventures which soon lead to increasing madness and ultimately, disaster.\nRead more",

When will developer Zeekerss give us a proper singleplayer campaign mode, the loners of the gaming community wondered, peering from their boltholes and eyries. A Lethal Sole Trader, as it were - or failing that, how about some bot support? Well, this particular monkeypaw finger has curled. It curled about four years ago, actually, when Zeekerss released singleplayer-only horror compilation It Steals. \r\n\n\r\nI've been playing It Steals (available on Itch and Steam for £4 or $5) as part of our latest Lethal Company-dedicated Game Club, and let me tell you, it makes Lethal Company look positively, er, Nonlethal. There are many points of comparison between games, but while Lethal Company is geared more obviously for laughs, with its whoopie cushions and ReactionTube-friendly co-op mechanics, It Creeps just wants to scare you shitless. It's also brilliant.\r\n\n \nRead more",

What kind of office is this??\" out loud, as I faced yet another dead end full of pipes. And yet! There's something about it that endears me to it far more than other similar games like Phasmophobia.

I'd just had a big swig of coffee before watching, and was instantly swept off by visions of an apoplectic Roman bigwig rampaging through the forests of darkest Germania, gluing abducted legionnaires together into a sort of Octavian katamari... and then they revealed that it’s another open world survival game, with no less than two trailer beats dedicated to the act of hacking down a tree. \r\n\n\r\nI mean no disrespect to developers Tarock Interactive - they're not to blame for my addled imagination - but there are many open world survival games and as a weary Ed Thorn recently noted, the majority are heavily frontloaded with wilderness carpentry. I don’t think survival games should emphasise wood-chopping in their announcement footage. It's like doing a Call of Duty montage of people getting shot three seconds from spawn. Still, if there's no katamari mechanic, the idea of raising a small army of mostly AI-controlled Roman soldiers behind enemy lines has a certain charm. Without further ado, here’s the trailer.\r\n \nRead more",

Here is everything we know about the highly anticipated bout that will go down in history as one of the best fights of the series. \n\n\nEiichiro Oda divided the Wano Country Arc in One Piece into three acts. The third and final act includes a fight that will inevitably shift the balance of power and set up the final stage of the story. Ever since Luffy and Law originally formed their pirate alliance in Punk Hazard several arcs ago, the ultimate goal has been to take down Kaido. Unforeseen circumstances delayed that task, but the duo finally get a chance to fulfill their goal in Wano. \n\n\nWhat episode does the Luffy vs. Kaido fight begin?\n\n\nImage via Toei Animation \n\n\nIn episode 914, Luffy starts fighting Kaido. Amid a drunken rampage, Kaido destroys Oden's castle, prompting Luffy to challenge one of the Four Emperors to a battle. Without giving too much away, fans shouldn't go into this battle expecting it to be short and sweet. Kaido is renowned as the world's \"strongest creature,\" so Luffy was never going to take down the giant with just one Gomu Gomu no Mi punch.\n\nThe post One Piece: What episode does the Luffy vs. Kaido fight begin? appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Final Sea: The New World Saga starts with Fishman Island, as the Straw Hat pirates finally reconnect and begin their voyage on the second half of the Grand Line. One Piece tends to follow a pattern of alternating between short and long Arcs. Fans will notice that Fishman Island will feel much smaller in scope and scale compared to other adventures. \n\n\nYet that doesn't mean there won't be any world-altering revelations or typical Straw Hat crew antics along the way. Here is everything you need to know about the Fishman Island Arc. \n\n\nWhen does the Fishman Island Arc end in the One Piece anime?\n\n\nImage via Toei Animation \n\n\nEpisode 574 is the final episode of the Fishman Island Arc in One Piece. The Arc is 51 episodes long, starting with 523. If fans want to avoid filler, they can skip episode 542, a crossover with the Toriko anime. Immediately following Fishman Island's conclusion fans can also opt to skip episodes 575 through 578 as they are also filler that follows the story of a thief who stole food from the Thousand Sunny. \n\n\nAfter Fishman Island, One Piece dives headfirst into the epic saga of Dressrosa.

Specifically, the Ancient Processor Blueprint won't spawn during the Does Not Compute mission. I, amongst many players, have encountered this issue, but fortunately, there's a way to fix it. \n\n\nDDV Ancient Processor Blueprint not spawning solution\n\n\nRestart your game or start another mission to fix the Ancient Processor not spawning issue in Disney Dreamlight Valley. Many players have found that a simple restart can do the trick. However, if it's still causing you trouble, the second option might be your best bet. \n\n\nDeactivate the Does Not Compute quest and start another mission. While this other quest is active, return to The Docks and use the Hourglass. Remember that the item must be claimed inside EVE's hideout, marked with the star icon on the map below, as other objects will appear outside its boundaries. Once I did this, the Ancient Processor Blueprint finally decided to show up. You can then reactivate Does Not Compute to progress further. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nIn my experience, non-quest-related items can sometimes restrict the ancient artifact's spawn. You may also encounter the 'There is no more treasure in this area. Look elsewhere' notification when looking for it. Thus, if you run into these problems, use one of the solutions above to refresh it.  \n\n\nSome players have encountered this issue with other Does Not Compute items, including the Ancient Slate.

          "description": "After multiple delays and questions about the title's future, Ubisoft finally confirmed an official release date for XDefiant, and fans don't have to wait much longer.  \n\n\nUbisoft revealed that XDefiant will launch on May 21 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The free-to-play FPS title features 14 maps, 24 weapons, five modes, and five factions. One of those game modes includes a Ranked Mode practice playlist to test out 4v4 competitive matches.\n\n\nXDefiant was originally planned to hit shelves in the late summer of 2023, but a submission snafu delayed its release. Then, an October launch day also fell through because of party code and net code issues. After another delay in March, the FPS title could finally host a server test session in late April and iron out a few last wrinkles. \n\n\nImage via Ubisoft\n\n\nWith no more roadblocks in the way, Ubisoft laid out the framework for future content. After the initial six-week Preseason event,  XDefiant will get new weapons, maps, events, and a new faction every three months. Year One includes four Seasons that will add four factions, 12 weapons, and 12 maps. The devs did not provide any details about which Season players should expect to add an official ranked mode or private matches. Ubisoft teases that there will be more details about the title leading up to the official release date. \n\nThe post XDefiant finally gets an official release date appeared first on Destructoid.",

It sure would be a shame if an evil empire rolled up and started blasting. Luckily for you, a rebel fleet is ready to back you up against the dark side of The Force.\n\n\nA new Star Wars update is launching for Fortnite on May 3, and with it comes a massive expansion to Lego Fortnite. We'll investigate the crash site of an Empire vessel after it rifts into our Lego Fortnite world. There's a ramshackle rebel village that we'll help build into a Level 10. From there, we can launch assaults on Empire encampments throughout the island. All of this looks to be adding a much more focused narrative hook to the otherwise free-reign of Lego Fortnite.\n\n\n\n\nThis event will also include the addition of a Lego Pass. With a free track and paid track, you can unlock various structures and items by completing quests. Purchasing the premium track for 1400 V-Bucks immediately gets you Chewbacca skins for Lego Fortnite and Battle Royale. At the end of each track is a large construction unlock. For the free path, you get the Mos Eisley Marketplace. The paid path gets you the Dusty Durrr Burger Build. It combines the Star Wars aesthetic and a Fortnite classic.\n\n\nImage by Epic Games\n\n\nAlong with all the Star Wars excitement, this update also comes with a lot more Fortnite skins getting a proper Lego version. 90 skins will have new models, including Darth Vader, Krrsantan, and The Mandalorian.\n\n\nForget all the Star Wars; the biggest feature of this update is that you'll finally be able to view Lego Fortnite Quests without having to return to the Lobby. Thank the Force for that one.\n\nThe post Lego Fortnite x Star Wars crossover will let you build up your own Rebel base appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, in Gray Zone Warfare's PvE mode, you can forge alliances and find support almost everywhere you go. Discover how to play this mode and what it entails.\n\n\nHow do you play PvE mode in Gray Zone Warfare?\n\n\nSelect 'Joint Operations' at the main menu to begin PvE mode in Gray Zone Warfare. This option will be available once you've customized your character and chosen a faction. By default, it will initially be set to 'Warfare,' Gray Zone Warfare's PvEvP mode, so remember to change this spec. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nIn GZW's PvE mode, other players cannot harm you. Even if they direct a gun at you and start blasting bullets (trust me, I've had my fair share of this experience), no damage will be inflicted. Everyone works together and shares the same goal of eradicating enemy forces on Lamang Island.\n\n\nJoint Operations is more accessible than Warfare, especially if you're a solo player. However, AI enemies can still be just as brutal. Keep medical supplies on you always, just in case things go south.\n\n\nMissions are still the same in both Warfare and Joint Operations. So, don't worry about missing out on certain storylines. It would help if you also considered changing your region, which will be at the bottom of the Warfare/Joint Operations section. Since the game won't automatically use your current location, adjusting it for the correct servers is essential.\n\nThe post How to play PvE in Gray Zone Warfare appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Trying to make a build for anything in Warframe can be a daunting prospect. You need to find eight separate mods that synergize well with a specific purpose, level those mods up, Forma various slots so you can fit these mods, and find an Arcane that suits that build well. That build may not even do well after all that time and effort. \n\n\nOne of the new weapons added with Protea Prime's release is a good weapon to make a build for, provided you like the feel of the original variant. Here's the best build for Okina Prime in Warframe.\n\n\nThe best mod setup for Okina Prime in Warframe\n\n\nThe Okina Prime is best known for its high Attack Speed and Crit Chance values without factoring in mods, so we're looking for mods that further enhance both stats. This turns the Okina Prime into a dual-dagger powerhouse, dealing tons of damage in a flurry of attacks to overwhelm your opponent. The best mods for this setup are as follows:\n\n\n\nSpinning Needle (Stance)\n\n\nBlood Rush\n\n\nGladiator Vice\n\n\nQuickening\n\n\nPrimed Fever Strike\n\n\nOrgan Shatter\n\n\nWeeping Wounds\n\n\nCondition Overload\n\n\nBerserker Fury\n\n\n\nThis leaves the Exilus slot unused, though you'll be required to use a few more Forma on these blades to get something interesting slotted in. You can do that if you enjoy min-maxing, but it's unnecessary. You can also swap out Organ Shatter for a Riven mod if you dabble in that sort of thing.\n\n\nAs for the Arcane, I suggest you slot in either Melee Crescendo or Melee Duplicate based on personal preference. Melee Crescendo ups that initial Combo Counter, letting you dish out even more Crits with that heightened Critical Chance off your mods. Melee Duplicate, on the other hand, is more DPS. Who doesn't want more DPS?\n\nThe post Best Okina Prime build in Warframe appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The release of new Prime frames in Warframe is always a big moment for players. Not only is it a new way to get Mastery, but it's a fun rush as you scrounge up any relics you can to give yourself a shot at getting parts for the new frame and weapons. The normal way to get these relics is to farm them from missions, though there's another way that can be a bit faster. Here's where you can buy Relic Packs in Warframe.\n\n\nWhere to purchase Relic Packs in Warframe\n\n\nRelic Packs are available as part of the offerings of any of the six Syndicates, going for a rate of one Relic Pack for every 20,000 Standing. That means if you have the max Standing with a Syndicate, you can get six Relic Packs for a total of 18 Relics. The offerings of each Syndicate are found by accessing the appropriate console at the front left of your Orbiter's cockpit and selecting your highest-ranking Syndicate.\n\n\nIf you have excess Standing with any of the major open-world factions (found in Cetus, Fortuna, and the Necralisk), then you can interact with the mining vendor at that location to purchase Relic Packs for 20,000 Standing.\n\n\nThere's one final way to get Relic Packs, though not through Standing. By completing all nodes on the star chart and unlocking The Steel Path, you can interact with Teshin at any relay and look at his Steel Path Honors shop to purchase 25 Relic Packs a week, going at 15 Steel Essence per pack. This resets every Sunday at 5 p.m. PT, making it a good way to get a ton of relics should you play Steel Path regularly.\n\n\nAre Relic Packs worth getting?\n\n\nWhether you should buy these Relic Packs depends entirely on your patience. It is possible to farm specific relics from various missions, though you depend on RNG more heavily than Relic Packs. These are more efficient, though you could snag a ton of junk relics if luck isn't on your side. If you have a ton of Standing or Steel Essence collecting dust, then knock yourself out.\n\nThe post Where can you buy Relic Packs in Warframe? appeared first on Destructoid.",

The studio’s two founders are the only remaining employees.\nFounders Keon Deetman (CEO) and Paul Deetman (managing director) announced on social media that after the studio failed to secure funding during the Game Developer’s Conference (GDC) in March, it had “exhausted all our possible options for publishing, work for hire, and co-development.” As a result, the remainder of its staff has been let go. GameIndustry.biz confirmed that 13 employees were affected, 11 of which were full-time and 2 freelance contractors. \nThe Deetmans have made a call for any studios with open positions to hire its affected staff. The founders plan to stay in business and have vowed to rebuild, which includes launching a Kickstarter to crowdfund Deliver Us Home,  a sequel to Deliver Us Mars. \nIt was clear Keoken was in trouble when the founders posted a video in March revealing it had been unable to land a publishing deal after spending two years pitching five games to over 40 publishers. Instead, the founders decided to publicly reveal these projects to help garner interest, one of which was Deliver Us Home and two were Deliver Us The Moon spin-offs, including a VR game. \nKeoken once employed 45 employees, but the headcount was reduced to 20 by March 2024 before four more employees were let go that month. In an interview with GameIndustry.biz, the Deetmans revealed they had gone months without collecting a salary to help stay afloat.",

          "description": "Universal Orlando Resort has released a new video detailing what to expect at its Florida-based Super Nintendo World when it opens as a land in its Epic Universe theme park next year. In it, the company confirms the land will have three rides, including the Donkey Kong Mine Cart Madness coaster that's expected to open later this year in Osaka, Japan's Super Nintendo World. \nThe video includes digital fly-overs of the park, showing viewers what it will look like when it opens next year. If you've seen Super Nintendo World in Japan, this park looks nearly identical, with both the Donkey Kong Country (and mine cart coaster) section and the Mushroom Kingdom with Peach's Castle, Mt. Beanpole, the Mario Kart: Bowser's Challenge augmented-reality ride and Yoshi's Adventure dark ride. \nCheck it out for yourself in the new Super Nintendo World overview video below: \n\n\nAs you can see, the Donkey Kong Mine Cart Madness coaster will feature state-of-the-art track technology that allows it to create the illusion that riders will actually jump off the tracks, just like in the Donkey Kong Country games. \nLike in Hollywood's Super Nintendo World, which does not have the Yoshi's Adventure ride or the Donkey Kong expansion as a result of space at the location, and Osaka's Super Nintendo World, guests can purchase Power-Up Bands to play in interactive Key Challenges to earn coins and more. Plus, returning locations like the Toadstool Cafe restaurant and more will be at Orlando's iteration of the park. \nHere's a look at some of the locations to expect when Universal Epic Universe opens next year: \n\nFor more details about the park, read Game Informer's breakdown of everything coming to Epic Universe next year. After that, check out photos from our visit to Japan's Super Nintendo World, and then watch this vlog of our day at the theme park. \nAre you excited for Epic Universe and Orlando's Super Nintendo World?

          "description": "Square Enix, the company behind last year's Final Fantasy XVI and this year's Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, has seemingly canceled some in-development games, taking on some big losses as a result. As for why, the company is aiming to be more selective about its projects moving forward. \nThis news comes from a release related to Square Enix's holdings, which explains the company is incurring losses of 22.1 billion Yen, or roughly $140 million, on its financial books for the fiscal year that ended in March. \n\n\n\"At the meeting convened on March 27, 2024, the Board of Directors of Square Enix Holdings voted, in light of the myriad changes underway in the environment surrounding its group, to revise the group's approach to the development of high-definition (HD) games with the intention of being more selective and focused in the allocation of development resources,\" the release reads. \"As a result of a close examination, the company expects to recognize approximately 22.1 billion Yen in content abandonment losses on its books for the fiscal year ended March 2024.\" \nWhile potentially canceled games might sound doom and gloom, it sounds more like Square Enix is sharpening its developmental focus to ensure that the games it releases are hits or, at the very least, financially successful for the company. Nonetheless, it sounds like roughly $140 million of games in development have been canceled and it's unlikely we'll ever find out what they were. \nThis release comes after a big splash from Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, which Square Enix released in February. Elsehwere in 2024, Square Enix is releasing Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail, the new expansion for the MMO that will kick off a new saga for the long-running game, in July. \nWhat's your take on this news?

          "description": "Housemarque is celebrating the three-year anniversary of its hit shooter roguelike Returnal by teaming up with Dark Horse Comics for a graphic novel, artbook, and a new animated adaptation you can watch right now. This news follows yesterday's tease from both Housemarque and later Dark Horse Comics about Returnal, sending fans into an understandable frenzy about what the teams had in store for players. \n\"Another year, another cycle,\" a post on X (formerly Twitter) from Housemarque reads. \"The Third time around, extra loot is exposed with Dark Horse flair.\" \nHere's what that flair brings to the Returnal universe: \nReturnal: Fallen Asteria Graphic Novel\nReturnal Artbook\nFallen Asteria Animated Adaptation\nNow, even with PlayStation dipping its toes into cross-media production with Amazon's God of War series and Netflix's Horizon adaptation, this Returnal adaptation isn't the same. Instead, it's an \"animated version of the first issue of the upcoming graphic novel, Returnal: Fallen Asteria.\" Check it out for yourself below: \n\n\nHousemarque says the 88-page graphic novel will arrive in paperback on bookstore shelves starting October 22, 2024, and it will hit comic book shops the next day. \nIt's unclear if the animated adaptation above is the animated adaptation today's announcement refers to or if it's just the first part of it since it only adapts the first issue of the graphic novel. \nHere's a look at the Returnal: Fallen Asteria issues coming this October: \nThere's no word on when the Returnal artbook will arrive, but presumably it's this year. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Returnal review, and then check out this story about the PC specs required to play Returnal on a desktop or laptop. After that, read about Returnal's Ascension update, which added co-op gameplay and a new challenge tower to the game. \nReturnal hit PlayStation 5 on April 30, 2021. It launched on PC on February 15, 2023. \nAre you excited about today's Returnal news? Let us know in the comments below!",

Plus, a new update for Starfield is coming later this week that will make changes to ship-building mechanics and more. \nHoward revealed this and more about Starfield in a new interview with Kinda Funny, which is where the Bethesda executive producer also discussed Amazon's Fallout TV show and the Fallout series in general, as reported by XboxEra. As for what to expect of Shattered Space, Howard didn't say much. However, we already know it will bring new story content, locations, gear, and more to Starfield. \n\n\nAs noted by XboxEra, Shattered Space will be free for all Starfield Deluxe Edition owners. \nAs for the update coming to Starfield later this week, Howard says it will focus on the ship-building. This lines up with what the Starfield team shared last year in its 2024 plans for the game. Here's what it said at the time: \"For those who love ship building, we'll also be expanding on ship customization with ship decorations, new ship building options, and more.\"\nOther updates scheduled for 2024 include new ways to travel, city maps, mod support, accessibility and additional difficulty options, and more. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Starfield review, and then read about how Starfield is surprisingly great as a remote-play game. After that, check out this story about how Starfield is more like a sci-fi theme park than an open world adventure. \n[Source: Kinda Funny via XboxEra]\nWhat do you hope to see in the Shattered Space expansion?

The company states the event will return in the future, but it plans to showcase upcoming games in a different manner over the coming months. \nFirst announced in a blog post, Blizzard plans to share details on upcoming games like World of Warcraft: The War Within and Diablo IV’s Vessel of Hatred expansion at other trade shows, such as Gamescom. The company also plans to launch “multiple, global, in-person events” for Warcraft’s 30th anniversary, which are described as being “distinct” from BlizzCon. \n“Our hope is that these experiences – alongside several live-streamed industry events where we’ll keep you up to date with what’s happening in our game universes – will capture the essence of what makes the Blizzard community so special,” Blizzard states in the blog post.\nA Blizzard representative tells Windows Central that Blizzard made the call to cancel BlizzCon and not Microsoft, which completed its acquisition of the company last year. In a statement to the outlet, the representative says, “This is a Blizzard decision. We have explored different event formats in the past, and this isn't the first time we're skipping BlizzCon or trying something new. While we have great things to share in 2024, the timing just doesn’t line up for one single event at the end of the year.”\nBlizzCon began in 2005 as an annual convention celebrating all things Blizzard. Last year's show saw the reveal of World of Warcraft’s next expansion, The War Within, as well as two other expansions coming after it. It's good that event is only taking a year off as opposed to being canned for good, and we're curious to see how the alternative events shape up over the coming months.",

          "description": "Dragon's Dogma 2 launched a little over a month ago and has already managed to sell 2.5 million copies, but Capcom is still releasing updates to patch minor issues with the game. While a large volume of complaints have been about the lack of a performance mode, this update (like the last update) does not address that issue. However, it does aim to clean up a number of irritating errors involving the behavior of pawns, the player's AI companions.\nAn update for Dragon's Dogma 2 is now live on all platforms!\nhttps://t.co/waEdG0ntSv\nApril 25, 2024\nFor starters, this update makes it easier to detect dragonsplague, an affliction that, if untreated, can lead to devastating consequences for your pawns and your world. It's also contagious, so it's a good idea to nip it in the bud as soon as you first encounter it. When afflicted, pawns' eyes will glow red – after this update, they'll glow more noticeably. The update also causes the disease to infect pawns less frequently.\nPawns should also be a lot less annoying now, thanks to a whole slate of minor refinements to their behavior. They'll jump off cliffs less often (which is hilarious but a wild inconvenience), say some lines less often, say other lines at more appropriate times and become less likely to offer to be hired while passing by on the street. They're one of the highlights of the game, so anything done to make their constant presence more consistent is always welcome.\nThere are also smaller adjustments, like adding the ability to zoom in on a character's face in shops, preventing monster attacks in town from leading to the player's arrest, and other miscellaneous bug fixes. You can read the full list of updates, as well as all past updates, here.",

          "description": "Taming a wolf in Minecraft is one of the game's simplest joys, and no matter how many times I start a new world, I always hoard bones in case I encounter one. But once you've adopted a canine companion, you probably hide them away in a house for safe-keeping, shielding them from the horrors of the game's hostile mobs. Today, Minecraft is adding a way to make them a little stronger – wolf armor.\n\n\nLike leather armor, wolf armor can be colored using dyes in-game, so if you've got multiple adopted animals, it'll still be easy to tell them apart. This variation is separate from the collar colors as well, creating plenty of possibilities. Even better, the game is also adding wolf fur variants for the first time, bringing eight new patterns for a total of nine. Each variant (Pale, Woods, Ashen, Black, chestnut, Rusty, Spotted, Striped, and Snowy) spawns in a specific biome. You can take a look at all the new breeds in the gallery below.\n\nOf course, players will need to be able to craft this wolf armor as well, which is where the new mob, the armadillo, comes in. These armored relatives of anteaters can be found in savannah or badland biomes, where they can be seen strolling around and curling into a defensive ball when certain enemies come near. Armadillos drop armadillo scutes, which are used to make the wolf armor, but the developers have reassured players that they can be brushed rather than defeated, so you won't have to go on an armadillo massacre to protect your pets. Armadillos can also be used to scare away spiders since they eat insects and arachnids in real life, and spider eyes can be used to breed them if you want to make your own armadillo farm.\nYou can read the rest of the notes for the 1.20.5 update right here.",

Epic says players who have these emotes hidden with this new setting will see a player using the emote standing still, with no emote sound. \nThis new setting can be found under \"Social Privacy\" in the Fortnite settings and it defaults to only show these confrontational emotes from friends in your party. Epic stresses that this setting does not change a player's ability to use any emotes. It is now live in-game. \nFor more about Fortnite, check out these Avatar: The Last Airbender skins now available in the game, and then read about how Fortnite's next Star Wars crossover will span Lego, Fortnite Festival, and Battle Royale.

          "description": "Publisher Atlus and developer Studio Zero have released a new trailer for the upcoming fantasy RPG, Metaphor: ReFantazio, and it features plenty of new gameplay. It also reveals Metaphor: ReFantazio will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 11. \nDubbed \"The King's Trial,\" this new trailer sets up a bit of the Metaphor: ReFantazio's world more, highlighting a tournament for the king's throne at the center of the narrative. It seems our protagonist and the friends and allies they encounter along the way are vying for a crown that others are also after. In order to claim it, players must complete trials across the lands, proving their worth. \nCheck it out for yourself in the Metaphor: ReFantazio gameplay trailer below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Metaphor: ReFantazio continues to look excellent, with its Persona inspirations on full display. That's not surprising, though, considering Studio Zero is composed of various leads from Atlus' popular Persona series, including the latest in the franchise, Persona 5. \nIf you've played Persona 5 Royal, or even the recently released Persona 3 Reload, then you know we're likely in for a treat when it comes to a few things: combat, narrative, and art. And if this new look at the game's menu are any indication, the Persona team has been cooking something special for Metaphor: ReFantazio. \nThe trailer also reveals Metaphor: ReFantazio will get a special Collector's Edition for $149.99. The game's standard release will cost $69.99.\nHere's what the Collector's Edition looks like: \nMetaphor: ReFantazio hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 11, 2024. \nFor more about the game, watch the Metaphor: ReFantazio reveal trailer. Read Game Informer's Persona 5 Royal review, and then read Game Informer's Persona 5 Tactica review after that. \nAre you picking up Metaphor: ReFantazio on day one?

The latest of these artists is Billie Eilish, who announced her collaboration with the game on social media earlier today.\nFortnite Festival Main Stage: 4.23.24 pic.twitter.com/dxaQBsqD4A\nApril 22, 2024\nEilish is not just getting a skin added to the game (like Eminem, for example), she's the next headliner for Fortnite Festival's main stage event, which will start tomorrow, April 23. This includes a set of artist-specific rotating songs players can compete for high scores in, as well as unlockable skins, songs, instruments, and other cosmetics, though unlocking all of these requires the purchase of the pricey 1,800 V-Buck Festival Pass. Previous headliners were The Weeknd and Lady Gaga.\nEilish recently made headlines for winning a Grammy, Golden Globe, and Oscar for \"What Was I Made For\" from the Barbie movie, which is a task she's now accomplished twice. Even more recently, she announced her upcoming album Hit Me Hard And Soft, which is likely her main marketing incentive for appearing in the game.

Dungeons of Hinterberg is an action-adventure title announced at SGF last year that we got a chance to preview. The showcase will also spotlight co-op roguelike 33 Immortals and Don't Nod's upcoming adventure title, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage.\nFor more context, last year's version of this event included over 20 games, including Sea of Stars, Karateka, and Vampire Survivors again, somehow. Regardless of whether or not it appears, you can bet the comment section will be flooded with Hollow Knight: Silksong fans clamoring for the game, which we haven't seen since the Xbox summer showcase in 2022 when it was announced the game would come to Game Pass on day one.\nYou can watch the showcase next week on IGN's YouTube channel.

Knowing of the Ardognus prophecy, created by the powerful high priest Hahmid III, you must find and destroy the hidden shrine devoted to Ra before the eclipse occurs.\nEmbark on this exciting journey packed with a trusty gun for blasting through doors or dispatching undead mummies; a compass to guide you through a treacherous pyramid; a wristwatch to track the precious time left; and a water bottle to fight dehydration (you’re only human after all). \nCan you solve this ancient mystery within 120 minutes and avert catastrophe, or will Rah's wrath obliterate the moon?\nOur modern reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Total Eclipse support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC. More releases are coming at a later date. Additionally, there are three playable demos if you want to test the game. Please contact us if you have some other release or demo.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build.
