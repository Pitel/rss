          "description": "It's been a harrowing few years in our real world, and I often feel like I'm just trying to keep my own little flame of hope safe from the howling winds of indifference and despair. So Darkest Dungeon 2, a party-based dark fantasy roguelite centered on the idea of doing just that, ended up being a bit too familiar and also a bit therapeutic. Having well over a hundred hours in the first game, I was also pleasantly surprised by some of the ways this carriage-bound journey into existential dread changes up the formula… and not so much by a couple of others.\nJust like its predecessor, Darkest Dungeon 2 leads with vibes and attitude. Every bit of art and atmosphere is subtly (or not-so-subtly) menacing, worn down, and melancholic, with Wayne June's unmistakeable narration laying out the compelling story of a quest for answers that went too far. The background on how the world got this way is doled out in tiny morsels of tragic exposition after the conclusion of each run, so I always had new details to look forward to whether I won or lost. It's very clear that reality is, as they would say in the Bay Area, \"hella broken,\" and that it's somehow your fault as the nameless financier of these soul-rending expeditions into the darkness. But the nature of your crimes takes a long time to reveal itself.\nRead more",

          "description": "It’s funny how some aspects of game design are so ubiquitous that we stop questioning them, or even noticing them. After decades spent playing video games, I know that if I look behind the waterfall, there’s likely to be some sort of shiny goodie to collect. If I head left rather than right at the start of a level, I’m bound to find a juicy secret. There are conventions. Traditions. I can’t remember a time when games didn’t have giant lifts - and yet, I’m not entirely sure why they’re there. I’m not talking about the regular kind of lifts that you pile into, usually at the end of a level, to transition from one part of the game to another; those ones have historically been used to hide lengthy loading times, like the interminably long lifts of Mass Effect. \r\n\n\r\nWhat I mean is the lifts that are essentially tennis-court-sized moving platforms, usually with little more than a flimsy guard rail around the edge to stop elevator enjoyers from plunging down the shaft. Even more specifically, I’m talking about the diagonally moving elevators that trundle slowly into the depths, often to some nefarious laboratory. There’s a good example in the Resident Evil 2 remake, where you fight the final boss on an inclined elevator as it slowly, ever so slowly, descends towards the train that will grant your escape. So where did these giant elevators come from? And why do developers keep putting them in their games? I set out to answer both questions, and went somewhere unexpected.\r\n\n \nRead more",

And having played the first mission of the game at GDC, I can confirm that yes, this is very much in the vein of first-person Returnal. It's a fast-paced, bullet hell shooter set on a strange alien moon where everything's out to get you, but the shift in perspective makes everything in its titular abyss feel closer and more intimate, calling to mind the frantic, confined gun fights of Doom and Quake more than Housemarque's seminal roguelike - games that creative director Benni Hill tells me were formative experiences for him growing up. \nThere's also a greater emphasis on story-telling in Luna Abyss, with Hill also citing Nier: Automata and Bioshock as other key influences. It's a compelling mix, based on the first chunk I played, and arguably one of my surprise GDC favourite demos alongside The Thaumaturge and The Lamplighters League. Indeed, Hill tells me they started working on Luna Abyss a year before Returnal was even announced, and when they first saw it during Sony's PlayStation 5 reveal stream in the summer of 2020, he and his team did a collective double-take.\nRead more",

But look, if the park works, it works, right? The shareholders can't complain!\nThing is, much like with the internet or your mum's relationship with the binman, theme park simulators can really change while you're not paying attention. While part of Park Beyond's selling point is making literally impossible rides via the aptly-named method of Impossification (an upgrade to rides you buy by spending units of amazement gleaned from your slack-jawed guests, in order to strap a canon to a rollercoaster), I really was not prepared for how simulation-y the simulation bits are.\nRead more",

          "description": "\"What will ye do, when steel hearts break, and courage does abscond?\" reads the penultimate line of The Pale Beyond’s poetic prologue. Actually, it’s less of a poem and more a call to action: how on earth will you keep a ragtag bunch of sailors alive in the harshest conditions on the planet? If you hadn’t already twigged, The Pale Beyond is a narrative survival sim that puts you in the frostbitten boots of First Mate aboard The Temperance - a coal guzzling steam ship that set out on a polar expedition in search of its sister, The Viscount, which went missing five years prior. As Captain Hunt’s second-in-command, you’ll take daily requests from the crew, manage the food rations, and settle petty squabbles on the poop deck.   \r\n\n\r\nBeginning life as a way for co-founders Michael Bell and Thomas Hislop to create World of Warcraft mods, Bellular Studios grew alongside its gaming and Warcraft YouTube channels into a fully-fledged development team based out of their hometown of Belfast, Northern Ireland. The Pale Beyond is their debut game that fittingly draws on Ireland’s rich maritime history, although, as Hislop tells me, this wasn’t always the plan. \"We initially didn’t set out to do so, but it quickly emerged as a core influence that we kept finding ourselves drawn back to,\" he says. \"The further we delved into the golden age of exploration, and its very local routes, the more it resonated with us personally.\"  \r\n\n \nRead more",

When Firaxis were designing the moveset for each hero, creative director Jake Solomon says he and fellow lead game designer Joe Weinhoffer would take turns being \"point designers\" for certain characters. \"Joe was point designer on one hero, I was point designer on another hero,\" Solomon says, highlighting Magic and Iron Man as two of his own favourite heroes that he designed. \nBoth are what I'd call quite technical heroes, with Magic relying on careful battlefield placement to boot enemies into nifty magical portals, while Iron Man's most powerful abilities often only come from discarding other cards. But when I ask Solomon at GDC if he thinks he has a particular design 'style' that unites his crop of Marvel heroes, he says he loves being \"bombastic\".\nRead more",

It's the first project to hatch from Bohemia's incubator program, which helps indie devs make cool games.\nSilica is largely the work of one developer, Martin \"Dram\" Malicharek, who was previously the lead on Bohemia's Take On Mars.

Plenty of options, for sure, but Persona 3 Portable was the last time we could choose our protagonist’s gender in the series. Until now.

The four men, seated on tall Hollywood director’s chairs, were estimated to be worth a combined $11 billion - and that was in 1995 money.\r\n\n\r\nTogether, Dreamworks and Microsoft were going 50-50 on a new game studio, investing a total of $30 million. “I’m spoiled,” said Spielberg, as recorded by the LA Times. “I worked with the best studios and the best actors, and it would be silly to get into the interactive business without Microsoft. They’re the best company in the world. It does seem like a marriage that was destined to happen.” It was a marriage that would produce a famously strange child in Jurassic Park: Trespasser.\r\n\n \nRead more",

When you and your squad head back to your Abbey HQ, there are side stories and quests to investigate around the Abbey grounds, items to find, and more. It's a sizable part of the game, but at one point it was even bigger, creative director Jake Solomon tells me at GDC. \n\"It's crazy, if you go online, you can see all the Midnight Suns cutscenes and they're three hours long. That's as long as a movie,\" he says. But during the last year of development Solomon reveals \"we cut 30 conversations from the game, like 30 scenes. We cut a ton, because we realised this is just simply too much.\"\nRead more",

I was all about the chocolate. Sure, I’d crack open the yellow canister inside, let out some variation of, “Oh, an elephant!”, and promptly toss it in the bin and walk away, its destiny consigned to landfill. In the landfill of my brain, I’m currently carving out new space for Street Fighter 6’s World Tour mode. It's available to try now in demo form on PC and consoles, but I've been able to play a larger build of it that covered the first two chapters. Sadly, I can't say it left much of impression.\nIn case you're equally bemused by what SF6's World Tour actually is, this is a new, open world, RPG-style mode in which you make a custom fighter, run around small areas of Metro City and other locations around the globe, and level up. There are moves to learn, side quests to complete, and you can even do mini-game activities such as making pizza. Between all of that, you fight people. Other fighters, unruly gang members, random folk making their way to work in the morning. You can punch almost all of ‘em! There’s a glimpse of the Street Fighter you know and love here with its side-on 1v1 bouts, but everything else around it is unnecessary fluff. In other words, World Tour is the token toy inside the more delicious Street Fighter chocolate. \nRead more",

You know whether my complaints will bother you, so consider this a massive recommendation if they dont: Shardtide Verminp... Punktide Verminsha... Shardpunk... goddamn it. Hang on.\nShardpunk Verminfall is, as Graham reported, an excellent mash-up of several familiar games and concepts, yet doesn't feel like a knockoff of any, or lack its own identity. I would resent it a lot less if it wasn't also a roguelike. Even with its standard mono-save system and unlocking things and \"repeating the whole thing from scratch ad infinitum\" though, I can't pretend I don't enjoy it anyway.\nRead more",

          "description": "Valve revealed a swathe of new features coming to Steam's desktop client beta last night, and there are lots of new features that caught my eye. They're overhauling things like the in-game overlay, creating a new toolbar to house achievements, friends chat and discussions, and creating a new hub that shows you everything that's happened in the game's community since you last played it. It also introduces a cool pin feature that lets you stick overlay windows on top of your game - handy if you're following a guide, say, and don't want to keep alt-tabbing out. But there's one thing I'm quite upset about, and that's the new Notes app. I love a good notebook game, you know? Fiddling out puzzles in Tunic, remembering patterns in The Witness... Notebook games are great. But I fear this new Notes app will kill that kind of note-taking dead. And that makes me sad. \nRead more",

Sluggishness and stuttering are problems on higher-end graphics cards, even before adding the strain of ray tracing effects, and FSR upscaling often fails to deliver a significant performance boost.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Jako každý měsíc pro vás strahovští bastlíři organizují Virtuální Bastlírnu a jako vždy pro vás mají spoustu zajímavých námětů do diskuze. Kupříkladu co a proč se stalo s Sigfoxem? Spoustu novinek ohledně RP2040, které se objevily za poslední měsíc - nový Micropython, command line utilitka, podpora v Sigroku, projekt s podporou SCPI přes USB-TMC a další. Ukážou nové měřáky, které si do svých bastlíren pořídili a to, jak je ovládat a automatizovat přes USB/Ethernet a k tomu ještě jeden šikovný kus softwaru. Zjistíte také, jak fungují moderní RFID tagy v obchodech a jaké nové technologie výroby se staly dostupnějšími pro bastlíře z oblasti plošňáků a 3D tisku.\r\nAť už vás zaujalo cokoliv z nabízených témat nebo chcete ukázat nějaký svůj bastl, dorazte! Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve čtvrtek 11. května od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

Mainly P\nOne of the best elements of every new Splatoon splatfest competition is the fun splash art that is daubed to announce the occasion, usually featuring the game's hosts dallying about with the subject matter of the splatfest itself. And if you, like me, are a fan of said art, then you'll be stoked to hear that Nintendo has gathered together each and every piece, newly curated in an online gallery.\n\nThe gallery features the artwork for almost every splatfest to date, from the original Splatoon all the way through to Splatoon 3, funkily daubed by the series' long-term art director Seita Inoue.\nFrom Splatoon's Squid Sisters, Callie and Marie, through Splatoon 2 rap-rock group Off the Hook — better known as Pearl and Marina — to Splatoon 3's trinity of Shiver, Frye, and Big Man, each and every contest is accounted for. Ketchup vs. Mayo, Action vs. Comedy, Chicken vs. Egg, Movies vs. Books, and even the bizarre \"Pocky Sticks with More Chocolate vs. Pocky Sticks with Less Chocolate.\n\nAt first glance, there seems to be a lot of artwork missing but be sure to click on the links on each piece to switch out for alternates, that way you can also see some of the licensed splatfests — special events that featured collaborations with brands such as Pokemon, TMNT, and Hello Kitty. It's definitely lovely to see all of this fun 'n' funny artwork once again, even though I can't help but feel a pang of wistful nostalgia for my gurls P&M. I'm glad that some of the old hosts make a cameo from time to time.\nYou can visit the Splatoon splatfest art gallery right here.\nSplatoon 3 is available now on Nintendo Switch.

          "description": "Surf or turf\nCrunching Koalas and Dexai Arts have shown off their narrative bouncer game Techno Banter, which is coming to PC and consoles sometime this year.\nI think Techno Banter is a narrative game, but none of the press material tells me how it describes itself. The trailer that dropped alongside the announcement at least points to this. There’s some first-person movement and talking to people, but no sign of, say, puzzles or combat. It mixes 3D environments with 2D pixel art characters, and the aesthetic is inspired by the Berlin techno scene.\nhttps://youtu.be/d0hiE-LnOD0\nTechno Banter casts you as a bouncer at a club. The gameplay focuses on deciding who to let through to enjoy the club and who to throw to the turf. Everywhere I look, Techno Banter keeps pointing out its “witty” dialogue. I’m not putting that in quotes to be disparaging. That’s actually how they describe it in the press release.\nConstantly pointing to your own humor is a bit of a red flag for me. If you’re funny, you don’t have to tell people you’re funny. I don’t tell people I’m funny, but that’s mostly because it would be flagrantly incorrect.\nThe trailer doesn’t really show off any of this dialogue or even imply that it’s going for the humorous approach. However, it does show off an excellently executed aesthetic. I guess what I’m saying is I’m curious. I may not have a very clear idea of what Techno Banter wants from me, but I'm willing to give it a look.\nTechno Banter is coming to PC and consoles sometime in 2023\nThe post Techno Banter makes you a bouncer in a weird world appeared first on Destructoid.",

The great-looking sequel remains in development for PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.\n\"Hey gang, just a quick update about Silksong,\" wrote Team Cherry marketer Matthew Griffin on Twitter. \"We had planned to release in the 1st half of 2023, but development is still continuing. We’re excited by how the game is shaping up, and it’s gotten quite big, so we want to take the time to make the game as good as we can. Expect more details from us once we get closer to release.\"\nhttps://twitter.com/griffinmatta/status/1656106351184199680?s=20\nThe sequel to the award-winning 2017 bug-based escapade, Hollow Knight: Silksong was first projected as DLC for the original game, before the scope and scale of the project led Team Cherry to develop it as a fully-fledged sequel. Since then, it has become a bit of a running gag among the community, as a confirmed release date continues to evade the eager fans. This latest pushback will no doubt garner further sighs, but we can have faith in Team Cherry's ability to deliver the goods when the fateful day arrives.\nHollow Knight: Silksong will follow the adventure of the former antagonist-turned-friend Hornet, who finds herself a prisoner of the troubled kingdom of Pharloom. Utilizing her acrobatic abilities and deadly precision, Hornet embarks on a quest to escape the new world while learning of the reason behind her capture.\nHollow Knight: Silksong is currently in development for PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Hollow Knight: Silksong delayed as project scale continues to grow appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Sixth consecutive year of growth for veteran developer\nCapcom has released its latest financial earnings report, which records the sixth consecutive year of profit growth for the Resident Evil and Street Fighter publisher — The publishing of the new report has also affected the company's share value, which spiked to an all-time high earlier this morning.\nAccording to the numbers, Capcom sold 41.7 million games for the period ending March 31, 2023. This number not only represents a 10 million sales boost from the previous year, but is also the largest year-on-year sales growth in the company's entire history. The boost in sales is attributed to two titles in particular: survival horror remake Resident Evil 4 and the epic fantasy adventure Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak.\n\nThese impressive sales figures also include the continued success of the Capcom catalog, with titles such as Devil May Cry 5, Resident Evil Village, Resident Evil 2 & 3, Monster Hunter World, and The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles. Capcom already has several more titles on deck for the remainder of 2023, including dino-hunter Exoprimal and handheld remaster Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective. Capcom's biggest upcoming release, however, is inarguably Street Fighter 6, which launches on PC and console platforms June 2. The publisher has already set a target of 10 million sales for the new sequel.\n\nThe Capcom success story can be traced back to the launch of Monster Hunter: World back in the winter of 2017. Following a period of decline that saw disappointing launches for Street Fighter V and Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite, Monster Hunter: World would not only go on to be the publisher's best-selling release of all time, but would kick off a series of hugely successful releases for Capcom, resulting in the most lucrative period in the company's 40-year history, as defined in today's report.\nThe post Capcom riding high on record sales and increasing share value appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Dash and leap\nAtari is showing off their upcoming platformer, Mr. Run and Jump, which is set to launch this year on PC and consoles.\nMr. Run and Jump allegedly started its life as a homebrew experiment for the Atari 2600 at Graphite Lab, a frequent partner of Atari’s. Afterwards, the publisher liked what they saw and commissioned a more modernized take on it. It appears to be a fast-paced, die-and-retry platformer with neon visuals. In other words, its name does a pretty good job of summing it up! There is definitely some running and jumping going on here. Perhaps even some hopping, but no bopping. Bopping looks fatal.\nhttps://youtu.be/VHIpL5Mz1JY\nI’ll be honest here, I’d be more interested in seeing the homebrew original in action. That’s not a sleight against Mr. Run and Jump, I guess I just think that a game made in the constraints of an old console is more fascinating than a 2D platformer made on modern hardware. I'm also not a huge fan of the die-and-retry genre, and that includes classic examples such as Celeste and Super Meat Boy. Just not my jam.\nThat said, I dig the style on display here. The neon visuals fit in with what Atari seems to have been going for recently, which is sort of a modernized re-interpretation of what could be pushed in the primordial days of consoles. It also looks to be in a similar vein as Graphite Labs' previous game, Kombinera. I never played it, but it was very well-received.\nMr. Run and Jump is looking to drop this year on PC, Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Atari VCS (the modern one).\nThe post Atari to deliver retro-pop with Mr. Run and Jump this year appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Not just a novelty\nBitwave Games has announced that Gimmick! Special Edition will be coming to PC and console on July 6, 2023.\nInitially released by Sunsoft in Japan in 1992, followed by a very limited release in PAL regions as Mr. Gimmick in 1993, Gimmick! is a game cherished by NES fans who are in the know. The PAL version is among the most expensive NES cartridges on the system and isn’t cheap on the Famicom either. As such, a modern port has been a long time coming.\nhttps://youtu.be/Rb8KGQVksp0\nGimmick! has you play as a horned, green blob who can throw stars. While it’s simple on the surface, it requires you to master the heavily physics-influenced gameplay. It can be a rather tricky game that requires you to become intimately familiar with its movements.\nI’ve personally bounced off Gimmick! More than a few times, but I know a number of gamers who are passionate about it. Gimmick! Special Edition is looking to preserve the gameplay while bringing a few extra tweaks alongside. There’s a speed-run mode and some other quality-of-life upgrades (that can be disabled). There’s also a save and reload function so you don’t have to complete the game in one sitting. Beyond that, there’s the now standard rewind feature to smooth over the more difficult aspects. If you found the original version too punishing, this could be your chance to finally finish it.\nGimmick! Special Edition launches on PC, Switch, and PS4 on July 6, 2023. The Xbox version will follow shortly after. There are physical versions of the games coming for Switch and PS4, and they’ll be arriving at retailers later this year.\nThe post Hidden NES gem Gimmick! Special Edition gets July 6 release date appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "An elephant never forgets\nArmor Games Studios has announced that they’re bringing a collection of John Cooney’s Flash games back in The Elephant Collection.\nDo you remember Flash games? I don’t, but a lifetime of self-inflicted concussions will do that to you. For those like myself who only house a big blank space, Flash was an animation platform that some internet denizens would twist to make games. It was ahead of its time, putting powerful (but flawed) tools in the hands of everyone.\nHold on. A number of repressed memories are returning to haunt me....\nNewgrounds was the nexus for these experiments, and The Elephant Collection compiles a number of high-profile games from those days. Each of these games stars a blue elephant, and many of them are a subtle (or not-so-subtle) commentary on the games industry at the time. These include the mind-bending This is the Only Level and the more on-the-nose Achievement Unlocked.\nhttps://youtu.be/-Hf91nIk3zI\nWith Flash getting sucked down the Adobe tube and replaced with a disparate selection of other platforms that don’t have quite the same security issues, a lot of people have been left trying to preserve what is at risk of being lost. In that regard, The Elephant Collection is an important glimpse of a part of the past that could otherwise be forgotten.\nTo be clear, Newgrounds does still exist, and these games can still be run using the Newgrounds Player. That would be the site’s own (effective) attempt at preserving its content. The collection, however, will upgrade the quality of these games, rather than just present them as-is. I’d just warn caution in re-visiting Newgrounds, as its reminder of better days may suck you down memory lane. I’m seriously getting kind of misty-eyed here.\nThe Elephant Collection is coming to PC sometime in 2023.\nThe post The Elephant Collection compiles some legendary Flash games appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Not a redemption; that’s the game’s title\nCreative Bytes Studios has announced their next game, Return to Grace, a sci-fi adventure about restoring an AI. It’s set to release on May 30, 2023.\nWhat’s that? You don’t want to save an AI because they might steal someone’s job? Understandable. But what if it’s a ‘60s interpretation of an AI? If that’s more your speed, then step into the boots of Adamari “Adie” Ito, and get ready for a retro-futuristic adventure.\nhttps://youtu.be/2ipja8eFd1M\nReturn to Grace puts you in the year 3820AD where Adie is looking into the disappearance of “Grace,” an ancient AI that was once known as “humanity’s most significant technological achievement.” There’s absolutely no way that it could have turned evil or be remorseful. Right?\nFall from Grace will have you solving puzzles on Ganymede. There are multiple endings depending on your “playstyle and decisions.” The developer is also touting that the game is fully voiced, and you’ll be joined by a “cast of character AIs” that will “provide humor and perspective.”\nI dig the art-style here. Creative Bytes Studios was formed by some former Silicon Knights staff. Dave Evans and Paul Caporicci are prominent, with both having worked on Too Human, while Paul Caporicci goes back to Metal Gear Solid: Twin Snakes. While I’m mostly a fan of Silicon Knights’ Eternal Darkness: Sanity’s Requiem, I appreciate the heritage.\nReturn to Grace is currently slated for PC.

          "description": "One billion Switch games sold to date\nNintendo has revealed the newest sales figures regarding its Nintendo Switch platform, which sees the console pass the 125 million unit mark, as well as hitting an all-time record in regards to software sales.\nAccording to the data, 3.07 million Nintendo Switch consoles were sold during the first quarter of 2023, (ending March 31), which pushes total unit sales to 125.62 million. While an additional three million sold Switch consoles is not to be sniffed at, it does represent a huge 22% sales drop on the previous year, continuing a downward trend for Switch hardware sales in general. At this rate, it seems very unlikely that the Switch will surpass the sales of Nintendo's best-selling hardware, Nintendo DS, which closed on a staggering 154 million units — making it the second best selling console of all time.\nNintendo is openly aware of the sales decline, but still hopes to sell a further 15 million units by the end of March 2024. Speaking in a conference call attended by Bloomberg, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa called the target \"a bit of stretch\", but hopes that the holiday season will help the company to hit its targets. Furukawa said that no new or upgraded hardware was being factored into the prediction, somewhat furthering whispers that the company has no plans to release a new edition of the Switch in the near future.\nIn regard to software sales, Switch has shipped 1.036 billion games since its launch, which is the most titles ever shipped for any Nintendo platform. The three best-selling first-party titles remain Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (53.79 million), Animal Crossing: New Horizons (42.21 million), and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (31.09 million). Nintendo's next major release, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, launches this week, and is expected to carry the lion's share of the company's software revenue for 2023.\nThe post Nintendo Switch surpasses 125 million sales, but decline trend continues appeared first on Destructoid.",

Are you expecting a palette of rusted metals, fog greys, and rotted flesh reds? I kid, of course, but it will genuinely be interesting to see how the grisly, depressing world of Silent Hill is reproduced in a beauty line. Vampyre Cosmetics, as the name suggests, is pretty sharp at adapting the darker side of make-up, so I'm looking forward to seeing what is eventually produced.\nhttps://twitter.com/TeamSilentHill/status/1654521071326863360?s=20\nThis is, of course, a pretty big year for the missing-in-action survival horror franchise. As revealed during the Fall 2022 Silent Hill Transmission stream, there are currently multiple projects in production at Konami, including Christophe Gans’ live-action movie Return to Silent Hill, streaming series Silent Hill: Ascension, Annapurna spin-off Silent Hill: Townfall and, of course, Bloober Team's incoming remake of 2001 classic Silent Hill 2. So you can paint yourself up in the new line of Vampyre Cosmetics, and perhaps, if your make-up skills match mine, you can be the scariest thing in town.\nSilent Hill 2 is currently in development for PS5 and PC.\nThe post Silent Hill is teaming with Vampyre Cosmetics for new… make-up line? appeared first on Destructoid.",

Especially if you've been there since the very beginning with that golden NES cartridge. Nintendo has created so many great adventures across Hyrule over the past thirty years that it can be easy to find your brain overstuffed with memories of the green-clad kid with the sword and the pointy hat. It's hard to pick exactly which moment from the franchise is the best, but it's a bit easier to decide which of the many quotes from the series reigns supreme.\nThat's what we're looking at with this listicle.

Her return triggers a flood of childhood memories, which players relieve in flashbacks as a child version of Mimi. Gameplay involves exploring the cottage, taking pictures, and collecting keepsakes while witnessing the bond between Mimi and her grandmother and learning how these nostalgic experiences connect to the present. Check out the game's new trailer below, as the game looks even prettier in motion. \n\n\nDordogne comes from developers Umanimation and UN JE NE SAIS QUOI and will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.",

Requiem on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S gets a performance mode that lets players run the game at 60 FPS in exchange for a lower resolution. \nMeanwhile, the PC version is getting enhanced graphics options that allow players to further optimize presentational performance. Lastly, all versions of the game, including the Switch cloud port, will receive bug fixes via this patch.\nWe enjoyed A Plague Tale: Requiem, with editor Wesley LeBlanc scoring the game an 8 out of 10 in his review, which you can read here.

While the game received several free DLCs, the studio was also working on a larger expansion of paid DLC starring Hornet from the game. In 2019, the team announced this DLC had expanded massively in scope, to the point it'd now be a full sequel game called Hollow Knight: Silksong. Since then, fans of the first Hollow Knight have wondered when they'd be able to play Silksong.\nWhile waiting to learn more, read Game Informer's Hollow Knight review and then read about why Silksong is one of our most anticipated upcoming games. \nAre you excited for Silksong?

It will publish a new action-adventure game from Game Freak meant to be a new IP for the developer. \nCodenamed \"Project Bloom,\" Game Freak and Private Division state in a press release the new IP is expected to launch during Private Division parent company Take-Two's Fiscal Year 2026. Alongside this news, Game Freak has released the first piece of concept art for Project Bloom. You can check it out below: \n\n\"We're thrilled to have the opportunity to create new IP that is bold and tonally different from our prior work,\" Game Freak director Kota Furushima writes in the release. \"From the beginning, Private Division was the publisher we wanted to work with on our new game. Their track record and global expertise gives us all the confidence to create a sweeping new action-adventure game that we can't wait to share more about in the future.\" \nTake-Two Interactive chief strategy officer and Private Division head Micahel Worosz says you'd be hard-pressed to find a studio with more iconic hits over the past 30 years than Game Freak, addding, \"We're ready to help Game Freak unleash their potential and we're honored to be the first Western publisher to work alongside this exceptionally talented and proven team to bring a bold new IP to market.\" \nGame Freak was founded in 1989 and is best known for developing the majority of mainline Pokémon entries across various Nintendo consoles. Its most recent Pokémon release was last year's Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. It has, however, released non-Pokémon games throughout its history, including this year's Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On! on iOS and macOS devices. \nPrivate Division was founded in 2017 as a third publishing label within Take-Two Interactive. Notable titles published by Private Division include Hades, The Outer Worlds, Kerbal Space Program 2, Rollerdrome, OlliOlli World, and more. \nAre you excited for a new IP from Game Freak?

Join us today Friday on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central as we kick of the adventure, which will continue each week until we roll credits. We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel (or you can watch the videos in the above playlist). \nBanjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it? Let's find out.\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, alongside Kyle Hilliard as we explore one of the Xbox 360's biggest hidden gems to see whether it holds up or falls apart like a poorly constructed doohickey. \nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

Harmony: The Fall of Reverie is a choice-driven adventure starring Polly, a woman who returns home to find her missing mother. It's here Polly discovers she has clairvoyant abilities connecting her to a strange dimension called Reverie. While visiting this world, Polly becomes Harmony and encounters six powerful god-like beings called Aspirations, which serve as the hearts of humanity such as Glory, Power, Chaos, Bliss, and Truth. \n\n\nPolly must restore the balance between Reverie and our world and decide which Aspiration ultimately inspires humanity by making decisions represented by a system called the Augural. This web presents a multitude of scenes players will jump between that reveal possible futures that, in turn, unlock additional story branches. Polly does this by collecting crystals given to her with each choice and character bond she makes, which are used to unlock nodes on the Augural that alter the course of the story. \nHarmony: The Fall of Reverie sports a vibrantly illustrated art direction and a soundtrack by award-winning composer Lena Raine. You can try it out early thanks to a limited-time Steam demo launching today that will be available until May 21.\nFor more on Don't Nod, check out its other new title, Banishers: Ghosts of a New Eden, which also launches later this year.",

During an appearance this morning on Kinda Funny Games’ Xcast, the executive opened up about Redfall’s launch woes.   \n“There’s nothing that’s more difficult for me than disappointing the Xbox community,” says Spencer when asked about his reaction to the game's poor reception. “...just to kind of watch the community lose confidence, be disappointed, I’m disappointed, I’m upset with myself…”\nSpencer continues by touching on the criticism of Redfall launching at 30 frames per second and how it goes against Microsoft’s original claim of first-party Xbox Series X/S titles always running at 60 FPS. “That was kind of our punch in the chin, rightfully, a couple of weeks ago,” he says …",

But its failure is a disappointing situation for several reasons. Developer Arkane is one of my favorite studios, so it sucks to see it fumble the ball. My admiration for the team made me genuinely excited for Redfall, which I still think is a cool premise on paper, making it a tough pill to swallow in practice. But the most upsetting element is seeing a studio fall short after trying something new and getting criticized for even attempting it.  \nThere are many valid reasons to drive a stake through Redfall’s heart, but the most worrying sentiment I’ve seen is Arkane should have never made it and given us Dishonored 3 or Prey 2 instead. That’s an understandable wish; I…",

This new co-op brawler is coming this summer and will revitalize the dormant series in a new tag-team-focused adventure.\nSet in New York City after it’s been destroyed by nuclear war, Billy and Jimmy must take back what remains from the violent gangs that have since taken over. They won’t be doing it alone, though. The game features 13 playable characters, including Marian, the brothers’ old love interest, who now packs a pistol to blast threats from afar, and newcomer Uncle Matin, a tank-like fighter with a riot shield. \n\n\nAccording to a press release, Double Dragon Gaiden boasts “seamless tag team abilities and a multitude of strategies for devastating combos, defensive and offensive moves.” Solo players can swap characters on the fly to switch between their individual skills, such as the offense-focused Jimmy and more defensive Billy. The game supports two-player local co-op at launch (online co-op is coming in a post-launch update). \nDouble Dragon Gaiden tasks players with toppling four gang leaders and features a unique dynamic mission select system. Missions can be tackled in any order, and this selection affects their length, difficulty, and the number of enemies that appear. Earning cash unlocks powerful special movies that instantly knock out enemies, and you can also obtain crowd control moves that can wipe out multiple foes. Other gameplay options include an adjustable difficulty, permadeath and infinite modes, and unlockable bonuses. \nDouble Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons is being developed by Secret Base and published by Modus Games.

The film tells the true story of Jann Mardenborough, a British professional race car driver who began his career by winning GT Academy, a European televised contest that pitted the best Gran Turismo players against each other for a chance to earn an actual racing career with Nissan. The film follows the teenage Mardenborough's ascension from, as the poster below puts it, gamer to racer and all the trials that come with it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            \n\n\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMardenorough is portrayed by Archie Madekwe and the film also stars David Harbour, Orlando Bloom, and Djimon Hounsou.

          "description": "Redfall is now available for players worldwide, but unfortunately, I’ve only been playing for a few days and cannot provide a full review yet.\nWriting this Redfall review-in-progress is painful because Arkane Studios is one of my favorite game developers, and its new game is largely disappointing. While the open world is beautifully sculpted with intriguing vistas, it’s weirdly empty, often implying that the harbor town’s vampire usurpers invaded during the offseason. \nAs a whole, Redfall’s gameplay is unbalanced. Several puzzling decisions, like a lack of stealth takedowns or the inability to pause the game in single-player mode, are far from what I’d expect from an Arkane game. Rampant technical issues hinder the brighter moments of the experience, including frequent server crashes, inputs failing to work, NPCs and enemies spawning duplicate versions of themselves, and one very frustrating bug which prevents me from closing the world map and main menu in cooperative play. \nOn a positive note, I like the four launch protagonists, each with unique skills you can upgrade via a straightforward-but-effective skill tree. Also, a handful of weapons are neat, like the heavy-hitting stake launcher or ultra-violet raygun that turns vampires to stone. A few locations, like a deranged scientist’s mansion, a cliffside lighthouse, and a hangar repurposed as a prison quarter, provide enough challenge to incentivize intelligent pathfinding. Unfortunately, most locations and enemy placements feel haphazardly designed – certainly a byproduct of creating two open-world maps. \nHowever, my evaluation may change in the coming days. I’ve completed roughly 50 percent of the game and its first story arc, but I’ve only played for a few days and have more content to see.\n\nWe’re reviewing Redfall on PC. Here are our computer specs: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090, AMD Ryzen 9 5950X 16-Core Processor, 64GB RAM",

Today’s update, which is now live, is only stated as being “performance improvements for non-raytraced rendering\" in the patch notes. \nThat doesn’t seem like the most helpful update on the surface, but it's worth noting that the multiple improvements coming to the console versions, which are listed below, have already been implemented on PC:\nMultiple crashes fixed across PlayStation and Xbox Series X/S and various areas of the game.\nFixed crashes that were tied to skipping cinematics.\nPerformance improvements across PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.\nFixed an issue with dynamic cloth inside the Mantis\nFixed various rendering issues.\nFixed an issue with registered Nekko colors not saving.\nFixed an issue with registered Nekko disappearing from the stable.\nFixed issues with cinematic dialogue overlapping.\nFixed various collision issues.\nFixed an issue with enemy A.I. remaining in T Pose during photo mode.\nFixed a freeze that occasionally occurred while talking to Doma.\nFixed a bug where the BD-oil VFX did not properly render.\nFixed an issue where players were getting stuck inside the Chamber of Duality if you didn’t save after leaving the chamber and die. \nHopefully, today’s PC patch does some significant help, but if not, Respawn, at least has other updates in the works.

Movie continues to be a massive success and became the first film of 2023 to leap past $1 billion at the global box office. \nThe film achieved this milestone on Sunday, less than a month after its U.S. premiere on April 5. According to Variety, the film has grossed $490 million in North America and $532 million internationally, adding up to rough total of over $1 billion. Despite a tepid critical reception, Illumination’s adaptation of Nintendo’s flagship franchise has already become the highest-grossing video game film ever, the highest opening weekend, and the top-grossing film of 2023 so far.  \nThe Super Mario Bros.

Story Kitchen is helmed by names such as Dmitri Johnson (co-producer of the Sonic the Hedgehog films), John Wick creator/writer Derek Kolstad, and APA agent Mike Goldberg. There’s currently no other details about what the series will entail, such as the cast or a premiere date. \n“The most important thing in Vampire Survivors is the story, so it's a dream come true to see what started as a little indie game I made on my weekends come to life as an animated TV show! It’s also great to be partnering up with such experienced and talented people to make the show. I do wonder if they've realised that there isn't a single vampire in Vampire Survivors, though,” says Luca Galante, founder of poncle in a press release.\nIf you're tilting your head wondering how a pixelated arcade game can be translated into a show, it's worth nothing that Vampire Survivors has been brought to life in animated form before. Its two expansions – Legacy of the Moonspell and the recently launched Tides of the Foscari – both featured slick animated trailers, so those could be reference points for how this series may potentially appear. \nVampire Survivors has been on quite a roll since it launched to widespread acclaim last year, scooping up several end-of-year awards and walking away with a couple of BAFTA trophies this year, including winning Best Game.

          "description": "Bloober Team and Anshar Studios have released a new Layers of Fear gameplay trailer to demonstrate the game's performance in Unreal Engine 5. \nLayers of Fear combines the experience of the first two Layers of Fear games, as well as both games' DLC, into one single game. It will also feature a new chapter called \"The Final Note\" that gives players an alternate perspective on the first game's story. Layers of Fear is being developed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. You can check out the game's performance, as well as its new mechanics and visual enhancements, in the gameplay trailer below: \n\n\nLayers of Fear will support Ray-Tracing, HDR, and 4K resolution. Plus, it uses Lumen global illumination (you might recognize the word \"Lumen\" from Epic Games' Unreal Engine showcase back in 2021), Niagara visual effects \"to create particle effects in real time\" and Action System Controls \"to improve the development process and optimization of all gameplay mechanics,\" according to a press release. \n\"Creating games with Unreal Engine 5 is a great opportunity for the whole team, as it means our game development process can skyrocket in quality,\" Anshar Studios lead programmer Tomasz Bilnicki writes in the press release. \"It has an incredible power when it comes to the implementation of dynamic lighting, shadows, and potentially beautiful worlds for players to explore. We hope that – thanks to the engine – we'll provide players with the unique, immersive, visually stunning, and atmospheric experience in graphical fidelity.\" \nLayers of Fear will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in June. \nFor more, read Game Informer's review of Layers of Fear and then check out our thoughts on its sequel in our Layers of Fear 2 review. \nAre you picking up Layers of Fear this June?

Now, less than six months later, we have a release date, and it's probably sooner than you expected. \nThat's because Armored Core VI hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on August 25, 2023. From Software announced this out of nowhere with a surprise trailer today that runs more than three minutes long. It features plenty of flashy mech action and some teases about what might be going on in this beautiful (but distraught) sci-fi world. \nCheck out the new Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon is a drastic departure from the fantasy worlds of late that From Software has been creating, but this still looks decidedly From Software. And we can't wait to check it out in just a few months. \nThe trailer also reveals what you can expect from the game's various digital editions and the special Collector's Edition – check them both out below: \n\nArmored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon launches on August 25, 2023.

The launch trailer itself is more of what you'd expect from a Redfall trailer – vampires, cooperative action, special abilities, and plenty of FPS gunplay. Check it out for yourself below: \n\n\nFor more about Redfall, read about how the game will only launch with a Quality Mode (although a 60 FPS Performance Mode is planned for post-launch), and then read about how Microsoft canceled a PlayStation 5 version of Redfall after it acquired Arkane parent company Bethesda.

          "description": "Microsoft has released its financial results for Q3 of its 2023 Fiscal Year, which consists of roughly January through March of this year. In it, the company revealed that Xbox hardware revenue is down but its Xbox content and services revenue is slightly up thanks to Xbox Game Pass subscription growth. \nMore specifically, Xbox hardware is down 30% and Xbox content and services is up 3%. Overall, Xbox's gaming revenue is down 4%, though. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that the company set third-quarter records for monthly active users and devices, and that Xbox's gaming subscriptions (see: Game Pass) reached almost $1 billion this quarter. Despite this growth and revenue, though, Microsoft did not release new numbers regarding Game Pass subscription count – the latest count was 25 million in January 2022. \nAs for the dip in hardware revenue, Microsoft says the decline comes from the comparison of this quarter this year to the same quarter in the previous fiscal year, which gained a boost thanks to increased console supply. \nHere are some other numbers from Microsoft's financial results: \nRevenue was $52.9 billion, an increase of 7% (or 10% in constant currency)\nOperating income was $22.4 billion, an increase of 10% (or 15% in constant currency)\nNet income was $18.3 billion, an increase of 9% (or 14% in constant currency)\nXbox hardware revenue is down 30%\nXbox content and services revenue is up 3%\nOverall, Xbox gaming revenue is down 4%\nThese results arrived yesterday, shortly before the Competition and Markets Authority, a U.K. regulatory agency that serves the same purpose as the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., blocked Microsoft's $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard today. You can read more about that here. \nWhat do you think Xbox needs to do to increase Xbox hardware revenue? Let us know in the comments below!",
