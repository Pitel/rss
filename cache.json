WrestleQuest enters the ring with a deadly combo of late-'80s wrestling nostalgia and mid-'90s JRPG mechanics, celebrating both while not quite managing to deliver the three-count at the end. However, if you grew up in those very specific eras, you should find enough here to power through to the championship fight.\nMega Cat Studio’s latest offering builds a fascinating world right from the start. The populace of a children’s toy box has become obsessed with professional wrestling, idolising the likes of Macho Man Randy Savage and Jake the Snake. Life in the toy box revolves around wrestling and every conflict is settled in the ring with flashy moves and high-stakes action.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Punching up.\nNintendo’s Punch-Out!! was one of the most iconic arcade and console fixtures of the early '80s, migrating from coin-op to the NES, where it was remoulded as Mike Tyson’s Punch-Out!! and bestowed a Rocky-esque narrative around up-and-coming challenger Little Mac. Since Super Punch Out!! and the Wii’s original entry, however, it’s a series that, in stark contrast to its emphasis on fast footwork, has slouched for modern movement. And, with Nintendo reluctant to step back into the ring, Argentina’s Purple Tree Studio is now fixing to become the new victor of an undernourished franchise.\nThunder Ray’s musculature is cut and framed entirely around the Punch-Out!! formula, to the point that anyone claiming Nintendo’s cease-and-desist manoeuvres are overly aggressive might want to reconsider their stance; they're still a far cry from toppling Capcom from the shutdown podium. There is little in the way of modern bonuses or extra modes here, just three difficulty settings to work through that save your progress and allow you to go back and revisit previously felled challengers. This works well if you’re struggling on a higher difficulty, allowing you to drop back to Rookie settings, for example, to learn the patterns more effectively.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It wasn't entirely clear what OU was going to be at that point, other than a sort-of-puzzle game about an amnesiac boy who'd found himself in a fantastical world of picturebook pages, and even when Alicia Haddick played it for herself at Bitsummit proper the following year, OU still had a strong, impenetrable sense of ambiguity about it.  \nBut its striking art and rustic guitar soundtrack have stuck in my mind ever since, and finally, OU is now out in the wild. I've only played about two hours of it so far, but it's clear there's still a lot more to discover within its dreamy little vignettes. It's one of those games that's designed to be played multiple times to get the full extent of the story, and I've just hit the first of those Nier Automata-esque restarts. Honestly, I'm not quite sure what to think of it yet, but one thing is certain: I can't get it out of my head.\nRead more",

I wasn't quite expecting to enjoy The Man Came Around, then, as it's about a group of desperate people trying to cross the border to escape their authoritarian government. In Winter, no less.\nIt's actually rather light in practice, although not in a flippant or trivialising way. The message is clearly that these things are serious and our sympathies should be, well, basic concern for the wellbeing of other people. But it's not as miserable to play as games with such serious themes often are. The premise is serious, but the act of playing it is not. I'd call it \"diverting\" rather than \"entertaining\", but the bottom line is there's a good afternoon or two in there for you.\nRead more",

I spent most of my hour-long demo session steadily working my way through its extensive tutorial, as I have not, in fact, played Cities: Skylines before now - although I can at least confirm that its tutorial is very newbie-friendly, and that I now feel more prepared to give it a go properly when it comes out in full on October 24th.\nBut the thing that really impressed me was just the sheer scope of its playable spaces. We've known since the end of July that its maps are roughly 5x bigger than those in the first game, and when I saw Colossal Order's Maps & Themes video, I thought, 'Yes, those sure look enormous!'

In this foetid offering from Argentinian devs Andrés Borghi and Tobías Rusjan of Saibot Studios, you play a young woman, Julia, who is visiting her film-maker ex-boyfriend to drop off their old apartment key. Julia’s having a hard time getting over the break-up, but she’s clearly doing better than her ex: his apartment is full of broken glass, anomalous red gloop and creepy occult books. \r\n\n\r\nThe game’s twist is that it’s two visual styles thrust into the same frame. On the one hand, you'll explore an 8-bit world of unpleasantly bright colours, finding and combining objects adventure-game-style. I say adventure-game-style, because this is a bit more energetic than most adventure games – you can equip and swing a wrench, and there’s a run button. On the other hand, well.

A quick reminder of the rules: I can only acquire new ships by commandeering them, with no planetary landings permitted, which also means that I can't just shuffle between ships at whim after adding them to my hangar. It's possible the game contains an orbital shipyard of some kind - if you've found one, don't spoil! - but at the time of writing, any vessel I abandon is essentially gone for good. \r\n\n\r\nMy first trophy as greenhorn orbital bandit Mary Read was a UC Transpo, which isn't so much a spaceship as a shoebox with toilet roll tubes and detergent bottles glued to the outside, its ordnance limited to a single laser. I began my second leg confidently expecting to spend many hours in this Fisher Price starmobile, vainly searching for a wounded battlecruiser or an abandoned solar yacht or some other, more capable vessel accessible to a space pirate of extremely modest means. This is going to be Jalopy: Galactic Edition, I said to myself. Imagine my shock (and slight disappointment) when I jumped to the very next planet and proceeded to comprehensively ding over a Crimson Fleet Spectre.\r\n\n \nRead more",

In truth, I was surprised (and somewhat saddened) by some of the comments we received around our Baldur's Gate 3 coverage. If you missed them, they were mostly in the vein of saying our increased volume of BG3-related posts felt like \"spam\", harking back to when we (and the internet at large) all went similarly bananas over Elden Ring last year. I know it can sometimes seem like writing about these games - particularly on RPS - feels like we're somehow neglecting everything else going on in PC gaming. But the truth is a little more complicated than that, so I wanted to take some time to talk a bit about this in this month's Letter From The Editor, because there are a number of reasons why this happens - and will probably continue to happen more generally as websites fight for survival.\nRead more",

In the case of Affogato, it’s three of my favourite types of games mashed together: it’s Coffee Talk by way of Persona by way of any card-based tower defence game – only here it’s sort of \"reverse tower defence\", as the game's Steam page is keen to point out. It's your own card units that are the ones moving along pre-defined tracks wreaking havoc on stationary enemies, not the other way around. Maybe tower assault would be a better term, but that's by the by. Served with a dollop of anime froth on the top, Affogato should be my exact cuppa joe.

Granted, I'm a thirty-something in a country with a years-long housing crisis, so even the Baker House in Resident Evil 7 is of \"I think I could just about afford that one day\" status. But it comes to something when a 70s depresso-capsule at the bottom of the sea has more square footage and storage space than I do.\nUnder The Waves (which got patched today, and not before time because I've had one fatal error crash per play session since it came out last week so far) is about a deep sea diver called Stan, who is living and working at the bottom of a big wet metaphor for grief. You will know this because a) its Steam page says this up front, and b) it's not super subtle (this game is published by Quantic Dream). But, as newsman Edwin pointed out to me today, when was the last time the sea wasn't a metaphor for grief? It's never a metaphor for enjoying a nice raspberry ripple ice cream. And despite Stan making reference to \"what [he's] been through\" half an hour in, I think it does a great job with its chthonic sadness. You float about in your tiny little sub in a great misty darkness, listen to the extremely melancholy music, and you start thinking about sad stuff in your own life. But you get into Stan's capsule living area and you think \"this guy has a carpet and a book nook, what the hell?\"\nRead more",

It's the company's first new IP in almost 30 years (a claim that contains in it an inherent threat for Starfield 2), and though Bethesda has copied some of their own homework for some themes and factions, Starfield is indeed a spacefaring adventure of epic scale and sometimes surprising beauty. It's this scale that makes Starfield feel unfortunately small and empty, a place that still has those fun little Bethesda side quests that escalate into something huge and absurd, but that can also swallow them whole in its cold, star-scattered grandeur.\nRead more",

Or at least it will be, once you've played 100 hours of Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, an RPG from Pathfinder developer Owlcat in which you can buy planets, configure your genocidal Dark Eldar friend to strike ten times a turn, and gaze on ruefully as a demon explodes out of your Psyker's head. \r\n\n\r\nAn immediate and shameful disclaimer: I can't match Nic Reuben's deep knowledge of the 40K tabletop universe, which saw him ruminating upon the mysteries of the Koronus Expanse back in 2022, while holding Owlcat's feet to the fire over the absence of space dwarves. The nearest I got to playing 40K as a lad was its Battlefleet Gothic spin-off (which none of my friends were interested in, so when I say \"playing\", I mean that I sat in a room staring glumly at some unpainted Lunar-class Cruisers while other kids went out and climbed trees). The framing I'm working with instead, based on an hour of hands-off Rogue Trader gameplay, is that it's sort of Warhammer Mass Effect, but with XCOM-style turn- and grid-based combat, and while there are opportunities to be a compassionate hero, you fundamentally only have the option of playing Renegade.

Rather, this is a game that's designed to unfurl slowly, bit by bit, over the course of several hours, and before we begin, developer Frame Break's CEO Joakim Hedström tells me they've shortened the game's opening sequence for this particular demo, just so they can get players right into the thick of things as quickly as possible. \nBut even on this whistlestop tour, there's plenty to dig into and delight in here - not least its gloriously bright and inviting colour palette (take that, Todd). I got to sample its farming, its wonderfully weighty mech exploration, and even indulge in a little bit of, well, powerwashing. Yep, PowerWash Simulator's influence was well and truly felt at this year's Gamescom, and I'm so very here for it.\nRead more",

Xbox Cloud Gaming will let you play Starfield on the Steam Deck at a steady (enough) 30fps, by streaming the game from Microsoft's cloud network direct to your screen - no Proton GE or Lutris launcher required.

The spark this time is little-known science fiction adventure Starfield, which I believe we've reported on before. The game has a few obvious foibles - in my experience as a space pirate, NPCs sometimes struggle to navigate their surroundings, and then there are those stark disconnects between planetary surfaces and orbital space. Hiccups such as these have led a few players to wonder whether the game might work better using different technology, and in particular, the newer versions of Epic's ubiquitous Unreal Engine. Isn't Bethesda's proprietary Creation Engine, which the company have been updating since 2011, getting a little long in the tooth?\nYou'll find a lot of the discussion below this post from Digital Foundry boffin John Linneman on Twxter, which has attracted both gloating PlayStation fans (remember, Starfield is Xbox-only in console land) and a number of thoughtful replies from some fairly senior game developers. This conversation goes back a fair way, of course - people have been ragging on Bethesda for using \"the same engine\" for years. And there's a definite air of world-weariness to some of the developer responses.\r\n \nRead more",

You must learn to see past the visual overkill of a swing that would surely fell a skyscraper, registering only the effects on your poise and health bar. It's a learning curve, for sure, and that makes the modding of mechs from Armored Core 6: Fires Of Rubicon into Elden Ring a little more than the usual act of mischievous fanservice. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "You may have seen that Alice Bee has started a \"land on every planet\" run of Bethesda's Starfield. By total coincidence - I promise you it's accidental, I was so pleased - I've been working on a \"land on no planets\" run of Starfield. The reasoning for this is as follows: people say that outer space is the worst part of the game, because it's just an irritating interval between the maps where the majority of quests, loot, intrigues, etc are found. It's a fast travel loading screen you can fly about in. But what if you double-down on the space stuff? \r\n\n\r\nWhat if you never descend from orbit, not even to repair, modify or upgrade your ship and offload inventory? What if, rather than buying new ships or building them, you progress exclusively by boarding other captains and making off with ship and cargo? How well does Starfield scrub up as a thoroughbred space sim that leans towards bloodthirsty piracy? Here to answer these questions is Mary Read, my custom character and budding astral freebooter. She's named for her distant ancestor, the legendary 18th century English buccaneer Mary Read. She's had a crack at life on shore, setting foot most recently on Earth's Moon, but from this point on, her fate and fortune lies amid the stars. Arrr!\r\n\n \nRead more",

The new title is a sokoban-style puzzle game, which is to say, it's broadly about shoving crates around, but as the name suggests, Void Stranger has bigger ambitions than helping you while away five minutes over lunch. It's a game of faith, amnesia and devilry, which reportedly portions out its secrets across multiple playthroughs. Here's a trailer.\n Read more",

For me, the final act of BG3 is the act when all my nonsensing in the rest of the game paid off. The part where it turned out it did matter that I spent a painstaking hour separating and killing a bunch of guards in a mine, so I could save the gnomes trapped in a cave-in.

I'm especially grateful when us single player preferers get a knowing nod of acknowledgement in fighting games, too, which are so naturally geared toward pitting your skills against other human beings that anything involving playing against the AI is often either an afterthought or so threadbare that you can't help but feel like you're missing the point. \nBut that's still, for my sins, how I like to consume fighting games when I occasionally play them - which isn't often, I'll admit, for exactly the reasons described above - and so when I sat down for my Mortal Kombat 1 demo session at Gamescom this year, I was pleased to see not just a very slick story mode in attendance, but also a new single player challenge mode called Invasions that publishers Warner Bros described as \"a giant interactive board game\" that \"lent into action RPG\" territory. Its numerous node-based missions looked substantial based on what I played, and the idea of applying a seasonal service model to it, endlessly rotating in new locations and missions every so often - a whole different Invasion, so to speak - is actually something I'd be very much behind. It, that is, I was a) good at Mortal Kombat, and b) the missions I played during my demo weren't quite so… err… boring.\nRead more",

I’ve tried the Starfield mod and it works rather nicely, granting a visible quality boost on RTX graphics cards while equalling FSR’s ability to smooth out Starfield’s sometimes-tricky performance. Unfortunately (and largely by association), it’s also been dragged into a spot of nasty business, one involving a separate mod for DLSS 3 frame generation and PureDark’s application of DRM.\nRead more",

And, god, I hated it so much.”\nIt’s weird, in fact, that Gaider wound up working on Baldur’s Gate II at all - let alone that he became synonymous with Dragon Age and romanceable companions afterwards. At 27 years old, he ran a hotel in Edmonton, Alberta - the same city where, unbeknownst to him, Bioware was busy making its name. Once it came time to make a sequel to Baldur’s Gate, Bioware cast around for local writers, and a friend recommended Gaider, who had played D&D in the ‘80s before it fell out of fashion.\nRead more",

Well, at the risk of empirically demonstrating that romance is dead, it turns out all that might have been down to a technical problem.

This segmented approach has prompted many unflattering comparisons with No Man's Sky, in which you can manually pilot through the atmosphere. \r\n\n\r\nPlayers and critics were similarly disappointed by the apparent inability to manually fly between planets in different orbits - instead, the game invites you to pick a destination from your star map or while using your spaceship's scanner HUD, with the journey condensed to a cutscene, again. Well, I bring news on this front. You can actually fly \"to\" and perhaps even \"between\" planets in Starfield. But there are some buts. Buts of astronomical dimensions. Onward!\r\n\n \nRead more",

Taken as 'pure' interactive fiction, it'd be shorter and simpler, but might allow its premise, atmosphere, and intriguing world to shine the way they ought to.\r\n\n\r\nThe premise actually takes some explaining. Jules Verne himself takes the place of Aronnax, the protagonist of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Seas, and instead of mere hermitry, his new submarine home/prison is devoted to a guerrilla war against The Nation, a Prussian-ish empire you might be able to stop using a techno-magical gubbins that allows you to edit reality.

          "description": "Earlier this week I attended a hands-off preview for Owlcat's forthcoming CRPG Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, which is shaping up nicely, inasmuch as there's anything \"nice\" about a Warhammer 40,000 game. Rogue Trader is a party-based affair in which you play a sort of Warhammer East India Company, tasked with flipping outlying worlds to the Imperium. In order to carry out this goal, you're granted a lot more individual license than most human residents of the 40K universe. You can, for instance, recruit ungodly xenos to your grimdark troupe, operate a private armada, and even colonise planets and turn them into your own personal piggybank. Just watch you don't push the whole \"heresy\" thing too far.\r\n\n\r\nI'll have more for you on the subject soonish, but here's an interesting advance snippet from my interview with Owlcat's creative director Alexander Mishulin, in which we discussed what really distinguishes a CRPG from other kinds of role-playing game. According to Mishulin, it's all about designing for choices with consequences that genuinely run the entire length of the game, without (somehow) getting lost in the narrative undergrowth.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Having spent around 45 minutes in a three-player Payday 3 sesh at this year's Gamescom, I can confirm it's very… Payday. You slap on some masks, choose your loadout, then get to robbing banks or stealing things from crates. Often, it ends in absolute chaos as you mow through waves of coppers and rush to a getaway van. The number three might not signal a sweeping change to the formula, then, but that's arguably a good thing. It's a better-looking version of its predecessors that doesn't lose sight of the co-op silliness.\nRead more",

          "description": "The Leftfield Collection is always one of my favourite areas to visit at EGX. Partly because it's regularly stuffed full of interesting indie games with often very neat and unusual controllers attached to them (which in previous years have included actual paper shredders and full-on Morse code machines), but also because they're often so new and hot off the digital presses that I've never even heard of them before, which is very, very exciting to me. It's a great little space to discover what will be the next talking points of video games-to-be, and this year's line-up looks to be no exception. Here are all the games you'll be able to play at this year's Leftfield Collection at EGX 2023.   \nRead more",

I felt it was so close, too close, to Bloodborne in everything from the cadence of the Chalamet puppet's jog, to the \"duhhnng\" noise of pickups, and the gothic sheen of its streets. At the time I thought it was a bit of a duff pretender, honestly.\nBut a good chunk of time with it at this year's Gamescom has swivelled my head back in its direction. Having clacked through some dingy streets, fired blue gloop from my arm, and fought the literal King Of Puppets, I've come to realise it has the potential to be a magnificent Soulslike in its own right.\nRead more",

          "description": "A quick heads-up for those of you hopping aboard the Starfield interstellar express today: there is a non-zero possibility that one of the game's elevators has a shark in it. That's according to Bethesda's head of publishing Pete Hines, who encountered the displaced piscine trouble-maker while playing the game before release. He's \"almost positive\" the shark isn't there any more - and just like that, my understanding of Starfield has been transformed. This isn't a 150 hour RPG treadmill of resource extraction, artefact investigation and base-building, wherein you give spaceship tours and put +5% on your accuracy, or what-have-you. It's an extremely slowburn horror game, with every innocent elevator potentially housing a Great White jumpscare. All of which, Hines feels, is true to how Bethesda \"embraces chaos\" in their games, though he does feel the company's popular association with jank and bugs isn't \"particularly fair\".\nRead more",

It’s a chunky lad compared to its peers, weighing 854g and packing an 8.8in display, but promises a bigger battery and – most interestingly – a pair of Nintendo Switch-style detachable controllers.\r\n\n\r\nThese are partly intended to simply give your wrists a rest, setting the Legion Go down on its (also Switch-esque) integrated kickstand while you play with the loose controllers. The right pad, mind, also includes an optical sensor on the bottom, so you can swish it around a desk like a vertical mouse. Potentially a difference-maker for FPS games? We won’t need to wait long to find out, as the Legion Go is launching on October 31st. It’ll cost a surprisingly un-spooky £699 / $699.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Not because of nostalgia for Final Fantasy 7, though I have fond memories of that game. Rather, it was because I have seen virtually this exact same game on mobile devices for the past seven years now.\nDespite what Square Enix’s frankly confusing marketing might leave you to believe, Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis is just a gacha game. Calling it “another possibility for a remake” maybe isn’t untrue, but it's a bit misleading.

Each successive quality after Normal increases the bonus you get from the higher tier quality. Uncommon will grant a 30% bonus, Rare a 60% bonus, Epic a 90% bonus, and Legendary a 150% bonus.\nThe intended goal of adding Quality to Factorio is to balance Horizontal versus Vertical growth in the core gameplay.

          "description": "Everything comes full circle as Jean-Claude Van Damme prepares to join the lineup of Mortal Kombat 1. The inspiration for Johnny Cage is now a skin for the character, and he's on display in a new trailer. Van Damme provided his likeness and voice for the skin, which lets him fire off quips with the klassic kast. \nAfter trading blows that make Bloodsport seem tame, Van Damme closes out the clip with a brutal finisher. It's only appropriate that said finisher is delivered to Johnny Cage. Quite the gruesome price to pay for a life in the copycat spotlight. The video is age-restricted on YouTube, so you'll need to click through to watch. \n[caption id=\"attachment_403105\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot via NetherRealm Studios[/caption]\nSplits Decision\nThe very existence of the Mortal Kombat series can be traced back to JCVD. Co-creator Ed Boon wanted a fighter with Van Damme at the center of it, but the action film star declined. Thus, the notoriously gory, original fighter that still has us all double-checking our spelling of combat was born.\nThe Jean-Claude Van Damme character skin for Johnny Cage will be available as part of the Kombat Pack. As previously detailed, you can get that pack in the Premium Edition and Kollector's Edition versions. Van Damme will be released alongside six new early access DLC characters, including Quan Chi, Ermac, Takeda Takahashi, Peacemaker, Omni-Man, and Homelander. There will also be five new Kameo Fighters, all of which will be available post-launch. The Van Damme skin will be usable at launch, so start practicing your splits now.\nMortal Kombat 1 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store on September 14, 2023.  \nThe post Jean-Claude Van Damme enters the ring in Mortal Kombat 1 trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

To celebrate, Nintendo is preparing to launch a truly contentious Splatfest — who among the members of Deep Cut would be the best leader? \nStarting at 5:00 p.m. PST / 8:00 p.m. EST on September 8 and extending through 5:00 p.m. PST / 8:00 p.m. EST on September 10, players must decide who would be the best leader: Shiver, Frye, or Big Man? It would seem as if the sides are evenly matched, at least based on the Twitter replies. “Who else is joining Team Big Man?” asked YouTuber Zack Scott, who received nearly 40 responses at the time of writing, all of which appealed for a different member of Deep Cut to take home the win. \nBut, it would appear some folks fear the possibility of the majority ignoring the prompt in favor of making this Splatfest more of a popularity contest. “Remember guys, the question isn't about who your favorite Deep Cut member is, it's about who would make for a better leader out of them,” said one user on Twitter. They go on to admit their preference for Big Man, while also admitting their opinion that none of them would make good leaders. And then you’ve got the users who make it no secret that they’re not a fan of any available option. “Worst possible theme they could've done,” said one user. \nIn any case, who are you rooting for in this anniversary Splatfest?

I was there when the Xbox 360 launched. It was a pretty exciting time when it came about. Then, the hardware issues started happening. This was commonly known as the “Red Ring of Death,” named because of the error code that was displayed on the light ring around the power button.\nThe issue was caused by components heating up then cooling off quickly, which would cause connectors within them to break. It apparently wasn’t caused specifically by the console reaching a high heat, but rather the rapid cooling afterward. Uh, wait. What were we talking about? Blocks?\nThe Xbox 360 Mega Building Kit has you construct the console itself, a controller, and a disc case for Halo 3. It even comes with a detachable hard drive. Isn’t that cute?\nIt’s interesting that this isn’t being done by Lego. No disrespect to Mega Bloks, but it’s hard to beat the prestige of the Lego brand. Nintendo had their NES immortalized, and Atari brought around a 2600 set.\nThe Microsoft Xbox 360 Collector MEGA Building Set is available for pre-order (if it isn’t sold out) for $149.99 USD.

Franchise fans will be familiar with this name, as he has worked on the music of a few series titles including Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and Sonic Heroes. He'll be assisted by Sonic Mania composer Tee Lopes, who has excitedly assured fans that Superstars will feature an even better soundtrack.\nSonic Superstars is scheduled to release on October 17 on Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.\nThe post Sega reveals new level music from Sonic Superstars appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "In an interview with GameSpot, World of Warcraft Game Director Ion Hazzikostas hinted that another old-world revamp of Azeroth is \"likely to happen\". The last time this happened was the 2010 WoW expansion Cataclysm. According to Hazzikostas, the development team would learn lessons from Cataclysm which got a lot of negative criticism for deleting parts of the 2004-era WoW that many players loved. The goal would be to use modern solutions to preserve currently existing pieces of the game.\n\"We are definitely open to it at some point,\" Hazzikostas told GameSpot. \"It is a shortcoming, if you take a step back and think about World of Warcraft as an ongoing living world, if we've kind of painted ourselves into a corner where we have all these iconic locations but we can't really use them because…",

          "description": "Once the hype around Starfield dies down a bit, discussion will once again turn to the next Elder Scrolls game. Nearly twelve years after Skyrim, the next installment is now finally said to be in the early stages of development. As such, Xbox head Phil Spencer has been asked whether the elusive RPG will be an Xbox exclusive.\nIn a recent interview with Bloomberg Technology, Spencer is asked a question about exclusivity. In particular, journalist Caroline Hyde is curious about what platforms The Elder Scrolls 6 may be on. Spencer answers by saying that the company looks at things \"on a case-by-case basis.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-yYmq35E3I&t=83s\nHe adds that Xbox wants to make sure that the games made by the studio are \"available in many different places.\" However, he specifically mentions the Xbox consoles, PC, and \"via cloud,\" with no mention of any other platforms.\nToo early to say, really\nIt kind of sounds like Spencer is circling the bit when it comes to The Elder Scrolls 6 and potential exclusivity. Consider that Starfield being an Xbox Series and PC game only seems to be working out nicely for the tech giant.\nAs such, it's not above the realm of possibility that Xbox may keep Skyrim's follow-up for its own platforms. However, we can't say for certain, but Spencer's response to the question does seem rather vague.\nAs for when it's actually coming out, speculations suggest it might be another five years until we see TES6. By that point, we'll be on the next generation of consoles anyway. Great. More money to spend.\nThe post Phil Spencer asked about Elder Scrolls 6 exclusivity, gives vague response appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Given the sheer length of time Mario has been around, it's not surprising that people are able to beat the original Super Mario Bros. in record time. Speedrunning is a huge part of the gaming community, and the iconic Nintendo game is close to having the perfect run.\nOver on YouTube, runner Niftski has set a new world record, beating Super Mario Bros. in just 4:54.631. Watching the challenge itself is quite spectacular, but if you're curious as to why they're so elated when they finish the game, it's due to how near-perfect the run was.\nhttps://youtu.be/Khu9BB2g4Ks\nYou see, according to Niftski, someone just needs to shave off 0.366 seconds (or 22 frames) for it to be the absolute fastest – the literal limit – anyone can beat the classic platformer. Until now, this time was deemed impossible for human hands. But now a \"new era\" has begun for the speedrunning community.\nHeart-pumping stuff\nAccording to GamesRadar, this particular run is impressive because of something called \"framerule.\" This is, as the report says, the \"hidden in-game timer that checks every 21 frames to see if you've completed a level.\"\nThere's a 45-minute breakdown of how this works from YouTuber Summoning Salt, if you're interested in learning more. Suffice it to say, Niftski's record sets a new bar for others who want that perfect speedrun.\nSpeedrun.com has validated this latest run, which puts it just 0.233 seconds ahead of second place. Things are only going to get tighter, and it's going to be interesting to see who can come along and essentially do a frame-perfect run of Mario.\nThe post Super Mario speedruns are close to perfection, as a new world record is achieved appeared first on Destructoid.",

Its punishing gameplay seems to entice the most sadistic of players, and updates continue to add to the world. Now, the most recent patch implements enough new stuff to match a Schwarzenegger flick.\nA recent video uploaded to the Rust/Facepunch YouTube channel gives a good idea of what you can expect the next time you log in. Among other things, the developer has now added an attack helicopter, which comes complete with a gunner seat. There's also a homing missile launcher to take down said helicopter, and also an armored hot air balloon because why not?\nhttps://youtu.be/gTKll4bk968\nOne other thing that's been included in this latest update is the weapon rack. As the name suggests, this gives you a handy place to store all those guns. And while you're at it, have some parachutes as well, which allow you to \"travel silently over long distances.\" More details about the new patch can be found on Steam.\nNot rusty yet\nIf you're a newcomer to Rust, you'll know how tough it is to make it through those first few days. When it's not the threat of starvation or the wildlife that's keen on gnawing your bones, it's the other players who are, quite frankly, trigger-happy.\nStill, it's worth it if you can thrive in this harsh environment. The game's been out for several years now – originally releasing to early access in 2013 – and Facepunch Studios seems only too keen to keep improving its survival IP.

Now it's almost ready to blast off outta there with Nicalis setting a PC launch date for October 3, 2023. Ira will be available for $19.99 on Steam, Epic Games Store, and GOG. \nIra puts players in the role of a girl named Yeon, who channels an ancient god's powers to battle the forces of Chaos. Korean studio ABShot is behind this one, which mixes anime-style art with bullet hell shooting and roguelike game design. You can see a sample in the PC release date trailer below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThN39v3hVEU\nBringing a bow to a laser fight\nIf you're a fan of the bullet hell brand of shooters popularized by developers like Toaplan and Cave, you'll be right at home in this colorful maze of lasers. In addition to godly powers, Yeon wields a bow in her quest to locate the scattered remnants of the Ira crystal. Over 150 different bows can be found throughout the game along with various active and passive power-ups. Some might say 150+ bows is overkill, but can you ever really have enough? There are 150 unique relics and 43 bow+relic combo synergies on top of that, and Yeon can summon five Apostles to perform ultimate skills and trigger passive perks. \nAs for the roguelike elements, Ira's six stages consist of procedurally generated maps and weapon drops come at random. Early Access feedback seems mostly positive on Steam, where folks have been providing feedback since August 31, 2021. We'll find out how the final version shapes up soon.  \nThe post Bullet hell roguelike Ira exits Early Access after 2 years this October appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s coming to Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 19, 2023.\nDo you remember Gargoyles? I caught the odd episode as a youngun and really enjoyed it, but I was more into watching Warner Bros cartoons. I thought about watching it when I was older, but everyone says the show takes a sudden and abrupt dive in quality at some point. I’m not sure why that bothers me, plenty of shows are good until they’re bad, but that doesn’t mean they’re not worthwhile.\nhttps://youtu.be/OYUJXoWh1yg?feature=shared\nThe Gargoyles game debuted in 1995 exclusively for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. It was fine. Some would define it as a game that doesn’t suck. I put it more in the camp of 1995’s Toy Story. It’s a licensed game, so you should set your expectations there, and you might be pleasantly surprised.\nUnlike Disney’s previous 16-bit re-releases, Gargoyles Remastered is getting a full art style update and soundtrack upgrade. It looks pretty good, but it’s obviously built over the old game and does some awkward things with perspective and animation. However, if you don’t like it, you can simply toggle it back to 16-bit mode.\nIt’s, uh, a bit of a weird choice for a remaster, but I welcome revisiting any, so bring it on.\nGargoyles Remastered is coming to Switch, PS4, Xbox One, and PC. It is scheduled to be released on October 19, 2023, for $14.99 USD. There will also be a physical version available via Limited Run Games.\nThe post Okay Sega Genesis game Gargoyles is getting remastered appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Since its reveal earlier this year, Mortal Kombat 1 has been unveiling its star-studded cast, one big name after another. Between J.K. Simmons reprising the role of Omni-Man from Invincible to John Cena being confirmed as Peacemaker, the roster is looking to be fierce in terms of both fighters and their actors. Warner Bros. Games revealed one more member of the cast in September: Megan Fox, of Transformers (2007) and Jennifer’s Body (2009) fame will be playing the role of Nitara in Mortal Kombat 1. \nFor those who haven’t touched a Mortal Kombat game since Deadly Alliance, Nitara is a winged vampire who hails from a realm called Vaeternus. It’d appear she’s up to the same old antics, as the Nitara trailer showcases the vampiress fighting against Ashrah, Kung Lao, and more. “I grew up playing Mortal Kombat and I can’t believe that I’m voicing a character in the new game,” said Fox. “It’s an honor to be a part of one of the greatest video game legacies of all time.“\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ah8VyRhiWiE\nAgain, Deadly Alliance was the last time fans of the series have been able to play as the winged vampire until now; though she was mentioned or referenced in Mortal Kombat: Deception, Mortal Kombat X and Mortal Kombat 11. Nitara was also present in the 2021 Mortal Kombat film, where she was played by Mel Jarnson.\nMortal Kombat 1 releases on September 19 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC. \nThe post Megan Fox joins Mortal Kombat 1 roster as Nitara appeared first on Destructoid.",

In the trailer, we get a glimpse of the characters, setting, and a piece of the story coming in the new series. Following the success of the original Castelvania animated series that ended in 2021, Castlevania: Nocturne continues the gory franchise with an all-new series that focuses on the origin story of Richter Belmont.\nThe trailer is a wild, bloody ride as you could imagine for Castlevania. It's also got a banger remix Nocturne Version of the song Divine Bloodlines.\nhttps://youtu.be/_afpwpbKPs0\nLive Digital World Premiere a day early\nEven though the official release date is September 28, you can check out Castlevania: Nocturne a little early. According to Netflix, fans can tune in to Netflix on Twitch on September 27 at 12 p.m. ET and watch a live stream of Castlevania: Nocturne a full day early.\nI've yet to watch the final season of Castlevania but this reminds me I need to do so ASAP. Hopefully Castlevania: Nocturne is as good as the original series, which sort of led to a bunch of quality animated series on Netflix.\nAlthough you should definitely check out the original Castlevania, it's not necessary to watch Castlevania: Nocturne. In fact, Netflix claims \"If you’ve never seen a Castlevania show, gaming adaptation, or anime before: start here.\"\n \nThe post Castlevania: Nocturne gets a new trailer with a killer new remix appeared first on Destructoid.",

At the same time, it’s a new chapter in a long legacy that surrounds the interplay between the original tabletop RPG and the video gaming hobby. It’s a strange truth that, even as a video game, Baldur’s Gate 3 has emerged as one of the most potent arguments in years for trying out the actual D&D game at a table.\nWhen I was a kid growing up in the ‘80s, playing D&D was not something you would readily admit to. Beyond the open ridicule you might face from your peers, it had a genuine chance to get you barred from some of your friends’ homes. No joke.

          "description": "Stray proved to be an unlikely phenomenon when it was released last July, and now the little kitty and its robotic pals are heading to the big screen. Publisher Annapurna has announced plans to develop an animated movie based on the hit indie game.\nPer Entertainment Weekly, Annapurna Animation, the company's new animated film division, is following up its debut feature, Nimona, with a film adaptation of the 2022 adventure game. It will be the first game in Annapurna Interactive’s roster of titles to get the cinematic treatment, and, according to the publisher, it won’t be the last. Annapurna has not revealed a director, cast, or release window for the Stray film. Annapurna Animation is led by former Disney Animation executives Robert Baird and Andrew Millstein. \n\"This is a game that's all about what makes us human, and there are no humans in it,\" Baird tells EW. \"It's a buddy comedy about a cat and a robot, and there's such a hilarious dynamic. So, there's comedy inherent in this, but there's not one human being in this movie. I think it's one of the reasons why the game was incredibly popular, that you are seeing the world through the point of view of an adorable cat. How did they pull that off, and how are we going to pull that off in the movie? We will, even though sometimes it feels impossible, but we know that's the essence of the game and the key to telling the story.\"\nStray was developed by French studio BlueTwelve. Taking place in a post-apocalyptic Earth devoid of humans, players control a cat who gets separated from its friends and sets out to find them. The cat's journey takes it through cities occupied by sentient robots, which it befriends along the way, namely a flying drone named B-12. Stray was among the most celebrated games of last year, winning Best Debut Indie at the Game Awards, and made its way to Xbox last month. You can read our review of Stray here. \n[Source: Entertainment Weekly]",

It will feature returning event game modes, new challenges, returning skins, and a brand new game mode called Hero Mastery. \nThe anniversary celebration starts later this month on September 19 and brings plenty of updates like hero tweaks, bug fixes, map changes, and more. But leading the celebration charge is the aforementioned Hero Mastery. Blizzard describes it as \"a new, single-player game mode that allows players to test their skills with individual heroes on custom courses\" and it's available starting today. Each hero can be played on three unique courses of increasing difficulty, and you can unlock up to five stars on …",

A new trailer revealed the game’s new presentation and an October release date.\nGargoyles Remastered takes the 1995 game and repaints it with a coat of new enhanced visuals more faithful to the series (and you can instantly toggle between the new look and the classic 16-bit graphics). It also includes the usual bells and whistles for remastered Disney games, such as an instant rewind, wide-screen presentation, and achievements. The original soundtrack has also been remastered. Check out the game's first trailer below. \n\n\nIf you’re a Gargoyles fan looking to fight evil as Goliath and his friends again, you can pick up Gargoyles Remastered on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on October 19.",

However, E3's overseer the ESA has announced this partnership will not continue.\nAccording to GameIndustry.biz, the ESA and ReedPop have come to a mutual decision to part ways. On top of that, E3 2024, which is still planned to take place, will not be held at its traditional venue, the Los Angeles Convention Center. This had been previously reported by the city itself. There’s no word on where E3 will be held, but the site reports that the ESA is also looking to completely reinvent the show in 2025. \n“We appreciate ReedPop’s partnership over the past 14 months and support their ongoing efforts to bring industry and fans together through their various events,” said ESA president and CEO Stanley Pierre-Louis in a statement to GameIndustry.biz. “While the reach of E3 remains unmatched in our industry, we are continuing to explore how we can evolve it to best serve the video game industry and are evaluating every aspect of the event, from format to location. We are committed to our role as a convenor for the industry and look forward to sharing news about E3 in the coming months.”\nReedPop had been tasked with revamping this year’s ill-fated E3 after the show had collapsed over the last few years due to the pandemic and waning interest from publishers/developers. The 2023 edition fell through after Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft declined to attend alongside publishers such as Ubisoft and Sega. The last in-person E3 was in 2019, and outside of the online-only 2021 event, every subsequent E3 has been completely canceled. Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest has filled the void since then. \n[Source: GameIndustry.biz]",

Nitara is making her long-awaited return, and it’s such a big homecoming that NetherRealm has enlisted actress Megan Fox to voice her.\nNitara is a vampire that made her debut in 2002’s Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance. She’s only been playable in a couple of entries, had a small cameo in Mortal Kombat 11, and appeared in the 2021 Mortal Kombat film. Despite having only a few appearances to her name, she’s endured as favorite among fans who grew up with the 2000s era, and she looks as deadly as ever in MK 1. \nMegan Fox brings Nitara to life, and you can get a sample of her performance in the trailer below. “I grew up playing Mortal Kombat and I can’t believe that I’m voicing a character in the new game,\" Fox says in a press release. \"It’s an honor to be a part of one of the greatest video game legacies of all time.” Given that Ronda Rousey voiced Sonya Blade in MK 11, it’s not surprising to see NetherRealm rope in another celebrity to perform one of its kombatants. \n\n\nMortal Kombat 1 launches on September 19 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.

As fans know, the best way to follow up a good TMNT project is to make a video game out of it, and that’s exactly what's happening next year. \nPublisher Outright Games, along with Paramount and Nickelodeon, have announced a new untitled TMNT game in development set within the Mutant Mayhem universe. It will feature the same striking visual design and follows a new story set months after the movie's events. There’s no word yet on if the film’s ensemble cast will reprise their roles.\nIn terms of gameplay, a press release only hints that the project involves “combining energetic ninja teamwork gameplay with a humorous narrative, players will take control of the Turtles as they interact with a host of memorable characters from the franchise and fight to save this stylized take on New York City from a new mutant threat.” Outright Games has experience working on games based on kid-friendly licenses, making titles based on Star Trek: Prodigy, How to Train Your Dragon, Paw Patrol, and Peppa Pig. \nThe TMNT: Mutant Mayhem game is targeting PC and consoles. It’s the latest project in what’s been quite a renaissance for the Turtles, especially in video games. The resurgence kicked off with last year’s well-received TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge, which recently got a big new expansion. The Cowabunga Collection bundled nearly every classic TMNT game into one package for a modern audience. A single-player action game based on the beloved TMNT: The Last Ronin graphic novel is also in the works.",

That game, Rugrats: Adventures in Gameland, doesn't just feature retro sensibilities – it's an actual all-new retro game built in 2023.

          "description": "The upcoming reimagining of Alone in the Dark is skipping Halloween this year. Instead of inviting players back to Derceto on October 25, the survival horror adventure will now arrive on January 16.\nIn a press release, developer Pieces Interactive offers a candid explanation for the move: it doesn’t want the game to compete with October’s heavy hitters like Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and another big horror game, Alan Wake 2. \n“Our intention is to avoid competing with the wake of Alan's epic release and to evade the dazzling skyline of cities adorned by the graceful swings of Spider-Man,\" Pieces writes. \"We aim to truly remain as Alone in the Dark as possible. To honor this, the spine-chilling horror game has been rescheduled to unveil its horrors on January 16th, 2024. This extension will serve a dual purpose: not only will it permit us to meticulously perfect the gaming experience, but it will also grant us the opportunity to fully immerse ourselves in the remarkable releases of October.”\nThe studio also released a new trailer starring David Harbour’s Edward Carnby, one of the game’s protagonists, showing off his performance and impressive facial capture. \n\n\nAlone in the Dark is a modernized revamp of the 1992 survival horror classic that stars actors Jodie Comer and David Harbour as protagonists Emily Hartwood and detective Edward Carnby, respectively. Players control one character to explore the haunted Derceto hospital to solve a sinister mystery, with both scenarios offering different story threads and moments. You can read our full preview of the game here. It will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

This new trailer reveals a fun twist on the game’s shooting mechanics and comes alongside word that there’s a demo now available on Steam. \nThe trailer is short, running less than a minute, but it showcases the game’s terrifying ambiance, throwback visual style, and zombie-like creatures that have seemingly infested the small 1990s Polish town Holstin is set in. It also highlights that parts of the game are playable as an isometric, third-person shooter like last year’s Signalis and as an over-the-shoulder third-person shooter like in Capcom’s recent Resident Evil remakes. \nCheck out the Holstin gameplay reveal trailer for yourself below: \n\n\n“A psychological survival horror game set in an eerie, isolated 90’s Polish town consumed by an ominous presence,” the Holstin Steam page reads. “You’ve come looking for answers, but everyone seems possessed by something foul. Explore the festering town, interrogate locals, and fight ungodly manifestations to get to the truth.” \nThere’s no release date in sight for Holstin, but you can try the game for yourself today through a demo available on Steam right now. \nHolstin is set to release one day on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.\nFor more scary games, read Game Informer’s list of the top 10 horror games to play right now, and then read our list of the top 25 horror games of all time after that.",

I’m roughly 23 hours in, so I still have many galaxies ahead of me, but read Game Informer’s Starfield review for in-depth thoughts on the overall package. With years of build-up and anticipation, I, like many Bethesda Game Studios fans, let my imagination run wild with what this new open world RPG could be. Now that I’ve played a decent chunk of it, it’s quite different from the studios’ Elder Scrolls and Fallout series in some ways. Those two franchises are significantly more open world than Starfield. In fact, Starfield feels more like a great sci-fi theme park with exciting points of interests rather than an open world adventure. But players looking for a replica space-based Fallout or Elder Scrolls adventure might …",

Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign. Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. \nAfter 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.\nJoin editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up. \nPart 1 - Surpr-iced! \nPart 2 - Bringing The Smoke\nWatch on Twitch!\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

This may require installing Apple’s Testflight app. You can find instructions on how to install games and how to play them on our documentation portal.\nWe truly appreciate your feedback. You can share your thoughts with the Testflight feedback feature, where you can attach screenshots and post detailed descriptions.
