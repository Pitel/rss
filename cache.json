          "description": "Keeping the Flame burning.\nA couple of years ago, a little puzzle game came to the Switch eShop called Dungeons of Dreadrock, which smartly mixed the vibe of 1980s first-person adventure games with simple puzzle mechanics. Though Dungeons of Dreadrock was enjoyable enough as a standalone experience, it was recently revealed that there will be a trilogy of Dreadrock games and the second entry has now arrived. Dungeons of Dreadrock 2 – The Dead King’s Secret doesn’t prove to be much of an improvement over its predecessor, but that’s hardly a bad thing given that it also nails everything that made the original special.\nIn a fun and rather interesting approach, Dungeons of Dreadrock 2 takes place at exactly the same time as its predecessor, this time placing you in the shoes of a sorceress and priestess of the Order of the Flame, who works in the shadows on a journey that is tightly related to the plot of the first game in various clever ways.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl stays largely faithful to the original series’ bleak yet inquisitive tone and propensity for technical problems, but there’s another, much smaller feature that it also brings back: silly titles for its lesser NPCs. All the major and side characters are, indeed, characters, but rather than leave inconsequential henchmen and roving bandits nameless, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 assigns Zone-merc handles to each and every one of them. Some try to sound badass, some might as well have been chosen by the owner panickedly looking around the room for something to name himself after, and all of them sound like they should be on the actor's wall in Toast of London.\nBecause your life partly depends on relieving slain foes of their belongings, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 encourages you to get up close and looty with these blokes, meaning you end up spending a lot of time reading goofy nicknames. I thought I’d pay tribute to the best ones I’ve seen so far, even if the majority of these honours will need to be given posthumously.\nRead more",

Besides, isn't every action game an action-RPG these days? Levelling-up has become an industry-wide syndrome. Go on, name an action game that doesn't have RPG-style elements. No wait, don't actually do that. I was being rhetorical. Read the rest of this post first.\r\n \nRead more",

I've never actually paid for one of these side-scrolling shoot 'em ups, except for all the countless coins I happily pumped into arcade machines as a child. To this day, if I see a rare glittering cabinet running one of these crunchy shmups, I will go ham for twenty or thirty minutes, and walk away satisfied that I have seen a lot of very good pixels. These games, I am convinced, were never really designed to be completed, but to be played exactly like this, as a coin-gobbling invitation to become a bandana-wearing sisyphus, a tiny Rambo pushing a bouncy, juddering tank up a hill occupied by cartoon nazis. You die a bunch and say: \"ah, that was good.\"\nSo what happens when you rearrange the molecules of this run and/or gun 'em up into an isometric turn-based strategy game? You get Metal Slug Tactics, an off-kilter nod to Into The Breach and other grid-based turn-takers, but secretly housing the aggressive notions of an unhinged pyromaniac. You still die a lot.

          "description": "I've been trying to work out if I'm keen on Soulframe only because I feel guilty about missing the boat with Warframe. I reviewed Digital Extremes' hit free-to-play shooter in 2013, back when people were still calling it a spiritual successor to the developer's boomerang-throwing action game Dark Sector. I didn't like Warframe much at the time. Think I gave it a 6/10. Warp forward a decade, and that 6/10 game has become a thriving live service phenomenon - fifteenth on the Steam Most Played charts at the time of writing, and profitable enough to spawn its own annual TennoCon expo. It's also become an intoxicating, confusing morass of dynastic sci-fantasy politicking and genre-shifting expansions, ranging from capital ship mechanics to questions of time travel, wrapped in layers of cosmetics that make Destiny look about as colourful as Gears Of War. \r\n\n\r\nI definitely didn't see all that coming. I doubt Digital Extremes saw it coming either. Warframe today feels like a lab experiment run amok. I love its appetite for novelty, but there's a lot for a returning player to catch up on and, frankly, it feels like homework. As such, I had a couple of broad motivations for playing Soulframe's pre-alpha \"prelude\": I'm keen to see what Digital Extremes can do when they aren't encumbered by 10 years of world-building, and I want to get in on the ground floor before they absolutely swamp this thing in updates.\r\n \nRead more",

There I was, just starting to get to grips with the card-house-careful balance between each of its units when, bam, makers Game River dropped a Jenga block on top of it. It’s a stealth block, too. Didn’t even see it coming.\nUpdate 1.1’s new unit is the Phantom Ray, which Game River describe as \"a medium-sized aircraft with high HP that excels at striking enemies at close range with high-damage missiles\". It’s a mid-tier flier, costing 50 to unlock and 200 to field, and for that you get three of them per unit. As for default tech, you’ve got some range and fire rate unlocks, alongside an oil drop. The headliner here is the stealth buff, which cloaks the Phantom Ray by default until it attacks. When it does, it all gets a nice 40% bonus to damage.\nRead more",

I wanted to know why I was targeted by such carnal eroticism. I wanted to know more about my character's own relationships. How angels fit into the picture. And why lots of the demons seem quite chill, really.\nBut when it came to the actual survival -  the bit I thought I'd enjoy the most -  I came away a bit disappointed. Exploration is fine, it's just the combat is often too frequent and too frequently irritating. I came to dread the action more than the atmosphere, in the end.\nRead more",

Introduced on Razer’s Huntsman V3 Pro series and quickly followed by Wooting’s (functionally distinct but effectively identical) Rappy Snappy, Snap Tap is now wearing multiple names as it takes over the world of RGB peripherals, from SteelSeries’ Rapid Tap to Corsair’s FlashTap and Keychron’s... Last Keystroke Prioritisation. Which doesn’t sound as sexy, but still.\nHowever, Snap Tap is also drawing a level of ire that exceeds the usual baseline scepticism of hardware marketing. Because it enables a form of input automation – where you can quickly move in two directions by rapidly tapping one key, while holding down another – it’s considered by some as tantamount to cheating, allowing players to cross the line that divides unfair play from the accepted comforts that come with simply using a responsive Hall Effect keyboard or high-refresh-rate monitor. It’s even become a bannable offence in certain games, most notably in Counter-Strike 2.\nNeither side is backing down; in an astonishingly worded tweet, Wooting went as far as to concede Snap Tap \"should be considered cheating. But if it’s allowed, you need it.\" But do you?\nRead more",

          "description": "Correction: A previous version of this article implied that Tequila Works were the developers of The Sexy Brutale. In fact, it was originally developed by Cavalier Game Studios. Tequila Works are the publishers of the game and are also listed as \"co-developers\" on Steam. Very sorry for the mistake!\nOriginal article: The studio behind sunny third-person adventure Rime has filed for insolvency, with the heads of the studio quitting their roles. Tequila Works had their funding from Tencent pulled at some point, according to Eurogamer Spain, leaving the company without an important flow of cash. Which may explain why they cancelled a game last month and laid off some of their workers. It now looks like that was just the first sign of a more serious problem which has sadly resulted in the dissolution of the studio.\nRead more",

          "description": "My strongest and most enduring memory of Grand Theft Auto will always be creasing into complete hysterics watching my mate pile into a crumpled police officer with a wooden baseball bat in GTA 3 after school one time. Young’uns these days just don’t appreciate how revolutionary it was to be able to hit a cop with a thing after he’d already fallen over. Suffice it to say I’ve got good memories of the open world series’ nascent forays into 3D, though never enough to tempt me into revisiting them, especially given the poor reception to Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition. I can sympathise. I’m annoyed just having to type a colon and a dash in the same game name.\nIf you’re in a similarly non-fussed position (I will never not be annoyed that ‘nonplussed’ doesn’t mean what it sounds like it should mean) I can’t imagine a lighting update that’s been available on the mobile versions for a while is enough to tempt you back. But what is a reporter's job if not pathetically treading water between chunklets of Grand Theft Auto news, upon the publishing of which Graham presses the button to release the nutritious pellets on which we all wholly subsist? I hope he doesn’t read that last sentence. I don’t get my pellet if the syntax becomes too convoluted. Moving swiftly on.\nRead more",

Sprinkle podcasts, videos, events and a lot of other things in there and \"games journalist\" doesn't really cover it. \r\n\nOne of the only constants is that I read a lot of writing about video games. \r\n\nDapper gent Oli Welsh wrote for Polygon about the fan reboot of City Of Heroes. We briefly covered fans getting an official license earlier this year, but Oli went and spoke to the folks making it all work.\r\n\n \nRead more",

But to ascribe such unassuming purpose to the duck is to ignore its revelatory power. We must go deeper.\nRead more",

Created by a trio of developers including Hidden Folks designer Adriaan de Jongh, it's a world of spacey, sun-carved mountains, forests and monoliths. The towers resemble the sacred architecture of Monument Valley, and the colour scheme and general ambience remind me of Cocoon. There's a demo, if you fancy it.\n Read more",

There has never been a better time than right this second – averaged out, and despite repeated attempts to the contrary, humanity has never been healthier, freer, or more enlightened by knowledge. It’s true of games too. For every by-committee platter of passionless map markers, there are thousands of more personal, more creative, more interesting works, all adding to the decades' worth of great stuff we can still play today.\nWhat isn’t bollocks is the emotional pull that nostalgia, for all its lack of cold, hard reason, still manages to wield inside our warm, squishy brains. Hence, the centrepiece of Apex Legends’ Season 23 update is a mode that recreates the battle royale FPS as it was back in 2019, defaulting back to the original map and weapon arsenal while cutting the 26-strong legend roster to the earliest ten. It’s a Fortnite-style rolling back of the clock, and a passably enjoyable one, but also a reminder that the good old days weren’t always that good.\nRead more",

          "description": "When multiplayer fishing game Webfishing came out last month, it offered a relaxing hangout zone for cats and dogs. Everything revolves around catching, selling, and collecting the fish that gather in the rivers of a small island. It also lets you customise your character with clothing. Mostly simple hats and shorts, but some options let players celebrate their sexuality, such as a rainbow-adorned t-shirts, or titles that hang above your character which simply say \"Trans\" or \"Bi\". All this led one player to complain there was no \"Straight\" title. So, the developer added one. It costs 10 grand.\r\n\r\n \nRead more",

Pshaw, say publishers Take-Two CEO. They announced a fall 2025 launch in March and have just doubled down on it in their latest financial briefing, with CEO Strauss Zelnick subsequently going on the tellybox to say that Take-Two are \"highly confident in the timing\", though he still has nothing to share about GTA 6 on PC.\n Read more",

It was an art you picked up through practice: how to breathe before the race, saturating your blood with O2 without dizzying yourself; when to permit the shorter, emergency breaths and when to apply restraint; when to deepen your inhales and charge yourself up for an attack on a hill.\nAnd then, how to organise your body around your breath, straightening your posture to expand your lungs without tipping back too far and squandering muscle power; how to breath in time with your stride and the movement of your shoulders, so as to firm up your momentum and shave a miraculous-feeling minute off your finishing time. All this, plus various daft psychological war gambits of my own devising. When overtaking or being overtaken, I used to seal my lips shut on that side and breath through the other corner of my mouth, to make it look like I was hardly out of breath at all.\r\n \nRead more",

Exploring rooms to the side, Alan Wake 2: The Lake House’s star finds whiteboards and documents revealing the typewriter’s purpose: to mimic Wake’s writing. Pages are graded along criteria such as ‘style’, ‘tone’, and ‘content’, then “fed into the algorithm” as references until “near-identical stories” to Wake’s can be produced.\n“If Jules could simply cut the painter open and pull the painting out of him, he would,” reads one of the real Alan’s typewritten pages. That’s Jules Marmont, the obsessive head of the titular FBC centre. The Marmonts - Jules and his wife Diana - are running experiments to forcibly and synthetically create works of art, aiming to mimic creative passion convincingly enough for the paranatural entity inside Cauldron Lake to respond, as it has in the past.\nRead more",

Good news for stealth fans, and perhaps gooder news for a dozen strapline writers sweating profusely, soiling themselves in anticipation of using “kept you waiting, huh?”.\nUntil then, I at least have a steady drip feed of new information to keep me sated, the latest of which is the substantial hint that there'll be some new dialogue in the game, as per the video below. Alongside that, the previously pseudonymous Suzetta Miñet - who was credited with voicing EVA in MGS3 and Peace Walker - has revealed herself to be Jodi Benson, the voice of Ariel in Disney’s The Little Mermaid.

For those wanting to quantify the performance difference between eight and twelve memory channels with AMD EPYC 9005 \"Turin\" processors, here are some benchmarks for showing the workloads that can really benefit from all 12 memory channels and other workloads where eight memory channels can be largely sufficient if looking to minimize costs.",

          "description": "If you're looking to improve your Ultimate Team squad without spending any resources in EA FC 25, the Richarlison Moments and Joao Felix Flashback cards could be worth your interest.\n\n\nThey're part of the newly-released FC Pro Live: Champions Finals, which is now available in Ultimate Team. It's a relatively simple objective set with just two tasks. While completing it might be challenging for some, you can unlock a useful pack and two great cards in the process.\n\n\nHow to get Richarlison Moments in EA FC 25\n\n\nYou'll have to complete only a single task if you want to obtain the special card of the Brazilian attacker. You have a couple of Champions Finals runs to pull off 10 wins in total. However, only the Finals matches will be considered, so you'll have to finish the Playoffs successfully. Once done, you'll be able to try your luck in the finals.\n\n\nThis year, qualifying for the Finals itself has been a huge challenge, so getting the item won't be easy. That said, completing 10 wins shouldn't be too complex if you have no problem with the Playoffs. While the card could be better in terms of its in-game stats, roles, and playstyles, it's free and relatively straightforward to unlock. \n\n\nHow to get Joao Felix Flashback in EA FC 25\n\n\nEarning the 89-rated Felix Flashback will be a massive challenge. You'll first have to qualify to the Finals, and then win 22 games. That's right, you can have a maximum chance of 30 matches, and winning at least 22 of those is mandatory.\n\n\nIf you've played Champions Finals this year, you'll know just how hard the entire ask is. That said, the card on offer has some amazing in-game stats and will fit in almost every available squad. High Pace, great Shooting, four useful roles, and the Technical+ playstyle - Felix has it all.\n\n\nIt's a shame that obtaining the card can be a really hard job unless you're among the elite-ranked players.\n\nThe post EA FC 25: How to get Richarlison Moments and Joao Felix Flashback for free appeared first on Destructoid.",

Since then the series has seen nine main 'numbered' entries and a handful of spin-offs. It's been almost seven years since the last entry in the franchise, Dynasty Warriors 9, which I think most fans of the series would agree was quite average at best. At the time, our very own Chris Carter felt it was 'clunky and unwieldy'.\n\n\nI've always been a fan of 'musou games' like Dynasty Warriors. There's something about mindlessly hack n' slashing your way through hordes of enemies that almost feels tranquil in a way.

          "description": "During an interview with the Daily Star, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director Naoki Hamaguchi confirmed that there are no DLC plans for the second entry of the trilogy. Instead, Square Enix is going full steam ahead with development for the conclusive title of the Final Fantasy VII remake trilogy. \n\n\n\"I think, from my perspective, what the fans really want to see the most is not necessarily DLC,\" said Hamaguchi to the Daily Star in a Thursday interview. \"They want to see the third part of the series as quickly as possible.”\n\n\nImage via Square Enix\n\n\nHamaguchi explained that they don't want to \"focus the development resources on creating additional extra episodes for [Final Fantasy VII Rebirth] DLC at the moment\" and get the \"third game out as quickly as [they] can\" instead.\n\n\nThe first entry in the three-parter, Final Fantasy VII Remake, received an expansion story focusing on new member of the group Yuffie. It introduced her in a new narrative that spans between the first and second parts and was exclusive to the Intergrade version of the game, which had better visuals and a photo mode. Additionally, it made use of the PS5's SSD. \n\n\nUnfortunately, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth's sales haven't been the best for Square Enix. While discussing Final Fantasy XVI and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth in a financial report back in May 2024, Square Enix said that \"profits unfortunately did not meet [its] expectations.\"\n\n\nHopefully, this doesn't mean the third and final entry in the Final Fantasy VII Remake series won't be rushed. What may help sales, however, is that Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is listed as a nominee for Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2024. \n\nThe post Final Fantasy VII Rebirth will not be getting DLC, says director appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Following up on the original 2021 announcement, more details have emerged for the Disney Twisted-Wonderland anime. The adaptation of f4samurai and publisher Aniplex's game is now set to premiere in the first of three seasons in October 2025.\n\n\nThat three-season run will start with the \"Episode of Heartslabyul\" storyline, and the series will stream exclusively on Disney+ (via Crunchyroll News). While dates have yet to be announced, the second and third seasons will be \"Episode of Savanaclaw\" and \"Episode of Octavinelle,\" respectively.\n\n\nAccompanying the news was more on the production staff behind it and a brand new key visual. You can see the illustration featuring the seven dorm leaders nicely lined up below.\n\n\n\n\nTakahiro Natori — who previously directed shows like Tokyo Mew Mew New and the Cannon Busters net animation — serves as chief director and is in charge of series composition. Shin Katagai (Eyeshield 21, My Sweet Tyrant) is directing, and Yoichi Kato (Yo-kai Watch, Aikatsu!) is on writing duties.\n\n\nAnd those sweet designs from Black Butler creator Yana Toboso that made the game so alluring in the first place? Haruka Nakano and Akane Sato are in charge of adapting them for animation. \n\n\nDisney Twisted-Wonderland first launched for mobile devices in Japan back in March 2020, with the English release following in January 2022. It's basically a Villains Academy gacha game full of extremely attractive characters, so an anime adaptation is a total no-brainer. We'll just have to see how long the wait will be between seasons. \n\nThe post Disney Twisted-Wonderland anime kicks off 3-season run in October 2025 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A Cyberpunk 2077 PS5 Pro patch has been requested by fans of the RPG. However, they may be disappointed as the game's developer CD Projekt Red confirmed on Wednesday that the game won't be optimized for the new console. \n\n\n\"We currently have no plans for PS5 Pro patch,\" said the official Cyberpunk 2077 X page (via VGC), responding to a fan asking for optimization for the new system. \n\n\nImage via CD Projekt Red\n\n\nCyberpunk 2077 currently has a bunch of PS5-specific features already. It supports dynamic 4K resolution scaling, ray-tracing, 3D audio, haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, and makes use of the ultra-high speed SSD. The PS5 version also has improved crowd reactions and various visual quality improvements, according to the official PlayStation listing.\n\n\nThe ray-tracing mode, however, only supports 30 frames per second, which the PS5 Pro could possibly remedy if CD Projekt Red gave some time to a port. Thankfully, if you have the PS4 version of the game, physically or digitally, you can upgrade to the PS5 port for free. You can also transfer your PS4 files to the PS5, so you won't lose any progress and finish that lengthy introduction once again.\n\n\nDespite Cyberpunk 2077 missing out on the PS5 Pro's features, there are many games to support the new console. Action-RPG Lies of P has improved frame rates, and Performance Mode supports a full native 4K resolution. The PS5 Pro also delivers a 40% increase in pixel density, and Lords of the Fallen with Performance Mode gives us 4K resolutions at 60 frames per second. \n\nThe post Cyberpunk 2077 won’t be getting a PS5 Pro patch appeared first on Destructoid.",

There is a large spectrum of death penalties in the Survival genre space.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHowever, Towers of Aghasba has only two real punishments for when you die, neither of which are big gameplay inhibitors. The first effect is the most obvious: Dying sends you back to your village. Specifically, the village closest to where you died will be where you respawn. There is no need to have a respawn point built or any sort of bed-like beacon like in most survival games. The only annoying thing about this is that you'll have to trek back to the location of your death to continue your exploration progress. All in all, it's not a big deal.\n\n\nThe second punishment also isn't some major penalty but a light slap on the wrist. When you respawn, you will be missing a large portion of your maximum health. This can, naturally, be rectified by simply eating food that will restore your health to full. Food is not exactly scarce in Towers of Aghasba, thanks to berry bushes being plentiful. Farms and Campfires will also greatly alleviate this negative significantly, as you can harvest food and then cook it for bigger gains right in the safety of your home village.\n\n\n\nThe post What happens when you die in Towers of Aghasba? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Minecraft is just one of those things that's become bigger than its original source material. From its humble days as an indie game created by one person to one of the biggest gaming franchises in history, it's grown into quite the behemoth over its 15-year lifespan.\n\n\nAnd now it's coming to reality. According to a recent report from The Guardian, Minecraft is getting not one but two theme park adaptations. Helmed by Merlin Entertainment – responsible for Legoland, the London Eye, Sea Life, and many more attractions – there will be one park in the UK and one in the US, both styled after the game.\n\n\n\n\nWhile we can't say for certain what these theme parks will contain that relate to Minecraft, we can expect to see them in 2026 and 2027, respectively. Merlin is said to be investing more than $110m into the project and may well lead to parks in other countries if all goes well.\n\n\nImagine being greeted by a blocky Jack Black\n\n\nI'm just trying to imagine some of the rides and attractions these Minecraft theme parks will feature. Cave exploring, no doubt. Maybe a haunted ghost train ride straight into the Nether. Cotton candy that explodes like a creeper? Look, I'm spitballing here.\n\n\nAlongside this, Mojang also recently sent out the latest trailer for the upcoming live-action Minecraft movie, which will star Jack Black and Jason Momoa. You know, the two most obvious candidates to play key characters in an adaptation of a blocky video game. Natch.\n\n\nWhether you're looking forward to the film or the upcoming theme parks, one thing's for certain: Minecraft is not going anywhere for a while. According to the most recent data at the time of writing, over 188,000,000 users have been playing over the last 30 days, and over 960,000 of them within the last hour or so. Those are the types of numbers that ensure longevity for a franchise. Natch x2.\n\nThe post Move over, Legoland, Minecraft is getting its own theme park appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Castle Master, the haunting conclusion to the Freescape engine saga, is now ready for public testing!\nPrepare yourself for a perilous adventure as you lower the drawbridge to enter the Castle Master’s domain. Released in 1990 by Incentive Software, Castle Master became popular for its technical innovation and challenging gameplay. The game inspired countless 3D adventure titles, and the Freescape engine itself marked a technological milestone, enabling groundbreaking object interaction and spatial puzzles.\nNotably, Castle Master was one of the first games to let you choose to play as either a prince or a princess, offering a different experience depending on your choice.\nYour mission: rescue your twin, imprisoned within the eerie depths of Castle Eternity by the evil Magister. This sprawling, foreboding castle is filled with traps, monsters, and puzzles blocking your path. Gather items, unlock doors, and solve complex riddles as you navigate the labyrinthine halls and confront the dark forces within.\nThis modern reimplementation showcases enhanced graphics using OpenGL, with initial support for the DOS and ZX Spectrum releases. If you’re eager to embark on this dark journey, a playable demo is available to test your tenacity.\nTo participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.\nWill you brave the creepy corridors of Castle Eternity and free your sibling, or will you fall victim to the Magister’s curse and join his army of enslaved spirits? The adventure awaits!\n>",

          "description": "After seven months of intense work, we are ready to announce support for a few games based on qdEngine, developed by K-D Labs.\nThe work is based on the original sources published now under GPL, although the work started a bit earlier than that. The engine supports 14 games, five of which we are announcing support for. Most of these games were released in Russian; however, there were Lithuanian, Czech, and Polish releases. The support is announced for:\nWait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare, (Russian: Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца, Lithuanian: Na, palauk! Zuikio dainos, Czech: Jen počkej a Píseň pro zajíce)\nMask Show (Russian: Маски-шоу)\nMarvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки.

День рождения морской крысы, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Urodzinowe Śledztwo)\nOther games do work; however, we haven’t playtested them. You may find more information on our Wiki. Also, we are looking for the Lithuanian version of Little Longnose and Polish releases of Little Mice games and Wait for it! game. If you happen to have a copy, please contact sev.\nWe continue the active development so that support for other games will follow shortly. The primary constraint is playtesting.\nTo run these games, you need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any hiccups during your quests, please file them on our issue tracker.\n>",

          "description": "We are excited to announce that Rise of the Dragon  is now ready for public testing. This is the first of a small number of games built using the DGDS (Dynamix Game Development System) engine.\nThe Dynamix name may be familiar – bought by Sierra in 1990, the Dynamix brand continued and became well known for action and puzzle games like The Incredible Machine, A10 Tank Killer, and Red Baron.  They also made a few adventures using the custom DGDS engine.\nRise of the Dragon is set in Los Angeles in a dark version of the future, circa 2053.  You play as Blade Hunter, a private investigator and retired police officer.  After a designer drug kills the mayor's rebellious daughter, Chandra, Hunter is hired to find the people responsible for releasing the drug on the streets. What Blade ultimately finds is much more than he expected.  Rise of the Dragon combines classic point-and-click adventure style with platforming arcade sequences, giving a unique gameplay combination.\nYou’ll need the latest daily build of ScummVM and files from the DOS version of the game, which you can buy at GOG (check our wiki for the required data files).  Please file any issues you notice on our bug tracker.\n>",
