          "description": "It’s a grower.\nStrange Horticulture takes on some big challenges. It’s a carefully authored story that wants to be driven by interaction, and it’s a single-scene play space that wants to create immersion in a whole world. It’s such a tricky line to walk between structured gameplay that’s interactive but dry and a carefully managed story that limits interaction. But with Strange Horticulture, Bad Viking pulls it off. It creates deep immersion in a well-rounded world while starting from a simple place. The filling-out of the world as we played came from our own discoveries, and we were drawn powerfully into the emerging intrigue of the plot.\nIn Strange Horticulture, Bad Viking has created a mystery story set in a bizarro-style English Lake District, where real-life place names nestle amid castles, stone circles and religious cults. The player runs an apothecary dealing in specialist plants with medicinal, mind-altering, magical and even mechanical effects. Each day, a series of customers arrive at your counter in need of horticultural help. By cross-referencing what’s on your plant shelf with what’s in your plant-cyclopaedia, you identify the salves, syrups and embrocations that are needed. There’s a loop of learning and labelling plants to receive more plants and more info pages that immediately sucks you in.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

After some silence from Game Freak and The Pokémon Company on the upcoming open-world RPGs, we got a full 10 minutes of news, visuals, and info, and there are a lot of new features coming.\nOf course, Scarlet & Violet weren't the only games that got some time in the limelight, but it's what we're probably most happy with. Because the rest of the presentation followed a pretty standard formula. Some of us loved what we saw, particularly from generation 9, but it also has some of us asking — have Pokémon Presents become a bit too predictable?\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Excitment reached fever pitch (just check out the comments section of any Mario Kart Tour related content if you don't believe us!), so naturally, expectations for the latest batch of courses are exceedingly high. Was it all worth it, though? Let's find out.\nWith the addition of Wave 2, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has now gained a total of sixteen new tracks so far in 2022. Just let that sink in for a moment: sixteen new tracks. It's a five-year-old game, for goodness sake. Eight, if you count the original Wii U release!

Summer camp culture isn't as much of a thing in the UK, possibly because we're fairly happy to allow our children to learn to tie knots by themselves, by affixing each other to disused railway tracks or sick trees. In any case, the summer camps I've seen portrayed are usually unwholesome ones, because they're good horror fodder. Camp Canyonwood is a camp counsellor sim, out now in early access, where you (an bird) look after a flock of demanding smaller birds. It sounds like it would be twee, except the owner is cutting corners and you dream about a talking jackalope. I have not explored these aspects much because I am constantly trying to feed the children.\nRead more",

          "description": "Ice Code Games may have called it Hard West 2, but 'round these parts we refer to it as \"The Laughing Deer Show\". New to town, are ya? Let me clue you in. Laughing Deer is a six-foot man of raw muscle and rage, a native American warrior with shoulders like a pair of yoked oxen and a personality best described as \"barely contained\". Unlike the rest of his posse, which includes a cowboy without a shadow, a woman with ties to the occult, and one very stubborn corpse, Laughing Deer doesn't really \"do\" guns. While his compatriots are all crouched behind crates, ricocheting bullets off buckets and wheelbarrows to hit enemies from behind, Laughing Deer is getting in their faces (shortly before his club gets significantly further into their faces).\nNow, bringing a club to a gunfight might not seem like the smartest idea. But while pistols require two of a gunslinger's action points to shoot, and rifles take all three, it only takes one action point to whack some neckerchief-wearing bandit with a big ol' stick. And Laughing Deer whacks a whole point of damage harder than normal, meaning he can rush foes and nail them into the ground with a couple of hard swings before they can pull the trigger. Better yet, killing an enemy completely refills a character's action points in Hard West, meaning that, when set up right, Laughing Deer can ping around the battlefield like a weaponised pinball. \nRead more",

Thus, we discuss Lucasarts games like the Monkey Island series. See, I tied it all together.\nIn fact, I'm not sure if I'd wipe Monkey Island from my head or not, because I can't be sure how much of my love for it is fuelled by nostalgia. Matthew has other concerns, though, because as is our usual fashion we spend some time discussing the question \"what games would you play for the first time again?\" more literally than is intended. What grave consequences would come from erasing certain things from your brain? What sort of person would co-host Nate be if he wiped the Civ games from his memory?

That means it's a good time to pick up current-gen models at a discount while availability is good - and this RTX 3080 12GB model is the cheapest we've ever seen it. \nRight now, you can pick up this Gainward Phantom RTX 3080 12GB for £724 when you use code AFF25 at the checkout at CCL. If you're not familiar with CCL, the British retailer is a minnow compared to the whale of Amazon, but it's one that has existed since 1996 and has always proved reliable for me. \nRead more",

I'm playing Aran's Bike Trip, a visual novel/interactive diary/thingamy where Dutch indie dev Aran Koning (the designer of Stacklands) documents a two-day bike tour with 360° photos. It's a lovely little adventure, taking in sights including an art deco radio station and the tallest waterfall in the Netherlands. The waterfall is... about what you might expect in a notoriously flat country.\nRead more",

Fortunately, that seems to be more than just pastel colours and cynical “For girls” marketing – the G375 headset, G705 mouse, and the G715 and G713 keyboards are all proper gaming-spec accessories, and they’ve been crafted by mostly female design and engineering teams based on feedback from women PC players.\r\n\n\r\nThe G705, then, is a wireless mouse designed for smaller hands, while the G375 headset – also wireless – is proportioned to fit smaller heads and has more space in the earcups to accommodate earrings. It’s safe to say I’m not the Aurora Collection’s target audience, but having used the G705, the G375, and the G715 wireless keyboard as my main peripherals for a few days, I can say all three are pretty swish playthings regardless of how you identify. What’s more, their light, soft-cornered aesthetic is a nice break from the blacks, greys and harsh angles that have become standard design language for gaming gear. Anyone who’s ever cringed their face inside out at a peripheral resembling Megatron’s running shoe may indeed find these more to their tastes.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The origins of Wolfenstein 3D, a gloriously violent game that paved the way for the even more gloriously violent Doom, can be found in a somewhat more cutesy series of titles: the Commander Keen series. id Software made four of these side-scrolling platformers for MS-DOS in very quick succession between 1990 and 1991, and studio co-founder John Romero tells us that the team was definitely ready for a change.\nRead more",

While she's killing time on the journey, she begins to take a dating personality quiz aptly titled ‘What’s your Thirstsona?’ and it transports her to a colourful dreamlike metaverse where she can skate around and answer deep questions about her love life. Is she really a lost cause in love? \nRead more",

I've wanted to quote that for years but had yet to play a game using them that grabbed me enough to warrant an article. Let us be thankful, then, for ADACA, an angry playmobil FPS.\nIt's actually two games, and I'm not sure which to call the main event. I know which one I prefer, because the story mode is a love letter to Half-Life 2, complete with Bane-muffled jackboot cops, endlessly catching up with a Story Guy who's inexplicably ahead of you again, a bionic arm standing in for the gravity gun, and a spooky dark underground section where you're swarmed by creepy mutants. It was good enough to tempt me this week, despite a few minor niggles, but its other half, Zone Patrol, is a Stalker-esque sandbox where it really shines.\nRead more",

It is a completely unhinged combination of words that makes me giddy just thinking about them. I’ll often find myself muttering them out loud when I’m unloading the dishwasher or folding laundry. “Unstoppable raptor horde”. It’s like the season finale of language. It’s perfect.\r\n\n\r\nAdmittedly, prior to the existence of that phrase, I was feeling a little sceptical about Exoprimal’s existence. Not only does Capcom have - let’s say - a less than favourable track record when it comes to multiplayer titles, but as a long-term fan of Dino Crisis I was a bit miffed to see them creating a game featuring prehistoric creatures that wasn’t some kind of lavish remake of my beloved PS1 series.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The patch came out on Tuesday and, if you've played The Sims 4 since then, you'll have automatically downloaded it unless you've been playing offline. While the patch's release coincides with the High School Years expansion and supports a number of its features, it also added several new elements to the ever-evolving base game. These include long-time fan requests like sexual orientation customisation, body hair options, and the return of a wants and fears system in the style of The Sims 2.\nRead more",

Bloomberg reports that the game’s design director and art director were subsequently fired from developers Aspyr Media during the week after the demo was finalised.

Instead, your city flourishes or not based on your ability to fulfil each building's resource requirements, which quickly turns progress into more of a puzzle than a management game.\r\n\nIt's out on Steam now, and you can find a trailer of its pretty voxel world below.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Tencent reportedly opening wallet for majority shares\nTencent is reportedly interested in becoming a majority stakeholder for developer/publisher Ubisoft. According to a new report from news outlet Reuters, the holding company, already a minority stakeholder, is considering making a significant investment in the Assassin's Creed/Far Cry developer in the near future.\nCiting multiple sources \"with direct knowledge of the matter\", Reuters claims that Tencent has expressed a desire to become the key shareholder for Ubisoft, and is allegedly willing to pay an astounding premium of over $100 USD per share in order to make it happen — more than twice the share's current value. Reuters report, unsurprisingly, caused a rise in Ubisoft stock Wednesday, with a 15% rise in value increasing Ubisoft share prices from $43.03 to around $48.33 .\nThere have been many whispers of a possible Ubisoft sale for some time now, with rumors that the Guillemot family — some of whom are the company's initial founders — might have been looking to purchase the company outright themselves. Should Tencent choose to put its money where its mouth is, however, it seems very unlikely that anyone would be able or willing to match its proposal of an approximate 130% share price. And perhaps the holding company is willing to offer such a premium for that very reason.\nTencent, of course, already has minority and majority stakes in numerous major players within the gaming industry. As well as owning several internal development studios, Tencent holds varying stakes in companies such as Activision, Supercell, Epic Games, Remedy, Riot Games, PlatinumGames, Bohemia Interactive, Dontnod Entertainment, Klei Entertainment, Inflexion, and Funcom.\nThe post Rumor: Tencent looking to become majority stakeholder in Ubisoft appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Announced at BitSummit\nInti Creates is at it again, continuing to corner the 2D market with the new action platformer Grim Guardians: Demon Purge. The game is actually being shown this weekend at BitSummit in Kyoto, Japan, on August 6 and 7.\nGrim Guardians will feature two playable characters (who are sisters) in the form of demon hunters trying to rescue their school from peril: Shinobu Kamizono (ranged attacker) and Maya Kamizono (melee). Inti Creates says \"swapping characters is key to gameplay,\" and in addition to solo play, there's also a two-player co-op mode. As our own CJ Andriessen points out, those two names are from Gal Gun: Double Peace.\nAmazingly, Inti Creates is calling this \"the beginning of a brand new series of 2D action games,\" hence the obvious subtitle. Whereas Azure Striker Gunvolt is their own take on the Mega Man franchise, so too will Grim Guardians mirror aspects of Castlevania (like their Bloodstained tie-in projects). Hey, if Konami isn't going to do it, someone else should!\nGrim Guardians: Demon Purge release date and platform info\nAs for a release date and platforms, the former is listed as \"TBD,\" but the latter includes PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. The official website will likely be the first place we'll get that info.\nJust as I said in my recent Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 review, I'm game for basically anything Inti Creates that even looks remotely like Grim Guardians.

          "description": "A new GDK update could see some graphical improvements for the Series S\nA recent update to Microsoft's Game Development Kit is adding a little extra bump in memory for the Xbox Series S. Memory allocation in a GDK update will potentially allow graphical improvements for Xbox Series S games.\nIn the June GDK, an unlisted video as spotted by The Verge popped up today, detailing improvements to the developer toolkit. One part  notes that more memory is now available for games.\n\"Hundreds of megabytes\" have been freed up, according to the video. This should give developers more control over memory, and could improve graphical performance in memory-constrained situations.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb6ZLGwkClM\nAs Ars Technica details, this hasn't been publicly detailed yet. But this could see developers get a little extra memory to work with on the Xbox Series S side of Microsoft's current-gen hardware.\nMore memory for the box\nThis seems like good news for Xbox Series S fans who want a little graphical \"oomph\" on their games. The Xbox Series S is the cheaper of Microsoft's two current-gen offerings, and has proven to be popular.\nThe relatively cheaper and smaller machine has been a nice surprise for players. It's especially nice for those who aren't necessarily chasing 4K resolution graphics. But as Digital Foundry notes in its Xbox Series S write-up, differences can appear game-to-game.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94O6o6yOGgA\nHopefully, freeing up this extra memory will help out the Series S versions and deal with some troubles around optimizing for the system. While hundreds of megabytes isn't a sudden multi-GB swing in horsepower, it could be a little uptick that could do a lot.\nThe GDK update also notes other changes as well, like addressing an issue with graphics virtual addresses. We'll see how this GDK update ultimately pans out for Xbox Series S users in the games to come.\nThe post Xbox dev tools update gives developers more memory for Series S appeared first on Destructoid.",

Because I will not be doing it again\nOne of the most fun (and frustrating) ways to play an old favorite is trying to complete a self-imposed challenge that really ratchets up the difficulty. For me, it was beating a run in Hades on 32 heat — for others, it might be completing a Dark Souls run without taking damage or doing a Nuzlocke of a favorite Pokémon game. When you love a game enough to put the hours in that you need to complete a challenge like this, you'd be surprised at how much you can accomplish — and by how triumphant it feels when you finally beat it.

          "description": "It's to establish a new identity, and also a bit easier to say\nKoch Media, a games publisher under the grand umbrella of the Embracer Group, is changing up its name. The publisher formerly known as Koch is now Plaion, as the 28-year-old company is rebranding.\nUnder the moniker of Koch Media, the company operated publishing labels like Deep Silver and Prime Matter. It's part of various games and brands, ranging from Homefront and Metro to Saints Row and Dead Island. The company was purchased by Embracer Group (THQ Nordic at the time) in 2018. Now, it will operate under a new name.\nIn a press release, Plaion says this new name will better represent the company's history and the groups it works with.\n\"Our new name offers us the opportunity to build on our rich history as a publishing partner and our outstanding, constantly growing network of world-class development studios and creative people, to keep delivering premium service to our partners, to highlight our ambition as a global player within the entertainment industry but also to reinvent ourselves,\" said Plaion managing director Klemens Kundratitz. \"Our vision is to enable and inspire our worldwide teams and partners, unlocking their full potential.\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgjzDJA1o1E\nWhat's in a name?\nSpeaking to GamesIndustry.biz about the name change, Kundratitz also expresses hope that the name change will make more of an international impact.\n\"Our name for so many years was associated with physical distribution, perhaps with us being more of a central European company–although including the UK because that was among the first three countries where we launched,\" Kundratitz told GIbiz. \"But we're perhaps not seen as a global company. And it's sometimes difficult for some people to pronounce.\"\nFor the record, Plaion is easy to pronounce. It's just play-on. The company's new logo is also stylized around the common triangle used for Play.\nThe post Publisher Koch Media rebrands to become Plaion appeared first on Destructoid.",

Now, in the final stretch of Coconut Mall, the Shy Guys don't just sit there in their cars.\nThe developers shared a short clip of the new Shy Guy antics.\nhttps://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1555191948956368897\nGranted, in the original Mario Kart Wii version of Coconut Mall, the obstacles were deadlier — the cars drove back and forth and were harder to avoid. That isn't the case here.\nThis Coconut Mall fix is more of a middle ground for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe players.\nThe Shy Guys are less static than before (excluding the Time Trial mode, as pictured above), but they aren't too annoying, either. Before, they felt lifeless in a kind of jarring way, and people definitely noticed that something felt off near the finish line. So it's good to see Nintendo go back and improve things, even if it's a small detail in the grand scheme.\nAfter you're done playing the Turnip and Propellor Cups in Wave 2 of the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pass, maybe circle back for a match on Coconut Mall. I'm excited to hop online tonight, especially for the all-new track, Sky-High Sundae.\nAt this point, kind of against all odds, I feel like I've gotten good mileage out of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pass.\nThe post Mario Kart 8 Deluxe updated Coconut Mall so the Shy Guys don’t sit still appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Hardly out-of-pocket, in all sense of the term\nMobile gaming, which has continued to grow from strength to strength on a yearly basis, saw its first decline in revenue for some time in the first half of 2022. The slump in overall sales and in-game transactions hit most genres, though many of the most popular titles continue to hold steady.\nThe new data, published by the industry analysts over at Sensor Tower, shows that only the \"Arcade\" genre saw any significant growth, with a raise of around 14% year-on-year, which equates to somewhere in the region of $176 million USD. Almost all other genres — from racing games to puzzlers, RPGs to shooters, and even the cash cow of casino games — all saw a hefty decline in sales figures.\n\nOverall, the U.S. mobile gaming market was down by almost 10% over the previous year. This won't find the industry on the ropes just yet, however, as it still raked in somewhere in the region of $11.4 billion. Astounding. The decline in mobile gaming revenue has been equated to both the increased cost of living, economical issues, and the softening of COVID-19 restrictions, which has seen more people out and about, rather than sitting at home idly on their phones.\nMobile gaming is just one of a number of industry sectors that have reported a revenue decline in 2022. Publishers such as PlayStation, Activision Blizzard, and Nintendo have all seen either hardware, software, or operating income fall when compared to the same period the previous year. While none of these slumps are big enough to cause any sweats, it is clear that the gaming industry as a whole is entering something of a down period, one very likely to continue as 2022 progresses.\nThe post Mobile gaming saw a decline in revenue during the first half of 2022 appeared first on Destructoid.",

While the studio has made an official reveal for Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection Vol. 2, it remained shy about delivering any information whatsoever pertaining to the release.\nThe original Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection launched on PC and Nintendo Switch in March of 2021 and is packed out with 10 hit games for SNK's awesome, but ultimately unsuccessful, handheld console. The original release featured hits such as Samurai Shodown! 2, SNK Gals Fighters, Dark Arms: Beast Buster 1999, Big Tournament Golf, and The King of Fighters R-2, but did not contain independent re-releases such as SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash, or the brilliant Match of the Millennium. (Note: MotM was only excluded from the Steam edition.)\nWhile SNK has not announced platforms, a release date, nor a game listing for the second selection, one would assume it would compile the aforementioned omissions and — if we're extremely lucky — the NGPC ports of Bandai Namco's Pac-Man and Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog. According to SNK, more details are set to follow soon.

New enemies threaten to cause a bunch of problems for the Cleaner crew.\nBut the survivors will have some back-up, too. A new playable Cleaner, \"Prophet\" Dan, is also joining the action. A previous preacher of the end times, he'll probably make for a wacky addition to the roster of playable characters.\n\nThe expansion will also include some new weapons, cards, and skins. Anyone who picked up the Back 4 Blood Annual Pass, or the Deluxe or Ultimate Edition, gets Children of the Worm as part of that. Otherwise, Children of the Worm will be available as a standalone purchase.\nThe ongoing apocalypse\nThis new entry marks Back 4 Blood's second expansion, following after the Tunnels of Terror DLC expansion that went live in April. The Tunnels added some new Cleaners and special variations of the Ridden to deal with, alongside the Ridden Hives.\nWith an Act 5 on the way and even more stuff to do, it's nice to see that Back 4 Blood seems to be getting a steady cadence of post-launch support. It was a pretty good time for co-op at launch, and I really grew to like the card system that Turtle Rock created for this new variation on the co-op PvE survival game. Even if it hit some stumbles out of the gate, Back 4 Blood has kept on rolling on.\nAnd if you like Turtle Rock's particular brand of PvE, well, it's a good time. Not only is Back 4 Blood getting some more content, but apparently the servers for Evolve have popped on and players have been dipping a toe back in.\nAs for the Children of the Worm, the new DLC expansion arrives on August 30 for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.\nThe post Back 4 Blood gets its next expansion, Children of the Worm, at the end of August appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Wii U YouTube app now has an end-of-life date, and so do two other services on the console.\nAs pointed out by Nintendo Everything, the YouTube support page for the Wii U was recently updated, stating: \"Note: The YouTube app is no longer available for new downloads from the Wii U eShop due to Nintendo’s upcoming discontinuation. Starting in October, the YouTube app will no longer be available on Wii U devices. Viewers can still enjoy YouTube on Nintendo Switch devices.\" Although the 3DS and Wii U shutdown is March 27, 2023, a few companies are getting things started a little earlier (to prepare for the other phase of the shutdown, where on August 29, 2022, you can't use Nintendo eShop card funds on both marketplaces).\nCrunchyroll is doing the same thing, as this Twitter user has revealed: they sent out an email to Wii U users that service was ending on August 29, 2022. Finally, Niconico has a page up similar to Google, which talks about the end of service, mostly for the 3DS app, which has been in operation since 2014.\nIt all makes sense, it's just rare to be able to talk about the two systems these days: so I'm going to take every opportunity. Also, the below \"we're sad to see you go\" image from Niconico is great.

          "description": "Giant Monsters All-Out Attack\nI have been a fan of kaiju and Japanese giant monster films since a childhood friend lent me his VHS of Godzilla 1985 for a weekend. Eight years old at the time, I didn’t realize the movie was actually a pretty crappy Americanization of a far superior Japanese film. I just liked watching this big green lizard tear shit up. I watched the tape three times over that first weekend, forever changed by what I saw. To my eight-year-old mind, this was cinema.\nBy the time school rolled around on Monday, I was already making plans to scour my local video rental shops for whatever Shōwa and Heisei era Toho films they were hiding on their shelves. Once I was finished with all of those, I moved on to the video games, where my fanaticism was quickly tested. The world was st…",

Two Point Studios launched Two Point Hospital with the intent of building a landscape where all their future games would happen. Two Point Campus is the next step. It’s not a sequel, but the aesthetics, the characters, and even the UI call back to their first title. It reminds me of Maxis in the ‘90s before and directly after EA got their evil all over them. A lot of the games sprung up around SimCity, and while not all of them were as directly related as the ones from Two Point Studios, some were tied together, even if it was just in a reference.\nI’ve been eagerly waiting for the next step in the Two Point experience.

The developer announced that delay earlier today on social media, with a rescheduled date to be announced.\n\"A big thank you to everyone playing MultiVersus. It’s exciting to see so many players enjoying the game and the launch of the Open Beta is just the beginning,\" said the team on Twitter. \"We want to let everyone know that we are delaying the start of Season 1 & the release of Morty to a later date. We know this might be disappointing for some and want to assure our Community that we are dedicated to delivering new and exciting content that delights players.\"\n\"We’ll let you know the timing as soon as we can. We appreciate your patience & enthusiasm and look forward to unveiling Season 1 very soon!\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvborgKG7fw\nMultiVersus, which entered open beta just last week, has already had a very impressive opening, with the PC version logging an amazing peak of 144,000 players during its opening weekend. The free-to-play fighter quickly became the fourth most popular title on Steam, with the impressive figures not even taking into account additional player numbers for the PlayStation and Xbox editions of the beta.\nAs MultiVersus is still in its playtest stages, Player First Games is using this time to gather various feedback about the title, from its online connectivity and crossplay function, to in-game balance and various bugs that may need ironing out (and I ain't just talking Bunny). If you want to check out the action for yourself, then all you need do is download the game client on the platform of your choice, and you're ready to rock.\nMultiVersus is in open beta now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post MultiVersus season one has been delayed, new date forthcoming appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Nintendo has dated them for September 9\nIt's not often you get amiibo news anymore, but Nintendo did just that, and gave us a date for the Steve and Alex Minecraft amiibo figures: September 9. Note that this is the same day Splatoon 3 is out!\nAs a reminder, the duo is actually coming out as a result of their appearance in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as fighters, and will function as normal as characters that can be trained as CPUs with the figures themselves. While the jury is still out on US orders, they've been available to pre-order for nearly a year now on some Japanese marketplaces as a two-pack, including Amazon Japan (where I secured a pre-order in October). The date for some of those markets still lists \"December 31, 2022\" as a placeholder release, which we expect to shift soon given this news. While amiibo do not strictly follow a \"global release date\" system, it's typically close enough barring regional delays.\nProduction on amiibo has slowed down in recent years, and 2022 has only hosted the Min Min figure thus far. Soon it'll have Steve and Alex, as well as three Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak figures. As for what's left, we don't know for sure what the future holds on random and third-party tie-ins, but we do have the rest of the Smash Ultimate DLC cast to go: Sephiroth, Pyra/Mythra, Kazuya, and Sora.\nAs always, we have a full up-to-date list of amiibo that's been updated since 2015.\n[Update: At the time of this update, Best Buy has the 2-pack in stock. This 2-pack format seems to be the way they're being distributed all over the world, and is consistent with 2021 pre-orders.]\nThe post Both the Steve and Alex Minecraft amiibo will be out in September appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "FIFA's final days keep EA in the premiership\nIt's the turn of long-time developer/publisher Electronic Arts to share its results from the most recent quarter of the 2023 financial year. And while many publishers are showing a slump in overall revenue, EA seems to be relatively healthy, powered by its ongoing dominance over the sporting game industry.\nOverall revenue for EA is up 14% year-on-year, which translates to a meaty $1.77 billion USD. Net income is also up — offering a huge 52% rise which equates to $311 million. It will probably come as zero surprise that the FIFA franchise is still one of the aces in EA's portfolio, with FIFA Mobile and microtransactions service FIFA Ultimate Team continuing to grow in both revenue and users. FUT has, notably, seen its user base rise by 40% in the past 12 months.\nIt also seems that EA's purchase of Codemasters was a very savvy decision, as the UK developer's F1 22 has actually outperformed on the publisher's expectations. Codemasters was, of course, purchased by EA for $1.2 billion back in early 2021. EA was hoping that the acquisition would give it a dominant stake in the racing game market, and it seems that the British studio is already delivering on those hopes.\nThis year's FIFA entry, FIFA 23, will be the final football sim released with the official FIFA branding. While EA has a huge task ahead in rebranding one of the biggest and most profitable gaming franchises on the planet, the community knows where its dedication lies, and it seems hugely unlikely that the loss of the FIFA brand will harm EA's bottom line in the bigger picture.\nThe post EA delivers solid quarter revenue results, driven by F1 and FIFA Ultimate Team appeared first on Destructoid.",

But a new report claims a potential Warcraft mobile game has fallen through.\nBloomberg reports that a World of Warcraft mobile game has been shuttered. The project was in development for three years, but according to Bloomberg's sources, the two companies disagreed over financial terms and ultimately called it off.\nThe team of over 100 developers has allegedly been disbanded. Some were reportedly offered internal transfers. A spokesperson for NetEase declined to comment on the matter to Bloomberg. An Activision Blizzard spokesperson gave no comment.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtSmAwpVHsA&ab_channel=Diablo\nWarcraft in the palm of your hand\nThe canceled project, code-named as Neptune according to Bloomberg, was a massively multiplayer online RPG set in the World of Warcraft universe. The report says it wouldn't be a direct one-to-one of the mega-hit WoW, but a spinoff set during a different time period.\nNetEase and Blizzard have collaborated on several major projects, so the report comes as a bit of a surprise. Alongside Diablo Immortal, which has received some frustrated reactions from fans, NetEase also publishes World of Warcraft and other Blizzard franchises in China.\nThough fans haven't been wild about the microtransactions, Diablo Immortal has continued to see growth, and World of Warcraft is building up to the launch of its next expansion Dragonflight.\nWhether this is a stumbling block or not, it looks like mobile Warcraft plans are on hold for now.

For years, this series has been lauded as a graphical powerhouse, and this teaser sizzles in this way.</p>\n\n<p>We'll have to see how the footage shown breaks down as far as new gameplay features, but it would appear perimeter play is getting some of the spotlight this year. The realism in the superstars is also on display, both on the court and in how they celebrate and interact with fans.</p>\n\n<p>NBA 2K23 will have three different looks on retail stands with NBA Legend Michael Jordan on one cover, Phoenix's Devin Booker on another, and the WNBA's Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi on the third. Michael Jordan's return unfolds through 15 different Jordan Challenge scenarios that recreate key moments from his career.</p>\n\n<p>More details should be coming soon, as 2K Sports aims to ship NBA 2K23 on September 9 for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.</p>",

The trailer dives into the game's fourth region,&nbsp;Sumeru, which is home to people who can't dream and worship the God of Wisdom.</p>\n\n<p>Suermu looks lush in foliage, with mushroom creatures scurrying about the trunks of sizable trees. It also contains a desert area and looks to be just as sizable as the game's other areas.</p>\n\n<p>The trailer also introduces a host of companion characters that players will meet as quests are completed. The first new character is Tighnari, a forest watcher who we see holding a magical firefly. In Port Ormos, players will run into Alhaitham from the Haravatat in the Akademiya. Further into the game, players meet Dehya of the Desertfolk, who is also a mercenary for the&nbsp;Emerites. There are also Nilou, a character who is pursuing art and dance, Nahida, a mysterious being, and Cyno, the General Mahamatra.</p>\n\n<p>All of this content is a part of Genshin Impact's 03 update, which doesn't have a release date yet, but appears to be close, given how much miHoYo has revealed. Genshin Impact is currently available on PlayStation consoles and PC, and works just as well on Android, and iOS.</p>\n\n<p>Are you still invested in Genshin Impact? If so, what do you hope to see from the new update?</p>",

You’ll spend much of the game scrounging for materials as you traverse ruins for clues about the island’s history and how you ended up in this dire situation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>According to the game’s <a href=\"https://thelostwild.com/faq/\" target=\"_blank\">FAQ</a>, The Lost Wild won’t be arriving until late 2024 or early 2025.
