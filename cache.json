However, unlike the majority of life simulators currently dominating the eShop, Potion Permit presents no crops to cultivate and no farm animals to tend to, and instead relies on medicinal foraging to help those around the town, which may be a welcome change of pace for life sim fans who've had their fill of farming.\nPotion Permit immediately thrusts you into the role of the village chemist. You've been called to Moonbury through a special request sent by the mayor, so you must accept. But upon arriving, the town's citizens turn a cold shoulder toward you and won't explain why. So even though you're quickly whisked away to a private neck of the woods and instructed that it's your sole purpose to heal the townsfolk of any number of unlikely illnesses, the game focuses on the distaste toward the capital and its chemists and requires you to prove yourself.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Of all the many games launching in the latter third of 2022, this is perhaps the most dependably, dryly predictable in form and function: a Let's Sing game featuring songs by Abba. Sure, you might be curious about the playlist or the various modes in this particular entry of the long-running karaoke series, but as video games go, this particular quantity is about as 'known' as they come.\nPerhaps you're here for the same reason we said 'yes' to review code: sometimes you just need something reliable and restorative. Times are tumultuous and the unexpected offer of a night in belting out some bangers with friends and family in a no-stakes, low-stress environment sounds like just what the doctor ordered. For hardened gamers, there's no worrying about avoiding spoilers online or impaling yourself on a difficulty spike with Let's Sing Abba; it's as wonderfully low-maintenance and uplifting as you expect it to be.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Triangle Strategy already felt like it was pushing the limits, but we’ve now been graced with the delightful Various Daylife. After an initial exclusive launch on the Apple Arcade subscription service, this new, low-key RPG from Team Asano has made the jump to Switch for the low (but still kinda high…) price of thirty bucks. Offering up a bite-sized take on the kind of gameplay that catapulted titles like Bravely Default and Octopath Traveler to success, Various Daylife proves itself to be a decently fun experience, but it also demonstrates that the phrase “less is more” applies to playtime, too.\nThe story of Various Daylife begins with your character arriving in the city of Erebia on a new continent. As part of an ongoing colonization effort, Erebia is full of opportunity and promise, and there is still quite a bit of untamed land and mysteries beyond the city's borders. To help in the effort of expanding the city, your character joins an expedition team and begins fulfilling various odd jobs between excursions, making friends and allies along the way. The narrative, then, is not defined by a larger plotline as such; rather, it’s the mosaic of smaller intersecting stories that comprises the bulk of the Various Daylife experience.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

As well as a convenient place to relieve yourself and top up on snacks, these futuristic service stations also house cosmetic surgery bots, operation tables, teleportation booths and more - and they're all overseen by a powerful AI trying to find the best possible future for the human race. As the station's head clerk, you'll debate the ethics of eternal youth and end of life care, while also making sure your station has enough power, stocked shelves and a happy customer base. It's certainly an intriguing combo compared to other management games out there right now, so I sat down with director Laurent Victorino and writer Antony Jauneaud to find out more.\nRead more",

Beatrix LeBeau has packed up her slime-wrangling gear and has crossed the Slime Sear to Rainbow Island, a new land packed with new mysteries and new slimes.\nAs a seasoned slime wrangler myself, I was excited to dive head-first into this new, colourful world. Review code didn't arrive until launch day unfortunately, but all week I've been vibrating with anticipation. After spending a handful of hours frolicking with slimes and skipping around Rainbow Island, though, that early dazzle is starting to wear off. Monomi Park’s sequel feels a little too familiar to its predecessor in its early game, and it's put a major downer on my goo-hoovering adventures.\nRead more",

          "description": "Out Of Hands is a fairly \"does what it says on the tin\" title for this, a game where you play a dude who dreams he is made entirely out of hands every night. It also operates as a decent joke, because rather than being out of hands, he, if anything, has too many. So full marks for the name. The game itself is kind of a deckbuilder but not really, and though it also describes itself as a thriller, I can't say my heart rate was raised. In fact, behind the (admittedly very cool) visual style there seems to be a pretty run-of-the-mill \"a girl I liked is no longer in my life and I'm pretty cut up about that\" story. I guess in the full game it might turn out she was murdered, or she mudered the main character, or the main character murdered her - just, some kind of murder, maybe?\nBut in the four demo levels I played recently, it seemed like a pretty normal breakup. I was really excited to give it a go, but in the preview I didn't find the contrast between a face made of squirming hands and the well trodden women-be-leavin' plot to be particularly affective or evocative. The squirming hands are cool, though.\nRead more",

That's because you're able to fuse together any monsters you 'catch', but moreso because it's a monster collectathon where you become the monster, essentially fusing yourself with bomb dogs and hermit crabs with traffic cone-homes.\nI like the way the game does away with the overdone shonen story of wanting to become the very best there ever was, and instead puts the spotlight on its cast of characters and the relationships you form with your buds. It's looking mighty promising.\nRead more",

          "description": "If you've ever wondered what the 1987 film Running Man might look like as a turn-based tactics game (see also last year's Netflix sensation Squid Game, if the Running Man reference doesn't quite do it for you), then Homicidal All-Stars probably comes pretty close. It's the debut game from Artificer, a new studio formed by a bunch of ex-CreativeForge devs who worked on the first Hard West and Phantom Doctrine, and it centres on a woman called Scarlett who finds herself competing in the deadly TV show that gives the game its name. Like Running Man, Squid Game and all those other 'deadly games' you know and love, Homicidal All-Stars is about folks who down on their luck fighting for their lives, where their only consolation prize in these dystopian bloodbaths is not getting pulped at the end of it. \nFor Scarlett, this means mowing down scumbags in classic turn-based fashion with a bunch of other friendly competitors she's teamed up with, but this is far from a straightforward XCOM-like. Between fights, you'll also be navigating its trap-filled arenas in third-person, dodging sniper turrets, disabling tripwires, and dashing over spiky/fiery/horrible pits to get to the end of each 'episode'. It's a refreshing mix based on an early preview build I've been playing recently, especially when its gameshow hook allows for its malicious host, Orion Ford, to start meddling with your success. \"He’s the person behind the worst of the twists,\" creative director and Artificer CEO Kacper Szymczak tells me. \"He’ll start filling the level with poisonous gas, he’ll turn off the lights, drop explosive barrels everywhere, to name just a few.\"\nRead more",

Supermassive Games have given their first two The Dark Pictures Anthology some extra care and attention today, dropping in new difficulty settings and accessibility options, tweaked UI, and even faster walking for characters. There’s also an extended chapter for Man Of Medan. I didn’t think update trailers were a thing but there’s one for this, which you can watch below.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "It's tough making a story where you establish early on that your main character will still be alive at the end. In The Excavation Of Hob's Barrow, a point and click, small town, folk horror adventure game, the events are narrated by the main character Thomasina, writing in the future, and the game walks a slightly different line. Rather than successfully making you believe a character you know survives is in peril, all the way through The Excavation Of Hob's Barrow you are aware that Thomasina in the future is alive but, somehow, definitely not okay. And you believe you can save her anyway.\nThis looming dread, growing increasingly loom as the game goes on, is one of the most effective weapons in Hob's Barrows' arsenal of horror. Thomasina, a barrow-digger and proto-feminist trouser-wearer in a time when trousers were worn by men, is a practical and mostly cheerful woman. She approaches all the puzzles she has to solve in the robust, roll-your-sleeves up manner of an old-timey governess who doesn't care if you hate learning French verbs. The Thomasina of the future voiceover, however, sounds blank, drained and sad. It's a contrast that weighs more and more heavy as you slice into the horrible heart of Hob's Barrow, and it underscores how great it is to play the game in its fully voiced form.\nAs well as the voice acting, Hob's Barrow has an appropriately creepsome soundtrack, making fabulous use of the juddering bass tones that put all humans and related monkeys automatically on edge, and isn't a stranger to unsettling lighting. Evil in this game is a sick purple. Most of all, some praise should be especially given to the several horrible close-ups that pop up: Thomasina's eyes, wide in shock, a malevolent cat as he crawls onto your bed; round eyes over a slack, downturned mouth with little peg teeth in it. Devs Cloak And Dagger Games can coax extraordinary depth and motion from their pixel-art and then use that to repulse you.\n Read more",

While I'll hold my hands up now and say that Soulslikes have always been a bit of a challenge for me, I feel like I've been making some pretty good in-roads into the genre lately, and after falling in love with Moonscars' reveal trailer earlier in the year during the Humble Games Showcase, I really, really, really wanted to like this one. Sadly, it's become increasingly clear that Moonscars does not like me very much, and maybe even hates my guts a bit - which is ironic, considering how many organs I've chucked at its feet over the last week and a bit to appease its hungry dread moon. \nRead more",

Where the original offers a more traditional top-down view where you're avoiding cops' attention by dodging cones of vision, Serial Cleaners sprinkles different characters and abilities into the mix, alongside a visual revamp that ups more than just the aesthetics. And it works! Making the act of evidence disposal an action-packed affair that makes it a great game to play in bursts.\nRead more",

Valve themselves have the case covered, including a decent hard case with even the cheapest 64GB models, and it’s not difficult to pick up one of the best microSD cards for the Steam Deck. Otherwise, and especially with delays to Valve’s official dock, there’s not much out there from the usual PC hardware suppliers.\nI therefore turned to the makers and sellers of Etsy, where a kind of indie Steam Deck accessory market has emerged. Soon, I’d bought (with my own money, you’re welcome ReedPop) a selection of unique, handcrafted, sometimes questionable gadgets and appendages, and promptly packed them onto a train for independent appraisal by a newly minted Steam Deck owner. Specifically, RPS vid bud Liam.\nRead more",

          "description": "The RPS-beloved turn-based strategy game Solium Infernum is back from the dead. Announced earlier today on stage at EGX London 2022, Armello creators League Of Geeks will be resurrecting and reimagining the game in 2023. Originally released in 2009 by solo dev Vic Davis and his studio Cryptic Comet, Solium Infernum cast you as an Archfiend hoping to stake a claim for Satan's empty throne. With a strong emphasis on political intrigue and Machiavellian backstabbing over taking things by force, this strategy game from hell was a firm RPS favourite back in the day, spawning an eight-part diary series of the team's play-by-email multiplayer adventures. Alas, it never quite found the audience it deserved back in the early 2010s, eventually causing Davis to shut up shop completely in 2015 and pursue a career in tabletop.\nLeague Of Geeks are here to change that, though, and after speaking with studio director and co-founder Trent Kusters (both at EGX earlier today and during a hands-off presentation of their pre-alpha demo late last week), it's clear the team have taken great care in bringing Solium Infernum up to date for modern audiences. It leans into all the same kinds of mind games as Cryptic Comet's original, and its simultaneous turn structure is still very much intact – just with lusher 3D visuals, and all-new, revamped menu screens. And it looks devilishly good.\nRead more",

It reminds me of those cuckoo clocks where on the hour every hour a tiny door opens revealing two mechanical dolls that come together and have a 'lil smooch. That’s essentially how Wayward Strand works but on a bigger scale. Characters are set on strict routines, following predetermined paths and schedules that are often invisible to you. They welcome an interruption - a friendly natter or helpful hand - but whether you’re there or not, they’ll go about their business regardless. The world keeps on spinning and all that.\nIt’s an interesting way of capturing the passage of time, and in Wayward Strand how you choose to spend that time is pretty important in a game that makes a point of not waiting for you.\nRead more",

          "description": "Have you ever played a game and thought, \"Are we actually the bad guys here?\" Usually, the whole \"we're fighting on the wrong side of history\" line is a deliberate plot device in RPGs, offering moments of clarity to not only peel back the curtain and provide fresh impetus for the events yet to come, but also to cleverly reframe everything you've achieved so far. I don't say this to spoil the events of The DioField Chronicle, the new real-time strategy game from Lancarse and Square Enix, but it is a question I found myself asking a lot during its middle act - and it never quite delivers the punchline you're looking for. \nAround 8-10 hours into the game, there's an extended portion of the campaign that sees your band of Blue Fox mercenaries bringing an entire region of DioField Island to heel because they're, err, pro democracy. Of the cast's central quartet, only one stands up as a voice of reason when motions are made to quell these despicable riots, but he's repeatedly shot down every time he tries to offer an alternate view. Eventually, one character says to him, and I quote, \"Isca, what has got into you? You ought to know the danger posed by the ideology of democracy.\" It's an odd stance for someone clearly not a villain to take in 2022, although really, I should have probably seen it coming. Our mercs work for a duke after all, and most are aristocratic nobles who are handy with a sword. Oh no. I think this might actually be played: Tories - The Game. Yuck. \nRead more",

          "description": "I'm a sucker for invention when it comes to story in video games, and Beacon Pines drew me in with what looked like a choice-driven adventure. As you explore the down-on-its-luck farming town of the title, you discover 'charms'. Each charm is a word which can be deployed at set points to branch the story in new, severe ways. More importantly, you can flip back and forth between these pivotal moments at any time, allowing you to deploy new words in earlier chapters to see what happens.\r\n\nExcept, Beacon Pines is far less choice-driven than I expected. Instead, it's something far rarer and more ambitious in video games: it is a good story, well written, with strong characters you grow to care for.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Both first-person score attack shooters are dressed in similar beautiful cloaks of skulls and gurgling industrial soundscapes, but while Devil Daggers nudges you into cautious survival, Hyper Demon shoves you into aggression. In Hyper Demon, a long and cautious run will likely score lower than a short burst of ultraviolence. What glorious ultraviolence it is!\nWhen I first saw Hyper Demon's trailer, I felt excitement, wonder, and fear. Here's the important thing to realise: the unearthly and incomprehensible violence you see in that trailer is genuinely what the game looks like to play. That's how it feels to play, too.\nRead more",

For whatever reason, I was expecting this survival horror adventure to ditch spookiness for kookiness, perhaps rattling my bones with hyper-violence and monsoons of crimson.\nNope - the game wasn't what I expected at all. At least, not the 45-minute portion I got to play. Rather, my demo was more of a hardcore puzzler with some exploration elements and the teeniest smattering of action. Don't get me wrong, it was still unsettling and grotesque! Just in more of a brain-training way, if the brain-training was for MIT graduates, or like, the human calculators on University Challenge.\nRead more",

Now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, it's Namco's futuristic tank battler, Assault.\nReleased to the Japanese arcade scene in 1988 under the title \"Akeaka Assault,\" before trundling west under its simpler, localized title, Assault is a future-set top-down shooter that puts the player in the driving seat of an intergalactic tank, and tasks them with bringing down their planet's colonizers in a uniquely dark narrative — and one that is surprisingly prescient to modern eyes... \nIn Assault, you play a native warrior of a far-off planet, who starts out upon a one-man rebellion again…",

          "description": "It's a waiting game\nAnyone who's been into games for more than like a day knows how long the wait can be for our favorite titles to release. Game delays are a dime a dozen these days, but for some fans, the wait is so long, you start to wonder if you'll ever get to see the Promised Land. While the development cycle can be anywhere from a year or two to six or seven years at most, there are some games out there that we've been waiting much, much longer for. One of those games is Beyond Good & Evil 2, a long-awaited sequel to Ubisoft's beloved classic. It's been so long since the game was initially teased at Ubidays 2008, in fact, that the title is considered the longest-awaited AAA game of all time.\nThe previous record-holder in this regard was Duke Nukem Forever — players had to wait over 14 years from its announcement in 1997 to its release in 2011 (or 5,156 days, to be exact). We've now been waiting 5,236 days for Beyond Good & Evil 2 as of the writing of this post, and it doesn't look like we'll be getting any updates any time soon.\nUbisoft did release a full trailer for the game at E3 back in 2017 that looked pretty good, but I guess it would have been a pretty bad omen if it didn't considering they had supposedly been working on it for nine years at that point.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsoIUHDrPcg\nSome Reddit users have pointed out that we wait so long for some games that they become something of an urban legend. Beyond Good & Evil 2 certainly fits the bill there, along with Half-Life 3 and whatever project Ken Levine is supposedly working on.\nPart of me wants to respect whatever difficulties are likely going on behind the scenes to draw development out this much, but another part of me is so beyond curious to hear about any development drama. Oh well, if it's anything interesting, Jason Schreier will probably write a book about it eventually.\nThe post Beyond Good & Evil 2 is now the most delayed AAA game of all time appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's also developed by PlatinumGames, who've done a lot to build their audience on Nintendo consoles in recent years.

Sega is allowing studio Double Jump Games to license the Sangokushi Taisen IP for its new blockchain project, utilizing the company's \"Oasys\" technology. Details are sketchy at this juncture as to what form the blockchain element will take, but characters and artwork from the series are likely to be part of the collectible process.\nAs you have likely read about, here and else, the blockchain and NFT market, allows for the creation of artwork, icons, items, and other tokens to be stored in an online capacity, with ownership rights to be bought, traded, and sold. While the past year has seen all manner of franchises and companies swiftly declare their love for the new tech, the market itself has proven incredibly unstable, leading to huge losses in revenue, stolen \"ownership\" of items, and artists' work stolen and \"resold\" in NFT format.\nIn addition, video game companies trying to implement blockchain/NFT technology into their titles have often backpedaled in the face of criticism and derision from their respective communities.

Set within the walls of a desolated, intergalactic prison complex — Black Iron — The Callisto Protocol follows the unenviable escapades of a party of investigators who find themselves lost within the aftermath of some terrible event, rendering the prison, and perhaps the entire planet itself, a viral, mutant-filled, living nightmare. What caused this whole abomination? It's your job to find out.\nOh, and if you live to tell the tale, that would be useful too.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yf_mXDPAKw\nAs protagonist Jacob Lee, players will explore Black Iron and its surrounding, fending out a grotesque army of twisted guards and prisoners with an arsenal of melee and ranged weaponry. As Jacob picks his way through the cells, corridors, and execution chambers of space jail, he will slowly piece together the clues pointing to what exactly happened on Callisto moon and, with any luck, find a way to stop it. The Callisto Protocol is looking suitably creepy, incredibly gory, and worth a spot on the radar of any survival horror fan.\nThe Callisto Protocol launches on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms December 2.\nThe post Discover the splatteriffic fate of Black Iron Prison in The Callisto Protocol appeared first on Destructoid.",

This long forgotten continent will comprise or four new areas — The Waking Shores, The Azure Span, The Ohn'ahran Plains, and the opulent kingdom of Thaldraszus — each packed out with quests to be undertaken, dungeons to be raided, and loot to be gathered, providing hours upon hours of new adventure for the community.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UANuDDQTNKY\nAlongside the new locations, Dragonflight will also play host to a metamorphic new class, the Dracthyr Evoker. These characters can switch between their human and dragon forms, and will represent the first-ever \"hybrid class\" in WoW's long and storied history. In addition, as the expansion's title suggests, Dragonflight will feature a brand new, fully overhauled flight system, allowing players to take to the air with the greatest of ease in more deliberately controlled, skill-based aviation. What's that in the sky?\nWorld of Warcraft: Dragonflight will launch globally on Monday, November 28, for specific times for your chosen territory, check out the details over on the official Dragonflight website. Good luck, scalies!\nThe post World of Warcraft: Dragonflight expansion will lift off November 28 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Ed Sheeran x Pokémon love affair continues\nI love a good pop star/video game crossover, and thankfully they're pretty common these days. As part of the upcoming release of Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet, Pokémon teamed up with global pop sensation Ed Sheeran, whose new song will be featured in the game. It's called \"Celestial,\" and the music video is out right now, featuring familiar faces like Squirtle, Pikachu, Machamp, and Snorlax, just to name a few. Fans are guessing that it might be used as an end credits song, or possibly as an upbeat opening to the game.\nBelieve it or not, this isn't the first time that Ed Sheeran has collaborated with the Pokémon brand. Last year, he put on a virtual concert in Pokémon GO that players could watch in-game. The concert included performances of six of his most beloved songs, and players could find special Pokémon as part of the event, including a Squirtle wearing sunglasses. Rapper Post Malone also put on a virtual concert for Pokémon fans last year to celebrate the series' 25th anniversary.\nhttps://twitter.com/Pokemon/status/1575504573909069827\nPersonally I'd love to see more songs written specifically for games. Movies license well-known artists for their projects all the time — that's how we got bangers like \"Sunflower\" by Post Malone and Swae Lee for Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse or \"All the Stars\" by Kendrick Lamar and SZA for Black Panther.\nThat's not to say this hasn't been done already for games, though — the example that comes to mind is Florence + the Machine's cover of \"Stand by Me,\" which served as the theme song for Final Fantasy XV. Then there's \"Popstars\" by K/DA, which was the theme for the 2018 League of Legends World Championship, which was a virtual girl group formed by members of the K-pop group (G)I-DLE as well as some western artists. Basically, I just want more songs like those, and this new Ed Sheeran number is a good start.\nThe post Ed Sheeran drops a new song in collaboration with Pokémon appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s real-time, rather than turn-based; it’s about tight, compact skirmishes rather than drawn-out battles.

          "description": "Finally, some good news\nIt feels like these days, we hear of a game's launch getting delayed at least once a week, but the developers behind the upcoming biopunk survival horror game Scorn have flipped the script. Instead of pushing back their release date, Ebb Software has announced that Scorn will be coming out on October 14 now, a week ahead of its previously planned October 21 date. They haven't given a reason why the game got moved up, but I certainly don't hear anyone complaining about it.\nThe game is inspired by the works of Swiss artist H.R. Giger, who is best known for his depictions of humans merged with machines. There's definitely plenty of creepy uncanniness going on there, which makes it the perfect title to come out right before Halloween. According to IGN, who got to play the first hour of the game, it has a big focus on puzzles, with the most apt comparison being The Witness when it comes to gameplay. I love that Scorn leans into more of a heady, intellectual spookiness that has the player exploring the labyrinthian corridors with little to no direction at all.\nhttps://twitter.com/scorn_game/status/1575542179946237954\nAs the game's Steam page describes:\n\"Scorn takes place in an open-ended world with different interconnected regions. Each region is a maze-like structure with various rooms and paths to discover. All the storytelling happens in-game, with no cut-scenes to distract you from the grisly reality of the living, breathing world you’re in. But keep your eyes open — the game won’t show you any sympathy if you miss something important on your uneasy travels.\"\nWe haven't seen a game fill the grotesque horror niche in quite a while, so here's hoping that it lives up to the hype. I can't speak for anyone else, but Scorn usually isn't my kind of game, yet I feel really compelled to try it.\nThe post Scorn’s release date moved up appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A local village for local people\nAnybody fancying a little bit of a slow burn scare this weekend would do to take a look at Cloak & Dagger Games' latest release, The Excavation of Hob's Barrow, now available on PC via Steam and GOG.com.\nSeeped in folk horror vibes and sporting an aesthetic reminiscent of the golden age of the Commodore Amiga, The Excavation of Hob's Barrow is the tale of author and antiquarian Thomasina Bateman, who is traveling the length and breadth of the countryside to explore the many barrows of Victorian England.\nhttps://youtu.be/x-1C_9RQJb8\nWhile her travels so far have brought about many interesting sights and characters, Bateman's arrival in the little-known village of Bewlay sees her research expedition take a particularly dark turn — with our intrepid hero becoming mired in a world of unanswered questions, ancient cultures, and living nightmares, as she delves deeper into the village and its highly unnerving community.\nChoosing atmosphere, mood, and impending dread over the genre's well-worn trope of tired jump scares, The Excavation of Hob's Barrow blends mystery, exploration, and a sense of ancient malevolence to weave its tale, beckoning the player in with its intriguing locale, creepy cast of characters, and plucky, daring protagonist. It looks to be a real sleeper hit of the year, and well worth checking out for those who like their ghostly goings-on a little on the psychological side.\nThe Excavation of Hob's Barrow is available now on PC via Steam and GOG.com.\nThe post The Excavation of Hob’s Barrow has unfurled its folk horror on PC appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Good Fortune\nFun news for retro block-busting fans this week, as publisher Forever Entertainment has announced a return for the classic puzzle series, Magical Drop. Magical Drop VI, developed by studios Highball Games and Storm Trident, is scheduled to launch later this winter on Nintendo Switch.\nMagical Drop, for those less inclined, is a cute 'n' colorful arcade puzzler that first launch in 1995, at the height of the \"tile-puzzler\" craze. Playing from one of a number of cute avatars, all based upon the Tarot, players must cherry-pick colored orbs from a rapidly descending playfield before firing them back in an effort to match the rainbow-infused patterns together. The goal of Magical Drop is to cause a chain reaction, and thus the player is encouraged to set up several moves ahead of time, that can all be triggered with one final, scalpel-precise move, (hence the series' Japanese title \"Chain Reaction\").\n\nDeveloped by Data East and published by SNK, several Magical Drop games were released to arcade and home platform markets throughout the mid-'90s. The series' most recent release, Magical Drop V, launched on Steam in 2012 and was an enormous disappointment, riddled with bugs and issues that often rendered it incompletable. The game was eventually pulled from sale. This new release will no doubt be looking to capture the charm and character of classic entries while delivering engaging gameplay within a variety of single and multiplayer modes.\nThe visual style depicted here looks a bit \"Flash game,\" but I remain hopeful, as Magical Drop happens to be my personal favorite of all the tile-puzzle franchises. My character of choice? Empress... But then... you knew that already, right? Shock-freakin'-horror.\nMagical Drop VI is currently in development for Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Magical Drop VI to see the charming puzzler return on Nintendo Switch appeared first on Destructoid.",

Sackboy: A Big Adventure is getting a PC port on October 27.\nSumo Digital's thread-bound platformer released for PlayStation 4 and PS5 in 2020, as part of the PS5 launch lineup. Now, it's getting the PC treatment, with some new features in tow.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAaEqyE_Hfg\nThe new port of Sackboy will allow for 4K resolution with a target of 120 FPS, if you've got the hardware for it. The platformer will also support a range of display ratios, including wider options like ultrawide, or 21:9.\nSackboy: A Big Adventure will also have NVIDIA DLSS2, or Deep Learning Super Sampling, for those with compatible graphics cards. Variable refresh rate support will also help with all that platforming.\nWhile that's all for higher-end hardware, the PlayStation Blog also highlights lower-end options. It seems like owners with relatively older hardware might still be able to make this game run, albeit at lower settings.\nThe next big adventure\nSackboy is getting some customization options too. A Big Adventure will fully support the DualSense controller, so you can get those haptics and dynamic trigger effects, same as PlayStation 5.\nMouse and keyboard will also be supported, in both gameplay and the user interface. Achievements are included too, as are cloud saves on both Steam and Epic Games Store.\nThis seems like a good grab for folks who dig co-op in particular, but maybe don't have the newest hardware. As per our review, Sackboy: A Big Adventure seems like a pretty enjoyable co-op platformer to blast through with a friend or family member.\nSackboy also marks another PlayStation-exclusive game headed to PC. And considering how well these have been going, like with Marvel's Spider-Man and God of War, I'd hope to see more continue making their way over.\nThe post Sackboy: A Big Adventure journeys to PC in October appeared first on Destructoid.",

Wait, the Switch already had Skyrim?! About that!\nAs a reminder, nearly five years ago, Skyrim came out on Switch (and subsequently, every device ever). \"I knew it!\" you're all saying right now. The one that's coming out today on the platform is actually the \"Skyrim Anniversary Edition,\" which has the following features:\n\"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim celebrates 10 years of adventuring in stunning detail. The Anniversary Edition includes a decade worth of content: the critically acclaimed core game and add-ons of Skyrim Special Edition, plus pre-existing and new content from Creation Club including quests, dungeons, bosses, weapons, spells, and more.\"\n\nWhat does Skyrim Anniversary Edition on Switch actually have?\nThose features, to be exact, include:\n\"The core game, pre-existing and new Creation Club content, plus all three official add-ons: Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and Dragonborn.\"\n\nNintendo of Europe points out that in addition to buying this new \"complete bundle\" for $69.99, you can also upgrade your existing version for $19.99. Of course, it's almost parody at this point: putting some convoluted version of Skyrim out on some other platform randomly without warning.\n(Cue the old man voice) Back in my day, we played Skyrim with no mods or DLC! And it was...sort of OK! But eventually small-to-large DLC packs came out for it, some mods rose in popularity (and were integrated into the game by proxy), and then a GOTY edition came, and the rest is history. We're stuck in an endless time loop of Skyrim, with Skyrim Anniversary Edition being the latest version.\nThe post The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition just dropped on Switch with no warning appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "History repeats itself\nFor the longest time, Sega's Shenmue series was renowned for being an incomplete saga — an epic tale that had no ending. It seems, ironically, that history is set to repeat itself, as it has been suggested that anime adaptation Shenmue: The Animation has been canceled, and will not receive a second season.\nThe first inkling that the show would not be returning came from the Cartoon Network Schedules Twitter, which noted that the anime had been removed from the Adult Swim VOD archive. This would then be followed by a mournful message from Cartoon Network Senior VP of Animation, Jason DeMarco, who confirmed on the social media site that Ryo Hazuki would not be returning for further adventures.\n\"Sorry guys. This happened,\" wrote DeMarco. \"And yes, it’s looking like no [season 2] of Shenmue, even though sadly — it did well enough that we were gearing up for [season 2]. Maybe one day…\"\nhttps://twitter.com/Clarknova1/status/1574971363453857792?s=20&t=KiMywArbYuExEOnWij9fTQ\nIt's disappointing to hear that the show was canned despite being, apparently, something of a success. Unfortunately, as TV/movie fans are fast becoming aware, streaming media has become a Wild West Show, with shows, characters, films, and IPs being shot down, binned, or canceled within the blink of an eye, or, more accurately, the swipe of some suit's pen. We see you, Batgirl.\nIf you want to watch Shenmue: The Animation, then the entire first season is available on anime network Crunchyroll. It's a strange irony to see the Shenmue anime adaptation canceled and rendered incomplete in the same way the video game series was once rendered incomplete. Still, an ending — in a fashion — did eventually rear its head, (even if it took several decades). So keep the engine turning on that forklift truck. Stranger things have happened.\nShenmue: The Animation is available to stream on Crunchyroll.\nThe post Shenmue anime canceled; will not be getting a second season appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Rowing Blazers, a New York-based clothing brand, has announced a new line of Sonic the Hedgehog apparel. The collection draws inspiration from Sonic's aesthetic from the 1990s, with graphics inspired by art from the time. \nThose who are interested in the collection can look forward to clothing items like a cotton sweater with Sonic's image, a zip-up polar fleece, heavyweight rugby jerseys, a French terry loopback hoodie, cotton tees, and mesh shorts. The line also includes baseball caps, canvas tote bags, a necktie, and a hand-embroidered Sonic patch for blazers and other clothing items.\nYou can see a gallery of some of the items in the collection below.\n\nAccording to Jack Carlson, founder and creative director of Rowing Blazers, which has done collaborations with FILA, Umbro, the NBA, and more, the company's creations all hold important links to his personal life.\n\"A lot of it has to do with the things I loved growing up: the sports, the brands, the culture,\" he said in a press release. \"I grew up in the '90s playing Sonic the Hedgehog on the Sega Genesis. Sonic has always been such an interesting character to me. In the original games, he was a little bit brash, a little bit punk. He was different from other cartoon and video game protagonists. He was very '90s. Of course, there have been a lot of Sonic clothing capsules created over the years. I wanted to do something elevated, really beautifully made, and kind of timeless in its aesthetic. Of course, there's a kind of irony to it because Sonic himself isn't really very preppy, but that's the fun of it.\"\nThe collection retails as low as $38 to $325, though nothing is currently listed at the higher end of that spectrum just yet. The collection is live now, having launched yesterday. If you'd like to check out the collection for yourself, you can head here.",

          "description": "Google has revealed that its cloud-streaming games service, Stadia, will shut down early next year. \nMore specifically, Stadia will close down its platform and end its online servers on January 18, 2023. After that, you won't be able to access the Stadia service in any way. As for your games and hardware, Google is offering refunds \"for all Stadia hardware purchases (Stadia controllers, Founders Edition, Premiere Edition, and Play and Watch with Google TV packages) through the Stadia store,\" according to an FAQ posted by Google today. It seems like the only aspect of Stadia that won't be refunded are Stadia Pro subscriptions. However, you \"will be able to continue playing your games in Pro without further charges until the final wind down date.\" \nIf you are hoping to get a refund for your hardware, Google says \"most hardware purchases...made directly from Google\" will not require you to return your hardware. The company intends to have the majority of refunds processed by Stadia's January 18 shutdown date. \nThe Stadia Store and all its functions have been turned off so you will not be able to make any more Stadia-related purchases or in-game transactions. \nStadia shutting down isn't the most surprising news. Despite cloud gaming's continuing rise in popularity as of late thanks to the likes of Microsoft's Xbox Cloud Gaming initiative and others, Stadia never seemed to really take off. The first big sign that Stadia might not be long for this world came back in February of last year, when Google revealed it was ending its first-party game development and closing two studios. Then, this February, word got out that Google Stadia had reportedly been deprioritized by the company. Now, Stadia has just a few months left in it before it becomes a part of history. So long, Stadia. \nDid you use Stadia? What do you think of this news? Let us know in the comments below!",

It was delayed to at least March 2020 after that, but things went quiet and the game missed that window. Then, in May of last year, Ubisoft announced that Skull and Bones would release sometime between April 1, 2022, and March 31, 2023. And now, it's slipping out of its November 8 release date, which was only just announced back in July, into a new March 9, 2023 date. As for why, the team cites a need for more polish and balancing.\nKotaku's Ethan Gach says sources say the teams working on Skull and Bones are burnt out. According to Gach in his Kotaku story, the latest technical test for the game ended on September 19. One source involved with the test told Kotaku that gameplay was more refined than in previous tests but that progression needed work as it still felt too shallow. Gach writes that this is a concern shared by multiple sources close to the game's development. \nHere's what Ubisoft has to say about the delay: \nThe last the public saw of Skull and Bones in a big way was during a July showcase, which is where we saw extensive gameplay and received the now-delayed November 8 release date. I learned a lot more about the game around the same time when Skull and Bones was Game Informer's cover story.

As such, this new Diglett-like Pokémon is called Wiglett. It looks like a worm, lives in the sea and on the beach, and seems to stick together with other Wigletts. Check it out in Serebii's video below: \n\n\nI'm most excited to see Wiglett's evolution, if it evolves at all. But hopefully, I'll see that in another trainer's party because I'm not sure Wiglett is a sure bet for mine. \nFor more about Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, watch the latest trailer that shows off new school rivalries, gym leaders, and more, and then watch this trailer all about competitive play in the 9th generation of Pokémon.

We learned during Summer Game Fest that Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson, who portray Joel and Ellie in the games, will have unspecified roles in the series. The Last of Us will be available to stream exclusively on HBO Max in 2023.\nTo help prepare fans for what's to come, Naughty Dog recently released a remake of the first game dubbed The Last of Us Part 1.

We now know the dates of the event as well as how it will be structured.\nE3 2023 takes place at the Los Angeles Convention Center from Tuesday, June 13 through Friday, June 16. Digital presentations, such as the annual press conferences held by first and third-party publishers, take place a couple of days before, beginning June 11. \nThe ESA also states that the show will feature separate admission days for industry professionals and the general public. E3 Business Days, designated for developers, publishers, and press/media, take place on June 13-15. Media registration opens in December. \nJune 15-16 will host E3 Gamer Days, where fans will be admitted to the show floor. There is no date for public registration at this time. Since E3 first opened its doors to fans in 2017, professionals and the public have largely intermingled for the entirety of the show, which has caused issues in terms of crowd traffic. E3 adopting the same dividing format as events such as Tokyo Game Show should alleviate that problem.   \nAs previously announced, PAX/New York Comic-Con organizer ReedPop will helm E3 2023. The company has promised to make E3 into a \"world class event to serve the global gaming industry.\" The last E3 to take place in-person at the LA Convention Center was in 2019.

Join us today on Twitch at 2 p.m. Central to enjoy two hours of what will be a full playthrough of the cult favorite action game streaming weekly each Friday. \nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance serves as a sequel/spin-off to Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots that puts cyborg ninja Raiden at the helm. Instead of sneaking around in boxes, players eviscerate foes in fast-paced, stylish action courtesy of developer Platinum Games. Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. \nWatch on Twitch!\nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, along with Blake Hester as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

          "description": "The Apple TV show Ted Lasso has proven to be one of the most popular and well-liked series of the last few years, introducing viewers to a lovable cast of characters whose lives and storylines largely revolve around the fictional English Premier League football club, AFC Richmond. Through its first two seasons, the series has taken home numerous awards, including the Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series in 2021 and 2022, with several of its actors – including Jason Sudeikis, Brett Goldstein, and Hannah Waddingham – taking home awards for original performances. Now, Ted Lasso reaches into a new realm: video games. \nEA Sports today announced that Ted Lasso and AFC Richmond are joining the FIFA 23 roster of teams. Lasso is joined on the sidelines by Coach Beard, with the pitch being populated by some of the team's biggest stars like Jamie Tartt, Roy Kent, Dani Rojas, Sam Obisanya, and Isaac McAdoo. While the actors' likenesses are included in the product, EA Sports hasn't indicated if we'll be hearing Jamie Tartt and Roy Kent's signature crowd chants (though it seems doubtful, seeing as how Roy Kent's chant would probably bump the ESRB rating up to M for Mature).\nRegardless of that fact, you can play matches at AFC Richmond's home ground, Nelson Road, and even take control of Coach Lasso or AFC Richmond through Career Mode. AFC Richmond is also playable in Kick-Off, Online Friendlies, and Online Seasons. FIFA 23 Ultimate Team is also adding several AFC Richmond customization items, including kits, TIFOs, and the option to select Ted Lasso or Coach Beard as your FUT club's manager. All the AFC Richmond content in FUT will be obtainable through objectives and challenges.\nYou can see Ted Lasso and the AFC Richmond squad in action through the trailer below.\n\n\nFIFA 23 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4. Xbox One, PC, and Stadia on September 30.",

          "description": "I adore Final Fantasy VII, and I was similarly enamored with Remake. Given the latter game’s events and the tantalizing trailer for its second part, Rebirth, it had me thinking that it may be a good time to dust off my copy of 2008’s Crisis Core. Square Enix read my mind by announcing a remaster of Zack Fair’s PSP adventure, christening it with the subtitle “Reunion,” giving newcomers the answer to the question of “who the heck was that black-haired fella in Remake?” As for me, I thought I had a good reason to return to the game. After playing a decent chunk of Reunion at Tokyo Game Show, I’m all good. \nMy expectations were always reasonable. Reunion is a remaster, not a remake the scale of, well, Remake. That means that feature-wise, the best way to sum it up is “That PSP game? You can pl…",

          "description": "Let me fill you in on a little secret most people won't tell you: the real way to enjoy a video game show is at home, comfortably on your couch, watching the event on YouTube. \nOver the years, the game press has done a remarkable job tricking you into thinking otherwise. The shows look extravagant, energetic, and almost like we're getting glimpses into the future, which we then curate into bite-sized news stories and on-demand trailers for our faithful readers back home. \nThe reality is much more depressing.\nWhether it's E3, PAX, Gamescom, or in this case, Tokyo Game Show, going to a video game trade event means dealing with the near-lethal combination of jetlag and overwork. The brutal FOMO of being in some of the coolest cities in the world but spending all your time in convention halls. The unbelievable cacophony of thousands of people talking at once. The unbelievable smells of thousands of people all standing too close to each other. The never-ending lines of thousands of people all needing to use the toilet at the same time. This doesn't even touch on the unavoidable safety concerns of having a video game conference in the midst of an ongoing pandemic. But I digress.\nAll that said, there's some fun stuff to look at, like big, gaudy statues and giant booths that likely cost tens of thousands of dollars for games you've never heard of and likely will never play. Stuff that really makes it all worth it. \nWhile we'd love to fly each and every one of you out to Tokyo, sadly, we only had the budget to fly out two of our full-time employees. So in lieu of attending yourself, please enjoy my curated batch of pictures of what I saw on the show floor. \nWell, there you have it, folks. All the fun of TGS without actually being there. See you next year!",

Now, we know when we can play it because Saturnalia has captured an October 27 release date. \nThat's when it will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via the Epic Games Store). Developed by Italy-based studio Santa Ragione, the team behind games like Fotonica, MirrorMoon EP, and Wheels of Aurelia, Saturnalia is shaping up to be a great time. You can find out why in the New Gameplay Today segment we recorded that's all about Saturnalia, featuring more than 15 minutes of gameplay, below: \n\n\n\"[Saturnalia] is a kaleidoscopic adventure inspired in equal parts by authentic Sardinian folklore and classic Italian Giallo horror films,\" a press release reads. \"The story involves a mysterious, centuries-old ritual that occurs every year on the night of the winter solstice in the Italian village of Gravoi. Each of the game's four playable characters must utilize their unique abilities and confront their own personal revelations in order to expose the secrets haunting the town and ultimately escape their doom.\"\nHere are some additional Saturnalia highlights from Santa Ragione: \nSeek clues in a maze-like village with no markers or compass to guide your steps.\nExplore the ever-changing town of Gravoi using matches to keep the dark at bay.\nFlight and stealth are your only options, as you cannot fight the creature that hunts you.\nImmerse yourself in the stop-motion animation and vibrant expressionist art style of Saturnalia for an eerily beautiful atmosphere that is as enthralling as it is chilling.\nControl your fate through non-linear progression and a dynamic, adaptive narrative, with unique endgames dependent on player choices.\n\n\nSaturnalia hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC via the Epic Games Store on October 27. \nAre you going to check this game out?
