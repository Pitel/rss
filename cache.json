While it doesn’t go as deep into its mechanics as other games in the genre, it manages to be entertaining throughout its lengthy campaign.\nMastering the careful balancing act of cost versus efficiency is at the heart of Railgarde, which casts players in the role of Administrator for the dubious Nakatani Chemicals corporation. A recent arrival to the company’s space colony, your role is to manage the resources at sites and make sure everything is running smoothly across the planet.

          "description": "Over at Eurogamer, I kind of have a thing for LG's Fast IPS screens. This tech combines the best feature of TN panels - their incredibly fast pixel response times - with the traditional advantages of an IPS screen, namely gorgeous colours and wide viewing angles. These screens pop up in LG's 27GL850 and 27GL83A monitors, but are also used in Dell's even better S2721DGFA - and it's this monitor that's on sale today. With a code available here, you can take an extra £30 off a model that's already seen an £80 discount, dropping the price from £380 to £268 - an incredible deal for a monitor of this specification. I used the code $6ZZXZWLF0WV7D, but your code is likely to be different!\nSo what is this specification? Well, the S2721DGFA exists right at the sweet spot for gaming monitors too, with a 27-inch screen size, 2560x1440 resolution and 165Hz refresh rate. This spec is good because it's not too hard to drive, even with a mid-range gaming PC, but you still get a noticeable increase in clarity and fluidity compared to your standard 1080p 60Hz monitors. And with the Fast IPS screen that I was talking about earlier, you have a monitor that's equally well-suited to fast-paced, competitive shooters as it is slower-paced and more atmospheric games from a wide range of genres.\r\n\nI have gone on about the Dell S2721DGFA a few times now, so I'll link to those previous posts so you can find out a little bit more about this monitor - and see how much it used to cost too! Suffice it to say, if you have a look at some reviews you'll see that I'm far from the only fan of this model, so I hope this deal is useful to you! Thanks for joining me once again and I'll see you tomorrow for more deals. \n Read more",

There are, however, plenty of sci-fi people who wield spears and guns and do battle by spending a currency called Cinder, if that's your jam.\nWhether you're new to tabletop strategy or already like bashing miniatures together, the game makes for a perfectly enjoyable time. I just don't know whether it goes beyond \"perfectly enjoyable\" into \"thrilling\", though, and that may be down to its lack of, well, lots of things. Give it time and it may just evolve into a game of serious depth but right now it's a bit too miniature to recommend wholeheartedly.\nRead more",

          "description": "Somewhere at the edges of the galaxy in No Man's Sky lies a large, verdant planet with an abandoned, but functioning, starter ship on it. I left it there in 2016 after discovering a larger ship out in the wilds, but it's a decision that still haunts me to this very day. You see, I was so taken with my new set of wings that I failed to notice it didn't have a functioning hyperdrive attached, which is needed to punch through the atmosphere to visit another solar system. It also turned out that this particular planet didn't have any of the necessary resources to craft a new one either, leaving my only form of escape back in my tiny little starter ship – which, of course, was now nowhere to be seen. I spent hours looking for that little ship, but the planet was so vast that I never saw it again. \nUpcoming aerial survival game Forever Skies doesn't have lots of large planets to lose your only means of transportation in, thankfully. In its Steam Next Fest demo at least, the only things I was able to land my makeshift aircraft on were tiny, rusty platforms perched atop decaying skyscrapers on an Earth ruined by disease and an ecological apocalypse. But that fear of getting stranded somewhere I shouldn't be has never left me, and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't just a teensy bit scared of jumping down from my ship and finding I wasn't able to get back up to it again. \nRead more",

Just like its predecessor, Overwatch 2 is one of the most delicately crafted sensory onslaughts I've experienced in a game.\nGuiding my old favourite heroes through venerable maps like King's Row and Route 66, it's like I never left. In many ways, it feels like I've simply been given a reason to play Overwatch 1 again. Is that enough for a sequel? Is it enough to justify the incredibly confusing, lengthy, and oft-botched process of trying to make Overwatch feel relevant again? I'm not certain it is. But perhaps it should be.\nRead more",

As well as a convenient place to relieve yourself and top up on snacks, these futuristic service stations also house cosmetic surgery bots, operation tables, teleportation booths and more - and they're all overseen by a powerful AI trying to find the best possible future for the human race. As the station's head clerk, you'll debate the ethics of eternal youth and end of life care, while also making sure your station has enough power, stocked shelves and a happy customer base.

Review code didn't arrive until launch day unfortunately, but all week I've been vibrating with anticipation. After spending a handful of hours frolicking with slimes and skipping around Rainbow Island, though, that early dazzle is starting to wear off. Monomi Park’s sequel feels a little too familiar to its predecessor in its early game, and it's put a major downer on my goo-hoovering adventures.\nRead more",

          "description": "Out Of Hands is a fairly \"does what it says on the tin\" title for this, a game where you play a dude who dreams he is made entirely out of hands every night. It also operates as a decent joke, because rather than being out of hands, he, if anything, has too many. So full marks for the name. The game itself is kind of a deckbuilder but not really, and though it also describes itself as a thriller, I can't say my heart rate was raised. In fact, behind the (admittedly very cool) visual style there seems to be a pretty run-of-the-mill \"a girl I liked is no longer in my life and I'm pretty cut up about that\" story. I guess in the full game it might turn out she was murdered, or she mudered the main character, or the main character murdered her - just, some kind of murder, maybe?\nBut in the four demo levels I played recently, it seemed like a pretty normal breakup. I was really excited to give it a go, but in the preview I didn't find the contrast between a face made of squirming hands and the well trodden women-be-leavin' plot to be particularly affective or evocative. The squirming hands are cool, though.\nRead more",

That's because you're able to fuse together any monsters you 'catch', but moreso because it's a monster collectathon where you become the monster, essentially fusing yourself with bomb dogs and hermit crabs with traffic cone-homes.\nI like the way the game does away with the overdone shonen story of wanting to become the very best there ever was, and instead puts the spotlight on its cast of characters and the relationships you form with your buds.

          "description": "If you've ever wondered what the 1987 film Running Man might look like as a turn-based tactics game (see also last year's Netflix sensation Squid Game, if the Running Man reference doesn't quite do it for you), then Homicidal All-Stars probably comes pretty close. It's the debut game from Artificer, a new studio formed by a bunch of ex-CreativeForge devs who worked on the first Hard West and Phantom Doctrine, and it centres on a woman called Scarlett who finds herself competing in the deadly TV show that gives the game its name. Like Running Man, Squid Game and all those other 'deadly games' you know and love, Homicidal All-Stars is about folks who down on their luck fighting for their lives, where their only consolation prize in these dystopian bloodbaths is not getting pulped at the end of it. \nFor Scarlett, this means mowing down scumbags in classic turn-based fashion with a bunch of other friendly competitors she's teamed up with, but this is far from a straightforward XCOM-like. Between fights, you'll also be navigating its trap-filled arenas in third-person, dodging sniper turrets, disabling tripwires, and dashing over spiky/fiery/horrible pits to get to the end of each 'episode'. It's a refreshing mix based on an early preview build I've been playing recently, especially when its gameshow hook allows for its malicious host, Orion Ford, to start meddling with your success. \"He’s the person behind the worst of the twists,\" creative director and Artificer CEO Kacper Szymczak tells me. \"He’ll start filling the level with poisonous gas, he’ll turn off the lights, drop explosive barrels everywhere, to name just a few.\"\nRead more",

          "description": "It's tough making a story where you establish early on that your main character will still be alive at the end. In The Excavation Of Hob's Barrow, a point and click, small town, folk horror adventure game, the events are narrated by the main character Thomasina, writing in the future, and the game walks a slightly different line. Rather than successfully making you believe a character you know survives is in peril, all the way through The Excavation Of Hob's Barrow you are aware that Thomasina in the future is alive but, somehow, definitely not okay. And you believe you can save her anyway.\nThis looming dread, growing increasingly loom as the game goes on, is one of the most effective weapons in Hob's Barrows' arsenal of horror. Thomasina, a barrow-digger and proto-feminist trouser-wearer in a time when trousers were worn by men, is a practical and mostly cheerful woman. She approaches all the puzzles she has to solve in the robust, roll-your-sleeves up manner of an old-timey governess who doesn't care if you hate learning French verbs. The Thomasina of the future voiceover, however, sounds blank, drained and sad. It's a contrast that weighs more and more heavy as you slice into the horrible heart of Hob's Barrow, and it underscores how great it is to play the game in its fully voiced form.\nAs well as the voice acting, Hob's Barrow has an appropriately creepsome soundtrack, making fabulous use of the juddering bass tones that put all humans and related monkeys automatically on edge, and isn't a stranger to unsettling lighting. Evil in this game is a sick purple. Most of all, some praise should be especially given to the several horrible close-ups that pop up: Thomasina's eyes, wide in shock, a malevolent cat as he crawls onto your bed; round eyes over a slack, downturned mouth with little peg teeth in it. Devs Cloak And Dagger Games can coax extraordinary depth and motion from their pixel-art and then use that to repulse you.\n Read more",

          "description": "The RPS squad has once again made the trek to London for EGX 2022. There was plenty to see at this year’s show and, as always, we ran some of our own booths. The first was the Steam Deck Zone filled with thirty of Valve’s handhelds full of games for anyone to pull up a chair and play. The second was a showcase of weird and wonderful controllers including an incredibly inconvenient pool table, a digital plant that would grow by controlling light, and a game where you use a keyboard as a tie. \nAlongside those, the RPS gang were exploring the show floor and here you’ll find highlights of what we saw, who we chatted to, what we played, and just general show shenanigans. Enjoy!\nRead more",

There’s a few notable tweaks to MultiVersus in the patch, including a major change to XP between levels 3 and 15. You’ll need twice as much now.

Where the original offers a more traditional top-down view where you're avoiding cops' attention by dodging cones of vision, Serial Cleaners sprinkles different characters and abilities into the mix, alongside a visual revamp that ups more than just the aesthetics.

Valve themselves have the case covered, including a decent hard case with even the cheapest 64GB models, and it’s not difficult to pick up one of the best microSD cards for the Steam Deck. Otherwise, and especially with delays to Valve’s official dock, there’s not much out there from the usual PC hardware suppliers.\nI therefore turned to the makers and sellers of Etsy, where a kind of indie Steam Deck accessory market has emerged. Soon, I’d bought (with my own money, you’re welcome ReedPop) a selection of unique, handcrafted, sometimes questionable gadgets and appendages, and promptly packed them onto a train for independent appraisal by a newly minted Steam Deck owner. Specifically, RPS vid bud Liam.\nRead more",

          "description": "Press F for a Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare sequel\nConsidering the series has been around for a few decades at this point, Call of Duty has had to reinvent itself over and over to keep bringing players fresh concepts. The games have covered concepts from the first World War all the way to futuristic space combat, and some were received better than others, to say the least. Now that the series has started cycling back through classic CoD eras like World War II and the modern day, I guess I should have realized that the franchise would be returning to some of their other, less beloved concepts too.\nAs of a report from known (and often right) Call of Duty leaker Ralph Valve, Sledgehammer's upcoming 2025 CoD title will be a sequel to Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, which was originally released back in 2014. Valve also reports that Sledgehammer's next game was supposed to be a follow-up to the World War II-themed Vanguard, which didn't end up selling enough copies to warrant a sequel in its wake.\nAdvanced Warfare is certainly well-known, although a lot of that has to do with the now infamous \"press F to pay respects\" sequence. The gameplay allowed for increased mobility in gameplay thanks to the introduction of Exoskeleton armor, and fans seemed to like it enough before the series went fully futuristic with the near universally-disliked Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare that came out in 2016.\nAlthough I have three different CoD titles under my belt now, I'm still getting to know the series, especially when it comes to the games with modern or futuristic settings. I guess if Valve's report is correct, then it's worth me going back to play some of the old games just to get a sense. From what I hear, though, I will definitely be steering clear of Call of Duty: Ghosts.\nThe post Sledgehammer’s next Call of Duty game will reportedly bring back Advanced Warfare appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Tequila Works' horror game is not going down with the ship\nThe news of Google Stadia's closure had an immediate effect on several developers. But it looks like Tequila Works and its horror game Gylt will be lasting beyond Stadia's closure.\nGylt was first released in November 2019 as a Google Stadia exclusive. In a new blog on the studio's website, the team confirms that Gylt will be heading to new platforms.\n\"Spooky season is around the corner... And we bring terrific news!\" reads the quick update. \"We've been working on it for a long time and it's finally time to make it official: Gylt is going multiplatform in 2023!\"\nNo details about which platforms that entails have been released yet. Tequila Works suggest staying tuned to its social media channels for updates and news.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQo5XI2Xqog\nA Gylt trip\nThis is great news for Tequila Works fans who never got around to this particular project. The makers of Rime and The Sexy Brutale make some really cool-looking games, but Gylt was one of the notable exclusives Google nabbed for Stadia.\nAt least in this case, Gylt will not be riding off into the night. Hopefully we get some news soon about what platforms it will be coming to next year.\nMeanwhile, other developers are trying to figure out their own solutions to Stadia's closure. Google announced the service is going down last week, confirming that it plans to refund users as well. The cloud streaming service for playing games launched in 2019, and has since seen competition rise from sources like Microsoft's xCloud.\nThe announcement came as a shock to some developers, who were still planning to bring games to the platform. Companies like Ubisoft, Bungie, and IO Interactive have all confirmed they're looking into methods of helping players who want to keep playing their games.\nThe post Stadia exclusive Gylt is going multiplatform in 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Everyone relates with a sad trombone\nA couple of times a year, a \"Phenomenon Game\" pops up out of nowhere and is suddenly the talk of the town. Trombone Champ fits that description. It became a viral meme seemingly overnight, but this genius comedy game didn't come from nowhere. The people who made Trombone Champ had to stick with it for three difficult years, working only on nights and weekends, to put it all together.\nThe game was created by industry veterans Dan and Jackie Vecchitto. They've been self-publishing games for about a decade, and most of their projects have been free. Trombone Champ is actually the first title they've ever sold on Steam, so you can imagine their surprise when it went on to sell 20,000+ copies in its launch window, prompting NBC, The New York Times, and the CBC to all come calling for interviews.\n[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOaYsW-Q1lU[/embed]\nMuch to my surprise, they were also willing to talk to me for my Talking to Women about Videogames podcast (also on iTunes and Spotify). It's a small-time show by NBC standards, but since they had an OK time on Sup, Holmes (an interview live stream show for game devs I used to do), I guess they didn't mind coming back for another talk eight years later. I've been rooting for these two ever since then, long before I knew they were the people who made Trombone Champ, and it's been so great to see those roots grow into a tree made of trombones, thousands of dollars, and mainstream media attention.\nWe got into all that plus the couple's love of Star Trek, D&D, gnomes, my theories on the autobiographical nature of their gameography, and a lot more. Thanks again to Dan and Jackie for taking the time, and doing it on video to boot. It was (ahem) a \"hoot.\"\nThe post Meet the people who made Trombone Champ appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Get ready to battle some bosses\nDead Cells is widely regarded as one of the best roguelike games out there, and one of the best indie games of the past decade. It's one of those games you can play over and over again -- literally -- but for fans who are itching for something new, well, the Dead Cells dev team has you covered. The studio behind the game, Motion Twin, along with their subsidiary studio Evil Empire, announced an all-new Boss Rush mode as an add-on for the PC version of Dead Cells.\nThe idea is that players will have four unique stages to play through, and each stage has the player going up against bosses from the game back-to-back. The breakdown of stages goes like this: stage one has three bosses, stage two has five bosses, stage three has three enhanced bosses, and stage four has five enhanced bosses.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCaZwowMm78\nThe enhanced bosses are new for the Boss Rush mode, and as you might expect, they have ways to make their already-intense battles even harder, like healing powers or allies that come and join them in the fight. If you've played through some of the harder heats in Hades, think of the enhanced boss stages like runs where you're only fighting Extreme Measures bosses.\nEach stage also features Dead Cells bosses randomly selected from Tiers 1, 2, or 3, to which they are assigned based on how difficult they are -- so at least you won't be fighting The Queen five times in a row. The Boss Rush mode is accessible in-game through a door in the basement of the Prisoners' Quarters. Players will also win some serious loot as they defeat the different stages, with the type of prizes scaling depending on how many bosses they fight, which bosses they fight, and so on.\nThe Boss Rush mode is available now in Dead Cells for PC players, and will be coming to consoles later this month.\nThe post Dead Cells got a new Boss Rush update, and it’s out now on PC appeared first on Destructoid.",

[Slider] Animal Crossing: New Horizons Paradise Mix and Splatoon 3 Deep Cut performances. Based on the YouTube description, the concert is scheduled to go on for roughly one hour. To be clear, Nintendo has clarified that \"both performances will be in Japanese without localized subtitles.\" You may recall that Nintendo has done various forms of K.K. Slider and Splatoon idol performances in the past, so this is mainly continuing that trend.\nIt's good to see Animal Crossing back in the fold in some form, as the great rush of billions of amiibo figures/cards seems to be at an end, alongside of major New Horizons updates. Splatoon 3 of course just came out, and alongside of regular free updates and Splatfests, will have a nice little footprint going into the holiday season.\nIt's also a nice way to see the newest Splatoon trio in action, given how popular the past characters have been!\nWatch the Nintendo Live Animal Crossing and Splatoon 3 concerts here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNTvlGj8IUs\nThe post Nintendo is holding several online concerts this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

But the voice actor of the series' protagonist won't be returning for Bayonetta 3.\nIn an interview with Game Informer for its cover story on Bayonetta 3, Platinum Games confirms that Hellena Taylor, the voice actress of Bayonetta in the first two games, is not returning for the third.\nFans had speculated this may be the case, but now Platinum has made it clear. Rather than Taylor, Bayonetta will be voiced by popular voice actor Jennifer Hale.\n\"Various overlapping circumstances made it difficult for Hellena Taylor to reprise her role,\" said game director Yusuke Miyata to Game Informer. \"We held auditions to cast the new voice of Bayonetta and offered the role to Jennifer Hale, whom we felt was a good match for the character. I understand the concerns some fans have about the voice change at this point in the series, but Jennifer's performance was way beyond what we could have imagined. I'm confident that her portrayal of Bayonetta will exceed our fans' expectations.\"\nBayonetta's voice actor for the Japanese VO will still be Atsuko Tanaka.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOGJGv6OoXA\nA new voice in the fray\nJennifer Hale is well-known for her work on several different game franchises, ranging from Rivet in Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart and Ashe in Overwatch to perhaps her most well-known role as Commander Shepard in the Mass Effect trilogy. There's little question that Platinum got someone talented to fill the shoes (gun-heels?) of Bayonetta.\nWhether Hale fits as well as Taylor did for Bayonetta or not is the question. GI's coverage seems positive on the change, commending Hale's portrayal as being \"sometimes indistinguishable\" from Taylor's work in the first two games. But if you want to find out yourself, you'll have to wait until later this month.\nBayonetta 3 goes live for Nintendo Switch on October 28.\nThe post Bayonetta will be voiced by Jennifer Hale in Bayonetta 3 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Capcom teases that more will be revealed in the coming weeks, and there's still \"free title updates\" slated for 2023. We're still unsure on the scope of what 2023 will bring, but so far the free title updates have injected more life into the game: which technically began with the launch of Rise in March of 2021.\nTypically, on Switch, these patches will run around 0.6GB-1GB in size, and will add all sorts of quality of life features (including new guild card pages or awards), and bug fixes.

Both PS5 and Xbox Series X|S console versions of Kakarot are on the way with some shiny new graphics options.\nThese versions will launch on January 13, 2023, right near the start of the new year. For those who already have Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, Bandai Namco Entertainment will have a free upgrade path. Physical versions of the newer generation title will also be in the works.\nAs for the features, faster loading times and fluid gameplay up to 60 FPS are what Bandai Namco's got in store. There are also new visual details. The in-game card game Card Warriors will also be available as an offline version, for solo play.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAW8DAEJWp0\nDragon Ball Z: Kakarot will be available as just the standalone Standard Edition, or with the Deluxe or Legendary Edition, which include some of the post-launch DLC for Kakarot. Deluxe buyers get the first Season Pass, while Legendary buyers get the first and second Season Pass.\nRock the dragon\nThis action-RPG-ish take on Goku's journey will be just about two years old when the newer generation versions hit, and it's received a fair bit of support. As mentioned before, there are two Season Passes worth of content, plus more DLC that apparently features Goku's dad Bardock on the way.\nBut if 2D fighting games are more your Dragon Ball flavor, there's still some good news on the way. It was confirmed at Evo 2022 that Dragon Ball FighterZ will be getting PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions, with rollback netcode on the way too.

          "description": "Live service titles are an exception\nPlayStation Studios' head Hermen Hulst has noted that he expects future PlayStation titles to enjoy at least a year's exclusivity on home console platforms before making the jump to PC — The former Guerrilla Games managing director made the comments in an interview with journalist Julien Chieze.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXSyAfNuvg8&t=432s\n\"I think, going forward, we’ll see at least a year between releases on PlayStation and on the PC platform, possibly with the exception of live service games,\" said Hulst when asked about the recent range of PC ports. \"Live service games are a little bit different in nature because you want to have a strong community, strong engagement right away, right when you go live. So we might, in the case of our live service offerings, go day and date with PC and the PlayStation platform.\"\nThe Steam community has recently enjoyed a wide variety of previously considered PlayStation exclusives, including stellar releases such as God of War; Marvel's Spider-Man and its follow-up Miles Morales; Horizon Zero Dawn; as well as games from Naughty Dog's best-selling Uncharted franchise. Rumors also abound that Housemarque's PS5 sci-fi smash, Returnal, is also en route to the Steam platform.\nGiven Hulst's comments, it seems that PlayStation continues in its commitment to bringing its best-sellers to the PC audience but, understandably, wishes to give its loyal PS4/PS5 community priority. So while Steam fans will have to sit on their hands a little, they can be sure their patience will pay off.\nPlayStation games will wait ‘at least a year’ before their PC release, except for live service titles [VGC]\nThe post PlayStation games to retain a year of exclusivity before porting to PC appeared first on Destructoid.",

Well, with the Street Fighter 6 beta creeping round the corner, we're starting to see some much-needed changes.\nFrom notes written in the Ranked Mode menu screen, we can ascertain that Street Fighter 6 will once again see players win and lose points in online battles, as they progress through eight recognizable tiers: Rookie, Iron (new), Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, and Master.

It'll work just like prior My Nintendo contests, where folks can spend 10 Platinum Points for an entry, up to three entries.\nAs a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked.\nHere is what the My Nintendo Rabbids prize lot entails:\nRabbid Mario Figurine\nRabbid Peach Figurine\nSet of 3 lithographs\nSpark Plush\nArtbook\nSpark Phone Ring Holder\nStickers Sheet\nThe post This My Nintendo Rabbids Sparks of Hope prize pack is pretty cute appeared first on Destructoid.",

When I was in middle school, we had one of those Snakes Alive! organizations come and do an educational demonstration. I guess I didn't look as scared or grossed out as the other kids, because the host called me up and handed me a black snake, who then found his way into the pocket of my hoodie. It was adorable.\nThat said, I don't think I would ever own a reptile, but I love looking at cute snake videos as much as the next person. That's why it was such a treat to log into Twitter today and see that someone had taught their pet snake how to play Pokémon Go. I didn't know you could even train a snake to do such a thing, but I'm so, so glad that this person did.\nhttps://twitter.com/SnakeHour/status/1577043448750047232\nThe tweet was from an account called @SnakeHour (which posts snake content on the hour every hour for all your snake content needs), but the original video is a TikTok from user @maudespaperwinggallery. It features the snake's owner holding them up in front of a phone that has Pokémon Go open, and the snake then uses their little nose to launch Poké Balls at what appears to be a Combee. What really tops off the whole thing for me is the classic Pokémon anime theme song playing over the video.\nNow I want to know — does the snake have their own account? Does their owner take them outside on Pokémon-catching adventures? Which Team did they join? Most importantly: did they ever end up catching the Combee? It's likely we won't get any more information about this scaly little guy or gal, as is the way of the internet, but they will forever live on in my heart.\nGood luck, you sweet little Pokémon master.\nThe post Someone taught their snake how to play Pokémon Go appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Anybody need a hug?\nNow considered one of the best indie titles of 2020, Spiritfarer is one of the coziest and most heartfelt games out there. If you haven't played it yet, it's a definite must if you ask me, and now you can play it right on your phone — if you have Netflix, that is. That's right, Spiritfarer is the next banger of a game that has been added to the streaming company's games library, along with Oxenfree and Moonlighter, to name a few.\nSpiritfarer has players take on the role of Stella, a young girl who is to become the new Spiritfarer, or a figure who helps the souls of those who have passed and escorts them safely to the afterlife. It sounds bleak, but it's actually one of the most whimsical, touching, and comforting takes on death I've seen. The gameplay includes cooking, gardening, gathering materials, upgrading your boat, and giving hugs to those who might need them.\nhttps://twitter.com/netflixgeeked/status/1535317620710420480?lang=en\nLike I said, it's one of the best simulators out there, and it's a smart move for Netflix to grab such a beloved game to help bring players to their platform. The company is going harder on its gaming venture than ever before, having recently announced that it has its own internal studios working to develop original IPs. Netflix also let us know about a new partnership with mobile games publisher Tilting Point, who has helped bring cooking game Spongebob: Get Cooking and an upcoming Narcos-themed game to the platform.\nIt's a hard push, and after the closure of Google's Stadia in the past few weeks, it'll be interesting to see how Netflix fares in an already hyper-competitive market. The difference could be made in their dedication to creating their own titles in addition to games we already know and love, after all.\nThe post Spiritfarer is the newest addition to Netflix’s mobile lineup appeared first on Destructoid.",

Ken will step into his new guise as the Soaring Falcon Ranger, while Cammy becomes the Stinging Crane Range, complete with a brand new projectile attack!\n\n \nAs with Ryu and Chunners' Power Rangers pseudonyms, the new designs for Ken and Cammy reflect the colors and costumes of their Street Fighter iterations, freshly tweaked to fit within the bodysuited battleverse of the long-running Saban franchise. Ken appears to be sleeveless in his ranger gear, which must be borderline heresy to the Power Rangers community. Cammy is instantly recognizable, and even has a red metal beret sculpted directly into her battle helmet.\n\nKen and Cammy stand around six inches in height and feature full articulation, allowing them to be posed in all manner of dynamic stances. In addition, the figures come with various effect elements, so they can be displayed performing their unique, special attacks.

It was the first new real IP from Blizzard in a long time, and from beta through the first few years, it was widely beloved by many, and even lead to a burgeoning (though late) eSports scene. But then the troubles started.\nOverwatch became staler as the team re-used the same events, and slowed with new hero releases. Critical team members left, and Blizzard was turned upside-down by some egregious activities at the company. Many games at Blizzard, Overwatch included, haven't recovered from everything that happened.\nCan Overwatch 2 bring the series back into the forefront? Well, it depends on a few things.\n\nOverwatch 2 (PC [reviewed], PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X)\nDeveloper: Blizzard\nPublisher:…",

Halt\nPublisher Sega and developer Relic Entertainment have announced that the incoming strategy sequel Company of Heroes 3 has been hit with a delay and will no longer meet its November release date — It is now rescheduled to launch on PC on February 23, 2023.\nSpeaking in a statement on Twitter, the development team said that it believes the military sequel is not quite up to the standards expected of the team or the player community, and will be using the additional four months for additional development time, stamping out bugs, tweaking balance, and further polishing visual elements of the final product. Company of Heroes 3 had previously taken steps to revitalize its build following feedback from a beta period, which took place in November of last year.\nhttps://twitter.com/CompanyOfHeroes/status/1577297241894789124?s=20&t=3DZZoaA22NyOmP1nlLlPxw\nShowing remarkable restraint for video game fans, the Company of Heroes community reacted to news of the day with positive patience, asking Relic to continue with their work in hopes of delivering the greatest entry in the acclaimed series to date. CoH 3 is set against the backdrop of the Italian and African theaters of World War II, and will feature all of the scalpel-precise, point-balancing, tactical action of the previous games, complete with a whole new environmental destruction engine and several new visual effect improvements. Additionally, players will be able to pause the action and queue up multiple maneuvers — allowing plans to be executed in real time when gameplay resumes.\nCompany of Heroes 3 will launch February 23, 2023 on PC.

          "description": "Bawk Bawk where are my Vans?\nThanks to a fantastic tweet from user itsybatsy, the ska ska Chocobo theme can now be shared with the masses. You can listen to it below. Then listen to it again. And again.\nIn case you're wondering: it's from Final Fantasy Record Keeper, which came out roughly eight years ago. Sadly, the game is no longer active, as service ended globally on September 29. But that hasn't stopped folks from sharing their memories of the game, including some Record Keeper exclusive aesthetics and songs. Record Keeper actually has multiple versions of the Chocobo theme, including this fiddle-related sampling, and more traditional versions.\nKnowing that there's a ska version of the Chocobo theme that now needs to be preserved wholly by fans is really sad: and speaks to the transient nature of mobile-only games. While we haven't exited the era of endless-mobile-games-as-a-service-only-to-be-shutdown-a-few-years-later; they're still prevalent, and many of them have some really cool moments of creativity like this song.\nIdeally, we can preserve a lot of them through various means like clipping parts of it and posting them on social media. While Record Keeper had fundamental issues, stuff like this deserves to be remembered. Hearing different takes on classic tracks almost never gets old.\nhttps://twitter.com/itsybatsy/status/1575985961980563456\nThe post The ska version of the Final Fantasy Chocobo theme slaps appeared first on Destructoid.",

Agent 47's new undertaking is now aiming to launch on January 26, 2023.\nA new blog from IO Interactive details the roadmap ahead for Hitman 3: Freelancer, in a series it's calling Road to Freelancer. The Hitman developer plans for several updates between now and January 26, including a closed technical test.\nOn October 6, a new patch and roadmap will arrive for Hitman 3. Another update on October 27 will have details about when the Hitman 3: Freelancer closed technical test will start and how to get access.\nThen, in November, IO plans to host the test. More updates will arrive between then and January 26, when the game mode goes live.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otBhG8ZldvQ\nFreelancer was originally planned for earlier this year, but has faced a few delays along the way. Hitman 3 has still been seeing some content roll out though, with its latest location Ambrose Island dropping in July.\nA new way to play\nThe upcoming Freelancer mode is being billed as a roguelike adaptation of the Hitman formula. In it, Agent 47 will have a safehouse and series of contracts to carry out. Loadouts and mission planning can be set up in advance, and equipment can be acquired or lost in the field.\nThis mode seems like a way to not just test out veteran Hitman players, but to add some interesting wrinkles and challenges to the existing map pool. IO says today that it's pushed beyond its initial scope for Freelancer to include \"almost all locations\" from the World of Assassination trilogy on day one. It's also going to be a free update for Hitman 3 owners.\nSo if you've got Hitman 3 on PC via Steam, you might be able to hop into the Freelancer test. Otherwise, it's headed to Hitman 3 owners on January 26, 2023.\nThe post Hitman 3’s roguelike Freelancer mode moves to January appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Last week, Google announced it plans to shut down Stadia on January 18. One of the less-discussed casualties of the news was that Tequila Works’ Gylt, a horror adventure game and the first Stadia-exclusive title, would disappear entirely. Thankfully, that won’t be the case.\nTequila Works has confirmed that it plans to make Gylt multiplatform in 2023. It doesn’t specify which platforms the game will become available on, but it’s a relief to know that one of Stadia’s few original gems won’t be lost to history. \n🎃 We bring terrific news: GYLT is going multiplatform in 2023! More info to come in the upcoming months.https://t.co/ON1pbiGsB9 pic.twitter.com/2sWdseym2G\nOctober 4, 2022\nGylt launched in November 2019 alongside Stadia. It stars a young girl named Sally who searches for her missing cousin across a town haunted by evil spirits. The narrative also serves a commentary on bullying and depresssion. The game’s vibe and art direction evoke films like Coraline or Tim Burton’s animated works and channels games like Inside and Silent Hill. Gameplay emphasizes stealth, with players using a flashlight to defeat enemies. Despite its more innocent veneer, the game has its share of genuinely creepy moments, and I personally found it to be an enjoyable horror romp.\nWill you be checking out Gylt before Stadia shuts down or wait to play it elsewhere next year?

          "description": "Sony announced its new gaming loyalty program, PlayStation Stars, back in July, and the service is now live in North and South America. PlayStation users can sign up for the free program, but there’s one big caveat.\nPlayStation Stars allows players to earn points and digital collectibles by completing “campaigns,” which range from completing small objectives while playing games to larger monthly challenges. Any PlayStation player can join Stars; you don’t need a Plus subscription. \nCompleting campaigns also raises your Star Status, a leveling system consisting of four ranks. Everyone begins at Level 1, but doing things like purchasing games from PSN or earning a certain number of trophy rarities raises this level, increasing the quality of rewards you earn. \nDigital rewards, which Sony confirmed are not NFTs and cannot be resold, include models of old PlayStation consoles and characters from first-party titles. You can also redeem points to use as funds for your digital store wallet and to purchase DLC. Points remain available for 24 months after earning them. \nIf you’re running to sign up now, there’s already a waitlist to join PS Stars. Sony states that new users will have to wait about two months after the date they register to be accepted into the program. It's unclear why this is the case, but one could assume Sony doesn't want to be flooded with too many memberships at once as it gradually gets the program off the ground. Registration also doesn't seem consistent yet, as some folks were immediately let in while others have been told to wait (and some others still can't access Stars in parts of the U.S. as of publishing). \nPlayStation Stars will launch in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand next week on October 13. To learn more about the program, including its handy FAQ, you can visit its official site here.",

Likely the most crucial moment to readers of Game Informer was the debut of the Nintendo Entertainment System.\nThe NES pulled the burgeoning industry out of the “video game crash” and introduced countless iconic characters and franchises. It seemed like every hit property received a game at the time. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Top Gun, DuckTales, Dungeons & Dragons, American Gladiators: the list goes on and on. However, one iconic brand shockingly never made the transition into a NES game.\nGarbage Pail Kids, which also debuted in 1985, was a trading card series that mixed the cuteness of the hit Cabbage Patch Kid…",

But it is a new image showcasing our first look at the famed plumber in the Mushroom Kingdom of this movie, which is being made by Minions studio Illumination Entertainment. This image accompanies the announcement of a Nintendo Direct happening this Thursday, October 6, all about the movie. Nintendo specifically points out that there will be no video game news, however, so don't expect anything more than Super Mario Bros. \nTune in at 1:05 p.m. PT on 10/6 for a #NintendoDirect: The Super Mario Bros. Movie presentation introducing the world premiere trailer for the upcoming film (no game information will be featured).\nhttps://t.co/I868SmSpV2 pic.twitter.com/hqlO0SfLbe\nOctober 4, 2022\nHere's a better look at it, too, courtesy of the film's first poster:\nAs you can see, this image reveals quite a lot. There's Toad, an antiques stall selling relics of Mario's past video games, plenty of pipes and platforms, and of course, Princess Peach's castle high above the rest of the kingdom. There's probably plenty more to glean from the image so have at it. \nThis image is our first look at the movie, but during the Direct on Thursday, which begins at 1:05 p.m. Pacific/4:05 p.m. Eastern, Nintendo will formally introduce the movie with the first-ever world premiere trailer, so be sure to tune in. \nSuper Mario Bros. hits theaters on April 7, 2023.\nWhile waiting for this Thursday direct, read about how Nintendo is reportedly happy with the film and so happy, that additional Nintendo movies are likely on the way. Read about how Chris Pratt says his Mario voice is \"unlike anything you've heard in the Mario world\". After that, then check out this story about how a producer from the movie says Mario won't have an Italian accent in the film. \nWhat do you think Chris Pratt's Mario will sound like?

According to Hulst, \"further investments in areas that will strengthen the expansion on to PC, on to mobile, and into live services\" is definitely a possibility for PlayStation. \n\n\nHowever, more interesting to From Software fans perhaps is Hulst's answer when asked about Sony's investment in the studio. \n\"You should think of collaborations on the game development side first and foremost, but it's also not unthinkable with our PlayStation Productions efforts that we explore opportunities,\" he said. \nWhile Sony has a 14.09% stake in From Software, that's not quite enough to make decisions independent of the studio's other investors, like Tencent, which acquired 16.25% of From Software around the same time Sony invested. So while PlayStation Productions might be interested in a Bloodborne horror movie one day or an Elden Ring TV series about Jar Bairn, for example, From Software and its other investors would likely need to give the green light as well. Here's hoping, though, because From Software's properties, be it Bloodborne, Elden Ring, Dark Souls, or something else, seem ripe for an on-screen adaptation. \nWhile waiting to see if anything comes of this, read about how Bloober Team is making a TV series adaptation and then read about how Sony is developing God of War, Gran Turismo, and Horizon screen adaptations after that. \n[Source: Reuters]\nWhat is your dream From Software movie or TV series?

The line also includes baseball caps, canvas tote bags, a necktie, and a hand-embroidered Sonic patch for blazers and other clothing items.\nYou can see a gallery of some of the items in the collection below.\n\nAccording to Jack Carlson, founder and creative director of Rowing Blazers, which has done collaborations with FILA, Umbro, the NBA, and more, the company's creations all hold important links to his personal life.\n\"A lot of it has to do with the things I loved growing up: the sports, the brands, the culture,\" he said in a press release. \"I grew up in the '90s playing Sonic the Hedgehog on the Sega Genesis. Sonic has always been such an interesting character to me. In the original games, he was a little bit brash, a little bit punk. He was different from other cartoon and video game protagonists. He was very '90s. Of course, there have been a lot of Sonic clothing capsules created over the years. I wanted to do something elevated, really beautifully made, and kind of timeless in its aesthetic. Of course, there's a kind of irony to it because Sonic himself isn't really very preppy, but that's the fun of it.\"\nThe collection retails as low as $38 to $325, though nothing is currently listed at the higher end of that spectrum just yet. The collection is live now, having launched yesterday. If you'd like to check out the collection for yourself, you can head here.",

          "description": "Google has revealed that its cloud-streaming games service, Stadia, will shut down early next year. \nMore specifically, Stadia will close down its platform and end its online servers on January 18, 2023. After that, you won't be able to access the Stadia service in any way. As for your games and hardware, Google is offering refunds \"for all Stadia hardware purchases (Stadia controllers, Founders Edition, Premiere Edition, and Play and Watch with Google TV packages) through the Stadia store,\" according to an FAQ posted by Google today. It seems like the only aspect of Stadia that won't be refunded are Stadia Pro subscriptions. However, you \"will be able to continue playing your games in Pro without further charges until the final wind down date.\" \nIf you are hoping to get a refund for your hardware, Google says \"most hardware purchases...made directly from Google\" will not require you to return your hardware. The company intends to have the majority of refunds processed by Stadia's January 18 shutdown date. \nThe Stadia Store and all its functions have been turned off so you will not be able to make any more Stadia-related purchases or in-game transactions. \nStadia shutting down isn't the most surprising news. Despite cloud gaming's continuing rise in popularity as of late thanks to the likes of Microsoft's Xbox Cloud Gaming initiative and others, Stadia never seemed to really take off. The first big sign that Stadia might not be long for this world came back in February of last year, when Google revealed it was ending its first-party game development and closing two studios. Then, this February, word got out that Google Stadia had reportedly been deprioritized by the company. Now, Stadia has just a few months left in it before it becomes a part of history. So long, Stadia. \nDid you use Stadia? What do you think of this news? Let us know in the comments below!",

It was delayed to at least March 2020 after that, but things went quiet and the game missed that window. Then, in May of last year, Ubisoft announced that Skull and Bones would release sometime between April 1, 2022, and March 31, 2023. And now, it's slipping out of its November 8 release date, which was only just announced back in July, into a new March 9, 2023 date. As for why, the team cites a need for more polish and balancing.\nKotaku's Ethan Gach says sources say the teams working on Skull and Bones are burnt out. According to Gach in his Kotaku story, the latest technical test for the game ended on September 19. One source involved with the test told Kotaku that gameplay was more refined than in previous tests but that progression needed work as it still felt too shallow. Gach writes that this is a concern shared by multiple sources close to the game's development. \nHere's what Ubisoft has to say about the delay: \nThe last the public saw of Skull and Bones in a big way was during a July showcase, which is where we saw extensive gameplay and received the now-delayed November 8 release date. I learned a lot more about the game around the same time when Skull and Bones was Game Informer's cover story. At the time, the team seemed confident in its November release date but given the history of this title, I'm not surprised it's been delayed again. \nAre you excited to play Skull and Bones next March?

Titles like Fortnite and Warzone have popularized collaborations with major brands like Dragon Ball Super, Attack On Titan, and Snoop Dogg, so I was curious if the Overwatch team would consider it. \n\"We've seen some really fun examples out there of games working with other brands or other games,\" Spector says. \"I'm a big anime nerd myself. I think it's super cool when I see Naruto appear in Fortnite. I don't even play Fortnite, but that's awesome.

Though officially classified as a “teaser,” it offers nearly two minutes of clips that provide pretty good looks at the upcoming adaptation. \nThe teaser doesn’t reveal a premiere date, but we get to see how Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) survive the post-apocalyptic world, scenes of humanity's collapse a la the game's prologue, and a quick glimpse of a Clicker. \n\n\nThe Last of Us is led by Craig Mazin of Chernobyl fame and Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann. We learned during Summer Game Fest that Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson, who portray Joel and Ellie in the games, will have unspecified roles in the series. The Last of Us will be available to stream exclusively on HBO Max in 2023.\nTo help prepare fans for what's to come, Naughty Dog recently released a remake of the first game dubbed The Last of Us Part 1.

We now know the dates of the event as well as how it will be structured.\nE3 2023 takes place at the Los Angeles Convention Center from Tuesday, June 13 through Friday, June 16. Digital presentations, such as the annual press conferences held by first and third-party publishers, take place a couple of days before, beginning June 11. \nThe ESA also states that the show will feature separate admission days for industry professionals and the general public. E3 Business Days, designated for developers, publishers, and press/media, take place on June 13-15. Media registration opens in December. \nJune 15-16 will host E3 Gamer Days, where fans will be admitted to the show floor. There is no date for public registration at this time. Since E3 first opened its doors to fans in 2017, professionals and the public have largely intermingled for the entirety of the show, which has caused issues in terms of crowd traffic. E3 adopting the same dividing format as events such as Tokyo Game Show should alleviate that problem.   \nAs previously announced, PAX/New York Comic-Con organizer ReedPop will helm E3 2023. The company has promised to make E3 into a \"world class event to serve the global gaming industry.\" The last E3 to take place in-person at the LA Convention Center was in 2019. The 2020 show was canceled due to the pandemic, and the 2021 version was a digital-only show.",

However, the rating did not include any platforms, so it's unclear where this game might land if it actually ends up being a real title. In fact, the rating features little else other than listing Uniana as its publisher. As VGC notes, this company regularly publishes Konami games in South Korea. \nThe publication also notes that Silent Hill: The Short Message might be related to one of various Silent Hill projects reportedly in the works at multiple different studios. VGC reported in February that Konami is planning a revival of the Silent Hill series amidst other reports stating that a Silent Hill 2 remake is in development. \nWhile waiting to hopefully learn more about Silent Hill: The Short Message, read about Silent Hill creator Keiichiro Toyama's new game, Slitterhead. \n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]\nWhat do you want out of a new Silent Hill game?
