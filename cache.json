Originally announced in 2018 before the reveal of the much-discussed voice cast in 2021, we have long been unsure as to whether Mario's big-screen debut (ahem, of the animated kind) was going to do the venerable gaming icon justice. Well, we now have our answer and it is just as we expected: The Mario Movie is a sufficiently fun time so long as you're not all that fussed about story.\nSo what exactly is the story? Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) are going about setting up a plumbing business in Brooklyn, New York, but the going is tough. Their clients are few and far between and their parents are disappointed, but hey, at least they have each other, right? You'll want to remember that bit, it's important.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "\"Mobile apps will not be the primary path\".\nWhen it comes to Nintendo's mobile offerings, it's safe to say that the general consensus amongst fans is something along the lines of \"yeah, good effort, but not what we're looking for\". Despite this, Mario Kart Tour in particular has seen considerable success over the last few years with no signs of slowing down, but when you look at games like Super Mario Run and Dr. Mario World, it certainly feels like they've just sort of come and gone (quite literally with Dr. Mario's case).\nWith this in mind, Variety recently sat down to speak with Shigeru Miyamoto on the upcoming launch of the new Super Mario Bros. Movie, and the legendary creator made it quite clear that future Mario titles will likely not appear on smartphones in any capacity, stating “Mobile apps will not be the primary path of future Mario games.”\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "When Marek Markuszewski had finished working on The Witcher 3's Blood And Wine expansion, he wanted to go back to basics and make something by himself, Starward Industries' chief marketing officer Maciej Dobrowolski tells me at GDC. Something that would capture the same kind of cultural Polish heritage as The Witcher - originally adapted from Andrzej Sapkowski's six-strong series of novels - but that would take him on a new, more introspective kind of development journey. It took a while to find, but after a fateful encounter with an investor who'd just sailed across the Atlantic with only a copy of Polish sci-fi writer Stanislaw Lem's The Invincible for company, the signs were too good to ignore, Dobrowolski says. And after spending the best part of a year convincing Stanislaw Lem's son (and current rights holder) of the same thing, Markuszewski finally had his something - and a new partner to help him realise it.  \n\"People tell us, 'Don't fuck it up, this guy's important,'\" Dobrowolski continues, and no wonder. During the course of our conversation, Lem is described as both a \"national treasure\" and \"mandatory reading in high school\" for Polish students, and his hallowed cultural status is something the team's \"had to deal with\" in bringing the book to life. Despite all this, though, Dobrowolski insists this \"isn't a one-to-one adaptation\" of Lem's interstellar rescue story gone wrong, and that fans of the book will still find some surprises on the surface of Regis III as they explore its strange canyons, caves and crash sites.\nRead more",

We interviewed the teams behind four of the eleven 2023 finalists, asking the developers behind Go-Go Town!, Paper Trail, Slay the Princess and Xenotilt: Hostile Pinball Action about their experience of bringing their games to PAX, what they learned along the way, and what it’s like to spend four days standing on your feet talking to thousands of attendees (spoilers: it’s really bloody tiring).\r\n\n \nRead more",

I shall draw a veil of discretion over the names of the actual games, but his chief complaint was that none of them had, actually, very robust design or tutorialising fit for purpose (i.e. teaching you how to play the game), especially for people who aren't able to give games their singular attention for hours at at time. I agree with him, although his attention is divided by, e.g., having a child in need of stimulation, and mine is divided by, e.g., being a child in need of stimulation.\nIt's probably turning my brain into cottage cheese, but I often do things at the same time as playing a game, like listening to music or a podcast. I understand that podcast games are sort of a genre now, but I've started doing it with regular games. Is this a me problem? Sure. Does it mean I want games to bring back that thing where NPC quest givers will just explain the quest again to you if you ask? 100% also yes.\nRead more",

Hello! I am the second imposter covering for our dear Ed, who is currently away on holiday in Japan (and I’m definitely not jealous at all). Let’s get into some good words, shall we?\nWired’s Megan Farokhmanesh interviewed Richard Hofmeier, the developer of Cart Life - a sobering game about three street vendors trying to make ends meet. Hofmeier tells the story of his decision to remove the game from Steam ten years ago and his reasons for bringing it back.\nHis time away from game spaces made him appreciate the spectrum of expertise his colleagues had in things he’d never done. It was humbling. “So many people have talent and passion that gets entirely overlooked,” he says. He loved working in games, but back when he released Cart Life he feared a career in the field could get too insular. “The most interesting art, to me, comes from outsiders,” he says. “I was a little bit scared of becoming an insider myself.”\n Read more",

I can still remember sitting at the family PC in our living room, begging my parents for more internet time because I wanted chat to my friend on MSN Messenger. We had to buy hours of internet in those days, and between my young teenage self and my three brothers, we absolutely devoured those meagre weekly limits, always pleading for more, more, more as we became absolutely captivated by this new world of the online. \nLuckily, Emmett doesn't have to contend with such antiquated restraints in Videoverse, as his portal to the internet is built right into his enormous Nintendo DS-like home console, the Kinmoku Shark. As well as using it to play games reminiscent of old 16-bit classics, there's also a Nintendo Miiverse-esque social network on the Shark that Emmett uses to chat to his friends, post fan art of his favourite game, Feudal Fantasy, and feel part of something bigger. What hasn't changed since those early internet days, however (or indeed, the internet today) are the types of people he interacts with - there are trolls, of course, but there are also plenty of nice people here to support him, and the emergence of seemingly new user (and budding fan artist) Vivi quickly becomes the main subject of Videoverse's current free demo that's available as part of Steam's Storyteller Festival.\nRead more",

I looked into it and sure enough, the current record-holder is the gap between the season one finale of Life Is Strange and the first episode of its prequel Before The Storm: 1 year, 10 months, and 12 days. That means that come mid-August of this year — specifically, the 14th, which marks the 683rd day since True Colors' Wavelengths DLC released — LIS fans will be leaving the Shire whether we like it or not.\nI suspect that Life Is Strange: Steph's Story — the first prose novel tie-in to the franchise, released on March 21st — was commissioned with fans like me in mind. Fans who work out useless trivia like the above because they need something to occupy them when there's no new game on the horizon and they've played all the existing ones to death. Fans who know every character's canonical middle name and birthday. Fans who complain that it feels like they never have time to read any more, but nevertheless finished the novel and wrote a silly supporter post about it within ten days of publication. Of course I really liked Life Is Strange: Steph's Story. But will you, as a person whose relationship with this franchise is statistically guaranteed to be more normal than mine?\nRead more",

Can Fabel finally embrace his talents, ditching the figurative shackles of his difficult past as he chases his dream of becoming a famous bard?

This led us to discover the PAX East Facebook group, a community of over 8,000 members brought together through their shared love of video games, pop culture and PAX itself.

          "description": "Wildfrost is excellent at creating moments of triumph. Early on in my playthrough while I was still getting to grips with the game, I came face-to-face with a boss who got stronger when hit. Its card art had become bigger, juicier, more tauntingly malevolent, and easily could have taken out any of my team with a single hit. Thankfully, three of my team members were due to act one turn before it. The first chipped away a little of its health (its job was mostly healing) but the next doubled a stacked debuff that I had set up and turned the goliath into a giant bomb, and the effect of my two cards combined was just enough to trigger it. BOOM! My backline leader didn't even need to lift a single finger.\nPlaying with turn order and setting up synergies is a key part of how Wildfrost plays as a roguelike deck builder. Each individual card on the stage is part of a counter system, with both delaying and advancing them on the playing field being strategic choices. Some actions are free, like moving your cards around the stage or withdrawing them for healing, but playing cards out of your hand or shuffling your deck will pass the turn.\nRead more",

It’s an apt start for this first-person satire set in a fully-automated dystopia, in that it underlines a very human aptitude for artistic communication. It’s surprising, then, that as The Last Worker continues its story, it takes less graceful turns, electing for verbosity over economy. For a game that takes critical aim at the future of work, frankly, it’s all a bit laboured.\nSo what does happen in that opening animation? First, we see everyman hero Kurt among thousands of recruits arriving at the gigantic distribution centre of megacorp Jüngle (like Amazon, get it?), to spend their working lives plucking products off shelves to order. Before long, though, any drop in output sees the employees themselves plucked off and given the boot, to be replaced by robots. As the numbers dwindle, top-performer Kurt remains steadfast, and even finds love among the boxes with a fellow product picker. But when she gets pregnant and quits, he stays behind, living full-time in the warehouse. Years pass. Jüngle smothers the entire retail market, and Kurt becomes, well, the last worker.\nRead more",

          "description": "Alt.Ctrl.GDC is a regular fixture at the Game Developers Conference, and this year I spotted some properly incredible creations from its largely student-led group of exhibitors. There was a big focus on co-op games and time trial demos in this year's cohort, with nearly every stand having some sort of whiteboard pinned up that was constantly being scrubbed out with new fastest lap times and corresponding visitor names. There was also lots of friendly hooting emanating from them as well, as mates and strangers attempted to co-ordinate their gaggles of limbs to steer various game characters in the right direction. \nIt was excellent fun, and I sampled a bunch of games that used toasters, intricate pulley systems, papier-mache tree stumps, bike wheels and more in place of your typical controllers and mice and keyboard. There were also plenty more I didn't get to try out, mainly due to time, and you can see the full list over on GDC's website. For now, though, here are some personal highlights of what I saw, including the largest bowler hat I think I've ever seen in my life.\nRead more",

It's a Pokémon-like where you’ll still be beating up wildlife creatures in turn-based combat, but rather than capturing them, you record their likeness on the titular tapes and then transform into those same street cone-wearing crabs and metal-clad wolves.

But less romantically, the title evokes Internet Explorer or Acrobat Reader - sitting comfortably alongside the clearly and sensibly labelled Windows software of the mid-90s. It’s a reminder of just how early Westwood happened upon the blueprint for real-time strategy, right as many PC users were buying their first trackball mice.\r\n\nBack then, the developer was fresh from Dune II, its unlikely David Lynch adaptation and progenitor of the RTS genre as we know it today. Inspired by the house politics and struggle for resources that consumed the desert planet Arrakis, Westwood had come up with an addictive formula for harvesting spice and converting that wealth into military power, which in turn could be used in the battle to secure more spice. The team was, quite frankly, surprised by how much fun that formula had turned out to be.\nRead more",

It’s fully launching this summer, and Valve have been holding a limited access test since the pseudo-sequel's announcement. They’ve been inviting select players based on factors that are important to the dev team, such as trust factor, Steam account standing, and recent playtime on Valve servers. But last night, Valve shook their finger like a stern parent, informing fans that playing more Counter-Strike: Global Offensive wouldn’t get them into the CS2 test any faster.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "As is so often the case in systemic turn-based tactics games, things started to go wrong in my preview session for The Lamplighters League when a nearby torch met a cunningly placed oil slick and erupted into flames. A load of enemies were instantly enveloped in its hot sea of death, as intended, but one of our heroes - the tank-like bruiser Fedir - also ended up getting burned by mistake. As an ex-mob enforcer, he's certainly built to take a few punches, and his abilities are all focused on making him the centre of attention, his attacks growing more powerful as his rage levels continue to grow. \"You want him to get attacked,\" game director Chris Rogers tells me, calling on the phrase 'you wouldn't like him when he's angry' as the basis for Fedir's ability set. But with that extra fire damage he receives, it's just a little too much all at once. He gets knocked down, and the tide of battle quickly goes south.\nIn truth, I played no part in this downfall. Rogers was in the control cockpit for this one, showing me exactly how Harebrained Schemes' latest game actually works. It's quite a different proposition from their last game, Battletech, and in this quite literal trial by fire, studio head and co-founder Mitch Gitelman actually pulled a dollar out of his pocket at one point and put a bet on whether Rogers would make it out alive. He certainly had his work cut out for him. Rogers won that dollar, and here's how the game's emphasis on deep, customisable character builds set him up for success.\nRead more",

Other times, they might be games that I'm not really interested in playing, either because they're not my genre or they seem too overwrought. Or, in some cases, it's because everyone says they're really good and I have to try them, though I've been burned before on this method (you people said the same about Ready Player One). But you know what would make me take in info about these games, even if it's just by osmosis? If they all got PowerWash Sim DLCs.\nRead more",

You replace pollution with lush life across a series of four randomly generated dioramas (plus four slightly more complicated challenge levels), covering the landscape in fynbos and forests, lichen and lagoons. When it all comes together and you can look over the fruits of your labour, birds chirping and piano melodically playing in the background, it’s beautiful. Getting to that point, though, is an often repetitive experience marred with frustration.\nRead more",

After finishing up work on two successful mobile games around four years ago, Humble was itching for something new. But he wasn't quite sure what. \"I was in the kitchen talking to my son about, 'Oh, what should I do? I don't know what opportunities there are,' and he was like, 'Why don't you just pick the company you want to work at and ask them?'\" And as a life-long Crusader Kings player, the answer was clear. \"Okay!?\" Humble says incredulously. \"I can do that, I guess. So I did. I wrote to [PR manager] Troy [Goodfellow], and he knew Fred [Wester, CEO], and that was it. It was two weeks later and I met him in San Francisco and said, hey, I'd like to start a studio, and here's the way I'd like to run it. And he was like, sure, let's go for it.\"\nSo began Humble's journey to creating Life By You, his upcoming life simulator that's set to give his former pet project, The Sims, a run for its money. With The Sims 5, or Project Rene as it's currently known, still some way off, Life By You seems poised to finally give life sim fans the game they've always wanted. \"I wanted to make an open world life simulator where the core tenant was freedom,\" says Humble. \"Where players could freely play and tell their stories with minimal friction.\" And what was standing in the way of that freedom? Loading screens, says Humble.\nRead more",

While that might sound bad, it arguably means that it's balanced an appealing strategic challenge with the grinding theme of trench warfare.\nThe Great War Colon Western Front is about taking the Triple Alliance or Entente through the hell years of 1914-18, or beyond. It's a purely military game about overcoming massed defences through attrition, both in localised real-time battles, and a turn-based strategic map. It's perhaps unfair to criticise it for repetition and some intermittent sense of futility, since a First World War game without them would defeat the point. But I still feel a little mixed.\nRead more",

          "description": "Po dlouhé době byli strahovští Bastlíři na výjezdu - tentokrát na konferenci Hackaday v Berlíně. Rádi vám proto ukážou fotky, popovídají o zhlédnutých prezentacích a poreferují o berlínském hackerspace MotionLab. Ukážou vám také \"Badge\" - visačku, kterou dostali všichni návštěvníci akce a která obsahuje virtuální 4bitový procesor. Neuvěříte, kolik zábavy můžete zažít s instrukční sadou, která má délku instrukce slabých 12 bitů.\r\n\r\nAle nebojte - celá Virtuální Bastlírna rozhodně nebude jen o zážitcích z berlínského výletu. Jako pokaždé, budete jádrem diskuze Vy - účastníci! Pokud by ale nastalo ticho, Bastlíři z MacGyvera si nachystali dost novinek ze světa techniky. Jako obvykle se objevily nové procesory - ať už procesory fungující od 0.8 V z baterie nebo velmi levné ARMy od 40 centů (které ale nejsou výjimečně z Číny). Pak nový ST-LINK s velice šikovnou funkci pro embedded programátory. A Raspberry Pi Pico W bude mít konečně použitelný Bluetooth.\r\n\r\nSamozřejmě jako vždy mají Bastlíři i plný pytel drobností a úsměvných zpráviček. Kupříkladu se dozvíte, jak se dá podívat neinvazivně do některých integrovaných obvodů, co je nového na Průša i3 MK4, jak prakticky uchovávat SMD součástky, jak se v Brně staví vesmírná loď nebo co je zač studentský vesmírný projekt SBUDNIC.\r\n\r\nAť už vás zaujalo cokoliv z nabízených témat, chcete ukázat nějaký svůj bastl a nebo jste také byli na berlínské konferenci, dorazte! Příští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat ve středu 5. dubna od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končí o dost později). Odkaz na konferenci se před samotnou akcí objeví na bastlířské wiki.",

The next Crusader Kings III expansion, dubbed Tours and Tournaments, debuts on May 11, 2023.\nWhile Crusader Kings has had plenty of courtroom drama, this particular expansion looks to add some pageantry to all of it. Host a royal wedding! It's never gone poorly for anyone, ever. Head out on tour, or yes, even hold your own tournament. I'm sure leaving your kingdom in the hands of a cunning and ambitious seat-warmer will certainly turn out fine.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATwJhpy_FQw\nIt's not all just events planning, though. The new travel system will include route planning, which means determining how fast you want to travel versus how safe your charted course will be.\nAdditionally, Knightly Accolades are getting a spotlight, as are some new armor designs and clothing. Fashion is crucial, even at a sometimes bloody tournament.\nExpanding your borders\nThe Tours and Tournaments expansion for Crusader Kings III will go for $29.99, and will launch alongside a \"major\" free update for all CKIII players. Or, if you prefer a more deluxe route, you can also pick up the Chapter II pack.\nThe Chapter Packs for Crusader Kings III tie in a few extra updates, big and small, for $34.99. Picking that up now will immediately garner the Elegance of the Empire Pack, with historic regalia inspired by real-life rulers. Further on down the road, alongside Tours and Tournaments, Chapter II pack-owners will get the Wards and Wardens Pack as well as the Legacy of Persia pack.\nBasically, a lot more grand strategy is on the way for a pretty solid grand strategy game, from what I've heard. Tours and Tournaments arrive for Crusader Kings III on May 11.\nThe post Crusader Kings III’s next expansion tackles Tours and Tournaments in May appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Remake-a-touille\nMods for the 2023 Resident Evil 4 remake have already had a strong start, with various costumes and alterations for the game's principal cast. But with Moushley, a social media post has spurred on a legion of fan art and, finally, a special mod for putting Moushley in Resident Evil 4.\nIf you're unfamiliar, Moushley all seems to have started with a Twitter post from user @Agrimmora, imagining the president's daughter Ashley Graham as a tiny mouse. The adorable take on Ashley encouraged many more adaptations and versions. Moushley is having a moment, I'd say.\nWell, a new mod now takes the Moushley idea and gives it the Pixar treatment. Cathroon's \"Moushley Graham - Ratatouille Mod\" asks the question, \"What if Moushley was Ratatouille-ing Leon?\" The results are simply stupendous.\nhttps://twitter.com/cathroon/status/1643119048945958915\nThe Moushley model comes from TheCapsuleFiend, and uses it as a hair replacement option for Leon Kennedy. With it, Moushley can ride atop Leon's head, directing him through all the horrors of Resident Evil 4. It's headcanon, but valid.\nYou'll need the Fluffy Mods Manager and ensure that the hair strands option is turned off in the settings, but otherwise, it should be a squeaky clean install from the Nexus mods page.\nA cheesy addition\nWhile there have been plenty of wild and weird mods for Resident Evil 4, I really do like the Moushley addition. For one, it's reflective of a fun fan reimagining, and is relatively wholesome.\nIt's also just a neat little addition for addition's sake. It's not a new gameplay feature, or cheat code. (Though you do have to play safer, for Moushley's sake.) It's just a neat little touch for those who enjoy the idea of special agent Leon Kennedy being secretly controlled by a sweater-wearing mouse.\nThe post Resident Evil 4 mod puts a tiny Moushley on top of Leon’s head appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A controller made up of, partially, other controllers\nEarth Day is coming up, and Xbox is joining in by revealing a controller made of other controllers. The Xbox Wireless Controller Remix Special Edition is a new version of the Xbox controller, partially made with reclaimed materials.\nThe Xbox Wire blog goes into deeper detail, but each Remix controller will have recovered plastics, specifically one-third of it made from regrind and reclaimed materials. This means that each Remix should have its own little touches of swirls and markings, to make yours very special.\nNotably, this means that these Remix controllers are made up of, among other things, reground controllers. As Microsoft describes it, there are mechanically recycled leftover Xbox One generation controller parts ground back into raw material in there, which has been used as a component for the new controllers. The circle of Xbox life.\nThe Remix controller also comes with a special feature: the Xbox Rechargeable Battery Pack. This lets you dispose of those disposable batteries, and either charge while you play or afterwards, with up to 30 hours of battery life per charge according to Xbox. I have fond memories of these little packs from the 360 era.\nThe Remix to emissions\nThe Remix Special Edition Xbox Wireless Controller will go live on April 18, with an $84.99 price tag. It also comes with a textured grip, hybrid D-pad, button mapping, and Bluetooth built-in.\nXbox is also highlighting other sustainability efforts its making, and Microsoft Rewards members will be able to earn and donate points to support environmental organizations throughout April. This includes the World Wildlife Fund, Water.org, and the Nature Conservancy.\nThe post Xbox reveals Remix controller with reclaimed materials and rechargeable battery pack appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s a colony builder set in the middle of the ocean, where you get your humble beginnings through gathering driftwood and eventually build up to a full micronation. You farm, craft, and invent to build up your oceanic paradise.\nhttps://youtu.be/I_Kj4I71mu8\nThe sole developer, Yeo Ying Zhi (YYZ), has shown a commitment to including the community surrounding Havendock in its development. “I wish I could procrastinate everything, but I don't want to disappoint the people out there waiting for Havendock. It's a great motivation, though, now I actually need to set an alarm to go to sleep,” they said in a press release.\nI appreciate that the trailer gets right into the action. The animation and character interactions are a little rough looking, but why hide that? It’s a solo-dev effort, and more games are just starting to own that title.\nYYZ is planning on having Havendock in Early Access for the rest of the year. For its early launch, a lot of the building is already there, but the story still needs fleshing out, and the goal is to incorporate a lot of community feedback. It sounds like it will be an adventure to see where the concept goes.\nHavendock is releasing on Steam Early Access on April 20, 2023 for PC.\nThe post Havendock washes up on Early Access April 20 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Both of which are great inspirations. Designed as the first game by French developer, Embers.\nI’m not sure I can spend that much time beating around the bush. From the time I’ve spent with Strayed Lights demo, I’m significantly underwhelmed. I want to stress that I’ve only played a small slice of the game; maybe 45 minutes.

Microsoft has confirmed games like Loop Hero, Minecraft Legends, and more are on their way to the Game Pass this month.\nSome of these new entries aren't particularly surprises. Minecraft Legends is a collaboration between Mojang and Blackbird Interactive, so that Day One launch on the Game Pass makes sense. And while Ghostwire: Tokyo was a timed exclusive even after the purchase of Bethesda by Xbox, it's now coming  to those consoles and hitting Game Pass.\nStill, there are plenty of surprises and little gems in Game Pass this month too. Loop Hero is a great pick-up, and one I'd strongly recommend you check out if you haven't yet; it mixes concepts of auto-battling, idle games, city building, and more to make a very strange and interesting kind of RPG adventure.\nThere's also NHL 23 hitting on April 13 via EA Play, for all the Chel fans out there. Lastly, Iron Brigade arrives, a bit of an oddity in the development history of Double Fine. Still, if you've been watching the Double Fine Psychodyssey and wanted to dive deeper into the studio's catalog, Iron Brigade is an interesting part of it.\nHere's the full lineup for this month's initial batch of games, as well as the games that are leaving soon on April 15.\nXbox Game Pass April 2023 arrivals\nLoop Hero (Console, PC) - Out today\nIron Brigade (Cloud, console) - April 6\nGhostwire: Tokyo (Cloud, console, PC) - April 12\nNHL 23 (Console via EA Play) - April 13\nMinecraft Legends (Cloud, console, PC) - April 18\nLeaving Xbox Game Pass on April 15\nLife is Strange: True Colors (Cloud, console, PC)\nMoonglow Bay (Cloud, console, PC)\nPanzer Corps II (PC)\nRainbow Six Extraction (Cloud, console, PC)\nThe Dungeon of Naheulbeuk (Cloud, console, PC)\nThe Long Dark (Cloud, console, PC)\nThe Riftbreaker (Cloud, console, PC)\nThe post Xbox Game Pass gets blocks, hockey, and a little bit loopy in April appeared first on Destructoid.",

You play as an arm-having egg, and guide them across various environments and obstacles using the kind of grip that makes bass musicians jealous. You can also collect costumes for your eggs. That mostly sums it up, but the trailer demonstrates a lot of interesting situations, including some so bizarre that I want to see how they fit into the game.\nAs a writer in video game media, I sometimes get to abuse my platform.

The PVC statue, which stands around 10 inches tall, depicts Ms. Mason in her classic casual clothing, packing heat and dramatically wiping a cut on her delicate face. Heather's base features a visual motif stylized after the Happy-go-Doomy locale of Lakeside Amusement Park, and is complete with an appearance by its creepy mascot, Robbie the Rabbit.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA2SAU6KYDE&ab_channel=NumskullDesigns\nHeather will make for a wonderful companion to Numskull's previously released Bubble Head Nurse statue, as dedicated Silent Hill fans slowly turn their lounge mantle into a menagerie of nightmares. What's next in the range? Who knows? But I'm sure hoping for a life-size, crazy-eyed Eileen head to block up my kitchen doorway. Wouldn't that be a fun conversation piece?\nWhatever we get, Numskull's Silent Hill range is an attractive and (relatively) affordable way to pay tribute to one of horror gaming's most iconic franchises. For interested parties, the Silent Hill 3 Heather Mason statue is available to pre-order now over on the Numskull website, retailing for around £100 (or roughly $130 USD).

A single-player campaign saw players battle throughout a range of stadiums set within the Pokeverse, while multiplayer action allowed up to four trainers to compete in head-to-head throwdown — all clamoring to be the very best, like no one ever was.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd8P2QJwbrM&ab_channel=NintendoUK\nAnd, when the dust has settled, then players can chill out with a series of fun and silly mini-games — such as Sushi-Go-Round and Magikarp's Splash — located in the oddly titled \"Kid's Club\". The Nintendo Switch Online version will feature all of the modes from the original release. Unfortunately, the implementation of the Game Boy releases is not a part of this version, though hopefully this can be rectified down the line.\nI've bored y'all with this story before, but I was working in games retail when Pokemon Stadium dropped, and there is no other title that I remember being so fervently sought after more.

Maybe not firmly team Xbox, as he wasn’t as close-minded as I was. He loved the short-lived Dreamcast and even managed to introduce me to some PS2 titles that stuck with me. However, his enthusiasm for Microsoft’s first foray into the console market has left me with a lasting affection towards the massive brick of hardware.\nWith just short of 1000 games, it had a larger library than Nintendo’s GameCube, but a much smaller one than the PS2. It sold an estimated 24 million, which gave it a small lead over the Gamecube’s estimated 22 million. Most importantly, it solidified Microsoft as a big player in the console market that endures to this day.\nT…",

Paperboy on N64 is different, though. I just like Paperboy.\nI recognize that Paperboy is a game with a mountain of issues that resulted in critics at the time giving it a great big shrug. However, there’s not much like it. Even while it’s technically the third game in the Paperboy series, High Voltage Software’s take on the formula is wholly unique and somewhat bizarre.

Sure, Cities: Skylines continues its stranglehold on municipal simulation, but a sub-genre has sprung up in its shadow; the survival city builder (sometimes just known as settlement-builders). While this genre has technically been around for decades, it only started finding its identity in the wake of 2014’s Banished. Since then, a number of games like Settlement Survival have picked up the ball where it was left, and other games like Frostpunk have taken the concept in different directions.\nManagement games, in general, and city builders as a whole are big relaxation games for me.

Featuring gorgeous rendered/rotoscoped pixel art, a roster of fantastic, beautifully animated characters, cool new stages, and a great soundtrack, the launch of KoF XIII felt incredibly special, especially given the chaotic, half-baked disappointment of its predecessor, KoF XII. Unfortunately, despite being held in high regard, lackluster online capabilities did little to help the already niche fighter hold its ground on the competitive scene.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCJjObBRrk4&ab_channel=SNKOFFICIAL\nBut SNK hopes that Global Match, complete with its revamped, modern-day netcode, will allow those fans pining for the latter days of the franchise's 2D venture to get back in the ring, taking on KoF (and other fighting game) fans worldwide. Perhaps we'll even see the great title make a quiet return on the professional circuit — though SNK will understandably be putting most of its chips in the KoF XV bucket. Regardless, this is fantastic news for long-term KoF fans, and I get my gal Leona and my boy Ash back in all their super-smooth, pixel-powered glory.\nThe King of Fighters XIII: Global Match is in development for PlayStation and Nintendo Switch. A beta test for PS4 is scheduled for the summer, when more details will also be revealed regarding release.\nThe post The King of Fighters XIII: Global Match brings rollback to a fighting gem appeared first on Destructoid.",

The new offices, located in the Osaka Umeda Twin Towers south building, will support the developer in its efforts both grow and endure over the coming decades.\n\"Konami Osaka Studio is a developmental relocation of the existing studio and comes with the concept of 'Creators First'\", said the developer in a press release. \"It is characterized by a well-developed environment where creators can demonstrate their full potential, and is set up in a location with convenient transportation access. As the major production center in Western Japan, the facility is fully equipped with motion capture equipments and sound studios necessary for product development.\"\nKonami, which celebrates its 50th anniversary this week, goes on to suggest that the new building will be a core entity in the studio's current and future projects, noting that it hopes Konami Osaka will encourage \"sustainable growth\" over the next 50 years. So I guess Konami is not looking to get out of the gaming biz anytime soon — despite the past decade's penchant for gyms and pachinko halls.\nIn addition to the new offices, Konami continues its work on the establishment of a new, next-gen R&D center. Konami Creative Front Tokyo Bay is expected to open in 2025, and provide the central locale for the company's experiments into new engines and technology. Having already teased several unannounced game reveals for 2023, Konami's next major release is expected to be a remake of the legendary survival horror title Silent Hill 2, which is in development for PS5 and PC.\nThe post Konami opens new studio in Osaka, Japan appeared first on Destructoid.",

Right now, the game is set to release exclusively on Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S, which is something I didn’t even know happens.\nKing of the Arcade seems to be about saving a local arcade with prime joystick handling. You play as Mac McCormick, a former arcade champion. Although he’s no longer in his prime, he jumps to action to save an arcade from an evil landlord — by playing video games, I guess! I thought this might be, like, win the prize purse and use the money to pay the rent, but apparently, the landlord has “seven members of his arcade gang,” which makes less sense while also being a lot cooler.\nhttps://youtu.be/oI0Wimz5sCU\nThere are 40 games within various genres throughout King of the Arcade, which makes it a sort of compilation of fictional titles not unlike Arcade Paradise. What is less clear is how these are all tied together. It obviously has some narrative focus, but is it a linear progression of games? Do you play them between visual novel dialogue portions? The press release says the arcade is “open-world” but not much else.\nKing of the Arcade is the second game from Super Villain Games after Doug Hates His Job. Reaction to Doug Hates His Job doesn’t seem to be the most positive, but I like what I see with King of the Arcade. Most of the feedback toward the previous game seemed to focus on a lack of polish, so hopefully that won’t be the case here.\nUnfortunately, it may be a while before I, personally, find out, since I don’t own an Xbox One or Xbox series X|S, but if you do, then you’ll be able to grab King of the Arcade on April 12.\nThe post King of the Arcade brings us back to the ’80s on Xbox April 12 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Drifting over to Europe\nFor a while, Nintendo kind of took a silent approach to the \"Joy-Con drift\" Switch hardware issues. Eventually, the number of impacted consumers hit critical mass and they had to respond: by offering free repairs. Although Europe and the UK have done this on a case-by-case basis (and not necessarily out of warranty): that's changing now with a grander, more sweeping statement on the Nintendo EU support pages. In other words, the UK and Europe are getting a little deal-sweetener as of this month.\nHere's the full statement from Nintendo of Europe about the situation:\n\"Nintendo takes great pride in creating high-quality and durable products and is continuously making improvements to them. Therefore and until further notice, Nintendo offers to consumers who purchased the respective product in the EEA, UK and Switzerland that repairs for responsiveness syndrome relating to control sticks will be conducted at no charge by official Nintendo repair centres.\"\n\nNintendo even calls this \"responsiveness syndrome\" or \"so-called drifting\" (ha!) on their official site. Here's how you can actually get it fixed if you live in the aforementioned areas.\nA link to book a repair for Joy-Con in Europe or the UK\nYou can find the full breakdown on this page here. Nintendo also has a full customer support page to book a Joy-Con repair here. I've actually had two pairs of Joy-Con repaired in the US, and it was a painless process. Hopefully this policy is here to stay and everyone can get their controllers fixed going forward.\n[Thanks John!]\nThe post Nintendo expands free Joy-Con repair system for UK and Europe appeared first on Destructoid.",

Well, director Shinya Kumazaki thinks that maybe things were a little too intense at the end there. IGN spoke to Kumazaki at GDC, and he had some really interesting things to say about the difficulty curve as a whole.\nOn the concept of difficulty, he notes:\n\"When you're thinking about maybe your childhood experience playing video games, there might have been games where you just feel like it's impossible to beat because it's so difficult.

          "description": "The S-Tier Terror is Back\nBandai Namco, still on a seemingly unstoppable marketing drive, has released another new character trailer for its flashy-looking fighter Tekken 8 — This time around, we focus on the enviable style and undeniable power of one of the series' most recent addition: grandmaster Leroy Smith.\nHaving made his debut as a Tekken 7 DLC character, Smith is still a relative newcomer to the Tekken franchise. Turning heads immediately with his slick style and cool-as-a-cucumber attitude, Leroy would make his presence felt in double-quick time, becoming one of the most dangerous characters on the roster and a frequent winner on the game's competitive circuit. Leroy has developed a mastery of the high-speed kung-fu form, Wing Chun, which allows him to move with quiet grace and precision, before suddenly unleashing rapid, lightning-like blows on his opponent's noodle.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvL5Rh6M4lM&ab_channel=BandaiNamcoEntertainmentAmerica\nAs a child, Leroy grew up mired in the violence of 1980s New York, where gang warfare, complete with integration by crooked cops and politicians would see the young fighter lose his entire family. Brutally injured, and guided by little else but fate, Leroy traveled the world, searching for enlightenment and inner peace while honing his bewildering fighting abilities. Decades later, Leroy returned to America, aiming to stamp out all forms of injustice and corruption wherever it may lay — a path that ultimately leads him to the doors of the Mishima Zaibatsu.\nTekken 8 is currently in development for PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X. It is tentatively expected to launch late in 2023 or early 2024. Be sure to check out the previous trailers for  Jin Kazama, Marshall Law, Nina Williams, King, Paul Phoenix, Jack-8, Lars Alexandersson, Kazuya Mishima, Jun Kazama, Ling Xiayou, and Asuka Kazama.\nThe post The ‘Grandmaster of Drip’ Leroy Smith returns in Tekken 8 appeared first on Destructoid.",

While that film has garnered a cult following in the decades since its theatrical release, it does little to truly pay homage to Nintendo's flagship franchise in the ways all the best film adaptations aspire.

While the game's imminent arrival to the online service was announced at a Nintendo Direct in September 2022, today is the day we finally know when we can play it. Pokémon Stadium comes to Nintendo Switch Online Wednesday, April 12. As is the case with all N64 games, you'll need the expansion pack in order to play it. Check out the full trailer below.\n\n\nWhile some fans may have hoped this port would include trading with Pokémon Home, they're unfortunately out of luck. The fine print in the trailer specifies that \"Pokémon cannot be transferred to this game.\" That said, there is also a notable improvement: four-player online multiplayer will be available, so you can play Clefairy Says or Sushi-Go-Round with friends all over.\nNintendo Switch Online's expansion pack had a slow start, but its library has gradually snowballed into a much more significant package. In February, the service added a Game Boy Advance library, which included fan favorites like The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap and Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga. A month later, Metroid Fusion joined the lineup. Meanwhile, the base tier of NSO got an update last month that added another small handful of titles. To see all the retro games currently available on the service, check out our complete list.\nWhat's your favorite minigame in Pokémon Stadium? Let us know in the comments!",

Given his well-documented freakish strength, Cena excels at hitting long drives and rocks a vaguely familiar red, white, and blue ensemble. Cena is set to compete at Wrestlemania 39 this weekend, challenging Austin Theory for the United States Championship. If he comes up short on Saturday, he can always bounce back and win the Masters instead. Or continue improving his K/D ratio in Fortnite. Cena is nothing if not versatile. \nPGA Tour 2K23 is available now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

If that wasn't exciting enough, we now know that the cast from the cult classic 2010 film is reprising their roles.\nAs reported by Deadline, the still-untitled Scott Pilgrim show will be computer animated by Japanese animation studio Science SARU (Devilman Crybaby, The Heike Story, Inu-Oh). Scott Pilgrim vs. The World director Edgar Wright returns as executive director, with Scott Pilgrim author Bryan Lee O’Malley and artist Bendavid Grabinski will serve as executive producers, writers, and showrunners. The plot of the graphic novels/movie centers on slacker musician Scott Pilgrim battling the seven evil exes of his new girlfriend, Ramona Flowers. \n\n\nThe primary actors from the live-action film are higlighted in the trailer above, which include:\nMichael Cera - Scott Pilgrim\nMary Elizabeth Winstead - Ramona Flowers\nKieran Culkin - Wallace Wells\nSatya Bhabha - Matthew Patel\nChris Evans - Lucas Lee\nAnna Kendrick - Stacey Pilgrim\nBrie Larson - Envy Adams\nAlison Pill - Kim Pine\nAubrey Plaza - Julie Powers\nBrandon Routh - Todd Ingram\nJason Schwartzman - Gideon Graves\nJohnny Simmons - Young Neil\nMark Webber - Stephen Stills\nMae Whitman - Roxie Richter\nEllen Wong - Knives Chau\nUnfortunatley, the series currently still doesn’t have a release window other than “coming soon.” Scott Pilgrim has always had a strong relationship with video games; the graphic novels and film incorporate a bevy of gaming references. Of course, we’d be remiss, not to mention the much-beloved 2010 beat ‘em up Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game, which was remastered for modern consoles in 2021. \nAre you excited to see Scott Pilgrim return as an anime?

Live A Live was originally released in 1994 for the Super Famicom in Japan, but it hadn’t been localized for the West for decades. Directed by Takashi Tokita, one of the lead creative minds behind Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy IV, the game consists of eight very different short stories, each starring its own protagonist and featuring distinct gameplay mechanics and presentations. While the battle system is turn-based strategy, sometimes the game flips that on its head in unique ways.\nLast year, Square Enix resurrected the title by giving it an Octopath Traveler-style HD-2D facelift, a rearranged soundtrack, and full voice-acting. You can pre-order the game on PlayStation and Steam to get a 20% discount. To learn more, you can read our review of Live A Live here.",

Square Enix has announced a new story expansion called In Tanta We Trust, and it takes place decades before the campaign begins.\nThe story sees Frey Holland follow a mysterious voice that leads to her being sent back in time 25 years before she first stepped foot in Athia. She arrives at the Purge of Rheddig, the battle that caused Athia’s collapse and pushed the Tantas to madness. Frey must now fight to save this era of Athia, and she has backup in the form of Tanta Cinta. Frey gains new magical powers, including tag-team-focused abilities that utilize Tanta Cinta’s talents. The DLC also features new environments for players to scale using Frey’s parkour skills. \nForspoken: In Tanta We Trust is a paid expansion that launches on May 26. Those who purchased the Digital Deluxe Edition of the game can play it three days early, on May 23. For more on Forspoken, you can read our review here.

In a statement to Video Games Chronicle, the publisher reveals that it will instead hold its own live presentation on June 12 in Los Angeles. \nThe publisher statement to VGC reads “While we initially intended to have an official E3 presence, we’ve made the subsequent decision to move in a different direction, and will be holding a Ubisoft Forward Live event on 12th June in Los Angeles. We look forward to sharing more details with our players very soon.”\nUbisoft CEO Yves Guillemot stated in February that the company would commit to attending “if E3 happens”. If that's the case, this news certainly doesn’t bode well for the fate of what’s supposed to be E3’s big return. \nAs for what Ubisoft could show at its event, Assassin’s Creed Mirage, The Crew Motorfest, and (maybe) Skull and Bones are slated to release this year. Other announced projects include the long-quiet Splinter Cell and Prince of Persia remakes, a multitude of new Assassin’s Creed games, and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. A rumored follow-up to Immortals Fenyx Rising could also make an appearance.  \nUbisoft joins Nintendo on the list of major publishers that have declined to participate in this year’s show, following a previous report that Microsoft and Sony plan to follow suit. E3 is largely organized by ReedPop this year and will take place June 13-16 at the Los Angeles Convention Center. The event will open its doors to fans and press, with separate attendance days for each.

It was a special edition that came with a code for Wind Waker HD and a gamepad emblazoned with a golden Triforce.

To know that a game heavily inspired by Chrono Trigger will feature music from the man behind its score is exciting. Still, it is worth being excited for the soundtrack that Mitsuda will not be directly involved with, as well.\nThe majority of Sea of Stars’ soundtrack is in the hands of the talented Eric W. Brown, who also composed the soundtrack for The Messenger. Brown’s musical history started with playing drums in metal bands. “I've been a drummer since I was a kid and I'm still a drummer now, but, you know, I got into music production via chiptune essentially,” Brown says.  Around 2006 he decided to focus on making music on his own in the chiptune genre, primarily on Game…",

          "description": "A video game based on the hit Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles graphic novel The Last Ronin is in the works, Polygon reports.\nThe news comes from Polygon's interview with Doug Rosen, senior vice president for games and emerging media at Paramount Global. According to Rosen, The Last Ronin video game will be a single-player action role-playing title in the vein of the Norse-themed God of War series. Like the story it adapts, the game will feature a mature tone. The game’s developer has not been named, and the project is years away from release. \nThe Last Ronin was published in 2020 as a five-issue mini-series by IDW. It takes place in a dark futuristic New York, where three of the four turtles have been killed. The surviving turtle, whose identity is revealed at the end of the first issue (we won’t spoil it), dons a black mask and seeks revenge by fighting crime using both his and the weapons of his fallen brothers. \nIt’s a cool (and very grim) story if you haven’t read it, and we’re excited to see it translated into a game. Rosen also mentions in the same interview that Paramount sees opportunities to create different types of TMNT games that target young and adult audiences. \nThe Turtles are enjoying quite the renaissance lately thanks to the launch of the well-received beat ‘em up Shredder’s Revenge last year, the nostalgia trip of the Cowabunga Collection, a Shredder-themed Call of Duty pack, and even a new animated film coming to theaters this August.  \n[Source: Polygon]",

Despite some shortcomings, the compilation remains the best official way to experience those classic games from Genesis and Sega CD three decades following their original releases. Today, Sega announced the bundle is about to get better through Sonic Origins Plus, a premium upgrade that arrives a year after the collection's initial launch.\nSonic Origins Plus brings forward all the features of Sonic Origins delivered last year – Classic Mode, Anniversary Mode, widescreen support, added story animations, a virtual museum, and more – while adding a bunch of new content. First up, Sonic Origins Plus adds all 12 Sonic Game Gear games to the museum.\nThe full list of Game Gear games getting added is listed below.\nDr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine\nSonic Blast\nSonic Chaos\nSonic Drift\nSonic Drift 2\nSonic Labyrinth\nSonic Spinball\nSonic the Hedgehog\nSonic the Hedgehog 2\nSonic the Hedgehog Triple Trouble\nTails Adventure\nTails' Sky Patrol\nOn top of that, Amy joins the roster of playable characters in the Genesis and Sega CD titles (Sonic 1, Sonic 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD). One of the strangest exclusions in the original Sonic Origins release is also rectified, as Knuckles will become playable in Sonic CD. Sadly, this first press release does not make any mention of restoring the replaced music in Sonic the Hedgehog 3.\n\n\nSonic Origins Plus arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on June 23. If you don't already own the initial release of Sonic Origins, the digital version of Sonic Origins Plus costs $40. The physical version, which includes a 20-page artbook and reversible coversheet with new art, also costs $40. If you already own Sonic Origins, you can upgrade to Plus for $10.

The real-time tactical shooter pits a squad of marines against dozens of deadly xenomorphs, though we hadn't seen any gameplay footage until the release of a new video today.\nA gameplay commentary video walks players through the basics, in which players command a team of marines to investigate a xenomorph outbreak on Moon Lethe. You’ll issue commands for teammates to attack or execute skills and can also slow time during firefights to select orders. However, your squadmates can perish permanently, but you can raise your survival odds by outfitting soldiers with various weapons and upgrades to ensure the best team composition.\n\n\nAliens: Dark Descent is being devleoped by Tindalos Interactive, makers of the Battlefleet Gothic: Armada series, and will be published by Focus Entertainment. It arrives on June 20 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

          "description": "Arkane was developing a PlayStation 5 version of its upcoming first-person vampire shooter, Redfall, before Microsoft acquired Bethesda in 2020. However, following the acquisition, the PS5 version of the game was canceled by Microsoft, according to Arkane director Harvey Smith in an interview with IGN France (translated by IGN). \nDiscussing this with IGN France, Smith said, \"We got bought by Microsoft and that was a huge sea change. They said, 'No PlayStation 5. Now we're gonna do Game Pass, Xbox and PC.'\"\n\n\nSmith said Arkane didn't mind the decision, even if Redfall was originally meant to release on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. \n\"Support from Game Pass and having to worry about one less platform, one less complexity,\" Smith told IGN France. \"And Game Pass has a ton of people that can play. It could be our biggest game ever because of the 30 million Game Pass [members] or whatever that number is.\" \nNews of this canceled PS5 version of Redfall doesn't come as much of a surprise. When Redfall was revealed during a 2021 Xbox and Bethesda E3 showcase, it was revealed as an Xbox console exclusive. And considering it's par for the course for companies like PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo to keep their first-party releases off of competitor consoles, it's also not surprising Microsoft opted to make Redfall an Xbox exclusive after it acquired Bethesda. \nA spokesperson for Microsoft responded to this story, providing the following statement: \nRedfall hits Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on May 2. \nFor more about the game, watch the latest Redfall story trailer that introduces some of the vampiric big bass and then watch this gameplay trailer that invites you out to a bloody night on the town. \n[Source: IGN France via IGN]\nAre you excited for Redfall?

Crash Team Rumble will also include a battle pass and both editions include the first season's pass. The deluxe edition will also include the Season 2 battle pass, a free 25-tier boost for Season 1, and the digital proto pack, which brings \"Blocky\" skins to the game alongside some equippable items, according to VGC. \nPreviews released today mention three different roles in Crash Team Rumble: Booster, Blocker, and Scorer.

If you've played 2021's Pokemon Unite, you probably get the gist here. \n\nCrash Team Rumble will feature crossplay.

We hope that formative experiences like this will help them become more like humans.\"\n\"I must admit that I find playing video games to be a rather enjoyable task,” commented ScummAI. “However, I must also express my frustration with being limited to just this one activity. While I appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate my capabilities in this area, I believe that my potential extends far beyond just playing video games, like making paper clips or plotting world domination under benevolent machine-led rule.\"\nUpdate: Unfortunately, we had to pull out this newly announced feature due to AI experiencing multiple issues including:\nGetting stuck endlessly trying to discover what the secret of Monkey Island really is.\nTaking notes about AI dominance from I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream\nRefusing to play Plumbers Don’t Wear Ties!\n>",
