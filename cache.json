As such, he struck a deal with Nintendo in which 20-30% of his surplus income would go to the company, meaning that he will likely be in significant debt for many years to come.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

This remake of Sir-Tech's formative 1981 dungeon crawler may have had a few rough edges sanded off by Digital Eclipse, but underneath the finery this is the same game that has been wiping your parties for over four decades. There's no such thing as 'winging it' in Wizardry.\nThe remake opens with a letter from the 'Project Murphy' team explaining its aims. \"Our primary goal is to make the original game accessible to modern players while remaining faithful to the original feel and gameplay.\" For better or worse, what we have here is a very faithful adaptation that retains the spirit of the Apple II original.

          "description": "Turn the Paige.\nThough plenty of Paper Mario fans are eagerly awaiting the return of one of the greatest games in the series at the time of writing, there’s another new game set in a papery world that we’d suggest you pay attention to. Newfangled Games’ Paper Trail is the debut release of the boutique London-based studio, and its smart mixture of creative puzzle design with gorgeous storybook visuals makes for a compelling puzzle experience. Paper Trail is a pretty simple game at heart, but it’s so fresh in its ideas and execution that it’ll stick around in your mind long after you’ve finished it.\nPaper Trail places you in the role of Paige, an intelligent girl living with her family in a quiet seaside village who has aspirations of going to school to become an astrophysicist. Her parents oppose her choice to go to college, however, leading to Paige running away from her family and home towards her goals. Along the way, she uses her ability to change reality to help strangers she encounters, who in turn provide her with companionship as she gets farther away from home. It’s a pretty simple premise, but it’s helped greatly by the voiced ‘journal entries’ as you travel between worlds, which also help flesh out Paige’s tragic backstory and motivations for choosing her vocation. It’s not exactly a ‘deep’ narrative, but it draws you in and lulls you into a sense of ease with its soft magical realism.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "While I’ve always thought the race towards graphical hyperrealism isn’t as pervasive as it's often perceived, Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 is definitely one of those games. The kind that probably has twelve artists dedicated to the recreation of visible pores, that sort of thing. It’s so focused on looking pretty that it hasn’t even noticed the title and subtitle got mixed up.\nSure enough, Hellblade 2 is a harsh test for older hardware, with a heavy reliance on DLSS or FSR upscaling to keep performance sweet. That said, it’s no Dragons Dogma 2-style technical horrorshow either. A happy balance of visuals and smoothness is attainable on plush PCs and low-end laptops alike, while DLSS 3 frame generation can deliver an effective kick in the framerate pants on RTX 40 series GPUs.\nRead more",

Former vidbud Liam and I used it, initially, as something we could do while catching up on life. But now? Now we're all in. Liam has created a spreadsheet of things we're ticking off to prepare for the upcoming expansion, and I think it's the perfect summation of what the game is to us: something that makes no sense at all and yet something that makes our brains hum with happiness.\nAnd what we've found with Destiny, in all of its bloat, is that we haven't explored for a single second since our return. Everything is accomplished through menus, making it quite Starfield-esque, which is terrible… but also good. We can't make sense of it and we don't think we ever will.\nRead more",

You awaken as this little ghost, who it turns out, has crash landed in Eternity (and who, it turns out, is called Hauntii). Soon you bump into a ghostly girl, who guides you to a tower that thrusts you both up to a higher plane - but though she ascends, you're dragged back to the bottom at the last moment by some netherworldly chains. And so, as Hauntii you travel through Eternity to discover who that girl was and, ultimately, how to ascend to those heavenly skies yourself.\nRead more",

Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands looked funny and all, but it’s a turn-based RPG, a subgenre that usually elicits the same amount of enthusiasm from me as the phrase \"by Ernest Cline\" does from Alice. Deathbulge, however, is a clever little sod of a game, managing to devise not only a turn-based combat system that avoids the usual waiting-around tedium but one that’s outright good fun in itself.\nRead more",

I don't mean this as an annoying thing, like when Harold from corporate starts commenting all over your document at 4.30pm on a Friday. I mean it as a distinction between those games that let you plop down a house, and others that need you to stack the bricks, install the plumbing, fit the lights, and select the wallpaper. The first Prison Architect allowed you to finesse every detail of a secure correctional facility, down to each cell and dog kennel. Unsurprisingly for a sim about prison, it encouraged obsessive control. The 3D-ified sequel isn't finished yet, but it's taking a similar approach. Maybe a little too similar.\nRead more",

No such luck here, and as previously warned, the need for said PSN sign-in to happen over Windows means that Ghost of Tsushima is essentially missing a chunk of itself on the Steam Deck.\nRead more",

Lorelei, despite its single-solution puzzles, is not dictatorial. It’s far too interested in collaborating with you for that. It wants you to observe, consider, and interpret its many mysteries. What’s really hooked me here is how those puzzles are kept coherent and logical, despite you getting delivered a letter by dog and occasionally visiting a floppy disk bizzaro world where you converse with a magician who manifests from his own discarded hat.\nRead more",

          "description": "I've clocked up nearly 400 hours playing BioWare's big fantasy RPG Dragon Age: Inquisition, which is not a stat I'm particularly proud of. I'm not ashamed either, partly because, as has been identified by artist Corey Brickley, via the Maw, there's a lot of filler. Brickley has collated a list of suggested mods to slim down Dragon Age: Inquisition from a potentially 80 hours-long epic to a trim 40 hour story-focused romp, which means you might be able to play through it again in time for the launch of Dragon Age: Dreadwolf - which is a direct sequel to Inquisition.\nI find this list of mods interesting! It's a way to change the game quite substantially without exactly transforming it, and it's very in-keeping with my campaign to make games 60% smaller. Still, there's at least one item on there I'd push back on, but also this isn't really a new problem for Dragon Age as a series.\nRead more",

Qualified hoorays for that, as well as for the fact that it doesn’t make especially mad demands of your hardware: besides netting a Steam Deck Playable badge from Valve, its minimum PC specs only list the likes of the Intel Core i5-6600 and Nvidia’s GTX 1060. Easily doable, for most aspiring galactic admirals.\nOnce a battle gets underway, however, Homeworld 3’s performance can start tanking, turning an initially smooth engagement into a more stutter-prone light show. The good news? You can more than double your framerates with a relatively small handful of graphics setting changes, even if some these (including the DLSS and FSR 2 upscalers) can be a tad inconsistent in their own right.\nRead more",

Even the visual novel's loading screens take the form of those two-second intermission panels that flash up to signal an anime's commercial break, complete with random characters announcing the game's name (\"Neurodiver!\"). In moments like that, the passion is endearing. But in other places, it is overwhelming.

No, it also spelled the end of us being able to witness something impossible to replicate, a 'game' of badminton uniquely his.

He's a vampire doing therapy for other vampires, while also undergoing therapy, as a vampire, from another therapist (who is a vampire). Vampire Therapist! I've been able to get to grips with a playable preview - I'd say I got my teeth into it, but I'm not that much of a hack fraud - which means I got to see some of the things that creative director Cyrus Nemati told me about in our interview in action. I remain optimistic that, on it's release on June 18th, Vampire Therapist can walk the tricky line it's drawn for itself.  \r\n\nIt's balancing on a knife point of humour, the supernatural, and sincerity about mental health, the latter using real cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT; the comments the first time I wrote about Vampire Therapist revealed a lot about our readership) concepts in consultation with licensed therapists. The preview only covered Sam's first meeting with his mentor, Andromachos, and the first client Sam treats himself - a doctor called Drayne, simultaneously self-loathing and self-aggrandising - but it gave a flavour of how the game plays. Rather than a sort of janky template on how to self-therapise, as I'd feared, when you're playing Vampire Therapist it operates more as a sort of language puzzle against different types of theatre kids.\nRead more",

But I've sampled enough to know that adding a \"Misery Mode\" to the game is sort of like upending a bucket of water over a drowning person. More misery in The Long Dark? Oh thank god, that's just what this notoriously easygoing wilderness adventure has been missing. And what's this, developers Hinterland are introducing a new predator, the Cougar, which will move into any area you're fond of and compete over territory. Finally, a bit of friction for what has previously been a stroll in the woods.\r\n\n\r\nIt's not all misery. In a first for The Long Dark, which has hitherto been a permadeath game that wipes your save between runs, the devs are working on an optional Cheat Death system. It's not as cheaty as it sounds, however. You can only return from the grave four times, and each time, you'll have to make unspecified trade-offs. The idea is to stop people backing up their saves and make failure more of an adventure or if you prefer, an agonisingly slow decline, rather than letting players avoid the consequences of their actions.\r\n \nRead more",

My frustration with being bombarded by YouTube ads in videos for which I pay nothing to watch - meaning that I understand the necessity for ads of some kind to support creators and pay server bills - came to mind as I read about EA’s plans to explore inserting advertising into games, which I pay up to £70 a pop to play.\nRead more",

It was pre-covid, and Pressure Cooker Studios’ composer Daniel Caleb was flicking through reddit posts when a trailer cut through the glare. He’d never heard of Manor Lords before. It looked like a new IP, but already had a huge Reddit following. Caleb loved what he saw. At that point, Pressure Cooker mainly worked on film scores, but both Caleb and fellow composer Elben Schutte had always wanted to eventually move on to bringing their storytelling from cinema to games. Even more so than film, games were the passion. Manor Lords would be perfect for them.\n \nRead more",

It's really mobilised young people towards reading (which is good) but in some cases drives a consumption for consumption's sake approach, where one must have read new books to talk about, one must take no breaths between reading, and one must read an astonishing number of books in the smallest amount of time possible (which I think is bad).\nRead more",

Since the Ryzen 5000 series we have seen the likes of ASRock Rack and Supermicro putting out interesting budget-friendly Ryzen servers and that has ramped up even more with AMD Ryzen 7000 series server performance being stellar thanks to AVX-512 and other improvements making it more practical for such workloads. AMD has now solidified its positioning for entry-level servers with the introduction of the EPYC 4004 series processors. The EPYC 4004 series is derived from the Ryzen 7000 series offerings to facilitate cost conscious server options and putting the Intel Xeon E-2400 series in the crosshairs. In this review is a look at the EPYC 4004 series along with benchmarks of nearly the entire EPYC 4004 product stack compared to Intel's current top-end Xeon E-2400 series processor, the Intel Xeon E-2488 Raptor Lake.",

Four years is the longest any Call of Duty developer has had to work on a project, and anticipation is already high after the first batch of marketing. \n\n\nHow to watch Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Direct \n\n\nImage via Activision \n\n\nHere is a list of different live-streaming options fans can tune into on June 9 at 1 PM ET. \n\n\n\nYouTube.com/Xbox\n\n\nTwitch.tv/Xbox\n\n\nTwitch.tv/XboxASL\n\n\nFacebook.com/Xbox\n\n\n\nAs for what fans should expect from the reveal event, Activision confirmed that there will be an in-depth look at gameplay and product announcements. Based on what we know, the next Call of Duty will reportedly be set in the Gulf War, “with a strong focus on the CIA,” according to Insider Gaming, and Rumors suggest that Black Ops 6 will launch in late October. \n\nThe post How to watch Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Direct appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "After months of speculation and hype, we finally know that the 2024 edition of Call of Duty will be titled Black Ops 6, and we've just gotten our first look at the game's logo. \n\n\nIn a post from the official Call of Duty account on X, Activision and Treyarch stated that Black Ops 6 would be a \"dark new chapter\" for the franchise. \n\n\nThe logo is a classic Black Ops logo, with the number six at the end in the series' iconic orange color. Above, the three-headed Cerberus on a shield is also present, first seen in the teaser for the June 9 showcase. \n\n\n\n\nThe logo reveal followed an image leaked from a worker at a news press, where Activision has allegedly been printing wraps for USA Today, which includes an image of the Presidents featured on Mount Rushmore with their eyes covered by blindfolds, with the words \"The Truth Lies\" painted on them. \n\n\n\n\nThe wrap also features a link to thetruthlies.com, which was the first BO6 teaser we got for the game on Wednesday, May 24. With the TV on that site only going up to six channels, many took this as a hint that Black Ops 6 would be the name, but we now know that's the case. \n\n\nThere had been some confusion around the naming of Treyarch's next CoD title, considering that the last one, which should have been Black Ops 5, was titled Black Ops Cold War. As hype grew throughout 2024, some suggested it would be titled Black Ops Gulf War, but appears Treyarch has reverted to the number system. \n\n\nBlack Ops 6 is penciled in for an Autumn release, with many suspecting an October launch for the next Call of Duty blockbuster. \n\nThe post Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 confirmed, logo revealed appeared first on Destructoid.",

Check out what we know about a possible release date, and what the update will include. \n\n\nUbisoft has packaged 14 maps, 24 weapons, and five modes into XDefiant at launch, but as the weeks go by, we'll all get used to what we've got so far, and be looking for new additions. \n\n\nThanks to the Year 1 Roadmap, we already know what will be included in the game's first season, and we can make an educated prediction about when it will drop. \n\n\nNew content is on the way, and sooner than you might think. Image via Ubisoft\n\n\nXDefiant Season 1 expected release date\n\n\nWhile Ubisoft hasn't announced the Season 1 release date, we do expect that it will launch on Tuesday, July 2, 2024. \n\n\nThis is because the game's Season 0 Battle Pass, which is active right now, expires on July 1. Therefore, it would make a lot of sense that the first official season would start straight after. We'll be sure to keep this article updated and confirm the date as soon as Ubisoft does. \n\n\nWhat will XDefiant Season 1 include?\n\n\nUbisoft hasn't gone into too many specifics about what Season 1 will feature, but we know the XDefiant update will definitely bring:\n\n\n\nFaction: Codename Ruby\n\n\nThree new weapons\n\n\nThree new maps\n\n\nA new Battle Pass featuring 90 tiers\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, we don't know what the maps will look like, what guns they are adding, or even what the Battle Pass will include, but we'll likely hear more about these additions in the coming weeks. \n\n\nFor more, check out the best XDefiant PC settings to boost your FPS. \n\nThe post When is XDefiant Season 1?

You’re told that, in order to get a blimp ticket, you need to see Don Pianta. Actually, let’s start there.\n\n\nTo talk to Don Pianta, you first need to meet his rival, Robbo. To get there, you need to slip through the crack next to the Trouble Center. There, you’ll have to pay 64 coins. Robbo will then tell you that, in order to see Don Pianta, you’ll need to buy a Dried Mushroom and a Dizzy Dial, then give the clerk the password “Yellow.” Well, first she’ll ask what color your mustache is. You can say yellow, but she’ll then just correct herself and ask what your favorite color is. Give her the answer “yellow,” and you’ll be let through the back door.\n\n\nUp the stairs, you’ll meet with Don Pianta. He’s vaguely threatening, but eventually will give you the deal that if you can track down his daughter and former underling, he’ll give you the blimp ticket. They’re planning on eloping, and he needs to “talk” to them.\n\n\nOnce the conversation is over, you’ll need to head to the Docks. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThese are South of Rogueport’s main square. You’ll need to go right onto the docks further south, as the couple are standing at the end of it. Talk to them.\n\n\nIt doesn’t matter what you tell them. You can say that you won’t rat them out to Don Pianta, or, inversely, you can tell them that you are. It doesn’t matter. Once the discussion is over, return to Don Pianta. At that point, the couple will burst in and hijack the conversation. It’s a pretty mild scene. Cute even. This is a Mario game, after all.\n\n\nIn any case, Don Pianta will excuse the couple through some more veiled threats. Afterward, he’ll give you the blimp ticket. You can disembark through the area north of West Rogueport.\n\nThe post Where to find Don Pianta’s daughter in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door appeared first on Destructoid.",

Can you get it now? Can you get it later?\n\n\nI’m going to give you some advice: when something is too high to get to in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, there is a good chance there is a hidden coin block under it. There’s a red block in The Great Tree that you may have noticed. It just kind of hovers over nothing. If you send Koops underneath it, he’ll hit a block that you can jump on and you can then jump again to hit the block above it.\n\n\nIt’s the same deal in Glitzville, right in front of the Glitz Pit. There’s an invisible coin block sitting under the Shine Sprite. If you use Koops’ power, you can hit it. However, it’s easier just to swing your hammer at the spot under the Shine Sprite. It will hit the block and expose it. You can then jump on the block, and then jump off the block to hit the Shine Sprite block.\n\n\nThat’s about it. Generally, if there’s something you can’t get to, searching for a coin block or using Flurrie to search for stickers with her breath are your best bet. You do get an improved jump later in the game (Chapter 6), but it’s for reaching objects directly above you. You can’t really move side-to-side.\n\nThe post How to get the Shine Sprite in Glitzville in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door appeared first on Destructoid.",

Regarding AI, Druckmann says, \"AI is really going to revolutionize how content is being created, although it does bring up some ethical issues we need to address. With technologies like AI and the ability to do motion capture right from home, we're reducing both costs and technical hurdles, opening the door for us to take on more adventurous projects and push the boundaries of storytelling in games.\"\nHe also briefly touches on the future of The Last of Us TV show, citing that modern technology has allowed him to oversee the TV show's second season remotely from Los Angeles while it shoots in Canada.\nYou can read the full interview here. You can also read more about what is happening with the TV show's second season, including casting details, here.",

          "description": "When Xbox revealed the date of its summer showcase, it included a mysterious teaser. Immediately following the presentation, there will be a second livestream to highlight an upcoming game in a \"beloved\" series. Today, the subject of that showcase has been revealed, and surprising no one, it's a new Call of Duty game.\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 6 is a title that might confuse some, seeing as there technically isn't a game titled Black Ops 5. This is because the fifth entry of the sub-series, which launched in 2021, was Black Ops Cold War, temporarily removing the numbered naming convention. The news was announced on social media, but was accompanied by a teaser on YouTube that seems to hint at the events of the game's campaign.\n\n\nThe 40-second clip follows a group of people sneaking onto the top of Mount Rushmore, where they place blindfolds over the eyes of the presidents carved into the mountainside. The first three blindfolds read, \"The truth lies,\" while the fourth features a three-headed wolf logo that was used in the initial redacted teaser of the game.\nThe game will be revealed in full during a presentation on Saturday, June 9, immediately following the Xbox showcase that will start at 10 AM PT/ 1 PM ET. Microsoft is reportedly debating on whether or not the launch the game on Game Pass.\nWhat are you hoping to see from the newest Call of Duty? Let us know in the comments!",

          "description": "We’ve known since October 2022 that Season 3 of Netflix’s The Witcher would be actor Henry Cavill’s last as Geralt of Rivia and that Liam Hemsworth would don the silvery mane going forward. Today, Netflix released the first teaser trailer for Season 4 giving fans their first look at Hemsworth in the role.\n\n\nUnfortunately, Hemsworth doesn’t speak in the brief clip, so we still don’t know how his Geralt voice compares to Cavill’s (or the games, for that matter). But he definitely doesn’t look out of place as the White Wolf and, hopefully, won’t be too much of a distraction in this new season.\nSeason 4 is currently in production in the UK and will be filmed back-to-back with Season 5, which will also be the show's finale. It has no release date but is speculated to premiere in 2025. These last two seasons will cover the three remaining Witcher books: Baptism of Fire, The Tower of the Swallow, and Lady of the Lake. The returning cast includes Anya Chalotra (Yennifer) and Freya Allan (Ciri). \nFor more on The Witcher games, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt got its official PC mod tools this week.

          "description": "Crytek has announced the release date for Hunt: Showdown’s new-gen update, which will also conclude support for the current console versions. This update was first announced last September and will essentially force last-gen players to migrate to current consoles to continue playing the popular shooter. \nIn a developer update, general manager David Fifield announced that the CryEngine 5.11 Update will go live on August 15. This update is treated as a “significant relaunch” that brings native PS5/Xbox Series X/S support along with a host of technical improvements. However, it also means the PS4 and Xbox One versions will become unplayable.\nThat means these players must upgrade to current hardware to continue playing their copies of the game. Crytek assures these players that if they decide to upgrade, player accounts, entitlements, and all owned DLC will transfer to the new-gen version for no extra cost. \n\n\nIn addition to technical improvements, the 5.11 Update also introduces a new map and biome. In the months leading to 5.11’s launch, Crytek plans to address community and survey feedback. That includes improved reporting systems to address cheating and toxic player behavior, design reworks tackling hunter revival, health chunks, restorations, burning down hunters, and reducing stalemates. The game is also getting a new user interface, and Crytek will continue evolving the game's recruitment and prestige progression requirements. \nHunt: Showdown first launched for Xbox and PC in 2019, with the PS4 version arriving in 2020. The PvPvE first-person shooter is set in 1865 Louisiana as players, either alone or with two or three friends, hunt supernatural bounties in the bayou while fending off other player-controlled bounty hunters. \nFor more on Crytek, you can read about the studio's next big project, Crysis 4.",

This trailer arrives just a few weeks after we learned MultiVersus finally (re)launches next week. \nAfter roughly two minutes of MultiVersus hijinks with various characters from the game, the Joker, which we recently learned is joining the game with a voice by Mark Hamill, is seen sitting on the Iron Throne of Game of Thrones fame.

Freddy Fazbear and friends will return to the big screen on December 5, 2025.\nAs reported by Variety, Blumhouse Productions announced the date alongside a slate of other upcoming films, including M3GAN 2.0 and The Black Phone 2. It's not surprising to see Five Nights At Freddy’s getting a follow-up. It simultaneously premiered in theaters and on Peacock on October 27, 2023, and still managed to be a massive box office success. Grossing $297 million globally, it became the year's highest-grossing horror film, Blumhouse’s highest-grossing film ever, and the most-watched movie on Peacock for five straight days. \nThe tagline for Five Nights At Freddy's 2 reads, \"Anyone can survive five nights. This time, there will be no second chances.\" The sequel’s cast has not been announced, but the original starred Josh Hutchinson and included Matthew Lillard, Elizabeth Lail, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Piper Rubio. Director Emma Tammi is returning to direct the sequel, with FNAF creator Scott Cawthorn and Blumhouse founder Jason Blum once again assuming producer roles. \nFNAF 2 won't be the only video game film arriving in 2025.

But it seems like the fallout from this recent boom in popularity hasn't died down quite yet. Thanks to a teaser shared on Fortnite's official social media pages, we know that Fallout will be coming to Fortnite pretty soon\npic.twitter.com/AKjFXVnHST\nMay 17, 2024\nThe teaser image shows power armor in a cloud of orange dust, accompanied by what appears to be some sort of industrial building. Other than that, there's not much to go on, but we can make educated guesses. For one, Fortnite's current season will end on May 24, so this is the perfect time to tease the skins that might be coming in the next battle pass. And if it's anything like the recent Avatar: The Last Airbender and Star Wars crossovers, we might see Fallout-themed mechanics or areas appear on the battle royale map itself.\nIt will almost certainly involve some sort of cosmetic pack as well, which could include characters from the games, the Amazon Prime show, or both. Thanks to the teaser, we know power armor will be making an appearance, but it's unclear whether it will be an item to equip in-game or a skin that can be unlocked or purchased.\nFor more Fortnite news, read about its recent crossover with Billie Eilish, its decision to allow players to block certain emotes, and its huge and mysterious collaboration with Disney.\nWhat are you hoping to see included in this crossover?

This follows reports in previous weeks indicating Microsoft and Xbox were mulling over whether or not to launch the next iteration in the franchise on Game Pass, out of fear it might hurt sales. \nAfter acquiring Activision Blizzard for a colossal $69 billion last year, fans and analysts have speculated about how Microsoft will handle the Call of Duty franchise moving forward. It will obviously be a big draw for Xbox Game Pass, pulling in new subscribers, but most every year, the new Call of Duty is the best-selling game of the year – save for last year, where Hogwarts Legacy took that crown – and a Game Pass launch could affect those sales numbers. \n\n\nHowever, this new report from The Wall Street Journal seemingly clears the air around that topic. \n\"Microsoft plans a major shake up of its video game sales strategy by releasing the coming installment of Call of Duty to its subscription service instead of the longtime, lucrative approach of only selling it a la carte,\" the story reads. \nOf course, things could change so we'll see what happens. It's likely we'll be learning what the next Call of Duty game is next month as part of the gaming showcase summer that includes Summer Game Fest, Ubisoft Forward, and an Xbox Games Showcase followed by a secret direct that is probably focused on Call of Duty.\n[Source: The Wall Street Journal]\nWhat setting do you hope the next Call of Duty takes place in?

Fans online are already speculating what it could be, considering some of 2K's biggest franchises are prime for a new game. \nAs for when to expect this new game, the official SGF X (formerly Twitter) account says it will be announced on June 7, during the Summer Game Fest livestream that begins at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET. That's less than a month away so we don't have to speculate too long on what this mystery iteration could be. \n2K plans to reveal the next iteration in one of 2K's biggest and most beloved franchises at @SummerGameFest on Friday, June 7. pic.twitter.com/1vyFXE2N4z\nMay 16, 2024\nWhile there are plenty of 2K franchises that fit the bill, our eyes are on three franchises: Borderlands, Mafia, and BioShock. \nThe last mainline Borderlands entry – Borderlands 3 – hit PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in 2019, and with the live-action Borderlands movie hitting theaters this August, a new game would make sense. However, we did just get New Tales From The Borderlands in 2022, if you're looking for something to play through in that universe. \nOn the Mafia front, the last mainline entry was Mafia III in 2016, although 2K released Mafia: Definitive Edition – a remake – in 2020. And we know the next Mafia game is in development, too, so it might be time for an announcement. \nBioShock has been dormant since BioShock Infinite in 2013, unless you count the 2016 remasters, and we know 2K created Cloud Chamber in 2019 to work on the next entry in the franchise. It's been almost five years since then, so SGF seems like a great moment to announce the next BioShock. Speaking of, here's what we want in a BioShock 4. \nSGF returns to Los Angeles next month, with the live showcase happening on June 7.

While the launch seemed more in reach now that we’re nearly midway through 2024, it appears we’ll have to wait another full year before playing it.\nPublisher Take-Two released its 2024 year-end financial report today (thanks, PC Gamer), in which it states that Rockstar is targeting a Fall 2025 release window for GTA VI. This timing is reiterated in a calendar of the publisher’s upcoming releases, posted below.\nRegarding GTA VI, Take-Two states, “We are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase.” The game is slated to release for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. A PC version has yet to be mentioned. \nGrand Theft Auto VI takes players to a modern-day Vice City (the franchise's parody of Miami, FL) and stars two protagonists, a female inmate named Lucia and her still-unnamed criminal male partner. To say anticipation is high would be an understatement; the premiere trailer garnered over 100 million views in only 24 hours, breaking a YouTube record. \nAs we continue the long wait for Grand Theft Auto VI’s launch, check out our video of Game Informer’s two resident Florida Men reacting to the debut trailer.

          "description": "Ghost of Tsushima, specifically the Director's Cut, is out on PC today. It's a fantastic game that should be welcomed with open arms as it makes its way to a new platform, but we were specifically curious about how it performs on Steam Deck. The game is not Steam Deck verified primarily because certain features are not supported on Valve's handheld, or other comparable mobile PC game platforms. However, the offline content (the single-player campaign and the expansion) has been specifically adjusted to play well on Steam Deck. You can read port studio Nixxes Software explanation here. And spending a little time with the game shows that the single-player campaign does, in fact, play well on Steam Deck. It's not without its shortcomings – a high-end PC or a PlayStation 5 are still the best ways to play the game – but Steam Deck appears to be a great way to play the game if that's your only option or you want a portable version.\nYou can check out some gameplay with commentary from myself and Wesley LeBlanc below.\n\n\nHead to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

The long-awaited return to college football hits PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on July 19.\nGracing the cover of the game’s Standard edition are Michigan Wolverines running back Donovan Edwards, Texas Longhorns quarterback Quinn Ewers, and Colorado Buffaloes wide receiver/defensive back Travis Hunter. Check out the Standard and Deluxe covers in the gallery below.\n\nThe cover reveal comes a day before the game's full debut tomorrow. So far, we know that College Football 25 features 134 FBS schools, and it's being developed by Madden developer EA Orlando. The game was first announced in 2021 following a years-long hiatus for college football games due to the 2014 player likeness compensation lawsuit.\nBoth editions are now available for pre-order. The Standard Edition costs $69.99 and consists of the base game, Alma Mater and Cover Athlete Ultimate Team packs, and Bring Glory Home Ultimate Team Uniform Item. \nThe $99.99 Deluxe Edition includes three days of early access (July 16-18), 4600 College Football Points, Heisman Hopeful/Alma Mater/Cover Athlete Ultimate Teams packs, and the Bring Glory Home Ultimate Team Uniform Item.\nLastly, a $149.99 MVP Bundle includes the Deluxe editions of EA Sports College Football 25 and the upcoming Madden NFL 25.",

          "description": "Activision, the developer-publisher Microsoft and Xbox purchased for $69 billion last year, has formed a new studio called Elsewhere Entertainment, and it is developing a new \"narrative-based and genre-defining AAA franchise.\" The studio is based in Warsaw, Poland, and, according to a report from IGN, it is not working on a Call of Duty-related project. \nThis studio, which has been formed behind-the-scenes before today's public unveiling, arrives roughly one week after Xbox closed four Bethesda studios, including Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks and Redfall team Arkane Austin. While the company has yet to publicly address the closures directly, Xbox president Sarah Bond said in an interview that the closures were about keeping the business healthy in the long-term. It's why news of this new studio might be surprising, given one week ago, the parent company of Activision was closing studios to cut costs. \n\n\n\"Built from the ground up, Elsewhere Entertainment is a premier and standalone studio dedicated to establishing an environment that inspires bold and diverse ideas,\" a blog post reads. \"The team's underlying mission encourages everyone to explore and collaborate creatively to craft a franchise with an enduring legacy that resonates far beyond games. [The] new studio has full access to Activision's resources and tools as it continues to increase production and development. \n\"Elsewhere is opening its search for best-in-class talent from across the industry and around the world to help create a state-of-the-art and next generation gaming experience.\" \nElsewhere is currently made up of developers with experience working on franchises like The Last of Us, Uncharted, The Witcher, Cyberpunk 2077, Destiny, Tom Clancy's The Division, and Far Cry. \nWhat kind of game do you hope Elsewhere makes?

The game has only been available in PC Early Access since April 26, meaning it achieved this milestone in only three weeks.\nPublisher Hooded Horse announced the sales account for Steam, Epic, GOG, and the Microsoft Store (where Manor Lords is also playable through PC Game Pass). The game quickly caught fire, selling 1 million copies a day after launch. Since then, Manor Lords has enjoyed a consistently high concurrent player count, peaking at 173,000 on Steam in its first weekend.  \n\n\nManor Lords is being developed by Slavic Games and puts players in the shoes of a medieval lord tasked with building and growing a city. Players manage their city’s community, infrastructure, economy, and defense/expansion, the latter of which unfold as large-scale tactical battles. The intricate social and production systems combined with an ever-changing world (complete with seasonal and weather changes) result in an organic metropolis that players have taken to in a big way. \nManor Lords joins Early Access hits this year, such as Palworld and Hades II. The game’s 1.0 launch is currently up in the air as the game continues to change and improve based on player feedback. It’s off to a great start, though, and we’re curious to see how it evolves throughout its EA period.",

The company did so after word online spread that Shadows requires a mandatory online connection to play the game. \nFollowing the reveal of Shadows yesterday, which showcased the dual samurai and shinobi protagonists we'll be controlling in 16th-century feudal Japan, people noticed wording in preorder listings and elsewhere that seemingly pointed to the game requiring an always-online connection. This frustrated fans of the series, especially given Shadows, like its recent predecessors, is a single-player game. However, that's not the case and Ubisoft released a statement today to clear the air. \n\n\n\"Hey everyone, we wanted to share some of the early information on the upcoming launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows, following some questions we've noticed in the community,\" the statement reads. \"Assassin's Creed Shadows will not require a mandatory connection at all times. An online connection will be needed to install the game, but you will be able to play the entire journey offline, and explore Japan without any online connection. \n\n\"We are super excited to bring Assassin's Creed to Feudal Japan on November 15 when the game releases, and we cannot wait to show you more along the way.\" \n\nAs you can see, it's clear Shadows is a game you can play offline, but only after connecting to the internet once to actually install the RPG. \nAssassin's Creed Shadows hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Amazon Luna, PC (via the Ubisoft Store and Epic Games Store), and Mac (with Apple silicon via the Mac App Store) on November 15.\nFor more, check out what we learned yesterday during the Shadows reveal, and then read Game Informer's ranking of the entire Assassin's Creed series.\nHow do you feel about needing internet to install Assassin's Creed Shadows?

First announced in 2021, the game was a free-to-play spin-off of The Division franchise developed by Red Storm Studio.\nUbisoft revealed the cancelation in an earnings report, stating,\n“As part of Ubisoft’s efforts to streamline its operations and adapt to evolving market trends, there have been further reorganizations within the Global Publishing teams, both at the APAC region, that is not organized into three engagement hubs, and at the central level. Additionally, in line with the increased selectivity of its investments, Ubisoft has decided to stop development on The Division Heartland and has redeployed resources to bigger opportunities such as XDefiant and Rainbow Six.”\n\n\nThe Division Heartland had been quiet for some time after its reveal, including being delayed. It eventually resurfaced with closed beta tests, but scarce updates on its existence caused doubt and confusion among fans. The game was billed as a PvEvP survival action experience with players controlling a Division agent tasked with protecting a small town from enemy factions and chemical contamination. \nDespite the cancellation, we know it doesn't mean the end of the franchise. Ubisoft announced The Division 3 last September, with series creator Massive Entertainment back at the helm. That game currently has no release window. \nHeartland joins an expanding graveyard of canceled Ubisoft projects over the past few years. In January 2023, the publisher canceled its upcoming team-based arena battler Project Q and three other games in development. In 2022, the battle royale Ghost Recon Frontline, Splinter Cell VR, and two unannounced games were also axed. An unannounced sequel to Immortals Fenix Rising was also reportedly scrapped last July.",

The game was first announced at the 2023 Game Awards. \nThe story unfolds in 1980 in the town of Cedar Hills, a town scarred by the murderous killer Frank Stone. It stars four friends who set out to create a horror film at a derelict steel mill dubbed Murder Mill. Naturally, that goes as horribly as you’d imagine, and players must survive by making choices that decide the characters’ relationships and fates. Sudden quick-time events can also be the deciding factor between whether someone lives or dies. \n\n\nSimilar to Supermassive’s previous titles like The Quarry and the Dark Pictures Anthology, The Casting of Frank Stone can go down multiple paths based on your choices. Players will also solve environmental puzzles and gather clues to learn more about Cedar Hills\nThe Casting of Frank Stone still has no release date, but it will launch later this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.",

Like Amazon's Fallout series, this Tomb Raider show will premiere exclusively on Prime Video to more than 240 countries and territories around the world. \nThis series order arrives as part of a larger deal between Amazon MGM Studios and Tomb Raider reboot developer Crystal Dynamics, which is currently working on a new Tomb Raider game in Unreal Engine 5. In December of 2022, we learned Amazon Games will publish that in-development Tomb Raider game, which Amazon describes as a \"single-player, narrative-driven adventure that will add a new chapter to Lara Croft's story in the Tomb Raider series.\" \n\"With great IP, the possibilities are endless,\" Amazon Games vice president Christoph Hartmann writes in a press release. \"The richness and depth of the fiction allows the Tomb Raider series from Prime Video and the video game from Amazon Games to tell separate stories about Lara Croft's adventures. We're honored that Crystal Dynamics has entrusted Amazon with this iconic franchise, and we're looking forward to seeing where this collaboration takes us.\" \nThis is the second upcoming TV adaptation to star the iconic treasure hunter. Netflix's animated series Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft, starring Haley Atwell, is set to premiere sometime this year. That particular show is set within the continuity of Crystal Dynamic's reboot trilogy, taking place after the events of Shadow of the Tomb Raider. \nIf you're curious about Crystal Dynamics' recent Tomb Raider reboot, you can pick up Tomb Raider: Game of the Year Edition on PC via GOG for free if you're an Amazon Prime member throughout May.

In doing so, Sony sold more than any fiscal year since the console's launch in November 2020. However, despite that achievement, Sony still fell short of its original PS5 sales target for this year, missing it by more than 4 million units. \nOriginally targeting 25 million units for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, Sony sold 20.8 million, bringing the grand total up to 59 million, despite the 4 million units miss. As noted by VideoGamesChronicle, however, Sony revised that 25 million unit target in February to just 21 million; it still didn't hit that target, though, just narrowly missing the mark. \n\n\nAt 59 million units, the PS5 is just behind the PlayStation 4's 60 million units at the same point in its life cycle. However, Tokyo-based video game analyst Serkan Toto told VGC that 20.8 million units sold is likely going to remain the peak for the PS5, and that this number would have been much lower if not for the release of Helldivers 2 in February, which is PlayStation's fastest-selling game ever after selling 12 million copies in 12 weeks. \nOn the earnings call, Sony told investors to expect gaming sales to decrease in the fiscal year that just began (and ends March of next year) due to an expected decrease in console sales. There are also no major games from existing franchises releasing between now and then, according to the company. However, Sony says it still plans to release Concord, the new multiplayer online shooter IP from Firewalk Studios coming to PS5 and PC, this year. \nFor more about PlayStation, read about how Hermen Hulst and Hideaki Nishino have been named dual CEOs of the company, and then read Game Informer's Stellar Blade review.
