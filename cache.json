Narrated by your AI assistant, Percy Propa (complete with a nasty AI voice, we might add), the trailer explains that Freedom Wars sees you thrown into a dystopian future, where everyone is forced into a life of servitude under a one-million-year prison sentence.

Both games complement each other as flawed but enjoyable examples of Grasshopper Studios' beloved catalogue. An idiosyncratic collaboration between Suda 51 and filmmaker James Gunn, Lollipop Chainsaw highlights the unique style of both creators. It’s a hyper-stylised, quip-heavy action game that remains a uniquely demented experience. Sadly, content omissions and some choppy performance hamper this remaster, tainting the colourful mayhem.\nThe plot is both a perfect representation of its era and a great opportunity to experience Gunn in a goofy horror mode that was stifled when the MCU beckoned. On the morning of her eighteenth birthday, cheerleader Juliet Starling is inconvenienced by a zombie outbreak in her hometown. Luckily, Juliet comes from a long line of zombie hunters, the undead horde is no match for her skills with a chainsaw and a set of pom poms. Unable to save her boyfriend from a bite, Juliet decapitates him and carries his magically animated head on her belt. Together, they must battle through high school and defeat five musically themed dark lords, summoned by an angry goth kid named Swan to end the world.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Paradise is marketed as a third-person game set in a sunny modern city, where you can speak to any NPC via microphone on the street and get stilted responses powered by artificial intelligence. You will supposedly drive sports cars, shoot guns at people, and accrue in-game cash. But its more outlandish claims attracted immediate scrutiny from video creators who found countless inconsistencies in the marketing material. The game has since been removed from the Epic Games Store, presumably for breaking many of the store's rules. But it's still on Steam, and somehow clambering steadily up the wishlist ladder in defiance of its many red flags.\nRead more",

It is, like Dark Souls, a game about equipment and stamina management, but it finds most success as a soulslike in the sensation that you are alone somewhere bad, not able to do very much except hit horrible things in the space between them trying to hit you. It also offers notable moments of lonely, loud footsteps rebounding off cold stone tiles in the seconds after felling some giant man-bastard - one of the subgenre’s greatest un-joys.\nRead more",

Who were these mysterious shufflers, flocking to the deserted, echoing halls of Valve’s disastrous flop like your mate who uses the word ‘liminal’ too much to a dead shopping center?

The peals of celebration travel outward through our atmosphere, exiting the realm of Earthly sound and resonating with interstellar plasma and detritus to form a delicate ripple of comet flakes and stray photons, expanding far beyond our solar system. Where the ripple encounters larger masses, such as planets, suns and... other things, it rebounds, riding the weft of stardust back down to Earth. As it returns home, the signal is modified. Tinkered with. It acquires unsettling harmonics and a guttural undertow.

Look at that capital \"C\", poking out of the middle like the bow on a present whose silhouette leaves nothing to the imagination. You already know broadly what this game involves, yes? Indeed, you do: it's a game about crafting spacecraft, so that you can travel to other planets and craft their resources into other, better spacecraft.

For those blissfully unaware, Gorefield is a version of Jim Davis’s otiose, lasagna-loving housecat who has broken his comic strip shackles and become a cosmic abomination. Gorefield's manifestations are many: centipede Gorefields, arachnid Gorefields, Gorefields that extend serpentine necks of unfleshed bone towards a cowering Jon Arbuckle, demanding to be fed in a voice that sounds nothing like Bill Murray, a voice as deep and velvety as the eternal Monday before the Big Bang.\nIn Gar-Type, a free Gorefield fangame from Youtuber and pixel artist LumpyTouch, Garfield has become a planet. The good news is that, unlike many other Gore-variants, this Gorefield is vulnerable to bullets. It falls to ace pilot Jon Starbuckle and his prototype starfighter, Gar-Type D, to save the Earth from lasagnnihilation.\n Read more",

          "description": "Happy new year all! And what better way to kick off another undignified 12 month crawl toward the next Xmas holiday than with the news that one of my favourite dark fantasy storybook extravaganzas, Ghost Of A Tale, is getting a sequel.\nThe newness of this news is in question, admittedly. Developer Lionel \"Seith\" Gallat and his team have been working on another helping of haunted mouseketeering since 2022. But this is the first time they've properly blogged about it, sharing details of a gruelling switchover to Unreal Engine 5 and a couple of new screens. They still haven't updated the title to make the obvious pun, but perhaps a title as pungent with whimsy as \"Ghost Of A Tail\" is beyond the trumpeted capabilities of Unreal Engine 5.\r\n\r\n \nRead more",

Or at least, it was middling for my own personal taste, which is quite unsavoury at the best of times. Most of my best picks made it into the calendar proper, but a couple didn't. One I hadn't even played properly until after the vote, and the other? The other is a flawed pick, but one that I couldn't stop thinking about.\nAnyway, hope you all have a restful Xmas folks and a cracking new year.

One of the disadvantages of being news editor, you see, is that I have  developed a goldfish-grade attention span. In my hectic pursuit of the next scoop, or the next Elden Ring update changelog, I snatch and cast aside game demos like a pickpocket speedrunning the checkout line at Harvey Nichols. I'm dimly aware that some of these cast-aside games are Very Good. A few might even deserve to be played for longer than 30 minutes. I feel immensely guilty about that. Perhaps a little... existential, too. I have measured out my life in tutorial levels. \r\n\n\r\nSo! Rather than digging out three of the games I've actually completed this year, such as The Crush House, Death Of A Wish and Mask Quest, I'm going to gamble on recommending a few I've barely scratched, but which sure feel excellent and have attracted a positive critical consensus. If I am false in this assessment, may Horace the Endless Bear bite my head off for my impudence. Let's begin.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Instead, I want to talk about mini PCs – not just small-form-factor desktops, but properly tiny, box o’ chocolates-sized computers – which have, of course, been around for decades.\nRecently, however, I’ve been wondering if mini PCs are finally on the cusp of having their moment as serious games machines. Between rising desktop component prices and ever-ballooning electricity bills, it would make sense that a smaller, cheaper system would take on a new appeal, and the success of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally show that convenience still trumps out-and-out performance for a lot of PC players. There have even been hints that Valve are resurrecting their Steam Machine mini PC concept, years after a flopping first attempt. Should you be interested?\nRead more",

Its structure most resembles Songs of Conquest or Heroes of Might and/or Magic, but with little RPG emphasis or base building, and minimal tactical fighting.\nTaxonomy is arbitrary and often unimportant at the end of the day, but I am very glad to firmly rule it out of one category: It's not a bloody card game. It looks like one, sure. You do most things with cards, and characters acquire more cards over time.

My weakest skeletons, sensing their death coming, explode into fire and shards. My strongest skeletons fight so hard and with such alacrity that upon dying, they drag their spirits together and keep fighting as ghosts for a while. Foul little bone scorpions skitter around on fans of legs made from human hands. Somewhere in the middle, almost invisible among the noise, is the character I am actually playing: Path of Exile 2’s mean-spirited, callous, and gleefully enjoyable Witch.\nThis is a review in progress. It has to be. Even in its incomplete early access period, Path of Exile 2 is a great sprawling mass of a game. Three meaty acts of a planned six act campaign are followed by a trickier return tour through them, before the absurd endgame kicks into gear and the real work begins. If I came to you having played everything on offer I would be wild-haired, bloodshot-eyed and possessing perfect, incomprehensible knowledge. Let’s compromise: I have toured the dark caverns and the antediluvian crypts. I have been killed by various accumulated nasties. I’ve had a great time.\nRead more",

Some of the reaction is online toddlers waxing wroth about a video game having a (somewhat older!!!) woman as lead character, and especially, shock, a video game in a series that has hitherto starred a man. And some of it is people commenting more thoughtfully on whether Ciri genuinely makes for a suitable Witcher protagonist, given that she isn't the product of the typical Witcher genetic modification regime (which is heavily tailored towards men), and given that, without spoiling too much, she has gifts that make crumbly old Geralt's sword-and-sorcery skillset look rather paltry. \r\n\n\nSpeaking to Eurogamer this week, game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber responded to a few of these comments, and also shared a little about Ciri's situation at the start of the game.\r\n \nRead more",

We spoke in his home village at dawn. Later, I examined the senator's personal history more thoroughly and discovered he was \"hated by bears for cooking them a rancid meal.\" I suppose every politician has their enemies. \nThat Caves Of Qud creates fun anecdotes out of simple encounters shouldn't be a surprise. It has had 15 years of early access to establish itself as a small-but-mighty story generating roguelike of repute (there's a reason it sits deservedly side-by-side with Dwarf Fortress in the same publishing house). After creating many characters, and dying and dying and dying again, I understand why it grips the brain with such fierce glee. It is a machine of grand imagination and adventuresome comedy. A deceptively powerful RPG that isn't half as obtuse to newcomers as the screenshots make it out to be. Qud's low-res bark is just a complement to its bite.\nRead more",

If you don't have stockings, a fireplace, or a pen, rest easy. I've had a word with Santa's elves, and they say it's permissible to hang a trash bag by your George Foreman grill or local equivalent, and leave a comment on an RPS article instead. Wot you want for Wintermas, then? Extra trash bags? New George Foreman grill? Whatever it is, Santa will provide. If he doesn't, I'll feed him to the Maw.\n Read more",

Heroes in the S tier are considered part of the current meta in OP: Sailing Kingdom and are the best heroes in the game. Those in the A Tier are solid options that you can plug into any team and should be used while you work towards those in the S Tier. Heroes in the B Tier are good choices for the early game as well as for F2P players, while those in the C tier are okay at the start but should be replaced as soon as possible. Finally, any heroes in the D Tier are pretty much just to be used as fodder for upgrading your other heroes.

While the games by the original developers were all terrific, after SNK’s bankruptcy in 2002, things started getting shaky. However, it wasn’t always bad. In fact, depending on your standards, it was rarely bad, and most of the genuinely terrible chapters in its book are from recent attempts to cash in on its fame.\n\n\nIf you want to get into the series, the advice most would give is to play Metal Slug 1, X, and 3, with sometimes …",

Here is where you can find the Cryogenic Canal in Fisch.\n\n\nCryogenic Canal Location\n\n\nThe Cryogenic Canal can be found near Camp 3 at the Northern Summit as part of the Expedition update for Fisch in Roblox. More specifically, you can find the Cryogenic Canal at the coordinates 19875, 578, 5642.\n\n\nThis area serves as one of four new fishing locales in the Northern Expedition, and the Cryogenic Canal specifically has two fishing spots from which you can catch a variety of fish. The canal itself is found inside a cave near Camp 3.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nFull Cryogenic Canal Bestiary\n\n\nIn total there are ten fish unique to the Cryogenic Canal area in the Northern Summit.

To play with the card, you'll have to complete the full SBC set before it expires. Let's take a look at the cheapest way to solve the challenge, and if you should invest your resources in it at all.\n\n\nEA FC 25 Estefania Banini Flashback SBC tasks\n\n\nThe Estefania Banini Flashback SBC has three different tasks, and here are the conditions.\n\n\nTask 1 - Argentina\n\n\n\nMin. 1 Players from: Argentina\n\n\nMin. 1 Players: Team of the Week\n\n\nMin. Team Rating: 81\n\n\n\nTask 2 - 83-Rated Squad\n\n\n\nMin. Team Rating: 83\n\n\n\nTask 3 - 84-Rated Squad\n\n\n\nMin. Team Rating: 84\n\n\n\nEA FC 25 Estefania Banini Flashback SBC solutions\n\n\nHere's a set of solution you can use to complete the latest Flashback SBC in EA FC 25. \n\n\nTask 1 - Argentina\n\n\n\nAny 9 81-rated items\n\n\nAny 83-rated TOTW item\n\n\nCervi 76\n\n\n\nTask 2 - 83-Rated Squad\n\n\n\nAny 11 83-rated items\n\n\n\nTask 3 - 84-Rated Squad\n\n\n\nAny 11 84-rated items\n\n\n\nIf this SBC didn't require a TOTW item, it could have been a good bargain SBC. I am pretty sure that we will soon be getting evolutions that will allow you to upgrade 87-rated items. Banini also offers decent stats, and the rare Half-Winger++ role if you like that. The Technical+ will work well for her body type, as will the Dead Ball, Finesse Shot, and Rapid. \n\n\nHowever, the requirement of a TOTW item makes the SBC more expensive than my liking. You can still complete the challenge for pretty cheap, but it might make more sense to save as much fodder as possible for the upcoming TOTY promo. \n\nThe post EA FC 25 Estefania Banini Flashback SBC solutions appeared first on Destructoid.",

The latest objective is pretty easy to complete, but you'll once again need to don your investigative hats. The first task is to deduce what the mystery nation is before you can complete the objective. \n\n\nDisclaimer: Find out the nation. \n\n\nEA FC 25 Pro Open Mystery Nation objective guide\n\n\nOver the last four weeks of the FC Pro Open tournament, EA Sports has been releasing plenty of Mystery Nation objectives. Let's take a look at tonight's Mystery Nation objective. \n\n\n\nScore three goals using a Finesse Shot with a player from the mystery nation in any UT game mode. The name of the nation will be hinted at during the broadcast of FC Pro Open Matchday 5.\"\n\n\n\n\nThe task is pretty simple: you'll have to deduce what the mystery nation is. Next, use any item from that nation to complete the requirements of the objective. The task can be completed in any Ultimate Team mode, including Friendlies. This makes it easy for all to complete the task and unlock the rewards pretty quickly. \n\n\nBased on the clues handed out in the official stream, the Mystery Nation is Japan. You'll have to use any Japanese item to score three goals with Finesse Shots to complete the objective. As usual, you can do so in a single game, or in multiple contests.

With multiple collaborations ongoing between different games, you can take this charm a step further by making your playing cards look like The Witcher, Dave the Diver, or even Vampire Survivors characters.\n\n\nHow to turn on collab decks in Balatro\n\n\nYou can change the appearance of your Balatro deck by heading into Options, followed by Customize Deck. Here, you'll find categories for each suit, options for high-contrast colors, and arrows to pick between collaboration decks.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nYou can find the same option in your pause menu if you're already mid-run and want to customize your deck. That way, you won't have to leave the game and potentially mess up your current round.\n\n\nAll crossover decks in Balatro\n\n\nCurrently, Balatro has collab decks with 16 other games:\n\n\nSpades\n\n\n\nThe Witcher\n\n\nCyberpunk 2077\n\n\nShovel Knight\n\n\nDon't Starve\n\n\n\nHearts\n\n\n\nAmong Us\n\n\nThe Binding of Isaac\n\n\nCult of the Lamb\n\n\nDivinity: Original Sin 2\n\n\n\nClubs\n\n\n\nVampire Survivors\n\n\nSlay the Spire\n\n\nPotion Craft\n\n\nWarframe\n\n\n\nDiamonds\n\n\n\nDave the Diver\n\n\nStardew Valley\n\n\nEnter the Gungeon\n\n\n1000xRESIST\n\n\n\nSince they're split by suit, you can choose which card types to stay the same and which to swap out. In short, if you love one game but don't have an opinion on the others, you can have one or two enabled and keep the rest off.\n\n\nUnlike decks you unlock through winning runs, using crossover ones won't impact your interest, hands, or discards in any way. They're purely cosmetic, and you can think of them like skins for your decks. You can also use them on any deck type, so you're not limited to using specific ones to see the cards. \n\nThe post How to turn on crossover decks in Balatro appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Despite its status as an absolute banger in the early PC gaming era, the original Doom left a somewhat negative mark on the industry. Along with Mortal Kombat, id software's iconic FPS caused parents and US congressmen to gasp at all that 1990s digital violence. \"Why can't video games offer more intellectual stimulation?\" one might say.\n\n\nWell, wonder no more. As noted by PC Gamer, there's a mod you can get for the OG Doom that will be a feast for art lovers. The Gallery Experience is pretty much what it sounds like, in that it re-imagines the game's E1M1 map as an art gallery.\n\n\n\n\nFeaturing notable works from some of history's most famous artists, the experience lets you walk around admiring great and classic works of fine art, complete with links that will take you to more information on the Met Museum website. Did you know, for example, that Filippino Lippi's Madonna and Child \"evokes the area around the Strozzi villa near Florence?\" Fascinating.\n\n\nA little Shiraz to go with that Baroque?\n\n\nYou can play Doom: The Gallery Experience in your browser over on Itch.io, or you can download it. I chose the former, and I was particularly amused by the fact that Doomguy walks around with a glass of red wine in hand. Now you can appreciate all the pixelated delights of a Botticelli painting while sipping a Bordeaux. How elegant!\n\n\nWhile there are no monsters in the mod, there are items you can pick up as you explore; notably a few hors d'oeuvre and even a bit of cash. All while classical music fills your mind to the brim with sophisticated enrichment.\n\n\nIf you thought Doom could never be paired with words like \"intellectual,\" \"cerebral,\" or \"Renaissance,\" you would be wrong. When you grow tired of mowing down Imps with a chainsaw or firing rockets into the face of a Hell Knight, why not refine your Doom playtime with a trip to an art gallery? It's almost as good as the real thing*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Citation needed.\n\nThe post Explore the more cultured side of Doom with this art gallery mod appeared first on Destructoid.",

It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.
