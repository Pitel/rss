Still, a heads-up a month early was unexpected.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

For those of you only now noticing that tens of thousands of Twitch viewers have been religiously watching video game Hot Wheels, let me elucidate. Deep Dip 2 is a fan-made tower of racetracks that was published as a challenge to the racing game's community last month. It is 16 floors of unfathomably difficult ramps, tunnels, ledges, pipes, and beams. A simple mistake sees drivers plummeting to the bottom, like the sad cauldron man of Getting Over It. The first three players to finish would share a prize pool of over $32,000. Over the weekend, one player has now managed it, and another has since joined him. Third place is still up for grabs but, mate, I wouldn't recommend it.\nRead more",

Dragon Age: The Veilguard - previously Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, strictly speaking Dragon Age 4 - is not the bantzy heist romp suggested by its debut trailer. Less Good News for returning players: going by the 45 minute segment I was shown at Summer Game Fest, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is more of a single-character action-RPG plus entourage, than a proper party-based affair in the vein of 2014's Dragon Age: Inquisition. You do get a party, drawn from a retinue of seven, larger-than-life, romanceable companions encompassing a range of classes, abilities and go-faster hairdos, but control of that party has been streamlined, and there's a God Of Warlike emphasis on booting Fade demons into pits.

It’s not so much a carrying vessel as a hardened second skin, providing protection without all the bag-hogging bulk of a traditional case – while throwing in handy bonuses like a clip-on kickstand and grippy thumbstick covers. For owners of the Asus ROG Ally, the recent launch of a Project Killswitch for their own handheld PC should therefore represent glad tidings with extra gladness, even if it won’t also fit the upcoming ROG Ally X.\nThank the new device’s bigger battery, wider SSD and reworked connection layout for that particular lack of forwards compatibility, as the ROG Ally X’s thicker dimensions will make it just slightly too beefy to slip into the Killswitch’s skintight silicone. A shame, but at least it makes a quality addition to the original Ally right this second.

But one thing has been brought to order: its release date. It's coming to early access on August 14th, while a new trailer (below) shows horse riding, flame throwing, and speed boating.

South Of Midnight seems no less vivid, but a lot more assured in its God Of War-style action... and it's perhaps a bit less intriguing, as a consequence.

          "description": "Computer Artworks' 2002 videogame adaptation of 1982 movie The Thing was a ghoulish and gripping third-person shooter with some terrific mechanics that weren't quite fleshed out, flesh being the operative word. For instance: you can enlist surviving soldiers as squadmates, but are they really surviving soldiers, or are they human-shaped warrens of teeth and mandibles poised to split open and shower you in digestive juices? You have a limited supply of blood tests with which to determine whether any people you rescue are Things in waiting - and even as you're worrying about them, they're casting suspicious eyes at you, care of some embryonic \"trust\" and \"fear\" systems.\nSadly, much of this acute paranoia could be easily gamed out in practice - back in 2002, I deduced that contact with enemies increased the odds of infection, and adopted a policy of shooting anyone who'd been in my squad for too long. But it's the kind of system an intelligent remake could pounce upon and have fun with. Sadly, Nightdive are not working on a remake, like their previous System Shock remakes. They've just announced that they're making a remaster, due later this year. Still, I will take a Thing remaster and thus, the opportunity to write more about The Thing, over no remaster at all.\n Read more",

Simpsons jokes from three decades making up most of my sense of humour, I of course thought it was brilliant. And yet, I couldn’t shake a singular, burning question: What if this, but not joke? Enter Tides Of Tomorrow. Ok, so I actually don't know if it has anything in common with Waterworld aside from having lots of water everywhere. Still, I'll never pass up an opportunity for a crispy Simpsons reference.\n \nRead more",

They are very obviously non-spectral, going by the amount of stabbing and clanging on show in the video.

The hat makes you look like an eraser pencil from Forbidden Planet. It's the kind of headgear worn by the kind of criminal Batman's too grown-up to fight anymore. But it has, nonetheless, roused in this under-dressed stranger a sense of Dionysian frenzy. He will do anything for that hat - hewing your arms off, ripping your intestines out, tearing the skin from your ribcage. And you, in turn, will do anything to rob him of that mattock, because by the gods, it looks a lot more dangerous than the candlestick you're trying to fend him off with.\r\n\n\r\nThere are many such lost souls in the bleak, midnight world of the Half Sword demo - all lurking near candle-lit piles of randomly spawned hammers, stools, barrels, axes and lengths of wood, all subject to unforgivably authentic physics and cursor-based attacks that conspire to transform every scuffle into a Monty Python blooper reel.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Fucksweeper is a difficult game to play in shared accommodation, a very difficult game to play in the crowded airport lounge I'm currently sitting in, and an incredibly difficult game to play on the airplane I will shortly be boarding. What is Fucksweeper? Discerning videogame cognoscente that you are, I feel like you should be able to read the title and form some broad conclusions. But for those who never owned a Windows PC in the 90s, Fucksweeper is a free, titillating, revolting, beautiful, apocalyptic new version of classic avoid-the-bombs grid puzzler Minesweeper that incorporates elements of dating sims and a vast quantity of generative AI filth. Maybe turn down the volume before watching this video.\n Read more",

          "description": "After the climatic end to a decade-long saga in Endwalker, anticipation is high for Final Fantasy XIV’s next expansion, Dawntrail. I got to try out the game and talk to Director Naoki Yoshida (aka Yoshi-P) about new Jobs and the difficulty of incorporating fan feedback (not to mention the reasons the Warrior of Light has such great skin - you'll see). But how can the Square Enix possibly hope to follow the highs of Endwalker, including space travel and a fight against the physical embodiment of sorrow? By taking us on holiday, of course. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Hollywood Animal is a management sim about turning a bankrupt movie studio into a money printing machine, set in Hollywood’s golden age. While a Frostpunk 2 or Manor Lords might have you grapple with the elements, here it’s all about balancing a fickle audience and Tinseltown’s seedy underbelly. Maybe making some worthwhile art, too? Sorry, did I say ‘worthwhile art’? I meant to say “lots of money.” Let’s get clicking!\nFirst up, I need to name my studio (I settle on Horace's Revenge) as well as my crack new team of business bastards. There’s my chief legal officer, Jebediah End. My CCO, Anne Egg, and CFO, Rummy McLastdrink. He doesn’t have a sauce problem, because obviously I wouldn’t put him in charge of money if he did. In the wreckage of the studio, we find an unedited film reel hidden in the waffles n’ cocaine cupboard. It’s a noir thriller named ‘Messenger Of Death’. Whatever influential critic is currently directing this era’s discourse has chosen to categorise each film as genre percentages (‘60% detective/40% thriller’), and setting (‘modern American city’.) Let’s just hope those pigs in the stands recognise a solid gold picture when they see one!\n \nRead more",

In addition to going up to 16 cores versus 8 with the Xeon E-2400 series, the more competitive pricing, the 3D V-Cache SKUs, and 28 PCIe lanes rather than 20, the AMD EPYC 4004 models also support DDR5-5200 memory where as the Intel Raptor Lake E-2400 models are bound to DDR5-4800.

          "description": "BitLife challenges and achievements involving having children can be challenging, especially if you're limited by your starting gender, romantic partners, or other unexpected factors. If you want the difficulty taken right out of these, the Golden Pacifier can help you, allowing you to fly through several challenges.\n\n\nWhere to get the Golden Pacifier in BitLife\n\n\nBitLife's Golden Pacifier is a premium item you purchase through the in-game marketplace. It normally costs $14.99, with occasional sales dropping the price. You can find the store by going into the game's main menu, selecting BitLife Marketplace, and scrolling through until you find the Golden Pacifier.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nIn short, you can only use the item if you pay for it; there is no option to get it for free.\n\n\nWhat does the Golden Pacifier do in BitLife?\n\n\nOnce you buy the Golden Pacifier, you can use it immediately using any of your characters' lives. To activate it, use one of your characters to have a baby. Once you do, you'll find the usual options of deciding whether to keep the baby, alongside a new Golden Pacifier option. Picking this lets you decide your baby's gender, special talent, and whether they'll be twins or triplets. Upon aging up, your babies will be born as you chose them.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe other benefit of the Golden Pacifier is that you can have children during any part of your character's adult life. Typically, females will lose the ability to have children once they reach ages 45-50. However, the Golden Pacifier eliminates this completely, allowing someone of any age, even someone beyond these years, to have a child. It may go against a natural process, but at least you'll have an easier time having kids for any ongoing weekly challenges.\n\nThe post How to get and use the Golden Pacifier in BitLife appeared first on Destructoid.",

This Mythic replicates the character Tank from the hit anime/manhwa series, where you can now control its ferocious powers. Here's how to get and evolve Bear King in Anime Defenders.\n\n\nHow to get Bear King in Anime Defenders\n\n\nYou can get the Bear King by exchanging 2,000 Raid Shards in Anime Defenders. Fortunately, discounts are available to get a significantly lower price. However, players may need to wait a bit, as the Raid Shop does close occasionally.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nPlayers can complete Raids to earn Rain Shards currency through multiple waves. Use powerful units like the Donut Master or Skull Warrior to achieve these challenges quickly. You can also check out our Anime Defenders code guide for exclusive content.\n\n\nHow to evolve Bear King in Anime Defenders \n\n\nTo evolve Bear King in Anime Defenders, acquire the Otherworldly Gauntlet, which costs about 1,000 Raid Shards. Discount prices may also be available, but they are entirely randomized. In the Raid Shop, you can find the Otherworldly Gauntlet next to the Bear King transaction. \n\n\nThen, go to the Summons area and upgrade Bear King via the Evolving hub.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nEvolving the Bear King will transform it into Bear King (Unlocked), a formidable unit on the battlefield. A Shiny version is also available, but it's not always guaranteed. This unit can unleash a ton of damage against enemies, especially with Bear King's Otherworldly Barrage skill and Otherworldly Tackle. Equipping it can propel you up the Anime Defenders' leaderboards, earning you a spot in the Most Kills or Most Power categories.\n\nThe post How to unlock and evolve Bear King in Anime Defenders appeared first on Destructoid.",

The reveal came at this year's Summer Game Fest, and Palworld's community manager, Bucky, detailed his experience at the event on Twitter. While mostly positive, Bucky noted a few encounters painted Palworld as \"the boogeyman\" for some people.  \n\n\nIn his post, Bucky opened with his better experiences at the show, then acknowledged the team is \"more than aware of all the Palworld discourse\" since its launch earlier this year. According to Bucky, claims that Palworld was made with AI, stolen assets, and is the target of a lawsuit are all false. \n\n\nBucky has always been pretty outspoken when it comes to negativity aimed at Palworld. Back in February, he again posted on Twitter to touch on the ‘dying’ game discourse, saying that it’s ‘okay to take breaks’. This time, he’s aired his feelings over what he says were a minority of Summer Game Fest encounters. \n\n\n\n\nFor most of the post, Bucky has nothing but nice things to say about his experience at the convention, from meeting other devs and fans to meeting some of his own personal heroes. He seems to have had a good time, explaining that it was \"great to share stories and advice with others in the industry\"’ as they sometimes feel ‘\"a bit isolated in Japan.\"\n\n\nImage via Pocketpair\n\n\nBucky goes on to promise that Palworld will continue to get bigger and bigger, and the Sakurajima update that’s coming on June 27 is part of that plan. The update will add new Pals, Raids, and Bosses to challenge.

          "description": "The Rebel Moon director’s cut is coming to Netflix on August 2, and when it gets here, it will have a new name. \n\n\nActually, it’ll have two new names. Zack Snyder took to social media today to unveil the release date for his extended double-feature as well as the fresh titles for each chapter of “Rebel Moon.” \n\n\n\n\nChalice of Blood and Curse of Forgiveness are inevitably going to tell the same story as the PG-13 Rebel Moon movies, but fans are still going to have plenty of new things to see. Snyder told Variety that the new movies feature over an hour of extra content, and some of the new scenes were specifically held back until now. “We shot scenes just for the director’s cut,” Snyder said, adding, “So in that way, it’s really a revelation because it gives that second kick at the can for big fans.”\n\n\nThe extra runtime will presumably flesh out the multiple worlds and characters that make up the core of Rebel Moon. The original Child of Fire had to introduce so many characters and concepts that the experience felt rushed, but that almost certainly won’t be the case with the new R-rated version. We’ll see how many people tune back in for these new versions. Both Rebel Moon movies were critical flops, and there might not be many people willing to sit back down for a longer version of the original experience, even if it does depict – as the official description states – “the viciously sexier, bloodier world of Rebel Moon.” If it does well enough, maybe Snyder will get to make the Rebel Moon 3 he's apparently already plotted out. \n\nThe post Rebel Moon’s director’s cut is coming with a new title appeared first on Destructoid.",

Helldivers 2 players are once more given a Major Order that could reward them the Anti-Tank Mine Stratagem. The catch? It's either that or saving a hospital full of sick kids. \n\n\nThe new MO was revealed earlier today following the successful capture of some high-level intel. For the third time, Helldivers must choose to liberate one of two planets with the MD-17 Anti-Tank Mines Stratagem as a potential reward. On the first occasion, players picked the RL-77 Airburst Rocket Launcher. There were a few regrets. Divers lost their second chance for the mines after failing to dismantle 2 billion Automatons. \n\n\nNow, Arrowhead is offering up the mines again in a laughably wicked way: Save the mines or the kids, but not both. Did I mention the hospital is named 'Super Citizen Anne's Hospital For Very Sick Children'? I feel like I should point that out.\n\n\n\n\nHelldivers 2 players are handed the trolley lever\n\n\nThe community has responded as well as you think. Thankfully, it seems like many Helldivers are on the side of saving the kids. I mean, the war has taken a heavy toll and we can use fresh recruits. Some players also suggest saving the hospital to keep up the streak of never letting Arrowhead deliver the mines. Hell, the Major Order certainly does feel like Arrowhead is already gleefully in on the gag. \n\n\n\n\nBut not everyone wants to be the hero in a Super Earth propaganda film. I have spotted a few players voting for the mines, as anyone can tell you that having more ways to blow up bugs and bots is always a good thing. I'm interested to see how the pendulum will swing during this fun moral dilemma.\n\n\nRegardless of which path is chosen, we do at least know how some players will respond.\n\n\n\n\nThe only good bug is a dead bug.\n\nThe post Helldivers 2’s latest MO forcing players to choose between anti-tank mines and saving sick kids is going as well as you imagine appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "June has come back around and with it, Pride Month is in full swing. Disney Dreamlight Valley is giving players a chance to get their hands on free in-game fashion items which can be used to display your own pride, or show support for others in the LGBQT+ community. \n\n\nThese are the same items that first appeared during Pride Month 2023, so there’s a solid chance that if you’ve been playing for more than a year you may already have these items. However, if you’re new to Disney Dreamlight Valley or missed out on the offer last year, now’s your chance to get the items.\n\n\nImage via Gameloft\n\n\nThere are eight shirts in total and each is designed in the image of a different Pride Flag:\n\n\n\nBright = Transgender pride flag\n\n\nDazzle = Non-binary pride flag\n\n\nGleam = Philadelphia pride flag\n\n\nGlow = Gay men pride flag\n\n\nIlluminate = Bisexual pride flag\n\n\nRadiate = Lesbian pride flag\n\n\nShimmer = Asexual pride flag\n\n\nShine = Pansexual pride flag\n\n\n\nThe best part about these freebies is that they couldn’t be easier to get. All you need to do is open up the main menu in Disney Dreamlight Valley, navigate to the Settings tab at the top and then click on ‘Help’ on the left hand side of the screen. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHere, you’ll find a code box where you can copy and paste the following codes, depending on which shirts you want in your game:\n\n\nItem\nCode\n\n\nGleam Tee\nPRIDE20231\n\n\nIlluminate Tee\nPRIDE20232\n\n\nShine Tee\nPRIDE20233\n\n\nShimmer Tee\nPRIDE20234\n\n\nGlow Tee\nPRIDE20235\n\n\nRadiate Tee\nPRIDE20236\n\n\nBright Tee\nPRIDE20237\n\n\nDazzle Tee\nPRIDE20238\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, not every pride flag is available as an official release from Gameloft. However, if your particular flag isn’t available on this list, you can use the Touch of Magic design feature to create your very own pride flag shirts and now, with the addition of Daisy’s Boutique, you can share them with friends who come to visit.\n\nThe post How to get all Pride Month freebies in Disney Dreamlight Valley appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "In BitLife, your character's career opportunities span numerous industries and expertise levels, from becoming a university professor to entertaining others as a clown. However, while becoming a clown sounds simple at first, there are a few hidden restrictions you'll have to know about before going all-in on this specific job.\n\n\nHow to become a clown in BitLife\n\n\nThe only requirement to becoming a clown in BitLife is to have a male character. You don't have to be born a male, but you will have to be one to get this job, and the game considers it a gender-locked career. In short, your character either has to be born a male or get gender reassignment surgery to become one if you're pursuing the clown career path.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nOnce your character is ready to apply, it's only a matter of finding the clown position in the full-time job menu. It'll appear with a clown emoji and circus tag. It also doesn't require any previous job experience or formal education, but getting up to lighthearted mischief and pranks as a kid might improve your odds. Generally speaking, though, you just have to apply and pass the interview. \n\n\nIf you don't see the clown career in your job list, close and reopen the BitLife app or age up and recheck the list. This part of the process is a matter of luck, and it might take you a few tries to find it. Since clowns don't get paid much initially, you'll have to scroll to the bottom of the job list to spot it.\n\n\nOnce you pass the interview, you'll officially become a clown. Aside from completing achievements or weekly challenges, there are no real upsides to being one, but at least you can say your character has an interesting job.\n\nThe post How to become a clown in BitLife appeared first on Destructoid.",

So, if you're wondering about the Black Ops 6 install size, here's what you can expect.\n\n\nHow many gigs is Black Ops 6?\n\n\nAs of now, Activision has yet to provide a definitive answer on the Black Ops 6 storage size. However, what we do know is that the speculated 300GB file size is not a confirmed figure for the full release.

          "description": "Catchweight Studio and Team17 have announced that the anticipated World War I horror game, Conscript, will be releasing on July 23, 2024 on PC and consoles.\n\n\nWorld War I is fertile ground for horror, considering it was… horrific. A clash of new technology and old tactics meant that soldiers were the test subjects in the new landscape of warfare.\n\n\nSet in 1916, during the Battle of Verdun, you play as Andre, a French soldier looking for his brother amongst the trenches and on the battlefield. While Conscript cops its stylings from early PS1 horror titles such as Resident Evil, you exclusively (or perhaps mostly) fight against enemy soldiers. After all, the greatest monster is humankind.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s an interesting approach to the war, as the destruction and senseless carnage left a lasting mark on those who fought in it. Little has to be done to the bleak setting of wartorn France to make it oppressively atmospheric. Taking from its inspiration, Conscript has inventory management, strict supply accessibility, documents, environmental puzzles, and saves limited by item usage (though, this can be tweaked along with the difficulty.) It also promises multiple endings and unlockables.\n\n\nConscript is coming to PC, Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, and PS5 on July 23, 2024. If you’re interested, a demo is available now as part of Steam Next Fest.\n\nThe post World War I survival horror game Conscript releases in July appeared first on Destructoid.",

Developer Billy Goat Entertainment revealed its release date in the latest gameplay trailer debut at the Future Games Show 2024 broadcast.\n\n\nWith just a hint of underlying hostilities, the fresh gameplay footage is narrated by Will Barr, managing director at Billy Goat Entertainment, trying to sell the viewer on its vibrant industrial harbor locale and quirky cast of shopkeepers in what could be mistaken for a desperate plea for help.\n\n\n\n\nThere are nine playable cyclists to take for a ride and enlist with their choice of three competing delivery factions in your race to become the best mail courier in town. It's a lot to juggle while also thwarting the schemes of the game's villain, an oil baron named Rich Villainé, who operates Polar Petroleum PLC.\n\n\nTimed delivery missions ask players to ride, grind, slide, and wall-ride their way across the town of New Island, bounding between rooftops, riding along shipping containers, and skidding under fences to deliver packages to demanding clients. It's a modern meeting of Paper Boy and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. \n\n\nOriginally announced at the 2023 PC Gaming Show, Parcel Corps is finally approaching the finish line to launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC (Steam) this fall. Those interested can take the game out for an early test ride by downloading the demo available on Steam now.\n\nThe post Survive the gig economy in Parcel Corps, arriving on digital doorsteps this September appeared first on Destructoid.",

With just one task, this challenge is easily doable for almost any player, irrespective of whether they're a veteran or beginner in Ultimate Team. Let's take a look at how many tasks are there and if you should complete the SBC.\n\n\nEA FC 24 90+ TOTS, PTG or GOTG Upgrade SBC tasks\n\n\nThe single task of the EA FC 24 90+ TOTS, PTG or GOTG Upgrade SBC has certain conditions that you need to remember while submitting the squad.\n\n\nTask 1 - 90+ TOTS, PTG or GOTG Upgrade SBC\n\n\n\nMin. 1 Players: Any TOTS or TOTW\n\n\nMin. Team Rating: 85\n\n\n\nI recommend using a TOTW item instead of a TOTS card. You can craft a TOTW card easily from the 83+ TOTW Player Pick SBC. Only use a TOTS card if you have a duplicate, which has no other use in Ultimate Team. That will help reduce the cost of completing this SBC.\n\n\n\n\nEA FC 24 90+ TOTS, PTG or GOTG Upgrade SBC cheapest solutions\n\n\nThe solo task has a pretty feasible set of conditions, but always focus on using the cheapest solution. That will help to save in-game resources for other content like the Ronald Araujo PTG SBC.\n\n\nTask 1 - 90+ TOTS, PTG or GOTG Upgrade SBC\n\n\n\nDani Parejo 86\n\n\nCristiana Girelli 86\n\n\nBella Bixby 84\n\n\nNacho Fernandez 83\n\n\nMerle Frohms 85\n\n\nKoke 84\n\n\nDabritz 84\n\n\nAlex Grimaldo 84\n\n\nKoen Casteels 84\n\n\nAny 86-rated TOTW\n\n\nRomelu Lukaku 84\n\n\n\nThe EA FC 24 90+ TOTS, PTG or GOTG Upgrade SBC, like any other gamble challenge, requires luck. The pool of available cards is enormous, and not all of them have high valuations in the market. If lucky, your pack could end up having a card like TOTS Mbappe or PTG Militao. Try out this SBC if you have an ample amount of fodder.\n\nThe post How to complete EA FC 24 90+ TOTS, PTG or GOTG Upgrade SBC? appeared first on Destructoid.",

This means players will be able to sprint, slide, and dive in any direction, and the team at Treyarch not only hopes fans will like it, but that it'll be popular enough to become a mainstay for future Call of Duty games.\n\n\nOn June 10, associate design director Matt Scronce and senior director of production Yale Miller answered questions from the press (including VGC) about Black Ops 6.

From being the fastest draw in the galaxy to mastering sleight of hand, these skills will help Kay go from a common (though wanted) thief to a legendary outlaw.

And though we know the Locust Horde quite well, it appears to be Marcus and Dom's first bout with these infamous enemies. \nCheck it out for yourself in the Gears of War: E-Day reveal trailer below: \n\n\n\"Experience the brutal horror of Emergence Day through the eyes of Marcus Fenix in the origin story of one of gaming's most acclaimed sagas,\" the trailer's description reads. \"Fourteen years before Gears of War, war heroes Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago return home to face a new nightmare: the Locust Horde. These subterranean monsters, grotesque and relentless, erupt from below, laying siege on humanity itself.\"\nXbox says E-Day has been developed from the ground up with Unreal Engine 5 and promises to deliver \"unprecedented graphical fidelity.\" \nThere's no release date or window for E-Day yet. \nAre you excited about Gears of War: E-Day?

And, as the name suggests, it brings Doomguy to a more medieval setting. Revealed during today's Xbox Games Showcase, The Dark Ages sees the infamous demon defeater shoot and blast his way through a world seemingly inspired by medieval scenery. It will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (and Xbox and PC Game Pass) sometime next year. \nFret not, though. It's still very much Doom, with plenty of weapons, demons from hell, some fantastic metal music, and a ton of gory first-person shooter action. \nCheck it out for yourself in the Doom: The Dark Ages reveal trailer below: \n\n\nAs you can see from the trailer above, Doom: The Dark Ages is a visual departure from the rest of the series. The scenery, weaponry, and even the enemies look significantly more medieval than anything else seen in the Doom series. There even appears to be a rideable dragon, too. \nId Software rebooted the series back in 2016 with Doom, which we loved – read why in Game Informer's Doom review. The studio followed it up with Doom Eternal in 2019, which we enjoyed even more. Read Game Informer's Doom Eternal review to find out why we gave it a 9.25 out of 10. \nInterestingly, this is the first Doom game from Id Software and publisher Bethesda Softworks since Microsoft (and Xbox) acquired Bethesda parent company ZeniMax Media in 2020 for $7.5 billion. Many have speculated how Xbox will handle exclusivity with its recent years of acquisitions, including whether future Doom, Call of Duty, and other popular IPs now under the Xbox umbrella will get multiplatform releases. It seems, in Doom's case at least, it will still come to PlayStation, which makes sense, considering Doom and Doom Eternal were released there as well. \nWhat do you think of Doom: The Dark Ages' reveal?

Instead of a culinary puzzle battle, you’re hopping into anime-inspired mech suits to take on other mech suits in card-based combat.\nRevealed during the Future of Play Direct players lead a crew of mech pilots, who take the form of cards, to engage in 5v5 battles against enemies. Not only can you improve their mech suits, of which 30 types exist, but you can grow meaningful relationships with your plucky pilot squad.\n\n\nThe game includes over 50 voiced characters to bond with over 50 story missions, and players can steer the narrative by making decisions such as choosing to side with one of five factions. Gameplay is all about building the most strategically viable hand based on your personal playstyle to wipe out what Trinket Studios describes as a \"star-consuming threat.\" \nBattle Suit Aces is slated to launch for PC via Steam at an unknown date.

          "description": "Publisher Nordcurrent Labs and newcomer developer River End Games have revealed Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream, a narrative-driven stealth-strategy adventure game launching next year. Revealed during today's Future Game Show Summer Showcase, Eriksholm comes from a team of developers whose experience includes Battlefield, Mirror's Edge, Little Nightmares, and Unravel. \nSet in the titular Eriksholm, a fictional city inspired by a Nordic aesthetic of the early 1900s, Eriksholm follows three protagonists united in their hearts to defy their oppressors. In the reveal trailer below, you can see one of those protagonists, Hanna, an adolescent orphan searching for her brother Herman. That journey transforms Hanna into a reluctant hero, inspiring herself and her friends to rise from the gutters of Eriksholm to become symbols of change. \nCheck it out for yourself in the Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream reveal trailer below: \n\n\nFrom Eriksholm's top-down 3D perspective, players will control the game's three protagonists to navigate through the city (aboveground and underground) while utilizing unique character skills, tools, weapons, and more to overcome enemies and complete puzzles. River End Games says players can freely move the in-game camera to survey the environment, plan their next steps, and execute strategies with perfect timing. \n\"All of us at River End Games are proud to finally reveal Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream to the world,\" studio founder and creative director Anders Hejdenberg writes in a press release. \"This is just the first glimpse of what we've done, and we hope it will capture your hearts and minds, just like it has captured ours. We can't wait to show you even more in the future.\" \nHere are some screenshots from the game: \n\nEriksholm: The Stolen Dream will launch in 2025 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store). \nWhat do you think about Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream's reveal?

We also learned that players can get their hands on it before its August launch.\nDustborn stars Pax, an ex-criminal with the unusual ability to weaponize words. As in, words are literally power for her as she can fight with shouts or manipulate people in conversations. While Pax can crack skulls using a bat and create new shouts to battle enemies, the game also focuses on building relationships with her crew of misfits (who have their own special powers). Set in an alternate Neo-western version of the U.S., you’ll travel across the country to transport an important package under the disguise of a traveling punk band. Check out its new trailer below. \n\n\nIf Dustborn piques your interest, you can play a 30-minute demo next week during Steam Next Fest from June 10-17.

What set this apart from similar lawsuits was a two-line warning in the complaint's introduction. Elsewhere, the statement could've been dismissed as typical anti-piracy posturing, but here, Bungie's relentless deanonymization of targets sends a powerful, credible message.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",
