          "description": "Worth the wait.\nSometimes good things come to those who wait, and few things embody this concept better than ASTLIBRA Revision, the final release of a game that’s been developed by one man for over 15 years. KEIZO, a humble Japanese salaryman, started work on Astlibra because he felt there weren’t enough 2D action RPG games that filled the niche he most enjoyed. Over time, he released the game in parts as an ongoing freeware project, and in the last couple of years, a team came together to help him finally get it across the finish line. Astlibra Revision isn’t without flaws, but this is overall an enjoyable and unique action RPG that we’d recommend you check out.\nAstlibra’s story primarily follows a nameless blond boy who loses a young girl close to him in a sudden monster attack on his village. When he comes to, he’s been struck with amnesia (ugh) and has no idea who or where he is, though he finds himself accompanied by a mysterious but friendly talking crow named Karon. The two set out to find their way back to the protagonist’s hometown, but they spend over eight years roaming the wilds with no success, and without seeing a single other human for the entire duration. The gameplay picks up when you encounter your first traveler and share a campfire, only to find that he and the fire have seemingly vanished without a trace by morning… as if they were never there to begin with.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

For goodness sake, just eat it. If a meal's worth remembering, then your brain will cling to the memories of those flavours for all they're worth. Anyway, external SSDs have other applications too. The right external drive can be a great place to store games, whether that's big games that you're not playing at the moment, or just as your standard install for smaller, lighter games. If that sounds useful to you, then you can currently get a discount on the best External SSD for gaming this Black Friday.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "If you’re someone who struggles with desk space, a tenkeyless keyboard could be a useful way to maximise your desktop area. By slicing off the rarely used numpad keys, a TKL board gives you a little extra room to wiggle your mouse, or actually put a cup of coffee to one side rather than jamming it somewhere between your keyboard and your monitor. The only problem with TKL boards is they tend to be slightly more expensive than their bulkier counterparts, meaning you often end up paying extra money for less keyboard overall. But if you are in the market for a slimmer typing solution, then right now you can get £100 off one of the best TKL keyboards this Black Friday.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's a repeated task with a touch of variation from cycle to cycle, typically associated with a character progression system of some kind. The classic one is the town-dungeon loop in an action-RPG such as Diablo 4. You sally forth into the depths with sword and shield, slaughter a bunch of blameless goblins, then orbit triumphantly back to the village square with its 24/7 forge and bustling adventurer's guild. Then off you go, once again, with a Sword +1 and a shield now bearing a Goblin Magnet. There are straightforward equivalents in multiplayer, especially in the wake of Call Of Duty 4: Modern Warfare - sign in, play a few matches, harvest some XP, unlock a new laser sight, equip it, play a few more matches with +5% to your aim.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Cheap graphics cards are practically mythical these days, which is great news for gaming obsessed unicorns and centaurs, less so for us mere mortals trapped in boring old reality. But there is one last torchbearer of the budget GPU, and weirdly enough that's Intel. If you happen to live in the US, then you can get your hands on the best cheap 1080p  graphics card for a smidge more than $200 for Black Friday.\r\n\n\r\nNow I know the idea of Intel making graphics cards sounds almost as preposterous as horses with horns, but they've been at it for a while. Granted, they've not been especially good at it for most of that time. The original launch of the Arc series was pretty disappointing. But Intel have worked to imrprove the performance of their GPUs, and now the Arc A750 is an excellent 1080p offering.\r\n\n\r\nIt's also a perfectly acceptable card for those looking to make their first-steps into the world of Ray-tracing. As James notes in his review \"if you’re specifically looking to try ray tracing on the cheap, know that the Arc A750 turns the tables on the RX 6650 XT with these kinds of settings. Where the A750 produced 47fps in Hitman, the RX 6650 XT could only manage 29fps, an even steeper drop from its respective rasterised performance.\"\r\n \nRead more",

In my multiplayer review, I say that it preys on nostalgia, because it does! The game's multiplayer schtick is all about bringing back classic maps to act as a smokescreen for a lack of direction. At least, that's what I think.\nI find all this nostalgia stuff interesting, mainly because it's coincided with three other events in my own personal timeline (Chapter 29 Season 11, you could say): A League Of Legends pro-player called Faker, the resurgence of a badminton star, and Fortnite's own OG event. The thing that separates them all from COD? A plan.\nRead more",

          "description": "Both the Steam Deck and Steam Deck OLED come bundled with cases – new and improved ones, if you get a 1TB OLED – so it wouldn’t initially make sense to invest in a third-party one. But Steam Deck accessories can take many forms, and I’ve been particularly convinced by the case style that combines a space-saving protective skin with a tougher removeable cover. Since the Dbrand Project Killswitch isn’t playing Black Friday ball, it falls to my other favourite, JSAUX’s ModCase, to provide the bargains.\r\n\n\r\nIt works thusly: instead of taking your Steam Deck in and out of a zip-up sarcophagus every time you want to play it on the move, you simply leave the handheld wrapped in the ModCase’s snug, rubbery skin, simultaneously protecting it and adding grip as you hold it. The front cover simply snaps on and off as needed. It’s a lighter, more compact alternative to a full case that, I can say from experience, absolutely shields the precious Deck effectively enough for everyday bag duty. As the name suggests, it’s modular as well, so you can mount other accessories (like kickstands, power banks and even a secondary cooling fan) to the back of the skin.\r\n\n\r\nJust want the case? No bother, that’s down from $30 from $26. There’s no UK version of the JSAUX store, unfortunately, though JSAUX ships internationally. Just click through the link below, and select which kit you'd like.\r\n \nRead more",

The LG 27GL83A and the slightly more expensive GL850 were the first two Fast IPS monitors to hit the scene, offering significantly better motion handling than IPS monitors up to that point - which excelled in terms of colour and viewing angles, but struggled with fast-paced action. Now the 27GL83A is back once again, and at a new low price - $200, a nice $100 reduction from its usual asking price. \nRead more",

If you liked The Messenger - classique Ninja Gaiden's greatest heir - but wished it was More Cyberpunk with cheesy PG-rated holographic dancing girls and Comix Zone-style story panels, I also also recommend trying the demo for Ninja Issen. \r\n\n\nOut today, it's the work of solo Korean dev Asteroid-J, and based on the first level, is pretty decent. It does have quite a lot of dialogue for a ninja platformer, but the dialogue is tongue-in-cheek, and hopefully it'll fall by the wayside as you push beyond the tutorial sections.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I very much do not feel like an Edo era John Constantine. I don't even feel like an Edo era Scooby Doo.

That's meta as in the overall balance of power between Modern Warfare 3 loadouts, playstyles and so forth based on a variety of factors such as map design, rather than the Alan Wake 2 kind of \"meta\", where characters talk about how they're just characters in a game and so on. I would dearly like to see some crossover between these types of \"meta\". I guess the Call of Duty that comes closest to fulfilling that idea is Black Ops 3, with its fourth-wall-breaking cyborg theatrics.\r\n\n\r\nAnyway, the discussion is interesting because it touches on the fact that the evolution of an FPS competitive meta is an artful balance of prediction and reaction, imposing new directions on players at times, taking direction from them at others. The developers want the Modern Warfare 3 meta to change \"from season to season\" - the question, of course, is how to do this without alienating fans of certain weapons and strategies.\r\n\n \nRead more",

While the exceptional 5800X3D takes the title of the fastest gaming CPU from this generation, the standard 5800X is another capable performer - and this eight-core, 16-thread CPU is significantly cheaper during Black Friday, costing just £181/$207. \nThat's pretty good going for a CPU that cost double that at the start of 2022 - especially when it also costs 60% as much as the Ryzen 7 5800X3D while delivering 75% to 95% of the performance, depending on the game. \nRead more",

          "description": "For the 25th anniversary of Half-Life, Valve not only released a documentary about the iconic FPS, but also sent out a pretty significant update to celebrate. While the Half-Life patch brought with it some bug fixes, there was one that it didn't manage to iron out. Until now, that is.\n\n\nIn a short clip uploaded to Twitter/X by user @VinciusMedeiro6, another update that rolled out recently has fixed an issue with the Blast Pit chapter of the game. Anyone who's familiar with Half-Life will be familiar with this section, and the bug in question concerns an unlucky scientist.\n\n\n\n\nWhen Gordon Freeman steps into a control room, a giant, tentacled monster crashes through a window and grabs a panicked, lab coat-wearing NPC. Unfortunately, perhaps due to limitations at the time, the boffin is dragged off by the monster, but the off animation makes it seem like he's floating in midair.\n\n\nArgh! A flying scientist!\n\n\nThis little immersion-breaking hiccup has been part and parcel of Half-Life for the past 25 years. Even the big anniversary update didn't fix it. But now, it seems Valve saw fit to finally give this small (but wholly iconic) cutscene some additional care.\n\n\nYou can see the result in the clip posted above. For a comparison, @VinciusMedeiro6 also uploaded the original. This way, you can really see the difference this little tweak has made to what must have been a terrifying ordeal for the bespectacled scientist.\n\n\nSince turning a quarter of a century old, Half-Life has enjoyed something of a resurgence, reaching its highest-ever player peak, even without fixing this bug. It sort of cements just how significant the release was (and still is), both in the FPS genre and in gaming in general.\n\nThe post A Half-Life bug that went unchecked for a quarter of a century finally gets fixed appeared first on Destructoid.",

It hasn't been used in years, and I should probably put it in its pouch to stop it from getting any dustier, but I like looking at it. Hands down, it's one of the most elegant handhelds of all time. \n\n\nPlayStation has a stellar track record when it comes to home consoles, but its history with peripherals and portables is a little spottier. Part of the problem seems to be that the company is seemingly incapable of learning from its past mistakes, and I'm afraid I'm beginning to see errors made with the Vita be…",

          "description": "On Thanksgiving, it was announced that over 20 million players have played DON'T NOD's Life is Strange. \n\n\nOriginally released in 2015 in an episodic form, Life is Strange follows Max Caulfield as she discovers she has the ability to turn back time. At first, it seems like she has just what she needs to fix all her problems and help her friends. Soon enough, she discovers that all actions have consequences, and using her powers comes with a cost. \n\n\nThe game earned itself a cult following thanks to its realistic depiction of teen life and the complex but beautiful relationship between Max and her rebellious friend Chloe Price. It spawned several titles, including the prequel Before the Storm which centers on Chloe. \n\n\n\n\nThere've been several Life is Strange titles since 2015 but none of them have managed to replicate the magic of the first game. The latest title, True Colors, was released in 2021 and tells the story of Alex Chen the empath. It's worth a playthrough thanks to its marvelous use of music. You also get to explore Haven Springs which is a small town with a lot of heart. \n\n\nIf you want to experience Max and Chloe's story again, or you're new to the franchise, there is a Remastered Collection available which contains Life is Strange and Before the Storm. \n\nThe post The original Life is Strange has hit over 20 million players appeared first on Destructoid.",

That’s all we know so far.\n\n\n\n\nI hate it when this happens, because I feel like it’s important to let everyone know that this update is soon to exist, but I also don’t have many details to share. They’re teasing that it’s “new features, stories, and more!” We can speculate, so let’s do that.\n\n\nHmm. The animals in the key art that was shared are all in the buff. Their alleged special bits are obscured by leaves, and there’s some weird one-eyed tentacle thing in the middle. That’s pretty suggestive. It’s also called Sins of the Flesh, which usually refers to the horizontal hustle. Lust. Trading genetics. If you don’t know what I’m talking about, ask your parents.\n\n\nSo, I’m guessing – and this is pure speculation – that you’ll be allowed to take your relationship with your cultists to the next level. Third base. Maybe home plate. Maybe beyond (to the dugout?)\n\n\nYep. That must be it. Sins of the Flesh is the nude patch we’ve all been waiting for. The “not rated by the ESRB” update. Because, I mean, what else are cults for? We’ve already got some doomsday stuff rolling around in the base version. The only thing cults are good for, aside from tax evasion, is some questionable sex stuff.

          "description": "Omocat's 2020 role-playing game Omori is making the leap to the page with the announcement that a manga adaptation is in the works. \n\n\nThe reveal came from the game's official Twitter account, which shared an illustration by Nui Konoito, who will be handling the art. According to the tweet, the Omori manga will be serialized in Kodansha's Monthly Afternoon, a seinen magazine that currently runs series like Land of the Lustrous, Heavenly Delusion, and Vinland Saga. It adds that \"the manga will be made for both longtime fans of the game and for a new audience experiencing the story for the first time.\" \n\n\n\n\nThe Monthly Afternoon Twitter describes Konoito as a \"talented up-and-coming artist.\" \n\n\nFull of heavy themes, Omori was met with acclaim when it launched on Steam. The Japanese release followed in 2021, and Omori has since made its way to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch. The game's story centers on a teenage shut-in and his alter-ego, Omori, and features multiple possible endings. Omori has its ups and downs, and the story and the balance it shares with gameplay won't be for everyone, but when it clicks, it really clicks. \n\n\nIt's unclear just how close the manga will stick to the story of the game. The art style is certainly suited for manga, and the subject matter is a nice fit for a magazine like Monthly Afternoon. As for when, a start date hasn't been listed for the serialization yet. \n\nThe post Omori is getting a manga adaptation appeared first on Destructoid.",

Sadly, 'twas not to be. However, with the original L4D turning 15 recently, one of the OG developers reflects on the game.\n\n\nIn a recent interview with Game Developer, former Valve creative lead Chet Faliszek waxes lyrical about the development of what would become an absolute classic in the FPS genre. With the idea being in development since 2005, it's interesting to learn that Left 4 Dead originally offered up just the versus campaign.\n\n\nImage via Valve/Steam.\n\n\nFortunately, after playtesting from the team and words from Gabe Newell, some tweaking later led us to the product we know and love today. However, Faliszek admits that the game is pretty unstable:\n\n\n\nI don’t think outside people can appreciate how broken the Left 4 Dead engine was but still shipped...It loaded each map two or three times in the background\n\n\n\n\nL̶e̸f̵t̵ ̶4̷ ̶D̴e̸a̸d̸\n\n\nFaliszek also recalls how he was put in charge of the project, adding that \"no one ever told me I'm running it.\" \n\n\nAs many of you already know, Left 4 Dead was originally going to be an offshoot of Counter-Strike (called Terror) before it became its own thing. What I do like is that it was ex-Valve writer Marc Laidlaw who thought to change it from \"for\" to \"4.\"\n\n\nTo get a bit gooey about the past myself, I have very fond memories of playing the game on Xbox 360 during my time at university. Ah, to be young and full of scrumpy cider at 3AM. Such heady days.\n\n\nAnyway, it's sad that we've yet to receive a Left 4 Dead 3. Or any threequel from Valve, really. But the original lives on. I almost feel like redownloading it and rekindling those innocent years. Oh god, I'm getting ever so old.\n\nThe post Left 4 Dead’s engine was ‘broken,’ ex-Valve employer recalls appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, if you are looking to do something while the turkey digests, you can get a copy of Diablo 4 on PC for free right now.\n\n\nIf you head over to Steam, you'll see it's currently available for the princely sum of $0. Of course, this is just a temporary discount, but you do have up to November 28, so you still have a few days left.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, if your internet is anything like mine (the countryside, amirite?) that might be how long it'll take to download the game. For you see, it's a pretty hefty 84 GB in size. That's still less than Modern Warfare 3's ludicrous 150 GB, but still.\n\n\nDo you spell it 4 or IV?\n\n\nAfter over ten years of waiting for a proper follow-up, Blizzard finally dropped Diablo 4 in June (October for PC). We thought it was pretty great in our review, but others evidently don’t feel the same. Currently, it's showing as \"Mixed\" on Steam, with a few comments taking note of some rather lackluster gameplay.\n\n\nOn the plus side, we get to temporarily try it for free over the next few days, so even if it isn't fantastic, nothing ventured, nothing gained, yeah? We also recently learned there's an expansion coming in late 2024 called Vessel of Hatred. On top of that, Blizzard is pushing out patches to bring improvements and fixes to the game.\n\n\nOoh, look.

Their stylish red and white jacket shines as they show off their impressive new counter. \n\n\n\n\nThe German fighter Leo Kliesen is back in Tekken 8 with their Baji Quan fighting style. With their hatred of the main antagonist Kazuya Michima, it makes sense if they make an appearance in the story mode. With the codename \"Seeker of Truth,\" they'd likely join the battle to find out more about their murdered mother and missing father. \n\n\nWe didn't get many details in Tekken 7 as they were sidetracked by a love-stricken Yoshimitsu, but in Tekken 6, we learned that their mother worked for the Mishima Zaibatsu and G Corporation.\n\n\nLeo is looking sharp\n\n\nNot much seems to have changed with Leo's moveset, except for the previously mentioned counter. They'll still stomp their foes' toes and have an elaborate combo set up with their punches and kicks. It's been a few years since I've stepped into the shoes of Leo but one new move seems to be an impactful swirling kick in the air, which is shown in the trailer. \n\n\nThey also has a new grappling hook that's used for Leo's Rage Art. Perhaps this will be used in combos too, but we haven't seen it implemented yet.\n\n\nScreenshot via Bandai Namco Entertainment America's YouTube channel\n\n\nThe trailer also shows their adorable carefree personality as they're surprised by the Coffee Queen's name. They stagger back like an anime character as shown in the screenshot above.\n\n\nWe'll be able to play as the German blonde Leo when Tekken 8 releases on January 26, just a few months away. They'll be fighting against many combatants, like the first French fighter in Tekken Victor Chevalier and a mysterious Heihachi-like character named Reina, and the rest of the healthy launch roster for the new Tekken. \n\nThe post Tekken 8’s Leo punches their way to victory in new trailer appeared first on Destructoid.",

Sadly, that was pretty much the last positive piece of news we got out of that project — up until now. \n\n\nIn 2022, we learned that parent company Embracer Group had dropped Aspyr as the developer and chosen its own Saber Interactive as the replacement. A studio swap is usually troubling news, but the apparent writing on the wall came only three days ago when Giant Bomb's Jeff Grubb said that “this game is not being worked on right now.”\n\n\n\n\nLuckily, however, it seems like the rumors of the KOTOR remake's death could have been exaggerated. Bloomberg's Jason Schreier has tweeted that while he doesn't know whether or not the game will ever come out, he reports from two sources at Saber Interactive that they are still working on it.\n\n\n\n\nEmbracer has yet to comment on the matter, so we still don't know the company's current plans for the remake. When asked about it during a recent Embracer financial presentation, CEO Lars Wingefors declined to provide a comment, saying \"I notice anything I say to this becomes a headline, so that is my only comment.\"\n\n\nWe might not learn much for a while, considering how Embracer is going through a troubled period. Volition was shut down, Free Radical reportedly faces closure, and its layoffs in just one quarter have reached titanic proportions.\n\n\nThe situation sucks, for developers and players.

          "description": "Honor and glory in battle will have to wait, as Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 has been delayed for about a year. \n\n\nPublisher Focus Entertainment is holding the release to \"properly polish the game.\" It's the common reason for delays, even though this one is certainly significant. The game was initially poised to drop late this year, but is now scheduled for \"the second half of 2024.\" \n\n\nFocus Entertainment won't let next month be without Space Marine goodness, however. It plans to reveal the launch date \"in early December\" — which may mean some news during The Game Awards. We'll have to wait for December 7 to know for sure.\n\n\nImage via Focus Entertainment\n\n\nSpace Marine 2 gets delayed, Tyranids rejoice\n\n\nIt would be appropriate for the publisher to reveal the date at TGA 2023, all things considered. The game was revealed during the 2021 Game Awards, delighting fans of the niche hack-and-slash game. It was welcome news. The original Space Marine graced us way back in 2011, during a time when everything was brown. It was brown, like any game of that era, but its intense combat also awarded players with plenty of satisfying red. \n\n\nStarring Captain Titus, your job was to tear through Orks with reckless abandon. It was received well and earned itself a cult following over time. Space Marine wasn't a complex game, but the mindless slaughter and spectacle made for a cathartic experience.\n\n\n\n\nThe sequel sees Captain Titus return, this time against a new foe. He and his fellows now face the Tyranids, basically giant space cockroaches. Based on what we've seen so far, the gameplay doesn't seem too much different than that of the original. Of course, there's no real reason to add too much and ruin a perfectly good recipe. \n\nThe post Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 delayed until the second half of 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "We're not far off having our eyeballs exposed to the first official GTA 6 trailer. Until then, let's talk about the classic games in Rockstar's iconic series. Hey, did you know there was a point when Vice City (easily the best entry – I will fight you all) nearly wasn't its own game?\n\n\nAccording to a blog post from Obbe Vermeij – former technical director at Rockstar Games – the follow-up to Grand Theft Auto 3 was just going to be a mission pack. Vermeij said the team had the idea to have a game set in the 80s in Miami. But it wasn't until GTA 3 became as successful as it did that a decision was made to turn Vice City into a standalone entry.\n\n\n\n\nThe original project was already six months into development, but artists and level designers were \"able to get straight onto\" the next in-line for the GTA franchise. Despite it being built off the third game's engine, Vermeij remembers VC being \"more stressful\" than Grand Theft Auto 3.\n\n\nBut wait...there's more\n\n\nIn an earlier blog, we learn that the studio was keen to try something non-GTA. Inspired by the undead, Rockstar wanted to run with the idea of creating a zombie game that would have been built off the Vice City code.\n\n\nVermeij describes the elusive project called \"Z\" (pronounced either \"Zed\" or \"Zee\") thus:\n\n\n\nThe game was to take place on a windswept foggy Scottish island. The player would be under constant attack from zombies. The player would need to use vehicles to get around but vehicles would need fuel. Acquiring the fuel would be a big part of the game.\n\n\n\n\nSadly, Z was abandoned a month into development as it was \"depressing,\" and the team got to work on San Andreas. Swings and roundabouts, I suppose.\n\nThe post Vice City originally started off as a GTA 3 mission pack appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Oh, it's been a trying time for developers, especially those who've been hurt by Unity's recent new controversial fees. As a result, many have been hightailing it outta there, looking for alternatives. In the midst of all this, one company has decided to engage in some savvy business acumen.\n\n\nGameMaker has decided to go in the opposite direction and make itself free. A recent post on the company's website is celebrating Thanksgiving by offering a free-to-use license for non-commercial purposes. On top of this, there's also a new \"one-time fee\" for a commercial license, replacing its Creator/Indie subscriptions, while Enterprise remains the same.\n\n\n\n\nWhile it can't be assumed that this is in direct response to Unity's \"Runtime Fee,\" GameMaker head Russell Kay says the team has seen \"other platforms making awkward moves with their pricing and terms,\" so saw fit to go in the other direction. Mum's the word, Kay. Mum's the word.\n\n\nIf you haven't heard of it, you soon will\n\n\nOffering support for all kinds of platforms, including Android, iOS, Amazon TV, Raspberry Pi, as well as Windows and modern consoles, GameMaker is one more alternative for developers to use.\n\n\nIf you've ever played Hotline Miami or Undertale (or both), then you've played a GameMaker title before. And with free usage for non-commercial endeavors being offered, there's probably going to be a few more people eager to jump ship.\n\n\nAs for what's going on with Unity at the moment, alongside the carnage it's created, the company may also be laying off staff. You know, that thing that's been a plague on the industry this year and is almost certainly going to make people dislike Unity even more?

The series is still going to this day (maybe not as strong in some cases), and people are continuing to modify the OG 1992 release.\n\n\nFor example, \"Blazkowicz's Text Adventure 3D\" is a different take on Wolfenstine 3D. Created by user TryHardWolfers, it essentially turns the game into a text adventure. By that, I don't mean it converts the shooter into prose, dialogue, and reams of exposition. Rather, what it does is replace every single texture with a word.\n\n\nImage via TryHardWolfers/ModDB.\n\n\nWalls are simply described as \"BRICK WALLS,\" hanging lights are dubbed \"LAMPS,\" and the machine gun you carry...well, you get the idea. There's even a screenshot showing that the picture of Adolf Hitler has been changed into words. You can download the mod from ModDB.\n\n\nIt's a wordy one\n\n\n As TryHardWolfers says, this \"text tale is filled to the brim with well-worded action and tense text map design.\" It's almost as if we've come full circle, taking the immediacy and immersion of a 3D rendered environment and broken it down into a text adventure of ye olden days.\n\n\nWith Wolfenstein 3 said to be in development, there's seemingly no stopping B.J. Blazkowicz and his Nazi-killing antics. With the first game in the series releasing all the way back in 1981 (developed by Muse Software, 11 years before id's 3D take on it), battling against the Third Reich is evidently something that just doesn't go out of style.\n\nThe post Wolfenstein 3D mod turns the game into a literal text adventure appeared first on Destructoid.",

With the studio's knitting guide, you'll have a sweater of your own in no time. \n\n\nThe guide is adequately detailed, giving you charts for each of the patterns on the sweater, as well as measurements and different yarn colors. Remedy has described the sweater as \"distinctly Nordic.\" \n\n\nIf you want to really nail Saga's look, you can also follow Remedy's cosplay guide. It covers all the details you might need including her hairstyle, gun holster, and stylish FBI jacket. \n\n\nSaga is seen in a couple of outfits in Alan Wake 2.

There's also a red jacket available for her if you've purchased the deluxe edition of the game. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\nSeason's greetings from Remedy\n\n\nIt's no surprise to see the guide coming from the Finnish studio, as knitting is a beloved pastime in the country, as well as in other neighboring Nordic countries, including Sweden which is part of Saga's ancestry.\n\n\nThis isn't the first time Remey has attempted to get its fans into the festive spirit.

It's been roughly two years since fans dove into the chilly waters of the series, and it feels like it's nearly time to strap back into that diving suit once more. And then get eaten by a Reaper Leviathan.\n\n\nAs spotted by RPS, the game's potential launch window came out of a recent financial report by publisher Krafton. Details are sparse and will continue to be so until the company is ready to announce the game proper. It's currently unknown if the next Subnautica in 2025 is set to be a spin-off or sequel, but judging by the development time, it's likely going to be the latter. Of course, that's just speculation. But isn't it fun to imagine?\n\n\nYeah, I take it back. Image via Unknown Worlds Entertainment\n\n\nThe next Subnautica game set to terrify in 2025\n\n\nThe next Subnautica has been in the works for some time now. We last heard of it back in April 2022 when developer Unknown Worlds advertised a Senior Narrative Designer position on Twitter. Since then, fans of its signature undersea horror themes have been waiting to know more. If the game is scheduled for a release in the first half of 2025, I wouldn't expect to see any reveal until Summer Game Fest next year at the very earliest. It should at least make for a good addition to a prediction list. \n\n\nAs noted by RPS, the financial report covered some future Krafton projects. Project Gold Rush is an \"Action-Adventure Sandbox\" set to launch in the first half of 2025, much like the new Subnautica. The publisher also listed a Dark and Darker mobile game, Project inZOI, and Project Black Budget all under development for 2024. \n\nThe post The next Subnautica game will apparently pull you under in 2025 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Like many video game hobbyists, I’ve had dreams of making a game of my own. Before I was even in high school, I had a binder full of designs for a game I had dreamt up, but I never really got the means to even attempt to make it. Programming has always bored me, and I tend to get frustrated with art. Even attempts at small projects to just motivate myself with some visible progress fizzled.\n\n\nThe closest I got was a brief stint writing for a game company. I co-wrote a game that is still unannounced and may, at this point, be canceled. I’m not sure. However, I got the gig at the lowest point of my life, and it gave me something to focus on. I’ve always wanted to return to doing it, but again, there’s a wall I have to climb over to make any progress.\n\n\nJordan Weisman is among those looking t…",

          "description": "The Epic Game Store's Black Friday sale 2023 has kicked off, bringing plenty of discounts for games. Most notably, Epic is offering a 33% off coupon during the sale, which can be applied toward Alan Wake 2. \n\n\nThe Epic Coupon can be used throughout the event. It lets buyers take 33% off any checkout purchase that rings up to $14.99 or more. Even though Alan Wake 2 is already set at a reasonable $49.99, using the coupon during the sale will drop it to an even more reasonable $33.49 USD. I may be biased, but that's a damn good deal for a very recently launched GOTY contender. It's a fantastic game that can last you up to around 30 hours. \n\n\n\n\n\nAlan Wake 2 and more are on sale at the Epic Games Store\n\n\nThe Epic Coupon seems to be pretty much the sale of the Epic Games Store Black Friday sale. You can find a host of games at a discount, but the coupon itself seems to be what's taking off the big, meaty chunks. The rules of the coupon state that it can be used at checkout, and you'll get another every time you \"complete an eligible transaction.\" And by that, Epic means any purchase, solo or combined, that adds up to $14.99 or more. Likely, that means you can apply it to Assassin's Creed Mirage Deluxe Edition, even though it's already listed at 20% off. \n\n\nHaving both games already on such a steep sale isn't such bad news. The year has been full of bangers, so some may at least appreciate the softer hit on their wallets. \n\n\nThe Epic Games Store Black Friday sale lasts from November 21 at 11 am ET to November 28 at 10:59 am ET. \n\n\nAt the other side of the aisle, the Steam Store has also started Black Friday shenanigans with its Autumn Sale, which also lasts until November 28.\n\nThe post You can get 33% off on Alan Wake 2 during Epic Game Store’s Black Friday sale appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 players rejoice, because Sledgehammer Games has announced it will be temporarily disabling the infamous Gaia Operator outfit, known in the community as the “Groot” skin, so it can make some changes. \n\n\nIn a recent Reddit AMA, the developer said “adjustments” for this outfit are “in the pipeline.” In response to one user asking what the studio’s plans were regarding the “problems [the skin] has brought forward to [Modern Warfare 3] from [Modern Warfare 2],” it responded confirming the fixes were incoming, and that the Gaia and Gaia Blackcell Operator skins will be disabled in a future update until the changes are ready to be deployed.\n\n\nThe Gaia / “Groot” skin has been plaguing Modern Warfare 2 players since its launch in late-September alongside Season 6. While it does closely resemble the tree-like creature in the Guardians of the Galaxy films, it’s advertised as “an earthen form of Mother Nature herself.” It would seem the major issue most players have with this skin is that, due to the nature of being a bundle of tree branches, the camouflage allowed it to blend in too well with its surroundings.\n\n\nThe alternate skin for Nova was adjusted in an October 11 patch which “added VFX to base skin that reflects the same level of visibility as BlackCell skin,” and “improved visibility compensation,” but some fans aren’t happy. Since the skin has made the jump to Modern Warfare 3, fans have taken to Reddit to accuse the skin of being pay-to-win and questioning how it hasn’t been fixed yet. Here’s hoping the team at Sledgehammer Games gives this skin a complete overhaul and alleviates players’ concerns. Because I think the skin looks really neat — if only it could not be broken on a fundamental level. \n\nThe post Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3’s Gaia skin is getting temporarily pulled appeared first on Destructoid.",

Free-to-play games are not universally bad; plenty of brilliant design ideas, engaging stories, and fun mechanics can be found in games with no upfront admission fee. But once a game’s goal shifts from singular experience to long-term engagement, any excitement I may have folds in on itself and disappears like Pac-Man.\nIt all stems from my desire for experiences, not obligations.\nIn free-to-play and comparable models, success is marked by player engagement.

It's a time of year for gratitude, togetherness, repeatedly attempting to explain my job to older relatives, and most importantly, a time when a lot of people come together to eat one really big bird.

Why not chicken, or quail, or pheasant?\nAnd that got me thinking – why limit my daydreaming to real-life birds when there's so much delicious-looking poultry in video games?

On top of that, thanks to its anthology-like nature, if one Final Fantasy game doesn’t click for you, there’s a good chance another one will. As a result, ranking the Final Fantasy series can be highly contentious. Everyone has a lot of love for the first entry they played, and then there are heavy hitters like Final Fantasy X and VII, too. \nHowever, the staff here at Game Informer did the seemingly impossible: we ranked all 19 mainline numbered Final Fantasy games, including their direct sequels, from worst to best.

Alongside animation studio Illumination, it had teamed up with Red Wing Shoes to make Mario’s shoes from the movie, not as a line of shoes for sale, but rather a hyper-realistic version of the boots – odd proportions and all – to be displayed at the official Nintendo Store in New York City.\n\nThe interest in Mario’s shoes began with the movie’s first teaser poster, where the fidelity of Mario’s footwear blew fans away. People wanted to know more about them, which led Nintendo and Illumination to contact Red Wing Shoes, a Minnesota company specializing in work boots, about making some. “We got the call, and naturally, we’re like, ‘Well, Mario is the world’…",

In December, that expansion pack is expanding a little more, as Jet Force Gemini is coming to the service.\nFirst released in 1999, Jet Force Gemini is a third-person shooter developed by Rare, the studio originally known for the Banjo-Kazooie games, but most recently known for Sea of Thieves. It's set on a sci-fi alien world, where players blast through hordes of insect-like creatures.\nThe most recent way players could experience the game on modern consoles was through Rare Replay, a compilation of classic Rare games released on the Xbox One in 2015.  For a refresher on the game, check out this 60-second rundown Rare put out a few years back.\n\n\nThe Switch Online currently includes 26 other N64 games, including the recently added Excitebike 64. It also includes Game Boy Advance games, Sega Genesis games, and DLC content for popular Switch titles, like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Animal Crossing. For the full list, check out our rundown here.",

Whether it's Travis Scott, Lebron James, or Patrick Mahomes, it's become a sort of Hollywood Star of Fame to be featured in Epic Games' hit shooter. Today. Marshall Mathers joins the club – Eminem is coming to Fortnite. \nThe Grammy winner will be added to the game's item shop on November 29. The image above shows the three versions of the rapper that will be available for purchase. From left to right, they're called Rap Boy, Slim Shady, and Marshall Never More. This release comes a few days ahead of Fortnite's Big Bang event, which is set to happen on December 2 at 2 PM Eastern. Alongside whatever world-altering event phenomena Epic plans to introduce, Eminem will be performing a live concert. Attendees will receive the Big Bang loading screen, featured at the head of this article.\nFortnite has been in gaming news a lot recently, thanks to the rollout of Fortnite OG, a record-setting new season that throws players back in time to the earliest maps in the game. It's also come under fire for new rules about which skins are allowed in certain creator-made worlds: you can see their response to this controversy here.\nWhat's your dream Fortnite collaboration?

Season OG has included weekly updates to add items from Chapter 1's various seasons, too, making it a fun romp through what Fortnite was like years ago. However, Season OG ends on December 2, which is also when Fortnite's next live event, The Big Bang, goes live. \nThe Big Bang begins on Saturday, December 2, at 11 a.m. PT/2 p.m. ET, and Epic says, \"This event marks a new beginning for Fortnite.\" \n✅ Unforgettable event\npic.twitter.com/xAhMKtmwiG\nNovember 21, 2023\nBefore the event begins, Epic says players will see The Big Bang in the Battle Royale tile in the Discover section of Fortnite 30 minutes prior to its start; that way, you can jump in before the event starts to link up with friends and get your cosmetics in order. And speaking of friends, The Big Bang will support parties of up to four players. \nThe Big Bang will be available anywhere you play the most current build of Fortnite, including PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. If you won't be near a dedicated gaming device during the event, you can check it out using Xbox Cloud Gaming, Nvidia GeForce Now, and Amazon Luna services to play Fortnite via cloud streaming on your computer or mobile device. \n\"To prepare for The Big Bang, Fortnite experiences made by Epic will be disable starting 12 p.m. ET on December 2,\" Epic writes in a blog post. \"Creator-made experiences will remain enabled until downtime for Fortnite v28.00 starts at 11:30 p.m. ET.\"\nWhile waiting for The Big Bang event, read up on everything you need to know about Fortnite Chapter 4: Season OG, and then read about how Epic says it's aware it missed the mark with a recent cosmetic restriction update for Fortnite. \nAre you hopping into Fortnite's Big Bang event next month?

We loved it – find out why in Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty review here – and if you enjoyed the base game, it's not an expansion to miss. Currently, it's only available for purchase as an add-on to Cyberpunk 2077, but if you haven't yet picked it up, it might be worth waiting just a couple more weeks. That's because CDPR has revealed Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition, which includes the base game and the Phantom Liberty expansion in one single package.\nCyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on December 5, and will be released in both a digital format and physical. Check out the box art below: \nBig news… Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition arrives on December 5th in digital AND physical form for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC!\n#Cyberpunk2077 story as well as a new spy-thriller adventure in the #PhantomLiberty expansion in one package. 🔥 pic.twitter.com/IOBPCdTXFU\nNovember 21, 2023\nAll that CDPR has shared about this new edition is the tweet above so it remains to be seen if the Ultimate Edition includes any new goodies or enhancements. Given Phantom Liberty and the Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 update improved the game in big ways, reworking and revamping several of its mechanics in the process, it's unlikely the Ultimate Edition will include any changes in that vein. Only time will tell, though. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077 review and then read Game Informer's Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty review. After that, read about the things to remember and know before starting Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, and then check out this feature about how the team behind the expansion created its spy-thriller soundtrack.

Between letting Ichiban ride a dolphin and its Animal Crossing-style city-building mode, fans of the franchise’s goofball nature should be in for a treat, and a new batch of screenshots highlight this.\nThe images provide looks at Ichiban, Kiryu Joryu, and their returning friends, such as Nanba, Adachi, and Saeko, kicking butt in a variety of classes and looking absurd doing so. Other familiar faces will be playable party members for the first time, such as Seonhee, who is shown brutalizing opponents with a whip in the images. It's clear that Hawaii will never be the same once these guys are done with it. \n\n\nLike A Dragon: Infinite Wealth hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on January 26.

          "description": "Final Fantasy VII Rebirth arrives in February, which isn’t too far on the horizon, so Square Enix is getting players prepared with a cinematic refresher of its predecessor, Final Fantasy VII Remake. The company pairs that with a batch of fresh screenshots and art, including the first glimpse of the Highwind airship. \nThe video sees Red XIII narrate the broad strokes of the 2020 adventure. While it doesn’t touch on the finer details and background of the characters, it provides a decent summary that's perhaps better served as a reminder for fans who played Remake rather than someone coming into Rebirth completely fresh. Unfortunately, the recap doesn’t touch on the events of the Intermission expansion that introduces Yuffie, who joins the party in Rebirth, so unfamiliar players will have to do their own homework on that. \n\n\nSquare has released some new images, including a piece of art depicting Aerith in front of the Highwind. The screenshots show off the town of Kalm, the summon Kujata, the abandoned Mythril Mine, and a few side characters. Oh, and Chadley is there too. \n\nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth launches on February 29 for PlayStation 5. You can watch us play two demos of the game in this video and read our hands-on impressions here. You can also get the answers to some of Rebirth's burning questions in this interview with Square Enix.",

Depending on a Fortnite skin, it might only be useable on a creative island with a T rating, meaning the Resident Evil Claire Redfield skin, which features a pistol in a holster on her thigh, can't be used on islands rated less than Teen. Players were upset with this change as it made skins they paid real money for (often $10 to $20 per skin) unusable in all the ways they might have previously been usable. \nEpic said only 7 percent of Fortnite skins are only usable on Teen-rated islands, at the time, but it's clear enough skins are affected to have the community unhappy with this update.\nOver the weekend, Epic released a statement through the official Fortni…",

You access him the same way, too – by buying fireworks and trading them with the little girl nearby in Moletown for a shiny stone.

In many ways that matter, our review of the original still stands, and snagging one of the older LCD screen models is now an even more substantial value at the lower price.

The news comes via Aftermath, which reports that the layoffs are focused in two areas – the Crown Twitch channel, which will reportedly be eliminated altogether, and the game growth teams. Employees were notified of the changes through an email from Christoph Hartman, VP of Amazon Games. This is the second wave of layoffs this division of the company has faced this year.\nAn excerpt of the announcement email can be read below:\nThere have been so many layoffs in the gaming industry this year that it's getting hard to keep track of. Last week, we learned Free Radical Design is on the verge of closing down and that Ubisoft laid off more than 100 employees. The week before that, roughly 100 employees were laid off at Destiny 2 developer Bungie. \nIn January, Microsoft laid off 10,000 employees amidst its ongoing $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which it completed last month. \nIn August, Striking Distance Studios, the team behind last year's The Callisto Protocol, laid off more than 30 employees, and that same month, Mass Effect and Dragon Age developer BioWare laid off 50 employees, including long-time studio veterans. The following month, in September, Immortals of Aveum developer Ascendant Studios laid off roughly 45% of its staff. \nJust last month, The Last of Us developer Naughty Dog laid off at least 25 employees, and Telltale Games underwent layoffs as well, although an actual number of laid-off employees has not yet been revealed. And in late October, Dreams developer Media Molecule laid off 20 employees.\nThe hearts of Game Informer's staff are with the people laid off from Amazon Games, along with everyone else who has lost a job this year.\n[Source: Aftermath]",

However, a series of strange accidents, plus some murmurings of a ghost haunting, quickly threaten to turn this renovation into an investigation.\nIn Nancy Drew: Treasure in the Royal Tower a failed ski vacation at an eccentric castle with even more eccentric inhabitants soon turns into a quest to uncover a lost piece of the history of the French Revolution.\nAnd if you’re looking for something more thrilling, in Nancy Drew: The Final Scene, you will find yourself racing against the clock to find your kidnapped friend, while also saving a historical theater with more than a fair share of secrets from demolition.\nThe games are available for purchase through HeR Interactive’s website or Steam (Stay Tuned for Danger is not available on Steam, however).

Only the DOS version of the game (available on gog.com) is supported. It's a cartoon FMV game, with an inventory, in which you have to guide Lathan Kandor through a medieval world, discovering the magic spells and the items required to defeat an evil wizard. \nEscape From Hell, was developed for Electronic Arts by the game veterans Richard Seaborne and Alan Murphy and was released in 1990. You play Alan in this keyboard-only Role Playing Game and visit Hell, looking for your girlfriend who was accidentally teleported there.\nBoth games use heavily hardcoded logic which is error prone and requires a lot of testing, so we need your feedback more than ever as they are both incompletely tested. There is sadly only one known demo for Kingdom. Support for the Windows and Mac versions of Kingdom may come later! Please contact us if you have some other demos of both games.\nTo play any of these games, you will need a daily development build.
