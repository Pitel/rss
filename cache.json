          "description": "And it can only get better.\nFor the younger readers amongst you, I suspect that many 3D games from the ‘90s and ‘00s seem rather quaint at best and downright unplayable at worst. It was a period in which the medium was geting to grips with a completely new third dimension; couple this with the limited graphical capabilities of the PlayStation and N64, and you could argue that many titles haven’t aged well.\nMe, though? I absolutely love this era. I was six when the PS1 launched in the UK; the perfect age to start enjoying classics like WipEout, Spyro the Dragon, and yes, games that perhaps weren’t suitable for me yet like Metal Gear Solid and Resident Evil. So when I go back and play titles from this era today, I find them reasonably approachable thanks to an intimate familiarity with the period. Even remasters of games that I’ve not experienced before feel oddly comforting in a way that I can’t quite describe.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The thought of shaving milliseconds off a time in a video game while playing the same sequence over and over sounds, in theory, more frustrating than fun. Sure, as a spectator, there is definitely joy in appreciating the wizardry of players pulling off pixel-perfect feats and shattering a runtime record. But I have neither the time nor the mettle to contemplate doing so myself.\nFortunately, this year gave us a game that weaved together 8-bit era charm, bite-sized accessibility, and addictive skill refinement.

One of the disadvantages of being news editor, you see, is that I have  developed a goldfish-grade attention span. In my hectic pursuit of the next scoop, or the next Elden Ring update changelog, I snatch and cast aside game demos like a pickpocket speedrunning the checkout line at Harvey Nichols. I'm dimly aware that some of these cast-aside games are Very Good. A few might even deserve to be played for longer than 30 minutes. I feel immensely guilty about that. Perhaps a little... existential, too. I have measured out my life in tutorial levels. \r\n\n\r\nSo! Rather than digging out three of the games I've actually completed this year, such as The Crush House, Death Of A Wish and Mask Quest, I'm going to gamble on recommending a few I've barely scratched, but which sure feel excellent and have attracted a positive critical consensus. If I am false in this assessment, may Horace the Endless Bear bite my head off for my impudence. Let's begin.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Between rising desktop component prices and ever-ballooning electricity bills, it would make sense that a smaller, cheaper system would take on a new appeal, and the success of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally show that convenience still trumps out-and-out performance for a lot of PC players.

My weakest skeletons, sensing their death coming, explode into fire and shards. My strongest skeletons fight so hard and with such alacrity that upon dying, they drag their spirits together and keep fighting as ghosts for a while. Foul little bone scorpions skitter around on fans of legs made from human hands. Somewhere in the middle, almost invisible among the noise, is the character I am actually playing: Path of Exile 2’s mean-spirited, callous, and gleefully enjoyable Witch.\nThis is a review in progress. It has to be. Even in its incomplete early access period, Path of Exile 2 is a great sprawling mass of a game. Three meaty acts of a planned six act campaign are followed by a trickier return tour through them, before the absurd endgame kicks into gear and the real work begins. If I came to you having played everything on offer I would be wild-haired, bloodshot-eyed and possessing perfect, incomprehensible knowledge. Let’s compromise: I have toured the dark caverns and the antediluvian crypts. I have been killed by various accumulated nasties. I’ve had a great time.\nRead more",

          "description": "The announcement of The Witcher 4 with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's Ciri as protagonist has attracted a bit of discussion. Some of the reaction is online toddlers waxing wroth about a video game having a (somewhat older!!!) woman as lead character, and especially, shock, a video game in a series that has hitherto starred a man. And some of it is people commenting more thoughtfully on whether Ciri genuinely makes for a suitable Witcher protagonist, given that she isn't the product of the typical Witcher genetic modification regime (which is heavily tailored towards men), and given that, without spoiling too much, she has gifts that make crumbly old Geralt's sword-and-sorcery skillset look rather paltry. \r\n\n\nSpeaking to Eurogamer this week, game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber responded to a few of these comments, and also shared a little about Ciri's situation at the start of the game.\r\n \nRead more",

After creating many characters, and dying and dying and dying again, I understand why it grips the brain with such fierce glee. It is a machine of grand imagination and adventuresome comedy.

It's now going to include new moves, stages, costumes, and a chaotic-looking 2v2 multiplayer tag team mode. All good news for biff 'em up sickos, as the mod is due to release on Friday. \nRead more",

          "description": "A master thief creeps over cobbles in an early modern metropolis that splits the difference between Edinburgh, Glasgow and Liverpool. Lit by gaslamps that can’t quite dispel the industrial haze, they pass for a civilian - a rough one, admittedly, but not shady enough to cause an itch in the swordarm of any passing guard.\nUntil, that is, they take to the thieves’ highway - following the trajectory of their grappling hook upward to the rooftops, from which they can see the shape of the city, and the moon beyond. Up here, it’s a parallel world - the trees on street level answered by chimney stacks, and the distant hills echoed by the rise and fall of steep gables. “We’re super proud of these rooftops,” says Greg LoPiccolo. “It’s an amazing landscape that we put a lot of thought and effort into, and it’s a lot of fun to traverse.”\nBack in 1998, LoPiccolo was the game director who saw Thief: The Dark Project to completion. Today - after an 18 year detour to Harmonix to lead projects like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, among other adventures - he’s the game director of Thick as Thieves. “It really is an opportunity to do something unique and cool and new, on the shoulders of this stuff that is now well-respected,” he says. “Thief has some legs, right? People still talk about it to some degree.”\nRead more",

Fights are like if you took a MOBA and forced both teams to bash heads constantly. Success lies in picking off Spider-Man or Squirrel Girl or Marcus Fenix so as they wait to respawn, you hop on the big area that needs capturing. Or you push the cart while tanky Hulk absorbs bullets with his biceps and John Marvel snipes from afar.\nThe more I played Rivals, though, the more it hit me that it's specifically a messier, more complex Overwatch. A hero shooter with a surprising amount of polish and charm, sure, but also one that slides off my brain like water off Birdman's back. I understand why it's supremely popular at the moment and yet, I really don't.\nRead more",

          "description": "In more ways than one, today’s Total War: Warhammer 3 expansion marks a milestone for game director Rich Aldridge and his team at Creative Assembly. Omens Of Destruction’s three headline legendary lords each bring new campaigns and units for their respective factions, but it’s the fourth lord - a Khorne champion free to all players - that I imagine Aldridge will end up remembering the most fondly.\nWhen Total War: Warhammer released back in 2016, it shipped with eight legendary lords - famous characters from Games Workshop’s fantasy setting that here act as faction leaders. The number grew steadily and, in terms of announcement order at least, today’s addition of Arbaal The Undefeated marks the series’ 100th. That's a hundred campaigns, a hundred joint efforts of game design, animation, art, writing and voice work.\nAldridge has never been shy about the team’s ambition for the series to eventually offer up each unit from every Fantasy Battle 6th edition army book (\"The goal is to do everything, right?\"). But ambition is one thing, and considering the fraught conditions at Creative Assembly and parent company Sega over the past few years, it’s not just the addition of the 100th lord that feels like something to celebrate. It’s taken time, effort, and a siesmic shift in update frequency, but Total War: Warhammer III is in the best place it's ever been.\nRead more",

          "description": "If your PC has ever started randomly roaring, and you check Steam only to find Space Marine 2 is panic-installing a 9 billion gigabyte update, then perhaps Valve's new upcoming feature is for you. For most of us, Steam simply slurps down fresh gigs of installed games automatically when a new update is released (and sometimes schedules the updates according to its own capricious whims). But the platform is testing a new option in the beta client, which lets you set download behaviour to git new gigs only when you actually launch a game. This would be a terrible curse, for reasons I will explain, but it's only going to be an option - not the new default.\nRead more",

          "description": "Pity the \"relaxing\" games which set out to blanket their players in a wholesome fog. These minimalist or slight experiences set their stall against the mainstream philosophy of video game design focused on action, rules, clear progression, and often violence. So it is with Naiad, a sometimes pleasant swim down a river in which you sing to make flowers grow and discover poems by interacting with birds, bees, butterflies and other fauna. \r\n\nYet here's the cause of my pity. All those other games, with their decisive action, systemic consequence, and neck-snapping: I was playing those to relax, too. Why else would I have snapped all those necks? Being shorn of base pleasures does not make Naiad a restorative oasis amid a desert of stressful video games, and it doesn't make it more relaxing than its peers. In fact, it makes for an experience that left me restless, even a little anxious, when it made me feel anything at all.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Marvel Rivals, the free-to-play hero shooter from NetEase, launched late last week and is exceedingly popular. It's currently fourth on the Steam daily most played, right between Path Of Exile 2 and the evergreen Grand Theft Auto 5. I think there are three reasons for this enthusiasm: 1) it's free-to-play with the usual comet's tail of microtransactables 2) it's third-person Overwatch with Marvel characters, a straightforwardly enticing licensing sandwich, and 3) people want to have sex with a larger-than-usual proportion of the cast and especially awful tongue-monster Venom, who has a good butt in this one. No, I'm not going to share pictures. You'll have to google that filth yourself.\r\n\n\r\nBut perhaps you are a sophisticated soul who has no time for such salacious nonsense. You're more interested in hearing how they're patching the thing. Enough with the butts already, dang it - this is a new multiplayer game so there must, of course, be patches! Fair enough: here's what NetEase are changing or fixing in the first major update, out now.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I feel guilty about repeatedly comparing Nebulous: Fleet Command to Homeworld, inasmuch as it's an appalling bait-and-switch. It's like offering somebody a cake that is actually a cunningly painted hunk of torpedo fuselage. It's like offering to shake hands while wearing one of those comedy hand buzzers - except that the hand buzzer is an intricate simulation of zero-G physics, missile behaviours and comms jamming, featuring spacecraft with proper internal layouts that require you to think hard about attitude control if you don't want, say, your engines to become Swiss cheese about 90 seconds before you need to retreat from combat. \r\n\n\r\nBeing a \"true\" 3D real-time space strategy game, Nebulous looks and sounds a lot like Homeworld on the surface, but it's nothing like as straightforward. It is systems within systems. It is a game in which you can, theoretically, plot the path of a single guided munition through an asteroid field, so as to catch an enemy cruiser in the back. I barely understand how to make a ship fire on another ship, using plain old armour-piercing shells, and now they're threatening to add carriers, fighters and bombers. Customisable ones! The humanity. Here's a trailer.\r\n \nRead more",

You'll require it to craft some of the new schematics that are available from the Technology tab, so let's find out how you can get Dark Fragment.\n\n\nHow to farm Dark Fragment in Palworld\n\n\nUnlike many resources in Palworld, Dark Fragment doesn't come from nodes. Instead, you can get them by defeating a particular type of Pal. In this case, you'll have to eliminate Dark Pals, but not just any of them. Only the ones that spawn on the new Feybreak Island count, and this task can be slightly tricky.\n\n\nFor starters, you'll have to reach the new island, which is located in the southwestern part of the map. You can get there either by air or by water, but the former has the risk of being shot down by anti-air measures. Next, all Pals you encounter on the island will be level 50 or above. If you're yet to reach a relatively early endgame situation, it's best to avoid going to Feybreak Island and trying to get Dark Fragment.\n\n\nIf you're level 50 or higher, there shouldn't be any problem. To be more precise, here's the list of all Pals you can eliminate to get the resource we are discussing about.\n\n\n\nDazzi Noct\n\n\nKitsun Noct\n\n\nOmascul\n\n\nSplatterina\n\n\nStarryon\n\n\n\nEven if you capture any of these Pals, you'll be rewarded with Dark Fragment.

          "description": "Fortnite's weekly quests cover a massive range of activities, from collecting particular weapon types to visiting and destroying structures. Occasionally, the tasks get even more specific, with objectives like hitting demons with vehicles appearing with their respective XP rewards.\n\n\nHow to find a vehicle in Fortnite\n\n\nFinding a vehicle in Fortnite is easy, as they appear all around the map, including in nearly every major landmark. Most landmarks have at least one, with nearby POIs and unmarked locations also having car spawns. If you're lucky, you may even find a vehicle or two along the side of a road.\n\n\nFortnite features multiple vehicle types, ranging from the speedy Whiplash car to motorcycles. For the sake of this weekly quest, it doesn't matter which one you use as long as you grab any vehicle type and hit a few demons.\n\n\nHow to find demons in Fortnite\n\n\nNow for the challenging part: finding demons to hit with your newly acquired vehicle. During your matches, you'll find small samurai mask icons on your map, indicating the locations of demon groups. There are seven predetermined spawns, with each game randomly choosing between three.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nBy visiting these samurai masks, you'll find a portal and three demons patrolling the area. Hitting all three once will give you three points toward the objective, allowing you to turn around quickly, repeat it once, and finish your weekly quest. They'll only turn hostile with the first hit, so you can take some time to aim your drive. Just be careful of nearby players who are also looking to complete this objective.\n\n\nYou can also find a larger samurai mask icon representing a mini-boss spawn. If you're near one of these, you can quickly run over and hit the boss a few times with your car. You're not required to do this, but it's a solid alternative if you suspect other players have beaten you to the portals.\n\nThe post How to hit demons while in a vehicle in Fortnite Chapter 6 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Xenolord raid, for example, is a really challenging boss to tackle who will test your in-game abilities. Naturally, the endgame stuff also requires more advanced tools and equipment, and the Double Air Dash Boots can be a welcome help in many tricky situations.\n\n\nHow to get the Double Air Dash Boots in Palworld\n\n\nLike almost every new schematic added as part of the Feybreak update, you can craft it with the correct resources. For starters, you need to be at Technology level 54 or higher and require the following resources.\n\n\n\nPlasteel x30\n\n\nPaldium Fragment x100\n\n\nNigtstar Sand x30\n\n\nDark Fragment x30\n\n\n\nOnce you have the required resources, you can get your boots from the Production Line Bench and then equip them in the accessory slot. If you are yet to reach level 54, there are the Air Dash Boots as well, which can be unlocked at Technology level 34.\n\n\n\n\nHow to use the Double Air Dash Boots in Palworld\n\n\nOnce you've it equipped, jump in the air to use an Air Dash. Then, press the Left Ctrl/B buttons to do a roll. An Air Dash is basically a Roll that you do when your body is in the air. If you're using Double Air Dash Boots, just press the buttons twice, and you'll do a couple of Air Dashes in quick succession.\n\n\nThat's all you need to know when it comes to Air Dashes in Palworld.

          "description": "So, mods are getting DLC now? That's exactly the case in Fallout: London, with its development team confirming that several pieces of DLC will arrive for the mod in 2025. \n\n\nFallout: London was a pleasant surprise. After spending years in development, the DLC-sized mod finally made it to release earlier this year, combining Fallout's unique aesthetic with the distinct culture of the UK's capital city. New landmass, new story, new weapons, new characters - new everything.\n\n\nIt's rare enough that mods of this ambition actually launch, but Fallout: London was an outlier in another aspect - it was actually good. Now, the team behind it is following up with even more content next year.\n\n\nFallout: London DLC is coming in 2025\n\n\nImage via Fallout4London/Reddit\n\n\nIn a post on Reddit, the Fallout: London team confirmed that 2025 will be a big year for the mod. According to Team FOLON, three pieces of DLC are currently planned - Rabbit & Pork, Last Orders, and Wildcard. These will use \"both new and previously cut content,\" making Fallout: London a more complete experience than ever.\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, the post was pretty void of details about what this DLC may actually entail. For now, we can only see the names and speculate. But if the quality matches that of the base mod, we're in for a great 2025.\n\n\nTeam FOLON also confirmed that it will be moving forward with \"developing our first original game in a new engine,\" which has been \"inspired by the feedback you shared with us.\" It's cool to see the studio evolve beyond its modding roots, so it'll be exciting to see what it has in store going forward. For now, you can find Fallout: London on GOG, to see what the team is cooking up for the next 12 months.\n\nThe post Fallout: London is getting DLC in 2025, making one of the best mods even better appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Mana is one of the main resources in Path of Exile 2, which is used to upgrade your skills and abilities. Since it is a key resource for casting spells, it becomes crucial to get the maximum mana pool. To help you with that, here is a comprehensive guide on how you can increase maximum mana in Path of Exile 2.\n\n\nHow to increase maximum mana in Path of Exile 2\n\n\nImage via Grinding Gears Games\n\n\nIn Path of Exile 2, increasing your maximum mana is essential if you rely on spells or abilities that use a lot of mana. Here’s how you can boost your Mana pool.\n\n\nFirst things first, you should know that intelligence is the key stat for your mana. Basically, each point in intelligence that you master will give you +2 Max Mana. In other words, the more intelligence you have, the bigger your mana pool will be in Path of Exile 2. So, your main focus should be on acquiring as much intelligence as you can. \n\n\nThere are also many Passive Skill Tree nodes that increase your mana, especially those that focus on intelligence. You will find several nodes that give a flat bonus like +10 Max Mana or +5 to all attributes, which will help boost your total Mana.\n\n\nAlso, you can equip gear that provides bonuses to Max Mana or Intelligence. You still have to rely on mana regeneration, because no matter how big your mana pool is, you will eventually drain it. In those cases, you can always opt for Support Gems, as it helps in recovering your mana significantly for a short amount of time.\n\n\nSome of the support gems are:\n\n\n\nFont of Mana: When you equip this Support Gem, you will get a boost of 40% in mana regeneration rate.\n\n\nClarity: This is another Support Gem that gives a 30% boost in mana regeneration rate.\n\n\nArcane Surge: You will basically receive an Arcane Surge and a burst of mana regeneration once you have drained the mana pool.\n\n\nThe post How to increase maximum mana in Path of Exile 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Ho, ho, ho, Santa is in town. And he’s brought a gift with him. Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.
