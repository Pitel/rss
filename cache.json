My spine now resembles a splinter of charred wood, but oh, so worthwhile. It's an absolute godsend as the days get brisker. My flatmate keeps telling me I shouldn't keep the window wide open if I'm getting cold, but he doesn't understand. I need the airflow. I can handle the chill, but if the air's too still, things go downhill!\nSo, now that we're all sitting comfortably atop our heat pads: what are we all playing this weekend?

Seems likely that the patch won’t lay all these grievances to rest, to say nothing of the other problems people have with Outlaws.

Created by two-person Hannah and Joseph Games, it casts you as one of the Vollings - a race of gaunt elven humanoids, hailing from the same school of manky action-figure as Judero, who have been shunned by their gods and have accordingly turned to paganism. \r\n\n\r\nSpecifically, you're a lord who has set up a spice farm on a \"cursed\" island, the former home of a long-dead civilization. This certainly sounds like a foolish thing to do, and it's no huge surprise that everybody on your farm has gone missing. So off you trot with a team of four custom-generated companions to solve the mystery, and also make up gnarly spells by daubing your blood on trees.\r\n \nRead more",

I’ve brought an utterly improbable Champions League title to Aston Villa, built an enviable Ultimate Team and developed a formation that keeps at least outright humiliation at bay in online matches… And yet, my heart isn’t bursting with the joy of joga bonito. This must be how Guardiola feels, popping onto the pitch to celebrate his annual Prem title with the latest batch of ruthlessly efficient, lab-grown wonderkids and pushing down the feeling that this one doesn’t feel quite as special as the first.\nThat is to say, EA Sports FC25 is a bit like FC24. Which was quite a lot like FIFAs 21-23, which had a lot in common with the FIFAs our ancient ancestors used to play by the fireside in their primitive tribal dwellings. There are noticeable additions - particularly new tactics controls and a 5v5 Rush mode - and I’m glad they’re here. But as much as they contribute towards a continuously compelling suite of foot-to-ball, they can’t quite dislodge the nagging feeling that this shouldn’t be an annual, full-price release anymore.\nRead more",

          "description": "Look out, it's Spiders. It's fun to write about Spiders, because you get to frighten people for a moment, before they realise you're talking about the game development studio, Spiders. They have just released GreedFall 2: The Dying Land into early access. For those who don't remember the first GreedFall, it was a colonial-styled RPG about landing on the magical shores of another continent and getting into scrapes with monsters and frontiersfolk. This time the story is furthering the fantasy Columbian exchange by putting you in the role of a native who's been uprooted against their will and taken to the \"old world\". The game's release comes against a backdrop of dissatisfaction in the studio. But workers have gained some concessions in talks. \nRead more",

          "description": "For years, a dangerous and charismatic game has evaded the grasp of many designers. Some say it doesn't exist, that no publisher would ever back it. I'm talking about the one city block RPG that Warren Spector has often mentioned. Sure, we've seen a few usual suspects already - Deus Ex Mankind Divided, Disco Elysium, even Else: Heart.Break - they all grimace in the line-up but nothing ever sticks. Now, out of the gloom of indie development, comes another perp ready to have his mugshot taken. Shadows Of Doubt is an open world detective sim that comes perilously close to being our guy. Its clothes, stature, gait, and fingerprints match the description of what Spector often describes. And yet, if you tilt your head, something is just a little off. The game isn't confined to one block. It's not an RPG precisely. And its simulation has plenty of bugs, jank, and unintentional comedy. But after all this time, in the absence of a smoking gun, shouldn't we just put this guy in the slammer and call the case closed? I say yes, let's. Officers! Arrest this game, it's brilliant. \nRead more",

If you really want to showcase your knowledge, though, you may want to mention that dinosaurs may have actually fought with large swords lodged between their teeth. Dinoblade demonstrates this! And no, they haven't discovered swords alongside dinosaur fossils yet because palaeontologists have been unlucky thus far. \"Soon\", you tell them.\nRead more",

Yes!\nI’m therefore somewhat unnerved to report that my enthusiasm has been tempered significantly by actually playing it. I’ve since used all the straws I’ve clutched at to spell out \"It’s just a demo\" on my floor, but the fear remains that Crimson Desert’s fantastical open-world exploration is going to be interrupted by regular bouts of twangy, unwieldy, unsatisfying combat.\nRead more",

The anime's official X account also released an eye-catching visual to hype the upcoming season.\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, Anime News Network reports that veteran singer and voice actor Mamoru Miyano will be joining the cast as Hikaru Kamiki, while veteran voice actress Hina Kino will be voicing the enigmatic Tsukuyomi. However, Season 3's official release date is yet to be revealed.\n\n\nOshi no Ko Season 2 started airing on July 3, with the final episode airing on October 3. The season focused on the 2.5D theatrical adaptation of the famous Tokyo Blade manga. While it expounded on Aqua, Akane, and Kana's character dynamics, the latter episodes developed the narrative in terms of Aqua's search for revenge and Ruby's realization of her beloved doctor's tragic fate.\n\n\nThe anime is an adaptation of the popular manga series written by Aka Akasaka and illustrated by Mengo Yokoyari. It won the Anime Series of the Year at the Tokyo Anime Award Festival 2024.

          "description": "Velmi příjemné překvapení. Dobře napsané i zahrané scény mezi lidmi, kterým poněkud nefunguje komunikace a navzájem si připadají \"trochu divní\". Fungovalo by to dobře jako normální (nehororové) současné drama. Ke konci se to trochu zvrhne do standardní vyvražďovačky, ale pořád výrazný nadprůměr s několika výbornými scenáristickými nápady. Neviděl jsem dánský originál. (Ilča 60 %)",
