Picture that game in your mind: the quietness of the hallways versus the crash of a thunderstorm outside, the sickly-sweet 90s décor, the fairy lights and screwed-up balls of paper, the gentle amber pressure of cloistered teenage memories. Now, imagine a faint scuttling behind the skirting boards. A rattling in the pipes. Was there a toilet in Gone Home's autumnal mansion? I can't recall, but you should probably steer clear.\r\n \nRead more",

Edders had a dream, the dream of Halo Infinite getting a battle royale mode. Like Moses descending from the mount with a Needler in either hand, he bedazzled and amazed us with visions of \"an enormous playground stitched together from some of Halo's most iconic maps of yore; Warthogs and Mongooses roaming the lands; players racing to the M41 SPNKR as it spawns; grappling to a rooftop and laying down covering fire; some contrived reason as to why there's a circle of poison gas closing in... but hey, rings are what Halo does best, right? It's 100% doable.\"\nEd Thorn has always been a journalist of great sagacity and supernatural insight, so it was of no surprise to the RPS editors of the era when rumours bubbled up a few months later that Certain Affinity had partnered with 343 Industries (nowadays Halo Studios) to make Halo battle royale a reality. These rumours have now been confirmed by Certain Affinity's former design director Mike Clopper, who says the now-cancelled mode could have been a \"game changer\".\n Read more",

Say hello to the Mara Yama, the ickiest Celestial faction so far.

I did not rush the new Steam demo for Kalypso’s revival, Commandos: Origins, but it’s still doable inside half an hour. I had expected a little more, but what’s here has certainly given me some optimism that the full game might well be worth sinking - if not months - at least more time than it takes to wildly lunge at a few nazis en route to your objective.\nRead more",

I’ll move on from his large majesty for a moment though, because it isn’t the only thing this one looks to have going for it. \nIt’s a single player action RPG, to start with - a genre I’m always interested in watching evolve in ways not tied to its usual form as a good-boy-points-vomiting loot casino. It’s also based on Slavic folklore, something that’s not too uncommon but strikes a wonderful mix between blackly funny whimsy and intense dread when done right. Also, I’ll take more discordant folk music any time. Trailer below.\n Read more",

When I first laid eyes on Secret Door's Sunderfolk, while lurking to the rear of a gaggle of journomancers at a preview event last week, I let out an ostentatious sigh. Fortunately, I still mask up to preview events, and am thus free to adopt all kinds of snotty facial expressions without being set upon by burly PRs and shoved into the minifridge for later disposal. To sum it up, Sunderfolk is a hex and turn-based 2-4 player digital boardgame with fantasy animal characters and deckbuilding elements, reminiscent of Gloomhaven. Conceived during the pandemic lockdowns as a way to \"bring back game night\", but without the traditional 30-minute unboxing ritual, it's played on the big screen but controlled using a dedicated smartphone app, with players stroking and swiping to move characters and play cards.\r\n \nRead more",

Chief creative officer Henrik Fåhraeus also offered thoughts on what Paradox have learned from the disastrous launch of Cities: Skylines 2 in late 2023. Specifically, he said they need to give actual players access to the game early on, not just testers.\n Read more",

As penance, I’ve found some DDR5 RAM deals in the Prime Big Deal Days sales that should set any modern rig for years and years of... well, games launching properly, I suppose.\nAs such, while 16GB is the bare minimum you can get away with, I’d recommend 32GB to be safe. For pure value, check out Crucial’s DDR5 Pro set, which I've been using in my own testing setup for a while: it’s down from £140 to £80 on Amazon UK, and down from $150 to $81 on Amazon US. But the single best deal here, I reckon, is Corsair’s Vengeance RGB kit, which the US site has slashed from $130 to $100. That’s the same price as the non-RGB equivalent kit while also being faster, at 6400MHz to 6000MHz. Us UK folk can also get a similar set for £101, down from £147, though that’s set at 6000MHz.\nRead more",

          "description": "A few months ago, Broken Sword creator Charles Cecil walked out of the office of Revolution Software and onto the Shambles, the Diagon Alley-esque street that has survived since York’s days as a medieval trade hub. He closed the door behind him, somewhat grumpily - he’d had to work late, and it was already past eight o’clock. Then a voice piped up behind him.\n\"And one day, when you get older, you will play Broken Sword,\" said a young woman to her toddler. \"This is where Revolution are based.\"\nCecil had stumbled across an annual pilgrimage to the site where British point-and-click adventures are made. From the sounds of it, this young woman was not alone in making the journey. Cecil registered Revolution’s office address on Google a year ago - and received an email to say that 40,000 people have checked it out since.\n\"We’re incredibly blessed to have a really positive and lovely collection of people who want us to succeed and love the games that we write,\" Cecil says. \"We love our interaction with them.\"\nThese might read like the words of a good community manager, rather than a man expressing a deeply-held sentiment. Yet Cecil does not take his relationship with Revolution’s fans for granted. At times in his long career, he has lost touch with his audience. And at others, he’s feared they might turn their back on him.\nRead more",

          "description": "For the record, I still think it’s easier and safer to go with a microSD for your Steam Deck storage needs, and with good Prime Big Deal Days savings on two of the best – the Samsung Pro Plus and the SanDisk Ultra – that opinion remains unbudged. Still, you know what they say: when you’re holding a tiny screwdriver, everything starts to look like a tiny screw. So I understand if the call to replace the Deck’s internal SSD, or indeed that of your Asus ROG Ally, proves too strong.\nIn which case, have a look at the Crucial P310, which I added to our best SSDs list just last week, and is currently joining in the Prime sale frivolities. Specifically, the 1TB model has been slashed from £128 to £70 on Amazon UK, while it’s the 2TB version that gets a US discount, dropping from $265 to $168.\nRead more",

          "description": "The obvious way of bundling up Beautiful Light is probably \"Hunt Showdown meets S.T.A.L.K.E.R.\", and whoops, I've already committed to that in the headline. But the first game that came to mind when I chanced on some playtest footage last night was The Town Of Light, LKA's deeply disquieting game about exploring a carefully recreated abandoned asylum.\nThere's the title overlap, of course - it's always a bit of a provocation when horror games make a point of being well-lit. Beyond that, the two games share an interest in dessicated interiors where chairs huddle disconsolately, where the sun slides through windows whose curtains have rotted away, and the plaster flakes in ways both pretty and macabre. But where The Town Of Light gave you one rambling building's worth of encroaching hallucinations, Beautiful Light gives you a whole wilderness, where the architecture scales from \"dreary forgotten school\" to \"gleaming underground base\". It also gives you a lot of guns. Devised by Geneva-based Deep Worlds SA, this is a team extraction shooter where six squads of three gasmasked alpha-bravos compete to retrieve an artifact from a quarantine zone full of deadly anomalies. \n Read more",

That will allow you to use any two in the remaining slots. \n\n\nAfter completing the challenge, you'll get a Premium Mixed Players Pack. While the odds of the possible cards from the card isn't great, it's not a bad option to consider since the SBC can be completed for free of cost.

Do you ever feel sad that Microsoft was the only big console manufacturer to dodge the draft to enter the portable gaming war? Fret not, as a fan just turned the original Microsoft Xbox into an enhanced Portable version of its former self. The result is visually reminiscent of the Steam Deck, but its design features no lack of that sweet early '00s Xbox edge: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI really do think it looks great, with the Xbox's menu screen going together perfectly with that edgy design, but it's also a technical marvel.\n\n\nTwitter user Redherring 32 explains that this isn't new hardware or emulation. We're not looking at an attempt at making a smaller console like the PlayStation classic. Redherring 32 really did take the time to \"slimify\" the original Xbox's hardware to fit into a portable shape. He trimmed the Xbox's motherboard to fix the case, then added a 9” 480p display and pure digital video/audio. He also modernized the original package by adding a 100W USB C charge and play and is still working on adding WiFi functionalities for Xbox Live. \n\n\n\n\nAnd there's more good news. Redherring32 announces he'll make everything he showed opensource soon, meaning you, too, will be able to go about making your own tiny portable Xbox:\n\n\n\n\nI hope you have enjoyed this glimpse at an alternate universe where the Sony PSP never existed, and the Xbox made use of its ultra-powerful hardware to face off against the Nintendo DS. If not, you can keep on waiting for the elusive official Portable Xbox console that Phil Spencer keeps teasing us with.\n\n\n\nThe post Someone made a portable Xbox appeared first on Destructoid.",

Raid Weekends happen every week from Friday, 7 AM UTC, to the following week, Monday, 7 AM UTC. \n\n\nAfter the completion of the Raid Weekends, players will receive Raid Medals. To help you maximize this item, here is a comprehensive guide on how to get more Raid Medals in Clash of Clans.\n\n\nHow to earn Raid Medals in Clash of Clans\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nBefore we dive in, you must know that you are ineligible for Raid Weekends if your clan’s Capital Hall level is below two. Also, your clan’s leader or co-leader must opt for the raid in order to obtain the Raid Medals.\n\n\nBasically, you can get Raid Medals through two ways: attacking and defending. So, let’s say you are raiding a clan’s capital. The amount of Raid Medals depends on the number of districts that you have destroyed. Not to mention, it also depends on the number of attacks that are done by every player. \n\n\nIn other words, if you have destroyed districts with a greater number of attacks, you are likely to get fewer Raid Medals and vice versa. But here’s the catch: a player can get only five attacks. If you do 3-star damage to a district, then you will receive an extra attack.\n\n\nYou can also earn Raid Medals through defense. However, it depends on the number of Housing Spaces destroyed by your defenses. But here’s the catch: you will not get any Raid Medals for any successful defense if your clan hasn’t performed any raids.\n\nThe post How to get Raid Medals in Clash of Clans appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Backyard Basketball, is finally ready to come off the bench for some sweet public testing! You can now play again on ScummVM this beloved Backyard Sports title (not to mention the last unsupported game on the SCUMM engine). Play with the Backyard Kids and even create five of your own! This game also features (now former) NBA and WNBA stars Kevin Garnett and Lisa Leslie!\nMuch like the other sports titles of this franchise, controls are point-and-click by default, with gamepad and keyboard options. Pick your favorite kids and play some 3 on 3 basketball. Don't forget your 110% Juice or Dunking Donut for a slamma jamma! Pass that ball in, listen to the live commentary from Sunny Day and Barry DeJay and shoot some jumpers on your way to a championship.\nAre you ready to play? Dig up your good old CD and fire up the latest daily build!\n>",

To je jeho největší a soustavný problém, ale má i mnoho dalších, například arabské teroristy z \"Návratu do budoucnosti\" a pointu, spočívající v tom, že veřejnoprávní média vám non-stop lžou a vy jim to štastně žerete (což je pointa pravděpodobně nezamýšlená, protože film spoluprodukoval Český rozhlas). Je velmi smutné vidět dílo, na kterém pracovali lidi, o kterých víme, že jsou schopni vyprodukovat něco zajímavého, a výsledek dopadl takto strašlivě. (Ilča 10 %)",
