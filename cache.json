Its zany premise of broomsticking across badlands in search of delicious candy, coupled with a magical mix of coloured gem grabbing, weapon power-ups, flashy bomb attacks, and mouthy fairies, have been staples in every instalment since the beginning.\nBar one pachinko outlier, most Cotton games follow the same 2D horizontal shooting format, including 2021's Cotton Fantasy: Superlative Night Dreams. But with Panorama Cotton, a 1994 Mega Drive exclusive and one of the system’s most technically impressive titles, Success switched the action to a 3D perspective, plotting the camera behind Cotton's back. It delivered a Space Harrier-style dynamic across eye-bleedingly colourful stages, occasionally with varying paths. Despite being a graphical showcase for the system, it wasn't as critically well-received as its predecessors, never appeared overseas (until 2021), and had a famously low print run.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Another Crab’s Treasure, from developer Aggro Crab, is another one of these endeavours, albeit with a significantly more colourful approach compared to the usual intensity of many Soulslikes.\nThe adventure begins with the introduction of protagonist, Kril, a Hermit Crab living above the surrounding ocean in a small tide pool. Before long, Kril is removed from his precious shell, as he now seemingly owes money to a creature by the name of the Duchess due to new tax laws. A Loan Shark — who takes the form of a plastic Shark-head-on-a-stick toy with a top hat — takes Kril’s shell as collateral, sending the adorable young crustacean on a journey to the depths of the ocean to retrieve his shell and return to his lovely tide pool. The writing is charming and full of witty remarks from the game’s cast of characters, resulting in an engaging narrative that will provide a few laughs here and there.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Upon learning of the existence of asymmetrical multiplayer horror Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game, from Friday the 13th and Predator Hunting Grounds’ Illfonic and Teravision Games, you’d be forgiven for having, well, questions. The first of which, understandably if you don’t happen to carry a burning penchant for cultishly adored but undeniably niche 80’s schlock, is simple: Why? First, why get invested in another asymmetrical multiplayer game from a studio that has a bit of a history with limited shelf lives? And why, of all the licenses, have they chosen one so relatively forgotten, at least in comparison to Predator, Ghostbusters, and Friday the 13th?\n \nRead more",

From a top-down view, you still play as a newly awakened vampire on PVE, PVP, or private servers, and you're still tasked with becoming the most powerful bloodsucker around. It has, however, streamlined some things and added in an endgame zone. All of this combines to form a survival game that was great back then and is even better now, with thrilling MOBA-esque fights and little in the way of faff.\nRead more",

          "description": "Hardcore tactical FPS Gray Zone Warfare is proving to be yet another of 2024’s unexpected successes, shifting over half a million copies when it launched into early access last week. Unfortunately, in its attempt to eat Escape from Tarkov’s lunch – a timely one, given that game’s self-inflicted DLC misery – it’s currently choking on the wishbone of some truly dire performance issues. Even players with tip-top graphics cards are seeing heavy stuttering while out in the field, and none of the updates released thus far, including today’s Hotfix #3, have done much to soothe it.\nSaid hotfix does include some fixes for other widespread problems, including a second attempt at preventing players from becoming headless when rejoining a server (an amusing though resilient glitch, given a previous hotfix had also tried to nix it). But having played a bit of this third patch on a usually reliable RTX 4060, there’s clearly an awful lot of work left to do before Gray Zone Warfare performs acceptably.\nRead more",

Naturally, our favourite gods and goddesses are emerging from our evenings of hacking and/or slashing. For me, Nemesis provides a lot of chuckles. Not because she's bright and jokey (she is frownier than a wet bulldog). But because she's determined to put the player in their place and to beat you at your own roguelike. Narratively, she fulfills a role similar to Meg in the first Hades, that of closest frenemy. But in gameplay terms, Nemesis won't stoop to something as trite as a boss battle. Oh no. She's out to mess with your build.  \nRead more",

Honestly, it fits the dinky PC so well you’d have thought Supergiant had decided to make this roguelike sequel a Steam Deck game that just happened to run on desktops by accident.\nHades the first was much the same, taking to the Deck like Hercules to Augean shit, but Hades 2 barely even gives away that fact that it’s unfinished. It doesn’t crash, stutter, or hang, and there’s no point in talking about settings when it runs at a practically perfect 60fps on max quality. Make that 90fps on the Steam Deck OLED, too. It’s just a fabulous game for handhelds, even in its earliest of early access days.\nRead more",

Me too! Must have been the direct influence for Sea Of Thieves' new Season 12, which launched earlier this week with a bang - from two smoking barrels! Among the additions in this season of the ever popular salty sea-dog open-world adventure are double barrel pistols. They deal less damage per shot but have higher rate of fire, and you can charge them up to fire both barrels at once. \nOn the other end of the weapon scale are new throwing knives, capable of sneak attacks, light slashes, or, you know, throwing. You can nab any throwing knives you see lying around, too, which is fun. But honestly, the Bone Caller tool (the aforementioned jar of skeletons, which has a great Jason and The Argonauts vibe) and the Horn Of Fair Winds are are probably more useful. The winds from said horn can make your ship go faster, but can also put out fires or crowd control enemies, or for some reason make you swim faster? I don't think that makes sense, to be honest, but the horn has limited uses so as not to make you an unstoppable wind machine. \nRead more",

Fr. Justin, who was already kind of controversial anyway, offered the sacrament and claimed to be a real priest to Futurism, and gave the thumbs up to baptising a baby in Gatorade in an emergency.\nCatholic Answers (who have the domain Catholic.com; gotta imagine His Holiness wishes he'd moved quicker on that one) then defrocked Justin, making him  a lay theologian in a suit jacket, jeans and an open collar shirt that gives him a \"me and my wife saw you across the bar\" kind of vibe, when before he had the whole dog collar kit and caboodle.\nRead more",

Vengeance promises many new things: a revised battle system, a new story branch, new areas, and more. What I found when I played, was several punches to my metaphorical ribs. A few to my gut.

I will now attempt to summarise my time against these creatures, wish me luck.\nRead more",

Nokia skončila se Symbianem a přešla na nově vznikající systém Windows Phone. Výsledek se dostavil o 4 roky později, kdy Microsoft definitivně vydáním posledního telefonu s Windows Phone současně celou akvizici za 7 miliard dolarů odepsal a začal se soustředit na jiné cesty jak vydělávat v mobilním světě.",

We also don't know who did it, but I personally hope it was someone being affected by Phil's decision. It doesn't really help, but it would make me feel better at least. \n\n\nIn the end, this will probably end up being nothing more than an inconvenience to Spencer, as he can repair it with just a few clicks if he has enough materials in his inventory. He can switch servers too if he really wants to, but I expect he may encounter this a few times over the coming weeks. \n\n\nSome say it was a waste for the player, who will have invested a lot of loot and materials into making the nuke, that they could have used on something else. Not me though, I love it. It's not about the money, it's about sending a message. \n\nThe post Someone dropped a nuke on Xbox boss Phil Spencer’s Fallout 76 base appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Moss is a common plant in real life, but it's worth its weight in gold in Hades 2. It's a resource that you cannot complete the game without, allowing you to progress past an obstacle barring your path. Here's where to find Moss in Hades 2, and where it's used.\n\n\nTo find Moss in Hades 2, you must look for it up on the surface. Likely, you've already made it past the wards, but the blood curse is keeping you grounded down below. You now must make a mad dash to the city above and grab as much Moss as possible before getting unceremoniously hurled back to the Crossroads. So, let's get to it.\n\n\nWhere to find Moss in Hades 2\n\n\nMoss, like in real life, is a clumpy, green, flowerless plant lying around in Hades 2. You need two Moss to complete the 'Unraveling a Fateful Bond' incantation, allowing you to stay up in the fresh air indefinitely. Moss, once found, must be harvested by hand in the City of Ephyra. Thankfully, you won't need a tool for the job.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nYou may die multiple times in your attempt to gather Moss, but that's okay; it's all part of the process. Once you have what you need and have the other materials gathered, you'll be able to walk through the city and beyond unimpeded. Well, if we don't count the legions of Chronos' army, I suppose. \n\n\nWhat Moss is used for in Hades 2\n\n\nOther than the aforementioned incantation, Moss has multiple uses in Hades 2. It's used in other incantations, such as the 'Observance of Gaia's Secrets', which you should get after you've made some significant progress in the game. Casting it allows you to gather one additional resource by hand. Moss is also used to unlock a weapon Aspect for the Argent Skull, a mechanic you can learn more about here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs mentioned, Moss is a great plant resource in Hades 2.

          "description": "There are many resources and reagents in Hades 2, used for acquiring new tools or upgrades. Some unlocks require materials you haven't seen yet, and figuring out where to go can be stressful. Bronze is such a resource in Hades 2, and here's how to get it.\n\n\nYou can find Bronze after reaching the surface area of Hades 2. That's easier said than done, of course. You'll need to remove wards barring your path, and then figure out how to not die in minutes due to Melinoë's blood curse. There are, clearly, some steps involved, so let's get to work.\n\n\nHades 2: How to get to the surface and mine Bronze \n\n\nFirst things first, you will need to get far enough in the game to learn about the incantation needed to remove the wards blocking access to the surface. Follow our guide on how to get the incantation, and then read our second guide on how to remove the blood curse. Once those tasks are done, scroll down below.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nBronze is harvested from Bronze Ore Deposits in the surface area of the City of Ephyra. It's the rundown city you must fight in after you reach the surface. The ore itself is brown, and looks to be a pile of discarded Greek armor and weapons. It makes sense, especially since the once-proud Ephyra was ransacked and left as a mere husk. With the default version of the pick, you'll get three Bronze per Ore Deposit.\n\n\nWhat to do with Bronze in Hades 2\n\n\nAs Bronze is used to unlock and upgrade weapons in Hades 2. Like me, you probably first became aware of it as a needed resource to unlock the fifth weapon in the game, the Argent Skull. Well, rub your chin in perplexity no more, friend; the riddle has been solved. You'll also need Glassrock for the Skull, which you can find in the Fields of Mourning.

          "description": "Raven Software finally released a patch to address the glitch that prevents players from reloading while having the automatic tactical sprint setting turned on. Yet some players are reporting that the update worked, while others claim the issue still remains. \n\n\nOn May 8, Raven Software rolled out an update that fixed the automatic tactical sprint and the prioritize interact settings from preventing players from reloading. Both glitches first reared their ugly heads after the Season 3 Reloaded update on May 1. While waiting for a fix, turning off both settings acted as a temporary workaround, but was never going to be a long-term solution. After the fix went live, the Warzone devs reassured players that they can safely re-enable their original settings, but that's not the whole story.\n\n\nImage via Activision\n\n\nWarzone content creator Metaphor reported that the reload bug is not fixed unless you use automatic tactical sprint on mouse and keyboard. \"if you press shift at all the old bug is back and your reload is cancelled, because they never actually fixed the bugs root cause and you might think to disable shift, doing so will make it so you cannot stand up naturally after proning (Shift + W) is how most people do it.\"\n\n\nModernWarzone substantiated the claim and confirmed that players are having issues after the update. However, professional Warzone player Tommey pushed back against the reports and provided video evidence that you can now reload while sprinting. In saying that, the pro player also believes that the prioritize interact glitch isn't fixed. \n\n\nWithout any response by the devs, it's hard to tell what exactly is going on with the glitch. We will provide an update when Raven Software makes an official statement on the matter. But for now, players can always turn both settings off if the issue is still a problem. \n\nThe post Warzone players aren’t sure if the auto tac sprint glitch is fixed or not appeared first on Destructoid.",

In the reveal trailer, we get a first look at the character design and in a pleasant surprise, the Joker will be voiced by actor Mark Hamill, who previously played the iconic DC Super-Villain in the Batman: Arkham videogame series and Batman: The Animated Series. \n\n\nThe Joker will be available when MultiVersus launches on May 28. \n\n\n\n\n\nMultiVersus initially launched an Open Beta in July of 2022. After achieving plenty of success, the devs closed the Open Beta in June of 2023 to rework the free-to-play fighter's netcode, matchmaking, and progression system. Additionally, Player First Game promised to introduce new characters, maps, modes, and features when the title officially relaunched. The devs aimed for an initial re-launch window of early 2024, but players will finally be able to jump back into matches soon. \n\n\nSo far, the devs have already revealed that MultiVersus will use rollback netcode, which will improve matchmaking and gameplay fluidity. Then, Player First Games dropped a blog previewing new gameplay changes, including a new dash attack, parry improvements, character kit tuning, and more.

These items can then be upgraded to the game's current maximum item level (528) using Flightstones and Crests. Each item costs two Bronze Bullions, so the ability to get two for \"free\" this week has the community buzzing. \n\n\nTo get your two Bullions, just accept the weekly quest \"Emissary of War\" from Kazra in Valdrakken, near the center of the plaza standing next to the fountain:\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\nThe quest tasks players with completing four Mythic dungeons of any difficulty, including non-keystone Mythics. For anyone looking to do a bit of catching up this week, keep in mind that Mythic 0's are now about the difficulty that Mythic +10's were last season due to the \"dungeon squish\" that occurred as part of season four. The gear is appropriately powerful, dropping at item level 493, but expect a little more resistance than you may be used to.\n\n\nAntique Bronze Bullions are typically earned at a rate of one per week via the Fated Raid, which rotates weekly. Looking For Raid is the easiest way to earn these, as they drop randomly once per week from any boss. You're guaranteed one a week, and it usually doesn't take more than 3 to 4 boss kills to get a drop. On a final note: you can earn your raid Bullion this week along with the two from the weekly quest, whether you do it before or after turning the quest in.\n\nThe post How to earn two extra Bronze Bullions this week in WoW appeared first on Destructoid.",

Even better, Mark Hamill is voicing the Clown Prince of Crime once more.\nThough we don’t see gameplay, a cinematic trailer sets up a dramatic confrontation (and likely emotional reunion for fans) between Batman, voiced in the game by the late Kevin Conroy, and his archnemesis. \n\n\nThis marks the first game to feature both Batman: The Animated Series actors together as their respective characters since 2018’s Lego DC Super Villans. Conroy passed away in 2022, and prior to 2024's Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, MultiVersus was the final game to feature his Batman performance. Following his death, Hamill had alluded to retiring the Joker role for good. However, dataminers uncovered Joker’s existence in MultiVersus in 2022 and found audio files revealing Hamill’s performance. This means he likely recorded his lines before Conroy’s passing. \nJoker is the first new character to join the existing line-up of fighters, but he won't be the last. We're curious to see who else joins the fray after MultiVersus re-launches on May 28 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

          "description": "Arkane Austin was reportedly set to release a big Redfall update this month that would have added offline play to the always-online game before Microsoft suddenly shut the studio down, according to IGN. This follows yesterday's news that Microsoft was shutting down Arkane Austin, Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks, Mighty Doom studio Alpha Dog Games, and absorbing Roundhouse Games into ZeniMax Online Studios.\nThis offline play update would have addressed one of players' biggest complaints with the game – that Redfall always requires a connection to the internet – but now that update will never see the light of day. It's an especially concerning detail considering now that Arkane Austin is closed, the day when Redfall servers are no longer live, rendering the game unplayable, seems closer than ever before. \n\n\nIGN also reports that it was told the now-canceled Hero Pass, which would have added two additional playable characters to Redfall, was scheduled for release around Halloween. It obviously won't be released now – Bethesda says those who purchased the Hero Pass will be eligible \"to receive the value of the upgrade\" – but if it had hit the game around Halloween, that would have been roughly 18 months after Redfall's launch. \nRedfall hit Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 2 to poor reviews from critics – read Game Informer's review here – and players alike, and the first-person multiplayer vampire shooter failed to recover, with Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer saying, \"I'm upset with myself,\" when asked about its launch.\nAccording to reports, some of Arkane Austin's staff hoped Microsoft might cancel Redfall or reboot it as a single player game, following the former's acquisition of ZeniMax Media in 2020 for $7.5 billion. Arkane Austin director Harvey Smith said Microsoft canceled a PlayStation 5 version of Redfall following this acquisition. \n[Source: IGN]\nHow do you feel about Microsoft shutting down Arkane Austin?

Recent seasons have been themed after corners of the Marvel Universe, like Avengers vs. X-Men or Thunderbolts, but this season leans a bit more into the Marvel Multiverse with Blink and the Exiles. This season, titled \"A Blink in Time,\" introduces five new characters, two new locations, and more.\nThe new characters joining the game in A Blink in Time are as follows:\nBlink (5 Cost, 7 Power)\n\n\t\nOn reveal, swap the last card you played with a higher-cost card from your deck.\n\n\t\nNocturne (3 Cost, 5 Power)\n\t\nYou can move this once. When this moves, replace its location with a random new one.\n\n\t\nSage (3 Cost, 0 Power)\n\t\nOn reveal, +2 power for each different power among all other cards here.\n\n\t\nNamora (5 Cost, 6 Power)\n\t\nOn reveal, give +5 power to each of your cards alone at another location.\n\n\t\nSasquatch (6 Cost, 10 Power)\n\t\nCosts 1 less for each card you played last turn.\n\n                  \n\nOn top of those all-new characters joining Marvel Snap collections, there are two new locations: Panoptichron, where cards that didn't start in your deck get +2 power, and Cancun, where power at that location doesn't count toward winning the game. New albums featuring Dan Hipp and Rian Gonzales also further incentivize Variant collections by rewarding items themed after Werewolf By Night, Silk, and Iron Lad. Finally, we know the dates of the Series 5 releases of this season. Baron Zemo and Nocturne get their Series 5 release on May 7, Sage arrives on May 14, Namora on May 21, and Sasquatch on May 28.\nMarvel Snap's May season, A Blink in Time, kicks off today.

This news arrives at the same time Nintendo has revealed it will announce the Switch successor by March 2025, meaning there's still some time for the Switch to catch up to Nintendo's best-selling console: the Nintendo DS. \nSince the last financial results call, the Switch has sold an additional 1.96 million units, bringing its grand total up to 141.32. That keeps it in second place, only behind the Nintendo DS' massive 154.02 million. It's possible the Switch surpasses the Nintendo DS, especially considering the Switch will likely continue to sell even once its successor is released, but that's a big 13 million-unit gap to close. \n\n\nElsewhere in the financial results, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has hit 20.28 million units sold, Super Mario Bros. Wonder has sold through 11.96 million, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe another 6.79 million, and Pikmin 4 3.33 million. The fiscal year ending with March 2024 was a strong one for Switch software, selling 163.95 million units in Q1 through Q3 of Fiscal Year 2024. However, compared to the same quarters for Fiscal Year 2023, Switch software is down 4.7%. \nWith the Switch successor on the horizon, that number will likely be way up this time next year. \nIn the meantime, read about the Nintendo Direct happening next month, and then check out Game Informer's top 10 Switch games.

That could still be the case given Furukawa's reveal, but given the timeline, Nintendo could also announce the successor that month, meaning we likely wouldn't have it in our hands until later that year. Only time will, though, but at least we now officially know that by this time next year, we'll know what the successor to the Switch is. \nFor more, read about how Nintendo reportedly demoed the Switch successor to developers at Gamescom last year, and then check out Game Informer's top 10 Switch games. \nWhat do you hope to see from the Switch successor? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "Hades II has launched into Steam Early access, and it’s also Game Informer’s next cover story (which launches on May 14).  Whether you’re a returning fan or a newcomer, it may take a few runs to get your bearings as Hades II sports new progression systems, resources, and new layers to existing mechanics. It can be a lot to dig into, given the game more or less tosses you into the deep end without context for how things work, at least initially. Instead of spending several runs figuring things out, here’s a short, spoiler-free primer explaining some core new features to get you going on the right foot. \nWhat Are Ashes? \nAshes are a currency used for unlocking Arcana cards. They serve a similar purpose as Darkness from the first game. They often appear as a reward for completing a room, but …",

Join Alex Van Aken – who visited Supergiant for the cover story and has played Hades II extensively – and myself for a look at the game's second area and boss fight. Spoilers ahead if you want to experience the locations and enemies for yourself, but otherwise, enjoy this New Gameplay Today episode!\nThis second area in Hades II is called Oceanus, an underwater realm Melinoë uses to bypass the armies of Chronos, the game's antagonist and Titan of Time. Oceanus is generally more difficult to navigate than Erebus, the first area, due to explosive hazards, more powerful ranged enemies, and darting schools of swordfish. The level culminates in a musical boss fight against a rock band of sirens led by Scylla, a well-known sea monster from Greek myth. Scylla sings while her keyboardist and drummer back her up. Despite sharing one health bar, the individual monsters can be stunned and knocked out of the fight, muting the appropriate instruments in the active music track.\nSee Oceanus And The Scylla Boss Fight In Action:\n\n\nHead to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

The cover story reveals why Supergiant decided to create its first sequel, how it chose a new protagonist in Zagreus' sister, Melinoë, along with her mythological origins, and how the team is changing its approach to early access and the content it has planned for the future.

However, a PSN account will be required to play through Ghost of Tsushima's multiplayer Legends mode, or if you want to use the new PlayStation PC overlay to acquire trophies and more. \nThis follows news from last week where PlayStation announced (and later walked back) that Helldivers 2 players will soon be required to link a PSN account to their Steam account, leading to widespread anger in the game's community. It seems Sucker Punch is looking to get ahead of this by revealing its PSN plans ahead of the game's launch in 10 days. \nThank you for your feedback.\nMay 3, 2024\nIf you're unfamiliar with Ghost of Tsushima: Legends, it's a standalone multiplayer experience that allows you and up to three other players to fight enemies in special missions, defeat waves of foes, and complete raids. A PSN account will be required to play Legends, but if you want to play through the game's story (and Iki Island expansion), you won't need one. \nGhost of Tsushima hit PlayStation 4 on July 17, 2020, before launching on PlayStation 5 with a Director's Cut on August 20, 2021. This is the version of the game hitting PC in 10 days on May 16, 2024.\nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Ghost of Tsushima review, and then read about why the Director's Cut of Ghost of Tsushima is a must-play for fans. \n[Source: VideoGamesChronicle]\nAre you going to play Ghost of Tsushima on PC?

GameIndustry.biz confirmed that 13 employees were affected, 11 of which were full-time and 2 freelance contractors. \nThe Deetmans have made a call for any studios with open positions to hire its affected staff. The founders plan to stay in business and have vowed to rebuild, which includes launching a Kickstarter to crowdfund Deliver Us Home,  a sequel to Deliver Us Mars. \nIt was clear Keoken was in trouble when the founders posted a video in March revealing it had been unable to land a publishing deal after spending two years pitching five games to over 40 publishers. Instead, the founders decided to publicly reveal these projects to help garner interest, one of which was Deliver Us Home and two were Deliver Us The Moon spin-offs, including a VR game. \nKeoken once employed 45 employees, but the headcount was reduced to 20 by March 2024 before four more employees were let go that month. In an interview with GameIndustry.biz, the Deetmans revealed they had gone months without collecting a salary to help stay afloat.",

          "description": "Universal Orlando Resort has released a new video detailing what to expect at its Florida-based Super Nintendo World when it opens as a land in its Epic Universe theme park next year. In it, the company confirms the land will have three rides, including the Donkey Kong Mine Cart Madness coaster that's expected to open later this year in Osaka, Japan's Super Nintendo World. \nThe video includes digital fly-overs of the park, showing viewers what it will look like when it opens next year. If you've seen Super Nintendo World in Japan, this park looks nearly identical, with both the Donkey Kong Country (and mine cart coaster) section and the Mushroom Kingdom with Peach's Castle, Mt. Beanpole, the Mario Kart: Bowser's Challenge augmented-reality ride and Yoshi's Adventure dark ride. \nCheck it out for yourself in the new Super Nintendo World overview video below: \n\n\nAs you can see, the Donkey Kong Mine Cart Madness coaster will feature state-of-the-art track technology that allows it to create the illusion that riders will actually jump off the tracks, just like in the Donkey Kong Country games. \nLike in Hollywood's Super Nintendo World, which does not have the Yoshi's Adventure ride or the Donkey Kong expansion as a result of space at the location, and Osaka's Super Nintendo World, guests can purchase Power-Up Bands to play in interactive Key Challenges to earn coins and more. Plus, returning locations like the Toadstool Cafe restaurant and more will be at Orlando's iteration of the park. \nHere's a look at some of the locations to expect when Universal Epic Universe opens next year: \n\nFor more details about the park, read Game Informer's breakdown of everything coming to Epic Universe next year. After that, check out photos from our visit to Japan's Super Nintendo World, and then watch this vlog of our day at the theme park. \nAre you excited for Epic Universe and Orlando's Super Nintendo World?

As for why, the company is aiming to be more selective about its projects moving forward. \nThis news comes from a release related to Square Enix's holdings, which explains the company is incurring losses of 22.1 billion Yen, or roughly $140 million, on its financial books for the fiscal year that ended in March. \n\n\n\"At the meeting convened on March 27, 2024, the Board of Directors of Square Enix Holdings voted, in light of the myriad changes underway in the environment surrounding its group, to revise the group's approach to the development of high-definition (HD) games with the intention of being more selective and focused in the allocation of development resources,\" the release reads. \"As a result of a close examination, the company expects to recognize approximately 22.1 billion Yen in content abandonment losses on its books for the fiscal year ended March 2024.\" \nWhile potentially canceled games might sound doom and gloom, it sounds more like Square Enix is sharpening its developmental focus to ensure that the games it releases are hits or, at the very least, financially successful for the company. Nonetheless, it sounds like roughly $140 million of games in development have been canceled and it's unlikely we'll ever find out what they were. \nThis release comes after a big splash from Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, which Square Enix released in February.

This lines up with what the Starfield team shared last year in its 2024 plans for the game.

For those who have wanted a more mature experience, Jackbox Games is finally granting you your wish, as it has announced Jackbox Naughty Pack, a new release of three games that promises spicy prompts and dirty fun later this year.\nWe don't know what kinds of games will be included, but Jackbox Games teases \"spicy surprises and maybe even some familiar faces.\" Does that tease a new, mature-themed You Don't Know Jack? Will we get dirtier iterations on some classic Jackbox titles? Or will these be all new games that just so happen to include some favorite characters from past games? Unfortunately, for now, Jackbox Games is being tight-lipped with the contents of Jackbox Naughty Pack.\nHowever, the studio did release a teaser trailer, which you can view right here. Jackbox Naughty Pack will arrive sometime this year, and Jackbox Games promises more details this summer.\nAre you excited for a spicier take on Jackbox Party Pack? Do you and the people you play Jackbox games with typically go mature-themed with your answers, or are you more of a family-friendly Jackbox gamer?
