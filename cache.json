Rather than his natural display of heroism, however, the image instead shows the Hero of Hyrule kicking back with some refreshing watermelon — hence why we were reminded of the former Mario Sunshine fiasco.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "I never thought I'd hear the words 'roguelite' and 'Minesweeper' together in the same sentence but here we are. Let's! Revolution! is a joyous mix of both Minesweeper and a roguelite, tasking players with hunting down a deliciously repugnant king through a series of increasingly complex tile maps to enact their titular coup. With all tiles facing down on arrival, you'll need to hop from square to square to flip them over and reveal the king's hiding place before progressing to the next level. But with several of his royal agents stalking the roads and highways, you'll need to choose your route carefully, making good use of your character's unique set of skills to arrive at your final destination of Beebom City. That, and employing a bit of the old Minesweeper noggin, of course. \nYou see, tiles come in two types in Let's! Revolution! The aforementioned road tiles, and surrounding landscape tiles. The latter all have numbers denoting how many road tiles surround it, giving you just enough information to build up a picture of where the road (and the king's lackeys) might be lurking. Take care, though. This lot are a tricksy bunch, and can quite quickly overwhelm if they're revealed too soon and all at once. That's Let's! Revolution! in a nutshell, at least, but the real joy of this run-based rogue comes from its gorgeous presentation and its brilliantly conceived character classes that twist and mould its basic building blocks into fresh new forms each and every time. It's great fun, and I can't get enough of it.\nRead more",

I’ve had a cosy ol’ time taking out all the protagonist's items one by one and placing them in the various places around her rooms. From her childhood bedroom right up until her first house, I love how relaxing and gratifying it is to decorate each room. But after replaying it for this month's RPS Game Club, there’s one section that gave me quite the opposite reaction.\nA big part of Unpacking is learning about the character’s personalities through their objects: what clothes they have in their wardrobes, what items fill their bookshelves, which kitchen utensils make it from move to move, and so on. These contextual clues act as a subtle but incredibly effective story-telling device. There is one level, however, where it’s not all laid-back fun times and it's when the protagonist moves in with her first partner, who I will henceforth be referring to as ‘finance bro boyfriend’ - and wow, he is the absolute worst.

The lush camera pans of your Planet Of Lanas, the haunting backdrops of your Somervilles and the gooey, malleable monstrosities of your Insides. These dramatic moments linger in the memory much longer than their respective running and jumping, and if it's a proper platforming challenge I'm after, I usually look elsewhere, swapping cinema for action with your Raymans, Trines and Oris. \nFull Void, on the other hand, is a cinematic run and jumper that manages to strike a good balance between both parts of its personality. Following in the Another World school of gorgeous pixel art meets one-foot-wrong-and-you're-dead-style platforming (albeit with much more generous checkpointing than its 1991 source material), there's a real athleticism in your teen hero's journey to bring down a despotic AI, making its intricate leaps and bounds just as memorable as its down-to-the-wire set pieces.\nRead more",

That's made it a strong option for gaming, but a high asking price of $300 at launch - plus expensive motherboards and DDR5 - put it out of reach of most sane budget builds. That's slowly changing as these chips and other components become cheaper, and today the 7600X has hit a new low price in the US: just $200 at Amazon.com, a full $100 off its MSRP and a great deal for a processor with this kind of performance. \nRead more",

Perspective is key because here's the thing: this is a world where you can bring photos to life, the 2D image becoming a 3D reality when you place it within the puzzle world.\nIt's an incredible hook and one which I've never seen in a puzzle game before. There are echoes of The Witness, Gorogoa, and Superliminal here, but Viewfinder's dizzyingly mind-melting puzzles are still very much its own. It impresses from the get-go and continues to pull tricks out of its silky tophat right until the end of its four hour run time. It's compact, brilliant, and one of the best puzzle games of 2023.\nRead more",

Which may be why I don't quite know how I feel about Decarnation.\nThere's a big content warning needed here for sexual assault, something that I assumed would turn out to be the whole point of the game. An unfair judgement, it turns out, as one of its strengths is the intriguing mystery of what's actually going on, not the more common \"what traumatic thing is everything a metaphor for\".\nProtagonist Gloria has a lot going on, see. She's a talented cabaret dancer who recently modelled for a statue, for an artist who immediately makes some creepy remarks about how she's an ugly old hag at 29. Misogyny and self image are at the heart of this, but they're wrapped up in Gloria's worries about getting older, chasing intimacy with a new lover, and her deep love for dance, an art form that games so rarely do much with. It's not an ugly or blunt game, despite its distressing themes, and I think that's why it works for me overall.\nRead more",

          "description": "It's weird when one of your favourite notE3 announcements ends up being a little more than a notion of a game, or rather a trailer for a game that doesn't quite exist yet. But hey, when it's Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector we're talking about, I think it's okay to give it a pass. I am so, so pumped to head back into the world of the Helion System developer Jump Over The Age has created here, even if it's going to be a good long while before we get to do that yet. Indeed, when I spoke to them ahead of the game's reveal at this year's PC Gaming Show, creator Gareth Damian Martin said it probably wouldn't be until at least next year before we start seeing it in action.   \nThe good news is, while we wait for Starward Vector to come into orbit, Damian Martin is putting out a free monthly newsletter to help fill that Citizen Sleeper-shaped hole in our lives. Entitled The Helion Dispatches, the second episode just came out this week, and I've been enjoying it immensely.  \nRead more",

Then I slowly swapped all of that out for gems, and my board became a pristine, soulless, basically fully optimised money printer. \nLuck Be A Landlord is about meeting ever escalating rent demands by playing a slot machine. Each month gives you a limited number of spins to come up with the money, and the chance to add one of three random symbols after each spin.

Everyone has a dozen or so action points per turn to split between movement, shooting, or miscellaneous contextual actions. Chance to hit is never listed, but accuracy can be bumped by spending extra action points. It innovates too by giving everyone a small pool of free movement, keeping battles moving, and broadening the tactical possibilities. It borrows as much from modern designs and is mostly better for it.\nRead more",

          "description": "When I played a timed early demo of Forever Skies last year, my key question about this airborne Subnautica-like was how it would successfully guide its players across its boundless world of ruined, rusting skyscrapers, overgrown plant tendrils and swampy, toxic clouds. As we searched for a rumoured cure that would save what's left of humanity back in the depths of space, would we be ping-ponging from perilous rooftop to perilous turbine pad unaided as we bobbed along the nauseous expanse below? Or would it be a more guided affair, with forgotten text logs and computer terminals nudging us toward tailored waypoints? \nHaving now played its recently-released early access version, the answer is a mix of both, with the freedom to scavenge and craft new modules for your burgeoning airship at your leisure while a handy radar points you in the direction of its critical story path. Assuming you've found a busted one to research and 3D print yourself, of course. The tools you need to survive don't come easily in this strangely picturesque wasteland, but they're also not so hard to track down that you ever feel truly threatened by the minutiae of staying alive. It's a pleasant mix for casual survival toe dippers like myself right now, but the dramatic climax of its first major story chunk suggests this is but a brief calm before the eventual storm.\nRead more",

          "description": "I remember playing the first Oxenfree so clearly. The nervousness of not truly understating the supernatural forces its cast of troubled teens was up against, the heightened tension of uncovering the buried secrets of Edwards Island, and - what I loved the most - the finely tuned undercurrent of dread that quietly crept through the game. It conjured a sense of unease in me that I couldn't shake loose, and it was a feeling that clung to me throughout my entire playthrough.\nSo I was pretty stoked when Night School Studio announced Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals, a direct follow-up set five years after the original game. Lost Signals may take place in a new location with a new cast of characters, but there's still a lot of overlap. There are supernatural spooks, personal character drama, creepy radio equipment, and those good ol' screen glitches that I've missed so much. But with all these tethers to the first game, Lost Signals feels like a re-tread of the same ground. It's still a good sequel, I should add, but it's not a particularly satisfying one.\nRead more",

          "description": "Dino shoot ‘em up Exoprimal comes out this week, July 14th, so publisher Capcom have pulled the curtain on the game’s post-launch plans. The roadmap seems standard for a live-service shooter as it details plans for future modes, maps, and exo-suits variants used to murder formerly-extinct animals in increasingly creative ways. Thankfully, the post-launch plans do get slightly weirder with two crossovers: one with Street Fighter and another with Monster Hunter.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "In the wake of publishers adopting NFTs and predictive language programs so flimsy that even 1998 Kojima would have laughed you out of the room for daring to call them actual AI, you fools, you complete donkeys, Konami’s infamous pivot-to-pachinko seems almost quaint now. Perhaps embarrassed by the relatively small amount of egg on their face compared to some of their more ridiculous contemporaries, Konami have decided to come crawling back to try and buy our collective forgiveness by way of their second-only-to-Squeenix PS1 back catalogue. Well it won’t work, you swines! What’s that? Suikoden remasters? Well, it still won’t work! Metal Gear Solid on Steam, you say? Balls. Balls and zounds. \nMGS1 has, of course, been available via GOG for quite a while now. It’s a noble, if barebones port, but it does mean I have Snake-related options besides dusting off my PS1 classic, which is currently doing a bang-up job keeping a dodgy table bang-upright. Either way, I’ve found myself on a bit of Metal Gear kick recently. Phantom Pain, for all its narrative faults, holds up still as a cracking stealth sandbox rivalled only by Hitman. And MGS1 is still dramatic, still goofy, still alternately comedically overwrought and genuinely touching. But most of all, it's still haunted by the same ghosts that dwelled inside it all those years ago. \nRead more",

The new multi-department union represents over 200 employees at the company’s Irvine and Burbank offices, working across divisions including QA, marketing, localisation, product development, live service, and more. Yesterday’s vote had 91 workers voting “yes” and 26 voting “no.” \r\n\n\r\nAEGIS announced plans to unionise earlier this year, with goals that included higher base pay, better benefits, balanced schedules, and proper staffing to “end patterns of overwork.” At the time, AEGIS claimed that “nearly a third of Sega’s long-time workers still lack full-time status, paid time off, proper training, or even bereavement leave.”\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "If - like me - you quickly ran out of storage space on your Steam Deck by downloading 30 games released around 2007 that you'll never play, you'll be on the lookout for a compatible microSD card so you can comfortably download another 70 without breaking a sweat. Thankfully, Amazon Prime Day has your back, offering some pretty tasty discounts on the Samsung Pro Plus in its 256GB and 512GB varieties.\r\n\nOur James reckons these specific cards are the best fit for Valve's chunky handheld, and I agree. As usual I took his advice and ended up with the 512GB card that has served me well over the last 12 months. Although the 256GB model might be enough if you're planning to stuff it full of games with a smaller footprint (such as the excellent Pizza Tower, Vampire Survivors or many other of the Steam Deck's best games), I'd recommend the 512GB card if you're leaning towards beefier titles.\n\n Read more",

          "description": "Larian Studios are nothing if not enablers of wild, unspoken desires. In Divinity: Original Sin II, they provided the impossible - making each companion character a playable protagonist, and weaving their unique plotlines into the tapestry of the main story. It was one of the RPG’s great innovations - handing you a killer backstory, a tangible motivation, and a set of prompts for how you might go about roleplaying your exiled lizard prince or demon-possessed musician. For those of us who struggle with the blank page of character creation, it was a godsend (quite literally, since the adventure concerned your ascension).\nChoosing a set character came with an obvious drawback, however. It robbed you of the chance to make the most of Larian’s character creation tools, fiddling with freckles and tattoos and biceps until you had an alter ego entirely your own. With Baldur's Gate 3, Larian have threaded the needle, conceiving an origin character who looks, sounds and fights however you like, yet enters the game with a frankly frightening amount of personal history and suspiciously lumpy baggage - and as they announced during the final Panel from Hell last week, some of that baggage will be soaked in blood. Optionally available as one of seven starting personalities, the Dark Urge is a mass murderer. Their species, gender, class and eyebrow thickness are up to you, but what you can’t change is their deep and insatiable need to kill for pleasure.\r\n\n \nRead more",

V důsledku toho vzniklo na šest desítek patchů, které míří do jádra spolu s hlasitým voláním po konci podpory 32bitového x86, kteréžto procesory Thomas nazývá muzejními kousky.",

Before the first wave hit the Switch, there seemed to be a lot of animosity toward the DLC.

I'm not seeing it on the socials as much as I used to.

          "description": "I'm BLU, da-ba-dee\nFinal Fantasy XIV Patch 6.45 arrives today, as an interstitial content patch adding a plethora of side content. The big draw for 6.45 across all players is probably the new Variant Dungeon, but Final Fantasy XIV is also adding some more to do if you're feeling Blue.\nThe Blue Mage crew of Final Fantasy XIV gets a sizeable content drop today. The specialized class, built around learning magic from monsters and undertaking full-Blue challenges separate from the usual Duty structure, gets a level cap bump up to 80. Alongside that, Blue Mages have a new series of spells to discover and learn, and new quests to undertake. And thanks to the heightened level cap, the content will run all the way to the end of Shadowbringers, and then some.\nI've been poking around the new spells as other Blues discover them, and it looks like you'll definitely want to be through all of base Shadowbringers and into the post-launch patches. The Eden raid series also looks to have some spells to pick up, so unlocking those through normal means first will help.\nA new Variant\nBut if you're not a Blue Mage fan, there's still some content to play today. The Mount Rokkon Variant Dungeon has been added, with new encounters to take on and loot to plunder. Those cosmetics are slowly being discovered by players as well.\nSurprisingly, we also got a new hairstyle in 6.45. Reports seem to indicate it works for all the player races, too.\nAnd of course, for those working on the Manderville weapons, the Somehow Further Hildibrand Adventures quest line continues. It will probably continue to escalate and get stranger, as those quests do. (I'm still fairly early on in the quest line, but enjoying it a lot.)\nYou can find the full Final Fantasy XIV Patch 6.45 notes here.\nThe post Final Fantasy XIV Patch 6.45 is out now, with some new Blue Mage content appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "No more item drops way over your level\nDiablo 4 Season 1 is already full of updates aimed at improving the overall quality of life for players. But a recent tweet by the Associate Game Director of Diablo 4, Joseph Piepora, indicates another big change is coming. Starting in Season of the Malignant, Sacred Items will have a level requirement cap of 60, and Ancestral Items will have a level requirement cap of 80.\nIn the current system, these items have no such cap meaning you can be level 55 and get a Sacred Item drop that requires level 65. Levels don't come quite so easily in Diablo 4, so it makes it hard to get excited about something you can't use for potentially days. It's always bittersweet when you see a cool drop, only to realize you won't be using it any time soon.\n[caption id=\"attachment_388914\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]\nWhy is this such a big deal?\nWith the improved item level requirement caps, it will be a more streamlined process of gearing. Each item tier will now essentially have its own bracket. Sacred Items will essentially be used up to level 60, after which you will begin looking for Ancestral Items.\nIt will also be a lot easier to obtain endgame gear for alt characters. If you are on a level 100 character in the existing format, you can get a nice Ancestral Item drop for another character, but it may require level 100. With the new system, the absolute highest item level requirement for such an item would be 80.\nHonestly, the existing item-level cap system doesn't make much sense. It was probably more of an overlook on the part of Blizzard rather than an intended feature. This is just another overall win in the quality of life department for Diablo 4. Now all I want to see is some Sorcerer reworks.\nDiablo 4's first seasonal update, Season of the Malignant, launches on all platforms on July 20.\n \nThe post Diablo 4 season 1 bringing a big change to item level requirements appeared first on Destructoid.",

The online multiplayer FPS game is set in environments that are nearly fully destructible, adding to the chaos and fun.\nRecently, the developers announced that new anti-cheat software would be patched into the game. This caused some concern regarding the Steam Deck, though it appears the worries were unjustified.\n[caption id=\"attachment_389574\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via SgtOkiDoki[/caption]\nBattleBit Remastered adds anti-cheat software\nThe FPS indie game has been using Easy Anti-Cheat, which is convenient because it is compatible with Proton, which is what Valve uses to run Windows apps on the Linux-based OS. This setup has been shaken by the announcement that BattleBit Remastered will be using FaceIT instead.\nThe worries stem from the fact that FaceIT isn't typically compatible with Linux. However, developers have confirmed that a new version of FaceIT is on the way, and it will support the Steam Deck. The game will be the first to use the latest version of FaceIT, which should be excellent news for fans playing on the handheld.\nAnti-cheat software has its benefits, as it helps to ensure players can compete in a fair environment free of hackers. This is something desperately needed, as BattleBit Remastered has been subject to DDOS attacks in the past. Nevertheless, anti-cheat software does come with its downsides, often in the form of compatibility issues and high CPU usage.\nBattleBit Remastered has found incredible success, selling almost two million copies in just two weeks.

          "description": "So soon after GameStop pulled out of Ireland\nA lot of people are more likely to opt for digital copies of games rather than physical ones these days. In fact, 70% of games sold in 2022 were digital downloads, and there's little reason to suggest this trend won't continue. As such, retailers may see less and less reason to stock actual physical stock, and that's what's currently happening in the United Kingdom.\nAccording to a report from GamesIndustry.biz, Tesco - one of the UK's biggest supermarket chains - will stop selling physical copies of games across all 2,800 of its outlets. It seems as though the retail giant is making the change due to the move \"towards digital entertainment.\"\n[caption id=\"attachment_392240\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"] Image via VGC.[/caption]\nThe company has said it will continue to sell digital store points, however, but physical copies will not be sold once current stocks have depleted.\nDigital is king, it seems\nThis development comes not long after GameStop had to cease operating in Ireland, closing all 35 stores in the country, eight of which were in the capital city of Dublin. GameStop made the announcement on Instagram back in May. It seems physical copies are just becoming less and less prevalent in this modern gaming era. Another report says that 87% in the UK of sales of Diablo 4, Street Fighter 6, Final Fantasy XVI, and F1 23 were through digital downloads.\nThat doesn't necessarily mean physical games won't still be around for some time. The current-gen release of The Witcher 3 launched physical copies at the start of 2023, and a bit further down the line, the hit indie game Stray also released a physical edition.\nHowever, the fact that these were news stories shows just how rare it's becoming. Even though there may be some of you out there who want to retain physical media, digital gaming is now proving itself to be the dominant choice.\nThe post UK supermarket giant will no longer be selling physical copies of games appeared first on Destructoid.",

With its charming and retro look, chill vibe, and host of activities to partake in, it provides a little something different that few popular games these days can offer: a truly unwinding experience. And it was all made by one person.\nIt's not surprising that it's considered by many to be one of the greatest indie games to come out in recent years. Now, the developer - Eric \"ConcernedApe\" Barone - has announced what's coming in the 1.6 update. While this next update will be bringing changes for modders, it's nice to see there's some content coming to the game itself.\nhttps://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1681081013538267138\nA post on their Twitter page lays out roughly what you can expect in the next major patch. For one thing, there's going to be a new festival (no details about what it'll be, though), some new items, extra dialogue, some secrets, and the \"???\" at the bottom of the list implies there's even more in the pipeline.\nFishing is where it's at\nI must confess, I've only just started getting into Stardew Valley recently. After just a few hours, it's easy to see why it's such a popular game. Whether it's fishing in the river, diving deep into caves, or tending to crops, what ConcernedApe has done for the indie community is give us a modern take on such classics as Harvest Moon (which Stardew Valley was partly inspired by).\nCurrently, we don't know when version 1.6 will be rolling out, but hopefully, it'll be soon. Barone is also said to be working on a new project called Haunted Chocolatier, which they've been teasing since 2021.

Whenever a TV show, movie, or even cartoon wants to depict a legally distinct video game for their characters to play, they always show something that looks familiar but is entirely wrong. It’s like the uncanny valley of video games.\nIt shows a charming unfamiliarity with the medium. However, when it happens in an actual game, you realize that couldn’t be possible. Someone who has to be familiar with other games made this. Looking like an accident was, in fact, an accident.\n1990’s Pit-Fighter has an excuse.

          "description": "Nowhere to go but up\nTernox has released their ‘80s immersed finance sim, Stonks-9800, today on Early Access.\nYou’ll probably need a deep breath after groaning and/or sighing at that meme-inspired name. After your lungs reinflate, take a look, because Stonks-9800 is a pretty neat-looking concept.\nEconomic sims aren’t necessarily a new thing, with the earliest titles dating back to the days of mainframe computers. However, we’ve recently been receiving some interesting new twists, like Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator. Stonks-9800 takes the concept back to Japan’s economic bubble of the 1980s. It’s presented sort of as a menu-driven interactive fiction game where you buy and sell things like real estate and cars. The goal of the game is to improve your own standard of living while also not dying of overwork.\n[caption id=\"attachment_392114\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Ternox[/caption]\nTernox suggests that the game is going for a chill vibe, and while talk of finances tends to trigger my anxiety, I can see what they mean. If nothing else, you can unwind and play Pachinko or bet on horse races.\nI think it looks pretty great. I assume the latter half of the name, Stonks-9800, is a reference to the NEC PC-9800, which was a ubiquitous computer throughout the 1980s in Japan. However, I could do without the meme interest. How about “Super Zaibatsu 9800” or “The Death and Return of Wallstreet Kid.” Maybe I’m the uncool one here.\nStonks-9800 is available right now via Steam Early Access. The full release should launch in 2024 and will appear on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch.\nThe post Financial simulator Stonks-9800 hits Early Access today appeared first on Destructoid.",

An alleged perpetrator was eventually caught. However, the hacker accused of the leak may not be standing trial.\nIn a report from Reuters, Arion Kurtaj—the 18-year-old who is believed to have hacked a number of big companies—has been declared \"not fit to stand trial,\" after being assessed by psychiatrists. The report goes on to say that the jury will determine whether he committed the acts alleged, rather than determine whether he is guilty or not guilty.\nAlongside the GTA 6 leak, Kurtaj has been accused of 12 offenses. He's also been accused, along with an unnamed 17-year-old, of blackmailing BT, one of the UK's biggest internet providers. The 17-year-old will be standing trial on two counts of blackmail, two counts of fraud, and three charges under the UK's Computer Misuse Act.\nRockstar needed to plug this leak\nWhen the news that GTA 6 footage had been leaked, Rockstar issued a message on social media. The post said that the company had \"suffered a network intrusion,\" at the hands of an \"unauthorized third party\", which \"illegally accessed and downloaded confidential information from our systems.\"\nMany immediately had access to plenty of footage from an early development build of Grand Theft Auto 6. As huge as the leak was for both Rockstar and parent company Take-Two Interactive, it didn't deter the studio, which is still working on the anticipated GTA 5 follow-up. The accused hacker was arrested not long after the leak, but pleaded not guilty at the time.\nThe post Alleged GTA 6 hacker deemed ‘not fit’ to stand trial appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A bit of a blunder, it seems\nWhen it released in 2020, reviews for The Last of Us: Part 2 were favorable, with particular high praise for its bold storytelling. However, if there's one major criticism, it's that Naughty Dog's lauded series has been exclusive to the PlayStation.\nTrue that the remake of the first game, The Last of Us: Part 1, did come to PC earlier this year, but its glaring issues were a sight for sore eyes. But something may be happening with the sequel, and the cat may have been let out of the proverbial bag by the game's composer.\nIn a recent interview with the YouTube channel BLENDER, Gustavo Santaolalla, who did the music for both TLoU entries, may have accidentally let slip that a new version of The Last of Us: Part 2 is on the horizon. During one section, one of the hosts expresses their delight that the composer makes a cameo in Part 2.\nSantaolalla then says, perhaps without thinking, that in the \"new editions,\" via ResetEra, players will be able to interact with his character. More specifically, they can make him play some specific music. That section of the interview takes place around the 1:36:20 mark.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb34hYjJ-Wk&t=5779s\nWait, what?\nImmediately after this, Santaolalla then says that he can't tell the interviewers anything. It sounds like some information about a new version of The Last of Us: Part 2 may have been accidentally leaked by someone who worked on the game.\nWhat this could mean is anyone's guess. Obviously, we can't say for certain what, if anything, he was referring to. Though it's hard to see it as anything other than something maybe being on the horizon for Part 2.\nIt's unlikely to be a remaster seeing as the game is only three years old, so a PC port or director's cut could be a possibility. That's just speculation, though. Nothing official has been said at the time of writing.\nThe post The Last of Us: Part 2 composer hints at a new edition of the game appeared first on Destructoid.",

Pre-orders will become available for the controller starting on July 21.\n[caption id=\"attachment_391877\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image by Sony[/caption]\nPS5's New Access Controller to Launch on December 6\nThe controller is going for a price of $89.99 and features 8 onboard buttons for its disc-shaped design. The control stick, which can be replaced with a joystick design, sits on the side. The controller allows for up to 30 control profiles, as well as toggleable commands. The controller also supports four 3.5mm expansion ports that allow for external devices to issue commands as well.\nThe Access controller is also able to adjust its control stick length, as well as including attachments for an AMPS Pattern mount. The Access controller can also be used in conjunction with the DualSense, to allow for more customization options. Up to two access controllers can be used in conjunction with a single DualSense.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KUmHFU51NU\nEach cap on the controller can also be switched out, changing their form factor, and the icon on the cap. This allows for buttons to match the on-screen display without a need for marking the device or purchasing third-party replacements. Each cap has multiple textures as well, as described on the controller's page.\nThis is a massive jump in accessibility for PlayStation. Combining this with the accessibility options in their first-party titles, Sony opens the door for more players to experience games on its platforms. Xbox has a similar device in its adaptive controller, which has received awards for its design. These tools make it easier for everyone to engage with games, removing barriers and making this hobby more accessible in the process.\nThe post PS5’s Access controller launches on December 6 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Tons of original games were being released left and right, and although the 3DS was helping Nintendo stay relevant, the Wii U sadly never caught on. Throughout that time the company tried all sorts of experiments, including selling three Pikmin shorts in a bundle for $4.99 on both of the aforementioned platforms. While those eShops went kaput a while back, Nintendo didn't just pull a tax writeoff and chuck them into the ether: no, they put them up on YouTube for free. In anticipation of Pikmin 4, you can watch them now!\nIf you're curious, one of the reasons these shorts caught on worldwide is the Mr. Bean/Shaun the Sheep effect. They contain no spoken words, so anyone can enjoy them. They also tie into the first two games nicely, without requiring any prior knowledge of the series to \"get.\" In other words, they're perfectly crafted for Pikmin newcomers and veterans alike. Based on stats from multiple Nintendo-based YouTube channels, \"Occupational Hazards\" is far and away the most popular one if you want to start there.\nYou can catch all three of them below: no 3DS/Wii U required!\nPikmin Short: Treasure in a Bottle\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANpP2PebOW0\nPimin Short: Occupational Hazards\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=233Z0WhDrak\nTest\nPikmin Short: The Night Juicer\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEbPAXTYhcg\n[Thanks for the reminder, Nintendo Life]\nThe post Oh yeah, Nintendo made a few Pikmin shorts, and you can watch them for free appeared first on Destructoid.",

There's pretty much been enough information about Bethesda's anticipated sci-fi RPG to fill a 1,000-page compendium. However, it turns out that the majority of the people working on the game are not allowed to actually reveal a lot of detail about it.\nThat's according to a tweet from Emil Pagliarulo, the design director for Starfield. In a couple of recent posts, it's been noted that many fans have been wanting further information about the upcoming release. Unfortunately, Pagliarulo has said that only Todd Howard is \"authorized to talk publicly about unreleased game info,\" adding that it does frustrate him that he's unable to answer a lot of people's questions.\nhttps://twitter.com/Dezinuh/status/1679551395752558592\nA third tweet says that, no matter how much he'd like to, Pagliarulo is unable to share anything about Starfield's performance, the content itself, or \"well, most things,\" as per his NDA. There's no mention of whether anyone else at Bethesda has signed non-disclosure agreements, but it's more than likely they will have done in preparation for Starfield.\nBut it's still not coming to PlayStation\nOne thing that has been clear throughout the game's development is its exclusivity with Xbox. For those who don't have a powerful enough PC, and/or have a PS5, there's currently no chance in hell you'll get to experience Starfield, despite Microsoft saying it could easily shift millions of units on the rival console.\nIn any case, it hasn't stopped it from being the hype juggernaut that it currently is. No one can really blame Todd Howard for wanting the final say in what gets mentioned about Starfield, but it's also understandable why those directly working on the game would be frustrated they can't answer fan questions about it.\nThe post ‘Only Todd Howard himself’ can publicly talk about Starfield details, says design director appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Who hurt you?\nTurning beloved children’s characters into horror monsters isn’t something new. I think “nightmarish Alice in Wonderland” has been done roughly a bajillion times. So, My Friendly Neighborhood’s idea of murderous Sesame Street puppets may not seem that novel. Except that’s not what it’s about. I know. It kind of took me by surprise.\nI’d also say it’s “My First Resident Evil,” and the argument could be made, but that’s selling the game short. My Friendly Neighborhood wears its inspirations, sure, but it’s more than just a horror game made friendly for a younger audience. Its themes of non-violence, its goofy characters, and its approach to horror all convey much more depth than you — or certainly I — might’ve expected.\n[caption id=\"attachment_391837\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"64…",

The developer, Angel Matrix, recently announced that the game will be receiving a physical release soon. Depending on what version you buy, you can also expect a few extras.\n[caption id=\"attachment_391922\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot by Destructoid.[/caption]\nWhat you get with Neon White's physical edition\nThe physical editions for the PS5 and Nintendo Switch launch on September 12 this year. If you grab it at retail stores, you'll receive a bonus 11 by 17 inches poster by Rebecca Ryan. It launches with a $39.99 price tag.\nPre-orders for exclusive iam8bit versions are available for preorder. Both the Switch and PS5 versions include a physical copy of the game along with five anime-style \"character peeker\" stickers, music by Machine Girl, and a cover sheet by Rebecca Ryan. Both versions of the iam8bit exclusive cost $44.99, and they will be available in this year's fourth quarter.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmofCFI3JuQ\nXbox players shouldn't despair, as it appears a port is on the way. Eagle-eyed fans have spotted an ESRB rating for Neon White that includes the Xbox Series X/S, suggesting that developers haven't forgotten about the platform.\nFor gamers looking for a unique FPS, Neon White is a critically acclaimed title worth checking out. This physical release comes at a time when studios are opting to not include physical versions of titles. This is the case with Remedy Entertainment which currently has no plans to release physical editions of Alan Wake 2.\nThe post Neon White is getting a physical edition appeared first on Destructoid.",

Its announcement was one of the biggest surprises of Summer Game Fest, and after getting to go hands-on with it during SGF’s Play Days event, we came away excited about the blue blur’s latest adventure. \nNow, Sega has released the game's opening animation. Check it out for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Sonic Superstars features a Sonic CD-esque opening, with its bright blue skies and emerald green plains. After dashing through some enemies, Sonic joins his buddy Tails before teaming up with the rest of the Sonic Superstars playable cast, Knuckles and Amy. Together, the four prepare to take Eggman on before speeding toward the screen. \nThe trailer ends with the news that if you preorder the game, you’ll receive an “exclusive Lego Eggman in-game character skin, acrylic display stand, and reversible cover.” This preorder bonus will go great with the other Lego Sonic Superstars skins coming to the game as DLC. \nSega has yet to reveal a release date for Sonic Superstars but it’s due out sometime this fall on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.\nWhile waiting to learn more, read about how Microsoft, at one point, considered acquiring Sega, and then read about why we think Sonic’s latest outing, Sonic Origins Plus, is two steps forward and one step back. \nAre you picking up Sonic Superstars on day one?

As for why, publisher Humble Games and developer Summerfall Studios says it is taking the extra week to work on performance parity across all platforms and to allow players the space to play Larian Studios’ upcoming RPG, Baldur’s Gate 3. \n\n\nHere’s what Humble Games and Summerfall Studios have to say about the Stray Gods delay: \nFor the uninitiated, Stray Gods is a hand-illustrated role-playing musical where players will decide lines in songs, similar to picking dialogue choices in an RPG. The music is composed by Grammy-nominated composer Austin Wintory (Journey, The Pathless, Assassin’s Creed Syndicate), Tripod, and Montaigne. \nThese songs are performed by a cast filled with names you might recognize, too, like Troy Baker, Ashley Johnson, Rahul Kohli, Janina Gavankar, Felicia Day, and more. Laura Bailey voices the lead, Grace, a college dropout in the game’s modern fantasy world granted the power of a Muse. This power is what Grace uses to “find out the truth behind her predecessor’s death before time runs out,” according to a press release.\nStray Gods: The Role-Playing Musical hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on August 10, 2023. \nWill you check out Stray Gods: The Role-Playing Musical next month?

          "description": "The Clock Tower series is a favorite among horror game aficionados, but the first game has never been released outside of Japan. That finally changes as the 1995 classic is getting spruced up for a modern, international re-release.\nFor any Americans thinking, “But we got the first Clock Tower on PlayStation,” we actually didn’t. The 1997 game known as “Clock Tower,” which did release in the West, was really Clock Tower 2 and was titled as such in Japan (watch us play it in this classic episode of Replay).\nThe actual first game arrived on Super Famicom (SNES) and stars Jennifer Simpson, an orphan adopted by the Barrows family only to find that a murderous stalker called the Scissorman is terrorizing their mansion. As a point-and-click adventure, you use a mouse cursor to guide Jennifer and interact with your surroundings to solve puzzles and find clues while evading the Scissorman. The game also features multiple endings. Clock Tower is considered one of the forefathers of survival horror and has been ported to different platforms, such as PC and the Wii/Wii U eShops, several times in Japan. \n\n\nWayforward is handling this port, which is being made using Limited Run Games’ Carbon Engine. As discussed in the developer diary video above, improvements include the game's first official English localization (along with multiple language options), a new animated intro, motion-comic cutscenes, and a new vocalized theme song by famed anime and Silent Hill singer Mary McGlynn. It also includes an art gallery, save states, and other modern tweaks. \nClock Tower is coming early next year for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC. Limited Run Games is also releasing premium physical versions of the game.",

Wesley played through the demo multiple times, using each character to take down AI and robots alike. He, Marcus, and Kyle discuss the game's visual style, use of lanes in combat, fully-voiced characters, and more. \nEnjoy roughly 12 minutes of all new Ra Ra Boom gameplay in the latest NGT below: \n\n\nIn 2008, Chris Bergman, who later co-founded Gylee Games and now works as its CEO, bought the domain to raraboom.com. Today, that site takes you to the Steam page for Ra Ra Boom, the beat 'em up featured in our latest installment of New Gameplay Today. Gylee Games started work on the game back in 2019, before the resurgence of beat 'em up games, but Bergman is stoked about said resurgence. He calls it a \"rising tides raise all ships\" scenario. \nAfter playing through this demo multiple times, I'm excited for Ra Ra Boom's full release. Its inclusion of lanes has fixed my largest problem with beat 'em ups: my inability to properly target and hit enemies. Add in the fully voiced characters, beautiful art style, fun cast of ninja cheerleaders, and an emphasis on story that's somewhat rare in the genre, and I'm ready to smash some robots. \nRa Ra Boom hits PC early next year.\nFor more previews and discussions of some of the biggest games of 2023 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons, Mortal Kombat 1, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective, Eternights, Bramble: The Mountain King, Humanity, Afterimage, Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster Collection, XDefiant, Sea of Stars, and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.\nEditor's Note: This article has been updated to reflect that Ra Ra Boom will launch early 2024. \nAre you going to check out Ra Ra Boom later this year?

The upcoming ghost-busting adventure has a new trailer revealing a November 7 launch date. \nThe game stars Antea Duarte and Red mac Raith, two lovers who serve as Banishers, those who protect the living from the lingering spirits of the dead. Unfortunately, Antea has become a ghost herself and must work alongside Red to find a way to bring herself back to life. Along the way, they’ll explore New Eden, a North American settlement teeming with supernatural dangers, and player combat threats using Red’s conventional weaponry and Antea’s spectral abilities. Players will also interact with New Eden’s residents in choice-driven conversations that steer the course of the narrative, namely in deciding whether to fulfill their duty as a Banisher or sacrifice that oath to restore Antea’s mortality.  \n\n\nBanishers: Ghosts of New Eden will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. It's the second of three games on Don't Nod's 2023 launch schedule, having released Harmony: The Fall of Reverie last month and it has a meditative climbing game called Jusant slated for this fall.",

The game is set in New York City after it's been destroyed by nuclear war. Brawlers Billy and Jimmy set out to take back what remains from the violent gangs that have since taken over. However, they won't be doing it alone because the game features a roster of 13 playable fighters, including love interest Marian, newcomer Uncle Matin, and more. \nSecret Base says the beat 'em up features \"seamless tag team abilities and a multitude of strategies for devastating combos, defensive, and offensive moves.\" Players can swap characters on the fly, which you can see in the NGT above, as needed in combat. \nDouble Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC on July 27.

Now, shortly after the ruling, Microsoft has announced it will pause its appeal efforts against the Competition and Markets Authority in the U.K. so that it and the CMA can negotiate. \nBack in April, the UK regulatory body blocked Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard over cloud gaming concerns. With a July 18 deadline for the acquisition, Microsoft theoretically needs to either mark the U.K. out of its market as it relates to this purchase or negotiate a deal with the CMA to quell the regulator's concerns. Microsoft was previously set to appear in court to appeal the CMA's block on July 28. According to Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith, that won't be happening now as the two parties will instead attempt to negotiate a deal that satisfies both. \nOur statement on the mutual request with the CMA for a pause of our appeal in the UK: pic.twitter.com/8Aky2IJjxS\nJuly 11, 2023\nIt's important to note that the Competition Appeal Tribunal still needs to either approve or deny this request, as noted by The Verge, but the former seems incredibly likely. In a statement received by The Verge, the CMA said it is \"ready to consider any proposals from Microsoft to restructure the transaction in a way that would address the concerns set our in our Final Report,\" likely alluding to its concerns over cloud gaming (concerns that Microsoft disagrees with). \nGame Informer has reached out to the CMA for a statement regarding Smith's announcement and will update the story if a comment or statement is received. \nWhat do you think this means for Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard?

          "description": "Tuatara Games has revealed its next project, and it’s a sci-fi survival shoot ‘em up called Let Them Come: Onslaught. \nTuatara Games has released games before – it released Bare Butt Boxing this May – but it’s perhaps best known for its work as a AAA VFX support studio working on games like Valorant, Fortnite, Godfall, and more. It’s set to release Let Them Come: Onslaught on PC via Steam Early Access in the first quarter of 2024. Let Them Come: Onslaught puts players behind the gun of a lone survivor on an alien planet who must survive hordes of creatures by activating nukes to blow up the planet. \nCheck out the teaser trailer for Let Them Come: Onslaught for yourself below:\n\n\nTuatara Games says the game features dynamic weather, and a wide range of weapons, including a flamethrower, laser beam, electric grenade, orbital strikes, and more. As you mow down hordes of aliens, you can upgrade your soldier with increased health, defense, reduced weapon cooldowns, and shields you can activate on the battlefield. To obtain these upgrades, you spend XP you earn on each run.\n“We are huge fans of this emerging gameplay experience, and are thrilled to reveal our love letter to the games that inspired us,” Tuatara Games founder Klemen Lozar writes in a press release. “Using our team’s VFX expertise, survivors can expect to fight for their lives through adrenaline-inducing experiences that have the best visuals of the genre.” \n\nLet Them Come: Onslaught also features roguelite elements, meaning a lot will be lost in between each run. However, credits collected on the battlefield stay with you, and you can spend them on permanent upgrades in the Armory. \nTuatara Games says Let Them Come: Onslaught hits Steam Early Access sometime in Q1 of 2024. It will cost $4.99. The team says, “The decision to launch first on Early Access comes from [the] continued knowledge in incorporating improvements to ensure the final 1.0 launch is as optimized as possible.”",

          "description": "EA Sports UFC 5 has been officially announced by Electronic Arts. The fifth iteration was long-presumed to be in-development, but during the UFC's tentpole International Fight Week event over the weekend, EA Sports and the UFC made it official. While no additional details were revealed outside of the logo, we know that a full reveal is coming in September of this year.\nEA Sports UFC 5 marks the longest gap between entries since the series' introduction. Since the first EA Sports UFC game arrived in 2014, the games have arrived every two years, with UFC 2 arriving in 2016, UFC 3 in 2018, and UFC 4 in 2020. The series has traditionally been developed by EA Vancouver, so that's the expectation with this entry as well, but no official confirmation has been provided by EA one way or the other on that front. EA Sports UFC 5 will also mark the first game in the series to launch since the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S hit the market, so we might be able to expect a leap forward in terms of graphical fidelity and/or performance.\nEA Sports UFC 4 launched on August 14, 2020, and introduced various customization options, as well as new grappling and takedown physics, plus a more fleshed-out single-player career mode. EA Sports has also continually updated the game's roster, adding tens of new fighters to the game in the time since its launch, with the most recent free update featuring Jack Della Maddalena, Erin Blanchfield, and Brandon Royval arriving just last week. For more on our thoughts on EA Sports UFC 4, check out our review here.\nWe'll learn more about EA Sports UFC 5 in September, but in the meantime, what do you hope is fixed, improved upon, or included in the next game? Let your thoughts be known in the comments below!",

          "description": "EA has announced that a Black Panther game is in the works. The title is being made by Cliffhanger Games, a new triple-A studio based in Seattle, in collaboration with Marvel Games.\nThe upcoming title is billed as a single-player story-driven third-person action-adventure game. In a press release, Cliffhanger states that “Our mission is to build an expansive and reactive world that empowers players to experience what it is like to take on the mantle of Wakanda’s protector, the Black Panther.”\nCliffhanger is led by Kevin Stephens, formerly of Monolith Productions (a studio currently making a Wonder Woman game), and consists of veteran talent who have worked on titles such as Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, God of War, Halo Infinite, and Call of Duty, among others. The team is still being assembled and is actively hiring. As such, this untitled Black Panther project is very early in development, so it will be a few years before it’s in our hands. \n“We’re dedicated to delivering fans a definitive and authentic Black Panther experience, giving them more agency and control over their narrative than they have ever experienced in a story-driven video game. Wakanda is a rich SuperHero sandbox, and our mission is to develop an epic world for players who love Black Panther and want to explore the world of Wakanda as much as we do,” said Kevin.\nBlack Panther made his comic debut in July 1966, and today’s news coincides with the character’s 57th anniversary. Although he’s been a playable character in numerous Marvel titles, he’s never starred in his own solo game until now. However, it's not the only upcoming game to let players assume the Black Panther mantle. Last year, Amy Hennig's Skydance New Media announced it’s making a Marvel game set during World War II starring Captain America, Black Panther Azzuri (the grandfather of T’Challa), alongside another Wakandan spy and Howling Commando member Gabriel Jones. \nTo keep up with other upcoming superhero games, we've made a list of them for you to check out here.",

          "description": "Sonic the Hedgehog co-creator Yuji Naka has been given a suspended prison sentence for insider trading.\nNews of this sentencing comes from IGN (via IGN Japan), which reports that the 57-year-old was \"found guilty of violating Japan's Financial Instruments and Exchange Act\" for insider trading after a July 7 court appearance at the Tokyo District Court. The judge in the case gave Naka a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence but suspended for four years, and two fines of 2 million yen and 170 million yen (approximately $14,000 and $1.1 million respectively). \nThis sentencing comes roughly a month after Abema Times reported in June that prosecutors on the case were asking that Naka go to prison for two years and six months and fines totaling roughly $1.2 million. However, Naka's defense asked that this fine and prison sentence be reduced. The final verdict arrived on July 7 in Japan. \nNaka, who also directed Balan Wonderworld, was arrested in November in connection to an insider trading investigation centered around a new Dragon Quest game. Naka was accused of purchasing 10,000 shares worth 2.8 million yen (roughly $20,000) in Aiming, the company behind that new mobile Dragon Quest game. \nLess than a month later, Naka was arrested once more on a second charge of insider trading; this time involving the now-defunct mobile battle royale, Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier. Naka was accused of purchasing 120,000 shares in Ateam, the developer behind the game, for approximately 144.7 million yen (more than $1 million). \nNaka has now been formally charged and sentenced for insider trading. \n[Source: IGN via IGN Japan]",

The following year, at The Game Awards 2021, Bokeh revealed Slitterhead. Thanks to a new development diary released today, we can peek at more early-development gameplay in action. \nMost of the video focuses on the developers working on Slitterhead, with a particular look at user tests and gameplay feedback. However, sprinkled throughout the diary are new clips of Slitterhead, ranging from training room-esque encounters, some clips of a neon-lit Chinese city, and even a dog that appears to be playable. \nCheck it out for yourself: \n\n\nAs you can see in the small and often blurred snippets of Slitterhead gameplay, the studio's debut game continues to look grotesque. We see a character attack enemies using Wolverine-like claws, guns, and more. Oh, and below is that playable dog: \nIn 2020, the studio said its debut horror game would be released in 2023. But there's no word on whether the team still anticipates releasing it this year.

In it, we witness Scorpion and Sub-Zero's further attempts to establish this faction in Liu Kang's newly rebooted Mortal Kombat universe (hence the Mortal Kombat 1 title), where Smoke and Rain come into play. \nCheck these two fighters out in the Lin Kuei gameplay trailer below: \n\n\n\"With deep ties to Scorpion and Sub-Zero, Smoke has made the clan's mission his own and joins his Lin Kuei brethren in defense of Earthrealm,\" a press release reads. \"The trailer also provides a first look at Rain, the High Mage of Outworld who has honed his craft of water magic into a fierce weapon and now hopes to learn the realm's darkest and most powerful sorcery.\" \nElsewhere in the trailer, you might have spotted Sektor, Cyrax, Frost, and Scorpion as Kameo fighters. \n\nMortal Kombat 1 hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store on September 19, 2023. \nFor more about the game, watch Game Informer's Mortal Kombat 1 New Gameplay Today and then read our preview thoughts on the game after going hands-on with it.",

          "description": "Despite having pretty enjoyable gameplay, AEW: Fight Forever is woefully light on features and modes. That gets remedied a bit with the announcement that Stadium Stampede is hitting the game in an upcoming free update. \nStadium Stampede sees up to 30 wrestlers compete in a free-for-all inside a giant empty stadium. Like the real-life version, insanity is the name of the game, as players can assault each other using whatever is around them, whether it's chairs, tee shirt guns, Molotovs, golf carts, or even ride atop a horse. The last competitor standing wins, and the reveal trailer sells how much of a goofy mess it’s going to be (in a good way, hopefully). \n\n\nUnfortunately, there's no release date for this update other than that it's coming soon. AEW: Fight Forever has other DLC heading its way in the form of downloadable wrestler packs. FTR (Dax Harwood and Cash Wheeler) were added last month, and a pack containing Keith Lee and The Bunny becomes available on July 25. The final announced pack arrives on August 22 and adds Hook and Danhausen. Each of these packs also includes two new minigames. Each pack costs $11.99 and is included with the season pass. \nFor more on AEW: Fight Forever, check out our review here.",

But a recent report from Kotaku suggests that the company's commitment to the franchise might be going even deeper than we thought; Ubisoft has recently begun the process of remaking Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. \nThe remake is currently in \"its earliest stages,\" Kotaku reports, so details are scarce, and we won't be seeing it officially for a few years. A team at Ubisoft Singapore, a branch that has contributed to almost every mainline Assassin's Creed game, is said to be heavily involved. Most notably, Ubisoft Singapore worked on the creation of naval combat for Assassin's Creed III and IV, a success that would place it at the head of development for Ubisoft's naval-focused game, Skull and Bones. Of course, Skull and Bones is now notorious for its years of repeated delays – fans of Black Flag will just have to hope the seas will be calmer for the studio's next project.\n\n\nBlack Flag was released in 2013 on the eve of a new console generation, coming to PS3 and 360, but also to PS4, Xbox One, and Wii U. The game follows Edward Kenway – the pirate grandfather of the protagonist Connor from Assassin's Creed III – as he plunders the Caribbean and stumbles into the Assassin Brotherhood. Combining the series' classic stealth gameplay with naval exploration and combat, it's widely regarded as one of the franchise's best entries.

          "description": "Adibou, the first game in the beloved children's series, is now ready for public testing!\nAlso known as Adi Jr.'s World of Discoveries, this 1991 Coktel Vision title began the educational Adibou collection aimed at children of age 4 to 7 years.\nMany of the iconic activities and mechanisms of the series were already part of this first opus: planting flowers, playing the game Breakout, and being rewarded with sweets upon completing Read/Count exercises. And of course, this was Adibou's first appearance! Although the floppy release has him speak the same strange gibberish as heard in the Goblins series, he is still the patient and funny learning partner that he's remembered for being in later games.\nScummVM supports all of the game's releases, from the initial 16-color floppy ones to later 1994 CD versions with richer graphics and sound effects. So dig out your dusty Adibou disks, get a ScummVM daily development build, and start collecting sweets while completing math and reading exercises! Please also contact us if you own a version ScummVM is not yet aware of, and report to the issue tracker any problem you may encounter.\nAs much as ScummVM aims to replicate the original gaming experience, there is one feature we are unfortunately unable to support. When hardworking children complete their virtual sweets collection, a message invites them to mail a floppy disk with their savegame to Coktel Vision, who would send them a parcel containing Coktel goodies and actual sweets! So if you are introducing children to Adibou through ScummVM, be prepared to go to the nearest shop and buy some candy for when they finish the game!\n>",

In this post I want to take you with me why this migration was needed, what the benefits are, and why you possibly care.

Faster download speeds for you (ranging from the in-game content service to downloading the game from our website). Easier maintainability of our infrastructure with thanks to Pulumi.
