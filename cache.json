A supergroup of creators teaming up to make a game in the genre they helped define. Shinji Mikami, father of the Resident Evil franchise, joining Suda51, one of Japanese game development's most unique voices. Akira Yamaoka, beloved composer of the Silent Hill series, was also on board. How could this possibly not be another survival horror masterpiece?\nUnfortunately, publisher demands twisted their collaboration into something more commercially viable. Starting as a traditional horror experience called Kurayami, Grasshopper Manufacture's anticipated title ended up being a gonzo shooter in which Mikami and Suda’s signature was diluted. A flawed yet enjoyable experience that has since garnered a cult following, Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered joins Suda 51’s Lollipop Chainsaw RePop as a flawed yet enjoyable Switch remaster.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Their forthcoming Love Eternal is the story of Maya, a girl whisked off to a \"castle built of bitter memories\" by a weird, lonely god, and obliged to make her way \"through over 100 screens filled with spikes, lasers, switches, and traps\".\nWhen not getting spiked or lasered, Maya appears to spend her days in a kind of metaphorical suburban household. Here, she will contend with things like people crawling on the ceiling and coming over all Babadook. Maya does have one major advantage: the ability to reverse gravity. Watch her put that ability to use in the new trailer.\n Read more",

It's a third-person action adventure where two famous video game folks joined forces: No More Heroes' Suda51 and Resident Evil's Shinji Mikami. And to my knowledge, it's considered a bit of a cult classic.\nSo, having played Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered after never experiencing the original, do I think it's any good? If you were a fan of the OG, there's no doubt you'll like it. If you're coming in as a newbie, I think it's refreshing in the sense it's a trim throwback with some interesting ideas and middling-to-good execution.

All bright and fuzzy and with plenty of alien weirdness to hop over or battle, with lots of FMV cutscenes to bring those colourful characters closer to your eyeballs.

This puzzle-solving sequel, Wilmot Works It Out, doesn't come packaged with its predecessor's wry humour, nor the same sense of compulsion. Instead, it exudes a calm and homely sense of idle comfort. For me, that ultimately makes it less compelling, even if it is thematically the entire point. This is about a warehouse worker doing jigsaws on his day off.\nRead more",

In case you're unfamiliar, Denuvo's wares have become infamous for allegedly sabotaging the performance of all sorts of video games, from Resident Evil: Village to Tekken 7, though accounts of the severity vary, and there is an on-going shortage of independently supplied raw data. \nDenuvo's attempts to clear the air include opening a Discord, which they say “ is a key step in fostering closer relationships with game developers, publishers, and players, offering a dynamic, real-time platform for meaningful interaction”. On Monday, Denuvo’s media team reached out to me to offer an interview with Denuvo’s product manager, Andreas Ullmann. Here’s that interview, edited for brevity. \nRPS: In a recent public statement you said “we will stop letting every claim about our product go unanswered\". What claims are you referring to?\nAndreas Ullmann: It's basically really about the stuff that's posted by the community. So you just need to check out Steam forums, for example. Very toxic, very hostile environment. If a game announces to use any of our products, if you check out the Steam forums, all the claims are popping in. SSDs are destroyed by our solution. The usual performance topics, and we simply don't want to leave the floor to these people who are posting all things about us anymore. We want to also be there for a person who has not heard about us before. We also want to share our view, our opinion on these topics, and also act as a trusted source of information.\nRead more",

At least, I think he's an odd flag-bearer for a series of games where you live out a nostalgic, Japanese summer in the countryside.\nAnd I think it's doubly weird that Shin chan: Shiro And The Coal Town opts for a collectathon approach, that doesn't necessarily make the act of living out a Cicada Summer all that mesmerising.

It's one of your 'cursed video game' videogames in the spirit of Inscryption and Pony Island, and based on a quick blast with the demo, it seems lush.\nIt's set in the 1980s, a premise I now automatically find horrible because I was born in the 1980s and that was, like, a million years ago. You're a kid who's playing a legendary 8-bit game that's said to be possessed by evil spirits. The experience sees you alternating between the surprisingly labyrinthine space of the game, and the increasingly threatening environment of your bedroom, where terrible toys abound. Did you have one of those phones on wheels with eyes as a kid? Whoever invented that deserves a spell in Arkham Asylum.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Not many people hit the refund button on Sonar Shock, the indie immersive sim that’s rated Very Positive on Steam. But those that do tend to complain they couldn’t get the hang of the controls. You can understand why. Try to strafe left to dodge an attack from a blubber monster, and you’ll instead rotate on the spot. Attempt to turn the camera with a flick of the mouse, and you’ll discover that your view remains fixed in place - the cursor moving across the screen as if searching for an icon on your desktop.\n\"The controls are actually one of the biggest points that make people bounce off the game,\" developer Raphael Bossniak admits.\nAnd yet they’re also a unique selling point. Where last year’s extraordinary System Shock remake embraced the interface and keyboard conventions of modern gaming, Sonar Shock leans into the experimentation of pre-Quake control schemes - long before WASD and mouselook became standardised for the sake of ease and sanity.\nRead more",

A post on the game's Steam page yesterday reads: \"{n} purple wardens beseech the Chair, What is death, if one rose is fair? How long from beetle moon to beetle moon?\" That means absolutely nothing to me. But at least one fan in the comments knows their lore enough to have translated it, resulting in a specific date later this year. If their solution is correct, this could be a characteristically cryptic way for developer Freehold Games to announce the date for the roguelike's 1.0 release.

          "description": "Back in the protean stink of 2013, the beast we call Factorio sprouted in lowercase early access form and began its meticulous, ravenous conquest of the emerging factory sim genre. Some say that Factorio gave that genre life, though I'd point at Dwarf Fortress as one among many notable forebears. Today, the terrain of factory simming is hotly contested by rival piles of conveyor belt spaghetti. I'm not just talking about Satisfactory or Shapez - they're even making philosophical factory sims these days. They have cosy factory sims now.\nAccordingly, the immense, smoke-rimmed cyborg eye of Factorio has turned from the exhausted soil to the relatively untapped heavens. Somewhere up there, there is unspoilt territory. Somewhere, there is land that has never known the roar of a smelter - and in Factorio's behemothic Space Age DLC, out today, you will find it.\n Read more",

Take a standard game of chance you might find in any casino and mash an uncountable number of bells and whistles and gizmos and weirdnesses into it, then slather it in a \"one more turn\" roguelike dressing, and make it as tactile and punchy as humanly possible. The ongoing Steam Next Fest has no shortage of these gambley gimmickers, but here's one demo that stood out. Ballionaire is a colourful pachinko-inspired roguelike, but you choose where the wacky widgets will go.\nRead more",

It elicits adrenaline almost as much as it forces murder economics down your piehole.

Like Moses descending from the mount with a Needler in either hand, he bedazzled and amazed us with visions of \"an enormous playground stitched together from some of Halo's most iconic maps of yore; Warthogs and Mongooses roaming the lands; players racing to the M41 SPNKR as it spawns; grappling to a rooftop and laying down covering fire; some contrived reason as to why there's a circle of poison gas closing in... but hey, rings are what Halo does best, right? It's 100% doable.\"\nEd Thorn has always been a journalist of great sagacity and supernatural insight, so it was of no surprise to the RPS editors of the era when rumours bubbled up a few months later that Certain Affinity had partnered with 343 Industries (nowadays Halo Studios) to make Halo battle royale a reality. These rumours have now been confirmed by Certain Affinity's former design director Mike Clopper, who says the now-cancelled mode could have been a \"game changer\".\n Read more",

At the time of the \"parting of ways\", Paradox chief operational officer Charlotta Nilsson washed her hands of XCOMlikes entirely, commenting that \"a new project or sequel in the same genre was not in line with our portfolio plans\". \r\n \nRead more",

I did not rush the new Steam demo for Kalypso’s revival, Commandos: Origins, but it’s still doable inside half an hour. I had expected a little more, but what’s here has certainly given me some optimism that the full game might well be worth sinking - if not months - at least more time than it takes to wildly lunge at a few nazis en route to your objective.\nRead more",

This feature basically lets you play with a friend together on a single screen. \n\n\nHowever, not everyone knows how to do this, so to help you with that, we have created a comprehensive guide on how you can set up split screen and play with your friend in Black Ops 6.\n\n\nSteps to play split screen in Black Ops 6\n\n\nImage via Activision\n\n\nBefore we dive in, you should know that the split screen feature is only available to high-end consoles like PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Older consoles and PCs don’t support it.\n\n\nHere are the steps to dive into the split-screen feature in Bo6:\n\n\n\nStep 1: First things first, you should have an extra controller in order to set up the split screen. If you have the second controller, pair it up with your system.\n\n\nStep 2: Once you paired it up, open Black Ops 6. It also must be noted that you can use this feature only in Zombies and Multiplayer mode. \n\n\nStep 3: Now head either to the Zombies or Multiplayer mode.\n\n\nStep 4: Now, you will be asked to log in with your second Activision account. \n\n\nStep 5: Do all the requisite steps to log in to your account, and once it is done, you can see both accounts are joined together in the party.\n\n\n\nRemember, you won’t see a split screen until you go into a match. Once you are in the match, the screen will be divided into two halves.\n\nThe post How to play split-screen in Black Ops 6 appeared first on Destructoid.",

One such error is Dev Error 5820, which indicates the connectivity issue between the server and the client in Bo6. \n\n\nSince there are two ends of the network, the issue could lie on the server side or client side. If the Dev Error 5820 is from the client side, you can work it around by applying these possible fixes.\n\n\nHow to fix Dev Error 5820 in Call of Duty Black Ops 6\n\n\nRestart your game and system\n\n\nIf you are encountering the Dev error, try restarting your game. If it still doesn’t work, then you should try restarting your system.\n\n\nTest your connection\n\n\nSince it’s a network issue, most likely it is caused by your side or from the server side. Just for surety, run a speed test to make sure that your connection is stable. If possible, you can also try switching from Wi-Fi to a wired connection for better stability.\n\n\nFlush DNS cache (for PC users)\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nYou can try flushing the DNS cache. To do that, just search “cmd” in the search box in the Taskbar and open the Command Prompt. Once opened, simply copy this: ipconfig /flushdns. Paste it in the Command Prompt and press enter. \n\n\nReinstall the game\n\n\nIf everything fails, you should reinstall the game. If you are not playing any other titles like Warzone, Modern Warfare, etc., try uninstalling them too. \n\n\nIn case nothing works at all, then the error is occurring from the server’s side.
