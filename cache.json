          "description": "The jump hasn't been smooth.\nThe Dragon Quest series is no stranger to spin-off titles, but few are as confusing as Infinity Strash: Dragon Quest The Adventure of Dai. This action RPG is based on an anime adaptation of a manga based on the world of Dragon Quest, but it is never clear who the game is designed to appeal to. The few things it does well are buried under an avalanche of unengaging cutscenes that go on too long and simply don’t do the story they’re telling justice.\nThat isn’t to say that there aren’t some glimmers of hope hidden in this game’s runtime. The combat, for example, is competently designed if unimaginative in its implementation; characters have a basic attack, plus a selection of powers that they can unleash to deal more damage or to heal their allies. It is a system that has been used countless times before because it works well, letting you feel powerful as you wade through waves of enemies on the battlefield.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Demon Turf utilized a fascinating hand-drawn 2D art style. Tinykin had you leaping and exploring bedrooms and kitchens while commanding a small army of not-Pikmin. Snake Pass tasked you with slithering around as a snake in a platformer without jumping. Super Adventure Hand fits this canon of offbeat 3D platformers like a glove, and though it isn’t an exceptional entry in the genre, it’s so bizarre that we can’t help but suggest you give it a try.\nSuper Adventure Hand begins with the titular appendage going for a woodland stroll before being accosted by the nefarious feet, who knock the hand unconscious and steal the arm it was attached to. You thus set out on a quest across various hand-themed worlds, collecting mugs along the way that (somehow?) aid you in your goal of reclaiming your arm. From the feet.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

They're sort of The Lord of the Rings, but with talking woodlands animals, and their appeal for me consisted of three things 1) comedy British accents, 2) big fights, and 3) big feasts. I couldn't get enough, to the point that I tried to have one of my unborn siblings named after a badger warcry from the novel Salamandastron.\nFast-forward to 2023, and Oregon-based Soma Games are about to release a Redwall videogame, titled The Lost Legends of Redwall: The Scout Anthology. Will it measure up to my childhood fantasies about acorn pancakes slathered with gorseflower honey, or forest logboat armadas of squabbling guerilla shrews? Probably not, but what can? Here's a new trailer from publisher Forthright Entertainment.\nRead more",

I'm not sure The Fabulous Fear Machine - devised by Fictiorama Studios in partnership with AMC and Shudder - is quite that horrifying, but it's certainly chewing on my nerve endings in an engrossing way. \r\n\n\r\nIt's a top-down management sim, which might not sound very scary, but just look at those colours - irradiated and unwholesome shades of purple and yellow, spreading over chunky, HyperCard continents emblazoned with pulp comic fonts. The visuals wear away at you like the stink of hydrochloric acid. And then there's that red-eyed, turbaned figure, gazing at you in top left. This is the face of the Fabulous Fear Machine. Its offer: to enable your character's world-toppling ambitions. Its price: that your story will become part of its story.

          "description": "What exactly is The Alters? It's a question I've been itching to get answers to ever since Frostpunk and This War Of Mine developers 11 bit Studios first announced their strange new game at notE3 last year. Until now, all we've had to go on is a cryptic CG announcement trailer that showed a gaggle of identical clone-looking men in bright pink medical gowns, all of whom seemingly live inside a giant wheel full of shipping containers. It didn't really tell us anything about what the game actually is, or how it plays, and we've heard precious little about it since. \nHappily, I've now seen about an hour of The Alters in action at this year's Gamescom, and first impressions are very promising. This is indeed a game about sort-of clones living in a big wheely shipping container, but these containers are actually modules you'll be building in XCOM/Fallout Shelter-style chunks to advance the capabilities of your big wheel base as you work to escape the broiling heatdeath that's slowly enveloping the planet. You'll also be venturing out onto the planet's surface to gather resources, all while managing your crew of clo- sorry, alternate selves - as you assign their daily work tasks, and then there's the fact that, well, you're all chuffing different versions of the same person and the literal embodiment of what your life might have been like if you'd done X instead of Y, or Y instead of Z. It's a fascinating blend of ideas, and if 11 bit can stick the landing, I reckon it could end up being something really quite special. Here's everything I learned.\nRead more",

Whether you like it or not, Valve wants you playing CS2. For those who don't take their CS all too seriously, CS2 won't seem like much of a change from CS:GO, besides some grenade changes, more detailed maps, and a disappointing lack of fan favourite game modes. And for those who train their aim on the reg and line up their smoke grenades, CS2 might look the part but lacks the precision of CS:GO's movement and gunplay.\nStill, CS2 captures what makes Counter-Strike tick and even if the foundation seems a little sparse and a touch shaky right now, I'm confident Valve have an FPS that'll supersede CS:GO in time.\nRead more",

Valhalla, although it had a relative dearth of things to parkour around, was a fun open-world RPG. Which I suppose is the point.\nAssassin's Creed hasn't been a game about a group of assassins following a creed and striking from the shadows for a long time. Here I would say that Basim, protagonist of Assassin's Creed Mirage kicks down the door and kills everyone in the room, except this new entry in the series is smaller, more focused, and once again concerned largely with stealth, and is all the better for it. So it's more appropriate to say Basim snuck in through an open window and is choking everyone out one by one.\nRead more",

My fondest memories lie with Oblivion, because I think it captured exploration beautifully. I liked emerging from a big cave as a big nobody and striking out along a cobbled path, excited to go for a summer's walk. Skyrim abandoned Oblivion's warmth for your average fantasyland, but kept the great outdoors.\nIf I don't have an objective in Starfield, I sort of freeze over and don't really know where to turn. And even if I do, I perform a deep sigh and open up my menus and curl myself into a pinball, ready to get pinged around the innards of whatever can lies beyond the airlock in front of me. So far, Starfield's adventuring forces me indoors and it's a shame.\nRead more",

In 11 bit Studio's forthcoming sequel, Frostpunk 2, the apocalypse is yesterday's news. Now you're dealing with \"what happens when you survive the un-survivable,\" as the game's co-director and design director Jakub Stokalski neatly puts it when I sit down for a hands off presentation at this year's Gamescom. And to do this, Frostpunk 2 is going big, measuring its time not in days, but weeks, months and even years.\n\"If we want to show the evolution of societies and different utopias/dystopias, we need breathing room,\" says Stokalski. \"And this breathing room really is in the scale, both in the physical sense but also in the sense of time. It's difficult to show meaningful social change in the space of a month, so the time ticks now in weeks and months, and in a long playthrough you'll get up into years, so you can see the consequences of your choices.\"\nRead more",

          "description": "In another reality, 2003's The Simpsons: Hit & Run — an action-adventure game that was by then the show's 22nd video game adaptation — might have slid quietly into obscurity. So why is it, then, that we can't seem to let it go? On YouTube, the game frequently resurfaces via longplays, speedruns, and retrospective essays that garner respectable amounts of views year after year. A few months ago, the game's lead designer told GamesRadar that he would support an official remake, mentioning that Hit & Run continues to be The Simpsons' most popular video game adaptation on Metacritic.\nYet Hit & Run's sustained relevance is, on its surface, a bit of an enigma. You'd be hard-pressed to find the game included in any critical canons or best-of lists, and there's hardly been a shortage of T-rated open-world games since its release. But for many, the game isn't just a source of nostalgia today; it was an introduction to a wholly new form of in-game self-expression. I looked into the still-growing community keeping it alive today.\nRead more",

Except these are currently limited to tedious magic shooters Forspoken and Immortals of Aveum, which is less great. \nRegardless, this could be a major moment for basically any modern graphics card that isn’t an Nvidia RTX 40 series model. FSR 3’s Fluid Motion Frames system works in a broadly similar manner to DLSS 3, piecing together whole new frames outside of the usual GPU rendering pipeline and slipping them onto your screen between the 'real' frames. The result (in theory – I’ll be trying FSR 3 out in depth next week) is higher FPS with no extra strain on your PC, and unlike Nvidia’s frame generation, it doesn’t need any specialist hardware to work.  Therefore older cards, as well as recent AMD GPUs like the RX 7700 XT and RX 7800 XT, could get a new lease of life in games that support it.\nRead more",

          "description": "During the Nintendo Direct the other week, a single game stood head and shoulders above the rest for me. It wasn't Super Mario Wonder (though that does look pretty all right for a 2D Mario game), and it wasn't F-Zero 99 (which I sort of instantly dismissed as a cheap cash-in on that most excellent of neglected Nintendo racing games but have since been told is also quite good). Rather, it was the news that the insta-sit-up-and-pay-attention pairing of Atlus and Vanillaware were making a new fantasy tactics RPG called - wait for it - Unicorn Overlord, and woah nelly, it looks absolutely incredible. Vanillaware games have always been a feast for the eyes - see Muramasa: The Demon Blade on Wii and more recently 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim on PS4 and Switch - and the thought of marrying those lovely visuals with what appears to be a pixel art mash-up of Final Fantasy Tactics and Fire Emblem? Yes please and thank you. \nI was all ready to gush about it in a news post and whack it straight into our release date calendar when I first saw it. But then my heart sank. The press release for it came through, and despite it launching on literally every other console including the Nintendo Switch, PC was not among them. My heart. It was broken.\nRead more",

Welcome to the fourth chapter of the great Starfield no-planets run, in which my character, rancid astro-buccaneer Mary Read, tries to play the entirety of Bethesda's so-big-it's-small RPG in space. When last we caught up with this galloping galactic nuisance, Mary was beginning to lose momentum. She had grown weary of happy-slapping freighter after freighter, though there's one particular wandering geologist she'd like to settle the score with. She had even lost her enthusiasm for boarding actions - the spice in every pirate's cup of grog - having mastered the art of standing at the bottom of a ladder. \r\n\n\r\nI've spent the past few days trying to cook up a proper endgame objective for Mary - some mad caper befitting a legendary space pirate and her rowdy crew of turncoats and tearaways, who absolutely aren't a bunch of corpses Mary has arranged into sitting postures and decorated with buckets. And in my desperation, I have turned to the forbidden magic of Starfield console commands - a hundred or more deceptively homely lines of text which, when typed into Starfield's in-game console (hit the tilde or @ key), can be used to perform impossible feats, like unlocking all the game's powers or becoming immortal. My initial hope was to solidify the game's weirdly intangible asteroids somehow, and build outposts on them. It's been a couple hours since then, and well, everything has gone awonk. I'm not even playing Starfield anymore. Instead, I am playing a very special, inadvertent Starfield mod of my own devising. Working title: \"Totally Fucked\".\r\n\n \nRead more",

While it might sound complex, the worlds these orbs contain steer you carefully towards a clear goal every time: solve the problem, then grab your orb on the way out. Before you know it, you're carrying orbs within orbs and you're unravelling a cosmic mystery where the floor might be a biomechanical stingray or the path forward a spinal cord composed of ferns. I am convinced everyone should spring to action and hoist an orb on their shoulders. I couldn't put mine down.\nRead more",

          "description": "As a child of the early internet, games like Hypnospace Outlaw can't help but resonate quite deeply with me. This was the internet as I remembered it, goddamnit, and the fact it mixed in a compelling corporate conspiracy story in between its pages was just the icing on an already fine cake (in GIF form, naturally, with a MIDI tune of Vivaldi's Four Seasons blaring out from your internet browser for good measure). But in revisiting Hypnospace for this month's RPS Game Club, there was one page in particular that really brought the rose-tinted shutters down on me. It was beautiful, lovely April, Hypnospace's virtual pet hamster, who can live, snooze and poop on your desktop, and maybe turn a slightly sickly shade of green if you don't pay enough attention to her.  \nAs with most things in Hypnospace, I can only assume that April and her fellow gaggle of virtual pet friends are riffs on real-life virtual pet games Catz and Dogz from the late 90s, which, yes, as a ten-year-old girl at the time, I was absolutely obsessed with. Developed by the now defunct PF Magic, Catz and Dogz 3 were arguably two of my most formative PC games growing up, and cor, I miss those dumb beasts so very much.\nRead more",

Is this kind of like when Prince of Persia went all edgelord with Warrior Within? Do I need to call Mintrocket's parents and ask for an intervention?\r\n\n\r\nThing is, if you take a step back from each game they're actually very similar. Both are fundamentally about scouring dangerous places for resources and ferrying them back to a safe area where you can sell them off. Both pit you, a mediocre human, against strange and unearthly creatures. Both are sort of about redeeming scenario concepts we all hate - in Dave the Diver's case, the water level, and in Nakwon's case, the stealth mission. See, this is practically a remake!

It introduces Dualshock 4 and DualSense controller support alongside a host of changes to enemies, the execution of the game’s Fable Arts or gear-specific special moves, item drop rates and the duration of stagger windows. The overarching aim seems to be to make the game easier, and as I’m sure you’re expecting, a few Lies of P fans - and, it turns out, RPS staffers - are ticked off about that.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "On the latest-but-one revision of their About page, Metacritic describe the process of calculating a videogame's aggregate \"Metascore\" as a kind of \"magic\". The FAQ cheekily invites you to \"peek behind the curtain\", evoking the figure of the theatre conjurer beckoning the audience on-stage to inspect the props, before performing the trick. You're only shown so much, however. There are tables for conversions between different review scoring systems, demonstrating how a B- becomes 67/100, but the \"weighting\" Metacritic gives to each source publication when producing the combined Metascore is a closely-guarded mystery.\nYou could argue that the secrecy is necessary to avoid heavily weighted publications being targeted and pestered by fans to deliver positive reviews of forthcoming games, so as to swing the average (though in practice, Metascore soothsayers have long since sussed out which outlets have the most votes). But I think it's better understood as a mixture of basic trademark protection and a mechanism of enchantment, a means of both deterring imitators and keeping avid readers guessing about the output. After all, no professional magician seriously wants to give away how the trick is performed, much as no meat magnate wants to show you the inside of a sausage factory.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "In the first of the two planned Devstreams for Diablo 4 Season 2, Blizzard revealed some pretty big changes coming to the ARPG. First, the team discussed the details of Season 2, including its new systems and content. Then a plethora of upcoming changes were discussed, most of which on the surface should improve Diablo 4 in a big way. Near the end, Blizzard casually announced that Diablo 4 would be launching on Steam at the start of Season 2. Overall I'd say it was a good Devstream. Let's go over some of the highlights!\n\n\n\n\nSeason of Blood\n\n\nThe second season of Diablo 4, Season of Blood, will go live on October 17 at 1 p.m. ET. The current season, Season of the Malignant, will also end at the same time. Furthermore, Patch 1.2.0 will also go live the same day Season 2 begins. Blizzard has …",

When Season 2, Season of Blood launches on October 17th, players will be able to download and play the ARPG through Steam. Earlier this year another Blizzard title, Overwatch 2, also came to Steam.\n\n\nAccording to Fletcher, cross-play and cross-progression will work immediately on day one. Players on Steam and Battle.net will be able to party up and play together seamlessly on the same server. Despite being on the Steam platform, it looks like players will still require a Battle.net account to activate and play. This isn't too surprising since most modern-day Blizzard titles are built around the Battle.net network.\n\n\n\n\nPlatforms for …",

          "description": "Versus Evil has announced that Jukai Studio’s horror game Stray Souls will release on October 25, 2023. It is coming to PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One platforms.\n\n\nStray Souls takes place in the town of Aspen Falls, where protagonist Daniel has inherited his Grandmother’s house. He renovates the interior and quickly sells it on the booming real estate market to afford his education.\n\n\nNo, I’m joking. The town is full of monsters. Of course it is.\n\n\n\n\nThe plot centers around Daniel discovering he’s part of a ritual that was set in motion at his birth. Stray Souls is based on Japanese survival horror games and carries a bit more than a whiff of Resident Evil and Silent Hill. However, it promises “mind-bending puzzles” and a choice-driven narrative. It’s by a small team, but it carries with it the fancy gloss of the Unreal 5 Engine. Plus, it sports the legendary Akira Yamaoka as a guest composer.\n\n\nI don’t know. The trailers show a lot of what seems familiar. The store blurb also states that its combat features “soulslike precision.” It kind of feels like its selling itself based on the merits of other games, rather than what it brings itself. Nonetheless, I like checking out horror from smaller developers, so it might be worth a look.\n\n\nStray Souls is coming to PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One on October 25, 2023.\n\nThe post Horror game Stray Souls locks in a release date of October 25 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Spike Chunsoft announced that Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island will not only be coming to the West, but also that it’s set for release on February 27, 2024. The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island — what a mouthful — will be the 6th game in the mainline Shiren the Wanderer series. The last new entry we saw in this series was The Tower of Fortune and the Dice of Fate, which came out back in 2016.\n\n\n\n\nThe announcement trailer gives insight into what this iteration of Shiren the Wanderer entails. Supposedly, a vast treasure lies in wait in the dungeon of Serpentcoil Island, and who else deserves to claim it than Shiren and Koppa? It’s adopting a chibi-fied, cartoonish aesthetic, which lines up perfectly with the “back to basics” concept the trailer mentions.\n\n\nAs with many other roguelikes, this is a game where you will die (a lot). And, if and when you do die, you also lose everything you have gathered during that run. So strategy and careful movement becomes incredibly important for your survival. Especially with procedurally generated, turn-based dungeons that reset every run. I can see several scenarios playing out in my head that would make me panic beyond imagination. \n\n\nScreenshot via Spike Chunsoft\n\n\nFor those unfamiliar with Shiren the Wanderer, it's the main pioneer of the Mystery Dungeon franchise. Western gamers likely know this better for its spinoffs like the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon and Chocobo Mystery Dungeon series'. So, if you’ve experienced either of those, you'll have a good idea of what to expect here. But if not, you can take the leap of faith when Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island launches exclusively for the Nintendo Switch on February 27, 2024.\n\nThe post Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon of Serpentcoil Island launches February 27, 2024 in the West appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Remember Gigantic? Gearbox Publishing certainly does. And it looks like the company is hoping fans of the doomed hero shooter do as well. The company sent emails to some former Gigantic players, inviting them to come together once more for a \"limited time throwback event.\" \n\n\nIt seems to have taken some folks by surprise. The humble Gigantic subreddit hummed back to life after players began sharing their invitations. The rise of excitement is somewhat heartwarming to see. It was only two months ago former players were asking: \"Does anyone else miss Gigantic?\" Well, for a short time, Gigantic will rise from the ashes once more.\n\n\n\"Play Gigantic once more on October 5 at 21:00 CEST - October 7 at 06:00 CEST,\" reads the email invite, \"and re-live the good old days of playing this beloved strategic hero shooter!\"\n\n\n\n\nIs the throwback event setting the stage for a Gigantic comeback?\n\n\nGigantic will be playable for a select chosen few starting tomorrow, according to the email. The event will last for only two days, and there are limitations. Beyond being \"invite only\" to those who received the email, the throwback event can't be streamed or recorded — according to an invitee. And this could be the reason: The game may not be the same as fans remember.\n\n\nAccording to some invitees, the game is going to come with a suite of updates. The email they received mentioned \"Revamped Content\" such as a Fortune Card System, a Progression System, loadouts, customization options for weapon skins, and more. The new version apparently includes a Rush Mode, a \"fast-paced and action packed\" mode for a \"simplified\" experience.\n\n\nDoes this mean Gearbox is testing the waters for a Gigantic return? Now might be a good time considering its most dangerous rival, Overwatch 2, has been having some struggles. \n\nThe post Hero shooter Gigantic is returning for a ‘throwback’ event appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "In Fortnite's goal to become \"multi-game ecosystem\" and a creative platform, Fortnite will soon require age rating for all first and third-party content. To make this happen, Epic has formed a partnership with the International Age Rating Coalition, or IARC. If you fashion yourself a creator on Fortnite, this new regulation takes effect starting on November 14.\n\n\n“When you are ready to publish your island to Fortnite, you will fill out the IARC content rating questionnaire before you submit your island to be published and reviewed by Epic moderators,” the Fortnite Team wrote in a blog post. \n\n\n“When the questionnaire is complete, you will receive an age-based IARC rating for the content of your island along with region-specific ratings from IARC-participating rating authorities. These ratings will automatically be applied and prominently displayed prior to access.”\n\n\nIt appears that the IARC will consult regional ratings boards such as the ESRB for North America, PEGI for Europe, ACB for Australia, USK for Germany, and others based on where the player is based. This solution seems to be one designed to protect both creators and audiences — especially younger audiences — to create and consume Fortnite experiences tailor-made for their comfortability level. \n\n\nWhile this regulation doesn’t go into full-effect until November 14, the abovementioned IARC questionnaire goes live on October 16. It's to ensure creators have enough time to rate their experiences before the cutoff deadline of — you guessed it — November 14. According to the blog post, any experience left unrated will be delisted on that date, so make sure to abide by the new rule. We’d hate to see the islands you spent so much time and hard work on go dark.\n\nThe post Fortnite is adding individual age ratings for all of its experiences appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Forthright Entertainment has announced that Soma Games’ The Lost Legends of Redwall: The Scout Anthology is prepped to re-release consoles on December 1, 2023. It’s coming to PS5, Xbox X|S, and PC.\n\n\nI kind of had to do some digging on this one since the press release omits certain things, like the fact that this is a compilation of three previously released games. The first episode of The Lost Legends of Redwall: The Scout dropped back in 2018, with the other two following in 2021. Only the first act landed on Xbox One and PS4, with the others arriving on PC. This point is moot, however, because they’ve been delisted from all platforms. Going forward, this is going to be the only way to experience them.\n\n\nI missed them the first time, which is funny because on my wishlist of games I want to see is a decent game based on Brian Jacques’ Redwall book series. In my youth, I was an avid fan of the series and read through a good chunk of them. If you’re unfamiliar, they’re essential fantasy novels, but instead of Elves and Orcs, it’s mice and rats. They’re joyful and well-written books, even if they tend to be pretty formulaic.\n\n\n\n\nSo far, it looks… okay. I don't think the games were exactly well-received the first time around, so hopefully, Soma Games did something with the feedback they received. I don’t think the trailer is doing it any favors. Usually, trailers are really heavily edited to show only the most polished slices of gameplay, and this one looks pretty raw. It’s a linear, action-adventure narrative told in three parts. I find it funny that it says, “An adventure for all the family,” directly after showing what looks like conflagrated rats. The books weren’t exactly flowery all the time, so it’s hard to have Redwall without the war.\n\n\nGosh, good times.\n\n\nThe Lost Legends of Redwall: The Scout Anthology is coming to PS5, Xbox X|S, and PC on December 1, 2023.\n\nThe post Rodent adventure The Lost Legends of Redwall: The Scout Anthology is releasing December 1 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A port for Rockstar's famous Red Dead Redemption moseyed onto the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 (but compatible on PS5) in early August. Sadly, the celebratory hoedown came to an abrupt halt when players learned the game would go for $49.99 and run at 30 FPS. And while that don't beat all, Rockstar has at least fixed half the issue. The port of Red Dead Redemption got an update that silently added support for 60 FPS, so long as you're saddled up with the PS5. I will slow my Western puns for now.\n\n\nRockstar released update 1.03 on October 3 and made nary a fuss about the framerate change. The Red Dead Redemption port now has a framerate toggle within its Display menu, allowing PS5 owners to run it at the accepted standard of 60 FPS. Here is the full patch notes for 1.03 via Rockstar Games:\n\n\n\nAdded an option to enable 60 FPS when played on PlayStation 5 via backward compatibility\n\n\nAdded an option to enable subtitles upon first booting the game\n\n\nGeneral bug fixes and improvements\n\n\n\n\n\nRedemption partially arrives for PS5 owners\n\n\nFans weren't thrilled with the news of the port to say the very least. While its performance on the aging Switch is arguable, it should be easily capable of running at a higher framerate on Sony's more powerful machines. The game got a 4K patch and a framerate boost when it went backward compatible on the Xbox One X system in 2018, after all. Fans also weren't enthused by its hefty price tag, despite Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick calling it \"commercially accurate.\" \n\n\nRed Dead Redemption is available for download on the Switch and PlayStation 4 for $49.99. It comes with the base game along with the Undead Nightmares DLC. \n\nThe post Red Dead Redemption port adds 60 FPS for PS5 appeared first on Destructoid.",

We also got confirmation the beta would eventually make its way to PC and Xbox. Now we have the exact dates and times the multiplayer beta for Modern Warfare 3 will be available.\n\n\nMinutes to midnight\n\n\nIf you pre-ordered Modern Warfare 3 on PS4 or PS5, as stated above, you’ll be among the first invited to jump into the multiplayer beta. It should be unlocked for you from October 6 (Friday) at 10 a.m. PST / 1 p.m. EST until October 8 (Sunday) at 10 a.m. PST / 1 p.m. EST. \n\n\nFor those PlayStation fans who didn’t pre-order Modern Warfare 3, you’re up next — you can play the beta from October 8 (Sunday) at 10 a.m. PST / 1 p.m. EST until October 10 (Tuesday) at 10 a.m. PST / 1 p.m. EST. \n\n\nOK — now it’s time for everyone else (kind of). If you pre-ordered the game on PC or Xbox, it’s your turn to take a spin from October 12 (Thursday) at 10 a.m. PST / 1 p.m. EST until October 14 (Saturday) at 10 a.m. PST / 1 p.m. EST. It’s important to note that PlayStation players can also partake during this time.\n\n\nAnd lastly, we have a period where the beta will truly be accessible to anyone and everyone, regardless of if you pre-ordered Modern Warfare 3 or not. If this sounds like you, give the multiplayer beta a shot from October 14 (Saturday) at 10 a.m. PST / 1 p.m. EST until October 16 (Monday) at 10 a.m. PST / 1 p.m. EST. \n\n\nWe hope that helps you to make the most of this — admittedly short-lived — beta.

As French publication Libération reports, three of the arrests were made yesterday, and two were made today. \n\n\nIt is not known yet whether the arrested individuals have been charged, and if so for what. However, it is reported that the arrests come following an investigation of complaints by the Solidaires Informatique union and two victims. According to one of the plaintiff's lawyers, Maude Beckers, the case encompasses more than individual behavior and also concerns \"systemic sexual violence.\"\n\n\nThus far, only two arrested individuals have been named. The first is former Ubisoft chief creative officer Serge Hascoët, and the other is former editorial vice president Tommy François. Both individuals left Ubisoft in 2020.\n\n\nOver the years, reports emerged painting a pattern of sexual harassment at Ubisoft. When these allegations began making headlines, Ubisoft claimed it would launch an investigation and take the appropriate disciplinary actions. Since then, many higher-ups have stepped down or been terminated from the company, including those former execs and others. The allegations were enough to also trigger a legal investigation.\n\n\nIn a statement to GamesIndustry.biz, Ubisoft said: \"\"Ubisoft has no knowledge of what has been shared and therefore can't comment.\"\n\nThe post Former Ubisoft execs arrested following sexual harassment investigation appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Fallout: London – the upcoming mod for Fallout 4 – is one of the most ambitious fan-made projects we've seen in some time. Now, as development continues, the team has shared a new update video, which outlines what else is coming.\n\n\nThe progress video on YouTube opens with voice actress Letitia \"LetitiaTHELemon\" Lemon saying that it's getting harder to conceal spoilers as \"things start working towards wrapping up.\" We also get a glimpse of a ruined version of Bromley, a large town within Greater London.\n\n\n\n\nThere's some other sneak peeks as well, including some dangerous apex predators that stalk the streets, as well as a gang that's been inspired by Peaky Blinders.\n\n\nAre they suggesting London isn't safe?\n\n\nThe mythical creatures that prey on wanders are called Dryads (I think I'm spelling that correctly) and have a slight appearance of the Spriggan from The Elder Scrolls games. \n\n\nAs for the Vagabonds, this is a new gang that's been added into the Fallout mod that rules Bromley, with a look about them that's been lifted from the hit TV show starring Cillian Murphy. They inhabit the Swan and Mitre, a dilapidated pub that's been modelled after the real one.\n\n\nAll these teases for Fallout: London have been whetting the appetite of fans who've been keen to play the mod in its final form. However, there's still no confirmed release date as of yet, but it sounds like we're getting close to one. We know it's aiming to launch in 2023, so we could see it arriving within the next couple of months. But that's only speculation at this stage.\n\n\nYou can read more about what this Fallout 4 project is actually about on the website. The team is always looking for volunteers to help with the project.\n\nThe post Fallout: London video introduces Peaky Blinders-inspired gang appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Us fans of classic first-person shooters were delighted when the Quake 2 remaster launched recently. A little bit of nostalgia with a dollop of newness to give the iconic game a fresh coat of paint. Now, we're in for another treat with a mod that makes id Software's 1997 release more violent and harrowing.\n\n\nAs spotted by DSO Gaming, modder SGtMarkIV recently released a \"quick gameplay test\" of something they're calling \"Brutal Quake 2.\" As the name suggests, this is a mod that ups the violence in Q2, but also tweaks the game in general by adding new ideas.\n\n\n\n\nThe footage shows the current work-in-progress. We see that it has the look of Quake 2, only with...well...more brutality. Interestingly enough, we also get to see a map not in the original release or remaster. This one puts the player and other marines in a battlefield, fighting Stroggs as chaos ensues and explosions litter a kind of no man's land. Imagine if Johns Romero and Carmack did a Medal of Honor game back in 1997.\n\n\nAlso, it's not made in the Quake engine\n\n\nOne thing to note about this footage is that it doesn't quite look like a modified version of Q2. Sure, the opening map bears a resemblance to the Outer Base level, but it looks different somehow.\n\n\nThis is because SGtMarkIV is having to make it in GZDoom, the modern toolkit/engine that's used to mod the original Doom games. They say that GZDoom can read the models from Quake 2's files, which means this mod can run in the Doom engine, but with Quake assets.\n\n\nWe don't know the release date for Brutal Quake 2 yet, but given that it's coming from the mind that brought us Brutal Doom, expect carnage a-plenty.\n\nThe post Upcoming ‘Brutal Quake 2’ mod shows the horrors of war appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "To paraphrase George Orwell: \"If you want a picture of the future, imagine a community of gamers modifying Skyrim... forever.\" Bethesda's epic RPG has been modded to death, but none hit quite the same as this one that allows NPCs to break wind.\n\n\nNexus Mods user JobiWanUK (thanks, PC Gamer—no really... thank you) brings flatulence to the fantasy world of Tamriel. Not only does this mod give a new voice to the denizens of Skyrim (or at least their asses), it also implements realistic reactions for that added dose of fart-y immersion.\n\n\n\n\nWe're also treated to a full eight and half minute video showcasing what happens when an NPC lets one rip in Skyrim. We get everything from laughter to disgust to angry requests that one leave the vicinity. One guard even offers their fart to the player as a kind of windy gift.\n\n\nIt's a lot more in-depth than you might think\n\n\nIt's not just adult NPCs and guards, either. Children can also let loose their own pint-sized butt guffaws. As can dogs, horses, and even goats.\n\n\nThe mod description and video say that there are different farts for different occasions. For example, there are ones for when someone is sat down or when they're asleep. There are even silent farts, for god's sake!\n\n\nYou can also customize how often you get to experience NPCs cutting the cheese. It might be you want to be amused every hour or you don't mind if it's just once a day. You can even disable the sleep farts or the ones emitted by animals.\n\n\nFor all its faults and bugs, Skyrim definitely continues to be a breath of fresh air thanks to the modding community. Actually, perhaps \"breath of fresh air\" is not an appropriate term to use in this context.\n\nThe post Skyrim NPCs can now fart, our lives are complete appeared first on Destructoid.",

The games I got with it – games like Total Recall and Kid Icarus – had me convinced that I just hated games on the NES. It wasn’t until I was introduced to a couple of games on this list, that retro gaming truly opened up to me.\n\n\nI do believe that games age, but mostly on a technical level. Poor framerates and blurry graphics can make it difficult to return to an early 3D game. Their design, on the other hand, is rarely completely superseded.

          "description": "It's a tradition that as hardware ages, companies will stop supporting it with new releases, and eventually online services shut down. It has been a slow death for the 3DS and the Wii U which had their eShops shut down this year. The next step in phasing out these devices will come in April 2024 when Nintendo shuts down online services for software on the platforms. \n\n\nIn short, this means that online play and anything else that requires the internet will no longer be available for the 3DS and Wii U. Nintendo has clarified that a more specific date for the shutdown will be revealed later. \n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nWhat happens after online services are shut down for 3DS and Wii U? \n\n\nLet's start with what won't be getting axed. The shutdown of online services on the 3DS and Wii U won't stop you from playing single-player offline games. You won't lose your library either because \"it will still be possible to download update data and redownload purchased software and downloadable content from Nintendo eShop.\"\n\n\n\n\nStreetPass will still be fully functional, as that relies on local communication, though you will lose SpotPass. You'll also be losing the following:  \n\n\n\nonline co-operative play\n\n\ninternet rankings\n\n\ndata distribution\n\n\n\nPokemon players can breathe a sigh of relief, as Pokemon Bank will still have access to online services, though \"that may also end at some point in the future.\" \n\n\nThe shutdown of online services is unfortunate but unavoidable too. It does seem that Nintendo is freeing up resources as it looks to its future which, if reports are to be believed, may feature a Switch successor as soon as next year.\n\nThe post Nintendo shutting down online services for 3DS and Wii U software in April 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, whatever criticism people have, it hasn't stopped Bethesda's new release from being nominated for several awards.\n\n\nOver on GamesRadar, voting for the Golden Joystick Award 2023 has begun. Here, you'll get a chance to decide which games of this year (and before) were your favorite. Categories include Best Storytelling, Studio of the Year, Best Indie Game, Still Playing Award, and more.\n\n\n\n\nOf course, being one of the most hyped games of this generation, Starfield has a number of recognitions. For this year's GJA, the sci-fi RPG has been nominated for Best Audio, Best Visual Design, and Xbox Game of the Year.\n\n\nNote: not 'Game of the Year' overall\n\n\nNobody will be surprised that Starfield is being recognized in the industry. However, it's interesting to note that it isn't under the PC Game of the Year category. This could be because it's an Xbox exclusive, but it did release on PC as well.\n\n\nAs for it being the best Xbox game, it's going up against the likes of the Bethesda-published Hi-Fi Rush, the remake of Dead Space, and Obsidian's text-heavy medieval release Pentiment (which I voted for because I'm pretentious like that).\n\n\nStarfield itself has been received pretty favorably, with it currently showing a pretty solid Metacritic score of 86 and 84 on PC and Xbox, respectively. However, as time marches on, people are beginning to see the cracks, so maybe it won't have the legacy Skyrim retains to this day.\n\nThe post Starfield nominated for Xbox Game of the Year at Golden Joystick Awards appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Assassin's Creed franchise has been on quite a roller coaster since the original was released over 15 years ago. At first, each successive title seemed to enhance the core mechanics of the stealthy gameplay you'd expect from a game with the word \"assassin\" in the title. But then Assassin's Creed Origins changed up the formula a bit. Assassin's Creed became an open-world game, with more similarities to Far Cry than the original Assassin's Creed games. The next two entries in the franchise, Odyssey and Valhalla, built upon that formula. With Valhalla, it felt like the combat had finally reached its peak, but something was lost along the way. It no longer felt like Assassin's Creed. In fact, Valhalla often discouraged you from taking the stealth route.\n\n\n Mirage seeks to return the series…",

In a reply to this tweet, he clarifies this round is “significantly smaller than the first,” referring to an earlier round of layoffs this past March that affected 9,000 Amazon employees, over 400 of which were roles at Twitch, according to a report by GamesIndustry.biz. It’s an inopportune time for not only those affected, but also for Twitch, which will be hosting its semi-annual TwitchCon at the end of the month.\n\n\nAccording to GamesIndustry.biz, an unnamed source said these layoffs were mostly affecting “the customer experience organization,” and were a result of the company shifting towards an outsourcing business model to fulfill these roles.\n\n\n\"Given the uncertain economy in which we reside, and the uncertainty that exists in the near future, we have chosen to be more streamlined in our costs and headcount,\" said Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, in response to the first round of layoffs in March.

But if you're looking for something a little…older, this fan-made commercial should do the trick.\n\n\nStraight from the mind of the YouTube channel Luiz do Comercial, this video is a blast from the past. Aimed at recreating the somber yet powerful aesthetic of 1988, the clip reimagines the modern Super Mario Wonder as a classic NES game. In case you're wondering, yes, they do the \"Now You're Playing with Power\" slogan at the end.\n\n\nIn a fascinating turn, the creator notes that the inspiration came from an unlikely place: a retro remake concept of Mario Wonder by Nimaginendo Games. It also draws upon elements of Mario 2, including the in-game visuals. As Luiz notes: \"This was a very audacious project, because in addition to the 3D and 2D, I had to do all the pixel art for the supposed NES game!\"\n\n\n\n\nThese bits of nostalgia really work on me\n\n\nGiven that I was around for the height of the NES' success in America, these types of fan-made projects speak to me in a big way. This one, in particular, is really spot on, from the hazy '80s/'90s viewing experience to the booming horror-like voiceover effect.\n\n\nIt brings me back to a time when we were constantly advertised to by a faceless void-like entity; before the attitude-ridden '90s came along and changed things considerably. By then, people were on-screen screaming in our faces. Game marketing is a fascinating microcosm of weirdness!\n\n\n[Thanks Rob!]\n\nThe post This fan-made retro-fied Mario Wonder commercial is lovely appeared first on Destructoid.",

From the expected bug fixes to methods for altering the protagonist's appearance, there's plenty to like. \n\n\nOne less popular addition was giving the Sphynx His Majesty a regretful coat of fur. Until the patch, this rude and pompous cat had an illustrious mane of nothing, adding to his charm, and thankfully the latest hotfix restores this. \n\n\nAmong the first changes noted on the hotfix's page was Larian Studio's wise decision to shave His Majesty. If anything, this hotfix primarily reverses controversial changes made in Patch 3 that fans haven't taken to. \n\n\nA cat who is not His Majesty also saw changes. Another Sphynx named Steelclaw had her eye color adjusted to not be His Majesty's clone.\n\n\nAnother reversal made was with how inventory management occurred. Patch 3 introduced a shared inventory system where party members shared items they deemed important with the player upon dismissal. It proved to be a bit of a headache for players, so Larian reverted the change.\n\n\nNot every change made is a reversal back to the Patch 2 settings. Alongside those are the general bug fixes that help generally improve the game's stability. \n\n\nAmong these are fixing several multiplayer-related crashes, namely when listening to dialogue after a roll and when reassigning characters in splitscreen. Other bugs fixed include preventing invalid saves from being created and Twitch drops not being claimable on PS5. \n\n\nIf there is anything to take away from this hotfix, it's that Larian Studios knows when to back down from a disliked change.

          "description": "If a new patch adds in a bug, no matter how small, the Pokemon community will find it. This one is a tad bigger than a mere annoyance though, as Pokemon Scarlet & Violet version 2.0.1 (which arrived for the Teal Mask DLC) apparently added in a hardware crash.\n\n\nSo here's how it happens:\n\n\n\nGet to the final battle of the game\n\n\nHave Miraidon or Koraidon (the box cover legendaries) in your Pokedex\n\n\nSelect Pokemon party slots 4-6\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see in the above video from Twitter user Mattyoukhana_, the bug triggers as soon as you highlight the fourth or sixth party slot. You can move around slots 1-3 all you want, and even swing around the top to the bottom-most entry of your chosen box Pokemon. But once you hit the slot above it, boom, crash.\n\n\nAs the community points out in the ensuing discussion, you can sidestep the bug by not hovering over the aforementioned slots, or by just not having a full party. For those of you who steamroll battles with just one 'Mon, you probably won't even notice it.\n\n\nFolks are flabbergasted as to how this can happen, as this was evidently added to the base campaign, and didn't happen in the new DLC zone. But it wouldn't be a Pokemon game without some puzzling bugs. Ideally, this bug will be spread far and wide, and Game Freak will be able to patch it out at some point. I refrained from typing \"swiftly patch out,\" because this is Game Freak we're talking about. We're still months on from the launch of the game, and a lot of performance issues are still lingering.\n\nThe post The most recent Pokemon Scarlet & Violet patch adds a new way to crash the game appeared first on Destructoid.",

These maps include: Afghan, Derail, Estate, Favela, Karachi, Highrise, Invasion, Quarry, Rundown, Rust, Scrapyard, Skidrow, Sub Base, Terminal, Underpass, and Wasteland. \n\n\nAccording to the official reveal of Modern Warfare III, all of these maps will be available at launch, though it's unclear if that means they'll all be available in the beta. \n\n\nIt should be noted that, while the multiplayer beta launches this Friday, that’s only for PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5 players who have the game pre-ordered. The open beta will begin on October 8, and has been confirmed to arrive on other platforms, but word has been scarce on the timing of that release. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III arrives on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series, and PC on November 10, 2023.\n\n\nAdditionally, the Call of Duty: NEXT event, as well as the Call of Duty Endowment Bowl IV will both take place on Thursday, October 5 starting at 9:00 a.m. PST/11:00 a.m. EST. Those interested in tuning in can do so via the official Call of Duty Twitch or YouTube channels.\n\nThe post Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III gets multiplayer trailer just ahead of beta launch appeared first on Destructoid.",

On the social media website that I insist on calling Twitter, Square Enix posted the following clarification:\n\n\n\n“In Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Cait Sith is pronounced ‘Kate Sihth.’”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor some Final Fantasy fans, this statement may read along the lines of calling water wet. In fact, I imagine many who played Final Fantasy 7 back in 1997 naturally pronounced the name like that. However, many (naturally) believe the name “Cait Sith” to be a reference to the corresponding Celtic folklore creature “Cait Sidhe.” This is typically pronounced like “Ket-Shee,” which some have since applied to the remote-controlled Shinra machination.

The developer FuturLab revealed a new trailer for the virtual reality spray-fest today. \n\n\nYou'll be able to explore the town of Muckingham like never before with a 360-degree view of the washing action. If you pre-order this experience, you'll get the Cat-Proof gloves as an in-game item.\n\n\n\n\nPower washing in VR sounds like a relaxing task\n\n\nThroughout the town of Muckingham, you'll be able to clean a skate park, play golf with your spray gun, and wash cars in a garage. You can even clean up the mayor's house. How fancy. \n\n\nThe co-op VR experience may be a bit odd, however. The PowerWash Simulator VR release date trailer shows each team member as a floating head with two hands. It might be strange for those who want to see the bodies of each person in your squad. \n\n\nWhat makes VR so entertaining, on the other hand, is the physical interactivity behind your movements in-game. I don’t know about you, but that pulls me into a VR game so much. According to the game’s official Meta listing, we’ll “reach up, get down and lean-in to tackle those pesky hard-to-reach spots.”\n\n\nYou can also play this game from your chair if you don't want to bend down.\n\n\nScreenshot via Meta Quest's YouTube channel\n\n\nThe Meta Quest 3 arrives just before this\n\n\nThe Meta Quest 3 will be arriving on October 10. It has double the graphical processing power and has a 4K+ Infinite Display. The cheapest model has 128GB and costs $499.99, while the 512GB model is $649.99. Hopefully, PowerWash Simulator VR only sinks a small amount of GB of that storage. \n\n\nThankfully, PowerWash Simulator VR will support the Meta Quest 2 as well.

It called it a sci-fi adventure where one man is trying to survive, and hopefully get home, after a space mission goes wrong. To do so, he must rely on both himself and various copies of himself. \nToday, 11 Bit Studios released a new trailer of The Alters that gives us our first look at its gameplay, which highlights that it's a third-person, base-building survival game. The team says the story is \"driven by life-defining choices and exploring the diverse paths one could take\" after Jan crash-lands on an inhospitable planet turning toward a massive sun. \nCheck it out for yourself in The Alters gameplay trailer below: \n\n\n\"In this desperate race against time, Jan must harness local Rapidium crystals to create his many versions: the 'Alters',\" a press release reads. \"Set within an ever-moving mobile base, both teamwork and building a wide range of expertise are indispensable for survival. By selecting diverging paths for other Jans during the alteration process, they acquire distinct skill sets. They become invaluable, not only for maintaining the base, but also for tasks like cooking, crafting tools for surface exploration, and gathering essential resources.\" \n11 Bit Studios says the Alters are more than mere resources, though, as they are sentient beings with their own emotions, problems, goals, and sometimes, existential doubts about their purpose. \n\"Despite their differences, their collective goal is to escape, echoing Jan's determination to survive: I'll just do it all by myselves,\" the press release reads.\n\nThe Alters is due out on current-gen consoles and PC sometime in 2024. \nFor more, watch The Alters' reveal trailer here, and then read Game Informer's reviews of 11 Bit Studios' other games: This War of Mine, Frostpunk, and Children of Morta. \nAre you going to check out The Alters next year?

Now, Nintendo has announced that online play and other device functionality that requires online communication is coming to an end, too. \nMore specifically, Nintendo says online services for these devices will end in April 2024. \nAs of early April 2024, online play and other functionality that uses online communication will end service for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U software. Thank you very much for your continued support of our products.\nhttps://t.co/nOyzBImHCE\nOctober 4, 2023\n\"In early April 2024, online play and other functionality that uses online communication will end for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U software,\" Nintendo's announcement reads. \"This also includes cooperative play, internet rankings, and data distribution.\"\nNintendo says it will announce a specific end date and time at a later date and that it reserves the right to discontinue these online services earlier if \"an event occurs that would make it difficult to continue online services\" for the 3DS and Wii U. It also notes this includes software exclusive to the New Nintendo 3DS. \nThe company then answers a number of questions in an FAQ section of the announcement. It notes that Pokemon Bank will still be usable following April 2024 and that \"for the foreseeable future, it will still be possible to download update data and redownload purchased software and downloadable content from Nintendo eShop.\" \nThe fan-favorite 3DS feature, StreetPass, will fortunately still work as it uses local communication between devices, but SpotPass, which uses online communication instead, will no longer be available after April 2024. \nFor more, read Game Informer's farewell to the Nintendo Wii U eShop. \nWhat's your favorite online memory of the Wii U or 3DS?

Now, Game Informer can exclusively reveal it hits PlayStation 5 on October 31, making this a great spooky experience for the holiday. \nFor the uninitiated, The Forest Cathedral is inspired by events surrounding real-life scientist Rachel Carson's investigation into Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, otherwise known as the harmful DDT pesticide. Publisher Whitethorn Games says this game is \"a dramatic reimagining of Carson's environmental science book, Silent Spring.\" \nYou can get a look at it in The Forest Cathedral PS5 release date trailer below: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, in The Forest Cathedral, players take on the role of Rachel in her new field research biologist position on a mysterious island. What begins as simply completing weekly work tasks becomes something more horrific when Rachel learns about what DDT is doing to the area. Whitethorn says players \"will slowly uncover the horrific effects of the pesticide using advanced environment technology to complete puzzles that weave together 3D exploration with 2D platforming.\" \n\nAs far as gameplay goes, players switch between Rachel Carson in a 3D world and the \"Little Man\" inside the 2D world of Rachel's scanning tools. It's in this 2D world where players will solve puzzles and complete platforming challenges.\nThe Forest Cathedral is available right now on Xbox Series X/S and PC via Steam. It hits PS5 on Halloween. \nAre you interested in checking out The Forest Cathedral? Let us know in the comments below!",

If this trailer is any indication, Venom is quite the formidable foe for these two. \nCheck it out for yourself in the Marvel's Spider-Man 2 trailer below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 continues to look great, and fortunately, we don't have to wait long to get our hands on it because it hits PS5 on October 20. \nIn the meantime, read about how Marvel's Spider-Man 2 features more than 65 suits and then read our thoughts on the game after going hands-on with it. Check out Game Informer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 New Gameplay Today after that. \nIs Marvel's Spider-Man 2 a day-one purchase for you? Let us know in the comments below!",

Eurogamer also reports the news was delivered to employees during an emergency town hall meeting this morning.\nIn addition to members of the QA team, Team17 CEO Michael Pattison will also be stepping down, according to a statement received by VG247. This stands in sharp contrast to many other recent layoffs, where executives had been exempt from cost-cutting measures. You can read the full statement below.\nFor more on the recent wave of layoffs, read about how Sega canceled several upcoming games and how Epic laid off over 800 people.\n[Source: Eurogamer, VG247]\nWhat do you think about this year's massive amount of layoffs?",

Between its visuals, throwback gameplay, nautical tunes, and modern reimaginings of old-school adventure gameplay, it caught my attention. And now it's finally out!\nI spoke to developer Webbysoft, who is mostly just one person based in Australia, about Bilkins' Folly ahead of the game's release over email.

Join us today on Twitch at 2:00 p.m. Central as we take a bloody journey through the game's genre-defining story campaign. Episodes will be uploaded to our Game Informer Shows YouTube channel the following Saturday morning. \nAfter 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon seemingly concluded the franchise's main narrative, 2011's entry picked up the bloody pieces. It moved the saga forward by resetting the timeline, serving as a soft reboot that brought Mortal Kombat back to its 2D fighting roots and ushering in the return of the classic roster. MK 9's cinematic story mode served as an epiphany for the series and fighting games as a whole, establishing the blueprint for narrative fighting campaigns still utilized today. MK9's story also serves as the first chapter of the modern trilogy of games that Mortal Kombat 1 builds upon. For a whole lot more on MK9 and its development, you can read this feature on how the reboot saved the franchise.\nJoin editors Marcus Stewart and Kyle Hilliard as they battle their way through MK 9 to see how its reimagined tournament holds up. \nPart 1 - Surpr-iced! \nPart 2 - Bringing The Smoke\nPart 3 - Staff Meeting\nPart 4 - My Life As A Lin Kuei Robot\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

The company cites \"lower profitability of the European region.\" \nAs a result of the lower profitability, Sega reviewed various in-development projects from its developers in Europe and the result is the cancelation of Hyenas, which just finished up a closed beta on PC less than a week ago, and some other unannounced games. Eurogamer reports that layoffs at Creative Assembly are expected in the wake of this decision. \n\n\n\"We will implement reduction of various fixed expenses at several group companies in relevant region, centered on the Creative Assembly Ltd.,\" a Sega press release reads. \"We expect to incur one-time expenses related to reduction of fixed expenses. We will continue to consider measures to improve profitability in European bases apart from above. We will announce the specific details and impact from them as soon as we make a decision.\" \nSega says as a result of this structural reform, it expects to record losses of approximately 14.3 billion yen for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, but that \"there are no changes to the full-year consolidated operating results forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, at this time.\" \nSega revealed Hyenas as a first-person multiplayer, multi-team heist shooter experience set in space with a punky comic book aesthetic in 2022.

Shortly after, Netflix revealed that Hayley Atwell, whom you might recognize as Grace from this year's Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning or as Peggy Carter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, would voice Lara Croft in the series. Today, Netflix released our first look at the series, which is called Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft. \nThere's no word on when to expect the series, but Netflix says it's coming to the subscription streaming service soon. \nCheck out the Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft teaser trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see in the teaser above, this take on Lara Croft seemingly follows the recent Crystal Dynamics Tomb Raider reboot trilogy that concluded with 2018's Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Back in 2021, when Netflix announced Atwell's role in the show, it confirmed the series would take place after the events of that trilogy. Looking at this teaser, it's hard to say whether or not that's the case. But it sounds like we won't have to wait long to find out since Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft is expected to hit Netflix soon. \nIn the meantime, check out the teaser trailer for Netflix's Devil May Cry anime series released today as well.

          "description": "The day has come. We are super happy to announce public beta testing for the iOS port of ScummVM in the store. Yes, you read it right! Since Lars Sundström, aka lman, joined our team as the iOS porter, we have made significant progress. Thus, you no longer need to compile ScummVM yourself in order to add it to your iOS or iPadOS device. \nIf you want to help by testing this version, just follow this Testflight link and enroll yourself in the test program. This may require installing Apple’s Testflight app. You can find instructions on how to install games and how to play them on our documentation portal.\nWe truly appreciate your feedback. You can share your thoughts with the Testflight feedback feature, where you can attach screenshots and post detailed descriptions. Alternatively, you can use our bugtracker, e-mail us at ios@scummvm.org, or post on our Discord Server. Your help will let us eventually add ScummVM to the App Store.\n>",
