Just a bit of topical humour there. Sorry, we'll never do it again. Look, the point is, République — the game whose Nintendo Life review you are currently reading — is about escaping from such a dystopia.\nBack in the day République was a phone game, the trappings of which made perfect sense for its type of input. You took control of a rogue element of indeterminate nature who essentially closes the gap between player and controller; a little like the excellent In Other Waters; here, you're in control of the various cameras, computers and other systems in the enormous complex where the female lead character finds herself captured. You're helping this girl escape, not escaping yourself. It made you feel just the right amount of helpless, just the right lack of agency. You had a lot of power, but you were still ultimately just an observer. It, dare we say it, made it easier to care, easier to get invested in this character when she had autonomy outside of your own personal whims.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It might have been coded using cut up letters from magazines.

Buying old games and rereleasing them seems to be most of Piko's wheelhouse, as they've bought a bunch of old IPs and stuck the games onto digital storefronts. Piko Interactive were, for example, behind the Steam releases of Super 3D Noah's Ark, First Samurai, and something called Bubble Ghost which sounds cuter than it probably is. Piko's previous releases typically also include the original file for the game, so hopefully Glover purists will also be satisfied by this version.

It involves installing a beta version of Microsoft Edge (less great!) and, by way of a Game Pass Ultimate subscription, streaming those games to the Deck in a browser. Not running Game Pass games locally, in other words, but running them well enough to be playable, and with seamless compatibility for the Steam Deck’s controls.\r\n\n\r\nAfter having gone through the lengthy setup process (explained below, if you want to try streaming Game Pass games on the Steam Deck yourself) and playing for a while, I can say it’s a good enough start in bringing Microsoft’s library to Valve’s handheld. Between this and the Epic Games Launcher, it’s a relief that the Deck’s default SteamOS won’t be limited to Steam games after all.

For whatever reason, the other two films never got their own games - I just assumed that was because nobody liked the films that much. The truth is, developers TT Games have been working on them all along, albeit as part of Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, a mega-game including all nine mainline films in the franchise. \nIt's been in development for a while, and has been delayed several times, allegedly resulting in extensive crunch. It's finally coming out on April 5th, but having played about an hour of Episode IV, this is not the Lego Star Wars-ing I remember. The plots are the same, of course, but much of its mindless minifig bashing has now been swapped for... over-the-shoulder third-person shooting?

One sidequest in Tango’s open world spook-busting adventure sees a neighbourhood disturbed by piano music, eerily plonking away at ungodly hours. Roaming the streets you soon catch the haunting strains of Moonlight Sonata, a piece famously played in Mikami’s Resident Evil to unlock a secret passage. But it’s more than a cute nod. Ghostwire’s credits reveal the player to be Mikami himself - showing off talents usually reserved for fellow Bethesda creators behind closed doors. \nWhile I’m sure he contributed more than tinkling mood music for an optional quest, Ghostwire has been framed as a debutante ball for the next generation of Tango talent. In Archipel’s ace interview series Mikami spoke about fostering new creative leads and taking more of a backseat compared to his work on The Evil Within, which was more clearly made in the Resi mold. The result is, by design, the studio’s least Mikami-ish romp to date: a sprawling tale of a metropolis turned ghost town that is one part love letter to the city and its urban legends, and an opportunity to zap headless school girls and floating puppets with electrifying particle effects.\nRead more",

I knew straight away what would be first up on my video game playlist: FAR: Changing Tides, the sequel to Okomotive's beautifully melancholy roadtrip adventure, FAR: Lone Sails. While Changing Tides tells a separate story to its predecessor, putting you in the shoes of a new protagonist and swapping its desolate wastelands for a watery seascape, the hot, beating core powering the game remains very much the same. With nothing left for you at home in the wake of an unknown disaster, it's time to pack up and head on out for a new beginning, with only your hulking great boat/steamtrain contraption for company. \nIf you still haven't played FAR: Changing Tides, I'd urge you to stop reading now and come back later. There are big spoilers about the game's ending coming up in this article, and I really don't want to ruin that for you. So, fair warning, okay? If you're still here I'm assuming you've played and finished Changing Tides, because holy moly, isn't it just the most perfect thing?\nRead more",

Right from the start of its anime goth girl intro I knew this wasn't really my kind of thing, and yet its striking art and sense of sincerity felt compelling. \nAnd it was a bit weird, which is sometimes enough. It depicts a frankenstein cast out by villagers, left to wander the wilderness, across forests and mountains, still peppered with arrows, turning up at a sinister tower that seems to welcome them. And just a few minutes in, it reveals itself as a mystery puzzle game with bullet hell parts. Almost none of this is my thing at all, but here I am playing it. Hmm.\nRead more",

Let's embrace Chaos.\nStranger Of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin is a Soulslike Final Fantasy spin-off that swings so much it misses. Your sole focus is to kill a bad guy called Chaos and the game provides fights and loot in their hundreds, possibly thousands, to ensure you're beefy enough when the time comes. But cut away the combat and you're left with little, really. Search for anything other than Chaos and you'll find there's nothing else driving you forwards.

I was fine by myself, like any good romcom protagonist at the start of the movie.\nAs I walked into the final boss arena, I had unwaivering confidence. I strolled in, staff at the ready and prepared to win. Then, my string of easy victories came to a shocking end. I got walloped and decimated for about 10 hours and eventually announced my defeat. Elden Ring was a game I just couldn’t finish. Fortunately, love had other plans, and I entered into a whirlwind romance with the Mimic Tear Ash.\nRead more",

Big performance improvements in exchange for only a minor drop in visual quality, if any at all? Yes please and thank you. Nvidia’s DLSS has established itself as the gold standard of upscalers, outperforming AMD’s FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR), but the Radeon makers are now readying two new offerings: FSR 2.0 and Radeon Super Resolution (RSR).\r\n\n\r\nFSR 2.0 looks to be a straight upgrade on the current 1.0 version, promising sharper picture quality with “optimised anti-aliasing” to better compete with the built-in, AI-assisted edge smoothing of DLSS. It will still need to be implemented in games by their developers, though – unlike RSR, which aims to work with just about any game by applying its upscaling algorithm at the GPU driver level.\r\n\n \nRead more",

This is a wonderful thing for me because their previous outing and namesake, Eastshade, is not only one of my favourite games of all time, but also such an important kind of game in the terrifying, nightmare world we find ourselves in today.\nYou see, Eastshade does one thing very, very well. In fact, it does it so well that most players probably won’t even have noticed until they look back and really think on it. Eastshade teaches mindfulness, a keen and acute awareness of oneself and one’s surroundings in the present moment. And that, my friends, is where the appeal comes from.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "In a move befitting a game about immortal beings who live out countless repeating lives on artificial islands powered by human sacrifice, Paradise Killer is getting a re-release. Sort of. It's coming to next-gen consoles today, with all platforms (including PC) getting some extra bits added for free that weren't in the original 2020 release. Not bad for a game that Kaizen Game Works creative director Oli Clarke Smith thought would only really sell to \"a niche of freaks\". If you're not one of those freaks, I'd heartily recommend becoming one. Playing Paradise Killer is like going to a seaside cosplay party where police procedurals play on loop and cocktails are snorted in a dehydrated powder form. It is a meticulously authored murder mystery with a cast of freaks.\nWhen I sat down to talk to both Clarke Smith and technical director Phil Crabtree about Paradise Killer's new update, it turns out that niche has already become quite large. Even Crabtree's dad has played Paradise Killer, though Crabtree isn't sure he really understood it. Crabtree also tells us he sometimes get messages from friends saying someone they know just played Paradise Killer and was talking about it. \"It just seems so weird that that there is this audience there that we never expected, and it doesn't seem that far away,\" he says. \"Like, it's not this mystery group of people, there always seems to be some connection that's quite close to you.\"\nRead more",

The sheer speed of the first game made it pretty popular among race-heads, but a bit of a daunting prospect for those used to a traditional “wheels on the ground” racing experience.\nRedout 2 doubles down on the speed element, that's for sure. But there's definitely an added air of approachability to this anti-grav racer, making the transition from Geforce to g-force a little less bruising than before. AI presets, added customisation, and more generous modes help make this a racing game you should keep up with.\nRead more",

          "description": "You may not have heard much about developer Complex Games, but the Canadian studio has a surprisingly storied history. Despite spending the last two decades building mobile and browser games for the likes of Disney, Nickelodeon and Zynga, their heart has always resided with the PC. \"There wasn't a lot of game development in Winnipeg, so we tried to figure it out ourselves and spent a few years trying to build a PC game,\" says creative director Noah Decter-Jackson. Fresh out of college, Complex's first project was a third-person hand-to-hand action prototype that they pitched to publishers at E3 2003, an endeavour that Decter-Jackson describes as \"phenomenally unsuccessful\".\nThis led to Complex remodelling as a work-for-hire outfit, and their long track-record making mobile games. But in 2015, Complex launched The Horus Heresy: Drop Assault, a fast-paced tactics game in conjunction with Games Workshop. In the wake of Drop Assault's success, the studio saw an opportunity. \"We had been wanting for a long time to return to our PC roots,\" he says. \"So we pitched a core idea for a game to Games Workshop, because Drop Assault had been quite successful... and that's essentially how Chaos Gate: Daemonhunters came to be.\"\nRead more",

(Sidebar: having recently conducted an inventory of all my posessions for international shipping purposes, it appears the PS5 is literally the most valuable thing I own. I am 32 years old). I'm not very good at it, to be honest, so recently knocked it down to easy difficulty in order to stomp on robot heads with greater efficiency. Good ol' Aloy.\nAnyway, now that I have awakened a sort of mother-surrogate AI and started the actual business of saving the world, I cannot help but ask the key question: why can I still not ride into battle atop a massive great robot T-Rex?\nRead more",

In about two weeks I'm moving to Ireland, which means for the past four months my live has been hellish. The paperwork the move involves, especially now we have from our European womb been untimely ripped, is a Kafkaesque nightmare. To ship my stuff without incurring importation tax I need to prove I'm going to live in Ireland and not just sell a bunch of second hand cutlery and old bras (one of those two things would probably be pretty lucrative, in fairness). This is all complicated even furtherer by the fact that I only found a flat to move to yesterday, and still don't have the tenancy agreement for it, which means no proof of address. Life, oh life.\nI don't really have the option to have a piece of toast and watch the evening news, because when I'm not scanning my passport or estimating what worth to attach to my towels for the purposes of the shipping company's insurance, I am packing said towels into boxes, along with everything else I own. Basically the only free time I have is my lunch break. And what I am doing in my lunch break is making huge, virtual jigsaw puzzles in Jigsaw Puzzle Dreams. It's either that or go and sit in the toilets and have a little stress-cry. And as the move date approaches, the size of the puzzles has increased. On Thursday I started one that is 6k pieces. This may have been a miscalculation.\nRead more",

It's all about building the power of your evil god under the radar until it's too late for anyone to defeat you.

This is an unfortunate crossover with our 'best horses' special, which I forgot we had done. Also, Nate and I get angry at Metal Gear Solid.\nThere are some traditional digressions, although there's no substantial Henry Cavill update this week. We spend some time discussing which dinosaur we would most like to ride as a mount, and whether we would rather fight one The Rock sized spider, or 30 spider sized The Rocks.

A war of words ensues over whether the Fruit Winder tastes nice. And it's not even a Fruit Winder, it's an app called Facebook, or Twitter, or Instagram, for goodness sakes.\nAdmittedly, there is something gratifying about popping off on social media. Even just getting a few likes for a dumb joke can make you feel alive. So, I say you swap Twitter for Elden Ring, a superior social media platform: You leave players helpful messages or total dross, it gets appraised, you feel great.

For its first 15 hours or so, Smilegate's ARPG is like someone described Lord of the Rings to the developers through a door, an overblown yet generic riff on Western fantasy tropes with overdesigned yet underwritten characters, all of whom talk about the game's plainly ridiculous lore with the gravity of a neutron star. The game's ignorance of its own absurdity is funny, but the story itself is not much fun.\r\n\n\r\nThis begins to change once you approach level 50. After completing the continent of East Luterra, Lost Ark suddenly explodes in scale. It gives you a ship, and sets you off on a massive globetrotting adventure, with around a dozen other continents to explore, and dozens more tiny islands, each with their own little questlines. Your first destination across Lost Ark's ocean is an island called Tortoyk (pronounced like \"Tortoise\", but with a K), and it's here where the game stops pretending to be a serious high-fantasy adventure, revealing itself to be something much more entertaining.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Half the point of the Steam Deck is that it’s portable, but the other half is that it’s a PC. With the right tools, then, you can plug into a monitor, add a mouse and keyboard, and get playing as if it were a (somewhat) conventional gaming rig. But how well does the Steam Deck work as a desktop PC, really? Valve’s use of the Linux-based SteamOS alone makes it less of a 1:1 equivalent to a Windows system, and its AMD APU was designed to handle the onboard display’s 1280x800 resolution – not 1080p and above.\r\n\n \nRead more",

You’ll journey into the bowels of your company, find the miscreants, and scythe them back into work.\nDespite the game’s grim backdrop, it’s a joyful experience stacked with cracking combat and funny characters. The moreish roguelike hook is there, albeit with some early access hiccups to overcome. Give it some time and it could really shine, but whether it’ll get lost in the Steam release cycle before it even has a chance to fill out remains to be seen.\nRead more",

We know that Frey Holland, an orphan trying to make her way in New York City, is abruptly transported to Athia, a mystical realm battered by a deadly blight. Unaffected by the land's spreading corruption, Frey strikes out to find her way home, learning magical combat abilities along the way. But how she gets to Athia, finds herself attached to a talking bangle, and discovers how to use magic is still a mystery.\nRecently we sat down with Forspoken's developers, Luminous Productions, to figure…",

Tekken: Bloodline is set to premiere sometime this year, but there’s no release date to be found in the teaser. There’s also no word on its length or how many episodes it will have.\nHere’s Netflix’s description of the series:\nTekken: Bloodline joins a wealth of video game animated series adaptations coming in the future, many of which are being developed by Netflix. The streaming service isn't just focused on anime and animated series adaptations, though. Last week, it released new details and three new posters for its upcoming Resident Evil series. Whether or not any of these, including Tekken: Bloodline, pan out to be great remains to be seen, but if Netflix’s Arcane is any indication, we’re in for a treat. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer’s Tekken 7 review and then check out this gameplay of Tekken’s Kazuya in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Read about Bandai Namco’s most expensive game to date, which is being developed by Tekken 7 director Katsuhiro Harada, after that. \nAre you excited about Tekken: Bloodline?

The game will also be involved in multiple competitive events, including Arc World Tour 2022, a worldwide tournament tour that will have a $200,000 prize pool split between DNF and Guilty Gear Strive.\nA new character other than the Ghost Blade was shown in the footage, which is the Mechanic that was teased after December's beta period. That would bring the known roster up to 12 characters, with hints at other classes remaining unconfirmed.\nDNF Duel is a fighting game made in collaboration between Arc System Works and Eighting, the development house behind other fighting games such as Ultimate Marvel Vs. Capcom 3 and Bloody Roar. It's based on Dungeon Fighter Online, a Korean MMO brawler made by Neople and published by Nexon, and brings the game's classes to life in a whole new way. Check out our New Gameplay Today to get a look at DNF Duel.\nI've been very excited to play more of DNF Duel since its initial beta in December of last year. Combat is fun, flashy, and easy to execute, using simplified directional inputs for special attacks. It made our list of most anticipated fighting games of 2022 for a reason, and now that we have a release date, it can't come soon enough. DNF Duel will be released on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC on June 28.",

At least not until this new patch it's calling the \"definitive update.\" Check out the trailer above to see some of the big changes in action.\nThe update, slated for release on March 29, will bring a variety of character balance changes. The trailer begins by showing off new combos for a good chunk of the cast, implying there are quite a lot of adjustments being made. Capcom has yet to detail exactly what these changes are but typically releases that information up to a few days before balance changes are implemented.\nAlso in the update are a pair of visual filters that change the way the battles look. The first and more appealing filter adds a cel-shaded styling to the fighters. It brightens up some of the colors in costumes and makes characters look a little more cartoony, which works quite well with the models shown in the trailer. A pixel filter attempting to mimic the look of a CRT screen will also be added in the update. What's present in the footage looks a bit messy (it's hard to make a 3D art style look 2D with a simple filter alone), but I'm going to still give it a shot when the update releases and hope it'll look nicer in person. Both filters are only available in offline modes. Sorry, online warriors. \nTracksuit costumes for each character will finally be getting new color schemes, adding that missing bit of drip your main needs to perform their best in a match. And to round out the update, season 5 characters Dan, Rose, Oro, Akira, and Luke will have new Cap-Jam remix themes added to the game.\nCapcom will be involved in a Japan Fighting Game Publishers Roundtable in the wee hours of March 21 and may talk more about this big update at that time.",

However, likely as a result of Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine (the studio has been vocal about its support for Ukraine), GSC Game World has changed “Chernobyl” to “Chornobyl” to reflect the Ukrainian spelling of the word, as reported by PC Gamer. \nThe change reportedly happened on March 14 by way of a Steam name update. The new spelling is visible in both the standard Steam entry and the title’s description and Steam-related entries. PC Gamer points out that the original spelling can still be seen on some promotional art and other listings, though. \nGSC Game World has not publicly addressed this name change, but the studio is also based in Ukraine and has made it clear it is focusing on keeping its employees safe above all else, opting to sideline the development of Stalker 2 while the conflict continues.\nFor more about Stalker 2, check out the latest look at it.

First reported by Nintendo Life, these Snap cards were given to winners of a Pokémon Snap competition held in Japan decades ago. If you were a winner, your winning Pokémon Snap in-game photograph was turned into an actual Pokémon card, so not only are these rare right off the bat as a result but only 20 of each was made.\nNintendo Life reports that one of 20 Snap Magikarp cards was recently sold at a Japanese auction for 5 million yen, or roughly $136,000. You can watch this video about the card below, uploaded by smpratte, the person who appears to be the winner: \nClick here to watch embedded media\nWith this one sold, there’s another 19 out there somewhere. Perhaps people safely own those other 19, or maybe, they’ve been lost to time. For now, they remain as elusive as a Magikarp doing its best not to bite the bait on an Old Rod (ok, maybe they’re a little more elusive than that). \nFor more, read about the Illustrator Pikachu card sold last month and then check out the upcoming Pokémon Go trading card packs being released in stores soon. \n[Source: Nintendo Life]\nHave you ever seen one of these rare Pokémon Snap cards?

Here’s what to expect with each of these three Sega Genesis games:\nAlien Soldier\n“In Alien Soldier, the acclaimed developers at Treasure invite you to take on the role of a bird-man with steel wings in his fight against 25 bosses. In this challenging game, you can learn new tactics with every defeat…or take advantage of that handy Rewind feature to perfect your run.”\nAlien Soldier is a run-and-gun action game first released for the Genesis in 1995. In the U.S., it was only available via the Sega Channel cable service. The game was re-released on the PlayStation 2, and years later, it was released again on the Wii Virtual Channel and Steam. \nSuper Fantasy Zone\n“Super Fantasy Zone has you powering up the ever-appearing Opa-Opa across eight colorful planets.” \nSuper Fantasy Zone launched on the Sega Genesis, or Mega Drive, in Japan in 1992. It wouldn’t hit the U.S. until 2008, when it was released on the Wii. \nLight Crusader\n“In Light Crusader, also from Treasure, let nobility light your way through a lovingly crafted action-RPG.” \nLight Crusader arrived on the Genesis in 1995, before it was re-released on Steam 15 years later in 2010. It combines elements of RPG, action, and platforming in one package. \nAre you excited about these Sega Genesis games? Let us know in the comments below!",
