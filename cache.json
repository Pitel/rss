Movie on 7th April 2023, but that means that the publicity can only increase from here. Remember that brief period of trepidation where none of us knew what the movie would look, sound, or even remotely be like? Ah, what sweet bliss. Now, we know all of the above and (to the amazement of many) we are almost 100% on board with it!\nThe most recent trailer brought with it even more game references as we got an extended look at Mario's fight with Donkey Kong in which the plumber dons a Cat Suit, presumably due to the appearance of a Super Bell. While the ensuing \"meow\" was enough to send a shiver down our spines, we have to admit that the idea of suits and power-ups appearing throughout the film is a pretty darn cool one.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Highway to hell?\nGiven the critical and commercial success enjoyed by Life is Strange back in 2015, creating a compelling direct sequel can’t have been easy for developer Dontnod. Yet just three years later, players were surprised with a brand new story that was every bit as emotionally affecting as the first, if not more so. It boasts a plot that was both intimate yet grand in scope, taking two core protagonists on a road trip from hell after a tragedy tears them from their comfortable home life. In 2023, though, as the last main part of the Life is Strange puzzle to come to Switch, does the game still hold up? Well, yes… mostly.\nLife is Strange 2 for the Switch contains all five episodes that were originally released over a staggered period of time back in 2019, as you would hope. Each episode will last you a couple of hours or so, so you’re looking at roughly 10-12 hours to complete the whole package, give or take. It uses that time pretty effectively, using the episodic structure to maintain a decent sense of pace throughout.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Music Stages is pretty much the exact same as it was in Theatrhythm Final Fantasy: Curtain Call: once you've unlocked the song, you can play it anytime you want on any difficulty you want.

Not unexpected, necessarily, but we'd hoped to see it continue its exceptionally strong debut. Regardless, seventh is nothing to turn our noses at!\nMeanwhile, the only other new entry bar Dead Space is Square Enix's Forspoken, a game that has received decidedly mixed reception from critics and customers alike.

          "description": "Slog to the Nether Regions.\nYears in the making, Trek to Yomi is the vision of indie developer Leonard Menchiari, backed by Polish studio Flying Wild Hog and publisher Devolver Digital. Essentially a side-on slash 'em up, its hook is its spectacular aesthetic: feudal Japan and the samurai code recreated through cinematic camerawork in striking black and white. An homage to vintage Japanese films – most notably those of Akira Kurosawa – Trek to Yomi is a samurai story of revenge and redemption. It dives into the Shinto underworld of Yomi carrying some moral question marks to add a bit of intrigue.\nThe mood is set in an opening tutorial scene that sees protagonist Hiroki learning sword skills from his master. Suddenly, the master is called away on some serious business and Hiroki sets off in pursuit. What follows is a gorgeous, sweeping run of the camera through Hiroki’s village. Controlling in 3D, as you descend the towering steps from the dojo and follow the road directly down towards to bottom of the screen, the camera dollies backwards along the bustling main street of the village.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Across the Spongeverse.\nA few years ago, Purple Lamp Studios released SpongeBob Squarepants: Battle for Bikini Bottom Rehydrated, a solid revival of a 3D platforming classic from decades past. Sales for that remaster were evidently robust enough to justify development of an all-new sequel, as SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake was announced a little over a year later. Built from the ground up for modern hardware, this new release carries on the spirit of the original while integrating many new ideas and designs of its own. Though The Cosmic Shake isn’t exactly a game that reinvents the 3D platforming wheel, it offers an enjoyable and delightful experience that no fan of this nostalgic genre will want to miss.\nThe Cosmic Shake picks up with SpongeBob and Patrick meeting a mysterious mermaid named Kassandra who offers them a bottle of mermaid tears for them to use as bubble soap. The tears have magical properties and legend has it that they have the ability to grant wishes, but things get out of hand when SpongeBob and Patrick overuse them and tear apart the multiverse. As a result of their mistake, Bikini Bottom has become drenched in cosmic jelly and overrun by strange jelly creatures, while all of SpongeBob and Patrick’s friends have been scattered across the various Wishworlds that opened portals all around town. The two thus set out to repair the damage and collect jelly for Kassandra, who totally doesn’t have ulterior motives.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Maybe it's the list of spin-offs I recently wrote up, which reminded me just how many excellent/terrible Pokémon spin-offs exist out there, or maybe it's the fact that when I was writing my answer to the question \"What Pokémon game should be the next basis for a Legends game?\" my thoughts went immediately to Mystery Dungeon, before realising that, actually, I just wanted another Mystery Dungeon game.\nEither way, that's the truth at the heart of the matter: I think Pokémon Mystery Dungeon needs to be pulled out of the Pokémon archive, dusted off, and given new life. We only have one PMD game on Switch, and it was just a remake of the first game, and it wasn't very good, so I can see why Nintendo might be unwilling to invest so much time and energy into commissioning a new one from developer Spike Chunsoft — but you have to admit that the pitch behind the games is brilliant, and deserves more than just a second look.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

There's the eldest, who will always be heaped with praise because no matter what the others achieve, she did it all first. Her twin is always keen to remind you that even though she's the younger and perhaps not quite as accomplished half of the duo, she's more charismatic and less coy about who she is and what she wants. Then there's the youngest, who's extremely likeable, in large part because she's learned what behaviours to avoid just by watching the others make mistakes; even if she's modelled herself on the eldest a bit too closely in her quest for approval, and so hasn't really forged her own identity.\nThen there's Life Is Strange 2: the awkward middle child. Still very recognisably a member of the family, but the one that stands out in all the photos because he's just a bit gawky. He's experimented a lot with his storytelling and plotline in an attempt to make himself stand out, and it's only sort-of worked. His romantic subplots are underdeveloped, his villains are one-dimensional, and his attempt at tackling a Very Serious Issue has grown in all crooked.\nRead more",

It's the capper on what has been a turbulent month for the company. Three weeks ago Ubisoft announced they were cancelling three unannounced games amid “worsening macroeconomic conditions.” In a letter to employees, CEO Yves Guillemot said that “the ball is in your court” in regard to hitting deadlines and overturning Ubisoft’s sticky financial situation. French union Solidaires Informatique said that Guillemot’s \"words mean something: overtime, managerial pressure, burnout, etc,\" and called on Ubisoft Paris employees to strike for better pay and working hours.

          "description": "The road to launch has been a uniquely turbulent one for The Settlers: New Allies. After an eight-year absence, the next entry in Ubisoft’s beloved city-building series was finally revealed in 2018, only to be delayed indefinitely two years later. The game then reemerged in a fresh new form in 2022, but a less than favourable reception from long-term fans to its closed beta saw the game delayed indefinitely once again.\r\n\n\r\n12 months later, The Settlers: New Allies is all the better for it. An extended delay is never an easy decision to make, yet the team at Ubisoft Düsseldorf (formerly Blue Byte) has seen this additional development time as an opportunity to reach out to those most familiar with the series. “We learned [more] than just what was needed for the game,” creative director Christian Hagerdorn tells me during a recent preview event. “One of our biggest focuses was to be absolutely transparent with the players. Not just on where we were standing, but where we were going. We've been collecting the feedback as we were developing”.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's all very well being able to zoom around doing magic parkour everywhere, but there isn't much to do or many places to go. Not a single talking unicorn to be seen.\nForspoken is somehow both full and devoid of content. There is a huge open world, but it is mostly empty. There is an epic story of magic, other universes, and saving the world, but it only takes up a couple of days. I actually enjoyed a lot of Forspoken, but it gets more fun the more you play, and then it's over; I didn't pre-order this game for sixty odd quid, and if I had I'd be disappointed. Even the much-Tweeted about annoying dialogue doesn't happen much, and isn't contextually annoying. Forspoken is annoying, though, just not in the ways you might expect if all you've seen is people discussing out-of-context clips from cutscenes.\nRead more",

And before him, Ken Levine had laid down the cobbles of Thief’s setting, defining its noir-ish tone before heading off to work on System Shock 2. Yet Looking Glass games weren’t driven by a singular 90s auteur.

There's still much more to Relic Entertainment's sci-fi take on the plot of exiles returning home, though. When Homeworld's Kushan civilisation set out on their journey to the lost planet of Hiigara in the space-year of 1999, the game was doing something very unique compared with most other RTS games on the market.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It’s a belter of a refurb, and for me personally, has been like getting dessert after being forced to finish my Forspoken vegetables. Still, some lingering performance woes on the Deck mean I’m probably going to continue Isaac Clarke’s first and worst job on desktop alone.\nTo be fair, the remake is playable on Valve’s handheld. It’s not outright broken, despite having been so on launch day, with problems ranging from drastic FPS dips to outright hard crashes. Following some impressively fast work from Valve themselves, focusing on hotfixes for SteamOS’ Proton compatibility software, Dead Space’s Deck performance has become more or less manageable. But worthy of the best Steam Deck games? Nope, nein and non.\nRead more",

Players are even able to hide any disturbing scenes, if they want. It’s an interesting option to provide in a full-on horror game.\r\n\n \nRead more",

This is the main reason why I keep returning to Pizza Tower, a 2D platformer by Tour De Pizza that released on Steam yesterday. It’s a bizarre homage to Nintendo’s lesser-known Wario Land series (specifically its fourth entry) that's jam-packed with goofy little drawings that make me laugh.

The original was a Japanese-only release back in 2014 on the PlayStation 3, but what a fever dream it was to be dropped into Chapter 3 of the story and let loose on an Edo period Kyoto as none other than Ryoma Sakamoto (multiverse Kiryu). I almost cried, I raced chickens, I caught a big eel, and I've come away with a warm fuzzy feeling inside.\nFrom what I've played of the game's earliest portions, it's Yakuza through and through, to both its benefit and detriment. I don't expect it to convert those who dislike the series, but if you're a fan or a newcomer, it's looking like it'll both be a celebration of its cast, and a remake that feels like an old-school spin on the excellent Yakuza 0. In other words, the perfect introduction point to this mad, but beautiful action series. \nRead more",

Golf caddy, professional skateboarder, even a part-time dragon slayer. Heck, he's recently been back on the second gig train with his stint in Fortnite just earlier this week.

When we first saw the trailer for Shoulders Of Giants, a few people on team responded with murmurings of \"What the hell is this?\", which increased in frequency and volume as more bizarre things appeared on screen. I sort of did what the Goonies do when they first find the map to One Eyed Willie's treasure, or what anyone in Pulp Fiction does when they open the briefcase: \"Wooooaaaah.\"\nConsider the progress of information. It's a sci-fi roguelike best played, I think, in 4-player online co-op. You play a sword-wielding combat mech. You also control a small frog standing on the mech. You drop onto proc-gen planets overrun by a kind of magical accelerated entropy, that turns everything black and pink and grey. By destroying totemic altars orbited by floating eyeball robots, you start to re-energise the planet, so areas have grass and butterflies. Eventually you will destroy enough totems to get to a planetary boss fight, which might be against, for example, a giant ghost samurai or a floating purple hand with an eyeball in it. It's mad, but I sure do wish more games were like this.\nRead more",

You wander around your home for the last time, choosing five objects which inspire deep memories that spur each of the five senses. You then place them into a cauldron one by one, your mother keeping a watchful eye. The ritual comes to an end and the result is a small glowing pendant that will protect you from the dangers of the outside world. “You must promise me never to take the pendant off,” your mother says. The Goodbye ritual is finished, and you leave, knowing you’ll never see your mother or your hometown ever again, all as the prophecy foretold.\nIt’s a fantastic - if sad - start to Season, and gets straight to the heart of the adventure ahead of you. This is a world where prayers, rituals, and prophecies hold great weight, and where you'll be exploring the fragility and fickleness of memory. Underpinning everything is a deeply profound sense of melancholy - and here I was expecting some relaxing two-wheeling through lovely-looking landscapes. Well, turns out Season is a lot more than a pretty travelogue.\nRead more",

After repeatedly stating that this evening's Xbox Developer Direct would feature just four games, it turned out to contain four. Hi-Fi Rush is a new third-person rhythm action brawler from the makers of Evil Within and Ghostwhire: Tokyo. It's a substantial departure from their previous games in terms of style - although there's an even bigger surprse.\r\n\nThe bigger surprise is it's out now, so you can play it via Game Pass right away.\r\n\n \nRead more",

While Alice Bee hammers her review together, I’ve been on my usual hardware bullshit, mainly investigating the peculiar system requirements that were released last week. \r\n\n\r\nThese aren’t just an odd collection of specs because of the sheer weight and breadth of their demands; they also overtly target resolutions and framerates that hardly anyone is going to be engaging with. Who on desktop plays at 1280x720? Fewer than 0.3% of Steam users, apparently. And personally, if I’ve spent the cash on a 1440p gaming monitor, I probably wouldn’t be satisfied to watch it display my games at just 30fps. I’ve therefore been finding out what PC hardware Forspoken actually needs to run both smoothly and at more realistic resolutions. Maybe then we can update those system requirements to create some very-much-unofficial, but hopefully more useful, spec guidelines.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Alas, that joy was immediately curtailed when I saw FBL wasn't, in fact, coming to PC at all, and would remain a Switch and PS4-only game for the foreseeable future.

These drives are physically larger, slower and not much better value than NVMe M.2 alternatives, but occasionally prices become so low that you have to take notice. \nToday's example is this 480GB Kingston A400 SSD, which has been reduced to under £25 versus an original RRP of £63. That's an astonishing amount of space for the money, and well worth picking up if you have an old machine still running on a HDD. \nRead more",

          "description": "Back in the days of 1987, fantasy point-and-click adventure Shadowgate was notoriously deadly. The type of thing that fell very much into the 'touch anything and you're dead' bracket of early adventure games. Getting eaten by sharks, burned to death by a dragon, and the awkward fate of being dragged into space through a shattered mirror were just some of the ways you could cop it on the black and white Apple Macintosh original. Heck, if you lost your torch while exploring, you'd also fall and break your neck within minutes. Happy days! No doubt, then, that you'll be pleased to hear that the original creators are now making a Shadowgate sequel for PC, more than 35 years after its initial release. Beyond Shadowgate is launching a Kickstarter campaign on February 18th, and promises lots more ridiculous ways to pop your clogs. \nRead more",

Another guy enthusiastically replied that you could add Metaverse features so you could \"live the book\". Don't bother adding to the pile on, because there are no more jokes to make. They have been deluged by people pointing out that TV, films and video games all aready exist.\nThis made me think about, firstly, that we'd be much better off as a society if techbro web3 enthusiasts were all siloed into one giant Truman Show-esque hamster ball where they can all scurry about together thinking they're achieving things. But secondly, that some people really put a lot of store on interactivity. Including me! Graham was the one who sent me those tweets, and he said he wouldn't want to live in any of the books he's been reading, because everyone in them is sad or angry for the whole book, until almost the end. I said I wouldn't want to be in them because you'd only end up being a side character, and that's boring.\nRead more",

          "description": "Most deckbuilding strategy games see you create a single deck of cards over the course of the game. With every completed stage, you're given the chance to add in new cards and take out old duffers, carefully honing those rough edges until it's your very own death by paper cut machine. Mahokenshi isn't most other deckbuilders, though. Here, you're tasked with creating a fresh deck of cards each time you start a new mission, bolstering your initial crop of starter attacks and movement cards with new, more powerful attacks on the fly as you move around its hex-based landscapes. Some can be found out in the wild, but most of them you'll be buying from village merchants, before upgrading them at dojos dotted around the map. And at the end the mission, they're all swept away. \nIt's certainly a refreshing take on deckbuilding, and it lends itself to even more spontaneous wins and comebacks than the usual frisson of tension you get from simply drawing a good or bad hand. But with main story missions quickly ramping up in difficulty, that scramble for bigger and better cards up front is often Mahokenshi's undoing. The whims of chance are felt more keenly than ever in Game Source Studio's debut deckbuilder, and they never quite felt like they're tipped in your favour.\nRead more",

Still, with a  mastery of poise and balance, as well as her innate acrobatic ability, Manon still manages to get more than her fair share of licks in — demonstrating her deceptive reach, a physics-defying arsenal of grabs and throws, and a frankly bizarre \"splits-slide\".\nManon is definitely shaping up to be one of SF6's most interesting newcomers, from both a design and gameplay perspective.\nManon - Walk With Grace\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k5XctUu0Dw&ab_channel=StreetFighter\nManon's theme, \"Walk With Grace\" is a smooth, modern effort, clearly composed to reflect not only the character's personality but also the many strings in her talented bow. The tune starts out with a melody as mysterious and as intriguing as the woman herself, before transitioning to a rhythmic \"stride\" — a beat that conjures up visions of confident models powerfully marching down a catwalk, or the red carpet. As a hybrid superstar, Manon has been afforded a tune that is a blend of her talents, synergizing together her celebrity status, her graceful motion, and her natural, somewhat aloof, sense of mystery.\nStreet Fighter 6 launches June 2 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox. Be sure to check out the themes for Ryu, Chun-Li, Luke, and Jamie, Juri and Kimberly, and Blanka and Dhalsim, in our previous articles.\nThe post Check out Street Fighter 6 star Manon in her latest matchup appeared first on Destructoid.",

In the episode, Mike was being pressured by his three older brothers to evolve his Eevee the way that they evolved theirs.

FFVII would synergize a combination of dramatic storytelling, beloved characters, a then-unheard-of world scale, and the massively popular Sony PlayStation console to spotlight a title that would, eventually, lead a global renaissance for the entire RPG genre — one that has only grown in popularity in the ensuing decades.\nhttps://twitter.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1620255927075995648?s=20&t=buig4p_njufMyjYewXWS6g\n\"The day that Final Fantasy VII came out, was not just a significant day for the Final Fantasy series, but also marked when so many big things started moving for those of us who worked on the game,\" wrote FFVII director Yoshinori Kitase in an anniversary message. \"I remember being overwhelmed at the breakneck speed with which video game technology was evolving, but also dreaming big things for the future. With the establishment of this official anniversary day, I will now always remember these things, and hold them dearly in my heart.\"\nFinal Fantasy VII's legacy lives on in the many re-releases and spin-offs that have hit the market in the past 26 years, not to mention a plethora of merchandise, including model kits, plush toys, figures, statues, and clothing. The world of FFVII has been repeatedly visited in titles such as PS2 release Dirge of Cerberus, the beloved PSP spin-off, Crisis Core, and, more recently, the highly acclaimed Final Fantasy VII Remake, which sees the iconic adventure and its memorable cast of characters return in a fascinating, eyebrow-raising retelling of its (literal) revolutionary narrative.\nThe post Square Enix officially registers January 31 as ‘Final Fantasy VII Day’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

From Xseed Games, Marvelous, and developer SIEG Games, Loop8 follows the exploits of protagonist Nini as he navigates life, friendship, and a demon invasion in 1980s Japan. The game takes place over the month of August in the quaint country town of Ashihara. The town is one of the last sanctuaries on Earth from the demon invasion and Nini, blessed with the power of Demon Sight, can reset time to the beginning of the month each time he and his friends fail to fight off the demon horde.\nOriginally planned to release in North America this spring, Xseed Games confirmed this morning the title is aiming for an early summer release. The announcement comes with the debut of a new trailer that focuses on the slice-of-life aspects of this sci-fi RPG adventure.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEkHQbQBWAg\nI'm trying not to get my hopes up too much on this one, but I'm really digging everything about Summer of Gods.

The Street Fighter franchise is no stranger to the format, having released an excellent port of Street Fighter IV Champion Edition to iOS and Android several years ago. Next month, Ryu and company will return to mobile devices with Street Fighter: Duel, a free-to-play RPG that brings together 40 characters from the fighting game franchise in a new format that focuses on building teams of fighters.\nSo, you know, it sounds like most other mobile RPGs. And while the trailer below doesn't showcase any of Street Fighter: Duel's actual gameplay, if you go to its product page on the App Store or Google Play Store, you should see one screenshot that'll give you an idea of what it looks like in action. Maybe I'm looking too much into this, but I can almost see some inspiration from the wonderful Project X Zone games that have sadly been on ice since 2016.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SH9evri9ezo\nLike with most other mobile RPGs you can download these days, Crunchyroll Games is promising PVP and a new story mode that'll no doubt find plenty of reasons to keep the same group of people constantly at odds with one another. If you're interested in Street Fighter: Duel, preregistration has opened on the App Store and Google Play Store. If anything, I'm sure this game will tide people over until the next \"real\" Street Fighter game launches this summer.\nHere's to hoping it doesn't disappear in less than a year like Puzzle Fighter did.

Created by Crystal Dynamics Eidos Entertainment in collaboration with Navigation Games, the free-to-play title is now available on the iOS App Store and the Google Play Store.\nAs of now, the events of Avatar Generations will follow the adventures of Aang and company from the original series, but subsequent updates will touch on additional Avatar eras like The Rise of Kyoshi and The Legend of Korra. Players who start the game right now will get some welcome rewards, including Aang and Appa as characters to add to their squad. In classic RPG fashion, players will meet various characters from the show and be able to add them to their traveling party, including Katara, Sokka, Zuko, and Toph. Each character has their own set of abilities and special strengths as well, so you'll have some options in how you want to build your team.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV3wPu0sgfM\nAlong with the launch of the game, CDE also shared a new gameplay trailer, which shows off the game's turn-based combat and the adorable chibi art of the characters as they travel in the overworld across the Four Nations. While Avatar Generations is completely free to download, there will be some in-app purchases for \"exclusive items, cosmetics, and more.\" I guess it wouldn't be a free-to-play game without microtransactions, right?\nYou can check out the official Avatar Generations website for any future updates about the game, as well as some events on the horizon.

Tifa's bar, The Seventh Heaven; Cloud's motorcycle, The Hardy-Daytona' and the devastating \"Guard Scorpion\" robot will be among the items awaiting your jet-washing skills.\nhttps://twitter.com/sqex_ee/status/1620252315969265665?s=20&t=0shT7d5tDKcJW45Xt5YSZg\nUnfortunately, FuturLab did not offer up a trailer or release date for the new DLC, but obviously, the team wished to get the news out there on January 31, which is currently in the process of being officially designated \"Final Fantasy VII Day\". We'll be sure to give you a heads-up when more information on the Midgar Special Pack is available.

          "description": "Carpenter weighs in on EA's latest release on Twitter\nServing as the director and composer for over a dozen horror classics, including Halloween, The Thing, and The Fog, John Carpenter has secured his role as one of the greatest horror filmmakers of all time. Fans of his films might not know that Carpenter is also something of a gamer, having expressed an interest in the Fallout, Horizon, and Borderlands series.\nWell, if you missed this detail in the past as I did, now we know that Carpenter is keeping up with the latest horror games, as he took to Twitter (with his aptly-chosen handle @TheHorrorMaster) yesterday to profess his love for EA's Dead Space remake -- more specifically, he called it a \"great game!\" exclamation point included. With so many games trying to imitate cinema, it's really cool to know a film legend who sees the legitimacy and artistic value in the interactive medium.\nhttps://twitter.com/TheHorrorMaster/status/1619855538589937665\nIn an interview with AV Club last year, Carpenter also let in on the fact that he wants to make a Dead Space movie. \"I could do that,\" he said. Not only do I think you could do it, Mr. Carpenter, but I think you'd knock it out of the park. The cold confined indoor space of the Ishimura would be familiar territory for him, especially after helping to create The Thing's setting of an isolated Antarctic research site. I think we're due for another claustrophobic space horror flick, and this franchise would be a match made in heaven with Carpenter.\nWe're already in the middle of a flood of gaming adaptations, such as HBO's The Last of Us series, Amazon's upcoming Fallout series, and a Borderlands movie. Even amidst all these cool projects, I think John Carpenter's take on the Dead Space series would put them all to shame.\nThe post Horror icon John Carpenter calls the Dead Space remake a great game’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

I certainly hope that won't affect my nightmares at all.\nAdditionally, Item Reincarnation looks to add even more reason to grind and upgrade. The A.I. auto-battle function is also seeing an update, which should be great for all those times you don't want to issue commands yourself.\nA demonic strategy\nThe Disgaea series has always offered a signature blend of stylized, cartoon-y devils and immense replayability. Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtueless certainly looks to have more of both. The improved auto-battle options especially seem like a boon, given how much of my experience with Disgaea was grinding to make the numbers go up.\nThis newest Disgaea is already out in Japan, having released on January 26. But it looks like those in the west hopefully won't have to wait longer until this fall, and there are special editions on the NIS store for those who really want to celebrate a new entry.

Websites would sell out in minutes after a restock, and it quickly became something of a status symbol to flaunt on social media, because either you were lucky enough to get one during a drop, or you had enough disposable income to buy one off a scalper. The shortage occurred for a few different reasons, the foremost of which was the strain that the pandemic placed on global supply chains.\nAfter multiple promises that the console would be more readily available, it appears that the shortage has finally come to a close. In an official blog post, Sony Interactive's Vice President of Brand, Hardware, and Peripherals Isabella Tomatis thanked fans for their \"patience as [Sony] navigated unprecedented demand for the PS5 console amid global challenges.\" She then said that anyone who was still looking to get their hands on a PS5 should have a \"much easier time finding one at retailers globally.\"\n[caption id=\"attachment_360393\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1200\"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]\nEven after promises that they'd ramp up production by the end of last year for the holidays, Sony still had a tough time keeping the console on shelves in 2022. Of course, they gave us similar assurances even before that. I was fine without a PS5 to call my own for the past few years, but now that there are some next-gen games on the horizon that I'm actually pumped for, I'm wanting to get on the bandwagon relatively soon. The ever-popular digital-only version of the PS5 (which is also $100 cheaper than the model that can take disks) is still sold out as of my writing this, but at least there are some options available for purchase right now for players who have patiently waited years for their console.\nThe post Sony says that PS5 consoles will be ‘much easier’ to get this year appeared first on Destructoid.",

You have until April 26 to redeem the offer: so if you still play Fallout 76, you may as well head here, click \"OK\" and come back to it eventually.\nCan you believe that it's been over four years since this game launched? It's hard to come to terms with the fact that this didn't fizzle out entirely shortly after launch, but at the very least, the Fallout name is still kicking while Bethesda plans their next move. Hopefully it'll make a bigger splash than Fallout 4 did.\nThe post Fallout 76 just added a small bonus for Prime Gaming subscribers appeared first on Destructoid.",

Arguably, I should have parted with that part of my childhood a few years earlier, but I was a late bloomer. Nevertheless, the misadventures of the little yellow sponge that lived in a pineapple under the sea would fly under my radar for several years. It wasn't until my final year of high school that I, bored at home one afternoon, decided to give the show a go during one of its many marathons.\nI remember the first episode I saw. It was \"Graveyard Shift,\" the episode where SpongeBob and Squidward have to work 24-hour shifts at the Krusty Krab.

She was 45.\nWersching was born in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1977 and pursued the dramatic arts at an early age, training as an Irish stepdancer throughout her schooling before transitioning to the world of the theater during her college years, eventually earning a BFA in Musical Theater in 1999. Wersching's on-screen debut came about in 2002, with an appearance in Star Trek: Enterprise, which would lead to a steady stream of television work, including bit roles in shows such as CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, Birds of Prey, Frasier, Killer Instinct, Boston Legal, Castle, Runaways,…",

          "description": "No sign of the DK Rap, unfortunately\nThis weekend saw the production company Illumination release a short teaser for its fun-looking Super Mario Bros. Movie, an adaptation of one of gaming's most beloved and successful franchises of all time — Notably, the clip features up our first opportunity to hear Seth Rogan's performance of the mighty Donkey Kong, one of many familiar faces that will be showing up in the colorful adventure.\nThe clip rolls out with footage we've seen before, as our boy Mario finds himself on the receiving end of a beatdown from the banana-lovin' ape. Looking to the skies to save him, Mario hits a Question Block and bags himself a Cat Suit, as featured in Wii U release Super Mario 3D World. Unfortunately, Mario's solemn \"Meow\" fails to impress Kong, who promptly mocks him before continuing the ass-kicking.\nhttps://twitter.com/supermariomovie/status/1619795800686739456?s=20&t=fwHS1JERA9tBi1kQ8j3riw\nI'd love to think that the \"Meow\" line is a sly dig at the notorious first trailer for Sonic the Hedgehog, but it's probably just a coincidence. Anyway, you can check out Seth Rogan's snippet of dialogue in the tweet embedded above, and you can watch the original trailer in our previous report. Seth Rogan will be joined by and ensemble cast that includes Chris Pratt (Mario), Anya Taylor-Joy (Peach), Keegan Michael-Key (Toad), Jack Black (Bowser), and Charlie Day (Luigi)\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie is scheduled to launch in theaters in the UK and Europe in late-March. It will premiere in North America on April 7. And, you know what? it's really not looking too bad.\nThe post New Super Mario Bros. Movie clip debuts Seth Rogan’s Donkey Kong appeared first on Destructoid.",

The team is so committed that it’s taking another six weeks to make sure Survivor plays as smoothly as butter. Check out Respawn’s full message below (click the image to enlarge). \n\nStar Wars Jedi: Survivor takes place five years after its predecessor, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order.

          "description": "Crimesight, a social deduction game released last year, got a surprising update on its steam page last night. Despite being out for less than ten months, Konami is ending support for it — and making the game unplayable.\n“Thank you for playing CRIMESIGHT,” the news post reads. “This service has continued to operate with the support of many users since its launch in April 2022, but due to various circumstances, we have decided to terminate the service on Monday, May 01, 2023 at 00:00 PDT.”\nSupport for an online game is bound to end at some point, but seeing the service cut off so quickly has many fans caught off guard. This is also the end of more than just the online modes. At the end of the post, Konami writes, “Also, the game itself won’t be able to play.” As a result, recent Steam reviews have a score of “Mostly Negative,” as players warn future buyers from purchasing a product that will soon be unplayable.\n【Important】 Service Termination Announcement\nhttps://t.co/v71WmsKCzE\nJanuary 30, 2023\nCrimesight is a multiplayer social deduction game set in a futuristic London. Moriarty's team seeks to commit a murder, and Sherlock's team tris to stop that from happening. While it was generally received positively by those that did play it, it didn't gain much traction. With only a handful of reviews on Metacritic and extremely low stats on SteamDB, a site that tracks concurrent player count, it's safe to say that one of Konami's \"various circumstances\" for canceling it is the size of its playerbase.\nIf you want to try it out, you've got until February to buy it, and until May before it stops working. If you want to try playing a different social deduction game, I've heard Among Us is good.\nDo you think Crimesight should stay on Steam? Let us know in the comments!",

However, Capcom and Crunchyroll Games are piling on with a new free-to-play mobile RPG called Street Fighter: Duel. If character collection games like Summoners War, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, and Marvel Strike Force appeal to you, Street Fighter: Duel sounds like it shares many elements with those popular mobile titles.\nStreet Fighter: Duel includes more than 40 Street Fighter characters for players to recruit with the objective of building a team from across the franchise. Each team consists of three fighters who can be leveled up and customized with new skins. These fighters, who include characters like Ryu, Akuma, Chun-Li, Cammy, and more, all feature signature abilities and can pull off various combos through real-time 2D RPG combat or auto-battle mode. In addition to taking on Shadaloo, players can also look forward to head-to-head combat against other players.\n\n\n\"Street Fighter has been an iconic game for generations, and we know anime fans love to go on exciting adventures with beloved characters,\" Crunchyroll Games general manager and Crunchyroll senior vice president of emerging business Terry Li said in a press release. \"We're excited to collaborate with Capcom to bring Street Fighter: Duel and its incredible roster of iconic fighters to anime and gaming fans alike.\nPre-registration for both mobile platforms is available now through the official website. Those who pre-register will be gifted free in-game currency when the game arrives. Street Fighter: Duel is set to launch on iOS and Android in February.",

The game’s phenomenal blend of action and horror combined with its revolutionary over-the-shoulder gameplay cemented it as a bonafide classic, a magic Capcom hopes to recapture with a modernized remake. That reinvention graces Game Informer’s cover this month. \nWe visited Capcom’s headquarters in Osaka, Japan, to play Chapters One and Five of Resident Evil and speak to its principal designers, including directors Yasuhiro Ampo and Kazunori Kadoi, who previously led the Resident Evil 2 remake. You’ll read 12 pages sharing new details on the opening section, breakdowns of Ashley’s gameplay and other new tweaks, plus impressions of the church, cemetery, and house battle segments.\nIssue 353 is also our 2022 Game of the Year issue! This massive spread reflects on the last year in games, featuring Top 10 lists from both the staff and our readers, our individual category awards, editor picks highlighting exceptional titles that didn’t crack the top 10, as well as the staff’s personal top 10 lists. On top of that, we have a great feature detailing the localization process of MMORPGs and previews for anticipated titles such as Death Stranding 2, Armored Core VI, and Hades II. \nYou can also try to nab a Game Informer Gold version of the issue.

As previously promised, the wait is over because Marvel Snap’s new Battle Mode allows players to take on their buddies, and it goes live today.\nBattle Mode allows players to share battle codes with each other for private one-on-one bouts. This match-up consists of multiple back-to-back games with players using the same decks throughout. Players start with 10 health each and whoever wins a game deals 1 point of damage. However, this damage can be doubled by snapping. A player loses when their health hits zero, and there’s no round limit. Developer Second Dinner states that Battle Mode will receive updates expanding its features over the coming months. \nFor more on Marvel Snap, check out its spot on our Top 10 Games of 2022 to find out what makes it so special.

Made up of multiple netherworlds, the underworld residents followed the bushido code of honor until a tyrannical regime took over to promote a code of destruction. A pair of unlikely allies must team up to stop this threat: a lazy samurai named Futo and a hyperactive otaku girl named Pirilika. \n\n\nDisgaea 7 boasts over 40 character classes, including four new ones: Maiko, Bandit, Zombie Maiden, and Big Eye. It also retains the 3D sprites introduced in Disgaea 6. New mechanics include Jumbofication, which turns characters into super-sized versions of themselves to inflict massive attack damage. Item Reincarnation lets you transform equipment and items into new forms, such as turning a weapon into a healing item. Auto-battles have been improved with deeper character customization. Now, your forces can stand a better chance against other players' troops in the new online ranked battles. \nUnlike Disgaea 6, a Switch exclusive at launch, Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtuless will be available on multiple platforms on day one.

          "description": "Nintendo and Illumination have released a new teaser that reveals Mario's famous cat suit as well as more of Seth Rogen's Donkey Kong. \nReleased during one of yesterday's big NFL games, this teaser is short and sweet, but it features 10 or so seconds of new footage from The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which hits theaters on April 7. In it, we see Donkey Kong begin to pummel Mario, which is a clip we've seen before, before Mario hits a yellow \"?\" block. This gives him the cat suit powerup and while it's useful in the game, that doesn't appear to be the case here as Rogen's Donkey Kong begins to make fun of the suit and Mario's reliance on it. \nCheck it out for yourself in The Super Mario Bros. Movie clip below: \n\n\nAs you can see, this is the most Donkey Kong dialogue we have heard in a teaser for The Super Mario Bros. Movie yet, and it reveals that Rogen's character is basically just him, complete with his signature laugh, too. This clip is yet another that looks great and we can't wait for this movie to hit theaters in a few months on April 7. \nFor more, check out this trailer from last year that showcases Anya Taylor-Joy's Princess Peach. \nWhat do you think of this new clip?

Today is that long-awaited day, as one of the most beloved and influential games from its era is available now on both platforms. While these versions are both largely faithful recreations of the seminal console FPS, key differences exist in ways that don't immediately surface one as the clearly superior version. I played a decent chunk of both versions to see which one I prefer to play in 2023.\nWhen GoldenEye 007 launched in the late 1990s, I played it obsessively both solo and with friends for months upon months.

Season 1, so far, has been largely viewed as a success by critics and viewers alike. News of a second season isn't surprising because The Last of Us' premiere was the second largest debut for an HBO original series since 2010, and its second episode had the largest audience increase from a first episode to a second episode for an HBO Original drama series in the history of the network. \nCheck out the Season 2 announcement for HBO's The Last of Us below: \nThe journey continues. #TheLastOfUs will return for another season on @HBOMax. pic.twitter.com/FQNG6vhk1d\nJanuary 27, 2023\nAs for what to expect in Season 2, that remains unknown, but considering Season 1 is covering all of The Last of Us Part I, it's likely that the second season will cover at least part of The Last of Us Part II, if not all of it. A release date for Season 2 has not yet been revealed. \nEpisode 3 of HBO's The Last of Us airs this Sunday and is set to feature Bill, played by Nick Offerman. \nWhile waiting for this week's episode, read our interview with game co-creator Neil Druckmann and Joel actor Pedro Pascal about how The Last of Us was changed for TV, and then read about how there are no plans for The Last of Us show to go beyond the games. \nWhat do you think Season 2 of The Last of Us will cover?

In addition to detailing how players will liberate the town of Redfall from its vampiric captors, the team also shared a release date: May 2.\nThe bulk of the presentation showed off how players, either alone or working with up to three other friends, will cleanse Redfall of vampires neighborhood by neighborhood. In addition to gathering intel about the island and completing side quests, such as rescuing human hostages, you’ll capture safehouses. These become additional human HQs, and gaining more brings you closer to battling the area’s ruling vampire underboss. These elite enemies boast unique attacks and require your full might, along with your team’s efforts, to kill for good.\n\n\nWe also got a look at vampire nests. A giant heart fuels these otherworldly dens, and infiltrating one means cutting the heart from the body. Swarms of vampires will try to stop you, of course, but succeeding causes the collapse of a nest, meaning you’ll have to get out fast. Additionally, Arkane showed off the Shroud enemy type, a vampire that can blanket areas in pitch darkness, fire projectiles, as well as phase through floors to evade danger. We also saw a little more of the heroes’ specialized abilities and upgrades, such as granting Layla’s umbrella with a perk that allows it to absorb and fire incoming bullets. \nRedfall will be available on Xbox Series X/S and PC and will be available on Game Pass at launch.",

Aesthetically, Hi-Fi Rush sits somewhere between Insomniac Games' Sunset Overdrive and a Saturday morning cartoon – which is to say, bright, over-the-top, and colorful. A far cry from Tango's other outings, such as The Evil Within series and last year's Ghostwire: Tokyo, which both emphasize horror and the supernatural. \nCheck out the trailer below:\n\n\nHi-Fi Rush is available later today on PC and Xbox consoles via Game Pass.

In addition to new details on PvP, we learned the game is coming to Xbox and PC on April 18, just a few months from now. Like most first-party Xbox titles, it will be available on Game Pass day one. We also got a new gameplay trailer, which you can watch below.\n\n\nIf you're unfamiliar, Minecraft Legends is an action strategy game where players explore a procedurally generated world to find resources, build bases, and save the overworld. In the campaign, which can be played solo or co-op, players work together to stop Piglins from invading their world from the Nether. While traditional Minecraft gameplay has the player placing each individual block, this game allows you to build on a larger scale, placing walls, traps, and turrets. \nIn the PvP mode, two teams of up to four players will face off in a battle to destroy the other team's base. Like the campaign, the world is procedurally generated, so every match is different. Throughout the showcase, developers at Mojang and Blackbird Interactive detailed their favorite strategies, like layering walls with traps in between or exploring the world to find rare mobs. Multiplayer also features cross-platform play and online matchmaking.\nA blog post on the Xbox website also announced that a Deluxe Edition would be available at launch. It includes the base game and a bonus pack of skins. Minecraft Legends releases April 18.",

And now, Episode 2 of The Last of Us, \"Infected,\" has broken another HBO record.\n\"Infected\" brought in 5.7 million viewers across HBO and HBO Max streams, marking a 22% increase over last week's 4.7-million premiere. That increase is the largest audience increase from a first episode to a second episode for an original drama series on HBO in the network's history, as first reported by Variety. HBO calls it the \"largest week 2 audience growth for an HBO Original drama series in the history of the network,\" which speaks further to the wide success of The Last of Us. \nWeirdly enough, even though HBO is usually quick to capitalize on series success with an announcement of a second or sequel season, it has not yet done that for The Last of Us, although every sign points to a greenlight for a Season 2. \nEpisode 1 of The Last of Us crossed 10 million viewers after just two days last week and now, Variety reports that it is tracking 18 million, which is nearly four times its premiere night audience. \nWhile waiting for this week's episode, read our interview with game co-creator Neil Druckmann and Joel actor Pedro Pascal about how The Last of Us was changed for TV, and then read about how there are no plans for The Last of Us show to go beyond the games. \n[Source: Variety]\nDid you like Episode 2 more than Episode 1?
