Digital Eclipse has today announced that a pair of mighty-looking updates will be heading to Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind in the coming months, adding in fresh gameplay features, new moves and an expanded scope for online co-op.\nThe first of these updates is set to land on PC and console at some point this week, though Digital Eclipse warns that it's expected to come to Switch \"shortly afterwards\".

It was perhaps only a year or two after the game first released on Wii U, in fact, that we last played it, and our overriding memory (besides the fact that it's incredible) is of an experience that needed to be unshackled, at a fundamental level, from hardware that was holding it back.\nNow, it's not like Xenoblade Chronicles X was a mess or anything like that. It ran at a locked 30fps, as far as we recall, and it looked amazing, but it was a slice of sci-fi that often felt muddy, hard to read, and unwieldy when it shouldn't. The sort of game that was crying out for a great big resolution bump so we could enjoy its gorgeous locations in full, at the very least.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "This article contains moderate spoilers for the closing events of the Wedding Crashers quest in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.\n\r\nIt’s impossible, I think, to play Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 without playing a boozer, even if you’re only boozing in cutscenes. The game’s 15th century world is greased by many splendours of hooch, from the wine used in potion-brewing through the finer vintages at banqueting tables to the viral pondwater they sell in seedier taverns. A lot of the time, the writing views alcohol as a means of teeing up some slapstick debauchery reminiscent of Paul Bettany’s character in A Knight’s Tale. It venerates the spectacle of having a large one, with custom dialogue and voice-acting for protagonist Henry when you woozily explain your antics to guards. But sometimes, perhaps despite itself, it expresses something about the culture of drinking and the unpleasantness of being militantly exhorted to drink.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "The psychology of people who cheat in competitive games remains deeply mysterious to me, but I'll hazard a guess it stems from a love of ruining someone's day rather than any real sense of accomplishment. Something I am interested in, however, is the idea of play as transgression.\nThere is, for example, a subset of people who get very irritated at the concept of speedruns. I suspect this is because, even if we aren't consciously engaged with a game's story, there's an underlying sense of what I'm going to very clumsily call 'narrative correctness' that's absolutely shattered when, say, Leon Kennedy starts shuffling up stairs at superhuman speeds. Glitches, warps, and other exploits expose the shroud of storytelling conjured by every little piece of a game's design, pulling off the mask so the underlying grey box is painfully visible. They call art a liar.\nCompetitive FPS Cheaters Cheetah initially seems like pure transgression against any sense of fair play or even level design, but the key here is that everyone gets cheats like aimbots, wallhacks, and spinbots. \"This creates a unique dynamic,\" reads the game's Steam page, \"where everyone knows everyone else's position, leading to intense mind games and thrilling battles\". It sounds like it's either going to be a complete disaster or incredibly interesting, probably both.\nRead more",

Oh, you're giving me a 'ratvolver' and letting me build 'turrats' and there's a dramatic close-up of swinging rat balls in the intro montage for each stage? Yeah, go on then. It's got the vibes of something made by the guy you knew in secondary school who exclusively drew pictures of cartoon dicks but, like, they were undeniably really good dicks. Absolute cock prodigy, that guy. Pablo Dickasso.\nAnyway, I'm probably making it sound like there's a serious dick to rat ratio here but it's really just those balls. There are some great rat animations though. It's a 2D strategy tug-of-war where you push through stages summoning troops and building structures, and when you do, you're treated to a bunch of rats with hammers piling up construction barriers. When enemy rats fall, either to your own guns or your army of Ratineeers, gangs of regular-sized rats come to nibble on their corpses. They also say things like \"Tell my wife…squeak\".\nAlso I am 95% sure your Ratvolver fires legally distinct warpstone. They saw me coming, I tell you.\nRead more",

It's hard not to with Majima back; moisturised, flourishing, driving a six-inch tanto knife into a man's kidneys for being mildly rude to him on the beach, and abducting monkeys for his petting zoo. He's also the captain of a pirate ship now, having woken on a strange island with no memory of his Yakuza past, but the same sense of fair play and manic flair for theatrical shankings. Plus, he's already got the eyepatch sorted.\nWhy are there actual, cannon-wielding, tricorn-headed pirates off the coast of Hawaii? Shhh. Just get on the boat. You do find the idea of a Majima being a pirate entertaining enough on its own to last you twenty five hours, don't you?

This saw you choosing methods of gaining NPC affection from a disc with quadrants labelled \"Admire\", \"Joke\", \"Coerce\" and \"Boast\", each of which elicits a different response previewed by the NPC's gurnishly changing expression. \nYou have to choose all four options at least once per round, and the underlying \"pie\" rotates every time you pick one. The underlying segments are partially filled in to show how much they'll affect the NPC's opinion, for better or worse. The idea, then is to match responses that have a positive effect to the largest chunks of pie, by picking them in the right order.

A reboot can completely reinvent an old character, intriguing players in the same way an adaptation of Macbeth might excite a theatre dweeb. But remasters often feel like someone has plainly yet painstakingly rolled over every inch of the original with linoleum. The worst remasters bring to mind the Spanish pensioner who butchered a fresco of Jesus Christ. As acts of restoration go, Aspyr's work on Tomb Raider (and Soul Reaver) isn't quite that egregious. Hard work has gone into updating the scenery and textures. Basic vine sprites become handsome twirls of plantlife. Egyptian reliefs are given form. But there's a limit to this unfurling of digital lino. The results ultimately evoke the look common in mobile games when smartphones were becoming ever more powerful. This is Lara Croft if she were designed by Gameloft in 2011.\nRead more",

The PC version does, however, still seem to have a few loose wires, which are worth watching out for even if you can tidy some up with the right settings.\nRead more",

The silly amount of tags for this semi-regular format are surely proof of its enduring appeal, so we're back in Hivemind form to talk about Obsidian's latest RPG Avowed. We've all played it, and we all have mildly different opinions on it - the stuff that thrilling conversations are made of. Onward!\nNic: James did you work out how to freeze things yet?\nJames: I’ll explain this quickly so Nic can get on to complaining about Avowed having the wrong kinds of boxes. But yes, I did get stuck on an early main quest that required me to use ice magic to create frozen platforms for crossing water, an otherwise neat little systems thingy that had not been communicated or hinted at before that point, but was communicated and hinted at during the following main quest.\nOtherwise, I’m having an okayish time? It doesn’t have the Skyrim-tier expansiveness I always hope for with these kinds of games, but its world is a pretty one, and it’s got some quality close-quarters mageing.\nNic: Look. I feel passionately about those crates. There are two types of crates. You can only smash the crates that have the special 'smash me' icon on them. I don't want a crate to \"come hither\" me. Takes all the fun out of the petty vandalism.\nIt's funny though because those two qualities you mention, James - the world and magic - are the same ones I thought were Avowed's strongest elements. How are you both finding the actual questing?\nRead more",

I'd run through all the ways Obsidian's latest didn't quite do it for me, most of you would go play it anyway because it's on Games Pass, and we'd all go back to patiently waiting for the sun to explode.\nBut, god, what a devastatingly gorgeous open-zoned world this is. What a triumphantly weird, sprawling playground of fantasy naturalia. What a treat it is to just climb all over, its design ethos captured in the first magical ring I found offering a 15% buff to parkour speed.\nIgnore two thirds of the weapons and just roll a wizard to witness the stodgy melee combat of other classes give way to crackling, cackling spell-slinging. There is such a gulf of quality here it's like playing two different games. I spent 27 hours having a meh ol' time until a reinstallation of Nvidia's loathsome app deleted 200 some screenshots and I had to restart. Why not play a wizard? I thought. Why not indeed. Suddenly, I'm frying whole families of lizards at once with chain lightning and grinning like Palpatine in a pet shop.\n \nRead more",

The jubilant news comes from Remedy latest financial report, as spotted by VG247.\nAs of September last year, the musical-with-guns had \"recouped most of its development and marketing expenses\", but still wasn't quite in the green. Since then, they've released both The Lake House expansion and physical console editions, which appear to have done the trick. \"October saw particularly high activity around Alan Wake 2,\" says the report.\n \nRead more",

They've yet to specify how many people have been affected - according to a leaked memo from Unity CEO Matthew Bromberg, those concerned will be notified today - but several Unity employees have confirmed that they're now looking for work on LinkedIn, amongst them senior technical artist Peter Roe and senior software developer Coline Turquin. In his LinkedIn post, Roe describes the layoffs as \"completely abrupt and impersonal\". Apparently, a noreply address contacted him at 5am local time to reveal that he'd lose access to systems by the end of the day. Funny stuff.\n Read more",

          "description": "Ex-Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick has called a 2021 petition signed by over a thousand Activision Blizzard employees to remove him as CEO \"fake\", and suggests that harassment claims and legal cases brought against Activision Blizzard were engineered by the Communication Workers of Union in a bid to attract new members. Kotick made the comments during an appearance on Grit, a business podcast by American venture capital company Kleiner Perkins. He appeared on the podcast with former EA CEO Bing Gordon (thanks, Gamespot), to talk about both their company histories.\nKotick's statements reference widely reported incidents alleging a company culture of harassment, intimidation, and pay inequity around the time - coinciding with a lawsuit against the company - and the petition referred to appears to be this one to remove him as CEO, which attracted over a thousand signatures.\nThat petition followed a report by the Wall Street Journal (paywalled) that highlighted several alleged incidents of harassment by Activision staff, alongside reports that Kotick was aware of these allegations but did not inform the company's board of directors, and intervened to prevent the firing of an alleged harasser. It wasn't just Activision workers who found these claims alarming: a group of company shareholders called for Kotick's resignation soon after. Kotick denied any wrongdoing.\nRead more",

Obviously I can't actually respond to that, so I'll just do the bad news first and if you chose differently you can always tip your monitor upside down, hang from the ceiling, or just work your way up the article from the bottom: tributary horror demake Bloodborne PSX is no more. As reported by The Verge (thanks PC Gamer), LW Media's Lilith Walther has received a copyright takedown notice from firm MarkScan on behalf of Sony Interactive, accusing Bloodborne PSX of 'digital piracy'. The game was previously available on Itch for three years without issue.\nThis follows a recent DMCA takedown of a YouTube video promoting Bloodborne PSX, as chronicled by noted good modsman Lance McDonald below. As McDonald mentions, MarkScan were also responsible for another recent strike against his own 60fps Bloodborne mod, which had been available without issue since 2021.\nRead more",

Yet beyond the sparkling glamour of marketing slides, however, path tracing remains exceptionally niche: nearly six years since Quake II RTX served as the tech’s de facto gaming debut, you can still count the number of compatible games on your fingers. Compare and contrast with the dozens upon dozens of games that have embraced ray tracing, path tracing’s less demanding nephew, and you’ll likely start wondering why more game devs don’t go for it.\nWe’re not here to answer that, though. This is Should You Bother With, here to investigate whether you should start using path traced effects to give your games – some of them, anyway – the full maxed-out-visuals treatment.

          "description": "True to the word of Capcom’s German social media marketing, Monster Hunter Wilds has a new, generally less extravagant set of PC system requirements ahead of its February 28th launch. There’s also a standalone benchmark tool that you can download from the game’s Steam page, so you can see for yourself how the beast-biffing RPG will run on your hardware.\nIn theory, these are great developments. Lower requirements mean a more widely accessible game, and the benchmark tool – which covers a good six minutes of combined cinematics and simulated free roaming – brings reassurance and accountability to this otherwise hype-reliant prerelease period. Sadly, there are two problems. One, the benchmark confirms outright that Monster Hunter Wilds will run like stagnant goulash on low-end PCs, and two, it does so to the extent that I’m not sure that the revised minimum specs are even reliable.\nRead more",

This ends the fight immediately. Sometimes I resort to this low move out of frustration, when a dull fight has dragged on for too long. Sometimes I resort to it out of panic, because I’ve accidentally set fire to every hard surface within ten feet, or frozen myself to a wall. Often it’s just for the pleasure of it. \r\n\nIn Eternal Strands, Yellow Brick Games’ debut title, you play the leader of a \"weaver band\", a crew of freelance magicians, in a world where something extremely bad happened to magic. Some years ago, the Enclave, a city state acting as the isolationist heart of the world’s magic, exploded in a kind of power surge - one part tsunami, one part blown fuse - and just as quickly sealed itself off from the world outside. Somehow managing to breach the wall, your band finds themselves the first people to set foot inside the ruined capital since the calamity and sets about uncovering the mystery of what exactly went wrong. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "If the latest rumors are to be believed, the Joao Felix Fantasy FC SBC is going to be added to EA FC 25 Ultimate Team as part of the next campaign.\n\n\nEA Sports have already confirmed Fantasy FC and most of the new cards will be available in packs. However, some cards like Joao Felix are going to be added via SBCs and objectives, making it easier for all to get them. While EA Sports hasn't announced details about the upcoming SBC, here are my predictions about its release date and possible costs.\n\n\nEA FC 25 Joao Felix Fantasy FC SBC release date (Expected)\n\n\nThe Fantasy FC promo begins on Friday, February 21. Typically, EA Sports always schedules a big SBC on the first night of a new promo. If I had to predict, Felix could well be that on SBC, and fans could end up getting the card as early as Friday, February 21.\n\n\nHowever, weekends are also possible dates for EA Sports to release big SBCs in Ultimate Team. Hence, February 22 or February 23 could also be possible dates for the challenge to be released in Ultimate Team.\n\n\nEA FC 25 Joao Felix Fantasy FC SBC costs (Predicted)\n\n\nThere have been very few SBCs this year that have been in the middle of the road when it comes to completion costs. I feel that the Joao Felix Fantasy FC SBC could be priced similarly along with the Ferland Mendy Grassroot Greats SBC. Hence, it's best to reserve around 600,000 coins worth of fodder if you want to add Felix to your squad.\n\n\nIf you're unwilling to wait, there are some worthy choices to consider from the ongoing Grassroot Greats SBC. N'Golo Kante is an exceptional defensive midfielder you can add to your squad, who will boss the middle of the field. If you're on a shorter budget, the Moise Bombito Grassroot Greats SBC offers excellent value at less than 100,000 coins worth of fodder.\n\nThe post EA FC 25 Joao Felix Fantasy FC SBC leaked: Expected release date, costs, and more appeared first on Destructoid.",

The most hype reveals so far, were those of Cloud and Tidus, who'll be part of the commander set.\n\n\nImage via Wizards Of The Coast\n\n\nThese are the two main characters in the two most successful Final Fantasy titles so far, meaning Wizards would naturally be big selling points for this new set.

          "description": "If you've been holding out—and I have to be honest, missing out—on playing developer Wrong Organ's psychological-horror title Mouthwashing, well now you have no excuse. Publisher Critical Reflex announced today that Mouthwashing will be heading to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch later this year.\n\n\n\n\nThe unique horror game that uses nostalgic PSX-style visuals to tell the haunting tale of the doomed crew aboard a space freighter called the Tulpar was released on Steam in September 2024 and has sold over 500,000 copies on the platform. According to Critical Reflex, fans interested in a physical edition on the PS5 or Switch will have the opportunity to snag one through Fangamer.\n\n\nHonestly, Mouthwashing is one of those games that that least you know going into it, the better. If you're a fan of psychological horror games that are a bit out there in terms of narrative and setting, you won't find a better example. However, if you want to have somewhat of an idea of what to expect, here is the premise:\n\n\nIn Mouthwashing you explore the story of a dying crew aboard a shipwrecked space freighter hauling mouthwash across the expanse of space. You'll switch between various crew members in first-person as you explore what caused the shipwreck as well as what has transpired since, all while trying to come up with a gameplan. The ship will only stay powered for a few months, and food will run out well before then. But at least there's mouthwash, right? For the most part it's a narrative-driven experience, and one well worth experiencing.\n\n\nThe crew of the Tulpar and Mouthwashing crashlands on PlayStation, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch later this year. Those interested in playing now can do so on PC via Steam.\n\n\n\nThe post PSX-style psychological horror Mouthwashing heading to consoles later this year appeared first on Destructoid.",

Although we caught a glimpse at this update in a previous content roadmap, we now know that Princess Jasmine and Aladdin are coming to Disney Dreamlight Valley on February 26, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nWe initially learned about Princess Jasmine and Aladdin’s update through DDV’s October 2024 Showcase, revealing a 2025 free content roadmap that included their arrival in “Early 2025.” While this didn’t specify a month, it suggested we’d see them sometime between January and March. Though Gameloft didn’t reveal much more after, their latest video showcases everything, from a new realm to its release date.\n\n\nImage via Gameloft\n\n\nAs revealed through an official DDV character announcement, Tales of Agrabah will feature a new realm where you’ll meet Jasmine and Aladdin. However, the realm is in disarray, so it’ll be up to you to work with them to restore Agrabah to its former glory. Maybe Jafar’s influence in Rift in Time is carrying over to this realm, too.\n\n\nThe Tales of Agrabah update also comes with Aladdin’s flying carpet as a new companion and a Gem Stall once you advance through Aladdin’s friendship questline. There’s no word yet on whether we’re getting new cooking recipes, but knowing previous updates, we’ll likely see a few related to Agrabah’s cuisine. As usual, we’ll be able to invite both Jasmine and Aladdin to Dreamlight Valley as we finish their realm’s quests, but the details of what this entails are still unknown.\n\n\nDisney Dreamlight Valley’s Tales of Agrabah update is arriving on February 26, 2025.\n\nThe post It’s official, Disney Dreamlight Valley’s Aladdin realm is coming sooner than anyone would’ve expected appeared first on Destructoid.",

And if the letter isn't in the answer, it turns black.\n\n\nThe game's simplistic rules paired well with its interface: a five-by-six grid of 30 individual squares laid against a black background.

Canal+ and the football league LFP have requested court orders to compel NordVPN, ExpressVPN, ProtonVPN, and others to block access to pirate sites and services. The move follows similar orders obtained last year against DNS resolvers.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

          "description": "God of Thunder, the Zelda-esque game, is now ready for public testing!\nPrepare yourself to take on the role of Thor, the god of thunder, as he battles his way through the three part game, facing enemies and challenging environmental puzzles, all to finally face down challenging end bosses, culminating in Loki himself.\nThe implementation in ScummVM is slightly different from the original, in that whilst it has a high score table like the original, you don't have to go through the steps of creating an account and being limited to only a single savegame. Also, unfortunately, the game uses a special music format that will need to be implemented from scratch by someone with experience. So for now, no music playback will occur, though in-game sound effects play back fine.\nTo participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. The game itself is freeware, and can be downloaded from the Adept Software website. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.And please take some screenshots along the way.\nHave you the skill to defeat Loki, or will you be defeated by the cunning enemies, or be stymied figuring out the puzzles. Play, and find out.\n>",
