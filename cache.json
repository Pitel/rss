In it, the publisher states that it expects to reach a record 40 million in unit sales by the end of the period, driven in large part by the Monster Hunter and Resident Evil franchises.\nThe forecast comes after the publisher confirmed it has sold an incredible 29.1 million units during the fiscal year so far, up from 25.8 million the year prior. This is primarily due to the growth of catalog titles, including the remarkably successful launch of Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, which recently surpassed 5 million units sold.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Maybe it's the list of spin-offs I recently wrote up, which reminded me just how many excellent/terrible Pokémon spin-offs exist out there, or maybe it's the fact that when I was writing my answer to the question \"What Pokémon game should be the next basis for a Legends game?\" my thoughts went immediately to Mystery Dungeon, before realising that, actually, I just wanted another Mystery Dungeon game.\nEither way, that's the truth at the heart of the matter: I think Pokémon Mystery Dungeon needs to be pulled out of the Pokémon archive, dusted off, and given new life. We only have one PMD game on Switch, and it was just a remake of the first game, and it wasn't very good, so I can see why Nintendo might be unwilling to invest so much time and energy into commissioning a new one from developer Spike Chunsoft — but you have to admit that the pitch behind the games is brilliant, and deserves more than just a second look.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

This was a theory which stated that it was possible to unlock the face textures for previous Bond actors Sean Connery, Roger Moore, and Timothy Dalton in the game's multiplayer mode after completing a series of near-impossible tasks.\nThis was, of course, not true (regardless of what Nintendo-working uncles might tell you); although the face textures of these past Bonds did exist in the game's ROM in some rudimentary form after initial plans to add the actors were scrapped thanks to some pesky legal worries. While the other Bond models were removed completely, the face textures were instead moved to the 'unused pile' rather than risk deleting anything else from the game's build so close to release.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Just a handful of years ago this might have seemed like a pipedream, but with Banjo and Kazooie's appearance in Smash Bros. Ultimate apparently helping to establish a 'relationship' between Nintendo and Microsoft — the owners of Rare for over 20 years now — having the Twycross developer's work appearing once again on a Nintendo platform isn't such a strange idea anymore.\nThere's still a suite of games from the developer's golden years that could potentially come to Nintendo Switch Online. Most are available on Xbox as part of the sublime Rare Replay package, and some of them, specifically those featuring Nintendo IP, are perhaps more likely to make an appearance on Switch than others.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The game shoves aside many traditional Pokémon mechanics and introduced various new features, but the hunt to fulfill Arceus' wishes of \"seeing all Pokémon\" (this god has the power to give you a phone in the Pokéworld, apparently) is the ultimate goal.

Japan-based developer Team Ladybug, more recently known for the rather good Record of Lodoss War: Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth, has had the Switch shooting game hardcore waiting eight months since the game’s Steam release, but does it live up to the hype?\nDrainus pays homage to many genre classics; a touch of Border Down in its ship functions and styling, a nod to Einhander in the aesthetic of its stage-two train assault, and plenty of Gradius V in its transforming boss phases. The one influence that’s been touted heavily in previews, inexplicably, is Ikaruga, as if it’s the only other title in the genre the mainstream gaming press has ever heard of. While Drainus features a system of absorbing enemy fire that can be returned in a flurry of homing lasers, the execution here has far more in common with Takumi’s Giga Wing than it does Treasure’s puzzle-shmup hybrid, making it a largely erroneous comparison.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Still, some lingering performance woes on the Deck mean I’m probably going to continue Isaac Clarke’s first and worst job on desktop alone.\nTo be fair, the remake is playable on Valve’s handheld. It’s not outright broken, despite having been so on launch day, with problems ranging from drastic FPS dips to outright hard crashes. Following some impressively fast work from Valve themselves, focusing on hotfixes for SteamOS’ Proton compatibility software, Dead Space’s Deck performance has become more or less manageable.

But that's precisely what makes Ludipe’s alt-ctrl game Tie Simulator 2020 so wonderfully weird. As many RPS Treehouse members found out at EGX 2022, it's a game that sees you holding your keyboard vertically, and pressing buttons to (sort of) tie your tie onscreen. Now, Ludipe's back with a new co-op sequel called Back Scratching Simulator 2023 where you're once again doing terrible, but brilliant things with a vertical keyboard.\nRead more",

          "description": "Above the Berlin Samurai Museum's gift shop and flanked by ornate helmets of fearsome warriors of a bygone era, I played a few hours of Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio's remake of historical Yakuza spin-off Like A Dragon: Ishin this week. The original was a Japanese-only release back in 2014 on the PlayStation 3, but what a fever dream it was to be dropped into Chapter 3 of the story and let loose on an Edo period Kyoto as none other than Ryoma Sakamoto (multiverse Kiryu). I almost cried, I raced chickens, I caught a big eel, and I've come away with a warm fuzzy feeling inside.\nFrom what I've played of the game's earliest portions, it's Yakuza through and through, to both its benefit and detriment. I don't expect it to convert those who dislike the series, but if you're a fan or a newcomer, it's looking like it'll both be a celebration of its cast, and a remake that feels like an old-school spin on the excellent Yakuza 0. In other words, the perfect introduction point to this mad, but beautiful action series. \nRead more",

What a resume!\nBut did you know that our favourite space engineer also has lots of secret talents too? When Dead Space originally came out in the back end of 2008, his corporate overseers at EA sent Mr. Clarke to do all sorts of odd jobs before he popped off on the believeable, but bleak USG Ishimiura. Golf caddy, professional skateboarder, even a part-time dragon slayer. Heck, he's recently been back on the second gig train with his stint in Fortnite just earlier this week.

It's a sci-fi roguelike best played, I think, in 4-player online co-op. You play a sword-wielding combat mech. You also control a small frog standing on the mech. You drop onto proc-gen planets overrun by a kind of magical accelerated entropy, that turns everything black and pink and grey. By destroying totemic altars orbited by floating eyeball robots, you start to re-energise the planet, so areas have grass and butterflies. Eventually you will destroy enough totems to get to a planetary boss fight, which might be against, for example, a giant ghost samurai or a floating purple hand with an eyeball in it.

With some small but welcome exceptions, Dead Space is a one-to-one remake of the 2008 original.\r\n\n\r\nYour opinion on whether that is a good thing or not will depend on how you feel about the endeavour of remaking games from fifteen years ago in the first place. As far as I’m concerned, this remake allowed me to replay one of my all-time favourite games in a lavish new form, and in that sense, Dead Space is extraordinary.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Season: A Letter To The Future begins with a goodbye. You wander around your home for the last time, choosing five objects which inspire deep memories that spur each of the five senses. You then place them into a cauldron one by one, your mother keeping a watchful eye. The ritual comes to an end and the result is a small glowing pendant that will protect you from the dangers of the outside world. “You must promise me never to take the pendant off,” your mother says. The Goodbye ritual is finished, and you leave, knowing you’ll never see your mother or your hometown ever again, all as the prophecy foretold.\nIt’s a fantastic - if sad - start to Season, and gets straight to the heart of the adventure ahead of you. This is a world where prayers, rituals, and prophecies hold great weight, and where you'll be exploring the fragility and fickleness of memory. Underpinning everything is a deeply profound sense of melancholy - and here I was expecting some relaxing two-wheeling through lovely-looking landscapes. Well, turns out Season is a lot more than a pretty travelogue.\nRead more",

          "description": "Thanks to the joys of late code delivery, a few of us are just now getting to grips with talkative Squeenix ARPG Forspoken. While Alice Bee hammers her review together, I’ve been on my usual hardware bullshit, mainly investigating the peculiar system requirements that were released last week. \r\n\n\r\nThese aren’t just an odd collection of specs because of the sheer weight and breadth of their demands; they also overtly target resolutions and framerates that hardly anyone is going to be engaging with. Who on desktop plays at 1280x720? Fewer than 0.3% of Steam users, apparently. And personally, if I’ve spent the cash on a 1440p gaming monitor, I probably wouldn’t be satisfied to watch it display my games at just 30fps. I’ve therefore been finding out what PC hardware Forspoken actually needs to run both smoothly and at more realistic resolutions. Maybe then we can update those system requirements to create some very-much-unofficial, but hopefully more useful, spec guidelines.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I played the pair of Theatrhythm 3DS games to absolute death back in the day, and was hoping that Squeenix's newfound PC love-in would mean I'd be able to write about it non-stop when Theatrhythm Final Bar Line comes out on February 16th. Alas, that joy was immediately curtailed when I saw FBL wasn't, in fact, coming to PC at all, and would remain a Switch and PS4-only game for the foreseeable future. But that's okay, because YouTuber Gloomhonk has created the perfect antidote to my Theatrhythm woes in the form of their brilliant Trombone Champ rendition of FF VII's Those Who Fight Further.

The type of thing that fell very much into the 'touch anything and you're dead' bracket of early adventure games. Getting eaten by sharks, burned to death by a dragon, and the awkward fate of being dragged into space through a shattered mirror were just some of the ways you could cop it on the black and white Apple Macintosh original. Heck, if you lost your torch while exploring, you'd also fall and break your neck within minutes. Happy days! No doubt, then, that you'll be pleased to hear that the original creators are now making a Shadowgate sequel for PC, more than 35 years after its initial release. Beyond Shadowgate is launching a Kickstarter campaign on February 18th, and promises lots more ridiculous ways to pop your clogs. \nRead more",

          "description": "Over the past couple of days, Book Twitter (and actually regular Twitter, because it's such a catastrophically mockable opinion to have in public) have been making much fun of this dude, who essentially pitched that AI could disrupt books. Another guy enthusiastically replied that you could add Metaverse features so you could \"live the book\". Don't bother adding to the pile on, because there are no more jokes to make. They have been deluged by people pointing out that TV, films and video games all aready exist.\nThis made me think about, firstly, that we'd be much better off as a society if techbro web3 enthusiasts were all siloed into one giant Truman Show-esque hamster ball where they can all scurry about together thinking they're achieving things. But secondly, that some people really put a lot of store on interactivity. Including me! Graham was the one who sent me those tweets, and he said he wouldn't want to live in any of the books he's been reading, because everyone in them is sad or angry for the whole book, until almost the end. I said I wouldn't want to be in them because you'd only end up being a side character, and that's boring.\nRead more",

          "description": "Most deckbuilding strategy games see you create a single deck of cards over the course of the game. With every completed stage, you're given the chance to add in new cards and take out old duffers, carefully honing those rough edges until it's your very own death by paper cut machine. Mahokenshi isn't most other deckbuilders, though. Here, you're tasked with creating a fresh deck of cards each time you start a new mission, bolstering your initial crop of starter attacks and movement cards with new, more powerful attacks on the fly as you move around its hex-based landscapes. Some can be found out in the wild, but most of them you'll be buying from village merchants, before upgrading them at dojos dotted around the map. And at the end the mission, they're all swept away. \nIt's certainly a refreshing take on deckbuilding, and it lends itself to even more spontaneous wins and comebacks than the usual frisson of tension you get from simply drawing a good or bad hand. But with main story missions quickly ramping up in difficulty, that scramble for bigger and better cards up front is often Mahokenshi's undoing. The whims of chance are felt more keenly than ever in Game Source Studio's debut deckbuilder, and they never quite felt like they're tipped in your favour.\nRead more",

No, I'm not sure what's going on with the previously announced Headhunter right now either, but in some ways, I'm glad it's Build that's coming out first. \nAfter all, it's been a hot minute since the last SteamWorld game came out, and Build is shaping up to be the perfect reintroduction to what made this series so special. It goes right back to its roots, reframing that classic SteamWorld Dig story of mining for gold and treasure with a new, management-style eye for town-planning, while also paying homage to where it all began for these jolly old rustbuckets way, way back on the Nintendo DSi. That's right. SteamWorld Build may be a citybuilder on the surface, but down below it's a mining and tower defence 'em up - and having lost several hours to my demo build already, it's really something special. \nRead more",

Movie, an adaptation of one of gaming's most beloved and successful franchises of all time — Notably, the clip features up our first opportunity to hear Seth Rogan's performance of the mighty Donkey Kong, one of many familiar faces that will be showing up in the colorful adventure.\nThe clip rolls out with footage we've seen before, as our boy Mario finds himself on the receiving end of a beatdown from the banana-lovin' ape. Looking to the skies to save him, Mario hits a Question Block and bags himself a Cat Suit, as featured in Wii U release Super Mario 3D World. Unfortunately, Mario's solemn \"Meow\" fails to impress Kong, who promptly mocks him before continuing the ass-kicking.\nhttps://twitter.com/supermariomovie/status/1619795800686739456?s=20&t=fwHS1JERA9tBi1kQ8j3riw\nI'd love to think that the \"Meow\" line is a sly dig at the notorious first trailer for Sonic the Hedgehog, but it's probably just a coincidence. Anyway, you can check out Seth Rogan's snippet of dialogue in the tweet embedded above, and you can watch the original trailer in our previous report. Seth Rogan will be joined by and ensemble cast that includes Chris Pratt (Mario), Anya Taylor-Joy (Peach), Keegan Michael-Key (Toad), Jack Black (Bowser), and Charlie Day (Luigi)\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie is scheduled to launch in theaters in the UK and Europe in late-March. It will premiere in North America on April 7. And, you know what? it's really not looking too bad.\nThe post New Super Mario Bros. Movie clip debuts Seth Rogan’s Donkey Kong appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Cutesy platforming legend returns on PS4 and Nintendo Switch\nA real Taito gem has been added to the Arcade Archives this week, as Hamster has re-released the veteran arcade developers' ultra-cute, ultra-challenging platform actioner The NewZealand Story, now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.\nReleased to the arcade market in 1988, before swiftly being ported to a wide variety of home computer and console platforms. The story concerns a charming, dot-eyed kiwi known as Tiki, who is the sole escapee from a flock of his brethren, abducted by a huge, nefarious walrus. Seriously outnumbered and outweighed, Tiki donss his best pair of kicks, grabs his trusty bow-and-arrow, and ventures forth across a highly-stylized \"NewZealand\", determined to rescue his party of pals and the love of his life, Phee-Phee.\nYou can check out the adorable action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Shadowserg.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdyRIX4q0MY&ab_channel=Shadowserg\nWhat follows is some delightfully cartoonish platform action, as Tiki navigates four distinct zones, each containing four stages. At the end of each zone, a huge level guardian awaits, who Tiki must defeat to save a pal and journey into the next sector. It's a wonderful example of the genre, recognized for its fun visuals, infectious music, and cute characters. As playable today as it ever was.\nThe NewZealand Story would be a smash hit in both the arcade and the home markets, selling an amazing amount of copies on platforms such as the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, and Commodore Amiga. Such is the legacy of Taito's '80s hit, our loveable hero Tiki, despite only cameoing in a few titles since, is stillone of gaming's most instantly recognizable characters, even to those yet to experience his iconic adventure.\nThe NewZealand Story is now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nThe post Taito’s beloved The NewZealand Story joins the Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

New reports indicate Ubisoft is working on the next Far Cry, as well as a standalone multiplayer Far Cry spin-off.\nReports first surfaced at Insider Gaming, saying two Far Cry projects are in the works. One is \"presumed to be\" a single-player experience, while the other would be a multiplayer title. Insider Gaming's report claims these titles were originally one project, and were then split into two separate games early in development.\nKotaku corroborates parts of the report. It's also heard that both projects were mentioned in a recent internal Ubisoft update from CEO Yves Guillemot. According to Kotaku's sources, this next Far Cry entry will see the series move from the Dunia engine to Snowdrop, the engine powering The Division 2.\nAccording to Kotaku's sources, Ubisoft has been trying to make a fully multiplayer Far Cry for years. Attempts were then canceled or morphed into other projects. This would be the first time in the series' history that it has completely standalone multiplayer, though, rather than a mode packaged into the mainline Far Cry entry. When contacted for comment by Kotaku about the report, an Ubisoft spokesperson said the company doesn't comment on rumors and speculation.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRMbuyJyUzU\nA Far Cry from its predecessors\nThough a new Far Cry makes complete sense, the multiplayer portion of these reports is interesting. Ubisoft has at least one big live-service game in Rainbow Six: Siege, but Far Cry has usually had multiplayer as a feature, rather than the full focus.\nThe company has seen some rough waters recently though, between recent comments from its CEO and cancelling a good number of games and pushing pirate sim Skull and Bones back again.\nThe post Far Cry 7 and multiplayer Far Cry reportedly in the works at Ubisoft appeared first on Destructoid.",

That said, you can freely grind this raid for higher drop rates of rare items like Ability Patches and Bottle Caps. More importantly, since Greninja will always sport the same moves and Poison Tera-Type, you can repeat a winning strategy as often as your teammates are willing to cooperate. Here’s…",

The latest title from The Evil Within developer Tango Gameworks is an action-rhythm game that blends the two genres expertly. It was practically made in a lab for me, as someone who's very enthusiastic about both rhythm games and Tango Gameworks' transition into action game design. I love its plucky hero, Chai, and his companions (I have a special fondness for 808, the robot cat that turns into the flying ball thing from Mobile Suit Gundam). I'm a huge fan of the game's flashy comic book art and its early-00s soundtrack.\nBut you know what I love more than Hi-Fi Rush's electrifying gameplay? Its humble release.

It pretty much felt like the show was going to get a renewal as soon as we saw the success of the premiere episode, so the writing was on the wall with this one. We haven't gotten any other official info from the announcement so far — we just know Season 2 will be on the way.\nhttps://twitter.com/TheLastofUsHBO/status/1619017515581018112\nAs far as the content of Season 2, we know as per the show's creators that it will be covering the events of The Last of Us Part II, as this first season will come to a close along with the first game's story. One thing to consider is that the sequel is considerably longer than its predecessor — over double the length in terms of hours — so there's a chance that they'll need more than one season to tackle its narrative. In an interview from The Hollywood Reporter, Neil Druckmann revealed that they don't have any plans for the show's story to go beyond the games.\nPersonally, I think my viewing experience of The Last of Us will have to end with Season 1. My curiosity is enough to carry me through as of now, but I don't think I'll have it in me to sit through a whole other season — especially because the story of Part II wasn't my favorite to begin with. As a fan, I'm happy to see the franchise thriving, but I've spent so much time thinking and talking about it, I think it's time to move on for a while after I finish covering Season 1.\nThe post HBO’s The Last of Us has been renewed for a second season appeared first on Destructoid.",

Featuring intensely violent side-scrolling action, Trek to Yomi attempts to capture the balletic carnage and aesthetic violence of the many movies that poured out of Toei Studios between the '60s and '70s\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kexl_PrUeFo&ab_channel=DevolverDigital\nUnfortunately on launch, Trek to Yomi didn't quite receive the smash hit reviews one might have hoped, but it was universally praised for its presentation style, great soundtrack, and fine, if unremarkable gameplay. For fans of the samurai genre, Trek to Yomi is still more than worth picking up, and remains a fine example of a modern-day, Edo-era release — alongside fantastic titles such as FromSoftware's  Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and Sucker Punch's Ghost of Tsushima.\nTrek to Yomi launches January 30 on Nintendo Switch.

As a publisher Skybound currently holds IPs such as The Walking Dead and Escape Academy, while also owning physical distribution rights for titles such as Cuphead, Psychonauts 2, Untitled Goose Game, Gang Beasts, and more recently Striking Distance Studios' The Callisto Protocol.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtpjlXOviKA&ab_channel=SkyboundGames\nPittsburgh-based MegaCat Studios has released several low-key titles in its young life, including games for retro platforms such as the NES and the Sega Mega Drive. WrestleQuest represents the indie outfit's biggest and most promising title to date, blending strategic RPG combat with the Day-Glo, territory-era world of pro wrestling. Alongside a roster of original characters, WrestleQuest will also star real-world grapplers such as The Road Warriors, Sgt. Slaughter,  Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts, Andre the Giant, and Macho Man Randy Savage.\nIt is reported that MegaCat intends to use Skybound's investment to help with the financial side of project development, while also noting that the partnership will give the small studio access to IP and publishing resources.

The story will follow two teenagers, Zoe and Kaito (the former is a character players will recognize from the original Road 96), and will switch between them as their journey challenges \"their friendship and everything they believe in.\"\nMile 0 will also deviate from its predecessor in that it will include playable musical sections, and if that music is anywhere near as catchy as the song playing over the announcement trailer, we'll be in for a treat.

Developer Adglobe and publisher Binary Haze Interactive announced today that Redemption Reapers will launch on February 22, 2023.\nThis tactical approach is a fair bit different from the Metroidvania style of Ender Lilies. Redemption Reapers follows a mercenary group called the Ashen Hawk Brigade, fighting as part of humanity's last stand against the evil Mort army. It's a brigade made up of despised warriors who are nonetheless masters of their craft. And as the commander, the player will try to navigate tactical battles and achieve victory, or fail.\nToday's gameplay overview goes over just how the Ashen Hawk Brigad…",

          "description": "Check out Abzû's chill older brother\nIf you've yet to play Giant Squid's gorgeous action-adventure title The Pathless, now's your chance, because it's finally getting a port to the Nintendo Switch and Xbox next week on February 2. The game is already available to play on pretty much every other platform, including PlayStation, Steam, Epic Games Store, and Apple Arcade. Porting it out to the two remaining major consoles will make The Pathless as widely accessible as it gets, which is a pretty big deal for an indie game.\nhttps://twitter.com/A_i/status/1618655130026393614\nIn the game, the player takes on the role of the Hunter, \"a master archer who travels to a mystical island to dispel a curse of darkness that grips the world.\" There's an emphasis on smooth, acrobatic-like platforming and making slick trick shots alongside an eagle companion who will help you along on your journey. The game even offers some boss fights to add a bit of challenge, but overall, exploring the open world entirely uninhibited will lull you into a soothing flow state in no time.\nGiant Squid is also the developer behind the calming diving game Abzû, and they've managed to further build upon their gameplay systems to create a relaxing yet engaging experience with The Pathless. If you're looking for a short experience to dive into for an evening, The Pathless is a great bet with the average playthrough coming in at around five hours.\nThe post The Pathless is coming to Nintendo Switch and Xbox in February appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The actor for the video game version of Tess in The Last of Us, Annie Wersching, has died. She was 45. \nWersching was diagnosed with cancer in the summer of 2020 and she died following a two-year battle against it yesterday, January 29. She is survived by her husband Stephen and her three children, Freddie, Ozzie, and Archie. A GoFundMe has been created to help raise money for Wersching's family. \nIn the video game industry, Wersching is perhaps best known for her role as Tess in Naughty Dog's 2013 hit, The Last of Us, but she was also known for her roles in 24 and Bosch, as reported by Variety. Many shared their love of Wersching yesterday following the news of her death, including The Last of Us co-creator and director Neil Druckmann. \nI miss my silly friend who helped bring Tess to life. Annie, you left us way too soon. You will forever be part of the TLoU & Naughty Dog family! 💔\nhttps://t.co/3QTnZtBY4B pic.twitter.com/baNHc1wdCT\nJanuary 29, 2023\nWersching was born in St. Louis, Missouri, and Variety reports that her first screen credit happened at 24 years old in a 2002 episode of Star Trek: Enterprise. From there, Wersching appeared in shows like Frasier, Supernatural, and Charmed, before she received recurring roles in General Hospital and 24. She played Tess in The Last of Us in 2013 and was hopefully able to watch Anna Torv's depiction of her character in HBO's The Last of Us over the past two few weeks. \n[Source: Variety]\nThe staff at Game Informer extends their condolences to Wersching's family.",

          "description": "Nintendo and Illumination have released a new teaser that reveals Mario's famous cat suit as well as more of Seth Rogen's Donkey Kong. \nReleased during one of yesterday's big NFL games, this teaser is short and sweet, but it features 10 or so seconds of new footage from The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which hits theaters on April 7. In it, we see Donkey Kong begin to pummel Mario, which is a clip we've seen before, before Mario hits a yellow \"?\" block. This gives him the cat suit powerup and while it's useful in the game, that doesn't appear to be the case here as Rogen's Donkey Kong begins to make fun of the suit and Mario's reliance on it. \nCheck it out for yourself in The Super Mario Bros. Movie clip below: \n\n\nAs you can see, this is the most Donkey Kong dialogue we have heard in a teaser for The Super Mario Bros. Movie yet, and it reveals that Rogen's character is basically just him, complete with his signature laugh, too. This clip is yet another that looks great and we can't wait for this movie to hit theaters in a few months on April 7. \nFor more, check out this trailer from last year that showcases Anya Taylor-Joy's Princess Peach. \nWhat do you think of this new clip?

Today is that long-awaited day, as one of the most beloved and influential games from its era is available now on both platforms. While these versions are both largely faithful recreations of the seminal console FPS, key differences exist in ways that don't immediately surface one as the clearly superior version. I played a decent chunk of both versions to see which one I prefer to play in 2023.\nWhen GoldenEye 007 launched in the late 1990s, I played it obsessively both solo and with friends for months upon months.

Season 1, so far, has been largely viewed as a success by critics and viewers alike. News of a second season isn't surprising because The Last of Us' premiere was the second largest debut for an HBO original series since 2010, and its second episode had the largest audience increase from a first episode to a second episode for an HBO Original drama series in the history of the network. \nCheck out the Season 2 announcement for HBO's The Last of Us below: \nThe journey continues. #TheLastOfUs will return for another season on @HBOMax. pic.twitter.com/FQNG6vhk1d\nJanuary 27, 2023\nAs for what to expect in Season 2, that remains unknown, but considering Season 1 is covering all of The Last of Us Part I, it's likely that the second season will cover at least part of The Last of Us Part II, if not all of it. A release date for Season 2 has not yet been revealed. \nEpisode 3 of HBO's The Last of Us airs this Sunday and is set to feature Bill, played by Nick Offerman. \nWhile waiting for this week's episode, read our interview with game co-creator Neil Druckmann and Joel actor Pedro Pascal about how The Last of Us was changed for TV, and then read about how there are no plans for The Last of Us show to go beyond the games. \nWhat do you think Season 2 of The Last of Us will cover?

          "description": "Today’s Xbox Developer Direct ended with a walkthrough of gameplay from Arkane’s Redfall. In addition to detailing how players will liberate the town of Redfall from its vampiric captors, the team also shared a release date: May 2.\nThe bulk of the presentation showed off how players, either alone or working with up to three other friends, will cleanse Redfall of vampires neighborhood by neighborhood. In addition to gathering intel about the island and completing side quests, such as rescuing human hostages, you’ll capture safehouses. These become additional human HQs, and gaining more brings you closer to battling the area’s ruling vampire underboss. These elite enemies boast unique attacks and require your full might, along with your team’s efforts, to kill for good.\n\n\nWe also got a look at vampire nests. A giant heart fuels these otherworldly dens, and infiltrating one means cutting the heart from the body. Swarms of vampires will try to stop you, of course, but succeeding causes the collapse of a nest, meaning you’ll have to get out fast. Additionally, Arkane showed off the Shroud enemy type, a vampire that can blanket areas in pitch darkness, fire projectiles, as well as phase through floors to evade danger. We also saw a little more of the heroes’ specialized abilities and upgrades, such as granting Layla’s umbrella with a perk that allows it to absorb and fire incoming bullets. \nRedfall will be available on Xbox Series X/S and PC and will be available on Game Pass at launch.",

And if you know anything about the studio's previous games, it's a shocking departure in style, tone, and gameplay. \nHi-Fi Rush is a rhythm action where combat, traversal, and even cutscenes all play to the beat of the game's soundtrack. Aesthetically, Hi-Fi Rush sits somewhere between Insomniac Games' Sunset Overdrive and a Saturday morning cartoon – which is to say, bright, over-the-top, and colorful. A far cry from Tango's other outings, such as The Evil Within series and last year's Ghostwire: Tokyo, which both emphasize horror and the supernatural. \nCheck out the trailer below:\n\n\nHi-Fi Rush is available later today on PC and Xbox consoles via Game Pass. It's directed by John Johanas, who previously directed The Evil Within 2. It features licensed music from Nine Inch Nails, The Black Keys, The Prodigy, and more.",

In addition to new details on PvP, we learned the game is coming to Xbox and PC on April 18, just a few months from now. Like most first-party Xbox titles, it will be available on Game Pass day one. We also got a new gameplay trailer, which you can watch below.\n\n\nIf you're unfamiliar, Minecraft Legends is an action strategy game where players explore a procedurally generated world to find resources, build bases, and save the overworld. In the campaign, which can be played solo or co-op, players work together to stop Piglins from invading their world from the Nether. While traditional Minecraft gameplay has the player placing each individual block, this game allows you to build on a larger scale, placing walls, traps, and turrets. \nIn the PvP mode, two teams of up to four players will face off in a battle to destroy the other team's base. Like the campaign, the world is procedurally generated, so every match is different. Throughout the showcase, developers at Mojang and Blackbird Interactive detailed their favorite strategies, like layering walls with traps in between or exploring the world to find rare mobs. Multiplayer also features cross-platform play and online matchmaking.\nA blog post on the Xbox website also announced that a Deluxe Edition would be available at launch. It includes the base game and a bonus pack of skins.

HBO calls it the \"largest week 2 audience growth for an HBO Original drama series in the history of the network,\" which speaks further to the wide success of The Last of Us. \nWeirdly enough, even though HBO is usually quick to capitalize on series success with an announcement of a second or sequel season, it has not yet done that for The Last of Us, although every sign points to a greenlight for a Season 2. \nEpisode 1 of The Last of Us crossed 10 million viewers after just two days last week and now, Variety reports that it is tracking 18 million, which is nearly four times its premiere night audience. \nWhile waiting for this week's episode, read our interview with game co-creator Neil Druckmann and Joel actor Pedro Pascal about how The Last of Us was changed for TV, and then read about how there are no plans for The Last of Us show to go beyond the games. \n[Source: Variety]\nDid you like Episode 2 more than Episode 1?

The five-part saga sees brothers Sean and Daniel Diaz on the run from the law after the latter’s awakened supernatural power results in the loss of a loved one. \n\n\nThis news also means the entire Life Is Strange franchise will be available on Switch. 2021’s True Colors arrived a few months after its launch, and Life Is Strange: Remastered Collection, which bundles the first title and the Before the Storm prequel, hit the hybrid console last September.\nIn our review, former editor Joe Juba scored Life Is Strange 2 an 8.5 out of 10, writing that \"Life is Strange 2 has been quietly weaving a powerful and sincere narrative experience that admirably carries on the series’ legacy.\" What's your favorite Life Is Strange game?

Horde Mode has existed in World War Z for some time, and tasks players with holding down a single location as waves of zombies invade. Horde Mode XL is functionally the same, but now boosts the number of on-screen enemies to 1,000, which is the most the game has ever managed to showcase at one time. You can check out a short gameplay clip of the new mode above, which skips the first few waves to jump right to the final XL horde.\nHorde Mode XL is coming for free to World War Z tomorrow, January 24, only on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

          "description": "Despite rumors claiming otherwise, 343 Industries will continue to develop Halo games following Halo Infinite. \nMicrosoft laid off 10,000 people last week amidst the company's ongoing $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The same day, Halo Infinite creative director Joseph Staten, who joined the studio in 2020 to help bring the game across the finish line, revealed that he was departing 343 Industries to rejoin Xbox Publishing. Some saw this as a final blow of sorts to Halo Infinite and 343 Industries, but there's no official indication that Halo Infinite's course is changing following these layoffs. \nStill, rumors on the back of a report claimed that 343 Industries would no longer be developing Halo games, as other developers would do that in the future, while the studio served more as an overseer to the franchise. However, 343 Industries studio head Pierre Hintze was quick to get ahead of this rumor and posted the following on Twitter over the weekend: \npic.twitter.com/03Xm3a9s59\nJanuary 21, 2023\nIt's a short and sweet way for Hintze to say that the reporting is false, as are the rumors, and that future mainline Halo games will continue to be developed by 343 Industries, which has developed Halo 4, Halo 5: Guardians, and Halo Infinite. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Halo Infinite review. \nDo you think 343 Industries should continue to develop Halo games?

Developer Infinity Ward has revealed that Hardcore will hit the game during its upcoming Season 2, which begins next month. \nThis news comes just a few days after Infinity Ward revealed some details about this forthcoming season, including the return of Resurgence in Warzone 2.0, Ranked Play, new multiplayer modes, maps, and weapons, and more. Other changes include making the gulag in Warzone 2.0 a 1v1 fight now, instead of 2v2 like it's been since launch, and loot from fallen enemies in Warzone 2.0 will now float on the floor, rather than remain inside a backpack. Many of these changes are welcome, but it's clear the return of Hardcore is the most exciting update coming to Season 2. \nNo HUD? No problem. Hardcore is back!\nJanuary 22, 2023\nInfinity Ward's tweet announcing the news already has more likes – nearly double – than the rest of the tweets that reveal Season 2 information. As for what Hardcore will look like in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, that remains a mystery, but if \"no HUD\" is any indication, it'll be the classic Hardcore mode fans have come to love over multiple Call of Duty titles. For the unitiated, Hardcore mode typically includes no HUD, significantly quicker deaths, and more, making for an all-around more difficult deathmatch-type game mode. \nWhile waiting for Season 2 to begin next month, read Game Informer's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II review.\nWhich Season 2 update are you most excited about?

That means replaying one of the greatest games of the PS1 era, Silent Hill! \nIn 1999, Konami put the fear of fog in a generation of players with the release of Silent Hill. The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights.

It's currently unclear if Project Q was one of those three games canceled (while Project Q was technically announced, it was revealed as an in-the-works project rather than a game with a final title so perhaps Ubisoft considered it unannounced). \nFor more, read about what Project Q was going to be here. \n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]",

That first Scarlet and Violet expansion arrives this March (alongside various changes, including a price increase), but first, we have one more Sword and Shield expansion to get to.\nPokémon Trading Card Game: Sword & Shield – Crown Zenith, out this week, adds more than 160 new cards, including 3 new Radiant Pokémon, five Pokémon VMax cards, eight Pokémon VStar cards, and 70 cards with special Galarian Gallery artwork. The Pokémon Company sent over some of the products in this special expansion, and we cracked them to see what we could pull.\nThough I'm frustrated you can't buy these as individual booster packs (they're only available in larger packs like the Elite Trainer Box and special collections), I absolutely love several of the cards I pulled. In particular, the full-art cards are absolutely striking. I'm very happy with the Radiant Charizard, and the Pikachu and Lucario cards might be among my favorites of those respective Pokémon. You can see the full gallery below.\n\nPokémon Trading Card Game: Sword & Shield – Crown Zenith arrives starting on January 20 with the Elite Trainer Box and Collections starring Regieleki V or Regidrago V. New Tins and Collections will arrive through May. For all things Pokémon Trading Card Game, head to our special hub by clicking the banner below!",

The game received a special edition release with added in content in 2008 with FES, and was then re-released a third time for PSP in 2010 with the most added content, but some modifications made to run on Sony's handheld platform.\nPersona 4 followed – again a mild hit – but then Persona 5 came along and cemented the franchise's reputation as one of the best RPGs ever made. Fans who discovered the series with 5 have wanted to figure out what they've been missing out on, and longtime players have been demanding the re-release of 3 so that a larger audience could play what many call their favorite. After arguably too long, Atlus is finally ready to make that happen with the re-re-re-release of Persona 3 on modern consoles January 19.\nJoin Kyle Hilliard and Wesley LeBlanc as they look at the game's first true dungeon and chat about perhaps the most controversial Persona game in the series.\n\n\nFor more previews of some of the biggest games of 2022 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider, Fire Emblem Engage, Clive 'N' Wrench, Inkulinati, Outer Terror, and more.",
