Created by two-person Hannah and Joseph Games, it casts you as one of the Vollings - a race of gaunt elven humanoids, hailing from the same school of manky action-figure as Judero, who have been shunned by their gods and have accordingly turned to paganism. \r\n\n\r\nSpecifically, you're a lord who has set up a spice farm on a \"cursed\" island, the former home of a long-dead civilization. This certainly sounds like a foolish thing to do, and it's no huge surprise that everybody on your farm has gone missing. So off you trot with a team of four custom-generated companions to solve the mystery, and also make up gnarly spells by daubing your blood on trees.\r\n \nRead more",

A world of social and economic calamity that looks, nonetheless, rather pleasant. I like the art deco retro-future vibe.\nRead more",

I’ve brought an utterly improbable Champions League title to Aston Villa, built an enviable Ultimate Team and developed a formation that keeps at least outright humiliation at bay in online matches… And yet, my heart isn’t bursting with the joy of joga bonito. This must be how Guardiola feels, popping onto the pitch to celebrate his annual Prem title with the latest batch of ruthlessly efficient, lab-grown wonderkids and pushing down the feeling that this one doesn’t feel quite as special as the first.\nThat is to say, EA Sports FC25 is a bit like FC24. Which was quite a lot like FIFAs 21-23, which had a lot in common with the FIFAs our ancient ancestors used to play by the fireside in their primitive tribal dwellings. There are noticeable additions - particularly new tactics controls and a 5v5 Rush mode - and I’m glad they’re here. But as much as they contribute towards a continuously compelling suite of foot-to-ball, they can’t quite dislodge the nagging feeling that this shouldn’t be an annual, full-price release anymore.\nRead more",

In fact, the game’s demo managed to make me go “oooh” then “ah!” in three different ways before I’d even exited the starting elevator. It also made me go “ugh” once, because I opted against tank controls, despite the suggestion to use them with mouse and keyboard. I come to you as disembodied voice, trapped between the worlds of video game inputs, with a dire plea: don’t do that. Just use tank controls. I’d restart but I’m already in too deep.\nRead more",

          "description": "For years, a dangerous and charismatic game has evaded the grasp of many designers. Some say it doesn't exist, that no publisher would ever back it. I'm talking about the one city block RPG that Warren Spector has often mentioned. Sure, we've seen a few usual suspects already - Deus Ex Mankind Divided, Disco Elysium, even Else: Heart.Break - they all grimace in the line-up but nothing ever sticks. Now, out of the gloom of indie development, comes another perp ready to have his mugshot taken. Shadows Of Doubt is an open world detective sim that comes perilously close to being our guy. Its clothes, stature, gait, and fingerprints match the description of what Spector often describes. And yet, if you tilt your head, something is just a little off. The game isn't confined to one block. It's not an RPG precisely. And its simulation has plenty of bugs, jank, and unintentional comedy. But after all this time, in the absence of a smoking gun, shouldn't we just put this guy in the slammer and call the case closed? I say yes, let's. Officers! Arrest this game, it's brilliant. \nRead more",

Yes!\nI’m therefore somewhat unnerved to report that my enthusiasm has been tempered significantly by actually playing it. I’ve since used all the straws I’ve clutched at to spell out \"It’s just a demo\" on my floor, but the fear remains that Crimson Desert’s fantastical open-world exploration is going to be interrupted by regular bouts of twangy, unwieldy, unsatisfying combat.\nRead more",

In the original you controlled the titular Mickey Mouse who, armed with a magical paintbrush (wieldable by waving the Wiimote about), could paint or rub out surfaces to solve puzzles. It was the work of Junction Studios led by Warren Spector, best known for being The Deus Ex Guy. No, sadly Mickey could not nano-augment his brush for better target acquisition, nor project laser-guided anti-tank rockets from his podgy white mitts.\nAnd no, Rebrushed doesn't let him do anything of these either. Clearly a missed opportunity. But is it better nonetheless? With an updated look, some added secrets, more moves for Mickey, and controller/M&K support, I'd say longtime Mickey heads will adore this nostalgia trip. For total newcomers like me, I'd say it's a platformer that's certainly charming and clever and wonderfully experimental, but a bit flat in places too.\nRead more",

You can do that anywhere.”\nA QA tester with Zenimax currently on union leave, Mitchell joined the Communications Workers Of America (CWA) as a full-time organiser after she and her colleagues formed what was, at the time, the biggest union in videogames - ZeniMax Workers United. Now she helps the CWA do what they did for her and her colleagues at Zenimax: provide support, training, resources and guidance for workers in the videogame industry who have decided, for whatever reason, that they want to unionise.\nRead more",

          "description": "The servers for Throne and Liberty are down as of writing as the developers prepare the client for Update 1.1.0.\n\n\nThis is the first major post-launch update, and it's available on PC and consoles. While the update is already available across all platforms, the servers continue to be out of order. Thankfully, NCSoft has already informed a potential timeline regarding when you'll be able to play once again.\n\n\nWhen will the Throne and Liberty servers go live after Update 1.1.0?\n\n\nThe maintenance began as scheduled at 12:30 a.m. PT/3:30 a.m. ET/7:30 a.m. UTC. According to the official notice, it is expected to last approximately six hours. If we assume that NCSoft will stick with that timeline, you can jump into Throne and Liberty at 6:30 a.m. PT/9:30 a.m. ET/1:30 p.m. UTC.\n\n\n\n\nThere's a chance that the maintenance could be extended at short notice. We have seen that happening in the past with games like Lost Ark, so a delay can't be ruled out yet. If there are no such delays, you should be able to play the latest MMO in about four hours since this article went live. If there are any delays, we will update the new timeline in this article.\n\n\nThe latest update includes some major changes across all platforms, much of which are targeted towards making the game a lot more stable. If the changes work as intended, the UI should feel smoother, and some of the errors you might have encountered till now should be resolved.\n\n\nHowever, to test it out, we will have to wait at least a few more hours until NCSoft is done with its maintenance work.\n\nThe post Throne and Liberty Update 1.1.0 maintenance: When will the servers be back? appeared first on Destructoid.",

In Amazon Games' latest adventure, you can play with and against each other. The PvP scene is pretty near despite the early days, but you can simply concentrate on the PvE side of things. It's pretty fun to get together with your buddies to take down the strong bosses, and unlock unique rewards. To ease the process, you can either join a guild, or create one of your own.\n\n\nHow to create a guild in Throne and Liberty\n\n\nWhile the easier job is just to join a guild, you can create one on your own as well.\n\n\n\nGo to the main menu.\n\n\nSelect the Guild option.\n\n\nClick on Create a Guild.\n\n\nChoose your Guild Emblem, and you can also customize its looks.\n\n\nChoose the name for your guild.\n\n\nOnce created, players can search for it and request to join. You can also share the details with your friends so that they can join.\n\n\n\nDo note that you can't immediately create a guild after starting the game. You'll have to reach level 7 in order to make one (or join a guild).\n\n\nHow to join a guild in Throne and Liberty\n\n\nIf you don't want to create a guild, you can simply join one made by another player. As an alternative, you can also join a Party if you simply want to clear content, which is hard to do alone. Once you're level 7 or higher, go to the main menu.\n\n\n\nSelect the Guild function.\n\n\nYou can filter out your results using the available prerequisites.\n\n\nOnce you've found a guild, send a request to join.\n\n\nOnce your request is accepted, you'll be part of the guild.\n\n\n\nApart from joining guilds and parties, Throne and Liberty also has a matchmaking system for certain types of content. To access this feature, you'll need to reach player level 20.\n\nThe post How to create or join a guild in Throne and Liberty appeared first on Destructoid.",

A Magic Judge named Sheldon Menery started to shape this format in the early 2000s around the idea of a social, player-driven philosophy.

          "description": "No matter if you are playing on consoles or PC, nothing will be more handy in Throne and Liberty than the ability to auto run, as doing it will allow you to take a break while still making your way to your destination. \n\n\nBut how exactly can you do that in the game? Here's how to auto run in Throne and Liberty, no matter your platform of choice.\n\n\nHow to Auto Run in Throne and Liberty on both consoles and PC\n\n\nYou can auto run in Throne and Liberty when playing with a controller by opening your Quick Menu —hold L2/LT— and then selecting Move Constantly. PC players using a mouse and keyboard can also trigger the action by simply pressing \"/\". You can also set a keybind to the action on consoles, as well as change the default one on PC by doing the following: \n\n\n\nHow to change your auto run keybind on PC\n\nHead to Settings\n\n\nGo to Shotcuts and then to Character\n\n\nScroll down until you spot Move Constantly\n\n\nClick to reassign your keybind. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to assign an auto run shortcut on consoles (PS5 and Xbox)\n\nHead to Settings\n\n\nOpen the Controller tab and then select Custom under Presets.\n\n\nScroll down until you spot Move Constantly.\n\n\nAssign your desired input/input combination to the action. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nKeep in mind that once auto running, you will be able to direct your character by moving your camera, as well as cancel the action by either performing a movement input or interacting with anything. To make sure you will be able to sharp turns, I recommend adjusting your Camera Sensitively, a feat you can do by heading to Gameplay and then to Camera. \n\n\nNow that you know how to make your travels a little easier, don't forget to also check out how to get the Rare Lithograph in Throne and Liberty.\n\nThe post How to Auto Run in Throne and Liberty appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "11 bit studios revealed today that the sci-fi survival sim has been delayed from its 2024 release window to Q1 2025. According to the team, The Alters needs the extra time to optimize and ensure every aspect of the player's journey as as seamless as possible.\n\n\n\n\nI played through the demo of The Alters in the previous Steam Next Fest and while I enjoy pretty much everything 11 bit creates, The Alters felt special. In fact, it was my favorite demo of the fest and put The Alters up there with my most highly anticipated releases of the year. \n\n\nYou take on the role of Jan Dolski, a space miner who crash lands on a harsh distant planet that is so close to its sun that sunrise on this planet means lethal doses of radiation. But Jan finds a strange resource on the planet called Rapidium that allows him to create alternate versions of himself called Alters.\n\n\nEach version of Jan appears to have lived its own life a different way; one Jan may be a scientist, while another is a doctor. Using these many Jans, the player must create outposts across the planet to gather resources and continue to survive and tech up. But each Jan also has its own emotions and needs. The result makes The Alters part base builder and part The Sims-like management of your Alters. Like 11 bit studios' other series Frostpunk, The Alters is pretty narrative-driven as you progress.\n\n\nI'm all for a brief delay to get a title some extra love as it enters its final stretch, and I'll for sure be picking up The Alters. But I hope others are willing to give it a shot in what is turning out to be a pretty jam-packed Q1 2025 with some big releases like Civilization 7, Assassin's Creed Shadows, Monster Hunter Wilds, and more.\n\n\nThe Alters is now set to release in Q1 2025 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.\n\nThe post Sci-fi survival sim The Alters delayed to Q1 2025 appeared first on Destructoid.",
