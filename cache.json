Unless you go into it knowing what you want to buy ahead of time, the significant slowdown and copious shovelware making up the majority of the ‘Recent Releases’ section will likely be enough to scare you off long before you discover anything worth purchasing.\nThere are a lot of games on the eShop in 2024; far more than we’re comfortable with, frankly. It might be difficult to imagine now, but when the Switch launched in 2017 with little more than Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Fast RMX, Snipperclips, 1-2 Switch, and a handful of other software titles, the eShop actually ran pretty smoothly. This, coupled with its simplistic design, actually made the user experience reasonably pleasant.

          "description": "Coming to Switch in August.\nIt seems like we're in the age of weird, oft-forgotten platforming mascots making a return. We say that because today, Ratalaika Games announced that \"the bat is back!\" No, not that bat — Aero the Acro-Bat. The circus performer will be making his grand return on Switch (and all other consoles) on 2nd August 2024.\nOriginally developed by Iguana Entertainment (later Acclaim Studios Austin) and released on the SNES and Sega Genesis / Mega Drive in 1993, Aero the Acro-Bat stars the titular bat on an adventure to rescue his girlfriend Ariel. Edgar Ektor is trying to ruin the circus — and all amusements as we know it — and our acrobatic bat has to put a stop to his misdeeds. The game also came to GBA in 2002.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Yes, these two series have absolutely nothing in common beyond a shared naming convention and we’re definitely being more than a bit cheeky, but it’s technically a true statement.\nBack in the early ‘90s, Neon Genesis Evangelion anime studio Gainax took its biggest swing in the realm of video games yet with Princess Maker 2, a life-simulator game all about raising a young daughter into maturity. It’s a title that was undeniably niche at the time of its release, both in terms of concept and game genre. However, that limited appeal never stopped it from attracting its own dedicated international following. Even decades prior to its first official worldwide release in 2016 with the remaster Princess Maker 2 Refine, this title was understood to be a bona fide cult classic.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Best not speculate.\nAnyway, Fallout London is a huge effort from modders Team Folon that was recently sabotaged when Bethesda treated Fallout 4 to a next gen update to capitalise on the Amazon TV show's popularity, rendering several mods incompatible and breaking a lot of stuff. Team Folon have now fiddled with the workings and sent a Fallout London build to GOG for QA testing, which suggests that release is imminent. The catch, however, is that you will need to downgrade your copy of Fallout 4 to play the mod, because even with Team Folon's last-minute adjustments, Fallout 4 next gen and Fallout London simply don't get on.\n Read more",

Like the lootbox hawkers of yesteryear, gacha designers understand the appeal and power of a pleasingly animated gizmo, ker-chunking open and fizzing with potential. This poppy visual and sonic language stretches across Hoyo's latest game, from its cinematic moments, to each character's attacks, to the cute bunny mascots that erupt into gatling guns, to the barista's coffee-making ritual and the recipes of the robo-limbed noodle server.

Today's big release, Once Human, at least features a giant schoolbus on monster legs, together with a less exciting but customisable van that just has wheels. In this open world survival shooter, you are a \"Meta-Human\" making your way around a landscape corrupted by Stardust, which has warped the scenery and will slowly drive you nuts. \r\n\n \nRead more",

The publishing giant has reportedly closed Piranha Bytes, the studio known for cult RPGs like Gothic, Risen, and Elex, according to a worker who spoke to Polish games site CD-Action. The studio's existence had been under threat since early this year, after being targeted in Embracer's purgatorial studio massacre. At that time the German studio were hopeful to avoid being closed down, insisting \"don't write us off yet!\" Unfortunately, it looks like those who worked at the studio have since been laid off.\nRead more",

The best-known is probably Frostpunk, with its perpetual raging against the dying of the light, its ceaseless scrape for coal and wood as the temperature falls. Anoxia Station, announced this month, is similarly driven by the gathering of fossil fuels, and similarly shaped by questions of worker death and morale, but it takes you deep underground - into a sumptuous, brutal world of quartz crystals, salt caves, magma lakes, moonmilk rivers, swirling gases and, judging from the below trailer, enormous maggots and centipedes. Larva lakes, amirite.\n Read more",

It has now been occupied by Russia for almost two years, during which, as reported by the Associated Press, Russia has demolished, rebuilt and renamed much of the city, overwriting its Ukrainian heritage.\nThe Disco Elysium-inspired RPG Hollow Home is a memory of Mariupol from just before the war - not a 1:1 recreation, but a collection of details, colours, personalities and some familiar buildings, painstakingly amassed and offered up in the face of erasure. Speaking to me during a very brief demo at Digital Dragons in Poland this year, artist Anastasia Hlyniana called my attention to the plants jutting from old car tyres around the game's isometric map, which she says are a common sight in Mariupol.\n Read more",

The tune you were whistling dies in your throat as you hurry past into the reassuring shadow of the relatively gnomeless bungalows to either side. Gardening sim Horticular is like that, but with an even greater sense of contrast, because it asks you to resettle a desolate planet. There is no generic urban scenery to hurry onto, here.

There's a heap of other fixes and changes but among them lies the admission that something has been missing. \"We fully understand people want a dedicated kick button for all weapons,\" the developers say.

But no seriously, I think no matter if it's a bit Soulsy or not, my key takeaway is one of relief. There's a lot more substance to back up the style than I thought there would be, alongside it feeling a lot more compact than the behemoth I envisioned in my head. All good signs for the complete package, which strikes me as living up to the crushing pressure of its number one Steam Wishlist spot.\nRead more",

The game is one of three freebies Prime Gaming will offer its members; Chivalry 2 and Rise of the Tomb Raider are the two other rewards for Prime members, and all three games will be free to claim via the Epic Games Store from July 16 at 12 a.m. PT until July 18 at 12 a.m. PT.\n\n\n\n\nWhile it is not new for AAA titles to be part of giveaways, it does come across as somewhat surprising to see Warner Bros. already deciding to place the game in a major giveaway. The decision can help bring new players to Suicide Squad, which could be crucial for the game given its player count history and Warner Bros' disappointment. Moreover, the Season 2 content roadmap looks packed, and the sudden surge of new players and steady content might give a new lease of life to the game set in the Arkhamverse.\n\n\nPrime Gaming has been on a roll since June, giving away a handful of titles so far. The following games received staggered launches, leading up to the reveal of the main Prime Day game launches, and include the likes of heavy hitters such as Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge. These games can still be claimed on Prime Gaming: \n\n\n\nDeceive Inc.\n\n\nTearstone: Thieves of the Heart\n\n\nThe Invisible Hand\n\n\nCall of Juarez\n\n\nForager\n\n\nCard Shark\n\n\nHeaven Dust 2\n\n\nSoulstice\n\n\nWall World\n\n\nCall of Juarez: Bound in Blood\n\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge\n\n\nStar Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II\n\n\nAlex Kidd in Miracle World DX\n\n\nSamurai Bringer\n\n\nThe post Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is one of Amazon’s Prime Day freebies appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Vesgitial Organ is a rocket launcher in The First Descendant that has matched the likes of other popular weapons like the Tamer. It’ll work exceptionally well for bossing and mobbing, though you will go through its ammo rather quickly.\n\n\nHow to get the Vestigial Organ in The First Descendant\n\n\nTo get the Vestigial Organ in The First Descendant, you have to play the Miragestone: Vulgus Strategic Outpost Zone Recon Mission in the Agna Desert region. It has a 50% chance to be given to you upon completing the mission. \n\n\nThis mission isn’t always readily available, so make sure the mission timer hasn’t started yet. Be there within five minutes before the event starts. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nBest Vesgitial Organ farm\n\n\nThe best way to farm the Vestigial Organ is to repeat this mission or, after completing it, kill mobs of enemies in hopes that it’ll drop. Luckily, you can visit this mission once you get to Hard mode and it’ll be a higher level than 50. \n\n\nYou can hold onto the weapon until you can start getting level 100 gear. It’ll be easier that way so you can use Weapon Level Transmission to not have to farm for a new one. Though, with steep resource costs, it’s better to just farm a fresh one once you’re at that level.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nBest rolls for the Vesgitial Organ in The First Descendant\n\n\nThe following are the best rolls to have for your Vestigial Organ. You can either find one with these rolls or use the Weapon Readjustment feature at the Workbench. \n\n\n\nExplosive ATK\n\n\nElemental ATK\n\n\nWeapon Change Speed\n\n\nAttribute Status Effect Trigger Rate\n\n\n\nThe Vestigial Organ does not have a good critical hit rate or damage, so it’s pointless to roll for that or apply mods that increase it. With raw damage and increased elemental stats, this launcher will then be good to be an all-rounder weapon. \n\nThe post How to get and farm the Vestigial Organ in The First Descendant appeared first on Destructoid.",

Spiders and publisher Nacon revealed a new release date announcement trailer, featuring the Early Access release date amid cinematic glimpses.\n\n\nThe developers are planning to reveal more information in August via a new gameplay video, which will show more about what players can expect from GreedFall 2 early access. The early access roadmap was already shown by the developers in March 2024, which gives fans a rough idea about what GreedFall 2 will offer at the start.\n\n\n\n\nPlayers will get to experience the first chapters of the main quest in GreedFall 2 during the Steam early access on PC. Moreover, players will get to explore locations such as Teer Fradee, Thynia and Uxantis. There will also be some companions available during the early access period. As for future updates during early access, Spider plans on adding new regions, companions, local and main quests, skills, customization, and more.\n\n\nSpeaking about GreedFall 2 overall, the developers have said that the sequel will be “completely new and bigger” with more regions, enemies, quests, characters, skills and more. The developers have said that they decided to opt for early access so that they can receive feedback from fans and provide a more polished game with improvements to combat and exploration. The first game received a fairly mixed reception at launch, so the decision to open up the game for feedback right from the start can be a welcoming start for GreedFall 2's journey.\n\n\nGreedFall 2 is coming to PC via Steam first, but it will eventually also be released on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.\n\nThe post GreedFall 2 will enter Early Access on Steam in September appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Riot Games has apparently cancelled an in-development platform fighter called Pool Party. A report from Mikhail Klimentov (ReaderGrev) claims that Pool Party would have had gameplay similar to Nintendo's Smash Bros., set in the League of Legends universe.\n\n\nThere were around 70-80 developers working on the game before Riot Games sunsetted its development. It's also suggested that Riot Games was working on a platform fighter because they saw potential in building an esports landscape around it.\n\n\nJoe Hixson, senior communications director at Riot Games, responded in a statement to Klimentov, saying that Riot Games always has a number of projects in “various phases of R&D, and spinning projects up and down happens multiple times a year.”\n\n\nThe report also alleges Riot executives were “spooked” after the perceived failure of Multiversus, a crossover IP platform-fighting game from Warner Bros. Though Pool Party was originally envisioned as a \"hardcore fighting game,\" it went through several revisions, including the addition of party game elements and gameplay mechanics which are “casual-friendly”. It has also been claimed that the fundamental changes to the scope and vision of Pool Party left some of the staff frustrated.\n\n\nThe report has also claims that Riot Games offered half of the team working on Pool Party to be reassigned to a different project within the studio, and other developers were looking for new positions within the company. According to Klimentov's source, 10 have still not received an offer nor were part of the internal application process, which could imply they've left the company.\n\n\nNone of this has affected 2XKO however, Riot's publicly announced fighting game. The company is preparing to debut a new demo at Evo 2024, and plans are in motion for a 2025 launch.\n\nThe post Riot reportedly scraps Smash Bros-style prototype set in League of Legends’ universe appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Weekly Challenges often feature objectives involving 'Akimbo Kills,' which necessitate close-quarters combat. However, to achieve this, you need to use a specific gun. This guide is here to help you navigate this, providing a list of all weapons capable of Akimbo Kills in MW3.\n\n\nWhich weapons have Akimbo Kills in Modern Warfare 3?\n\n\nAkimbo weapons allow Operators to wield two weapons in their hands without using ADS. To get Akimbo Kills in Modern Warfare 3, you must customize your weapon in the Gunsmith with the build. Here's a complete list of guns that can be used for this task:\n\n\n\nBasilisk\n\n\nRenetti\n\n\nCOR-45\n\n\nTYR\n\n\nWSP Stinger\n\n\nP890\n\n\n.50 GS\n\n\nX12\n\n\nFTAC Siege\n\n\nGS Magna\n\n\n9MM Daemon\n\n\nX13 Auto\n\n\nWSP Swarm\n\n\n\nYou may have noticed that the Akimbo Kills weapons are mostly tied to the Handguns collection. Equip the suitable materials by going to the Rear Grip section in the Gunsmith, showcasing an option for the Akimbo.\n\n\nThe WSP Swarm SMG is the only weapon not a part of the Handguns class. For this, go to the Conversion Kit instead and place the WSP Akimbo Brace Stock. Other weapons, such as the Akimbo Shotgun, could work but may not register for the Akimbo Kills objective.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nIf you are trying to complete a Weekly Challenge in Modern Warfare 3, you'll likely need to use a Recommended Akimbo-based weapon. These guns will be marked with a fire symbol in the collection. This requirement will sometimes limit your choices, depending on the current season's Recommended guns.\n\n\nThe Akimbo builds will also be locked behind a particular task. For example, the Akimbo FTAC Siege will only be available after you complete two Daily Challenges. Due to the gun's limited range, it's best to use it in small-sized maps like Shipment, Emergency, and Stash House. You can also utilize it in Zombies mode for an extra challenge.\n\nThe post All weapons with Akimbo Kills in MW3 appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, it may be linked to a rabbithole event, a mechanic where the in-game camera doesn't follow Sims. The hotel itself may not be customizable, but at least the feature has finally been put in Sims 4. It also seems much more accessible than getting a vacation rental since you can come and go as you please.\n\n\nThe arrival of hotels could lead to a game pack that further explores this building type. I've always dreamed about running a bed-and-breakfast, or maybe even a Suite Life of Zack and Cody-inspired hotel in the Sims world. Maxis Studios already has the basis to make this work, considering that you can be a landlord in the For Rent expansion pack. All it needs now is a hotel system, setting up a few rooms for Sims to stay in temporarily. Additionally, the studio could utilize the employee customization from the Get to Work EP for receptionists, housekeeping, and management. \n\n\nWhile a complete overhaul of hotel features may not be on the horizon just yet, we can wait and see what the Lovestruck EP has in store. The Gameplay trailer did reveal plenty of other content to look forward to, from Cupid's Corner dating app to attraction preferences. There are a few pre-order bonuses, too, to gather more unique items for your collection. \n\nThe post Sims 4 Lovestruck Gameplay trailer reveals a new long-awaited feature appeared first on Destructoid.",

It arrives by way of developer Yuke's, which worked on Rumble Roses, as well as a bunch of WWE games up to 2018's WWE 2K19, among other titles. Now an official website and Steam page are live for the brawler, which is flexing with all its might for a 2025 launch on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. \n\n\nPublisher Arc System Works delivered the first look at the new entry in the teaser trailer below. \n\n\n\n\nIf your first thoughts when a new Double Dragon game is announced go straight to Abobo, don't worry; he's here, even if his head isn't roughly the same size as his torso anymore. Abobo isn't the only musclebound monstrosity gunning for the Lee brothers. Revive promises that good ol' Bimmy and Jimmy will get to face off against \"a variety of powerful foes from their past.\" From the looks of it, the latest entry has retained a sense of humor, so we'll see how many of those classic enemies end up making a revamped appearance. \n\n\nScreenshot via Arc System Works\n\n\nDouble Dragon Revive is looking to bring new players into the mix with simple controls and a more modern balance, while also being \"more than a simple button-masher.\" Hey, just try and stop me from mashing buttons!\n\n\nThe announcement mentions that the staff involved have experience working on Arc System Works fighting games, so maybe the combat will go a bit deeper than some other entries. All I need to know is that I can pick up weapons and kick people into refrigerators and dumpsters. More often than not, it's the simple things that keep us going.\n\nThe post Double Dragon Revive modernizes the classic series in first teaser appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "As you complete weekly quests in Fortnite, you'll find a mix of season-specific challenges and general tasks such as traveling in cars, dealing damage with particular weapons, or collecting ammo. A surprisingly difficult task you'll find is sliding across a vehicle, which, although sounds easy, is much harder to pull off successfully than you'd initially expect.\n\n\nHow to slide across a vehicle in Fortnite\n\n\nSliding across a vehicle requires precise movements involving sprinting toward a car, jumping, and sliding across its surface. The easiest way to do this is to find a Whiplash sports car during your match, stand behind it, and get a running start before jumping onto the vehicle. From here, hold CTRL on PC or the right analog stick as you land on the car to slide forward.\n\n\nIt's easier to start from the back and jump forward. Screenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nSince this is a very specific movement, you may have to repeat it a few times to get the timing right. Your goal is to jump in a way that you land on the back of the car so that, once you slide forward, you'll go right along the entire surface. Landing closer to the front won't count toward the weekly quest, even if you pull off the slide successfully.\n\n\nAnother challenge is ensuring no other players are nearby as you're doing this. A good rule of thumb is to avoid popular landmarks or bosses as you attempt this quest, as other people usually crowd around these spots. Unnamed locations or small gas stations are the way to go, as these often spawn a car or two and have few people visiting them until later in the match. If you do see anyone, quickly pick up a weapon and eliminate them from the match before attempting the slide again.\n\nThe post How to slide across a vehicle in Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 3 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Reliable leaker HypeX said on Twitter that a melee-only limited-time mode is in the works. The leaker also revealed a list of melee items and weapons that might be featured in the limited-time mode.\n\n\n\n\nHere are all the possible items that would be available in the melee-only Fortnite LTM:\n\n\n\nShockwaves and heals\n\n\nGrapple Blade\n\n\nSideways Scythe\n\n\nShockwave Hammer\n\n\nNitro Fists\n\n\nChains of Hades\n\n\nKinetic Blade\n\n\nMagneto Mythic\n\n\n\nA melee-only Fortnite limited-time mode would feature players dropping onto the Battle Royale Island without guns, rockets, or any other form of projectile weapons.

Fights in the battle royale can stretch out for quite some time with no projectile weapons in play, and we all know how quickly platforms can be built to avoid fights.\n\n\nWe'll see if this leak fully pans out, but it could be quite an interesting turn of events, if and when Epic fully confirms it.\n\nThe post Fortnite will reportedly introduce a melee-only limited-time game mode later this season appeared first on Destructoid.",

The following nine Modules should do just that:\n\n\n\nReload Insight\n\n\nRecycling Genius\n\n\nExpand Weapon Charge\n\n\nFire Rate UP\n\n\nMaximize Weight Balance\n\n\nVibration Absorption\n\n\nHawk-Eye\n\n\nWeak Point Insight\n\n\nBetter Insight\n\n\n\nThe first five mods are designed with the core purpose in mind. We're adding in fire rate, rounds per magazine, and reload speed so you're dumping a clip into whatever enemy you see. The other four mods lift the weapon in other ways, with Vibration Absorption and Hawk-Eye providing some utility through recoil and accuracy. Weak Point Insight and Better Insight giving weak point damage and critical hit chance respectively.\n\n\nWho is the best Descendant to pair the Thunder Cage with?\n\n\nWith the right build, Bunny is the best character by far to run the Thunder Cage with. If you're building out Bunny properly, you're adding in electricity damage somewhere since all of her builds are electricity-based. This can help the Thunder Cage's unique passive of making enemies explode into electric bursts. It's a match made in heaven.\n\nThe post Best Thunder Cage build in The First Descendant appeared first on Destructoid.",

It was only last year that we played Double Dragon Gaiden, a pixelated throwback brawler (or belt-scroll action game, per its official YouTube description) take on the franchise.\nThis next entry is decidedly more modern, with fully 3D visuals. It's not the first time the series has explored this dimension, but it is a rare occurrence. The game is being developed by Yuke's, the developer that worked on the WWE 2K franchise until 2K19 and most recently developed AEW: Fight Forever. It is being published, or presented by, as the trailer implies, Arc System Works, the developer behind Guilty Gear and Dragon Ball FighterZ.\nDouble Dragon Revive is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and One, and PC sometime in 2025.\n\n\nFor a whole lot more on Double Dragon, but maybe not the version of Double Dragon you're thinking, head here to read all about the 1994 movie. Back in 2019, I tracked down the film's director, James Yukich, to talk about the bizarre film's trajectory, what went wrong, and what he would have done differently had he been giving a chance to try making the film again.",

And later this year, there will be a handful of price increases for various tiers. Here's the exact text as it is presented on Microsoft's website.\nStarting July 10, 2024, the following updates to Xbox Game Pass will take effect:\n    Price changes will go into effect for new members for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, Xbox Game Pass Core, and PC Game Pass.\n    Game Pass for Console will no longer be available for new members.\n    Members who are already subscribed to Game Pass for Console and have automatic payment renewal enabled will be able to continue to enjoy their membership.\nAlso, a new Game Pass option, Xbox Game Pass Standard, will become available in the coming months. These changes will enable us to bring members more value and more great games to Game Pass.\nThe new Xbox Game Pass Standard tier for new members will be $15 a month and will not include access to Day One releases, EA Play, Game Pass for PC, and cloud gaming.\nXbox Game Pass Ultimate, which includes access to all the bonuses now not included in the Standard tier is increasing its price from $17 a month to $20.\nXbox Game Pass Core, which offers online access and a much smaller library of curated games, is changing its yearly from $60 to $75. The $10 monthly price for that tier, however, will remain unchanged.\nPC Game Pass is increasing from $10 per month to $12, but that tier will still include Day One releases.\nAll of these price changes will be reflected starting on September 12.\nPrice changes for services you already pay for are always frustrating. What do you think of the change? Do you plan on maintaining your subscription? Or is it time to cancel?",

This action grants an opportunity to follow up with an attack on the spot while simultaneously adding to RE4’s original close-quarter smackdown.\nAdapting this to the PlayStation VR2 wasn’t easy.

Owners of these games will still be able to play their single-player content, but online support for these titles will end on November 7. The embedded announcement post on X also includes a link to an FAQ to answer additional questions about the sunsetting process. \nhttps://t.co/2W8dLlGjBM\nJune 28, 2024\nWhile the digital PS3/Xbox 360 versions of these games are going away, Battlefield 3 will still be available to purchase on PC. The same is true for Battlefield 4 and Hardline, and these two titles will also remain on sale for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The PC/PS4/Xbox One versions will remain unaffected by today’s updates.\nIt never feels good to see games get removed from sale like this. The reason likely has to do with EA sunsetting online support; it wouldn't be right to continue selling games with popular online modes if that component doesn't work anymore. For those still logging into Battlefield matches on PS3 and 360, you've got a few more months to enjoy the ride.\nFor more on Battlefield, you can learn about how the next entry is shaping up (which is being made with help by Dead Space remake developer Motive Studios) here.",

It seemingly begins on Day One, when the aliens, which possess incredible hearing that requires people to remain silent to survive, attack Earth. It then jumps ahead to Day 105, with Alex, an asthmatic college student trying to survive the end of the world with her boyfriend Martin, on the hunt for supplies and more. \nCheck it out for yourself in the story trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead below: \n\n\nAs you can see, it seems Alex might be pregnant, which, if you've seen the first A Quiet Place movie, can make trying to remain silent in this world quite difficult.

And while I listened to “Magnetic” by K-Pop group ILLIT more times than I’ll admit (when in Korea, right?) through headphones on these trains and buses, I spent much of my time observing how others spent time waiting for their stop.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, everyone is glued to their phones, myself included.

          "description": "Throughout my visit to BioWare's Edmonton office for Game Informer's current cover story about Dragon Age: The Veilguard, game director Corinne Busche reiterates that the studio designed the game with inclusivity in mind. That's extremely evident in the character creator, where players begin their journey in Veilguard. It's easily the best character creator in series history and possibly the most robust I've ever seen in a video game. From hundreds of sliders and options to customize your player-controlled Rook to the ability to pick pronouns separate from gender and more, this character creator speaks directly to the inclusivity of Veilguard – read about my in-depth look at the character creator here. \nBut that feeling doesn't end in the character creator.

Set two months after the events of Ocarina, Link finds himself transported to an alternate version of Hyrule called Termina and must prevent a very angry moon from crashing into the Earth over the course of three constantly repeating days.

Instead of competing with Life Is Strange, a series that Don't Nod created with the first Life Is Strange and continued with Life Is Strange 2 before Double Exposure developer Deck Nine took over with 2017's Before the Storm and 2021's True Colors, the studio decided to push to 2025. \nWe've made the decision to move the release dates of Lost Records: Bloom & Rage to early 2025. We know you're all excited for both Lost Records and the new Life is Strange game, and we wanted to ensure both have adequate space to shine. The wait will be worth it! pic.twitter.com/PH1O7z3uUy\nJune 28, 2024\nLife Is Strange: Double Exposure launches October 29, and now, Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, which will be released in two parts, will launch sometime early next year.

Despite my expectations, I was not prepared for how robust it actually is in Veilguard. Robust enough, even, that BioWare used it to create most of the NPCs in the game, save for mainline characters like companions. Setting hyperbole aside, it is a staggeringly rich creation system, and I look forward to seeing player-created near-replicas of celebrities and monstrous creations that'd be more at home in a horror game. \nBut I'm also looking forward to the community's reaction to the Dragon Age series' best character creator yet.

Originally slated to launch next month on July 25, the upcoming narrative-driven city-builder is now arriving on September 20.\nDeveloper 11 Bit Studios sates that following a recent beta, the team wants to take extra time addressing feedback to ensure the best possible experience. In a press release, design director Jakub Stokalski and art director Lukasz Juszczyk issued the following statement:\n“Based on the surveys we received after playing Beta, the average rating you gave us was 8 out of 10. We’re super grateful for that! At the same time, it was only a small slice of a work-in-progress, still-growing game. While our backlog is plentiful, it was an opportunity for us to listen to what you enjoyed, and what didn’t quite land yet”. \n“This allowed us to prioritise things better, and bring upfront the features and modifications we were already working on. But we also realised that to guarantee the best possible experience on launch, we need more time to finish the development of Frostpunk 2. That’s why we made the difficult decision to postpone its release to September 20th, 2024”.\n11 Bit States that it plans to work on new additions to existing game mechanics and improve the UI and UX, among other things. \nFrostpunk 2 will launch first for PC on September 20. PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions are planned to arrive later. We recently played the game, and you can read our extensive preview here.",

More specifically, it hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam) on August 1, and it brings with it updated visuals and controls and a new skin that harkens back to the original game's most infamous easter egg. \nIn the reveal trailer, we get a look at the graphical improvements Aspyr has implemented in Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, but the game still retains that 2002 PlayStation 2 and GameCube charm. This re-release follows a limited PlayStation 4 physical run that launched back in 2019. \nCheck out the Star Wars: Bounty Hunter announcement trailer below: \n\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, you play as Jango Fett throughout the story, which itself is a prequel to Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. \nIn the original game, there was an easter egg message that said, \"Cash in all bounties to play as Boba.\" However, cashing in all bounties did not let you play as Boba. To make good on that original promise from 2002, Aspyr media has included a Boba Fett skin in Star Wars: Bounty Hunters you can use after completing the game's campaign. \nStar Wars: Bounty Hunter hits PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on August 1. \nWhile waiting for its launch, check out this lengthy gameplay demo of Star Wars Outlaws, another mercenary-centric Star Wars game launching this year.

Though the once previously Xbox-exclusive game has since made its way to PlayStation and PC platforms, it remains unclear which platforms this remaster is coming to. And there's no word on when to expect the remaster either. \nRevealed with a short 47-second teaser trailer, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster looks great, almost more like a remake than a remaster. It's unclear if this is a remaster of the original 2006 game or the HD version of Dead Rising that launched on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC back in 2017. Regardless, we're stoked to head back into a zombie-infested mall with journalist Frank West whenever this remaster launches. \nCheck out the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster teaser trailer for yourself below: \n\n\n\nAre you excited for Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster?

If its first trailer,  which was revealed by IGN today, is any indication, farming/townbuilding sim fans will want to keep an eye on the game. \nThe reveal trailer gives us a great look at what to expect, which includes ranching, treasure hunting, mining, farming, and, of course, romancing. The game is coming to PC sometime in the future, but there's no release date or window in sight. Cattle Country's Steam listing simply says the release date is \"to be announced.\" \nCheck out the Cattle Country reveal trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you might be able to hear, the Cattle Country reveal trailer is narrated by Red Dead Redemption 2's Arthur Morgan, or rather, Arthur Morgan's voice actor, Roger Clark. \n\"Cattle Country straddles the saddle of cozy wholesome gaming and action-adventure,\" the game's Steam listing reads. \"Serving up hours of the slice-of-life you'd expect on the frontier – including mining, fishing, crafting, and farming – along with deep-rooted Wild West quests delivering stories of romance, cattle drives, bandits, and robberies.\"\nHere are some Cattle Country screenshots: \n\nWhile waiting to learn more about Cattle Country, read Game Informer's Stardew Valley review, and then read about Stardew Valley developer ConcernedApe's next simulation game, Haunted Chocolatier. \nWhat do you think of Cattle Country's reveal?

          "description": "The one and only Elden Ring expansion we're getting, Shadow of the Erdtree, launched last week and thousands of Tarnished went to the shadow realm to take on dozens of new enemies, bosses, and more. Now, just a few days later, developer From Software has released a new patch for the game that should make Shadow of the Erdtree a bit easier. \nNow live, Calibration Update 1.12.2 targets the scaling of the attack and damage negation given to players with each Shadow Realm Blessing upgrade. Here's what's changed: \nThe attack and damage negation has been increased for the first half of the maximum amount of Blessing enhancements, and the second half will now be more gradual. \nThe attack and damage negation granted by the final level of Blessing enhancements has been slightly increased. \n\n\nThis patch should apply automatically like any other Elden Ring update but if it doesn't – the Calibration Version listed at the bottom right reads \"1.12.2\" if it has – select \"LOGIN\" and that will apply the latest version of the game. \nThe only other thing this update contains is word from From Software on a confirmed bug where the raytracing settings of Shadow of the Erdtree are automatically enabled (if you've previously loaded save data from previous game versions), which is causing framerate issues for some players. If you're encountering said issues, check to see if you have raytracing on or off in the game's system graphical settings. \nThis patch arrives after one that hit the game last week, which added new hairtsyles, inventory features, balance adjustments, and more to Elden Ring ahead of Shadow of the Erdtree's launch. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review, and then check out this interview where From Software's Hidetaka Miyazaki discusses his approach to difficulty in games. \nWhat do you think of this update?

No, it’s not the key on your keyboard. Rather, it’s a detective story set on a distant planet. Important data has been stolen, and the perpetrator is a shape-shifter laying low in a spaceport dive bar until he can flee off-planet. You play a hard-boiled detective who has the skill to psychically visit bar patrons’ memories to gather clues and narrow down suspects.\nThis is thanks to the kind people at ZOOM Platform, who provided us with the original game sources to work with. Help us test the game by grabbing a daily build. Read through our testing guidelines. The game features a lot of options to chat around with bar patrons’ and do various actions in the different flashbacks. So we really need people to spend time experimenting and make sure everything works correctly. And please take some screenshots along the way.\nIf you don’t own The Space Bar, you can try one of the free demos or purchase it digitally from the ZOOM Platform. Testing is also available on Steam via a beta branch, check the Steam announcement for more details.\nNow, good luck, and fingers crossed you can find the perp. Otherwise, your bureau chief will have you getting up close and personal with toilet duties for the rest of your career. Oh, and PS: The viewpoints of different aliens differ. For the Bartender, who has segmented eyes, even the original developers felt it was difficult and left in a cheat key of ScrollLock to switch back to a single viewpoint. Feel free to use it if, at any point, the flashback becomes too much for you :)\n>",
