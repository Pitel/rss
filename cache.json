          "description": "It's Frogger, but emotional.\nThough 3D platformers often go down the collectathon route to varying success, it can be interesting to see new entries in the genre try something a little different. SCHiM is one such fresh title, eschewing a focus on cartoonish characters, wacky levels, and mountains of things to grab in favor of a semi-narratively driven adventure that just offers a beautiful, artful experience. SCHiM may not be the kind of game that’s ‘fun’ in the way that most other platformers are, but it’ll stick out as a memorable bright spot when you think back through the new releases you tried out this year.\nSCHiM’s story is told through a series of pantomimed cutscenes, leaving a lot of room for interpretation. You begin by playing as a shadow frog quietly following the adventures of a young boy enjoying his childhood, and you're right there with him as he rapidly grows up and experiences the various joys and hardships of life. After the poor dude gets dumped and loses his job in a round of layoffs, you're suddenly separated from him, leaving the young man without a shadow. Thus begins your long journey across the shadows of the world to make your way back to him.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

So it's only natural, then, that the fighters will want to use their downtime to relax a bit, put their feet up, or perhaps even play a bit of basketball.\nThat's exactly what Sephiroth and Kirby get up to in a charming and hilarious stop-motion animation posted to social media by @shinohara_kenta (thanks, Automaton). It's a rather short piece, but it's one of the most effortlessly funny pieces of animation we've seen in quite some time.

Beware slight spoilers for Alan Wake 2 in the passages ahead.\n\r\nDeep in the Dark Place of Alan Wake 2 there is a forest that is not a forest - a zig-zag tunnel adorned with murals of a grisly woodland scene. Entering that tunnel, you find yourself sealed in at either end. But the mural suggests a way out: it changes when you turn around, following an unspoken narrative. It's a device as delicate as the graffiti elsewhere in the Dark Place is obnoxious. In hindsight, it feels like an example of \"metsänpeitto\", a concept from Finnish folklore about forests which, as writer Sinikka Annala explains, saturates the design of Alan Wake 2. It's a fascinating idea I'd love certain much larger, less intriguing video game worlds to learn from.\r\n\n \nRead more",

He shouldn't have felt safe in a room next to the Queen, a woman described as \"reckless\" in her character traits, and who is perilously close to having a nervous breakdown. This, my holy friend, is how your bed chamber becomes a raging inferno. \nBy the end of my first game of Norland, the village of Nandos (you can name your own settlements) is covered in more blood than the back end of the bard's best work. In storytelling terms, it is a tragedy. In terms of fantasy management games? It is great fun. The failure cascade as waterslide. \nRead more",

It’s an action RPG that made me pine for the outdoors and want to be whisked away from all my responsibilities and just exist for a bit. Each time I would finish playing I’d be thinking about my next getaway, and although dungeon delving wouldn’t be on my holiday itinerary Dungeons of Hinterberg is making me think twice. \nRead more",

I have never been to war, but I do own several shovels, and let me tell you, if I ever hear artillery fire or even just dangerously raised voices round these parts, the first thing I will do is tunnel straight down.\nFuck it, I might do that if I read any negative comments on this news piece.

Evidently, players did not sufficiently meet their demand for wanton Orc-massacring, for Robot were forced to release two sequels, which I personally would have titled Orcs Must Die!! and Orcs Must Die!!! or perhaps Orcs Must Die!!?, to indicate a mounting existential crisis.\nNow, Robot have stepped things up by announcing Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap, a newly roguelite, four-player spin on the goblin-farming formula, whose subheading throws bumbling Orc murderers a bone by specifying that you might try building a trap of some kind, a deathtrap possibly.

They lend vigour to a branching, faux-Napoleonic world that might otherwise be a collection of atmospheric strolls between bonfire-equivalents and fights defined by taut resourcing systems. They're idiot-proof grappling points from which you can launch yourself at another triangle, a ledgeful of upgrade materials, or a loitering musketeer who is in urgent need of a ground-pound. \r\n \nRead more",

A slime, in most games, is a squashy smiley face. Why, I could grow myself one of those right this very instant, by doodling a circle in MS Paint and squinting very hard. Slimes do take more complex forms - chrome slimes, fire slimes, slimes with angry eyebrows, etc - but come now, it's not on the same level as rebooting Lara Croft's hair to billow in the blowback from grenades.\nThe simplicity of slime creation may soon become a distant memory, however, for Epic Games tech artist and current Duck Shake Games Asher Zhu is hell-bent on reinventing the homely Dragon Quest sludgeball as a technical tour de force on par with his previous contributions to Unreal Engine showcase Matrix Awakens. That's the impression I garner from the below video of Zhu's latest project, anyway, whose description also tantalises with talk of \"Splatoon mechanics in dungeons\".\n Read more",

What ensues is a charming puzzler of both freedom and flow, which genuinely has you view everyday environments through the googly eyes of a phantom amphibian.

          "description": "We haven't written nearly enough about Fallout London, a gargantuan Fallout 4 total conversion that takes place in a whole new map based on England's capital city - the Big Smoke and/or Great Wen, whose real-life incarnation probably harbours at least one nuke at any given moment, though I haven't asked the King about that lately. Best not speculate.\nAnyway, Fallout London is a huge effort from modders Team Folon that was recently sabotaged when Bethesda treated Fallout 4 to a next gen update to capitalise on the Amazon TV show's popularity, rendering several mods incompatible and breaking a lot of stuff. Team Folon have now fiddled with the workings and sent a Fallout London build to GOG for QA testing, which suggests that release is imminent. The catch, however, is that you will need to downgrade your copy of Fallout 4 to play the mod, because even with Team Folon's last-minute adjustments, Fallout 4 next gen and Fallout London simply don't get on.\n Read more",

Zenless Zone Zero is a game deeply informed by the philosophy of juice. Like the lootbox hawkers of yesteryear, gacha designers understand the appeal and power of a pleasingly animated gizmo, ker-chunking open and fizzing with potential. This poppy visual and sonic language stretches across Hoyo's latest game, from its cinematic moments, to each character's attacks, to the cute bunny mascots that erupt into gatling guns, to the barista's coffee-making ritual and the recipes of the robo-limbed noodle server. The menu screens, the maps, the free-to-play storefront, everything. It is all very juicy. It is pumped with juice, but only in the same way supermarket chicken is pumped with water. \nRead more",

The best-known is probably Frostpunk, with its perpetual raging against the dying of the light, its ceaseless scrape for coal and wood as the temperature falls. Anoxia Station, announced this month, is similarly driven by the gathering of fossil fuels, and similarly shaped by questions of worker death and morale, but it takes you deep underground - into a sumptuous, brutal world of quartz crystals, salt caves, magma lakes, moonmilk rivers, swirling gases and, judging from the below trailer, enormous maggots and centipedes.

          "description": "Game sharing has been a common practice on PlayStation consoles, especially during the days when physical copies of games were more prevalent. PlayStation players could simply lend their game discs to a friend after completing it so that their friends could try the game out for themselves. The process to share digital games on the PS5 is obviously different, with no physical edition to simply hand over.\n\n\nTo allow players to share games with each other, Sony had the gameshare feature on PlayStation 4, and it is also available on PlayStation 5. However, it is called the “Console Sharing and Offline Play” feature on the PS5.\n\n\nRegardless of the name, the functionality remains the same. When you gameshare on PS5, it allows you to share your game library with a friend.\n\n\nKeep in mind that you can only gameshare with one friend only. Before dividing further into gameshare, it is also important to understand that this feature is primarily designed to allow any user to play games on a specific PS5 console.\n\n\nHow to enable gameshare on PS5\n\n\n\nLog in to your PSN account on your PS5.\n\n\nHead to Settings.\n\n\nGo to Users and Accounts.\n\n\nNavigate to the Other section.\n\n\nSelect Console Sharing and Offline Play. Select ‘Disable’ if gamesharing is already on for this console.\n\n\nLog out of your PSN account on your PS5.\n\n\nLog in to your PSN account on your friend's PS5 console.\n\n\nGo to the Console Sharing and Offline Play menu once again, and select ‘Don’t Disable’ option.\n\n\n\nThat’s it! Now you can play PlayStation games in your Library across these consoles. You can log back in to your PSN account on your PS5 console and continue to play your games without any issues.\n\nThe post How to gameshare on PS5 appeared first on Destructoid.",

We're here to keep you in the loop about the status of Brawl Stars servers and how you can check on them yourself.\n\n\nIs Brawl Stars down?\n\n\nAs of now, Brawl Stars servers are experiencing some temporary issues, with many users reporting difficulties in accessing matchmaking. I, too, have found myself stuck on the loading screen while trying to find other players.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe problem is likely tied to a recent issue that prevented players from entering the Mega Pig matchmaking. Supercell has now switched off this feature and has replaced it with a Classic Challenge. The Brawl Stars Twitter/X account has also indicated that the servers have been overloaded. Fortunately, the matchmaking services will be \"improving slowly,\" to get you back in the game. \n\n\n\n\nAccording to the post, Supercell is working on fixes that may be disrupting the servers. All we can really do now is wait and see if the problems clear up before returning to matchmaking. You can also try restarting your game, but it doesn't seem to do much during this time. \n\n\nHow to check Brawl Stars server status\n\n\nIf you want to stay up-to-date on Brawl Stars' server status, go to Down Detector to see if there's a surge in reports. Those who notice a spike in the charts should probably steer clear of the game until it starts to go down.\n\n\nBesides Down Detector, the Brawl Stars Twitter/X page often posts about fixes for recent problems.

Dawntrail has added a whole new continent, and along with it, new Hunt Marks to track and take down. This can mean only one thing - a new mount. \n\n\nThe mount that you can get through The Dawn Hunt in Dawntrail is called Ullr, and it is a majestic, metallic dragon-esque creature with what appears to be a spear attached to its face. \n\n\nHow to get the Ullr mount in Final Fantasy XIV\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nTo get the Ullr mount, you’re going to have to put in a lot of effort, and take down a lot of A and S Rank Hunt Marks in Dawntrail areas. These monsters are incredibly challenging to take down, all level 100, and you’re likely to die more than a few times in your endeavors. \n\n\nYou’ll need to complete two achievements in FFXIV to unlock Ullr:\n\n\n\nDawn of a New A Game III\n\nSlay 2,000 Rank A Elite Marks in Dawntrail regions\n\n\n\n\nDawn of a New S Game III\n\nSlay 1,000 Rank S Elite Marks in Dawntrail regions\n\n\n\n\n\nThese achievements bring with them titles, “...of the Bright Plume” and “Winged  Death…” respectively, so they’re definitely worth going for individually. But if you want the mount and unlock the “Dawnbright Hunter” achievement, you’ll need to do both and this can prove challenging. \n\n\nHow to take down a lot of Hunt Marks in FFXIV\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe best way to take down a large number of A and S Rank Hunt Marks is via Hunt Train. These are community led events which see a lot of players joining forces and traveling around Dawntrail to take down as many monsters as they can. \n\n\nTo find a Hunt Train, your best bet is to join the Faloop! Discord server to find a Hunt Train on your server. Players are usually very inviting and welcoming to those who are new to Hunt Trains, and you can find a party within the Train to help you survive the tough battles against A and S Rank Marks. \n\nThe post How to get the Ullr mount in Final Fantasy XIV (FFXIV) appeared first on Destructoid.",

That’s all we really have about Hashire Hebereke EX.\n\n\nIt was announced via Twitter, and the link for more information goes to a press release that is mostly just descriptions of the involved companies. The Twitter account reveals that there will be more characters, more levels, and online multiplayer.\n\n\n\n\nUfouria: The Saga was initially released in Japan as Hebereke, which Sunsoft had hoped to turn into a franchise based around memorable characters. While the original is an exploration platformer, the games that came out after covered a variety of genres. It didn’t return to the sidescroller setup until this year with Ufouria: The Saga 2.\n\n\nOf the spin-offs, 1994’s Hashire Hebereke was one of the better ones. It’s an isometric foot-racing game with weapons. It involves the cast of the series running laps and competing for top position. It’s simple, and quick, and it had split-screen multiplayer.\n\n\nIt’s not a bad choice for a revival, though there isn’t any information suggesting whether it’s an enhanced port or a full remake. It’s nice to see the series get some recent love.\n\n\nNo release window was provided Hashire Hebereke EX.

The glove brings you back to the location you were in seven seconds ago, and this makes it a powerful glove to have in Slap Battles. The “It’s Rewind Time” ability can come in handy in many situations as it can save you from a fall, and the ability takes things one step further. The Recall glove also creates a portal, one at the location where you trigger it, and another where the ability eventually takes you back.\n\n\nWhen used correctly, it can not only bring you back from the brink of death but also send an opponent to the other end of the portal where they would fall to their death.\n\n\nScreenshot via Destructoid\n\n\nHow to get the Recall glove …",

Thankfully, they're not too beefy, so you should be able to run the game if you have a fairly modern set up. \n\n\nFC 25 minimum system requirements\n\n\nIn order to play EA Sports' beautiful game on PC, you'll need the following FC 25 minimum system requirements. They are as listed on Steam:\n\n\n\nOS: Windows 10 - 64-Bit\n\n\nProcessor: AMD Ryzen 5 1600 or Intel Core i5 6600k\n\n\nMemory: 8 GB RAM\n\n\nGraphics: AMD RX 570 or Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti\n\n\nDirectX: Version 12\n\n\nNetwork: Broadband Internet connection\n\n\nStorage: 100 GB available space\n\n\n\n8GB of RAM for your PC shouldn't be too much of a hassle, but giving your rig enough storage space at 100GB might be a pain.\n\n\nImage via EA Sports\n\n\nIt's actually smaller than other modern releases, however, with Bethesda RPG Starfield needing 125 GB and NBA 2K24 taking a massive 150GB. \n\n\nRecommended specs for FC 25 on PC\n\n\nFC 25 on PC needs an extra 4GB of RAM to run at the recommended specs than the minimum.

While some are easily obtainable in Karakura Town, others require you to go the extra mile. The God's Prize is a perfect example of that, as it can be challenging to find. We're here to show you how to get and use God's Prize in Type Soul to make the search easier.\n\n\nWhere to find God's Prize in Type Soul\n\n\nPlayers can obtain the God's Prize in Type Soul from Legendary drops in Ranked PvP. This mode won't be available to you initially since it will be locked behind a particular grade. Specifically, you must reach Special Grade 1 to unlock it.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nReaching this rank won't be easy and will likely take up a lot of your time. Earn enough XP to increase your grade, getting closer to Ranked mode.\n\n\nOnce players unlock Ranked in Type Soul, they'll enter a queue to begin a PvP match. A God's Prize may drop in your inventory if you come out victorious. Unfortunately, the item won't always appear, so you must participate in more rounds. Win enough matches until you are lucky enough to get the God's Prize in Type Soul.\n\n\nApart from Ranked PvP, you can see if other players will initiate a trade for it. Check out Type Soul's Discord channel to set up a link. \n\n\nHow to use God's Prize in Type Soul\n\n\nYou can equip yourself with the God's Prize like any other Type Soul accessory. The item will then grant you the following attributes:\n\n\n\nReiatsu Regen increase\n\n\n+15 Health\n\n\n+15 Reiatsu \n\n\n+5 Posture\n\n\n\nWith these buffs, your character will gain a positive boost in performance. Not only will it improve the fighter's health, but it will also increase the Reiatsu force's energy during battle.\n\nThe post How to get and use God’s Prize in Type Soul appeared first on Destructoid.",

There are different tasks, and all of them have certain conditions. Unlike the recently released El Shaarawy objective, you won't have to play in the Champions Finals mode to get Adeyemi. \n\n\nAll EA FC 24 Karim Adeyemi Futties objective tasks\n\n\nThe latest objective set has four tasks. You can complete the tasks in any order, but do remember that some of them will finish quicker.\n\n\n\nPrecise Finisher: Score a goal using players from the Bundesliga in 5 separate Squad Battles matches on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions).\n\n\nRapid Distributor: Assist 7 goals with a player with Min. 93 PAC in Squad Battles matches on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions).\n\n\nPlay 6: Play 6 matches in Squad Battles on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions).\n\n\nGerman Triumph: Win 5 matches in Squad Battles on Min. Semi-Pro difficulty (or Rivals/Champions) while having Min. 3 players from Germany in your starting 11.\n\n\n\nWhile you can complete the tasks in three different game modes, I would select Squad Battles. It's always easier to tackle AI-controlled opponents. To complete the tasks, you might have to replace some of your best cards. Hence, Squad Battles is the way to go, and you can also unlock additional packs along the way as part of weekly rewards. \n\n\nFor a free item in EA FC 24 Ultimate, Adeyemi Futties looks pretty decent. I always love to have Finesse Shot+ on my attacker, and Rapid+ is a bonus in the current meta. This card also has 5* Weak Foot, but the 91 Shooting will certainly need a chemistry modifier. \n\n\nAll things considered, the objective is certainly worth completing, and at worse, you'll get a high-rated fodder for free. \n\nThe post EA FC 24: How to get Karim Adeyemi Futties card for free appeared first on Destructoid.",

Here’s how you to make the Blades your Xbox background:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Press the Xbox button on your controller to open the guide.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Navigate to Profile &amp; system &gt; Settings &gt; General &gt; Personalization &gt; My background &gt; Dynamic backgrounds.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Choose Xbox 360 Blades under Featured or Xbox dynamic backgrounds</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Select the background art you want using the A button.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You can read more about the impending Xbox 360 store closure and final updates by visiting this <a href=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/05/14/xbox-360-price-reductions-available-now/\">Xbox Wire article</a>.</p>",

It's not the first time the series has explored this dimension, but it is a rare occurrence.

It is being published, or presented by, as the trailer implies, Arc System Works, the developer behind Guilty Gear and Dragon Ball FighterZ.</p>\n\n<p>Double Dragon Revive is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and One, and PC sometime in 2025.</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameBorder=\"0\"  allow=\"autoplay\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iQiA3sCuqIs\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\n\n<p>For a whole lot more on Double Dragon, but maybe not the version of Double Dragon you're thinking, <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/02/20/double-dragon-the-forgotten-bad-video-game-movie\">head here</a> to read all about the 1994 movie.
