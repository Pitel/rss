Sure, LEGO Horizon Adventures is a fun, tongue-in-cheek spin-off of Guerrilla's series, but we were still a little taken aback to see that Switch logo at the end of the trailer.\nElsewhere, Switch gamers saw announcements and trailers for Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions, Neva, Civilization VII, Battle Crush, Monster Hunter Stories, and Sonic X Shadow Generations, plus the 'Outersloth' indie dev initiative from Among Us dev Innersloth will surely yield some fruit on Nintendo's console, too.

It does have snow nazis in however, possibly the rarest flavour of Nazi after Cookies n’ Cream and Original. You’ll find the trailer below. Be careful: it’s official. Also, it’s mainly just one very long cutscene, so if you want to save that stuff for when the game’s out, maybe don’t bother.\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Computer Artworks' 2002 videogame adaptation of 1982 movie The Thing was a ghoulish and gripping third-person shooter with some terrific mechanics that weren't quite fleshed out, flesh being the operative word. For instance: you can enlist surviving soldiers as squadmates, but are they really surviving soldiers, or are they human-shaped warrens of teeth and mandibles poised to split open and shower you in digestive juices? You have a limited supply of blood tests with which to determine whether any people you rescue are Things in waiting - and even as you're worrying about them, they're casting suspicious eyes at you, care of some embryonic \"trust\" and \"fear\" systems.\nSadly, much of this acute paranoia could be easily gamed out in practice - back in 2002, I deduced that contact with enemies increased the odds of infection, and adopted a policy of shooting anyone who'd been in my squad for too long. But it's the kind of system an intelligent remake could pounce upon and have fun with. Sadly, Nightdive are not working on a remake, like their previous System Shock remakes.

The developers have shown off the two-player update amid the summer news plague that is threatening to tear entire branches off the RPS treehouse this week. \"Summoned by blood and born in corruption, this wicked new ally can join the holy Lamb in local co-op,\" say publishers Devolver.

The hat makes you look like an eraser pencil from Forbidden Planet. It's the kind of headgear worn by the kind of criminal Batman's too grown-up to fight anymore. But it has, nonetheless, roused in this under-dressed stranger a sense of Dionysian frenzy. He will do anything for that hat - hewing your arms off, ripping your intestines out, tearing the skin from your ribcage. And you, in turn, will do anything to rob him of that mattock, because by the gods, it looks a lot more dangerous than the candlestick you're trying to fend him off with.\r\n\n\r\nThere are many such lost souls in the bleak, midnight world of the Half Sword demo - all lurking near candle-lit piles of randomly spawned hammers, stools, barrels, axes and lengths of wood, all subject to unforgivably authentic physics and cursor-based attacks that conspire to transform every scuffle into a Monty Python blooper reel.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Run art-stealing generation tools faster! Oh, Computex, what have they done to you, and why do you have seven fingers on one hand?\nGranted, AI is a broad field, and not everything about it is necessarily gross or creatively bankrupting. But it also doesn’t deserve to overshadow all the other useful, unexpected, and curiosity-piquing gaming tech that Computex has to offer, from new Steam Deck alternatives to resurrected CPU lineups and promising graphics card updates.

Sorry, did I say ‘worthwhile art’? I meant to say “lots of money.” Let’s get clicking!\nFirst up, I need to name my studio (I settle on Horace's Revenge) as well as my crack new team of business bastards. There’s my chief legal officer, Jebediah End. My CCO, Anne Egg, and CFO, Rummy McLastdrink. He doesn’t have a sauce problem, because obviously I wouldn’t put him in charge of money if he did. In the wreckage of the studio, we find an unedited film reel hidden in the waffles n’ cocaine cupboard. It’s a noir thriller named ‘Messenger Of Death’. Whatever influential critic is currently directing this era’s discourse has chosen to categorise each film as genre percentages (‘60% detective/40% thriller’), and setting (‘modern American city’.)

          "description": "Roguelike FPS Wild Bastards is the space western follow up to 2019’s Void Bastards. It takes some of that game’s ideas, mainly those related to shooty and looty, and reforms them into a largely different can o’ campfire beans. This time, it’s less focused on exploration, more on individual, tense shoot-outs. You collect a cast of weirdos, each with different guns and abilities, and form the deadliest dang posse this side of the last tactical overworld map you descision'd your way through. I like what I've played so far, although I think a lot is going to hinge on how much evolution the mid-game offers. As always, here’s a Steam demo, if you want to be all contrary and 'form your own opinions'. Pah.\n \nRead more",

But these spaces are just as mesmerising to fly through and think about when not focussed on finding the perfect line through the next corner, or avoiding a patch of grass.

          "description": "Honestly, I turn my back on shooter-of-note Helldivers 2 for (checks calendar)... one, maybe two weeks, and you all go and transform a planet into a black hole. \"You\" being the players who completed the metagame's last Major Order and successfully pumped the Terminid supercolony of Meridia full of an experimental \"Dark Fluid\" - which Super-Earth, incidentally, pinched from the Illuminate faction during the First Galactic War, aka Helldivers 1.\nNow, Meridia has imploded and become a radiant, wailing, purple-fringed disc of pure nothingness, with triumphant players rudely ejected from orbit via emergency hyperspace jump, but subsequently allowed to return and gaze into the dark heart of their victory. Great work, Inferno-plungers. I'm sure the consequences of this will be neither cosmic nor horrible.\n Read more",

          "description": "Update: Card Bard appears to be a copy of a game by another developer, Dire Decks by kindanice. Dire Decks was released in 2023 on itch.io and was well received there. Kindanice has pointed out the direct likeness between their game and the one released on Steam under another name. Yikes. Thanks to our diligent commenters for catching this. We'll try to find out more. \nOriginal article: The onslaught of fun Steam Next Fest demos you can play right now continues and will not relent. Card Bard is a deckbuilding roguelike shooter in which your wee gunman is seemingly frozen in abject terror as little pill-shaped baddies creep towards him like bacteria on a petri dish. Good thing you have a hand of cards, each one showing how many bullets will bop forth from your body when you select it. It's surprisingly tough for something so pastel-paletted. I'm 10th on the leaderboard. You can probably beat that, right?\r\n\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "In EA's Desert Strike - released way back in the dim salvages of 1992 - you are a helicopter pilot scooting around a Sylvester Stallone reinvention of Iraq, shooting down tanks and fighters with guns and missiles while rescuing VIPs and fretting constantly about your wafer-thin armour and espresso-sized fuel reserves. It was a no-frills piece of Gulf War fanfic, complete with George Bush ending cameo, and a well-made shooter that used to drive me nuts on Sega Mega Drive.\nMegacopter: Blades Of The Goddess is Desert Strike, but heavily Blood-Dragonified and with a big dollop of Airwolf to boot. Here, the enemy troops are naughty Reptoid aliens, the writing is scattershot-satirical (upgrades are bought with pizza tokens) and your helicopter houses the soul of a blood-drinking \"AZ-TECH\" goddess. Is it a nuanced parody of the Strike series? It doesn't feel like it. Did I enjoy the demo? Yes. Does it have a crawling tentacle boss called Queen Oildusa? Also yes, and will you please stop asking questions so I can write the rest of this article.\n Read more",

The 2-hour show hosted by marketing man Geoff Keighley will be broadcasting on Friday, blasting you in the ocular nerves with, probably, a lot of games. However, most of these games will not be brand new, exciting reveals, said Keighley himself in a fresh Twitch Q & A. \"There will be, definitely, new announcements,\" he said, \"but the show is largely focused on, I think, existing games that have new updates for fans.\" He's mentioning this ahead of time, he said, to set expectations.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Not just a bottomless pit, but a conveniently portable, Looney Tunes-esque hole into which you could seemingly chuck everything from items and equipment to characters. Speaking to me during the same interview in which they discussed long-abandoned plans for bringing back Baldur’s Gate 1’s Candlekeep, Larian CEO Swen Vincke and Baldur’s Gate 3 lead writer Adam Smith (RPS in peace) touched on the subject with tantalising brevity. Argh, if only I hadn’t had to run off and catch a taxi, I’d still be there now, discussing the many applications of a portable hole. Bypassing carrying capacity limits would just be the start of it.\n Read more",

It's a creative building game like The Sims 4 but with none of the fuss of actually controlling lives - and no quests, combat or arbitrary challenges of any kind.\r\n\r\nInstead, Tiny Glade simply offers a meadow and tools with which to build. The vibe of the game is cottage-core at its finest, with enough whimsigoth finery that you'll soon lament that you can't actually live inside your glorious creations.

          "description": "A DIY engineer has created a realistic tank simulator that puts the average haptic controller to shame. The mechanical monster is jury-rigged to the top of an office desk and must be reloaded with a new shell after every shot. The recoil is terrifying. It's operated by three people: one person drives the tank with a steering wheel and levers, another uses cranks to aim the gun barrel, and a third reloads the shells that eject automatically from the chamber after every desk-lifting blast. The \"shells\" in question are 2-litre bottles of fizzy drink, and the crew has set up a whole rack of these bottles for panicked reloading. If you are the kind of person who yearns for the immersion of the legendary Steel Battalion controller then you will get a definite buzz from watching the death machine in action below. \nRead more",

Půjde o novou generací mobilních procesorů Core Ultra, která navazuje na loňský Meteor Lake. Bude mít dva typy jader: efektivní E-jádra a výkonná P-jádra. Intel také prozradil, že půjde o kombinaci 4E+4P s vypnutým hyper-threadingem. Přidělování jednotlivých úloh závisí na operačním systému, jehož plánovač musí v reálném čase provádět úpravy nastavení vyvažující efektivitu s výpočetním výkonem v závislosti na intenzitě pracovní zátěže.",

In addition to going up to 16 cores versus 8 with the Xeon E-2400 series, the more competitive pricing, the 3D V-Cache SKUs, and 28 PCIe lanes rather than 20, the AMD EPYC 4004 models also support DDR5-5200 memory where as the Intel Raptor Lake E-2400 models are bound to DDR5-4800. In this follow-up testing is a look at the AMD EPYC 4004 performance both at DDR5-4800 and DDR5-5200 speeds for showing the performance difference.",

          "description": "Developer Frost Giant Studios revealed its upcoming RTS Stormgate's third playable faction today as the Celestial Armada. An ancient and advanced civilization, the Celestial Armada traverses the universe in massive world-ships ruled by the Sovereigns, immortal beings. Frost Giant also announced an August 13 release date for the RTS Early Access to begin.\n\n\n\n\nEssentially space nomads, the playstyle of the Celestial Armada looks rather unique compared to the two other factions. The Celestial Armada is built around the Arcship, a flying HQ that assists with the creation of new bases rather than utilizing builder units like the other factions. Similar to the Protoss from StarCraft, buildings constructed by the Celestial Armada will generate a cascade field that expands the possible building area for the faction.\n\n\nInterestingly, the Celestial Armada does not have to worry about supply. This faction starts with the max cap of 300, and can build as many units as their resources allow. Primarily focused on buildings rather than units, the Celestial Armada also has to juggle maintaining an efficient power grid by building power-generating structures to support the many buildings it will construct.\n\n\nThose wanting to try out the upcoming RTS early can do so by purchasing a Founder's pack for access on July 30, or wait until it releases for free into Early Access on August 13, 2024 on PC via Steam.\n\nThe post Stormgate third faction revealed to be the Celestial Armada, RTS enters Early Access on August 13 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "CoD Next is back for a third consecutive year and is set to give fans an in-depth look at Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.  \n\n\nAnticipation for Black Ops 6 is at an all-time high. During the CoD Direct, Treyarch dropped a boatload of information about the campaign, multiplayer, and zombies. Key highlights included 16 new multiplayer maps, a new omnidirectional movement system, two round-based zombies maps, and a spy action thriller campaign set in a post-cold war landscape in 1991. \n\n\nWhen is CoD Next 2024?\n\n\n\n\nCoD Next 2024 will be held on August 28. Treyarch did not confirm a start time for the event. For reference, CoD Next 2023 started at noon est. \n\n\nHow to watch CoD Next 2024\n\n\nCoD Next 2024 will be streamed on the official Call of Duty YouTube and Twitch channels. As was the case last year, we expect there to be exclusive Twitch drops and YouTube rewards for watching the streams. Fans can also watch the event from their favorite streamers' prospective, as dozens of content creators will be flown out to show off their skills. \n\n\nWhat to expect from Cod Next 2024\n\n\nFans certainly get their money's worth from CoD Next events. In 2023, Activision gifted fans with a four-hour livestream. Over 100 content creators were flown out and played several Modern Warfare 3 matches across a few of the title's maps. Then, those streamers played several Warzone matches, and gave players a first look at Urzikstan. In between, there were developer interviews filled with new nuggets about every game mode. \n\n\nCoD Next 2024 will most likely follow a similar format and provide gameplay footage from some of the 16 new multiplayer maps. Most Warzone information remains shrouded in mystery, as Treyarch kept tight-lipped about the battle royale during the CoD Direct. \n\nThe post How to watch CoD Next 2024: Black Ops 6 event date, streams, more appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "For the first time since 2021, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 brings back round-based zombies. \n\n\nAs part of Call of Duty Direct, Treyarch confirmed that Black Ops 6 will launch with two round-based zombie maps. Liberty Falls is set in West Virginia during the day, while Terminus is set in a black site area with a dark setting. \n\n\nZombies in Black Ops 6 continues the narrative that started in Black Ops 6. Treyarch confirmed a mix of new and returning power-ups and a healthy dose of easter eggs for players to put their detective hats on to solve. In addition, the movement overhaul will also be available for players in Zombies. This means that players will be able to slide, dive, and sprint in any direction, and the intelligent movement option allows you to move forward and auto sprint, auto mantle, and auto crouch. Lastly, the new Supine Prone lets you rotate your body while laying prone. Treyarch also teased that there will be new zombie-exclusive features too. \n\n\n\n\nThis has been a long time coming for Zombies fans. Treyarch opted to turn away from round-based gameplay in CoD Vanguard and instead focused on players completing objectives, which went down poorly with the Zombies community. The decision went down poorly, so the development team backtracked and added round-based maps at the end of the title's life cycle. As it turned out, those two maps wound up being the last two round-based environments for several years. \n\n\nThankfully, players won't have to wait much longer, as Treyarch plans to unveil new information about the beloved game mode in the following weeks. \n\nThe post CoD Black Ops 6 finally ends the round-based Zombies map drought appeared first on Destructoid.",

With each passing year, she lowers this age limit, eliminating swaths of lives, and spurring those who remain to seek her out and stop her from inking her canvas in blood.\n\n\n\n\nThe most striking quality is the dynamic RPG action with real-time prompts, which the developers refer to as reactive turn-based battles. Players are able to take their time selecting which abilities to use but then must perform action commands to execute the moves effectively, such as mashing button presses or aiming at weak points. These actions can also be reactive, allowing players to parry an incoming attack with a well-timed input. Think Paper Mario, but with spells, guns, and fantastical cinematic flare. \n\n\nDespite all the added action elements, the game is still first and foremost an RPG with upgradable equipment and branching skill trees that encourage players to craft a playstyle that suits them best.\n\n\nThis ethereal adventure is being developed in Unreal Engine 5 and is the first game from developer Sandfall Interactive, with publisher Kepler Interactive backing the project.\n\n\nTime is ticking away, so look forward to playing this day one on Gamepass, Xbox Series X|S, Playstation 5, and PC (Steam and EGS) when the calendar year is painted to 2025.\n\n\nThis is a developing news story.\n\nThe post Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 announced at Xbox Games Showcase appeared first on Destructoid.",

The original Gears of War starts 14 days after E-Day, with franchise hero Marcus Fenix imprisoned for abandoning his post. \n\n\nA new Gears game was the predominant rumor going into the Xbox Showcase, with fans eagerly awaiting a new entry in the store series. Gears has long been a fan-favorite Xbox franchise, praised for its storytelling, visceral action, and first-in-class multiplayer experience. \n\n\nThis marks the first mainline series entry since 2019's Gears 5. That game ended with Marcus, his son J.D., and allies Del and Marcus forming the new Delta Squad. The last overall release was 2020's RTS experience, Gears Tactics. \n\n\nWe gave Gears 5 an 8/10, calling it \"an amplification of everything every Gears before did well,\" and \"a maturation of everything those same games struggled with.\"\n\n\nGears of War: E-Day does not currently have a release date, but will be available at launch on Game Pass. \n\nThe post Gears of War prequel E-Day announced appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The latest Indiana Jones and The Great Circle trailer captures everything fans love about the iconic movie franchise, and even includes a nod to where it all started. \n\n\nDuring the Xbox Games Showcase, Bethesda provided another look at Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. The trailer did not confirm an official release date beyond the 2024 release window already known. Still, it did show Indy and his sidekick Gina in action deep in the Himalayas as they hunt down an artifact called The Great before the Germans get to it first. \n\n\n\n\nThe first-person, single-player adventure is set between the events of Raiders of the Lost Arc and the Last Crusade, meaning Indiana Jones is still in his prime. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle features a mix of puzzles, dramatic action set pieces, up close and personal fist fights, and gunslinging. Also, it wouldn't be an Indiana Jones title without being able to use his trusty whip in action. \n\n\nThis is a developing news story and will be updated as new information is available. \n\nThe post Latest look at Indiana Jones and the Great Circle feels just like the movies appeared first on Destructoid.",

Not long after revealing a release date for the upcoming World of Warcraft: The War Within expansion, Blizzard revealed the opening cinematic as well as a release date for the first Diablo 4 expansion, Vessel of Hatred. Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred will be released on all platforms on October 8, 2024.\n\n\n\n\nThe cinematic trailer is just as hellish as you've come to expect from Blizzard and its Diablo 4 cinematics. Tempted by the Prime Evil Mephisto, Neyrelle heads to the new jungle region of Nahantu.\n\n\nPlayers will follow Neyrell to Nahantu where they can play as the new Spiritborn class, recruit mercenaries to join them in combat, and participate in an all-new PvE co-op activity with friends.\n\n\nFollowing the recently released Season 4: Loot Reborn, this feels like a great release time for the expansion. The Loot Reborn season essentially changed how loot works in the popular ARPG, paving the way for a great opportunity for some new Diablo 4 content using the new systems.\n\n\nDiablo 4: Vessl of Hatred will be released on all platforms on October 8, 2024.\n\nThe post Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred opening cinematic is exceptionally hellish, expansion set to release October 8, 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

This one is the first trailer to include actual gameplay.\n\n\nThe trailer shows off what I’d expect from a sequel to the N64 classic. There’s actual stealth and gadgets, and the levels look somewhat non-linear, maybe. I did not, however, see a large-headed alien or a presidential clone, but there’s still time. We do see the series’ protagonist, Joanna Dark, and mention of Daniel Carrington, though he seems to be the target of the mission.\n\n\n\n\nActually, a lot of the trailer reminds me of marketing material from around the Xbox 360 release. Parkour, gunfights behind fruit, and first-person tricks. Not that I expected it to look like an N64 game. This just looks a little generic. If it borrows the objective-based gameplay of Goldeneye and the original Perfect Dark, that would be a pretty good hook.\n\n\nA release date hasn’t been stated, and neither have its target platforms.

True to rumors, Doom: The Dark Ages is coming in 2025.\n\n\nThe trailer doesn’t show much in terms of narrative but suggests it takes place before Doomguy became a hero. More accurately, judging by the tech on display and how it relates to Doom Eternal, it looks like it will take place during Doomguy’s time as a Sentinel. This happens after Doom 64, and seemingly in an alternate universe/timeline from the original ‘90s games.\n\n\n\n\nThat makes it somewhat predictable what the story will be. The worlds of the Sentinels will be invaded by Hell. Doomguy will impress the Sentinels with his sheer rage and hatred for demons. He’ll probably lead the Night Sentinels into Hell. The priests will betray them to the Makyrs. Doomguy will wind up entombed and on ice until the start of Doom (2016).\n\n\nNot important, I guess. The gameplay shows off a lot of locations on Sentinel worlds like Argent D’nur. Doomguy has a shield that is also a sawblade and a mix of weapons both familiar and more primitive. Many of the enemies are familiar.\n\n\nI’m down. I absolutely loved Doom Eternal. It has some of the most intense combat I’ve experienced in an FPS. While the narrative they have set up isn’t exactly one I’m very interested in, I’m always down for more of the gameplay. I mean, it looks like we'll be able to finally pilot one of those big robot suits that were always hanging around in Doom Eternal.\n\n\nDoom: The Dark Ages is coming to Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC sometime in 2025.\n\nThe post Doom: The Dark Ages takes Doomguy back to his days as a Sentinel appeared first on Destructoid.",

It's great timing for Fallout 76, which has seen a recent resurgence in player numbers due to the wildly popular Fallout show that was released on Amazon.\n\n\nNear the end of the trailer, we also get a glimpse of the new Ghoul type, called The Lost, as well as a teaser that, in early 2025, players will actually be able to play as a Ghoul.\n\n\nI haven't played Fallout 76 since it originally launched and wasn't too fond of it.

And, as the name suggests, it brings Doomguy to a more medieval setting. Revealed during today's Xbox Games Showcase, The Dark Ages sees the infamous demon defeater shoot and blast his way through a world seemingly inspired by medieval scenery. It will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (and Xbox and PC Game Pass) sometime next year. \nFret not, though. It's still very much Doom, with plenty of weapons, demons from hell, some fantastic metal music, and a ton of gory first-person shooter action. \nCheck it out for yourself in the Doom: The Dark Ages reveal trailer below: \n\n\nAs you can see from the trailer above, Doom: The Dark Ages is a visual departure from the rest of the series. The scenery, weaponry, and even the enemies look significantly more medieval than anything else seen in the Doom series. There even appears to be a rideable dragon, too. \nId Software rebooted the series back in 2016 with Doom, which we loved – read why in Game Informer's Doom review. The studio followed it up with Doom Eternal in 2019, which we enjoyed even more. Read Game Informer's Doom Eternal review to find out why we gave it a 9.25 out of 10. \nInterestingly, this is the first Doom game from Id Software and publisher Bethesda Softworks since Microsoft (and Xbox) acquired Bethesda parent company ZeniMax Media in 2020 for $7.5 billion. Many have speculated how Xbox will handle exclusivity with its recent years of acquisitions, including whether future Doom, Call of Duty, and other popular IPs now under the Xbox umbrella will get multiplatform releases. It seems, in Doom's case at least, it will still come to PlayStation, which makes sense, considering Doom and Doom Eternal were released there as well. \nWhat do you think of Doom: The Dark Ages' reveal?

Not only can you improve their mech suits, of which 30 types exist, but you can grow meaningful relationships with your plucky pilot squad.\n\n\nThe game includes over 50 voiced characters to bond with over 50 story missions, and players can steer the narrative by making decisions such as choosing to side with one of five factions. Gameplay is all about building the most strategically viable hand based on your personal playstyle to wipe out what Trinket Studios describes as a \"star-consuming threat.\" \nBattle Suit Aces is slated to launch for PC via Steam at an unknown date.

          "description": "Publisher Nordcurrent Labs and newcomer developer River End Games have revealed Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream, a narrative-driven stealth-strategy adventure game launching next year. Revealed during today's Future Game Show Summer Showcase, Eriksholm comes from a team of developers whose experience includes Battlefield, Mirror's Edge, Little Nightmares, and Unravel. \nSet in the titular Eriksholm, a fictional city inspired by a Nordic aesthetic of the early 1900s, Eriksholm follows three protagonists united in their hearts to defy their oppressors. In the reveal trailer below, you can see one of those protagonists, Hanna, an adolescent orphan searching for her brother Herman. That journey transforms Hanna into a reluctant hero, inspiring herself and her friends to rise from the gutters of Eriksholm to become symbols of change. \nCheck it out for yourself in the Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream reveal trailer below: \n\n\nFrom Eriksholm's top-down 3D perspective, players will control the game's three protagonists to navigate through the city (aboveground and underground) while utilizing unique character skills, tools, weapons, and more to overcome enemies and complete puzzles. River End Games says players can freely move the in-game camera to survey the environment, plan their next steps, and execute strategies with perfect timing. \n\"All of us at River End Games are proud to finally reveal Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream to the world,\" studio founder and creative director Anders Hejdenberg writes in a press release. \"This is just the first glimpse of what we've done, and we hope it will capture your hearts and minds, just like it has captured ours. We can't wait to show you even more in the future.\" \nHere are some screenshots from the game: \n\nEriksholm: The Stolen Dream will launch in 2025 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store). \nWhat do you think about Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream's reveal?

We also learned that players can get their hands on it before its August launch.\nDustborn stars Pax, an ex-criminal with the unusual ability to weaponize words. As in, words are literally power for her as she can fight with shouts or manipulate people in conversations. While Pax can crack skulls using a bat and create new shouts to battle enemies, the game also focuses on building relationships with her crew of misfits (who have their own special powers). Set in an alternate Neo-western version of the U.S., you’ll travel across the country to transport an important package under the disguise of a traveling punk band. Check out its new trailer below. \n\n\nIf Dustborn piques your interest, you can play a 30-minute demo next week during Steam Next Fest from June 10-17.

It's the latest look at the game following its first gameplay appearance during last week's State of Play. \nThough this squad of hunters tries to fight back with gunfire, the ground gives way beneath them, trapping them inside a cave. We then see clips of a proper battle against these beasts, with one character using a very large gun and unleashing hell while atop a mount. The trailer also gives a few glimpses of story moments, but it's still hard to parse what the plot of Wilds entails. \n\n\nCapcom promised to share more detail about the game during Gamescom.

This upcoming action roguelite puts you in the boots of a bean who seemingly embodies every awesome trait of every action/spy hero you've ever seen.\n\n\nThe game's Steam page provides the following synopsis: \"After being betrayed by the Shadow Agency and learning the truth about their evil ways, Killer Bean has made it his life goal to destroy them. Yet this is easier said than done, as Killer Bean will face armies of enemies, and mysterious Shadow Beans who are better trained and more powerful than him.\"\nThe humourous gameplay trailer shows the game's ever-changing open world, which morphs each time you begin a new single-player campaign. As rogue assassin Killer Bean, you can blast apart enemies (in both 1st and 3rd person), which range from soldiers to giant, Metal Gear-esque walking mechs, suplex them with wrestling moves, blow them up with rockets or just plow them with your sports car. The world is your oyster, and the game seems to be a physics showcase, with copious amounts of ragdolling characters and objects. \nKiller Bean is slated to launch into Steam Early Access this summer.",
