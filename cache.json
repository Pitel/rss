It's not unreasonable to assume that the game will cross the 1,000,000 threshold by this time next week.\nElsewhere, We've got three newcomers in the form of Fashion Dreamer, WarioWare: Move It!, and Star Ocean: The Second Story R. Fashion Dreamer just managed to clinch the second spot this week, beating WarioWare by just 1,300 copies. Star Ocean, meanwhile, secured the fourth spot, missing out on number three by just 734 copies. It's been an extremely close race, that's for sure.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

But does the expansion end with a bang or a whimper? Well, much like prior waves, we’d say this one lands somewhere in the middle, offering up a bunch of solid circuits mixed in with a few mildly disappointing ones.\nPretty much par for the course, then, but let’s just remind ourselves of what’s included with this one. You’ve got two new cups — the Acorn Cup and the Spiny Cup — made up of three Tour tracks and five ‘legacy’ courses from previous series entries. Oh, and you've four new characters to try out, too.

While Fashion Dreamer is not technically part of the Style Savvy family (known as 'Style Boutique' in Europe), it offers fans of those DS and 3DS games an opportunity to take their fashion expertise to Nintendo Switch.\nUnfortunately, Fashion Dreamer’s gameplay leaves a lot to be desired. At the beginning, we are welcomed into a virtual world called Eve, where we play as an influencer putting together outfits for NPCs and even other players if utilizing the online mode. The majority of the game is spent creating outfits, called 'look-its,' for characters that are spaced out across a small map, called a 'cocoon.' Each character wants their outfit to meet specific criteria, like featuring a certain color, including a clothing item such as a jacket, or having a particular vibe such as being “cool” or “unique.”\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

A faked death finally saw him freed from the shackles of the yakuza with one big catch: he couldn't ever see his family again. Since then, we've had the plucky Ichiban take on the mantle of Tojo Clan nastiness in Yakuza: Like A Dragon (7), with its sequel Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth (8) set to wash up on Hawaii's shores next year. What do we know about Infinite Wealth? Kiryu is set to return as a protagonist alongside Ichiban, with an all-new haircut. And more importantly, what has Like A Dragon Gaiden got to do with any of this? Well, it's a shorter stop-gap between the events of Yakuza 6 and Yakuza 8 that fills us in on what Kiryu's been up to this whole time.\nBut aside from moreish minigames and a fantastic Agent persona with web-slinging abilities, Kiryu's epilogue is a far cry from Yakuza's best stories. By no means is it bad, it just isn't the best introduction to the series for newcomers, and even longtime fans will struggle balancing his resurrection with its heavy feelings of repetition.\nRead more",

I want someone who really, really loves and hates things, and gives you reasons why.”\nIt’s a trait which Giovannetti has in common with his Megacrit co-founder, Casey Yano, and has possessed ever since he was a kid growing up in Woodinville, 30 minutes outside Seattle. It’s matched by a competitiveness that first emerged in Warhammer 40,000 tournaments as a teen. Before he was old enough to drive, Giovannetti would ride his bike to the local game store and play until the early hours of the morning.\nRead more",

          "description": "GTA 6 publisher Take-Two Interactive’s CEO Strauss Zelnick has been on the blower to the company’s investors about the idea of making games using the latest artificial intelligence content generation tools. Echoing his relatively guarded enthusiasm for NFTs a couple of years ago, he’s sort of mixed on them, regarding AI tools less as transformative technologies than simply the latest step towards the eternal industry objective of More, Faster And Better For Less.\nZelnick thinks automated learning and generation tools will make development more “efficient” and games, overall “better”, but in terms of Take-Two’s own bottom line, any gains will likely be offset by the fact that other big companies have access to the same tools, and by the fact that Take-Two will take advantage of said efficiencies by setting more ambitious goals. As such, he doesn’t think using generative AI will lead to lower prices for big commercial games. If you’re a developer that can’t afford to buy or license generative “AI” tools, Zelnick added, you can expect competition to become “more intense” in the coming years. Good stuff. \nRead more",

          "description": "Intel's Core i5 12600KF is one of the company's best value gaming CPUs, and today it's down to $155 at Walmart versus its standard price of $220. \nThis chip offers solid gaming performance in modern AAA games plus PCIe 5.0 and DDR5 support (with the correct motherboard) all while costing significantly less than competing CPUs like the later 13600KF ($285) or AMD's Ryzen 5 7600 ($229) which offer only marginally better performance at 1080p and are basically the same speed at 1440p or 4K. \nFor reference, I saw the 12600K deliver a minimum of 85% of the performance of the later 13600K (and by extension the nearly identical 14600K), while costing 54% of the price with this deal - surely that makes the 12600K the obvious choice? \nRead more",

          "description": "As regular readers of this column will know, I'm a big fan of OLED TVs and monitors. One of my favourites is Dell's Alienware AW3423DWF, a 34-inch ultrawide that offers a fairly standard 3440x1440 165Hz spec - but its QD-OLED panel makes for a night-and-day difference against your standard VA and IPS panel alternatives, with perfect contrast, near-instant pixel response times, gorgeous colour reproduction and stunning HDR. \nIt normally retails for around £929, but today it's down to £739 when you use the code GROUPON8 at Dell UK. That's about as cheap as we've ever seen it, and well worth it for anyone that wants a monitor primarily for gaming rather than content creation or mixed purposes. \nRead more",

          "description": "Hallowe’en may be over (just), but for this month’s Reality Frights, I’ve got a wonderfully seasonal game for you. It’s the brand-new remake of the grand old mystery puzzler The 7th Guest, a game which Bill Gates notably referred to as “The new standard of interactive entertainment.” In fairness to ol’ William, he said this seven months before Doom blew out the new standard’s insides with a 12-gauge shotgun, shunting PC gamers’ tastes away from kitsch adventure games and toward grisly murder-fests. But The 7th Guest is nonetheless fondly remembered for its spooky atmosphere, alongside its blend of pre-rendered backgrounds and live action cutscenes you could call ‘pioneering’ had it not proved such an evolutionary dead end.\nToday, the original 7th Guest looks more dated than Henry VIII, which is probably why this remake replaces everything but the very skeleton of the 1993 original. The game still takes place in a creepy mansion belonging to a murderous toymaker, and still involves six eccentric guests to the house searching for a missing boy named Tad. But it’s otherwise been completely rebuilt, with whole new puzzles and whole new mechanics, all designed to be experienced in first-person VR.\nRead more",

I've long admired their intricate dances of orbs and criss-crossing laser fire, but I have long resigned myself to merely being a spectator of such games, rather than an active ship pilot. Cobalt Core, however, is exactly my kind of speed. It's not a bullet hell shooter, but it is about two spaceships facing off against each other in an eyes-locked duel of incoming cannon fire, and sliding side to side to avoid getting exploded as you attempt to unravel the mysterious timeloop your crew of weird space animals appear to be stuck in. Just, you know, in a neat, turn-based fashion, where your opponent's attacks are flagged up in advance, and you must use your randomised deck of cards to weave and dodge your way to victory. It's very moreish, and very Into The Breach. I love it. \nRead more",

You're not fooling me, Croteam. I'm here to solve puzzles and discuss philosophy, and I know you are too. You can't stop talking about philosophy in this game, and frankly, I wouldn't have it any other way. \nMillenia may have passed since the events of The Talos Principle, but the problems faced by this new society of advanced robo-humans (of which you are number 1000 to be 'born' into this world) still feel all too relevant to the issues posed by the lives we're living today: what is the price of progress? Will we ignore the mistakes of the past and push the world toward irreparable destruction? And why have cats remained loyal to this new race of robo-people, cementing their status as the superior future pet, when dogs have devolved back into vicious wolves?

It was a game in which every footfall felt like a gamble and every second lasted an eternity, even before you entered the lair of a giant spider. Fast  forward to 2023, and streamers are playing Hunt: Showdown like it's Titanfall 2, scurrying along walls with scant regard for the NPC cannon fodder below, duelling each other on rooftops with pistol shotguns, and tearing through those poor, befuddled boss monsters like sandcastles.\r\n\n\r\nThus the fate of any competitive shooter lucky enough to acquire a seasoned pro following, I guess. But still, returning to Crytek's PvPvE shooter has been a shock, and speaking to the development team, it sounds like the devs themselves have been struggling to keep up with the more ambitious players, too. Showdown was never expected to endure quite this long and evolve in quite this way, according to general manager David Fifield, and managing the community's ambitions for the game is as much of a challenge as compensating for the limitations of its ageing engine.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I am reminded of this tweet a lot, and I am reminded of it whenever I log on to Puzzmo, a new daily browser-based puzzle service from Orta Therox and Zach \"Zach Gage\" Gage.\nPuzzmo is great, and currently in a sort of gradually expanding beta where you can sign up to get a chance to be sent a log-in, or existing users can give two friends a log-in (I have used mine already, sorry). Every day you get a few different puzzles, with a subscription model offering bonus puzzles. I've not subbed because I'm just not built for anagram puzzles and I do not understand chess, which form about half of the daily offering, but I enjoy doing the daily fliparts and crosswords a lot. Except. The crosswords always have clues that are very specific to the USA.\nRead more",

In the dozens of open beta matches I've played, the result is as thrilling as those other games, but also exhausting.

You've surely seen a hundred post-Minecraft games about building a base to smelt iron to build a base, and probably even thought to yourself that they look entirely fine but kind of... redundant? There's only so many times you can walk back and forth from a cave to a forge.\nBut what if instead of trudging around a grey cave, you were driving a big drilling machine instead? It's so simple, and yet it makes all the difference in GeoDepths.\nRead more",

          "description": "Final Fantasy XIV’s world of Eorzea is a utopia. Sure, there’s the looming threat of Garlean invasion and/or the possibility of world destruction throughout A Realm Reborn and its expansions - but on the plus side, almost everyone you meet is up for a round of cards.\r\n\n\r\nOver the last quarter-century, Triple Triad has managed to escape its origins as a fun side minigame in Final Fantasy VIII to become a fully-fledged phenomenon in XIV. The Gold Saucer runs regular tournaments, random strangers are happy to be challenged to a match - often throwing in one or more of the game’s many variant rules (though Chaos can do one) - and might even give up one of their prized cards when defeated, with almost 400 to collect as of the game’s latest patches. Emphasis on the “might”: I dread to think of the hours spent replaying NPCs in the hope of a random drop as I filled out my collection.\r\n\nI headed along to Final Fantasy’s London Fan Fest last month with a fetching deck of Triple Triad cards in hand. (Square Enix provided entrance and accommodation for the event.) Where better to try and live the dream of challenging random strangers to a card game, and learn more about the community that has fallen in love with the MMO in the 10 years since A Realm Reborn released?\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I have a confession to make, readers. I'm mildly obsessed with Starfield's cuboid food brand Chunks. In all honesty, I'm kinda obsessed with Starfield's food in a more general sense, and I have almost as many screenshots of its tube-like meal boxes, stale toast slices, vacuum-packed sachets of rice balls, steak slabs and spiced worms - and, of course, Chunks - as I do its planets and NPCs. I'm weirdly fascinated by what Bethesda think our future meals will look like when we eventually start travelling across the stars, and not just because I like ragging on their somewhat plastic-looking textures and marvelling at how everything from orange juice to beer and wine comes in kid's size cartons with a little straw on the side. \nChunks are my favourite food of the lot, though. These cubes of faintly glistening organic matter are bite-sized monstrosities that are quite possibly some of the most unholy things I've ever seen. How this became the dominating foodstuff across the known galaxy is a mystery worthy of its own sidequest, because let's be honest, I'm all for eating wonky fruit and vegetables, but would you truly go to shop, sit down at a table and order an apple that's been squeezed into a perfect cube? Or a cube with yellow skin that professes to call itself grilled chicken? I would probably try them once for curiosity's sake (it's the food of the future, of course I want to know what that tastes like!), but it's also exactly the kind of thing I'd swear off immediately because nope, nuh uh, I just can't even contemplate it anymore. And then it dawned on me: this is exactly how I feel about Starfield as a whole.\nRead more",

Football Manager 2024 is the last iterative game in the series before Project Dragonfly arrives next year, through which Sports Interactive plan the most radical overhaul of the game since the introduction of the 3D match engine in FM 09. This includes a complete rebuild of Football Manager in Unity, implementing brand new animation technology, and the inclusion of women’s football. But there is a reason why the studio has stuck with this tried and tested formula for so long. Big changes come with big risks, and as any Man Utd fan will know, those changes don’t always pay off.\r\n\n\r\nBut such concerns are for the future. FM24 is with us right now, and while it may be swapping the dugout for the stands ninety minutes from now, this isn’t some ceremonial exhibition match. It’s business as usual, and in mostly good ways. Sports Interactive have made meaningful changes to the management game both on and off the pitch, all built on top of fundamentals that remain as complex and compulsive as they have for years. That said, FM24 also demonstrates why a change is welcome, as in its current form it can struggle to strike the balance between authenticity and fun.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I played a demo of Scene Investigators over the most recent Steam Next Fest, and was interested enough that I wanted to have a go with the full release. It's billed as a detective game for true crime fans, but it reminds me of those puzzle books you used to get, where you are shown an illustration of a crime scene and, if you stare at it long enough, can figure out the assigned solution. Scene Investigators is like that but the scene is a big 3D one you can walk around. A crime has happened and you need to figure out what, mostly by peering at the dates in a diary to cross reference them with the time and day a phone message was left. This is why I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. It's quite hard. But! Some people will really like it. \nRead more",

I hold its metal head in my hands, tilting it this way and that as I stare into its cold red eye. It offers no resistance to my pushes and pulls, as though I was a hairdresser directing a patron’s head. Based on Stanisław Lem’s 1964 novel of the same name, The Invincible’s Firewatch-like first-person adventure is intent on exploring how machines will come to shape humanity’s future. Over the course of its ten-hour story, where you step into the Soviet-styled space boots of biologist Yasna, you will take on her desperate search for the missing crew of her research ship, The Dragonfly, lost somewhere on the rocky, sandstorm-whipped world of Regis III.\nUsing a logbook filled with hand-drawn maps and scrawled notes, I’ve tracked Yasna’s crew to a makeshift game to the east of where they originally landed. Instead of humans, I find the lifeless robot. I want the android to give me answers, to tell me where my crew mates are, to explain what happened on Regis III, and why I can’t remember anything before I woke up in the desert with my possessions scattered around me.\nRead more",

          "description": "What kind of game does the label “survival horror” denote? Since its inconspicuous first appearance in the original Resident Evil’s loading screen (functioning first and foremost, lest we forget, as a handy marketing catchphrase), the term has been so enthusiastically embraced and haphazardly applied as to be rendered almost meaningless in 2023. Horror gaming has witnessed multiple seismic shifts since 1996, most notably the turn to action-oriented design with the likes of The Suffering and Resident Evil 4 in the mid-2000s, as well as the rise of spooky almost-walking-simulators like SOMA in the mid-2010s. \r\n\nYet the term survival horror has expanded to such a degree that it now seems to stand in, albeit rather awkwardly, for the entirety of video game horror. Even with the caveat that borders for these kinds of labels are notoriously hard to define, survival horror remains an unusually amorphous realm, one that (as a quick search of the relevant tag on Steam will reveal) lays claim as much to first-person bloodbaths like Zombie Army Trilogy as it does moody, combat-free adventures like Visage. Still, old distinctions linger, and a clutch of recent indie survival horrors qualify their work with the word “classic”. I interviewed some of the developers to find out why - and, more importantly, what classic survival horror means. \r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "It is perhaps ironic that in attempting to crystalise my thoughts about Alan Wake 2 - a game about a novelist with such crippling writer's block that they end up spawning an entire evil doppelganger of themselves to sabotage their own work - I, too, have been hopelessly staring at a blank screen for the better part of 24 hours. I have not, thank goodness, reached the stage where my psyche's split in two (yet), but this spiral of self-doubt has now got to the point where I simply have put words, any words, in front of one another to write my way out of this hellish pit of despair. \nAlan himself goes through a similar ordeal of writing to escape as he tries to find a way out of the prison-like dimension known as The Dark Place, where he's been trapped since the events of the first game - and I take heart from the fact that it's clearly well-worn territory for the folks at Remedy as well, such is the forensic precision in the way it's portrayed onscreen: a chaotic, supernatural tornado that not only threatens to unravel Alan's own identity, but also the wider world as we know it. It's imposter syndrome writ large, and honestly, Remedy are pretty on the money with this one. Horace is not a pretty taskmaster when the words stop coming.\nRead more",

          "description": "Thirsty Suitors is a dazzling new entry in a genre that is always badly in need of bolstering: turn-based RPGs without anime aesthetics and a story about something other than killing God. The game sees you play as Jala, who returns to her dilapidated hometown after getting dumped by the older woman for whom she abandoned college and her high school sweetheart. Waiting for her is a disappointed mother, a soon-to-be-wed sister who refuses to even speak to her, and a shadowy cabal formed of her spurned exes from the time in her life when rampant, unrelenting teen horniness nearly ripped the town apart. Jala’s journey to redemption and genuine adulthood will take her to the psychic plane to do cathartic (if overly simplistic) battle with her wronged exes, to the local skatepark to pull off some janky grinds, and to grounded emotional revelations that are rarely written this well in videogames.\nRead more",

          "description": "Beware major plot spoilers for the entire Amnesia series, together with descriptions of fictional torturing techniques.\n\r\nThe most ghoulish of Amnesia's many ghoulish ideas is \"vitae\". It's a luminous, blue-green fluid that can be used as an energy source, a chemical catalyst and a supernatural healing agent. Each Amnesia game is broadly a story about the production of vitae, with some levels consisting of huge distillation and refining apparata, and major plot developments tied to what you do with it. In the original Amnesia: The Dark Descent, you'll brew potions using vitae in order to keep a decapitated head alive. In 2020's Amnesia: Rebirth, you'll use ornate metal cannisters of the stuff like batteries to power otherworldly machines. Vitae is the blood and breath of Amnesia, the grease upon the narrative axels, the fuel in its boiler, the miracle McGuffin that sustains its nastier flights of fantasy. But what is vitae, exactly? Agony.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Starfield has already had Daleks added to its universe, and someone felt it was time for Doom to get the Doctor Who treatment as well.\n\n\nOver on ModDB, user ZuGineeris has decided DoomGuy needed to take a break from battling demons and fight Daleks instead. Conceived as a \"semi-joke/novelty,\" the mod replaces all the enemies in classic Doom with the iconic Doctor Who robots.\n\n\nImage via ZuGineeris/ModDB.\n\n\nThe description says there are 20 varieties (including some rare ones) and over 400 sounds to boot. There's not much more to be said about it. If you like Doom and legendary BBC sci-fi shows, this could be right up your alley.\n\n\nRight up there\n\n\nAt the risk of making some readers feel very ancient (myself included), Doom is about to turn 30 years old. Released in December 1993, id Software's influential FPS is still making waves in gaming to this day.\n\n\nOkay, it's obviously aged, but the fact that people are still tinkering with it, that the franchise is still going, and that people keep finding weird ways to play it to show what longevity really means (eat that, Skyrim).\n\n\nHelping to pretty much cement the early days of the first-person shooter genre, PC gaming has never really been the same since. Doom is undeniably a classic, and whether you want Daleks in hell instead of monsters or you want it to sound more like Half-Life, there's a mod for you out there somewhere.\n\nThe post Doom and Daleks, together at last, thanks to this mod appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Insomniac's Spider-Man 2 has had a phenomenal launch, securing its spot as one of the fastest-selling first-party PS5 games of all time. The studio has also announced that the game has already sold over 5 million copies. \n\n\n\n\nSpider-Man 2's sales have been nothing short of awe-inspiring, selling 2.5 million copies within its first 24 hours. In less than a month, it has managed to double that number. Insomniac isn't done with the IP yet, and a patch has been recently released to fix minor performance issues. There has also been mention of a potential Venom spin-off, depending on what fans want. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\nSony's first-party titles are performing well\n\n\nThe announcement was posted on Twitter, though a more detailed second-quarter financial report gives more details regarding the performance of Sony's gaming division. Spider-Man 2 isn't the only game under Sony's umbrella doing impressive numbers. \n\n\nThe report reveals God of War Ragnarok has sold 11 million copies, while Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart has sold 1.1 million units. We also learn that the PS5 has sold 4.9 million units in the last quarter, bringing the console's lifetime sales to a little over 46 million units. \n\n\nSpider-Man 2 has been a boon for Sony and there'll be plenty more content next year for fans, as the Kraven the Hunter movie and an untitled Venom movie are scheduled for 2024.\n\nThe post Spider-Man 2 has already sold over 5 million copies appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "What's in a name? There are a lot of video game titles that just evoke memories or conjure up the idea of quality. Half-Life is just one example. However, Valve's first-ever game could easily have been called something else.\n\n\nIn a recent YouTube video from Valve level designer Dario Casali, it turns out Half-Life nearly wasn't called Half-Life at all. Casali begins his developer commentary – as part of the game's 25th anniversary celebrations – by showing a list of names that were suggested.\n\n\n\n\nOf the most popular ones, titles like \"Dirt,\" \"Lead,\" \"Pressure Chamber,\" \"Screwed,\" and even \"Bent\" were bandied around. Perhaps most interestingly, in a runners-up list, the word \"Fallout\" can be seen, along with \"Adrenaline,\" \"Unstable Element,\" and even just \"Death.\"\n\n\nWould have been a bit confusing\n\n\nWhat's also intriguing is that Half-Life is on this lower list, suggesting that it wasn't even a popular name being suggested. As a side note, Casali believes the team should have called it Screwed, adding that \"it would have been amazing.\"\n\n\nIt also would have been interesting if the studio had gone with Fallout. Considering the actual Fallout game came out a year before HL, there's a good chance there would have been some issues. Or at least some confusion.\n\n\nThe rest of this opening chapter of Casali's playthrough is pretty good as well. He gives a bit of insight into what the purpose of the iconic monorail opening was, aside from setting the scene. We take it for granted these days, but Valve really wanted to show off new technologies, such as light shafts, scripted sequences, and new skeletal models, and this intro was a way to show these things off.\n\nThe post Fun fact: Half-Life could well have been called ‘Fallout’ at one point appeared first on Destructoid.",

There's a distinct possibility that the Valve client could introduce a feature that will allow you to hide some of your more embarrassing choices.\n\n\nThat's according to a screenshot from SteamDB creator Pavel Djundik. The image shows a drop-down menu in Steam with an option to select \"Mark as Private.\" With such a feature, I can finally download Hatoful Boyfriend without fear of reprisal.\n\n\n\n\nOf course, it should be mentioned that, at the time of writing, this has yet to be confirmed. However, given that this comes from SteamDB – a third-party site that chronicles all things related to Steam – I'm hopeful it will come to fruition.\n\n\nNot here to judge\n\n\nThere are some, shall we say, less-than-chaste video games available through Steam's vast library of choices. As such, it seems pretty clear that the (potential) ability to hide certain ones from your friends is almost certainly motivated by the same reason Microsoft created an option to hide files and folders on Windows.\n\n\nThere is, after all, an Adults Only tag in the client, so it's not exactly a stretch to assume that – were such a feature to be implemented – there may be an uptick in people less shy about purchasing games of this nature. Whether it would also disable the pop-up that lets your friends know what you've just booted up remains to be seen.\n\n\nAs the head honcho of modern PC gaming, Steam is consistently being updated with everything from small backend tweaks to substantial UI overhauls. As such, some might argue that a \"porn hider\" is long overdue.\n\nThe post Steam may soon allow you to hide games from your friends appeared first on Destructoid.",

Side-scrolling shoot 'em up Valfaris: Mecha Therion is coming to PC on November 21, 2023, with consoles to follow later. \n\n\nDeveloper Steel Mantis is doing the best thing you can do to a protagonist with this one: Give them a massive robot. The story of Valfaris: Mecha Therion is pretty much covered in the subtitle. Therion continues his hunt for the evil Lord Vroll, only this time he takes the opportunity to bust out the secret weapon known as Mecha Therion. Thus, the follow-up is ready to fire away with a move from hectic, Contra-esque running and gunning to pure shooting action. \n\n\nYou can see how they changed things as Therion suits up in the release date trailer:\n\n\n\n\nIf the mighty sword he wields wasn't enough of a hint, there are still melee moves to master. Mecha Therion has Melee, Ballistic, and Destroyer class weapons, and your loadout can be configured with a variety of weapon combinations. Further add-ons and weapon upgrades are acquired by earning Blood Metal. \n\n\nIf the actual lore of Valfaris is something you can't resist, publisher Big Sugar Games promises a \"deeper dive\" in the days leading up to this month's launch. After its arrival on PC, Valfaris: Mecha Therion will make its way to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch sometime in 2024.  \n\nThe post Shoot ’em up sequel Valfaris: Mecha Therion hits PC this month, consoles in 2024 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Gearbox Publishing celebrated 10 years of Risk of Rain today with an announcement for Risk of Rain: Hostile Worlds, a free-to-play action RPG roguelike for mobile devices.\n\n\nThe game looks to bring the usual fast-paced, run-and-gun combat of Risk of Rain to a new perspective. Hostile Worlds uses an isometric camera to display the action. The mobile RPG also embraces the new changes visually, showcasing a more cartoon-ish style with chibi-esque Survivors and perhaps even animated cutscenes. Gearbox notes that Hostile Worlds includes a lot of familiar characters and foes while staying true to the series' lore.\n\n\n\n\nRisk of Rain mobile charges into battle with more Survivors\n\n\nBeyond the look and new angle, the big takeaway is that this mobile Risk of Rain will let you swap characters on the fly. The game lets you pick three Survivors you can change while in \"mid-combat to exploit enemy vulnerabilities.\" It sounds like your odds of survival will only improve by unlocking the best Survivors who complement your team's playstyle. There will also be co-op support for you and up to three others. \n\n\nBut even that might not help. The publisher promises that Risk of Rain: Hostile Worlds will still be pretty tough with \"heart-pounding bullet-hell gameplay\" and \"colossal adversaries.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNaturally, since this is a F2P mobile game, there will be some live-service trappings. Neither Gearbox nor developer Frima Games makes mention of what their free-to-play model looks like yet. But the game will feature \"continuous\" updates to keep \"the fun rolling.\" I expect we'll see new Survivors and items getting piped into some in-game store. Gearbox hasn't yet revealed any costs, and the game's release date is still up in the air.\n\n\nThere is a website, though, and signing up for the newsletter will unlock a Survivor called Mercenary during the game's launch. Risk of Rain: Hostile Worlds will be available on iOS and Android mobile devices.\n\nThe post Risk of Rain is getting an F2P action RPG on mobile appeared first on Destructoid.",

Thankfully, the latest update for Marvel's Spider-Man 2 fixes some troublesome clipping issues and a bug that could corrupt your save file.\n\n\nThe latter issue is clearly the larger concern. Thankfully, according to the notes released by developer Insomniac Games, the bug appears only in a very specific situation. And there's only one such bug listed with the update. A majority of the fixes cover collision problems, getting stuck on objects, or clipping through or into things. For some, Spider-Man would warp through the ground like Nightcrawler and fall forever into the screaming void. The patch should hopefully fix it. Hopefully.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nSpider-Man 2 update fixes the infamous 'Spider-Box' once again\n\n\nThe Spider-Man 2 update includes five fixes for clipping issues. It addresses situations where you can get stuck while running on a wall or clip through the world while in combat. There's also a fix for one issue that I had to deal with. While playing the Coney Island story mission, I had Peter Parker sit on a bench that must have been coated with glue. He wouldn't stand up, and I had to restart a checkpoint. If this happened to you, the update should fix it. \n\n\nThe patch also corrects the model-loading issue, of which the character turns into a white box. And if you've checked the game's subreddit, the bug is not as uncommon as you'd think. It may have even happened once to yours truly. \n\n\nI had fun with it. Screenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThere are other issues addressed by the update. Missions should no longer randomly fail if you have the HUD removed. The game should also count the number of correct flips if you're going for the Hang Ten trophy.

          "description": "To encourage inactive players to return to Final Fantasy XIV, Square Enix is hosting a Callback Campaign again. These occur now and again as an incentive for any who bounced off to return with encouragement from friends. This one begins today, November 8, and ends on December 14, 2023.\n\n\nIn FFXIV, Callback Campaigns work by having an active player invite a friend to return. These can be anyone from a free company or a player on the friends list. \n\n\nAssuming the invited player accepts the invitation and returns, both parties receive a few benefits. Players who send the invitation receive five Gold Chocobo Feathers. Players use these to obtain dyes and mounts like the dragon Twintania. \n\n\nThose who return to Eorzea play free for 14 days and also receive 99 Aetheryte Tickets for free fast travel. They also get 10 Silver Chocobo Feathers, which are good to exchange for two pieces of new gear. \n\n\nSome restrictions do apply. The most notable is that lapsed players need to be inactive for 90 days. Another is that players sending invitations can only receive their reward once, meaning even if multiple friends accept an invitation, the sender still only receives five Gold Chocobo Feathers. Square Enix even recommends participating in other programs to gain more feathers. \n\n\nFor anyone who has an active FFXIV membership and wants an old friend to return, this could be a good incentive, especially with some additional rewards. Two free weeks to catch up with FFXIV's patch content also doesn't sound like a bad deal for lapsed players because while FFXIV is wonderful, subscription fees add up over time. \n\n\nIt's why, despite loving the MMO, I haven't played for roughly two years.

It's yellow, it's cute, and it'll fit around a cup. You also get the satisfaction of knowing that it's not random big box store Pikachu merch, because this rat even has a hat; and there's magnifying glass/lightbulb imagery to let you know that the cozy is from Detective Pikachu.\n\n\nHere are all the details we have from Nintendo:\n\n\n\n\"Everyone knows that Detective Pikachu loves coffee—now he can keep yours warm (or cold!) with this adorable Detective Pikachu Returns Cup Cozy.

          "description": "Citing sources close to the studio, Video Games Chronicle has reported that Timesplitters developer Free Radical is facing closure by Embracer Group.\n\n\nThe original Free Radical filed for bankruptcy in 2008 after the cancelation of Star Wars: Battlefront III and a failed bid at a Goldeneye 007 remake for Activision. The remains of the studio were bought up by Crytek, rebranded Crytek UK, and the staff went to support some of that developer’s games, such as the Crysis series and Warface. During this time, a lot of the staff reportedly left the studio. Most of the remaining staff was later transferred to Dambuster Studios under Deep Silver, where they worked on Homefront: The Revolution and Dead Island 2.\n\n\nIn 2021, Deep Silver (a subsidiary of Plaion and Embracer Group) reformed Free Radical with some of the key staff returning, including Steve Ellis and David Doak. The intention was for them to revive the Timesplitters series.\n\n\nAccording to Video Games Chronicle, Embracer and Plaion “must consult employees for a minimum of 30 days before making any redundancies, including exploring ways of avoiding them.” This means that the studio could remain open, but as VGC initially reported, many key staff are currently looking for work.\n\n\nIf the closure of Free Radical goes through (and it looks like it will), this will be another in a long line of closures and layoffs for Embracer Group. This follows the loss of a potential $2 billion investment that reportedly fell through earlier this year. It’s been really painful to see so many losses due to the failures of an overly optimistic, expansion-hungry corporation.\n\n\nBeyond Embracer Group, many other companies have been laying off huge portions of their staff, including Epic Games and Ubisoft. It’s not a fun time to be covering this industry, let alone working in it.\n\nThe post Timesplitters developer Free Radical could reportedly face closure by Embracer Group appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "There was a time when Valve could do no wrong, releasing hit game after hit game. While better known these days as the developer behind Steam, Gabe Newell and his crew got their start with the iconic Half-Life. Now, an update has been sighted, and the timing is quite suspicious.\n\n\nAccording to SteamDB (as spotted by PCGamesN), the original Half-Life underwent a few changes days ago. Specifically, Valve added several depots, including one for Linux and macOS, as well as for some languages, such as Spanish, German, and Korean. \n\n\nScreenshot via Destructoid\n\n\nThere's also a \"buildid\" that's been added, which could be in reference to a new build of the game itself. Clicking on each depot reveals a list of files, but the majority of people probably won't be able to ascertain what a lot of it means (myself included). It's been years since the game's last update, but considering its age, there's probably not much to do. \n\n\nNo, it's probably not Half-Life 3\n\n\nGiven that Half-Life is approaching its 25th anniversary, there's a possibility that Valve is getting ready to release an update for its maiden game. What that entails, we can't say at this stage.\n\n\nWe know that an RTX version of Half-Life 2 is in the works, so maybe the OG is getting similar treatment. Given its legendary status, the 1998 (November 19, to be specific) release has left quite the impact on the FPS genre, shaking things up a bit with its world building and environmental storytelling.\n\n\nHard to imagine that it's been around for nearly a quarter of a century. But it's definitely nice to see that it's still getting a lot of love and attention.\n\nThe post Half-Life gets mysterious update ahead of its 25th anniversary appeared first on Destructoid.",

Now it's Chucky's turn, as the latest reveal trailer shows the killer doll from the Child's Play films will make his way to Behaviour Interactive's asymmetrical horror title.\n\n\nThe trailer reveal comes courtesy of IGN, which states Chucky becomes another Dead by Daylight fixture on November 28. Suffice it to say, he'll be a playable Killer, in case anyone was wondering. It also appears as though you'll be able to customize the character \"with the Good Gal outfit, inspired by Tiffany Valentine (aka the Bride of Chucky), which is voiced by Jennifer Tilly.\"\n\n\n\n\nOn top of that, actor Brad Dourif will reprise his role, because, quite frankly, is there anyone else up to the task? Sure, Mark Hamill did a passable job in the rebooted movie, but no one comes close to Dourif.\n\n\nProbably won't be able to possess anyone, though\n\n\nSome skills Chucky will possess include being able to sneak around the maps and the ability to \"lunge at his larger would-be victims.\" He can also be assisted by the ghost of Charles Lee Ray, Chucky's human form, before his soul got transferred into the doll. Early patch notes for the game's PTB servers are already live, too. \n\n\nThe brainchild of screenwriter Don Mancini, Child's Play brought the world the violent little doll with adorable dungarees and a penchant for murder. The franchise has enjoyed lucrative success over the years, albeit less so with subsequent entries.\n\n\nAs for Dead by Daylight, the survival horror game has certainly carved out a niche for itself by adding in monsters and characters from famous franchises. It'll be interesting to see whether they'll add Andy Barclay (the first Child's Play film) to counter Chucky.\n\nThe post Chucky is coming to Dead by Daylight this month appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Movie Games and Vaporware have released the neon-soaked FPS Beyond Sunset into Steam Early Access today. It’s expected to stay there for six months before its full release.\n\n\nBeyond Sunset is part of an oncoming wave of first-person shooters built in the GZDoom Engine (an expanded source port of the engine that 1993’s Doom was built on), including Supplice and Selaco. It bills itself as a cyberpunk shooter with “a rich story and RPG elements.” You play as a woman with incredible abilities and no memory. Another woman promises to give your memories back if you kick some ass.\n\n\nI’m so tired of amnesiac protagonists. But aside from that, Beyond Sunset has lived on my wishlist for a while now, so I’m definitely going to check it out. It looks pretty fab with its lo-fi aesthetics injected with neon. I love raycasting. I deal with 3D constantly, and 2D games are rife in the indie and small-budget spheres, so I appreciate it when a game gives me 2.5D.\n\n\n\n\nThe RPG elements include side-quests and ability upgrades. It also features a soundtrack provided by Karl Vincent, who is touted as a “synthwave legend.” I’m going to have to take their word for it. Beyond Sunset also touts its modability, which I think is sort of a given considering its open-source engine.\n\n\nBeyond Sunset is available now in Steam Early Access. Vaporware is planning to have its full release in six months. The Early Access FAQ states that the current state of the game is “mostly finished – only minor tweaks and polishes are left.”\n\nThe post GZDoom FPS Beyond Sunset begins its Early Access stint today appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "[Update: Rockstar's Sam Houser has confirmed that a trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto game will be released in December. The original story follows after the below tweet.]\n\n\n\n\nBloomberg's Jason Schreier reports that a Grand Theft Auto 6 announcement could be coming as early as this week, according to his sources. \n\n\nSchreier's sources also tell him that a trailer is scheduled for December, to coincide with Rockstar's 25th anniversary. As one of the most anticipated games, anticipation is high for Rockstar to finally unveil the next chapter of the massive franchise.\n\n\nFor years there has been a flood of GTA 6 rumors, with nearly all proving to be false. However, due to Schreier's track record, this claim holds a little more weight. Schreier had also previously reported that the upcoming game will feature a Latina protagonist which aligned with what we eventually saw in the colossal 2022 leak.\n\n\nImage via Rockstar.\n\n\nThe long wait for Grand Theft Auto VI\n\n\nThe gap between GTA 5 and its successor is the biggest in the franchise, with the game being originally released on the PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2013. During this time, it's had several re-releases, including a remaster for current-gen consoles. We got our first official mention of the successor in February 2022, and since then, reports from Schreier have claimed that we'll be heading back to Vice City in the next installment. \n\n\nIt is hard to predict what the upcoming game will look and feel like, as there have been significant changes at Rockstar since GTA 5. Most notably, Dan Houser has left the studio, and there have also been reports of a cultural change at the studio as it aims to shed its old fratboy ways. \n\n\nPrior reports claim that the upcoming game could launch in 2025, though we will have to wait for official word from Rockstar before marking our calendars. \n\nThe post GTA VI announcement coming in December, Rockstar says appeared first on Destructoid.",

Nintendo notes that the Switch will turn 8 years old in March 2024, but this won't mark the end of the console's life. Instead, the company will continue to develop new titles for it without being bound by traditional platform cycles, according to Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa.\n\n\nCompared to current-gen consoles, the Switch remains woefully underpowered. Despite this, it continues to sell like hotcakes, with it moving 132.46 million units globally. Furukawa's comments suggest that even if a Switch successor comes next year or in 2025, we'll still be getting games for the current hybrid console. \n\n\nThere are a few ways to interpret the comments. They could be an indication that the next generation will live alongside the Switch. The comments also reveal that Nintendo believes the hybrid console has a lot more to give.\n\n\nWe also get some updates on some of Nintendo's most profitable franchises. Super Mario Bros. Wonder has sold 4.3 million copies within two weeks of launch, making it the best-performing Super Mario title. The game has managed to reach these heights with some help from the Super Mario Bros.

The nominations reveal for The Game Awards, happening on December 7, will occur on Monday, November 13, with tickets available now.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Geoff's tweet, over 30 categories will be announced, including the highly-anticipated Game of the Year. This year has seen many acclaimed games, with titles such as The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kigndom, Baldur's Gate III, and Alan Wake 2 making big waves. Last year, the Game of the Year went to FromSoftware's Elden Ring. It'll be interesting to see what gets nominated this year, as well as what dark horses and snubs may appear, much like years past.\n\n\nFor those who want to experience the show in-person, tickets are now available for purchase. The event will take place at the Peacock Theater. Previous years had the show at Microsoft Theater, but no reason was given for the new location. Ticket prices range from $81 to $181, depending on where you choose to sit in the Orchestra section.\n\n\nStarting in 2014, The Game Awards, created by Geoff Keighley, is in its 10th year. While the event did exist prior in the form of 2013's VGX and Spike Video Game Awards, the show was a little loose with its presentation. In years since, The Game Awards have become a bit more prestigious, and now loosely resembles other music and movie award shows. \n\n\nStill, expect many big announcements, much like years prior.

More than a million players have tested the game and seem to like what they've experienced. The Anacrusis has managed to maintain a 'Mostly Positive' rating on Steam. It's a more optimistic response than other games that have aped the legendary zombie co-op game. \n\n\nImage via Stray Bombay\n\n\nIt's like Left 4 Dead with a retro vibe and aliens\n\n\nIn case you're not up to date and your eyes glossed over while reading the prior paragraph, The Anacrusis is a first-person co-op game akin to Left 4 Dead and Vermintide. The former makes sense as the studio was co-founded by Chet Faliszek, a former Valve writer who worked on the original L4D games. \n\n\nThe Anacrusis doesn't shy away from its inspiration. Like L4D, a team of up to four players gets together to shoot their way through multiple stages. The game also includes an AI Director that keeps an eye on players and their progress, altering things like ammo or weapon spawns. If you're doing too well, then the Director may try to knock you down a peg.\n\n\nThe Anacrusis isn't a carbon copy of its spiritual predecessor, though. It rocks a retro '70s vibe and some kitschy flair with occasionally salmon-colored environments and weaponry. You also fight against hoards of aliens, as opposed to infected, taken, Ridden, or whatever the hell else we want to call zombies these days. \n\n\nImage via Stray Bombay\n\n\nConsidering its pedigree and the surrounding early praise, The Anacrusis may be the L4D-style game to try when it launches out of Early Access in December.

          "description": "We’ll be getting a deeper look at the future of Playdate in an upcoming live stream. The company announced that it will be hosting a 12 minute showcase via YouTube on November 8 at 9a.m. PST. \n\n\nThe showcase is set to introduce developers working on the next slate of Playdate games and to offer some insight into “more fun stuff on the horizon.” In a follow-up message, Playdate teased what that fun stuff might look like. The company wrote, “No big hardware news, but keep an eye out for something blue & new.”\n\n\nImage via Panic\n\n\nSave the date\n\n\nPlaydate was first announced back in 2019, and the little handheld console made its way into gamers' hands for the first time in April 2022. The console’s games follow a bit of a strange release schedule. The first “season” contains 24 different games, which become available two-per-week after you first get your device. Those are the flagship titles, and other games can be bought through Playdate's Catalog service or sideloaded onto the device.\n\n\nThanks in part to the handheld’s unique approach, Playdate has skyrocketed in popularity. A year after its launch Playdate had sold over 50,000 units. That’s more than double what developer Panic had projected and orders were backlogged into late 2023. Currently it’s possible to pre-order a Playdate for when the next batch of devices arrives. \n\n\nThe November 8 showcase could shed some light on when Playdate will be more readily available. It will also finally give owners and people with a pre-order waiting in the wings a peek at what Playdate’s second season of games will look like. \n\nThe post A new Playdate update airs soon appeared first on Destructoid.",

Ball's previous work includes The Maze Runner theatrical adaptations, as well as the upcoming Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes.\n\n\nThe live-action Zelda film will be co-financed by Nintendo and Sony, with the former covering over half. Worldwide distribution will be handled by Sony Pictures Entertainment. And notably, Nintendo is developing the picture themselves.\n\n\n\"By producing visual contents of Nintendo IP by itself, Nintendo is creating new opportunities to have people from around the world to access the world of entertainment which Nintendo has built, through different means apart from its dedicated game consoles,\" reads today's statement.\n\n\nNintendo's cinematic universe\n\n\nAfter the runaway success of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, it was easy to speculate over which Nintendo property might see its next film adaptation. After all, video games are big in the adaptation field right now, whether it's on the silver screen or at-home streaming.\n\n\nA live-action adaptation direction is an interesting one, though. The adventures of Link and Zelda certainly seem ripe for cinema. But whether this will be an adaptation of a game or, more likely, an amalgamation of ideas into a new-but-familiar narrative, remains to be seen.\n\n\nStill, it somehow means that we are, indeed, getting a Legend of Zelda film.

Oh, and apparently it fixes that one annoying problem that seemingly keeps coming back. \n\n\nThe latest update is on the smaller side, but it's likely a welcome sight for anybody stuck due to a bug. Last week's update brought a whopping 200 improvements and fixes to the game, covering everything from lip-syncing to overall polish. However, there was one that came back — ironically enough, just like an echo. \n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Alan Wake 2 update fixes Hotel progress-halting issues again (maybe)\n\n\nThe last patch attempted to fix an Echo not aligning correctly in the Oceanview Hotel Lobby. Remedy itself called it \"annoying\" while issuing an apology. The bug has been a hard one to squash and is addressed once more in the new patch. Remedy writes that it was \"fixed in the previous update, but Echo hell still persisted.\" \n\n\nHere are the patch notes via Remedy:\n\n\n\nXbox Series\n\nA workaround fix for the issue where the audio cut out intermittently in the Prologue. We are expecting a full fix for this issue in an upcoming update.\n\n\n\n\nROOM 665\n\nFixed an issue (again) with the Echo scene not aligning and unlocking correctly (this was fixed in the previous update, but Echo hell still persisted)  \n\n\n\n\nLOCAL GIRL\n\nFixed an issue with a mouse (with a big presence) blocking progress.\n\n\n\n\n\nHopefully, Remedy managed to slay the Echo dragon once and for all. Of course, we'll know for sure when the next update rolls our way.\n\n\nRemedy is also working on an update that will add New Game Plus mode to Alan Wake 2. There is no solid release date for it, but the mode will add new Manuscript pages and video content to slightly alter the narrative. \n\nThe post Alan Wake 2 update patches up a pesky Echo bug appeared first on Destructoid.",

These departures are happening across several of its departments, including many at its Canadian offices.\n\n\nThe layoffs are hitting a variety of departments at Ubisoft, including some administrative teams, Ubisoft IT, and Hybride, the company’s SFX studio. In a statement to Kotaku, the company explained the reasoning behind the move. \n\n\n“Ubisoft is proceeding with a collective dismissal in its Montreal establishment within the framework of a reorganization of its production support services across Canada, by consolidating these functions Canada wide, Ubisoft will be able to optimize its resources to be more sustainable in the long term.” \n\n\nThe company also said it is “providing comprehensive support for our colleagues who will be leaving Ubisoft during this transition” and emphasized that the current restructuring won’t have an effect on its production teams. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\nDéjà vu\n\n\nUbisoft as a whole has been facing challenges lately. Lengthy delays for games like Beyond Good and Evil 2 and xDefiant have undoubtedly affected the company. Just this May, Ubisoft let go dozens of employees at its North Carolina and Newcastle locations. Employees at the time said they were given no notice that they would be losing their jobs.\n\n\nSadly this is part of an ongoing trend in the gaming industry this year.  In September Epic Games cut 16% of its workforce. Just last month Naughty Dog and Telltale Games were hit by a wave of layoffs. More than a dozen different companies have faced layoffs in the back half of 2023 alone. \n\nThe post Ubisoft sees layoffs amid year full of them appeared first on Destructoid.",

As of August, Grand Theft Auto V has sold more than 185 million copies since its release 10 years ago. \nOfficial news of this trailer from the Rockstar Twitter account comes less than a day after a Bloomberg report that states Rockstar will reveal the sequel, presumably titled Grand Theft Auto VI or Grand Theft Auto 6, this week with a trailer for it arriving sometime next month; Since the release of this report yesterday, Rockstar has confirmed a trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto will, in fact, be released in December. \nWe are very excited to let you know that in early December, we will release the first trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto. We look forward to many more years of sharing these experiences with all of you.\nNovember 8, 2023\nGame Informer has reached out to Rockstar's parent company Take-Two Interactive to ask about this report and reveal and will update the story if more information is learned. \nThe journey to the reveal of the next Grand Theft Auto has not happened quietly. In September of last year, unprecedented leaks gave fans a potential look at the sequel in over 90 videos showcasing secret in-development footage of the open-world crime sequel.  We also learned last year that the game reportedly stars a female protagonist. Bloomberg says this Grand Theft Auto V sequel is set in a fictional version of Miami and features the aforementioned female protagonist as well as a male protagonist. \n\n\nWhile waiting to learn more about Rockstar's next game, read Game Informer's Grand Theft Auto V review and then read our thoughts on Red Dead Redemption II. After that, read Game Informer's ranking of every single Rockstar game. \nWhat do you want to see most in the next Grand Theft Auto? Let us know in the comments below!",

According to IGN, the company laid off a total of 124 employees. 98 of them were based in Canada, which IGN calculates as roughly 2% of the company's Canadian workforce. The cuts included administrative and IT workers, some of whom were employed at the Hybride VFX studio, a company that has worked on shows like Ahsoka and The Mandalorian.\n\n\n\"These are not decisions taken lightly and we are providing comprehensive support for our colleagues who will be leaving Ubisoft during this transition,\" the company told both IGN and Kotaku. \"We also want to share our utmost gratitude and respect for their many contributions to the company. This restructuring does not affect our production teams.\" Another quote obtained by Kotaku claims that the layoffs are to allow Ubisoft to \"to optimize its resources to be more sustainable in the long term.\"\nThis news comes after a year of several big Ubisoft releases, including Assassin's Creed Mirage, The Crew: Motorfest, and Just Dance 2024, but that's in spite of the fact that they canceled several games this year and delayed Skull and Bones... again. Unrest at the company has been ongoing as well: back in September, IGN reported widespread frustration after employees were suddenly called to return to in-person working conditions.\nUbisoft now joins Bungie, Media Molecule, Telltale Games, Team17, Epic Games, Naughty Dog, Microsoft, and more on the unfortunately long list of companies that have laid people off in the past year.\n[Sources: IGN, Kotaku]",

If you're a diehard Apple fan and have multiple RE4 Remake compatible products, you'll be happy to know that the game also supports cross-progression between Apple devices, so you can start a save file on your Mac at home and pick it up on your phone when you're on the go.\nThe game is available for pre-order on the App Store now, but players will be able to start the game for free before committing to a full purchase. Its recently released DLC, Separate Ways, will launch alongside it as well.

That means users will no longer be able to directly upload screenshots and video clips from the console to the social media site.\nAn announcement update posted to the PlayStation Support page states that on Monday, November 13, X integration will end, which includes the ability to “view any content published on X on PS5/PS4, and the ability to post and view content, trophies, and other gameplay-related activities on X directly from PS5/PS4 (or link an X account to do so).”\nWhile a bummer for those who make frequent use of this feature, which offers a simple method of posting gameplay content to the platform, there are a couple of more involved alternatives depending on your platform. If you’re a PS5 user, you can still use the PlayStation mobile app to upload gameplay captures to then post on X. You can read how to do that here. PS4 users have to rely on ShareFactory and do a bit more work, and you can read those steps here.\nMicrosoft made the same move in April by disabling sharing to X directly from the console and instructing players to instead use the Xbox app on mobile (with some speculating the decision was made to avoid paying the platform's then-new monthly application programming interface (API) fee). This now means that the Switch will become the sole console that supports direct media sharing to X. \nWhat do you think about the decision to end X integration? Did you use this feature regularly?

The Diablo team revealed this news over the weekend during BlizzCon 2023, which is also where we learned about three new World of Warcraft expansions and three new Overwatch 2 heroes coming to the game. \nDuring BlizzCon 2023, Blizzard kept Vessel of Hatred details light, stating it will share more details next summer. As for what to expect, it features a campaign that continues the dark tale that began in Diablo IV. \"Vessel of Hatred brings players back to learn the fate of the prime evil Mephisto and his demonic plans for Sanctuary,\" a press release reads. \"Travel to the lush jungles known by the locals as Nahantu.\" \nCheck out the Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred expansion announcement trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nBlizzard says Vessel of Hatred will allow players to traverse an exotic new region, vanquish new evils, and perhaps most excitingly, explore fresh ways to kill demons and loot chests with a completely new Class \"never seen before in the Diablo universe.\" \nAnd that's all Blizzard shared about Vessel of Hatred. Diablo IV's first expansion is due out in late 2024. \nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Diablo IV review and then check out this story about how Diablo IV (and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III) won't be coming to Xbox Game Pass this year, even though Xbox now owns Activision Blizzard.

Plus, the Overwatch 2 team teased a new DPS hero and Support hero hitting the roster sometime down the line. \nMauga was actually playable for free as a part of a limited-time trial run for the tank hero this past weekend, but he's already out of the game; his real debut happens alongside Overwatch 2's Season 8 launch on December 5. \"Equipped with two chain guns (Gunny and Cha-Cha), Mauga is ready to bash through the front lines of his opponents and tear through anyone that stands in his way with tons of fire-power,\" Blizzard says about the hero. \nWatch the official Mauga gameplay trailer below: \n\n\nHere are some additional Mauga screens from Overwatch 2: \n\nElsewhere during the Overwatch 2 BlizzCon 2023 presentation, which is where Mauga was revealed, Blizzard pulled back the curtains on two more heroes coming to the game sometime in the future. The first is a DPS hero named Venture, with a unique Splatoon-ish weapon: \nThe second is a new support hero codenamed Space Ranger, and given this hero does not yet have an official title, it's the hero we're expecting to debut in Overwatch 2 last out of these new ones. \nThe final piece of Overwatch 2 from BlizzCon 2023 is Clash, a new PvP mode where two teams are tasked with capturing five distinct points on a map. Perhaps most excitingly, Blizzard is bringing back Overwatch map Hanamura as playable in Clash, except under the new name Hanaoka. Here's a look at Hanaoka below: \nFor more about BlizzCon 2023, read about the three World of Warcraft expansions announced during the event.

Humanity's story reflects real-world events, showing us the paths we're currently on.\nWatch The Documentary:\n\n\n\"Soon after we began making Humanity, a number of big events and movements broke out around the world,\" Enhance founder and CEO Tetsuya Mizuguchi tells us. \"There were human rights movements, the Hong Kong protests, [and] then there was the pandemic. And war soon followed in Ukraine. We had no idea how quickly and deeply AI would infiltrate our society either. I think all these things found their way into the core of Humanity. That question, for example, 'What is humanity? What is human nature?' We would often talk about how people, looked at individually, are good. There are so many wonderful people out there. But when they become a group, or a nation, or even just big groups, at that level, something happens. It's like a different switch gets flipped. And what you see there, that is what we're trying to depict in Humanity.\"\nWatch above or over on Game Informer's YouTube channel to see the full documentary about the making of Humanity. \"Violence Is Inevitable\" speaks to the core creative team, including Mizuguchi and tha creative director Yugo Nakamura, about the project's origins, its complications and lengthy development cycle, and how it came to show us the nature of humanity.",

          "description": "Earlier this year, HBO's The Last of Us successfully brought developer Naughty Dog's critically acclaimed and fan-favorite PlayStation exclusive to life on the TV screen. Its Season 1 premiere was HBO's second-largest debut since 2010, and its second episode broke records, too. Roughly three weeks after the premiere of the series, HBO revealed The Last of Us would be getting a second season. And now, thanks to a new Deadline report, we know it will start shooting next year and premiere sometime in 2025. \nDeadline learned this at a New York news event, where HBO boss Casey Bloys reportedly told press that Season 2 will head into production early next year, aiming for a 2025 premiere. Unfortunately, that's all Bloys said about the season. But, as noted by Deadline, series co-creator and executive producer Craig Mazin revealed earlier this summer pre-strike that the team was already able to get some work done, adding that the first episode was already written. \n\n\n\"We got pretty far actually, we were doing great,\" Mazin told Deadline. \"[The Last of Us game co-creator Neil Druckmann] and I had been sitting and talking with [The Last of Us Part II co-writer Halley Gross] and Bo Shim, the new writer that was in our little tiny room with us – obviously not a mini room because we're greenlit proper, we're a real show, and because I hate that mini room stuff.\"\nConsidering the first season of The Last of Us covered the events of the first Last of Us game, including its Left Behind DLC, it's clear Season 2 of the show will dive into The Last of Us Part II. We're all still awaiting some casting announcements, like who will play Abby and Lev, but that likely won't happen until the actor and writer strikes are over. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's The Last of Us Part 1 review and then read our review of The Last of Us Part II. \n[Source: Deadline]\nHow far into The Last of Us Part II do you think Season 2 will go?

Sometimes Yoshi showed up in The Legend of Zelda, and Kirby was whatever color he felt like at the moment, be it gray or pink. In 1996, that laissez-faire attitude was in full effect for the release of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars for the Super Nintendo. Link, Samus, and even Donkey Kong (sort of) all had inexplicable cameos in the game, and one of my big questions about the remake was whether or not those would move forward. If you're ready to learn the answer for at least some of them, read on!\nImpressively, the answer is yes! At least for Link and Donkey Kong. I have not been able to play to the point in the game where Samus appears, so I can't answer that question yet. When you get close to Link after seeing him in the sleeping bed, a \"talk\" option appears, and when you click it, a Zelda musical sting plays.\nDonkey Kong's cameo has always been questionable as to whether or not it is him, as he is just labeled \"Guerilla\", but he sure looks a lot like Donkey Kong, just with a crown.\n\nThe Super Mario RPG remake releases November 17 for Nintendo Switch.\nPurchase",

It will be released as a hardcover graphic novel on April 30, 2024, in retail stores and online, for $19.99 (and it hits comic book stores on May 1, 2024). Mathieu Gabella is the author, with art from Paolo Traisci. \nThe Hidden Codex follows Edward, a scribe and reluctant monk after he escapes from a kidnapping performed by a clan of Vikings. After securing his freedom, Edward finds his brother missing and strange documents \"blackened by a language he innately understands.\" \n\"No one knows where these occult-looking symbols came from, but Edward has seen such writings before: in the workshop of an enigmatic wise man among the Vikings who is part of a secret order: Those Unseen,\" a press release reads. \"An order that could offer answers to Edward, and guarantee his aspirations of freedom and knowledge. But with that knowledge, can he find and rescue his own brother before it's too late?\"\nUbisoft senior transmedia content manager Etienne Bouvier says the company is lucky to work with Gabella and Traisci as they are two long-standing fans of the Assassin's Creed franchise who infused their love of it, and knowledge of its lore, into this book. \nAssassin's Creed Valhalla: The Hidden Codex hits bookshelves and online retailers on April 30, 2024, before it hits comic book stores on May 1.

          "description": "Gran Turismo 7 is getting its biggest update tomorrow in the form of Spec II (a.k.a update 1.40). The content drop, which is free, adds a new cooperative mode, seven new cars, a fresh track, and more.\n\n\nPerhaps the update’s biggest addition is four-player local split-screen. Unfortunately for PS4 players, this option is only available on PS5. Speaking of PS5-only features, those players can enjoy taking on Gran Turismo Sophy, which developer Polyphony Digital describes as a “prototype revolutionary racing AI agent” \nSpec II also adds the snowy Lake Louise track. Set in a Canadian ski resort, it comes in three variants: long track, short track, and tri-oval. New Master License events are coming and the update also adds quality-of-life features, such as a dashboard that tracks player progression.\nOf course, new vehicles are always exciting, and here are the seven joining the roster:\nDodge Charger R/T 426 Hemi '68\nDodge Challenger SRT Demon '18\nLexus LFA '10\nMercedes-Benz 190 E 2.5-16 Evolution II '91\nNISMO 400R '95\nPorsche 911 GT3 RS (992) '22\nTesla Model 3 Performance '23\nSpec II adds a host of smaller additions, such as new Cafe menus and new photo mode options, and you can read a complete breakdown by reading the blog post on the Gran Turismo website. You can download the update on November 2. For more on Gran Turismo 7, check out our review.",

          "description": "We are very pleased to announce today the start of the testing period of two single-game engines: Kingdom: The Far Reaches and Escape From Hell!\nKingdom, was developed and released by Interplay in 1995. Only the DOS version of the game (available on gog.com) is supported. It's a cartoon FMV game, with an inventory, in which you have to guide Lathan Kandor through a medieval world, discovering the magic spells and the items required to defeat an evil wizard. \nEscape From Hell, was developed for Electronic Arts by the game veterans Richard Seaborne and Alan Murphy and was released in 1990. You play Alan in this keyboard-only Role Playing Game and visit Hell, looking for your girlfriend who was accidentally teleported there.\nBoth games use heavily hardcoded logic which is error prone and requires a lot of testing, so we need your feedback more than ever as they are both incompletely tested. There is sadly only one known demo for Kingdom. Support for the Windows and Mac versions of Kingdom may come later! Please contact us if you have some other demos of both games.\nTo play any of these games, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker and please take some screenshots along the way!\n>",
