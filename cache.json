What's particularly interesting with this one is that developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has clearly taken inspiration from either Sonic or Marvel's 'Infinity Gauntlet' story arc, as it seems to entail a powerful artefact known as the 'Legendary Banana' which is accesible after collecting seven coloured gems.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Well, after having such a rootin'-tootin' good time with it, he's decided that the most sensible game to tackle next would be the direct sequel, The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. We wholeheartedly agree.\nUndoubtedly one of the most divisive Zelda games in the franchise, Majora's Mask is cited as either the very best that Nintendo has to offer, or derided for its polarising use of time loops. Now, we love it - obviously - but we're certainly curious to find out what Felix will think when he embarks on this journey for the very first time.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

But one Dragon Quest fan sought to preserve all DLC for the 3DS remake of Dragon Quest VII — and they did it just in time.\nGronya, a Dragon Quest enthusiast and content creator, has preserved all 56 DLC maps — known as 'tablets' in the game. These tablets are only accessible after completing the third island (at the earliest) with a handful locked to the post-game. Dragon Quest VII isn't a short RPG, so trying to power through it before downloading all of them isn't that easy.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "\"One must have good memory to keep the promises one makes\".\nFollowing a mysterious 'walking sim' path similar to those trodden by The Stanley Parable and What Remains of Edith Finch, Slovenian developer Label This' debut game, The Gap, doesn’t necessarily feel like anything revolutionary, but it’s an engaging narrative experience that we’d suggest you consider picking up.\nThe plot here places you in the role of Josh, a highly respected neuroscientist who’s struggling with his marriage and family falling apart. Josh is doggedly pursuing something he’s called “The Cure” which he believes will save his family, though all his family sees is a man increasingly consumed and isolated by his ‘research’. The thing is, Josh has seemingly discovered the multiverse and a way of jumping into neighboring realities. This has left his mind profoundly broken, unable to easily discern between memory and reality after crossing dimensions. So, you set out to put together all the pieces and try to make sense not just of where Josh has come from, but where he may go if this cure he’s been after isn’t so fictional after all.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The Drop Bear might look like a normal koala, but they’re actually dangerous predators, fond of jumping from trees to maul unsuspecting chumps who forget to take adequate precautions, like urinating on themselves. Really, the story is a wind-up the aussies like to blag tourists with. If it looks like a koala, it’s just a koala. But it’s this sort of character, inspired by love for Australia’s unique landscape, culture and good-natured mick-taking, that forms the heart of the best bits in Broken Roads. I say ‘best bits’, but I should probably say ‘the only bits that I actually enjoyed’, unfortunately.\nBombs wiped out 80% of Australia’s population, and left the remaining nail-hard Nancys and tough Tobiases to fend for themselves in a world short of resources, but shockingly plentiful in both guns and pre-made Vegemite sarnies. You’ll pick one of four character classes - I went with ‘Jackaroo’ (cattle hand), because it was called ‘Jackaroo’ - before tackling a short tutorial section. You'll then be thrust into some events, where you’ll meet the rest of your starting party and kick off the game proper.\n \nRead more",

          "description": "When Bethesda was working out how to turn their popular Elder Scrolls RPGs into an online behemoth to rival World Of Warcraft back in the late 00s, the initial pitch was \"Elder Scrolls with friends,\" creative director Rich Lambert tells me. A simple idea on paper, perhaps, but one that proved to be a lot more complicated in the realisation of it. Zenimax Online Studios was founded in 2007, a year after The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion landed to universal critical praise, but it wasn't until seven years later that The Elder Scrolls Online finally released for PC in 2014. At launch \"we were walking this weird line between 'online game' and 'Elder Scrolls game',\" Lambert says. \"We didn't do either of them particularly well.\"\nTen years later, though, The Elder Scrolls Online is thriving. At last count, the game has over 24 million players galloping about the plains of Tamriel, and later this June, it will receive its eighth major Chapter expansion, Gold Road, which adds Oblivion's West Weald to the game and wraps up the mystery of the new Daedric Prince that arrived at the end of the previous expansion, Necrom. But the path ESO has taken to get here hasn't been nearly as glittering, with its PC launch in particular generating \"a lot of feedback\", as studio director Matt Firor told press at the game's tenth anniversary event last week. In fact, it wasn't until ESO came to consoles in 2015 that the game really found its voice, says Lambert. \"We had to really figure out what we wanted to be, and we chose 'Elder Scrolls'. As soon as we hit that core pillar of 'It's Elder Scrolls first, online second,' then it really just helped inform everything we've done since.\" Trouble is, when the thrust of ESO's development straddled the launch of two very different Elder Scrolls games, even nailing down that first part of the pillar proved to be more challenging than expected.\nRead more",

But Botany Manor is much less eldritch, and much more gentle historical feel-good movie starring Emma Thompson in the lead role. That role - which in this case is played by you in first person rather than La Thompson - is of Arabella Greene, a retired botanist who, thank God, is the childless inheritor of a huge manor and ancestral wealth, and so is able to spend the sunny days of 1890 pottering around the house and grounds researching weird, slightly fantastical plants almost wholly untroubled. So in this respect it is also a fantasy game. It's quite delightful, which is the sort of phrase I am confident Arabella would use.\nRead more",

          "description": "According to one unofficial tracker created by video game artist Farhan Noor, there have been 8000 layoffs in 2024 so far, following an estimated 10,500 layoffs in 2023. The leaders of Microsoft, Embracer Group, Epic and other industry giants have made swingeing cuts to their workforces. While larger companies have inevitably seen the largest reductions, many smaller developers and publishers have also cut staff or even closed their doors. Circumstances vary by company, of course, but as regards the biggest publishers, there are some broad overlapping causes: reckless or, if you prefer, \"overambitious\" expansion and overhiring during the pandemic lockdown gaming boom; lower-than-hoped returns on new technologies and business models such as NFTs; and rising global interest rates, which have scared away potential investors.\nThe carnage was uppermost in Larian CEO's Swen Vincke's mind when he accepted Baldur's Gate 3's Best Narrative gong at the GDC Awards last month. According to Vincke, the layoffs can be traced straightforwardly to a pattern of executive greed that sees company leadership betting the livelihoods and stability of their workers on whatever new idea seems capable of delivering instant growth for shareholders.\n Read more",

Calm down and stop waving that chair. A wanzer is a mech, in short. And Front Mission, by the way, is a 90s tactical RPG series from G-Craft and Square, both of which have since been assimilated into the terrifying robot octopus that is present-day Square Enix. Much as with Final Fantasy Tactics games, Front Mission games are stagey political thrillers about countries and corporations and other factions waging perpetual war upon each other, with players thrust into the mix as mech squad leaders. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Yesterday, if you can believe it, marked the tenth anniversary of The Elder Scrolls Online. That's a whole decade of tromping across Tamriel with your mates, and a whole decade in which I've watched tentatively from the sidelines, thinking about dipping my toes into the MMO pool, but never quite building up the courage (or lining the walls of my bank account) to fully take the plunge. I've heard all the horror stories about starting a new MMO from other members of the RPS Treehouse - particularly when it comes to the lore-laden shackles of World Of Warcraft and the bloated MMO-service-hybrid Destiny - and quite honestly, it's enough to put me off them all entirely. But The Elder Scrolls Online might just be the exception to the rule.\nI spent a portion of the game's tenth birthday yesterday playing Gold Road, its upcoming eighth Chapter expansion. In it, you're whisked over to the West Weald, an autumnal, sun-dappled region whose main city hub, Skingrad, will no doubt feel familiar to seasoned Oblivionites. Seemingly overnight, a strange jungle has sprung up on the city's outskirts, uprooting the nearby villages of the neighbouring high elves and causing havoc as strange beasts pour out of its curling root beds. There are more mysteries to unravel here, too, including the emergence of the new Daedric Prince, Ithelia (revealed at the end of last year's Necrom Chapter), and much more besides - too much to realistically take in during a 90-minute preview session, or for this MMO newbie to fully comprehend the significance of. But there's something about Gold Road and its gnarled-up jungles, strange cults and fantastical beasts that's definitely made me want to make a return journey here when it launches on PC on June 3rd.\nRead more",

You can find Roblox Studios' full response over on Eurogamer.\nOriginal story\nRoblox allows its players to create and monetise their own creations within its ecosystem. Across the entire breadth of Roblox game makers, a lot of money is made. At the individual level, however, the vast majority of creators making work within Roblox never earn enough to cash out their earnings - and some of those creators are children. This has long led to allegations that Roblox is exploiting child labour, generating value for Roblox Studio and its shareholders in the process.\r\n\n\"I don't know, you can say this for a lot of things, right?\" said Roblox Studio head Stefano Corazza at GDC, when the allegation was put to him by Eurogamer. \"Like, you can say, 'Okay, we are exploiting, you know, child labour,' right? Or, you can say: we are offering people anywhere in the world the capability to get a job, and even like an income. So, I can be like 15 years old, in Indonesia, living in a slum, and then now, with just a laptop, I can create something, make money and then sustain my life.\r\n\n \nRead more",

But I am saying that if it were, it’d have my full support, because the freak deer deserves to live on forever, even as a shadow wandering a gothic purgatorial landscape in an unrelated game. \nWe got a trailer for this one a few weeks back, and the game itself just dropped on Steam yesterday. It’s got that specific blend of Hollow Knight: Silksong -esque maudlin and whimsy that I personally love, skirting around the edges of both without slipping too readily into Tim Burton territory. The artstyle is crisp and wintery, the writing is goofy, and everything that moves looks like it evolved from the same dead tree branch. Feast your hooves on the trailer below: \n \nRead more",

She'll be available to conjure by using slabs at new Summoning Altars. Be prepared for a tough fight, especially if you opt for the \"extreme\" version of the boss. Bellanoir can't be captured, but she does drop a Pal Egg on defeat.\r\n\n\r\nThis is a chunky update, with a bunch of new items and tweaks to the building system, Pal falling damage, shop prices, player drops on multiplayer servers, and the user interface - for example, you'll now see how many of a Pal you own when you aim a Palsphere at one. You can also now cancel a Pal's break simply by picking them up and throwing them at the worksite - truly, a scene from Dickens. All the new stuff is in addition to the usual bugfixes, fresh anti-cheating measures and quashing of exploits: no longer will you be able to massively increase your attack power while riding Pals under certain conditions.\r\n \nRead more",

Then, he upgraded my curiosity into attention by describing The Horror At Highrook as a “clockwork narrative” horror experience that takes inspiration from Poe, Stoker and Lovecraft on the one hand, and from boardgames, wiki-hunting and escape rooms on the other.\nThis is a heady brew indeed. Also, there appears to be a cat in the game called Mr Tubbs, described as a “portly grey barrel of fur”. I entertain suspicions of Mr Tubbs.

          "description": "The Elder Scrolls Online is the elephant in the room where discussions of The Elder Scrolls 6 are concerned, though calling it an elephant is obviously missing the opportunity for a banger lore joke – “dragon”, perhaps, or even “Numidium”? Launched back in 2014 after seven years in development, ESO's hybrid of deceptively single-player-ish Elder Scrolls presentation with MMO fixtures attracted a lukewarm response, initially. “At its best The Elder Scrolls Online looks like a faithful addition to the lore,” intoned Brendy in our own launch impressions. “At its worst it is a derivative and uninventive anachronism.”\nZeniMax Online have made big strides with the game over the years, however - binning off monthly subscriptions and introducing a “level-free” format in the One Tamriel update in 2016. ESO has also swelled and sprouted steadily as a work of geography and history, with major chapters introducing areas hitherto only mentioned in dusty collectible tomes, or creatively reintroducing locations from the single player series – the forthcoming Gold Road expansion, out in June 2024, takes us to the West Weald in Cyrodiil, an area last seen in The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion. \r\n\n \nRead more",

There's a cooking minigame in your ship's canteen which grants a health boost if you nail the timing, and sparks off a fire if you don't.\nIt's a pretty minor fire, mind you. A combusting deep dish doesn't place very highly on the list of possible ship emergencies next to, say, your reactor coughing up nuclear rods, or your engines running out of juice because some oaf hooked up too many turrets to the aforesaid reactor. But if you leave the fire unchecked, perhaps because you're busy disposing of radioactive waste or vengefully unplugging half the point defences, it'll eventually singe your ship's health to nothing - insert appropriate Steam achievement pun and/or Klingon proverb. It's an agreeable little note of idiocy in a game that takes cues from Valve's timeless anecdote generator Left 4 Dead, Sea Of Thieves, FTL and, perhaps most surprisingly, Diablo.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Whether you’re charging across its pixel-art battlefields slashing and burning increasingly tough-to-crack strongholds, or making quick decisions to get the upper hand in its tug-of-war tactics, the only times Thorald is not doing cool violence, commanding others to do cool violence, or upgrading his camps so that he may act in cooler and more violent ways, is when he’s restoring stamina with a cool slug of mead or violently gnawing at health-boosting meat.\nViking Thorald Olavson is a man possessed. A rival Jarl burnt his village and nicked his wife Raya. In his quest to find her, he’s prepared to do anything - even visit England. As Thorald, you’ll butcher your way up a chain of command in your search for Raya across six stages, each of which sits somewhere between the side-scrolling tactics of Kingdom Two Crowns, the lane strategy of a Warpips, and the slashy/blocky/shooty/dodgy of any 2D ARPG you care to name.\n \nRead more",

Says a new patch for co-op shooter Helldivers 2. You know who else enjoys basking in the pleasant glow of mildly enjoyable weather when there’s freedoms that need fighting for? Bug sympathisers, that’s who. As such, the developers have gone and added new planetary hazards in the form of blizzards and sandstorms, alongside the usual balance tweaks.\nAlongside these reminders that the war for democracy is never comfortable, the efficiently-named Patch 01.000.200 also includes a host of tweaks. Notable among these are balancing changes to the mission type ‘Retrieve Essential Personnel’, which now sounds more manageable. Enemy spawn points have been placed further away from the objective, “to give players a fairer chance of defending the location.” Additionally, fewer civilians are needed to beat the mission on higher difficulties.\n \nRead more",

          "description": "If you were at all nervous about Amazon's Fallout TV show, it sounds like you needn't be because it's getting glowing reviews across the board ahead of its debut.\n\n\nThe trailers certainly made a positive impression, and there have been enough modern video game adaptations across TV and film, such as Netflix's Arcane and Castlevania, to wash the awful taste of years of bad adaptations from our mouths. But there was still every chance Amazon would drop the ball with its take on Bethesda's post-apocalyptic RPG series.\n\n\nImage via Amazon\n\n\nFallout is set to drop all eight of its episodes later today on April 10 at 6pm PT / 9pm EDT exclusively on Amazon Prime Video (UK fans will need to wait till tomorrow on April 11), and early reviews from critics have plenty of praise for the show. IGN has gone so far as to call it \"among the best game adaptations ever made\" alongside HBO's The Last of Us, while Dexerto described it as \"confident\" and \"impressive.\"\n\n\nGameSpot's review isn't as overwhelmingly positive, calling the show's take on Fallout's wasteland setting \"thin and unmemorable,\" but it otherwise complimented the compelling characters and strong performances from the main cast. Polygon, meanwhile, has said the show feels more like a sequel than an adaptation; one that adds to the Fallout franchise and builds on its world while still being rooted in its \"signature so-dark-you-have-to-laugh tone.\" As such, you can expect the show to very much match the vibes of the games, with Windows Central highlighting a \"fittingly somber\" soundtrack, complete with \"old-timey licensed tracks.\"\n\n\nNot every review has been as glowing, but that hasn't held Fallout back from scoring 93% on Rotten Tomatoes at the time of writing. Amazon is also clearly confident the series will do well considering, on April 8, a Variety report revealed Fallout's already been renewed for a second season, and will be filmed in California.\n\nThe post First Fallout reviews say it’s one of ‘the best game adaptations ever made’ appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Somebody's in a hurry to get to the end of the world. Blizzard has announced the release schedule for World of Warcraft Classic: Cataclysm and, as you can see from the dates below, we're putting the end of the world (of Warcraft) on the fast track. \n\n\nThe pre-patch releases on April 30 and the full expansion launches on May 20. The final patch for the expansion will go live only 8 months later. The previous WoW Classic expansions have each lasted about two years, mirroring the original releases.\n\n\n\n\nThe obvious first impression is that this is sped up because people didn't really like Cataclysm. I don't think that's as accurate as some YouTubers would have you believe, but it was the first time people started to turn on World of Warcraft. For my money, Cataclysm was a good time and a fascinating look at what it takes to re-do a world as vast as Azeroth.\n\n\nIt's more likely that Cataclysm is \"too new.\" Everyone can agree that the \"classic\" era of WoW was up through Wrath of the Lich King. That was the better time to revel in the nostalgia, and to make sure everything was done right. Now, we're just having a fun time revisiting other previous expansions, and this version of the game is more in-line with the current one. There's really no reason to linger any longer than a year.\n\n\nThat's okay. This just means we're even closer to Mists of Pandaria Classic than I had hoped!\n\nThe post WoW Cataclysm Classic gets a launch date and speedy roadmap appeared first on Destructoid.",

That's because, in more ways than one, it's a higher-grade, higher-quality repeat of the same concept at its very core.\n\n\nIndeed, we did discuss this already from a more practical point of view, when thinking about the gear, goodies, and Stratagems that may drop into Helldivers 2 at some point in time, and which were present in the original game.

          "description": "Did you know Helldivers 2 nearly had a freestyle rap number in its introductory cutscene? Well, you can finally see it for yourself thanks to a behind-the-scenes video on the intro's creation.\n\n\nThe video was published to YouTube on April 9 by Goodbye Kansas Studios, a VFX and animation studio that's worked on plenty of other video games, including Alan Wake 2 and The Outer Worlds, as well as some big name TV shows like Netflix's live-action One Piece.\n\n\n\n\nGoodbye Kansas Studios is who you need to thank for Helldivers 2's fantastic intro, which serves as an in-universe recruitment video for joining the war effort and perfectly sets the tongue-in-cheek tone of the game. While its behind-the-scenes look doesn't go into too much detail on how the intro was made, it caps off with an almost out-of-nowhere rap number by a trio of Helldivers. The animation obviously isn't complete, with it missing textures, and the rap itself is very short, but it's so charming and cheesy that you'd wish it was included in the game.\n\n\nIn case you weren't aware, Craig Lee Thomas, the actor from Helldivers 2's intro, revealed in a PC Gamer interview in March that he had filmed \"hours of improv\" during his filming sessions. This included the aforementioned rap number, which was apparently cinematic director Fredrik Lofberg's idea and something Thomas was asked to do midway through a take.\n\n\nFrankly, it seemed likely this would remain locked on a hard drive somewhere, never to see the light of day, so consider yourself lucky that it made its way online after all. Maybe it'll become a new anthem for players as they dive into battles against the Automaton forces, which have quickly returned after they were seemingly eradicated.\n\nThe post Helldivers 2 behind-the-scenes video showcases the intro’s lost rap number appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, this Razorback may be the next dominant force, especially on Rebirth Island, as shown by FaZe Swagg. \n\n\n\n\n\"This genuinely had negative recoil. Shoots so straight,\" the 27-year-old confirmed, before revealing the class setup he was using to drop 27 kills in a victory for his squad. \n\n\nFaZe Swagg's \"zero kick\" Razorback Warzone loadout\n\n\n\nMuzzle: Casus Brake\n\n\nBarrel: 16\" TANKR-V\n\n\nUnderbarrel: Bruen Heavy Support\n\n\nMagazine: 60 Round Mag\n\n\nOptic: Glassless Optic\n\n\n\nAfter trying this loadout for myself, I have to say, he's definitely right about the recoil. Shooting this thing feels like firing a laser, and even at long-range I found that I was consistently hitting shots. Personally, I love the Glassless Optic too, as it takes me back to the Advanced Warfare days, but I tried a couple of different scopes on it and they all work, so pick whichever you prefer. \n\n\nTo be honest though, I wouldn't be inclined to use it at the moment if you do have that Renetti Conversion Kit, as it's just so overpowered that you're putting yourself at a distinct disadvantage if you're not using it. As nice as the Razorback is, the Renetti just melts at close range, and on Rebirth Island, that is so important. \n\n\nStill, we do know that the Renetti is getting a nerf in the near future, I think this loadout's lack of recoil could see it emerge as the new meta weapon when that happens. It could be worth levelling up the Razorback with the future in mind. \n\nThe post This ‘zero recoil’ Razorback Warzone loadout could replace the Renetti on Rebirth Island appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Many Pokémon Go events boost the chances of obtaining Shiny creatures to help trainers complete their collection. One, in particular, is the Shiny Croagunk, a Poison and Fighting Type that doesn't appear too often. We're here to get you one step closer to this Pokémon by giving you the latest details on its whereabouts. \n\n\nWhere to find Shiny Croagunk in Pokémon Go\n\n\nThe Shiny Croagunk can be captured during its Spotlight Hour, set for April 9 from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. local time. Croagunks appear more frequently throughout this short duration, giving you some time to capture a lot of them. The event starts just after Sizeable Surprises and provides double Evolution XP for the creature.\n\n\nIf you aren't successful with its capture during the Spotlight Hour, try the following methods to get a Shiny Croagunk in Pokémon Go:\n\n\n\nComplete Field Research tasks\n\n\nFight in Raids\n\n\nUse Lure Modules or Incense\n\n\nHatch eggs\n\n\nUse Cloudy Weather Boost\n\n\nCapture during special events\n\n\n\nWhile the Spotlight Hour is probably the best route for the Shiny Croagunk, it's still possible to find it outside of the duration. Croagunks tend to spawn during cloudy weather, so look out for these boosts to better your chances. Occasionally, the Pokémon appears for battles, but it all depends on the current Raid schedule. \n\n\nOther events, like Season of Go and Fashion Week, have included a Shiny Croagunk in their lineup. These celebrations typically last longer, providing trainers much more time than the limited Spotlight Hour. \n\n\nImage via Niantic\n\n\nKeep in mind that the Shiny rates for Croagunk are fairly low, with a one-in-500 chance. Again, if you want to increase your chances, your best bet is the Spotlight Hour or a possible Pokémon Go Community Day event. Once Croagunk Spotlight Hour is up, more critters, such as Trubbish, Clefairy, and Weedle, will take over the spot shortly after. \n\nThe post How to get Shiny Croagunk in Pokémon Go appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Renetti currently dominates Warzone's short-range meta in Season 3, but Raven Software plans to end that brief reign of terror. \n\n\nOn April 9, Warzone and Modern Warfare 3 received minor updates, addressing a few bugs and weapon balancing issues. In Warzone, the devs made minor tweaks to the FJX Horus, MORS, and TAQ Evolvere, but community members expected a Renetti nerf as well. Raven Software heard the pushback and responded, \"We are working on adjustments to the Renetti which will be released in the near future.\"\n\n\nA nerf for the Renetti was long overdue. Image via Activision\n\n\nAs part of the Season 3 update, the RAM-9 had its damage and sprint-to-fire values nerfed, leading to players annointing the HRM-9 as the new king of Warzone's short-range meta. However, that assumption proved to be false, as the Renetti pistol with the JAK Ferocity Carbine Conversion Kit equipped currently leads all SMGs with a 490 millisecond time-to-kill speed. On average, it should only take around 8.5 bullets to down an enemy. In comparison, the HRM-9 has a time-to-kill speed of 612 milliseconds and can only down opponents in around 10.5 bullets.\n\n\nAdditionally, the Rennetti had a leg up on the HRM-9 because players will be able to use the pistol in underwater combat, but that's not possible with the SMG. Sidearms usually don't have better stats than primary weapons, so it shouldn't come as much of a surprise that Raven Software plans on making adjustments. \n\n\nIt also doesn't help that the community has picked up on just how strong the Renneti is, either. According to WZ Ranked, the pistol has a 19 percent pick rate, which ranks second in popularity rankings by a wide margin. Only time will tell, if the upcoming nerf is enough to put the beast down for good, but it's clear that a change was long-overdue.  \n\nThe post Warzone devs confirm nerf for overpowered Renetti appeared first on Destructoid.",

After checking the game out for a few hours and speaking to some of the lead developers at Moon Studios in Vienna, Austria, both myself and cover story writer Marcus Stewart are excited about No Rest for the Wicked – you can read more of our preview thoughts here, and you can read the cover story here. \nBut, excitement for No Rest for the Wicked aside, both Marcus and I are big fans of the team's Ori series, which began with Ori and the Blind Forest in 2015 and continued in the 2020 sequel, Ori and the Will of the Wisps.

We learn about his childhood fascination with becoming a manga artist, the transition from college life to working at Sega, and his early career developing games like Devi and Pii, Golden Axe 3, and Sonic the Hedgehog 3. Iizuka remembers the excitement and challenge during the transition from the Sega Genesis (known as the Sega Mega Drive in Japan) to the Sega Saturn, which allowed the team progress from 2D pixel art to 3D polygonal modeling.\nNotably, the Sonic the Hedgehog lead reflects on the early Dreamcast days, moving to the United States to better implement western culture into Sonic Adventure 2, and finally, describes his emotions after hearing Sega was exiting the hardware business and ending production of the Dreamcast. \nSonic the Hedgehog Lead Reflects on SEGA's Road to Dreamcast:\n\n\nPlease subscribe to Game Informer's YouTube channel if you enjoy this video.

However, it looks like a second season is already in the works. \nVariety reports (thanks, Eurogamer) that The California Film Commission has awarded $152 million in tax incentives to a dozen TV shows across various studios to lure production of those series into the state. $25 million of these tax credits has been allocated to Fallout's second season, so production is now expected to take place in California. Fallout’s $153 million budget is the largest of any show on this list\nSeason 1 was largely filmed in New York, with some production in Utah. However, as Variety notes, receiving this tax credit does not guarantee Amazon will accept it and relocate Fallout's production to California for Season 2.\n\n\nFallout premieres on Amazon Prime Video on Thursday, April 11. The eight-episode series is directed by Westworld showrunners Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, with Bethesda head Todd Howard serving as executive producer. The cast includes Ella Purnell, Walton Goggins, Kyle MacLachlan, and Aaron Moten. The show’s synopsis reads\n[Source: Variety]\nWill you be checking out Fallout this week?

The massive family tree of Samoan wrestlers dates back decades and includes members such as current undisputed champion Roman Reigns, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Yokozuna, Rikishi, and so many others. In a business filled with famous families, the Bloodline is likely the biggest family dynasty in pro wrestling history. \nThat got me thinking of similar family trees across all of video game fiction and if any of them could stand toe-to-toe against the Bloodline.

Plus, Tae says there will be no microtransactions in the game, save for one theoretical exception. \nThis news comes from a new interview with Korean publication Ruliweb, where Tae explained that while Stellar Blade will have a New Game+ mode at some point, it won't be available at launch, as translated by Genki_JPN on Twitter. Tae also told Ruliweb that players should not expect any microtransactions in Stellar Blade, but notes that one exception would be paid collaborations with another company's IP. \n\n\n\"We want to make it clear at this point that Stellar Blade will not require any additional expenses that gamers are not aware of beyond what they paid for the package,\" Tae told Ruliweb. \"The only exception is if we create collaboration costumes with another company's IP; those may be sold for a fee. Also, there is no New Game+ in the launch version, so please look forward to it being updated very soon.\" \nGiven that no collaborations have been announced at this point, Tae is likely just checking bases for hypothetical collaborations ShiftUp may or may not be pursuing. At any rate, given the popularity of ShiftUp's Goddess of Victory: NIKKE game on mobile devices, it's possible we see an internal collaboration between those two properties. \nStellar Blade is an action game launching on PlayStation 5 exclusively on April 26. It was announced in 2021 as Project EVE. There is a demo for Stellar Blade available on PSN that you can download right now if you're curious about how the game plays. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Stellar Blade feature for behind-the-scenes details and new insight from Tae. \n[Source: Ruliweb]\nAre you excited for Stellar Blade?

Now, Uniqlo has revealed The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is the next game to get the t-shirt treatment.\nThe clothes will launch in Japan this month – Uniqlo is based in Japan – before a release in the West happens at some point in the future, as reported by VideoGamesChronicle. As for when exactly to expect these shirts to hit the states, though, that remains unknown. \nThe Tears of the Kingdom line consists of six shirts, and you can check each out in the gallery below: \n\nOn the Japanese website for Uniqlo, each of these shirts is listed for 1,500 Yen, which converts to less than $10 a shirt. However, the price could be raised when these shirts come to Uniqlo stores in the states. \nFor more, read Game Informer's review of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and then read about how the game has crossed more than 20 million sales in less than a year.

It's also how we learned the game will run at 30 FPS on Xbox Series X/S. \nSpeaking to German publication GamePro, Hellblade II visual effects director Mark Slater-Tunstill confirmed the game will run at 30 FPS alongside dynamic scaling on Xbox Series X/S, as reported by Wccftech. Slater-Tunstill told GamePro the 30 FPS makes sense with the game's more cinematic nature. However, if you're after higher frames, a beefier PC can likely accomplish that. \n\n\nRegardless of frames, Hellblade II is sure to be stunning visually. Developed in Epic Games' Unreal Engine 5, Ninja Theory told Polygon this engine has allowed the game's more realistic nature to be achievable, thanks to its Nanite geometry system and because \"the turnaround between scanning the thing and putting it in the level is drastically cut, and you can spend that time finessing.\" Be sure to read Polygon's full Hellblade II preview for more details on what to expect visually from this game. \nHellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 21. \nFor more, watch the latest Hellblade II trailer here, and then read about Hellblade II's photo mode and what to expect from it at launch.

Speaking with the developer over e-mail, the team says, \"We have been able to double the frame rate to 60 fps, added anti-aliasing, and implemented higher resolution settings so that players can take advantage of the power of a high-end PC.\" The game's layout has also been adjusted for the PC version.\nStar Wars: Galaxy of Heroes originally launched for mobile devices back in 2015, and has amassed a following over the years. In that time, players have figured out ways to emulate the game on PC, but this will be an official release. Along with improved visuals, the game will also support mouse and keyboard as well as keybinds (unfortunately \"there is no controller support at this time\"). Longtime players will also be able to bring all their progress over by linking their mobile account to their EA account when playing on PC for the first time, and all future updates will release on both mobile and PC platforms simultaneously. The teams says, \"The PC and mobile version will always be in lockstep and release updates at the same time.\"\nBeta access for the PC version will be available for current mobile players in May before expanding to a larger audience. From the developer: \"For those interested, they can head to the Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes website, sign up for the EA App, link their account, and they are now ready to register.

He revealed this during a recent interview with IGN, where he also confirmed Saber took Star Wars: KOTOR Remake with it following its split from Embracer Group. \nLast month, Embracer Group, the company behind the closure of Saints Row studio Volition Games and layoffs at companies like Black Forest Games and Eidos-Montréal, sold Saber in a $500 million deal. It sold the studio, which is also developing the first-person adventure Jurassic Park: Survival, to a group of private investors under Beacon Interactive, which is controlled by Karch. At the time of the sale, the company didn't mention its Star Wars: KOTOR Remake, leaving excited fans concerned for the game, which itself has already gone through some rocky development. \n\n\nNow, thanks to Karch's interview with IGN, we know the game is still in development. \n\"It's clear and it's obvious that we're working on this,\" Karch told the publication. \"It's been in the press numerous times. What I will say is that the game is alive and well, and we're dedicated to making sure we exceed consumer expectations.\" \nThat's all Karch shared about the remake, however, and IGN writes that in an investor call following the announcement of Saber's sale, Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors implied the remake might still be a long ways away. \nFor more about the game, watch the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake reveal trailer, and then read about how Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic's biggest issue is how it plays.

Clans, however, is the first time in a long time the video games have leaned into the universe's fiction in a big way. The single-player (or cooperative) campaign features a full narrative complete with cutscenes and characters, which is quite different from the recent entries which have primarily been focused on competitive online action.\nJoin Charles Harte and me as we take a look at gameplay for Clans, which is coming this year to consoles and PC.\n\n\nHead over to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

It sounds annoying, but to my surprise, it's made me enjoy the game even more than I already did.\nIt's worth noting there are some fast travel options in the game, but they're limited. Oxcarts are the easiest, most affordable option, but they're only available in certain cities, and each route only has one of two destinations. They're also prone to attacks. In one extreme case, I got off the cart to slay some goblins, turned around to get back on the cart, and saw it get absolutely decimated by a griffin attack, leaving me stranded in the middle of nowhere. The other fast-travel option is an expensive item called a ferrystone, whi…",

          "description": "Last week, Embracer Group announced it was selling Gearbox Software to Grand Theft Auto publisher Take-Two for $460 million. Hours after the sale, some Gearbox employees announced on social media that they had been let go from the company. Today, Gearbox has confirmed these departures.\nIn a statement to Eurogamer, Gearbox states that an unknown number of employees have been let go but that those affected are not tied to the development of upcoming games. Gearbox stated last week that it has six titles in the works, including a new Borderlands game. \n\"As we strive towards our mission to entertain the world, we are grateful that our talent and capability are of interest to you and your audience,\" says Gearbox as part of its statement. \"The Embracer Group will continue to report on their restructuring program that impacted some parts of Gearbox today that are not tied to the development of Gearbox Software games.\"\nWhile Gearbox has not divulged the number of staff members let go, several employees took to social media soon after the announcement of the sale to announce their departures. Among them, Gearbox PR manager Jennifer Locke stated on X that she and “countless others” had been affected, as surfaced by Eurogamer.  \nEmbracer sold Gearbox (after acquiring it for 1.3 billion in 2021) as part of an ongoing effort to reduce costs after betting on a $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group that ultimately fell through last year. Embracer has spent the last few months either selling off its studios, shutting them down, or laying off employees as part of a massive restructuring process to recoup losses from this failed deal. \n[Source: Eurogamer]",

          "description": "Total Eclipse, a real-time, curse-breaking, 3D adventure (with a dash of Indiana Jones flair), is ready for public testing!\nOriginally unleashed by Incentive Software Ltd. in 1988, Total Eclipse added yet another groundbreaking title to their repertoire of revolutionary games.\nStep into the shoes of a heroic archeologist on October 26, 1930, as a total solar eclipse akin to the one happening today over North America looms over Cairo. Knowing of the Ardognus prophecy, created by the powerful high priest Hahmid III, you must find and destroy the hidden shrine devoted to Ra before the eclipse occurs.\nEmbark on this exciting journey packed with a trusty gun for blasting through doors or dispatching undead mummies; a compass to guide you through a treacherous pyramid; a wristwatch to track the precious time left; and a water bottle to fight dehydration (you’re only human after all). \nCan you solve this ancient mystery within 120 minutes and avert catastrophe, or will Rah's wrath obliterate the moon?\nOur modern reimplementation of the Freescape engine features graphics using hardware mode (OpenGL) at arbitrary resolution. The initial Total Eclipse support includes DOS (EGA/CGA modes), ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC. More releases are coming at a later date. Additionally, there are three playable demos if you want to test the game. Please contact us if you have some other release or demo.\nTo play any of these supported releases, you will need a daily development build. As always, please submit your bug reports to our issue tracker.\n>",

The titans of industry were inspired to produce more goods when I visited their factories. But as the years have passed, so do their eyes pass over me, to eye curiously my replacements. Will you try the new style, ma’am? It’s so much better than that old thing. I’ve watched my friends grow old and die. My brother got caught in traffic and caused a horrific level crossing collision. I get sick more often, wheezing to a halt wherever I am. When I visit the doctor for a spot of renewal, they tell me, “Sorry, I can’t help. You’re too old.” When will I be autoreplaced? Woe is the tale of the Balogh Goods Truck. But what if we could slow or pause the steady march of time? In OpenTTD 14, you can.",
