          "description": "The whole package is apparently \"great value for consumers\".\nRockstar lifted the lid on a Red Dead Redemption port for the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 earlier this week, and one of the major talking points since then has been the $50 USD price tag. Some fans feel it's simply too much for what appears to be a relatively simple port that's actually missing content, although Rockstar is referring to this particular release as a \"new conversion\".\nNow, speaking to IGN, Rockstar's parent company Take-Two Interactive has defended this price point. Company CEO Strauss Zelnick mentioned how this amount is believed to be the \"commercially accurate price\" for a release like this. He also mentioned how the add-on Undead Nightmare added \"great value\" to this particular package, although he didn't confirm whether or not it was the reason behind the price point.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

We recently saw Retro Bowl bring us back to the game's 8-bit roots, and Saber is looking to bring even more big-head Playgrounds-esque charm to the game with Wild Card Football later this year. This is football at its most simplistic, so where do you turn if you want to experience the complexities of the game?\nThe answer might be Legend Bowl, a new American football sim from publisher Top Hat Entertainment and developer Super Pixel Games that aims to show the tactical side of the sport both on and off the field. We were recently able to chat with the game's lead developer, Javier Martinez, to find out what went into making Legend Bowl stand out from the crowd.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

How was this done? Game Freak launched a new set of games – Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal – in the late '90s (or early 2000s, depending on the region) and this of course meant a slew of new monsters to catch and train all over again. This also yielded new sets of trading cards, a new series of anime, new merchandise, new manga, and everything in between. It's a formula that's continued to work ever since, and it was only logical that Nintendo also followed suit in the console department with a sequel on the Nintendo 64 – Pokémon Stadium 2.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

When Red and Blue first hit Western shores in 1998, those 151 legends would bring with them a wave of merchandise, cementing the series in history as the cultural epidemic it really was. Airplanes, cars, buildings; all were infected by the Pokévirus, but none were quite so potent as the powerhouse that was the Pokémon Trading Card Game. Wizards of the Coast first brought them to the US in 1999, and the rest is school playground history.

          "description": "Sega have formally unveiled the next steaming helping of Total Warhammer 3 DLC, Shadows of Change, which adds three Legendary Lords to this already-jam-packed strategy game: the Changeling for the demonic Tzeentch faction, Yuan Bo for Grand Cathay, and Mother Ostankya for Kislev, plus a brace of new campaign mechanics, units and battlefield abilities. \nI've been going off Total War lately - I fired up a new Lizardman game last month, having developed a hankering for dinos after reviewing Exoprimal, and found myself lingering in disappointment on each faction's reliance on rock-paper-scissors unit relationships. There's only so many times you can do that dance of shieldwalls before it loses its charm. Still, it sounds like the new Tzeentch Lord might wash away my Total Warennui, in being one of those playstyles that is more about tricking and invading rivals than taking territory.\nRead more",

          "description": "I am but a stripling level 4 sorcerer in Baldur's Gate 3, still learning to distinguish my Magic Missiles from my Chromatic Orbs, my Cantrips from my Colour Sprays (or at least, restore my memories of these concepts from my long-ago Baldur's Gate 2 playthrough). I've just discovered the finer applications of Mage Hands, which are a great antidote to goblin archers - simply spawn one behind the offender, use it to hurl them from the cliff they're standing on, and chuck a nearby crate after them for good measure. Magical indeed! Or so I thought, before I read about the real spells that lurk at the top of the level-up ladder in the D&D player handbook. \nThese feats of wizardry make Mage Handing seem about as otherworldly as setting an alarm clock. Take Wish, a ninth level conjuration that allows you to \"alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires\", up to and including generating pricey equipment from nothing and rewinding time. Or how about Prismatic Wall, which spawns an ephemeral barrier 90-feet long, made up of seven layers that inflict a different effect on any creature passing through, from poison to petrification? Spicy enough for you, goblin archers? Sadly, it doesn't sound like either of these spells is hidden away anywhere in Baldur's Gate 3, which caps progression at level 12. And it's far from certain that they'll be added in the shape of an expansion pack. There's a good reason for this: higher level D&D spells and abilities are so potent it's hard to include them without turning Baldur's Gate 3 characters into gods.\nRead more",

          "description": "Baldur's Gate 3, out of early access last week, is an officially licensed D&D RPG of many hours of turn-based combat, as you bring together a rag-tag group of misfit heroes to save the world from a mysterious cult. And also every single one of those misfit heroes wants to get at you. In many cases with zero prompting from you whatsoever. It doesn't end with your team companions either; by my loose estimations, any character who is in upwards of three cutscenes comes with a 70% chance of propositioning you. There's one romance option that I experienced effectively as a jump scare, entering a cutscene to see a character suddenly and casually-not-casually shirtless. It never ends. In hindsight, picking from a selection of genitals in character creation was probably a clue.\nRead more",

With legal proceedings on-going, Ironmace have released this tense first-person dungeon crawler via their own Blacksmith launcher and third-party store Chaf Games.

And yet, what’s most impressive about the Strix Scar 17 is not simply its immense power, but how balanced – sensible, even – the whole laptop feels like in use.

After all, Johnny 90s Developer didn't spend months knocking together a bespoke cover system or fancy artstyle so that you could badge it \"quaint\", \"old school\" and so on, 30 years later. Assuming you can still access the game at all.\n\"I don't like the word 'retro game',\" Kamiya told VGC in a wide-ranging interview also notable for some chunky insights on onomatopoeia in Japanese manga and its US adaptations. \"I'm obviously not a native English speaker so it might be something I'm interpreting from a Japanese perspective, but hearing the word 'retro' from a Japanese viewpoint, suggests more of a 'fad' brought back from a past era and reskinned for the current era.\"\nRead more",

But for the citizens of Videoverse, an online community that's part and parcel of the soon to be defunct 1-bit video games console the Kinmoku Shark, this sense of an ending is something that many of them aren't equipped to deal with, least of all teenager Emmett, who's just discovered the fan page for his favourite video game, Feudal Fantasy. \nAs he deals with the prospect of having to bid farewell to friends old and new, including the mysterious but talented fan artist Vivi, Videoverse taps into a potent and nostalgic melancholy. It's a love letter to the early internet at its rose-tinted best, and to the lost, formative spaces that brought so many like-minded individuals together and gave them a sense of purpose. Yes, there are trolls spoiling everyone's fun, and yes, there's a hint of something more nefarious going on underneath Videoverse's source code. But another Hypnospace Outlaw this is not. Rather, this is a proto-internet tale that's all about the friendships we form online, and the bonds that carry us forward when real-life relationships just don't cut it anymore.\nRead more",

Now, there are bunch of fantastic VR brain-ticklers swimming in the pond, such as the time-travelling epic Wanderer, the perspective-bending A Fisherman's Tale series, and the ingenious automation extravaganza The Last Clockwinder. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Some gorgeous rotoscoping gives its few characters a sense of constant motion that's unreal and very lifelike at once, and it's sometimes pushed further by having them decelerate to a blurred freeze frame when you stop walking. The backgrounds are static but interactable things shimmer a bit, like in old cartoons where you could always tell what was background and what was going to do something.

          "description": "I'm not afraid to admit this, but it's become increasingly obvious over the last few days of playing Baldur's Gate 3 that my ability to create interesting custom characters is severely lacking compared to other members of the RPS Treehouse. Case in point, our Ed breezily announced yesterday in our team Slack that he was playing as a Dark Urge bard called, wait for it, Edders Sheeran like it was no big deal whatsoever. I'm not gonna lie, a tiny part of me died inside upon hearing this, simply because of its sheer (not a pun), unadultered brilliance. I mean, come on, it's so good it should actually be illegal. \nBut it also confirmed to me a deep dark truth about myself that I think I knew deep down, but had kinda been pushing under my equally drab mental carpet for years and years. I'm quite boring at the end of the day, and am the type of person who, no matter the game, always creates basically the same identical person every single time. \nRead more",

I don't like squinting at brow density or sliding the juiciness of my lips down a scale, twisting and turning my character as if it really and truly matters when I drown them in chainmail anyway. But getting my fella right for Baldur's Gate 3 was of utmost importance, as they'd be my 100+ hour vessel for awful, awful decisions. And I've started off strong, having created an awful little guy.\nLet me introduce you to Edders Sheeran, the bard. On the surface he seems like a cheerful sprite, ready to pat his little drum and have everyone do a nice little dance. Truthfully, he is a psychopath who suppresses the urge to kill, thanks to a malevolent background choice that most would leave for a second playthrough, so as he plays Shape Of You, he also imagines the Shape Of You Dead.\nRead more",

This is not something the game discourages. In fact, I would say that Larian's Dungeons-&-Dragons-but-digital game actively encourages it. Both Edders and Graham found out that you can die almost immediately upon finishing the tutorial and encountering a dying bit of ocotopus sashimi in a crashed ship; fail a roll involved in talking to this unfortunate mind flayer and that's it. Kaput, in about an hour. As Graham observed, the lesson that this teaches you is not \"mind flayers are dangerous\", because you have already learned this lesson on account of the opening cutscene being all about that. The lesson is \"the DM is a prick, so savescum often\". \nRead more",

But once you get in-game, his toolkit has always been fairly underwhelming - with the exception of his Death Totem, which never seemed to sit well thematically with the character.\nSeason 18 of Apex looks to change all that.

But I implore you to take a moment to remember the great Losiir, a Githyanki soldier who most of you will probably never meet. That's because he only shows up if you pick Lae'zel as your origin character, because who else would be there to do her fancy sword lunge from above if not a gender-swapped version of basically herself? But he's a good egg, Losiir, even if his run-time as an official Baldur's Gate companion is, err, somewhat short-lived. \nRead more",

But before you jump into creating your favourite D&D build, do take a moment to watch the Introductions for each of its fixed origin characters, too. They're great fun, well-written and have some good jokes in them, but they also reveal some important details about your companions-to-be that you might not have gleaned otherwise.

          "description": "The distance from the roof of the Counting House to the nearest building in Baldur’s Gate is vast, by design. The waterfront bank where the city’s great, good and gangster store their gold stands with its back to the sea, while a long and well-guarded bridge extends from its maw, like a money-hungry tongue. Legend says its top two floors are entirely without windows, the House an eyeless god to the citizens who reside on the hillside that slopes down toward the docks. So how was Gale, the wizard prodigy, able to bound from a faraway balcony to the brim of the bank, as if stepping lazily out onto his porch with a mug of coffee? Some say strange sorcery was afoot, but I’ve seen his character sheet, and so can be more specific.\nUpon levelling up, Gale multiclassed as a sorcerer - an odd choice, but one that allowed him to unlock the ability to throw magic from a great range. Suddenly, while casting a teleport spell, this hybrid mage was able to reach across the wide moat of the Counting House and land safely on a high ledge. It’s one of many obscure class synergies via which, Larian imagines, you’ll be able to break their level design in unexpected and entertaining ways.\nRead more",

GLaDOS’ return, for instance, is a stretch of pure puzzling with just a dash of dread, while your first steps into the abandoned 1960s Aperture facility interrupt a fairly hopeless tone with an upbeat sense of discovery. For me, though, Portal 2 peaks late. So late that by the time it begins, your journey through the 'true' puzzle chambers are essentially over, leaving you as little more than a loose end in the big glowing eye of a former buddy. It’s Chapter 9: The Part Where He Kills You! Mmm, love that part.\nRead more",

It's certainly one of my personal favourites, and as this year's RPS 100 has proven, it's also greatly beloved by the rest of the RPS Treehouse. A brilliantly conceived murder mystery puzzle box (boat?) that not only has you working out whodunnit, but howdunnit, Obra Dinn is one of those detective games that really thrusts you into the thick of its deduction process. As you set about working out the identities and causes of death for each of the 60 souls onboard, it places you firmly in front of the ship's wheel before giving you free rein to steer its hull of supernatural horrors into whatever port of judgment you deem fit. \nThere are no truly wrong answers in Obra Dinn, but due to the nature of how you go about solving it, it's also one of those games I can't play too often without feeling like I know all the answers already. It's only now, five years later, that I feel like I could probably go back to Lucas Pope's nautical masterpiece and marvel at it afresh on a second playthrough, but there's one particular set of crew unmaskings that even its time-travelling stopwatch can't erase from my memory banks. Spoilers to follow obviously, but if you know, you know. I'm talking about the shoe and hammock revelation. \nRead more",

This headcrab and zombie-infested cess pit is an absolute horror show right from the off. Moans and screeches assault your ears from every nook and cranny of this dark murder hole, and if the hoarse crow calls and suspiciously high number of propane barrels weren't enough to put you off, the bloodied torsos lodged against its log cabin walls by deep set saw blades certainly will. Every fibre of your being is telling you to get the hell out of this place, and that surely, the Combine forces chasing you down here can't be worse than what's in front of you. \nBut I'd also add an addendum to that heading that goes something like this: \"We don't go to Ravenholm, and definitely not with just a gravity gun.\" This is a place that demands you to have as much firepower as you can possibly muster, such are the monstrosities that lie in wait here. But what did baby Katharine decide to do when she was playing it alone on her terrible university laptop in the dead of night back in 2010? She decided to have a go at that old Zombie Chopper achievement for no good reason whatsoever. And what followed was even more horrifying than Ravenholm had any right to be. \nRead more",

The grimdark horrors of Age Of Darkness: Final Stand might be a bit too hard as nails for my personal liking, but there's something about the act of building up my little settlements and defending them against ever-larger nightly hordes that just unlocks something in my brain that says, 'Yes, more of this, please'. It's the same feeling I got from the blocky delights of Diplomacy Is Not An Option and the deckbuilding, comic-book stylings of ORX, too, but now there's a new kid that's ridden into town who I think might be the king of the lot. \nThronefall is a more minimalist take on the citybuilder tower defender, but while its bright colours might look like the distant cousin of a Townscaper toybox (it is, after all, made by the same dev wot did the equally charming Islanders), this deadly little thing is absolutely genius. It's only just come out in early access today, but I've been having a great time with a pre-release build of it, and can feel it sinking its claws into me with every attempt at its final level. \nRead more",

The resulting crack gives me such a fright that I fling my arms out and smack my hand against the corner of a bookcase.\nThis has been my experience of playing the first few hours of Half-Life 2’s excellent fan-made VR mod, a completely free add-on that transforms Valve’s 2004 masterpiece into a full virtual reality experience. Under my direct control, Gordon Freeman is less a time-displaced MIT graduate with a penchant for murder and instead a gawking tourist who’s more interested in staring at canal architecture than liberating humanity.

So do Valve, judging by how dev commentary has appeared (in identical, node-activatable form) in most of their games since.

My poor mom had to track down a huge list of supplies the school said we needed, from pencils and paper to expensive binders and calculators. Sure, back to school sales took the sting out of these mandatory purchases, but it was often a real stretch to get everything I needed, and I'd need to make friends quickly to borrow anything I didn't manage to come to school with. \nThat's why I was particularly amused, a decade and a bit later, to find out that Ebay is offering 20% off back to school purchases in the US, and that category of products includes a $999 LG OLED gaming monitor. Even for a university student, that's one heck of an upgrade for the new school year - but a darn good deal if you're considering this kind of ultra-premium gaming monitor. \n\nGet the LG 27GR95QE 27-inch 240Hz 1440p OLED gaming monitor for $718 w/ code SAVE4SCHOOL (was $999)\n\nRead more",

But when I look back on this tabletop-infused RPG and think of my favourites, there is one that stands head and shoulders above the rest. It isn't one of Citizen Sleeper's more emotional story beats (I miss ya, Lem and Mina), nor is it its most thrilling (big love to my man Feng). Rather, it's one of the game's quietest and arguably least significant plot points, but the fact it's there at all is probably what cemented Citizen Sleeper as one of my favourite games of last year. It is, of course, befriending The Stray who takes up residence in your Lowend apartment.\nRead more",

          "description": "I can almost remember the moment in the original Dishonored when I realised, \"Crap. Chaos is coming, and there's nothing I can do to stop it.\" It was around the halfway point of the game that the world of Dunwall was visibly starting to sour before me, and it was all because I hadn't quite taken the time to truly understand how its chaos system worked. I'd let too many of my mistakes get away from me, killed one too many people in the process, and now its Low Chaos ending seemed permanently out of reach. I thought in vain that if I behaved really nicely for the rest of the game, it might balance out my former transgressions. But alas, it was not to be. I ended the game in High Chaos, and I was furious. For whatever reason, getting a game's 'good' ending really mattered to me back then.\nIt was this personal failing that drove me to some extreme lengths when Dishonored 2 came out a couple of years later. Not only did I resolve to do a Clean Hands run this time, guaranteeing a Low Chaos ending by refusing to kill anyone, but as I cast my eye down its list of Steam achievements, I also got it into my head that, 'You know what? If we're going no-kill, let's Shadow run it as well and do it completely unseen at the same time.' A great idea at the time, I thought, if a little unusual for me. Cut to my fifth hour trying to clean out Kirin Jindosh's Clockwork Mansion on a review deadline, however, and you might think that decision would have worn a little thin. But you'd also be totally and utterly wrong. \nRead more",

Arkane swung at the live service hero shooter and missed, with some comments writing off my sadness in the review as an inevitability. Sure, there's definitely truth to Arkane having changed over the years, of course it has. But I don't think there's anything wrong with being hopeful.\nI think of Dishonored 2's A Crack In The Slab mission as both a beacon of Arkane's past pedigree and a symbol of their situation in the present.

          "description": "The Expanse is one of those TV shows that I've started to watch about three times now. Matthew (RPS in peace) and I keep hearing great things about it, but every attempt we make has always ended the same way. We get a couple of episodes in, determined to make it a little bit further than we did before, but there's just something about it that can't quite hold our interest long enough to properly stick with it. One day, though, I do hope to finish the first season of The Expanse, and my ideal scenario is for the episodic prequel game from Telltale and current Life Is Stange custodians Deck Nine to be just the kick up the bum I need to get through it.\nThe Expanse: A Telltale Series started the fortnightly release of its five episodes on the Epic Games Store last week, and I played through the first, Archer's Paradox, over the weekend. As you'd perhaps expect from a first episode, the plot scales lean heavily toward setup here as opposed to actionable 'so and so will remember that' choices. Still, its centrepiece of exploring a big exploded battleship to find some sort of money-printing macguffin is also like such a sedate, threat-free version of Dead Space that it can't help but feel a little lightweight at the same time - and that's not just because you're floating around in zero gravity for half of it. It does a reasonable job of laying down what I hope is some good groundwork for the origin story for TV favourite Camina Drummer, and her fellow crewmates are a fun, bubbling pressure cooker of personalities just waiting to spill over into conflict, but I do also worry that the game will have the same truncated fate as my attempts to watch the show. \nRead more",

The second Godrick The Grafted is reduced to a sickly pile of wobbly limbs, I turn the game off and walk away.\nIt’s not that I don’t like Elden Ring. I’m not struggling to connect with its open world take on the Souls genre. I’m not put off by the difficult encounters that await me, or the obtuse challenges I’ll be forced to overcome. The answer is weirdly simple. Limgrave provides me with everything I could ever want from a Souls game to the point that when Godrick croaks his final rancid breath and his (presumably) four tongues comically lop out of his stupid mouth, I’m left with the deep satisfaction that comes with the end of a journey, rather than the beginning of one.\nRead more",

There is microcode mitigation available but it will be costly for AVX2/AVX-512 workloads with GATHER instructions in hot code-paths and thus widespread software exposure particularly for HPC and other compute-intensive workloads that have relied on AVX2/AVX-512 for better performance.",

          "description": "In case you haven’t heard, Baldur’s Gate 3 is pretty hot right now. Our own Eric “Blast Man” Van Allen is loving what he’s played of it so far, noting that it showcases “a clear love for the role-playing craft at its heart.” Now, that’s all well and good for those who live and breathe D&D. But what about those of us who know basically nothing about Dungeons & Dragons outside of the existence of dungeons and–I’m going out on a limb for this one– possibly some dragons? Well, we've got a Baldur's Gate 3 guide for you.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Wx7eFMGkY\nOur video team is here to help. In “Ultimate Beginner's Guide for Baldur's Gate III,” even total newbies will learn how to navigate the game’s early hours. This includes tips like how to build your character, and how to warm up shopkeepers with your spare garbage. As a total D&D newbie, even I felt like I could succeed in Baldur’s Gate 3 after watching this. Whether you’re here for the information or some silly jokes, you should find something to like here.\nOf course, this comes hot on the heels of our ongoing Baldur’s Gate 3 coverage. Eric “Sticky Hands” Van Allen shared his own 10 tips for Baldur’s Gate 3, which contains unique tidbits you’ll want to read. He also shared some thoughts about how much Act 1 has changed since the game’s early access build (spoilers: it’s a fair amount). Expect to hear more from us about Baldur’s Gate 3, especially as we make our way through this massive title.\nThe post Kick back and watch our beginner’s guide video for Baldur’s Gate 3 appeared first on Destructoid.",

For the English release, it has been titled Fantastic Parodius! Pursuing the Former Glory.\nIf you’re unfamiliar with the Parodius series, it’s something of a spin-off or parody of Gradius.

The reward is a coaster set priced at a whopping 700 Platinum Points, and it comes with four coasters and two sticker sheets.\nHere's the full description of the set from Nintendo:\n\"This set of four coasters features artwork of characters Noah, Mio, Eunie, Taion, Lanz, Sena, Riku and Manana from the game. The coaster set also comes with two sheets of character stickers. These coasters work well when relaxing with a cup of coffee, tea, or cocoa, just like when you're at a Rest Stop in the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 game. Each coaster features a cork underside and a laminated top. The set comes in an adventure-ready metal container.\"\n\nTo be fair to its higher point-based price, it also has those stickers, and a metal container. It's important to note (as the description says) that the coasters themselves aren't metal: they're cork/laminated on top. Still, that's far better than some of the past My Nintendo paper coaster offerings that practically melt after a few uses.\nNeed Platinum Points?\nAs a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time. Just know that items go out of stock on My Nintendo frequently, and some are never restocked\nThe post Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Camping Coasters are the next My Nintendo reward appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Broforce Forever update to Devolver Digital and Free Lives 2015 muscle-hit Broforce has arrived.\nGrab your best (or most reliable) bro for some bro-op today. According to the news post about it, Broforce Forever is the result of years of disappointing attempts at creating further bro content. According to the devs “We had various elaborate ideas for the update - including things such as procedurally generated levels, or a standalone roguelite spinoff version of the game. Unfortunately, for various reasons - mostly that the ideas were bad and the execution worse - they did not work out.”\nhttps://youtu.be/8c2aYrFV9uE\nWhat we wound up with is an expanded campaign, new challenge levels, new enemies, and six new bros. This includes characters based on John Spartan from Demolition Man, El Mariachi from Desperado, and lady-bro Buffy from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Oomph! Can you even talk about Broforce without flexing? I can’t. Hurgh!\nMy husband and I did some bro-op through Broforce back when we were still dating. It was an early demonstration of the gulf in skill between us when it came to platformers. Anytime a level required us to jump across some tricky ledges, I had to take the lead. It was a good time, but my husband is still a scrub.\nThe Broforce Forever update is available now for free on PC, Switch, Xbox One, and PS4.

This is described as a “completely new production” but is based on the 1990 NES game, Shadow of the Ninja, also known as Blue Shadow in Europe and Yami no Shigotonin Kage in Japan. It’s set for release in Spring 2024.\nTengo Project is the studio behind Wild Guns Reloaded and last year’s Pocky & Rocky Reshrined. Both are based on rather obscure retro games in their own right, but both are absolutely stellar.\nhttps://youtu.be/5u6KyZsKNLo\nI must admit that I haven’t yet played Shadow of the Ninja, but it’s on the Switch Online NES channel, so why the hell not? However, it has been on my radar for years now. It’s well remembered for being a rad ninja platformer, but more importantly, because it had a two-player coop. That multiplayer will be retained for Shadow of the Ninja - Reborn, as it brings back Hayate and Kaeda.\nPerhaps, more importantly, is that they’re also bringing in Iku Mizutani to compose the soundtrack. Not only was Mizutani the original composer on the 1990 version, but he also created the soundtrack to 1991’s Shatterhand and the PC-88 version of Snatcher.\nShadow of the Ninja - Reborn is coming to Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC sometime in Spring 2024.\nThe post Shadow of the Ninja – Reborn is the next retro revival from Tengo Project appeared first on Destructoid.",

If you aren't content playing as the Survivor Nic Cage, you'll now be able to play as Ellen Ripley. Those looking for a new Killer will get the classic Xenomorph alien from the movies. Furthermore, players will be able to escape the Xenomorph in a new Nostromo Wreckage map themed after the crashed ship.\n“Alien has been and continues to be one of the best sci-fi stories ever told – and to be able to collaborate with 20th Century Games on bringing this story into Dead by Daylight is a privilege for all of us at Behaviour Interactive,” says Mathieu Côté, Head of Partnerships for Behaviour Interactive.\nThe Xenomorph takes Stealth Killer to the next level, striking Survivors from the shadows with its razor-sharp tail. The Alien Killer also has a power called Runner Mode allowing it to walk more stealthily on four legs, reducing its Terror Radius.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3XKx4KKCXU\nSome other cool new additions as well\nA new interactive Map function called Control Stations is scattered throughout the Nostromo Wreckage map. Seven in total will spawn, allowing Survivors to interact with them to get a new Tool: the Remote Flame Turret. Also, the Xenomorph will be able to enter and exit tunnels underneath the Control Station, making it versatile for everyone.\nThe new Remote Flame Turret tool has a defensive attack that staggers the Xenomorph and ends its unique power. Furthermore, the tool adds a complex gameplay element as Survivors will have to strategically place the turret and use it at an ideal time. Also, if the turret overheats, players need to repair and protect it as the Xenomorph can destroy it.\nThe Dead by Daylight: Alien crossover is releasing on all platforms on August 29.\nThe post Escape the Xenomorph in Dead by Daylight: Alien crossover appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you thought annual Call of Duty releases were a thing of the past, think again. It's barely been a year since the reboot of Modern Warfare II came out, and now Modern Warfare III is nearly upon us already.\nIn a recent teaser uploaded to the official Call of Duty YouTube channel, it's been announced that MWIII will launch on November 10. At the time of writing, there's been no indication on what platforms the latest in the ongoing FPS series will be on. Rest assured, it will almost certainly be on the major current-gen systems, and possibly some previous-gen as well.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITIcmA4Zwa8\nAs for the teaser itself, it's just over 40-seconds long and doesn't really give a lot away. It seems this will be a direct sequel to 2022's Modern Warfare II, which in itself is a reboot of 2009's Modern Warfare 2.\nHidden messages\nEagle-eyed viewers may have noticed some numbers at the start of the clip. According to Polygon, this is actually a phone number. When a text message is sent to it, it reveals the following:\n*** COMMS SECURED ***\nmajor conflict incoming. a lot of opportunity.\nwe need someone like you, with experience in al mazrah\nare you able to receive sensitive intel\nyes / no\n[upon responding yes]\ngood\nexpect mission critical intel. a taste of what’s to come\n\nSeems very on-brand with the Call of Duty vibe.\nAs mentioned above, Modern Warfare II was released less than a year ago. It received fairly decent reviews and scores overall. Modern Warfare III continues the trend of Infinity Ward and Sledgehammer Games putting a new stamp on older entries. Will it be a rousing success? I mean, it's Call of Duty. It's going to sell in droves no matter what.\nThe post Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III confirms November release appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Responsible for leaving a lasting impression on the gaming world, Tomb Raider is still going strong, even if it's not as paradigm-shifting as it once was. That said, there's still love for Lara Croft and her adventures, and one creator has been tweaking the original 1996 release.\nYouTube user Dominus Aurate (as spotted by WCCF Tech) recently uploaded video footage from the OG Tomb Raider. Except in this instance, the legendary game has been given a bit of a lighting facelift, specifically when it comes to path tracing, thanks to Nvidia's RTX Remix tech.\nhttps://youtu.be/Ms8K13lCfl0\nAlthough it still pretty much looks the same in terms of its textures and polygonal aging, there have been some noteworthy changes to the lighting and shadow effects. It looks very impressive, breathing new life into the 27-year-old release.\nThose tombs won't raid themselves\nIt's nice to see the 1996 entry still getting some attention after all these years. Tomb Raider made waves for its 3D adventure story and gameplay mechanics (at a time when 3D was starting to take off).\nIt also introduced the world to Lara Croft, who quickly became one of the gaming world's most recognizable characters. She's still gracing modern systems and the series has sold millions of copies worldwide.\nCroft (or her manor, at least) has also appeared in games like PowerWash Simulator, and Phoebe Waller-Bridge (best known for creating the critically acclaimed sitcom Fleabag) is writing Tomb Raider for a TV series.\nIn short, Croft is by no means done for. The older installments may look dated now, but it's nice to see modern technology giving a fresh look to a retro game.\nThe post Here’s the original Tomb Raider running with Nvidia’s RTX Remix appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "People can't get enough of Yoshi. He's happy, he's an incredibly useful power-up from time to time, and he's cute. What more could you want out of a companion? Well, more official artwork would be a start! New art of the adorable dino popped up on the Nintendo UK Twitter account this week, showing off a straw-hat-donning Mario with a yellow Yoshi pal. Nintendo is calling it an \"Original Mario wallpaper\" work, celebrating this very-hot summer of 2023.\nWe're big Yoshi fans in my household. Not only do we constantly relive games where Yoshi is playable, but we also can't help but smile every time he turns up. I also spent an inordinate amount of time in Yo'ster Isle in Super Mario RPG and will do so yet again when the remake arrives later this year. I'm really feeling the vibe of this artwork, though my summer experience doesn't look anything like this!\nWhere to download the Mario and Yoshi Summer 2023 wallpaper\nYou can find the original source here on Nintendo of Japan's site, which includes the following resolution options:\n1080 x 1920\n1200 x 1920\n1242 x 2688\n1536 x 2048\n1920 x 1080\nNote that you will need a Nintendo account to download the wallpaper directly, though there isn't a Platinum Point/My Nintendo requirement/cost associated with it.\nThe post Nintendo just shared super cute Mario and Yoshi wallpaper art appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "During today's Pokemon Presents presentation, we saw Mewtwo announced as an upcoming Tera Raid encounter in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet. However, another legendary Pokemon has made its appearance, and this one's much easier to get. Specifically, virtually anyone who owns either Pokemon Scarlet or Pokemon Violet can claim Mew as a mystery gift right now.\nUntil Monday, September 18, trainers can use the code GETY0URMEW in the Mystery Gift menu to instantly grab Mew. That's a zero and not an O in \"Y0UR,\" since you can't input O, I, or Z in codes. For those who need a refresher, you can get to Mystery Gifts by selecting the Poke Portal option in the in-game main menu. Select \"Mystery Gift\" at the bottom of the menu that pops up, and then select \"Get with Code/Password.\" If you input the code right, you should grab Mew right away.\n[caption id=\"attachment_395454\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot by Destructoid[/caption]\nThat said, not all Mews are created equal. Mew's moves and Tera Type will differ between each player, so you may see some funky results. For example, my Mew has a Ground Tera Type and knows Earth Power, Swift, Light Screen, and Life Dew. A little random for my endgame focused file, but Earth Power would wreck house in the early game. Anyone who can access the Mystery Gift option during this period can claim Mew, including new players.\nIt always feels a little surreal to me whenever I see Mew given away like this. I mean, I know these legendary Pokemon distributions happen all the time these days. But after the schoolyard hysteria over getting Mew back in the Red & Blue era, I always expect to just get this monster with a glitch or a GameShark. I don't know how great Mew will fare against Mewtwo specifically, but my Life Dew Mew will help me on my quest to always use healers in Tera Raids.\nThe post Mew is now available as a Mystery Gift in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Pokemon Scarlet & Violet have had an interesting run of Tera Raid events. Until now, most of the 7-Star encounters have revolved around starters from previous games, usually with a strategically picked Tera Type that makes them tricky to take down. But now, with the impending release of DLC for Pokemon Scarlet & Violet, Mewtwo is here to kick the Tera Raid intensity up a notch.\nFrom September 1 to September 17, Mewtwo will appear as a Tera Raid in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet. It will sport the Psychic Tera Type, so needless to say, this thing's Psychic attacks will hit hard. Normally, I would say this means Dark-type Pokemon will prevail. But if there's one thing I know about Tera Raid Pokemon, it's that they love to punish their obvious weaknesses. Aura Sphere will almost certainly appear in Mewtwo's move pool.\nTo help trainers prepare, Scarlet & Violet will see promotional raids throughout August that drop some key items to strengthen your team. The first encounter will appear from August 9 to August 17, with the second encounter running from August 19 to August 31. We didn't receive specifics about these raids, but I'd expect something similar to a 5-Star Blissey raid. In other words, an easy loot piñata for trainers to take down in a minute before claiming rewards.\nIf you read my older Tera Raid guides, you could probably tell how exhausted I felt after a while. The release schedule just got so fast, and I can only use Annihilape so much before it gets stale. However, with legendary Pokemon entering the fray, I might dip into the scene again. This monster harassed me enough in Pokemon Stadium, so I've got a score to settle.\nThe post Challenge Mewtwo as a Pokemon Scarlet & Violet Tera Raid in September appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "During the August 8 Pokemon Presents, The Pokemon Company announced two classic Pokemon titles are coming to Nintendo Switch Online. First up is the Pokemon Trading Card Game which came out on Gameboy Color in 1998. The second is Pokemon Stadium 2 which hit N64 in 2000.\nBoth titles are coming to the Nintendo Switch Online service today, August 8. While it appears Pokemon TCG will be available on the base NSO service, Pokemon Stadium 2 requires the Expansion Pack.\nWhile Pokemon TCG certainly isn't one of the traditional Pokemon games like Red, Blue, Yellow, etc., it's still fantastic. In fact, I remember playing it after those titles and thinking it was such a unique take on Pokemon. Instead of choosing a Pokemon at the start, players choose from one of three different TCG decks and begin their adventure to become the world's greatest TCG player. Similar to traditional games, you head out to defeat the eight Club Masters and earn their Medals, comparable to Badges.\nPokemon Stadium 2 is a sequel to the original which is actually the first time we saw Generation II Pokemon in full 3D. Back in 2000, the popular sequel was also the only Pokemon title to use the N64 Expansion Pak. In Pokemon Stadium 2, players focused more on Pokemon battles rather than catching them all.\nOverall these are two great Pokemon titles being added to the service. Hopefully, this will also pave the way for the more traditional Pokemon GBC titles to come later.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QiLe4pTHAE\nThe post Pokemon TCG and Pokemon Stadium 2 coming to Nintendo Switch Online appeared first on Destructoid.",

Though it was originally slated for an August 8 release, the game has since been delayed to August 22 on all platforms.\nhttps://twitter.com/skyboundgames/status/1688712585175261184\nIt is a brief delay triggered by a slight bug developers found. As a Tweet by Skybound Games explains, it was “discovered that it was possible for players to lose their save game progress when playing WrestleQuest on multiple different devices.”\n[caption id=\"attachment_360115\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"] Image via Mega Cat Studios.[/caption]\nWrestleQuest gets pushed back a few weeks\nThe delay may be disappointing, though the stated reason for it is understandable. WrestleQuest has hours of content, taking players on a journey to become the greatest pro wrestler. The tweet also suggests that WrestleQuest will have cross-save capabilities.\nEarly impressions of the game have been mostly positive, with critics praising the art style and its engagement with the wrestling world. A few real-world wrestling superstars also make an appearance, including Andre the Giant, Jake “The Snake” Roberts, and Jeff Jarrett.\nThe delay may have been necessary, but it does push WrestleQuest into quite a busy time in gaming. It launches in the same week as Immortals of Aveumn and Armored Core 6.

This is great news, as we're talking about one of the very few highly successful games of the post '2010s that hasn't seen a single re-release. Few feelings beat knowing that the wait is over—even when we didn't know we were waiting for something in the first place.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5Nwgd_T1-4\nThough Rockstar isn't calling it a remaster, this RDR release developed by Double Eleven Studios looks a bit sharper than it did on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. An actual HD remaster was reportedly on the table for some time, but plans seem to have dissipated. From the way Rockstar is promoting it, it seems like the company is just going for an uncompromisingly straightforward re-release.\nThis is definitely not the RDR remake in Unreal Engine or in the Red Dead Redemption 2 engine that some have been speculating about for a while. The Red Dead Redemption re-release will also contain the famous Undead Nightmare DLC. This neat add-on clearly banked on the '2010s zombie craze by taking John Marston in a possibly non-canonical side quest against hordes of undead cowboys, but it's still pretty fun to play nowadays.\nRed Dead Redemption for the PS4 and Nintendo Switch will cost $49.99.

          "description": "I remember where I was when Blue Dragon was announced. Although I already had an Xbox 360 and was ready for it, some folks I knew bought one just for it given who was involved (Nobuo Uematsu, Hironobu Sakaguchi, Akira Toriyama): as Mistwalker and Microsoft Game Studios made a mad dash to put out more games from Japanese studios on the Xbox ecosystem.\nSo how did it actually go? Well, it depends on who you ask. For some, it was a dazzling RPG that stayed with them long after the credits rolled (no doubt in part due to famed artist Akira Toriyama's character designs), and helped pave the way for better games just like it. For others, it was a run-of-the-mill project that relied heavily on its presentation, without bringing a whole lot to the table compared to similar games before it. It's also roughly 50 hours long (originally across three discs), so if you aren't into it early on, odds are you'll fall off way before the end.\nYou can find out for yourself how it all went down with our new Lost in Time series, which will be airing every other week on the Destructoid YouTube channel. It's also still on sale digitally for $19.99 on the Xbox storefront and is playable on Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S.\nIf you're interested in hearing more about this often-forgotten RPG, check out the video on it below. The video team is currently looking for feedback on this series and what you might want to see in the future: so let them know in the YouTube comments!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlE0Sbt-jqU\nThe post Did you play Blue Dragon?

          "description": "Windows will almost certainly be the default operating system for more PC users and gamers. However, Linux seems to be slowly climbing the ranks, and it's now the second most popular OS on Steam, which could be owing to Valve's handheld device, the Steam Deck.\nAccording to a report from Phoronix (as spotted by Ars Technica), Linux saw its share of the market increase by half a percent for June, giving it a 1.96% share of the operating system pie.\n[caption id=\"attachment_395246\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"640\"] Screenshot via Destructoid.[/caption]\nThis means, as of now, it's beaten macOS, which currently has a market share of 1.84%. Of course, both pale in comparison to Windows, with the anonymous Steam survey showing that the Microsoft OS dominates with a whopping 96.21% share.\nAre more people turning to Linux then?\nThe one thing that needs to be taken into account is that much of this increase in Linux usage may well be down to the Steam Deck itself. The portable PC comes preinstalled with the SteamOS software, which is built on a custom version of Linux.\nErgo, anyone who buys a Deck to play games through their Steam account will be shown as being a Linux user. The version \"SteamOS Holo\" 64-bit was the most popular Linux version reported, which adds to the Steam Deck's case. It's also worth noting that not everyone will have taken the survey, but any discrepancies may not be significant anyway.\nIf anything, it kind of shows the popularity of the Steam Deck, that it's managed to influence the operating system market in this way. While companies like ASUS are offering their own alternatives, the Valve machine is still a force to be reckoned with in terms of mobile PC gaming.\nThe post Linux passes Mac for Steam’s second-most used OS, possibly due to Steam Deck appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you ever want an understanding of how Skyrim has managed to stay alive these past 12 years, just look to the modding community. There are tons of ways to tweak The Elder Scrolls 5, and a new one has recently come out that takes cues from one of Rockstar's most critically acclaimed releases.\nOver on Nexus Mods, veteran modder JaySerpa has been at it once again. This time, they've brought the sport of hunting to the chilly world of Skyrim. Called \"Simple Hunting Overhaul,\" it gives the Dragonborn the ability to take time out from all that hero questing and dragon slaying.\nhttps://youtu.be/m1aK9Njuxbo\nYou can skin the corpses of animals that have been killed, which you can then sell to vendors in a nearby town or city. Typical with JaySerpa's projects, this mod also incorporates NPC reactions to your hunting, making for a more immersive experience.\nThe creator says this Skyrim hunting mod of theirs was inspired by Red Dead Redemption 2. No prizes for guessing which particular aspect of the game.\nWho even plays vanilla Skyrim these days?\nIf you play the game on PC, you'll already be very familiar with the near-countless ways you can mess with Bethesda's epic 2011 RPG. Because, let's face it: after well over a decade, the cracks in Skyrim are more than showing.\nThe vanilla experience is still fun, but there's no sense in pretending that it's not aged quite significantly. This is where modding comes to the rescue, and people like JaySerpa are responsible for keeping TES5 very much in the limelight. That, and Bethesda wouldn't stop re-releasing the damn thing.\nWe can't say for certain whether The Elder Scrolls 6 will ever be able to live up to such a legacy. In fact, we can't even say for certain at what stage of development it's currently at. But Bethesda's next big RPG, Starfield, is due out in less than a month.\nThe post Skyrim hunting mod takes inspiration from Red Dead Redemption 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

It represents a new direction for the series, and the game earned itself considerable critical acclaim upon release, scoring a 9 here on Destructoid.

          "description": "Those who have been paying attention to the gaming world these past few days won't be surprised to learn that Baldur's Gate 3 is currently doing quite well for itself. In fact, when last checked, the game had hit a pretty big milestone, showing more than 800,000 concurrent players on Steam.\nTo get a bit more specific, according to SteamDB (a website that tracks and monitors all things related to the Steam client), the new Baldur's Gate experienced a peak of 814,666 players within the last 24 hours.\nhttps://youtu.be/XuCfkgaaa08\nBearing in mind, the game only came out last Thursday, so who knows whether this number could yet be beaten.\nTake THAT, 97 other games\nGoing one step further, Baldur's Gate 3 is currently the third most-played game on Steam, just behind Dota 2 and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Given that these other titles were either developed or published by Valve, you can safely say that BG3 is the most non-Valve-played game at the moment.\nLarian Studios' release had an impressive launch when it came out on August 3, scoring pretty big on PC. At the time of writing, it's sitting pretty with a Metacritic score of 95 and a user score of 9.2.\nIt's been nearly 23 years since the last major installment in the Baldur's Gate series (though we've had expansions and enhanced editions), so fans of the previous games have no doubt been massively anticipating this third entry.\nIt's hard to say whether this hype will continue, or whether we're seeing its peak already. After all, Sons of the Forest was a major overnight success, selling two million copies in just one day. Now, you don't really hear much from the co-op horror title. Then again, the Baldur's Gate name is likely to carry more weight in the AAA scene.\nThe post Baldur’s Gate 3 surpasses 800,000 concurrent players on Steam appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you were looking forward to playing the pro-wrestling-themed RPG WrestleQuest today for its launch, it looks like that card was subject to change. The game has suffered a last-minute delay and will now arrive on August 22.\nDeveloper Mega Cat Studios and publisher Skybound Games announced the delay yesterday evening, explaining the cause was due to the discovery of a save glitch. The statement reads,\n“When performing final checks on one of our launch platforms, we discovered it was possible for players to lose their save game progress when playing WrestleQuest on multiple different devices. Because this is a game filled with hours of content and player progress is so important, we could never bodyslam our fans like that.”\nWhile it’s a bummer to see the game get pushed back mere hours before launch, it’s a good thing the team caught this issue before it could affect players. Curious wrestling and RPG fans will have to wait another couple of weeks, but at least they'll presumably be able to play with some peace of mind. \nWrestleQuest unfolds in a world molded after action figure wrestling leagues with protagonist Randy “Muchacho Man” Santos on a quest to become the ultimate superstar. Inspired by classics like Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VI, you’ll partner with a large cast of fellow grapplers to unleash special attacks and tag team moves on your opponents. In addition to fictional personalities, several real-life stars appear in the game, including Jeff Jarrett, Jake “The Snake” Roberts, Sgt. Slaughter, among others.\nWresleQuest will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, PC, and on mobile via Netflix.",

Best of all, you can add one of the most coveted Pokémon from Gen I, Mew, to your party for free right now. Then, you can gear up to challenge the powerful Mewtwo during the aptly named Get Mew And Mewtwo event.\nBeginning now, you can receive Mew as a Mystery Gift in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. To do this, simply go to the Mystery Gift in-game menu while connected to the internet and enter the password \"GETYOURMEW\" before September 18. Each Mew's Tera Type, nature, and moves will be different to reflect the Mythical Pokémon's flexible capabilities. You'll be able to add Mew to your party and continue your adventures around the Paldea region, but you can also participate in the second portion of this event.\nThe second phase of this event kicks off September 1, with Mewtwo appearing in special Tera Raid battles. If you're able to defeat Mewtwo in these Tera Raid battles, you'll be rewarded with the opportunity to catch a Mewtwo with the Mightiest Mark, meaning these will be seven-star Tera Raid battles. The Pokémon Company also teases that if you challenge Mewtwo with Mew, you can expect \"something special.\"\nPokémon Scarlet and Violet will also play host to several other Tera Raid battle events during this time. Wave 1 runs from today until August 17, Wave 2 runs from August 18 until August 31, and then Mewtwo finally arrives from September 1 to September 17.\n\n\nDuring the same Pokémon Presents livestream, we also learned a lot about the upcoming Pokémon Scarlet and Violet expansions.

          "description": "Almost exactly one year ago, SNK announced a new Fatal Fury game, the first in over 20 years, was in the works. During EVO this weekend, the company revealed the game’s title is Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, alongside a new teaser trailer.\nThe video shows off some brief in-game footage of staples Terry Bogard and Rock Howard in action. Unfortunately, we don’t see much more than that, and SNK has only promised to share more information at a later date. \n\n\nThe last Fatal Fury game was 1999’s Garou: Mark of the Wolves, so a new entry has been a long time coming for fans. Hopefully, it arrives sooner than later and is another big fighting game to anticipate during a relative boom period for the genre thanks to Street Fighter 6 and the upcoming Mortal Kombat 1 and Tekken 8. Are you excited to play a new Fatal Fury game? Let us know in the comments!",

          "description": "Indie publisher Devolver Digital has announced a slew of delays for some of its more anticipated titles on the horizon. Framed through a humorous parody of a Nintendo Direct, Devolver released a \"Devolver Delayed Showcase\" to tell players all about the games they won't be playing in 2023. The showcase highlights five games in particular: The Plucky Squire, Skate Story, Anger Foot, Stick it to the Stickman, and Pepper Grinder.\n\"We have some exciting news about next year,\" one host says. \"This year's delays,\" the other host follows up. \"Some of our brightest upcoming titles are finding their way to 2024!\"\nThe Plucky Squire, a game that bounces between 2D and 3D gameplay, is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. Pixel-art platformer Pepper Grinder is currently slated to arrive on Switch and PC. Meanwhile, roguelite brawler Stick it to the Stickman, kickflipping sports-action game Skate Story, and foot-based first-person shooter Anger Foot are currently only listed for PC. \nYou can see the full Devolver Delayed Showcase below.\n\n\nDevolver Digital has had a solid 2023, with titles like Terra Nil receiving positive reviews, fan-favorite Bleak Sword DX making its way to Switch and PC, and new content for Cult of the Lamb, but today's delays are sure to disappoint some. However, by this point in time, many players recognize that it's better to delay a game than to launch it before it's ready, and with Gunbrella and The Talos Principle 2 still slated for 2023, the indie publisher still has seemingly a lot in store for fans before the calendar changes over to 2024.",

After 13 years, that finally changes with a surprise jump to PlayStation 4 and Switch.\nRockstar announced today that Double Eleven Studios is creating these ports, which include the zombie-themed Undead Nightmare expansion in one package. This also means that PlayStation 5 players can experience the game due to PS4 backwards compatibility. While it's unclear if these versions feature any kind of performance or graphical improvements, they do have additional language support for simplified and traditional Chinese, Korean, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, and Latin American Spanish. \n\n\nRed Dead Redemption follows former outlaw John Marston on a quest to track down the remaining members of his old crew, the Van der Linde Gang, in order to save his family. Its prequel, Red Dead Redemption II, arrived in 2018. If you missed out on the original the first time around, you can pick up Red Dead Redemption digitally on PS4 and Switch on August 17 for $49.99. Physical copies hit stores on October 13. To learn more about the game, be sure to read our original reviews for the base game and Undead Nightmare.",

          "description": "Following her announcement as the first all-new character to join the Street Fighter 6 roster by way of DLC, A.K.I. gave fans a taste of what to expect when she is added to the game this fall. During this weekend's Evo 2023 fighting game tournament, we received a host of new announcements, including new characters added to the roster of the upcoming Mortal Kombat 1 and even a surprise TMNT collaboration with Street Fighter 6. However, Capcom didn't stop there, as it gave us the first teaser trailer for its 20th playable character, A.K.I.\nDescribed as \"a manaical poison aficionado,\" A.K.I. certainly seems to fit right in with the long lineage of over-the-top and deranged characters within the Street Fighter universe. You can check out the surprisingly dark teaser trailer for A.K.I. below.\n\n\nWhile we already knew A.K.I. was planned, the teaser comes hot on the heels of the release of Rashid, the first DLC character for Street Fighter 6. Rashid debuted in Street Fighter V, but joined the roster of Street Fighter 6 less than two weeks prior to this teaser. A.K.I. arrives in Street Fighter 6 this fall. Both characters – as well as the two remaining members of Year 1, Ed and Akuma – are included in the Deluxe Edition, Ultimate Edition, or Year 1 Character Pass. Rashid is also currently available for individual purchase for 350 Fighter Coins (approximately $7). Regardless of how you obtain Rashid, you also get his secondary outfit and two additional color options. It stands to reason that A.K.I. will follow a similar release method. \nFor more on Street Fighter 6, check out our glowing review of the game, as well as our cover story. If you're new to the Street Fighter franchise, you can get caught up with our history of the series' first 30 years right here.",

          "description": "Mortal Kombat 1’s roster continues to expand, and the latest trailer reveals a returning staple and two long-lost fighters from the series’ 2000s era: Reptile, Ashrah, and Havik.\nThe lengthy trailer provides a great look at the new looks and abilities of each character as well as their respective roles in the story. Reptile is back in his more human form but can still shapeshift into his natural, intimidating lizard body to devour opponents.  \nFans of 2004’s Mortal Kombat: Deception should be happy to see the returns of Ashrah and Havik. Each made their debut in that game, and neither has appeared in the series since Deception’s follow-up, Mortal Kombat: Armageddon in 2006. Ashrah sports a much different look and moveset but remains a demoness mostly cleansed of her inherent evil. Havik appears to retain his chaotic brand of body-contorting, limb-tearing offense. Sareena has also been confirmed as a new Kameo fighter to fan the flame of 2000s nostalgia. Check out the new trailer and a fresh batch of screenshots below. \n\n\n       \n\nMortal Kombat 1 launches on September 19 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.

In this world – Ziêminal – there's no good and no evil; just monsters and enemies in your way. And if today's Deathbound trailer is anything to go on, they won't go down without a fight. \nCheck out the Deathbound reveal trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see in the trailer above, players can freely switch between various heroes of different classes in a party at any time, and they'll need to do so to survive in specific situations. Trialforge Studio calls this a \"Binding System, allowing players to absorb the essence of the fallen warriors found throughout the world.\" Using the collected essence, players can obtain new skills and abilities to transform their playstyle, or they can use it to form a party of heroes they can then switch between. \nBinding also unlocks Morphstrikes, which combines all of a party's power into a devastating blow. \n\n\"The memories and identities of the fallen will be uncovered through Binding as well,\" a press release reads. \"In addition to environment and items, essence will reveal the narrative behind the world of Ziêminal and its inhabitants. Though players must tread carefully when Binding, as not all heroes converge harmoniously. The conflicts caused by divergent essences absorbed will greatly impact the gameplay and narrative alike.\" \nDeathbound is due out sometime in 2024 on Steam.",

The game’s eerie atmosphere and lack of dialogue lend to the game’s enigmatic nature, and multiple endings offer various truths about the threat you face.\n\n\nSomerville launched for Xbox and PC last November to generally warm reviews, though was noted for its rough technical performance, which has since been improved in post-launch updates.

          "description": "Striking Distance Studios, the studio behind last year’s action horror title The Callisto Protocol, has suffered layoffs.\nIt’s been confirmed via IGN that 32 employees have been let go from the studio. These include production coordinator Sebastian Marlow, associate producer Nora Falcon, senior environment artist Matthew Smith, and VFX artist Matt Christopherson. \nA spokesperson for Krafton, Striking Distance’s parent company, gave the following statement to IGN: \n“Striking Distance Studios and Krafton have implemented strategic changes that realign the studio’s priorities to better position its current and future projects for success. Unfortunately, these changes have impacted 32 employees. Honoring the invaluable contributions of each departing team member with material support in the form of outplacement services and meaningful severance packages is our top priority during this difficult moment.”\nStriking Distance was founded in 2019 by Dead Space co-creator Glen Schofield alongside industry veterans. The Callisto Protocol was its first title, released in December 2022. Set in a prison on Jupiter’s moon of Callisto in 2320, it follows an inmate’s escape following an alien outbreak. The game received a mixed reception from critics and players; we scored it a 6 out of 10 in our review. It was reported in January that The Callisto Protocol underperformed in sales compared to its reportedly massive budget. \nThe Callisto Protocol’s story expansion, Final Transmission, was released on June 28.  \n[Source: IGN]",

However, if you’ve been paying attention to the Call of Duty space, it’s no surprise that this year’s Call of Duty is Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. It’s leaked in various ways already, including on special Monster energy drink packaging (thanks, CharlieIntel). \nJokes on you, real key art here.\npic.twitter.com/UCCexH7IMr\nAugust 2, 2023\nAs you can see, the official Call of Duty Twitter account says, “We’ll share our artistic abilities and even more next week,” alongside fake key art poking fun at redacted Modern Warfare III information leaking ahead of its official reveal. This aligns with a recent Modern Warfare II Season 5 blog post, which announced that the next Call of Duty would be revealed in-game through a “special event.” \nIt seems that reveal is happening next week, although when or how remains unclear. Interestingly, the reveal of a new Call of Duty releasing this year contrasts with reports from early last year stating Call of Duty would skip 2023. \nIn the meantime, read how Lara Croft, Nicki Minaj, Snoop Dogg, and 21 Savage are coming to Modern Warfare II and Warzone, and then read Game Informer’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II review.

          "description": "Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson has revealed that the publisher is working on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One ports of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.\nHe did so during EA’s company Q1 earnings call yesterday, as reported by The Verge. Survivor launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC earlier this year, in April, and received critical acclaim – Game Informer gave it a 9.25, making it a must-play game. But it skipped the PS4 and Xbox One generation that its predecessor, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, launched on. \n\n\n“Thanks to the strength of this legendary franchise and community demand, our development team has committed to bringing this Jedi experience to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,” Wilson said during the call, according to The Verge. \nFallen Order launched on PS4 and Xbox One with some technical difficulties, and while Survivor wasn’t perfect on that front, it performed a lot better on the now current-gen hardware. It will be interesting to see how it performs on the previous-gen hardware that Fallen Order had difficulties with. As for when to expect this Survivor port, it sounds like it could be a while because IGN reports that Wilson said the port is “in the early stages of development.” \nWhile waiting for it to hit PS4 and Xbox One one day, read Game Informer’s Star Wars Jedi: Survivor review and then read about how the game’s director wants the series to be a trilogy. Watch our video interview with Cal Kestis actor Cameron Monaghan about the sequel after that. \n[Source: The Verge]\nAre you waiting to play Star Wars Jedi: Survivor on PS4 or Xbox One?

          "description": "Nintendo’s next console will reportedly be portable like the Switch and is targeting a release in the second half of 2024, according to a new report today from VideoGamesChronicle. \nVGC cites “multiple people with knowledge of Nintendo’s next-gen console plans” that reveal Nintendo’s Switch successor is aiming for a release in the second half of next year, to ensure there’s plenty of stock at launch. Nintendo wants to avoid the stock shortages that plagued the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S release for months (and years for some). \n\n\nThe publication reports that two of its sources suggest the next-generation console will use LCD screens, like those seen on the launch versions of the Switch, rather than the OLED screens used in the Switch OLED models. The use of LCD reduces costs, VGC writes, in light of the likely need for significantly more storage than what’s in the Switch, which will increase costs. \nVGC’s sources also suggest Nintendo’s next console will be playable on the go, similar to the Switch’s console-handheld hybrid nature. Its sources also say the console will continue using physical cartridges like the Switch, although it’s unclear if this console will be backwards compatible with the Switch.\nIn February of last year, Nintendo said the Switch was in the middle of its lifecycle, meaning that while a new Nintendo console might launch next year, the company might not necessarily abandon the Switch any time soon. However, if Nintendo continues support of the Switch alongside a next-gen console, it’s unclear how that will work as, presumably, this new console will be a good bit more powerful than the Switch. \nRegardless of how Nintendo approaches Switch support following the release of a new console and backwards compatibility, the Super Mario Bros. maker likely wants to convert the Switch’s massive install base into its following product. \n[Source: VideoGamesChronicle]\nWhat do you want from a next-gen Nintendo console?

The Xbox version of Final Fantasy XIV is expected sometime during the spring of 2024. Before the release of 7.0 and during Patch 6.5X, there will be an open beta scheduled for the Xbox version. \nThis means the Dawntrail expansion will be playable on Xbox Series X/S at launch. Like with other platforms, Final Fantasy XIV will only be available as a digital release on Xbox. You can go straight from the Open Beta to the full version, too, as saved data and progress transfer over. \nFor more about Final Fantasy XIV, watch the reveal trailer for Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail and then read Game Informer's Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker review. \nAre you going to be checking out Final Fantasy XIV on Xbox Series X/S?

Where Endwalker was dark, with the end of the universe on the line, Dawntrail is brighter and seemingly lighter in tone. \n“It’s a new beginning of Final Fantasy XIV [and] the theme is a journey of discovery. As you know, the arc we’ve been on from 1.0 to Endwalker about Hydaelyn and Zodiark has concluded.

In February, the console maker announced it had shipped 32 million units in the PS5’s lifetime, which means in just five months, Sony has sold at least 8 million more consoles. \n\n\nThat’s a significant jump, especially given that it’s been somewhat of a quieter year for Sony so far. There’s no doubt the release of God of War Ragnarok last winter pushed PS5 sales, helping it reach that 32 million mark, but since then, the only first-party PlayStation release for PS5 has been Horizon Forbidden West’s Burning Shores DLC and MLB The Show 23. Horizon Call of the Mountain is also a first-party game released this year but it's exclusive to PSVR2.\nHowever, Square Enix released Final Fantasy XVI last month exclusively on PS5, so while not a first-party game, it likely further pushed console sales. Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, which is getting its own special limited edition PS5 console bundle, will likely lead to more hardware sales as well.\n\n\nSEI President and CEO Jim Ryan discusses this milestone marker for the PS5 in a new statement released today. Below is a portion of it: \n\n\nFor more, read Game Informer’s PlayStation 5 review to find out why we love the console, and then check out Game Informer’s list of the top 10 best PS5 games after that. \nDo you have a PS5?

          "description": "A little while has passed since the release of 2.7.0, and we are now excited to present you with the bugfix release 2.7.1.\nWe have included a significant amount of fixes and small improvements, in particular:\nAdded ScummVM Log file viewer, so you can easily report the problems on platforms with limited file access, e.g. Android, iOS or even modern Windows.\nFixed the shader-based scaler loading on some platforms.\nAdded multiple improvements to AGI, AGS, Cryomni3D and 12 more engines.\nWe also improved the detection of Broken Sword 1 & Broken Sword 2, so more original versions get properly detected. Thank you to those who submitted bug reports about this, and if you still locate a version that is not recognised, please report it to us (beware that the frankenstein versions that are floating around the internet will not be accepted, only those copied from the original media).\nFor the full and comprehensive list of notable changes, please refer to the Release Notes.\nIf you are as excited about the release as we are, you can share our joy by downloading it from our downloads page. If you are using Windows, macOS, or either of the Ubuntu Snap or Flatpack packages, the autoupdater will pick up the ScummVM 2.7.1 release automatically.

          "description": "Adibou, the first game in the beloved children's series, is now ready for public testing!\nAlso known as Adi Jr.'s World of Discoveries, this 1991 Coktel Vision title began the educational Adibou collection aimed at children of age 4 to 7 years.\nMany of the iconic activities and mechanisms of the series were already part of this first opus: planting flowers, playing the game Breakout, and being rewarded with sweets upon completing Read/Count exercises. And of course, this was Adibou's first appearance! Although the floppy release has him speak the same strange gibberish as heard in the Goblins series, he is still the patient and funny learning partner that he's remembered for being in later games.\nScummVM supports all of the game's releases, from the initial 16-color floppy ones to later 1994 CD versions with richer graphics and sound effects. So dig out your dusty Adibou disks, get a ScummVM daily development build, and start collecting sweets while completing math and reading exercises! Please also contact us if you own a version ScummVM is not yet aware of, and report to the issue tracker any problem you may encounter.\nAs much as ScummVM aims to replicate the original gaming experience, there is one feature we are unfortunately unable to support. When hardworking children complete their virtual sweets collection, a message invites them to mail a floppy disk with their savegame to Coktel Vision, who would send them a parcel containing Coktel goodies and actual sweets! So if you are introducing children to Adibou through ScummVM, be prepared to go to the nearest shop and buy some candy for when they finish the game!\n>",
