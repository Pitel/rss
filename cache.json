The game isn't set to come our way until 8th August, but to keep us going until then, the publisher has revealed the opening movie in all its animated glory.\nIf you were wondering how closely the game will stick to its anime source material, we'd wager that this opening movie will give you a hint. Fans of the anime will see more than a few familiar faces here, but the game promises new storylines and characters from author Fuse so there will still be a few surprises along the way.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Those puzzles aren’t even all original either—if you really want to be pedantic, the Mega Picross puzzles are usually repeats.\nBut it’s all going to be okay now. After the success of a Sega-themed Picross S Genesis & Master System Edition release a few years ago, Jupiter has now committed to another crossover, this time borrowing from Namco’s extensive arcade history with Picross S Namco Legendary Edition. What does this mean for you? Well, it’s another few hundred puzzles to complete, but this time some of them might have Pac-Man characters.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "To kick off with some extremely half-arsed mytho-geometry, the original Frostpunk was a testament to both the design utility and the inexhaustible political symbolism of circles. When people wish to found a community of equals they commonly form a circle, with each participant visible and audible to the rest. A circle is also the best shape for defending against an engulfing ambient threat such as a global ice age, because it has no weak points, and it makes a great centrepiece for a videogame interface, a symmetrical motif that can be tuned and adorned to either suck your attention into the screen or distribute it evenly in all directions.\nCreated by Polish developers 11 bit, Frostpunk takes place in the middle of a circle, an Arctic crater with a huge coal generator at its heart. Your city rises in rings around that generator, each additional layer of dwellings corresponding intuitively to decreasing temperature, and the result is one of the most focused and thematically consistent specimens of its genre - a building game that feels as intimate and urgent as tending a campfire. Frostpunk 2's new campaign mode breaks the circle open. It starts where you (hopefully) ended, with the crater now fully colonised and evolved into a glaring, blue-orange geode of high-density housing and clustered chimneys. But the view has been pulled back, and construction now unfolds along the plains and canyons beyond the crater, which consist not of circles but of hexagons - another UI designer's favourite - on which you'll plot out upgradeable districts rather than assembling individual buildings. \r\n \nRead more",

But it's not to last, of course: Gorion is murdered, and you must rove the Sword Coast in pursuit of his killer.

It’s so focused on looking pretty that it hasn’t even noticed the title and subtitle got mixed up.\nSure enough, Hellblade 2 is a harsh test for older hardware, with a heavy reliance on DLSS or FSR upscaling to keep performance sweet. That said, it’s no Dragons Dogma 2-style technical horrorshow either.

Liam has created a spreadsheet of things we're ticking off to prepare for the upcoming expansion, and I think it's the perfect summation of what the game is to us: something that makes no sense at all and yet something that makes our brains hum with happiness.\nAnd what we've found with Destiny, in all of its bloat, is that we haven't explored for a single second since our return. Everything is accomplished through menus, making it quite Starfield-esque, which is terrible… but also good. We can't make sense of it and we don't think we ever will.\nRead more",

Soon you bump into a ghostly girl, who guides you to a tower that thrusts you both up to a higher plane - but though she ascends, you're dragged back to the bottom at the last moment by some netherworldly chains.

I mean it as a distinction between those games that let you plop down a house, and others that need you to stack the bricks, install the plumbing, fit the lights, and select the wallpaper. The first Prison Architect allowed you to finesse every detail of a secure correctional facility, down to each cell and dog kennel. Unsurprisingly for a sim about prison, it encouraged obsessive control. The 3D-ified sequel isn't finished yet, but it's taking a similar approach. Maybe a little too similar.\nRead more",

The core one though, is that it takes the kind of simulationist foundation normally reserved for the punishing Dwarf Fortress derivatives or gnarly logistics games, and builds on them an approachable, gentle, even philosophical game instead.

Lorelei, despite its single-solution puzzles, is not dictatorial. It’s far too interested in collaborating with you for that. It wants you to observe, consider, and interpret its many mysteries. What’s really hooked me here is how those puzzles are kept coherent and logical, despite you getting delivered a letter by dog and occasionally visiting a floppy disk bizzaro world where you converse with a magician who manifests from his own discarded hat.\nRead more",

          "description": "I've clocked up nearly 400 hours playing BioWare's big fantasy RPG Dragon Age: Inquisition, which is not a stat I'm particularly proud of. I'm not ashamed either, partly because, as has been identified by artist Corey Brickley, via the Maw, there's a lot of filler. Brickley has collated a list of suggested mods to slim down Dragon Age: Inquisition from a potentially 80 hours-long epic to a trim 40 hour story-focused romp, which means you might be able to play through it again in time for the launch of Dragon Age: Dreadwolf - which is a direct sequel to Inquisition.\nI find this list of mods interesting! It's a way to change the game quite substantially without exactly transforming it, and it's very in-keeping with my campaign to make games 60% smaller. Still, there's at least one item on there I'd push back on, but also this isn't really a new problem for Dragon Age as a series.\nRead more",

Nicméně, občas je úložiště potřeba a přesně o tom bude další Cloud Native Prague meetup s tématem zvaným Stateful Kubernetes.",

          "description": "Covert Sneakers are widely considered the best Boots in Modern Warfare 3, so Sledgehammer Games responded in Season 4 by decreasing the volume of enemy footsteps to devalue using the perk. \n\n\nAs part of the Season 4 update, all enemies have quieter footsteps. Since Covert Sneakers eliminates footstep audio, it's rendered redundant, considering everyone makes less noise. This comes after Sledgehammer Games already attempted to overhaul the Boots category in Season 3 Reloaded. \n\n\nThe developer removed Climbing Boots and introduced All-Terrain Boots, which offer significantly increased movement speed at the cost of tactical sprinting. In addition, Running Sneakers received a buff to improve sprint to fire time by 25 percent while tactical sprinting, and Stalker Boots were buffed to increase strafe speed and decreased the bounciness of aiming down sight. Those changes didn't do enough to satisfy the development team. \n\n\nImage via Activision\n\n\n\"Last season, we made several adjustments to Perks to distribute usage in the Boots category more evenly,\" Sledgehammer Games said. \"Despite these changes, the pick rate of Covert Sneakers remains far ahead of other Boots.\" \n\n\nAfter this Season 4 change and the buffs from a previous update, there are plenty of compelling options worth considering. Taking everything into consideration, the best Boots option is now Stalker Boots as they give you faster strafing and ADS speed. Running Sneakers are also a viable choice as they increase tactical sprinting duration and reduce the refresh time.\n\n\nThe indirect nerf to Covert Sneakers will also impact the Call of Duty League. Reports suggest that Major 4 will be played on the latest patch, meaning we could see pro players experiment with other perks. Either way, the next time you load into a match, don't be afraid to try out a new Boots option.\n\nThe post MW3 Season 4 change pushes players away from using Covert Sneakers appeared first on Destructoid.",

She can be a great fit with other items like Alex Morgan and Sophia Smith, who are available in different packs. To get this card, you'll have to complete Huerta's SBC before it expires from Ultimate Team. \n\n\nWhat are the EA FC 24 Sofia Huerta TOTS SBC tasks?\n\n\nThe latest TOTS SBC is extremely easy to complete, as it has only one task. The solo task does have certain conditions, but this is a perfect challenge to complete for beginners. \n\n\nTask 1 - Sofia Huerta\n\n\n\nMin. 1 Players: Any TOTS or TOTW\n\n\nMin. Team Rating: 83\n\n\n\nYou'll need to use at least one TOTS or TOTW item, and my suggestion will be to use the latter. The 83+ TOTW Pick SBC allows players to craft as many items as they want in exchange for lower-rated fodder. TOTS items have higher ratings, and are far more expensive to get. It's best to save them for SBCs that require higher-rated squads. \n\n\nImage via EA Sports\n\n\nEA FC 24 Sofia Huerta TOTS SBC Cheapest Solutions\n\n\nWhile there's just one task, always go for the cheapest solution.

Here's how to beat it with no wasted time searching.\n\n\nWhere to find the final pair of switches in Destiny 2 Zero Hour\n\n\nJust like the previous two quests in this chain, you'll need to speak with Ada-1 in the Tower's Annex to acquire the Outbreak Refined III quest.

However, something must be said about a well-balanced weapon that is easy to use. \n\n\nTime-to-kill speed is not a strength of the MP5A2. According to TrueGameData, the Vector, MP7, and P90 kill faster than the MP5A2 from most ranges, and it's not particularly close in short-range engagements. Thankfully, a class-leading ADS time and impressive sprint-to-fire time make up for that shortcoming.

          "description": "The Euro 2024 promo could be a surprise hit with EA FC 24 Ultimate Team players and breathe new life into it following the TOTS celebrations.\n\n\nEuro 2024 will kick off in June and pit the best of Europe against each other. To celebrate this special tournament, EA Sports is reportedly planning to release an exclusive promo in Ultimate Team. While the developers have remained tight-lipped as of this writing, FUT Scoreboard, a reliable source for leaks in the past, has provided the information on X.\n\n\nWhen will the Euro 2024 promo release in EA FC 24?\n\n\nFor now, it's all speculation, but our best guess places a Euro 24 promo for EA FC 24 on June 14. The actual Euro 2024 begins on June 14, too, with the first contest featuring Germany and Scotland. We're assuming it'll go live around the same time, putting it a week after the EA FC 24 TOTS promo ends on June 7.\n\n\nAs things stand, it's unclear what plans EA Sports has for the unique promo. The upcoming set of cards could create the same frenzy we saw earlier in FIFA 23 when the World Cup-themed items were released. For the time being, it's best to wait patiently until EA Sports makes the news official. \n\n\n\n\nThere haven't been many rumors so far, as the TOTS promo is active. However, the leaks indicate that the Euro 2024 promo could have its own versions of Heroes and Icons. The Heroes and Icons are always pretty popular, and a new version will certainly incentivize many players to continue playing after the TOTS promo.\n\n\nIt will be interesting to find out which footballers will get unique cards in EA FC 24 as part of the Euro promo. For the time being, players can start preparing for the Ultimate TOTS promo, which goes live on Friday, May 31. It will feature some of the best rewards from the previous TOTS lineups and give the community a great chance to get their hands on some really strong items.\n\nThe post Will EA FC 24 have a Euro 2024 promo? appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A new trailer for the second season of NieR: Automata Ver1.1a just dropped, bringing exciting new information about the second course of NieR: Automata's beautiful but beleaguered anime adaptation to the series' fans. Among these new tidbits was an estimated release window of July 2024.\n\n\nCarrying the weight of the world\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the trailer, which premiered simultaneously on X and Aniplex's official YouTube page, the second season of NieR: Automata Ver1.1a will premiere sometime in July of this year. If the first season of NieR: Automata Ver1.1a is anything to go off of, the second season will feature a total of twelve episodes, meaning that its run will probably wrap up in either August or September, depending on when in July it premieres.\n\n\nWhile the second season is currently set to be released in the summer, NieR: Automata Ver1.1a developed a reputation for its production schedule. The first season was infamously marred with COVID-related production issues that caused it to be delayed twice, so NieR fans have a right to be a little skeptical about the schedule for the second phase of 2B and 9S's adventures.\n\n\nThe first season of NieR: Automata Ver1.1a adapted a version of the game's story through Endings A and B, which are only two of the five endings that players need to arrive at to gain a complete understanding of NieR's events. Given what we see in the trailer, the second cour will likely adapt Endings C through E, which completely flip the story of NieR: Automata on its head and turn what appears to be a story of humanoid androids warring against robots into something a bit more complicated.\n\nThe post NieR: Automata anime’s second season slots in for July premiere appeared first on Destructoid.",

Lobby kickers have been an issue for the Helldivers 2 community, but a solution is being worked on. \n\n\nAt least one is according to Arrowhead Games community manager, Thomas \"Twinbeard\" Petersson. Last week, in a reply on the game's official Discord to a question about what to do with \"arsehole lobby\" kickers, Petersson said the team is figuring something out. \n\n\n\"We're actually working on a solution to mitigate problems with, well, 'getting kicked by an arsehole lobby leader' as someone once eloquently put it,\" Petersson said. \"No ETA on that, but it's coming.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA solution to butthead lobby kickers is coming to Helldivers 2\n\n\nThe lobby kicker issue has been a thorn for community members for some time. I've read complaints about it on the official Helldivers 2 subreddit since the game arrived. There are no penalties for kicking players without a reason in the game; in fact, it's relatively easy to do. I've been kicked from games before, but thankfully it wasn't due to a griefing lobby leader. At least a few have the courtesy to let you know first. \n\n\n\n\n\nJohan Pilestedt, the CCO of Arrowhead Games, commented on the situation before. In a message on X back in March, Pilestedt said the issue was \"very hard to solve - we have some ideas but no conclusion.\" Pilestedt continued, asking for ideas from the community \"Hive Mind.\"\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps one of those ideas shared to the team was good enough to work on. Some have suggested offering kicked players some share in the experience points and Reference Slips — one ideal solution. It's been a couple of months since the aforementioned message, and it doesn't sound like the fix is around the corner. But, hopefully, it's close. \n\nThe post A solution to deal with Helldivers 2 lobby kickers is on its way appeared first on Destructoid.",

The less-than-heroic superhero becomes available for Kombat Pack owners on June 4 and for everyone else on June 11.\nThe patriotic and maniacal leader of The Seven shows no quarter to his new MK adversaries, obliterating them with an offensive style that is very reminiscent of Superman’s playstyle in the Injustice series. The trailer also shows off the new DLC Kameo fighter Ferra, the smaller, more feral half of the Ferra & Torr team from Mortal Kombat X, who also joins the game sometime in June. \n\n\nHomelander joins Peacemaker, Invincible’s Omni-Man, Ermac, Quan-Chi, and the upcoming Takeda in the Year 1 DLC roster. Mortal Kombat 1 also has a story expansion on the way, but there’s still no word on what that will entail or when it will arrive. \nFor more on Mortal Kombat 1, check out our review of the game here.",

          "description": "Hive Jump 2: Survivors arrives in Steam Early Access today. To celebrate, publisher Midwest Games and developer Graphite Lab have shared an exclusive trailer for the Survivors-like sequel. The first Hive Jump caught our eye way back in 2015 when we named it one of the most promising indie titles on display at PAX West that year before its launch in 2017. The original Hive Jump served as a four-player co-op homage to Super Metroid, but Hive Jump 2: Survivors takes inspiration from a different title: Vampire Survivors.\nThe genre, called \"bullet heaven,\" puts players in the shoes of a single character who eventually builds up to become extremely powerful as the waves of enemies grow more intense. Hive Jump 2: Survivors carries forward the look of its Metroidvania predecessor but from the genre-standard top-down perspective. You take control of a lone survivor of an alien attack who must now face seemingly insurmountable odds to survive. You can customize your loadout and upgrade your jetpack to destroy enemies and escape tough situations.\nThe jetpack also allows you to traverse the levels in ways not available in Vampire Survivors. The Jumpers have specific builds that allow you to cater to your play style, which combines with the upgrades you select before each run. You can play with auto-assist aiming or switch to manual controls. If you can survive 14 rounds, you can challenge big boss battles. As you collect goo from fallen enemies, you can earn better weapons, upgrades, and relics to improve your odds. Meanwhile, amber you find in the field can be traded for permanent upgrades to stats, magnets for auto-scavenging, or even screen-wiping nukes.\nYou can see an exclusive look at the Early Access launch trailer below.\n\n\nHive Jump 2: Survivors launches into Steam Early Access today. For more on the work produced by Graphite Lab, check out our review of their 2023 2D platformer, Mr. Run and Jump, here.",

This would make it the perfect candidate to launch on Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft's gaming subscription service, in order to bring new subscribers in. Black Ops 6 was officially revealed last week, and while it was reported to be in consideration for a Game Pass launch, today, the news was confirmed from Xbox itself. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will launch on Game Pass day one.\nWe don't know much about the game yet, but two live-action teasers have been released so far. The first features a group of people covering the faces of Mount Rushmore with blindfolds that say, \"The truth lies.\" The second, released today, can be seen below.\n\n\nIt features world leaders' black and white camera footage speaking in hushed tones about a grand conspiracy about manufactured wars and the elusive nature of the truth. The trailer ends with the game's full title, along with a reminder that the full reveal will come on June 9, after Xbox's summer showcase.\nFor more Call of Duty, check out our reviews for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III and Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War.",

Silent Hill Ascension, the online mobile narrative game where players dictated the story choices, also finished up its first season (though the developer may have a different term for it), so it's possible we may learn what's next for that game.",

It had a simple premise: Your character flees through a crumbling urban landscape, making great leaps across rooftops at the touch of your phone screen. It met great success and charted in what was then only a burgeoning mobile game ecosystem. Canabalt popularized the infinite runner genre and would ultimately put its designer, Adam Saltsman, on the map.\nNow working under the name of Finji as its creative director, Adam’s rise as a designer as well as his partner’s, Bekah Saltsman, as both a publisher and CEO, has been stunning to watch, especially considering the simplicity of that first big hit.

Released in 2007 for the PlayStation 3, the game featured Andy Serkis just a few years removed from his work on the Lord of the Rings films, and is a weird action game that has incredible moments of action that doesn't last quite as long as you'd like. It's a special game to me, however, and one I am always happy to revisit. I am pessimistic, but I would love to play a version of the game at 60 FPS.\n\n\nIf you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

Following that March reveal, developer A Heartful of Games and publisher Outright Games has largely gone quiet. Today, the publisher revealed what players can expect from the Deluxe and Collector's Editions of Mutants Unleashed if they want to splurge on the game when it arrives later this year.\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed allows you to take control of the four turtles in a 3D brawler/platformer for up to two players. The premium editions of the game will provide additional physical goodies for fans of the franchise. The Deluxe Edition includes the game, an exclusive steelbook, four pin badges, four keychains, and an artbook. Meanwhile, the Collector's Edition includes the game, Season Pass, pizza van statue, LED sign, five pin badges, four patches, a mouse mat, notebook, pen, artbook, poster, stickers, and a collector's box. The Deluxe Edition retails for $60, while the Collector's Edition will set you back $200.\nOddly enough, both the Deluxe and Collector's Editions are exclusive to the PlayStation 5 and Switch versions of the game. If you're not planning to experience this title on those systems, but still want to at least play through the game, you're in luck, as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleahsed arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC later this year.\nFor more on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in video games, be sure to read our in-depth feature on the history of the video game franchise here, and if you want something else to look forward to, read a comment from TMNT co-creator Kevin Eastman on the upcoming video game based on The Last Ronin here.",

While the prime example on everyone's mind is likely Xbox's recent acquisition of Activision Blizzard, several have already occurred in 2024. The latest was announced today by Atari, which confirmed it is acquiring its longtime rival, Intellivision.\nAtari announced it has purchased the Intellivision brand and more than 200 games from Intellvision Entertainment. As part of the deal, Intellivision Entertainment will rebrand and continue developing and distributing the Amico game console with a license from Atari to distribute new versions of Intellivision games on the console. Atari will also look to expand digital and physical distribution of legacy Intellivision games, potentially create new games, and explore licensing opportunities. \n\"This was a very rare opportunity to unite former competitors and bring together fans of Atari, Intellivision, and the golden age of gaming,\" chairman and CEO of Atari Wade Rosen said in a press release. \n\"Atari has been a valuable partner and we have every confidence they will be a responsible steward of the storied Intellvision brand,\" CEO of Intellivision Entertainment Phil Adam said. \"We look forward to our expanded collaboration and bringing a broad array of new Atari and Intellivision titles to the Amico and Amico Home family gaming platforms.\"\nAtari has been experiencing a bit of a re-emergence in the public consciousness lately. In addition to other acquisitions, such as Nightdive Studios and Digital Eclipse, Atari has also published well-received games like Mr. Run and Jump and Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration. For more on Atari's outlook and current strategy, be sure to listen to a 2023 episode of All Things Nintendo, which featured an in-depth conversation with Wade Rosen right here.",

          "description": "When Xbox revealed the date of its summer showcase, it included a mysterious teaser. Immediately following the presentation, there will be a second livestream to highlight an upcoming game in a \"beloved\" series. Today, the subject of that showcase has been revealed, and surprising no one, it's a new Call of Duty game.\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 6 is a title that might confuse some, seeing as there technically isn't a game titled Black Ops 5. This is because the fifth entry of the sub-series, which launched in 2021, was Black Ops Cold War, temporarily removing the numbered naming convention. The news was announced on social media, but was accompanied by a teaser on YouTube that seems to hint at the events of the game's campaign.\n\n\nThe 40-second clip follows a group of people sneaking onto the top of Mount Rushmore, where they place blindfolds over the eyes of the presidents carved into the mountainside. The first three blindfolds read, \"The truth lies,\" while the fourth features a three-headed wolf logo that was used in the initial redacted teaser of the game.\nThe game will be revealed in full during a presentation on Saturday, June 9, immediately following the Xbox showcase that will start at 10 AM PT/ 1 PM ET. Microsoft is reportedly debating on whether or not the launch the game on Game Pass.\nWhat are you hoping to see from the newest Call of Duty? Let us know in the comments!",

Today, Netflix released the first teaser trailer for Season 4 giving fans their first look at Hemsworth in the role.\n\n\nUnfortunately, Hemsworth doesn’t speak in the brief clip, so we still don’t know how his Geralt voice compares to Cavill’s (or the games, for that matter). But he definitely doesn’t look out of place as the White Wolf and, hopefully, won’t be too much of a distraction in this new season.\nSeason 4 is currently in production in the UK and will be filmed back-to-back with Season 5, which will also be the show's finale. It has no release date but is speculated to premiere in 2025. These last two seasons will cover the three remaining Witcher books: Baptism of Fire, The Tower of the Swallow, and Lady of the Lake. The returning cast includes Anya Chalotra (Yennifer) and Freya Allan (Ciri). \nFor more on The Witcher games, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt got its official PC mod tools this week.

          "description": "Crytek has announced the release date for Hunt: Showdown’s new-gen update, which will also conclude support for the current console versions. This update was first announced last September and will essentially force last-gen players to migrate to current consoles to continue playing the popular shooter. \nIn a developer update, general manager David Fifield announced that the CryEngine 5.11 Update will go live on August 15. This update is treated as a “significant relaunch” that brings native PS5/Xbox Series X/S support along with a host of technical improvements. However, it also means the PS4 and Xbox One versions will become unplayable.\nThat means these players must upgrade to current hardware to continue playing their copies of the game. Crytek assures these players that if they decide to upgrade, player accounts, entitlements, and all owned DLC will transfer to the new-gen version for no extra cost. \n\n\nIn addition to technical improvements, the 5.11 Update also introduces a new map and biome. In the months leading to 5.11’s launch, Crytek plans to address community and survey feedback. That includes improved reporting systems to address cheating and toxic player behavior, design reworks tackling hunter revival, health chunks, restorations, burning down hunters, and reducing stalemates. The game is also getting a new user interface, and Crytek will continue evolving the game's recruitment and prestige progression requirements. \nHunt: Showdown first launched for Xbox and PC in 2019, with the PS4 version arriving in 2020. The PvPvE first-person shooter is set in 1865 Louisiana as players, either alone or with two or three friends, hunt supernatural bounties in the bayou while fending off other player-controlled bounty hunters. \nFor more on Crytek, you can read about the studio's next big project, Crysis 4.",

This trailer arrives just a few weeks after we learned MultiVersus finally (re)launches next week. \nAfter roughly two minutes of MultiVersus hijinks with various characters from the game, the Joker, which we recently learned is joining the game with a voice by Mark Hamill, is seen sitting on the Iron Throne of Game of Thrones fame. Then, mysteriously, Jason and Agent Smith appear beside him, likely alluding to them joining the launch day roster. \nCheck it out for yourself in the MultiVersus launch trailer below: \n\n\nMultiVersus is a free-to-play game and will launch on May 28 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. \nFor more, read Game Informer's MultiVersus review after its first launch back in 2022, and then check out Joker's MultiVersus gameplay and his Batman Who Laughs alternate costume. \nAre you jumping back into MultiVersus next week when it launches?

Larian Studios Warsaw is the developer-publisher's seventh studio worldwide, and joins others in Barcelona, Dublin, Gent, Guildford, Kuala Lumpur, and Quebec. \n\"With two very ambitious RPGs now starting development, what better way to see our visions realized than by growing our team and opening a 7th studio in the heart of Poland's lively gaming scene,\" the company's announcement post on X (formerly) Twitter reads. \n\n\nAs for what those two RPGs are, don't expect a sequel to Baldur's Gate 3. Despite winning countless awards last year, including Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2023, Larian's CEO revealed back in March that the studio is done with both Baldur's Gate 3 – so no expansions – and the Baldur's Gate series in general. \nOver on a separate blog post about Larian Studios Warsaw, the company talks about its plans with seven worldwide studios open now. \n\"Larian Studios set up base in one of the greatest RPG development hubs in the world – Poland, where we opened our doors in the historic city of Warsaw,\" the blog post reads. \"Like its sister studios across the globe, Larian Studios Warsaw is dedicated to fostering an environment where developers can thrive creatively and reclaim their agency.

Freddy Fazbear and friends will return to the big screen on December 5, 2025.\nAs reported by Variety, Blumhouse Productions announced the date alongside a slate of other upcoming films, including M3GAN 2.0 and The Black Phone 2. It's not surprising to see Five Nights At Freddy’s getting a follow-up. It simultaneously premiered in theaters and on Peacock on October 27, 2023, and still managed to be a massive box office success. Grossing $297 million globally, it became the year's highest-grossing horror film, Blumhouse’s highest-grossing film ever, and the most-watched movie on Peacock for five straight days. \nThe tagline for Five Nights At Freddy's 2 reads, \"Anyone can survive five nights. This time, there will be no second chances.\" The sequel’s cast has not been announced, but the original starred Josh Hutchinson and included Matthew Lillard, Elizabeth Lail, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Piper Rubio. Director Emma Tammi is returning to direct the sequel, with FNAF creator Scott Cawthorn and Blumhouse founder Jason Blum once again assuming producer roles. \nFNAF 2 won't be the only video game film arriving in 2025. Mortal Kombat 2, the sequel to the 2021 reboot film, was recently confirmed to release in October of that year.",

But it seems like the fallout from this recent boom in popularity hasn't died down quite yet. Thanks to a teaser shared on Fortnite's official social media pages, we know that Fallout will be coming to Fortnite pretty soon\npic.twitter.com/AKjFXVnHST\nMay 17, 2024\nThe teaser image shows power armor in a cloud of orange dust, accompanied by what appears to be some sort of industrial building. Other than that, there's not much to go on, but we can make educated guesses. For one, Fortnite's current season will end on May 24, so this is the perfect time to tease the skins that might be coming in the next battle pass. And if it's anything like the recent Avatar: The Last Airbender and Star Wars crossovers, we might see Fallout-themed mechanics or areas appear on the battle royale map itself.\nIt will almost certainly involve some sort of cosmetic pack as well, which could include characters from the games, the Amazon Prime show, or both. Thanks to the teaser, we know power armor will be making an appearance, but it's unclear whether it will be an item to equip in-game or a skin that can be unlocked or purchased.\nFor more Fortnite news, read about its recent crossover with Billie Eilish, its decision to allow players to block certain emotes, and its huge and mysterious collaboration with Disney.\nWhat are you hoping to see included in this crossover?

This follows reports in previous weeks indicating Microsoft and Xbox were mulling over whether or not to launch the next iteration in the franchise on Game Pass, out of fear it might hurt sales. \nAfter acquiring Activision Blizzard for a colossal $69 billion last year, fans and analysts have speculated about how Microsoft will handle the Call of Duty franchise moving forward. It will obviously be a big draw for Xbox Game Pass, pulling in new subscribers, but most every year, the new Call of Duty is the best-selling game of the year – save for last year, where Hogwarts Legacy took that crown – and a Game Pass launch could affect those sales numbers. \n\n\nHowever, this new report from The Wall Street Journal seemingly clears the air around that topic. \n\"Microsoft plans a major shake up of its video game sales strategy by releasing the coming installment of Call of Duty to its subscription service instead of the longtime, lucrative approach of only selling it a la carte,\" the story reads. \nOf course, things could change so we'll see what happens. It's likely we'll be learning what the next Call of Duty game is next month as part of the gaming showcase summer that includes Summer Game Fest, Ubisoft Forward, and an Xbox Games Showcase followed by a secret direct that is probably focused on Call of Duty.\n[Source: The Wall Street Journal]\nWhat setting do you hope the next Call of Duty takes place in?

Fans online are already speculating what it could be, considering some of 2K's biggest franchises are prime for a new game. \nAs for when to expect this new game, the official SGF X (formerly Twitter) account says it will be announced on June 7, during the Summer Game Fest livestream that begins at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET. That's less than a month away so we don't have to speculate too long on what this mystery iteration could be. \n2K plans to reveal the next iteration in one of 2K's biggest and most beloved franchises at @SummerGameFest on Friday, June 7. pic.twitter.com/1vyFXE2N4z\nMay 16, 2024\nWhile there are plenty of 2K franchises that fit the bill, our eyes are on three franchises: Borderlands, Mafia, and BioShock. \nThe last mainline Borderlands entry – Borderlands 3 – hit PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in 2019, and with the live-action Borderlands movie hitting theaters this August, a new game would make sense. However, we did just get New Tales From The Borderlands in 2022, if you're looking for something to play through in that universe. \nOn the Mafia front, the last mainline entry was Mafia III in 2016, although 2K released Mafia: Definitive Edition – a remake – in 2020. And we know the next Mafia game is in development, too, so it might be time for an announcement. \nBioShock has been dormant since BioShock Infinite in 2013, unless you count the 2016 remasters, and we know 2K created Cloud Chamber in 2019 to work on the next entry in the franchise. It's been almost five years since then, so SGF seems like a great moment to announce the next BioShock. Speaking of, here's what we want in a BioShock 4. \nSGF returns to Los Angeles next month, with the live showcase happening on June 7.
