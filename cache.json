It was an issue exacerbated by a fan translation already existing online for those willing to go the emulation route. Neo Geo Pocket Color Selection Vol.2, on the same basis, is equally disappointing.\nThere are ten titles on board this follow-up to Vol.1 — four of which are already available to buy separately on Switch eShop — nicely presented as little cartridges on the menu, each with a variety of options. The language barrier issue affects three titles, one of which is the aforementioned Mega Man Battle & Fighters. The other two are board game King of Fighters: Battle de Paradise, and minigame/sim curio Ganbare Neo Poke-Kun, both of which are fairly well-known to Neo Pocket aficionados as two of the system’s more intriguing titles.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The detailed looks at the update began today with a walkthrough of what we can expect from the game's soon-to-be newest stage, Brinewater Springs.\nThere was a certain amount of location-specific content to be had in the Chill Season announcement, though we didn't get a look at the new map in this much detail. The stage looks to be set in an urban village home to some traditional architecture. There are also slopes and fountains a-plenty here, so the tactic will either be to find a good spot with a Charger up high, or take the dry spots of the arena by force with closer-range weapons.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

While it may have been New Star Soccer which brought the team at New Star Games to our attention in the first place, the Switch port of Retro Bowl cemented our love for its arcade-inflected gameplay and clear appreciation of classic gaming.\nIt was therefore with much anticipation that we heard of the team's plans to release a football (or 'soccer,' if you will) follow-up title, Retro Goal, on Switch this month — just in time for the World Cup, no less. Having previously played the title in its original mobile form, we were excited to see what New Star Games would do to ensure that the Switch port maintained all the retro joy of the original while updating things to work for its new console home.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

While the parents peacefully sleep on, the toddler stirs. Oh no. I instantly expect nothing but the worst for the toddler, seeing whose game I’m playing – developer Jumpship was co-founded by Dino Patti, himself co-founder of Playdead, the studio behind Limbo and Inside. Both aren’t exactly known for treating their child protagonists well.\nSomerville has clear stylistic parallels to Playdead’s work. Its 3D sidescrolling and light puzzle mechanics are similar, and the beautiful lighting effects and minimalist environments have led a lot of people to initially confuse Somerville as a Playdead game.\nRead more",

Gaming PCs are still only computers, after all, and computers break, often and for reasons that may be invisible to the most intensively trained eye. Introduce this volatility to a line of work that involves handling a lot of sometimes heavy, usually expensive equipment, and enjoying those little pleasures will eventually come at a cost.

Billed as a life sim RPG, and with a title that evokes farming, you could be forgiven for expecting something along the lines of Harvest Moon or Stardew Valley, but with more monster biffing. Instead, Harvestella sits firmly in the epic quest camp, with your adventuring being supported by your rural activities.\nAnyone looking to build a pastoral paradise is going to be sorely disappointed, as the farming elements are somewhat rudimentary. Even calling your property a farm is a bit of a stretch. Even after a few upgrades, my plot is more of a large garden, maybe an allotment, if I’m being generous.\nRead more",

But, for lack of a nicer way to put it, I’ll simply say things are looking pretty scary out there, huh? Capitalism is failing, the economy is crumbling, and normal people have nothing left to give. It’s something I've been thinking about a lot lately, but I don’t really talk about it. I keep it all inside, like a microwave holding a ball of tin foil while it spins on full power.\nAt least, that was the case until I played Citizen Sleeper. It’s a rather simple RPG inspired by tabletop roleplaying games, giving you a limited number of action dice that you can spend each day to receive consequences. Mechanically, it doesn’t stretch much further than those actions and consequences, meaning I can instead focus on connecting with characters. In its simplicity, I found a cathartic way to process my thoughts on lots of scary stuff happening in our actual world. I also realised that Starfield, the big space game looming on the horizon which I was previously pretty excited about, just doesn’t seem appealing anymore.\nRead more",

          "description": "Say what you will about Square Enix's ill-fated ventures into NFTs and mildly embarrassing follies with live service games recently. Their commitment to remaking, remastering and generally sprucing up their ageing back catalogue from decades past is an admirable one in my eyes, even if they are making you pay through the nose for them almost every single time. As we all know, though, some have made more successful transitions than others. The dream, of course, at least for me, is the Final Fantasy VII Remake approach for literally everything, no matter how unfeasible, impractical or physically impossible that would be for Squeenix's enormous game library. Alas, the reality is often a lot more modest. Best case scenario: you're a 90s SNES game getting a lovely HD-2D makeover like Live A Live. Next on the rung: some added 3D zhuzh a la Final Fantasy VIII Remastered (although even that was by no means perfect). \nMostly, though, it's your Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster treatment. A welcome update that maintains the look of the originals (albeit with some questionable font choices), but that's more or less your lot. Tactics Ogre: Reborn, a remaster of the 2010 PSP remake of the 1995 SNES original, falls squarely into the latter camp, but you know what? That's fine. It's still a rollicking turn-based tactics game all these years later, and one that definitely deserves to be freed from the shackles of Sony's long-dead handheld, where it's lain dormant for the better part of a decade. Besides, I'll take a fully re-orchestrated soundtrack over slightly fancier pixels any day of the week. You know me. \nRead more",

Both are now discounted from Crampton & Moore via Ebay, with a 25% off coupon (\"FLASH25\") that maxes out at a pretty sweet £150 discount. \nThat means you can pick up the 42-in for £779 and the 48-in model for £848, both of which are the best prices we've ever seen for these highly recommended TVs.\nRead more",

If it’s cluttering my screen, it’s cluttering my mind. Zero regrets. That’s the gamer dopamine hit I’m chasing.\nSo, as you might have guessed, I love the idea of A Little To The Left, a game that celebrates neatness and tidiness through a string of fun puzzles. If you love the satisfaction of arranging books on your shelf in order of height, or displaying your mugs in order of which can hold the most tea, then you’ll love this game too.

You’d think being lucky enough to actually play the damn thing would have numbed my hyper-fixation about it a touch, but, nope. I’m afraid not. It turns out the guy who owns eight physical copies (and four digital) of the original Resident Evil 4 is still pretty excited to play the remake. Who ever could have predicted this?\n\n\r\nThe day my preview went live, Capcom showed off a couple of additional bits as part of a hefty Resident Evil showcase. Alongside a fresh story trailer the company also discussed the various gubbins you’ll receive if you fork out for the game's special edition as well as a short gameplay demonstration. Surprising no one, I’ve watched these clips so many times I now have a load of thoughts that are not only completely useless but are taking up vital brain space I usually reserve for things like pin numbers and dates. If I don’t vent all of this garbage out of my skull there’s a chance I’ll forget my Mam’s birthday again, something that genuinely happened once when I was 17 and I haven’t stopped feeling guilty about it since. I bought her a plant from a Tesco Express three days later thinking that would help. It didn’t. This event haunts me more than any Resident Evil jumpscare ever could.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Death isn’t always this calm and it isn’t always this peaceful, but on rare occasions it can be. \nThis is how developers Florian Veltman and Baptiste Portefaix have approached death in How To Say Goodbye, a cosy game that explores the topic with kindness and sensitivity. With its paper doll illustrations and pastel colour palette, it kinda feels like a children's pop-up book that teaches kids about grief. It’s not overly sweet or patronising, just a gentle game about a group of ghosts who discover how to mourn, how to accept their own death, and how to move on.\nRead more",

          "description": "Ever fancied becoming the bad guy? Well, a new Stranger Things VR game that mixes psychological horror with action is coming from creative studio Tender Claws in 2023, and it casts you as telekinetic monstrosity Vecna. The game’s been commissioned by Netflix, with the series writers involved in creating it. I’m not sure exactly how involved they are, but the trailer is suitably Stranger Things enough that it’s not that big a deal if they just looked at it and went “Yes, fine.” You can watch it for yourself below. \r\n\n \nRead more",

And it tones down the pace of movement too, making for a measured experience that certainly rewards speed, but doesn't make it an athletics competition.\nAnd while the game's multiplayer is a slick refinement of what's come before, its gun unlock process is messy and excessive, even if it offers plenty of options for all types of player.

Ultimate Ninja on. The most recent Naruto title was 2018's Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Strikers, though some of the anime/manga series' spritely sluggers have since joined the roster of crossover characters in Epic Games' battle royale juggernaut Fortnite.\nNo doubt we will be hearing more news on this new Naruto trademark from Bandai Namco at some point in the near future.

Studio Improbable confirms it will shut down Scavengers on December 16, 2022.\nIn an announcement, the team notes that it's been a while since its latest update. The reason for the closure looks to be a slowly dwindling player base for the shooter.\n\"The last few months have seen a decline in the playerbase, and whilst we explored many options to reinvigorate server population while the game is in early access, it became clear that it was unsustainable to continue development and live service,\" the statement reads. \"We’re all proud of what we accomplished, and are grateful to every player who took the time to play, even if it was just for a short while.\"\nThe studio says it plans to celebrate the next few weeks, leading up to the shutdown.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glYYdCz237o\nA jagged, gorgeous winter\nShown off at the 2018 Game Awards, Scavengers was originally in development at Midwinter Entertainment. The team was bought by Improbable in 2019, and Scavengers launched into an early access in 2021.\nIn May, Improbable sold Midwinter to Behaviour Interactive, where the team is now working on an unannounced project. A small team was left to keep Scavengers running, while the console versions were scrapped.

          "description": "It's a real-life Fishbones!\nJinx was already one of the most well-loved and recognizable characters on the League of Legends roster, but after the release of Netflix's Arcane, her popularity has launched into the stratosphere. That kind of mainstream recognition usually means there are some awesome collabs on the way, which is definitely true in this case. This time around, Riot teamed up with Nerf to create a life-sized replica of Jinx's classic blaster known as Fishbones, which was also featured in Arcane, as fans will remember.\nJinx's Fishbones is available for pre-order now (pre-orders close January 1, 2023, and will be shipping on December 31, 2022. The gun is a gargantuan 35 inches long, and features jaws that open and close as you shoot. It holds 18 total darts, shooting out a three round burst every time you pull the trigger. Fishbones also comes with a Jinx-inspired stand and \"display-worthy packaging\" for those who want to show it off for everyone to see. The NERF LMTD League of Legends Jinx Fishbones blaster retails for $169.99, and is available for pre-order on Amazon or directly from Nerf.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC_BXWllD5k\nThe Jinx Fishbones collaboration is part of NERF LMTD, a \" premium, special edition, fan-focused line from the Nerf brand brings you some of the most iconic items from movies, video games, and entertainment with premium features and packaging.\" Other franchises that have been honored with a Nerf collab include Star Wars, Halo, Star Trek, Aliens, and G.I. Joe, just to name a few.\nThis has seriously got to be one of the coolest gaming merchandise crossovers I think I've ever seen, and absolutely something I wish I had when I was a kid. I've only touched League of Legends once in my life (that's a whole story for another day), but the second Nerf releases something from a game I play, I might just have to splurge and treat my inner child.\nThe post Nerf released a replica of Jinx’s gun from League of Legends appeared first on Destructoid.",

Neon Giant currently only has one notable title to its name — cyberpunk RPG The Ascent — but is currently developing an as-yet-unannounced first-person-shooter, set in an open-world environment.\nFounded in the spring of 2018, Neon Giant was formatively made up of a party of former AAA game developers, featuring talent pulled from best-selling franchises such as DOOM, Gears of War, Far Cry, and Bulletstorm. Selected by Epic Games as one of several studios to receive a monetary grant for its first project, Neon Giant would develop and release The Ascent on PC and consoles in 2021, where it would receive moderate-to-high praise from critics and players.\nWith this latest acquisition, Neon Giant will join a number of western developers recently picked up by Krafton. Other purchases by the holding company include Subnautica studio Unknown Worlds and Striking Distance Studios, who are currently busy putting the finishing touches to their gory sci-fi horror The Callisto Protocol.\nThe Ascent is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post PUBG’s Krafton acquires The Ascent developer Neon Giant appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Labored with NINTENDO RULES (tm)\nNintendo has released a new demo for its madcap sports title Mario Strikers: Battle League, giving Switch owners the opportunity to check out the colorful and chaotic soccer game free of charge. The demo is available to download from the eShop now.\nNintendo had previously released a trial for Mario Strikers prior to the game's launch back in June of this year, but that particular demo was locked to Nintendo Online subscribers. While this new demo can be accessed by all Switch users, it is still limited to Nintendo's precious limitations. For starters, only one game of the Cup Battle feature can be played before the option is locked out. In addition, players can only experience the \"Quick Match\" feature seven times, before that too becomes inaccessible.\nhttps://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1590517271679508482?s=20&t=t-qXago3izz8rLojADoTSA\nIt's likely that Nintendo is hoping to get more footy fans on board, given the coming of the FIFA World Cup. But it's going to be a tough sell. While Mario Strikers: Battle League is a perfectly fine multiplayer title for anyone who wants a kickabout with pals, the full release has also been criticized for being very barebones, while also suffering from a distinct lack of major content drops/roster expansions since its initial launch. At $60, it's a hefty ask for a game that has been particularly subdued during its honeymoon period.\nStill, if you and some pals fancy a bit of goofy footballing fun, then perhaps this new demo might help to win you over. At least you'll come away without any astro-burns, nor will you have to suffer some Big Lad blowing an air horn in your ear.\nThe post New Mario Strikers: Battle League demo available on Switch appeared first on Destructoid.",

While the next-gen part points to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, CD Projekt Red also confirms it will also arrive for PC players. A physical version is also in the works for a later date.\nAs for what's in the update? CD Projekt will be showcasing that next week, in a special REDstreams over on their Twitch channel.

The project had been fairly quiet, as the spotlight had been mostly on other games like Cyberpunk 2077, which got its next-gen update earlier this year.\nAnd I can't lie, I've been waiting for this update too. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt was one of the better RPGs of the last generation, especially with its excellent pair of DLC stories. I was just holding out for an excuse to hop back in, and well, this is as good as any.\nIt's a good time for a Witcher refresher too, as the series has a lot on the horizon. While part of CD Projekt is working on Cyberpunk, another branch is developing the next trilogy in The Witcher series.

New stages are in store, some old and some new, as are new weapons. Three brand-new weapons (for Roller, Charger, and Shooter) are joined by 10 returning weapons from the Splatoon series.\nFor competitive players, the Chill Season of Splatoon 3 will see the return of X Battles.

Kishimoto notes that he envisions Sonic Frontiers becoming one of the series' most important titles, ultimately shaping the future of the long-running franchise.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuTcBAkyNL4\nLaunching November 8 on PC and consoles, Sonic Frontiers has, like most of The Blue Blur's games, been a divisive title, running the gauntlet of high and low scores from both critics and players. While many have praised the high-speed sequel's visuals and mechanical overhaul, the title has been criticized by some for its combat, \"boring\" environments, and bizarre juxtaposition of colorful, cartoonish characters with somber, monolithic enemies.\nRegardless, Sonic Frontiers has seen launch success. Over on the Steam platform, some 19,181 concurrent players were recorded at the game's launch, beating the previous series record — held by 2017's excellent throwback Sonic Mania. Whether Sonic Frontiers has the staying power to become the iconic release envisioned by Kishimoto remains to be seen, but this early admission that the title still has some way to go before developers will be pleased with the product does not go down smooth .\nSonic Frontiers is available now on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.\nThe post Sonic Frontiers director says team is examining feedback appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Oh Boy\nSony Santa Monica's long-anticipated release God of War Ragnarok finally hit shelves last week, and has already smashed all previous day-one sales in the long-running fantasy series — In fact, the first 24 hours of sales saw Ragnarok shift more copies than its 2018 predecessor achieved in its first week of release.\n\"God of War Ragnarok will debut at No.1 [in the UK Charts] and is the first cross-gen title in the series,\" said Gfk's Dorian Bloch in comments made to GamesIndustry.biz. \"Day 1 physical sales were already greater than any other full-week launch sales for other titles in this franchise.\" Bloch also notes that 55% of PS5 hardware sales this past week consisted of God of War Ragnarok bundles.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1wr0DfV73E\nLaunching on PS4 and PS5 on November 9, God of War Ragnarok sees a world-weary Kratos, accompanied by his fast-maturing son Atreus, embark upon another brutal odyssey across Scandinavia, preparing themselves for the coming of Ragnarok, the foretold event that will bring death to Gods and devastation to the land.\nWhile some critics and fans have criticized the new sequel for its length and some frustrating \"hand-holding\" NPC dialogue, Ragnarok has received mass praise across the board for its spectacular visuals, compelling characters, engaging combat, and operatic approach to storytelling. Clearly more than worth the wait, Kratos and Atreus' latest head-chopping jaunt is clearly in contention for many critics and players' Game of the Year award, and is already set to be one of 2022's best-selling releases.\nGod of War Ragnarok is available now on PlayStation platforms.\nThe post God of War Ragnarok day one sales break franchise records appeared first on Destructoid.",

May I start out by thanking everybody for their very, very kind birthday wishes last weekend. I had a pretty cool day, even if it was a little quieter than usual. I'm a busy fella, y'see? Still, I had a delicious donut and watched Sunset Boulevard for the 180th time, so it could have gone a whole lot worse. What really made it special, however, was the kindness shown to me here, in the Qposts, and on Twitter, so thank you.\nI hope that your November has gotten off to a rollicking start, and as the year starts wheezing to its conclusion, I hope that November offers up some great memories — gaming or otherwise — to carry you into the coming holiday season.

          "description": "All in the family\nSomething delightfully novel for this week's Arcade Archives entry as Hamster pulls '80s alien blaster Baraduke out of its big bag of Namco games and gives it a fresh release on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.\nOriginally released to the coin-op market in 1985, Baraduke, (aka Alien Sector), sees intrepid space explorer Toby \"Kissy\" Masuo picking her way through a series of claustrophobic interplanetary caverns, taking on an army of gooey aliens and gathering up cute, cycloptic creatures known as \"Paccets\". Once all of the stage's enemies are destroyed, our hero ventures down a large connecting pipe to confront one of a number of boss guardians, before heading on to the next zone.\nCheck out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Retro Hawk.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3zzKZkNdsc\nFascinatingly, despite its relative obscurity, Baraduke predates Nintendo's legendary release Metroid by a full year, though it contains several similarities to the classic NES title. Not only does Baraduke feature a labyrinth of alien-created caverns, linked by a series of metal tubes, but the Namco game also reveals its woman protagonist as a \"surprise\" at the game's climax, much like the coming of Metroid's Samus Aran.\nBaraduke would be followed up by little-known sequel Bakutotsu Kijūtei in 1988, before the franchise effectively ended. Hilariously, in deep Namco lore, it is said that Baraduke protagonist \"Kissy\" eventually married and divorced Dig Dug protagonist Taizo Hori, with one of the pairing's children being Susumu Hori of Mr. Driller fame! Someone call Kevin Fiege, I want to see a Namco Cinematic Universe!\nBaraduke is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nThe post Mr. Driller’s mom hits the Arcade Archives in Namco classic Baraduke appeared first on Destructoid.",

You can \"enter\" the contest with a deposit of 10 Platinum Points, with up to three entries (so 30 points in all). If you have points to spare, you may as well throw them into this: especially if they're expiring!\nHere are the prizes:\nA gaming rocker chair (you choose between Mario, Bowser, Peach, Yoshi, or Luigi)\nA 15 inch mega-plush Mushroom\nA 1-Up glow in the dark Switch wired controller\nA 1-Up glow in the dark Switch case\nWhile many contests tend to be first party games releasing at the time (like Kirby): this one smartly rolls with Nintendo's \"fab\" Mario squad.\nAs a reminder, if you want physical rewards, you can find our full Platinum Point guide here, which has been updated with details on weekly missions: bookmark it for when you need quick points for a reward. A handful of points is incredibly easy to get, as that’s basically just 15 minutes with Super Mario Run, or a quick sign-on to the 3DS or Wii U 3Shop. Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time.

          "description": "You had me at \"dark fairytale\"\nWith Stardew Valley being one of my most-beloved and most-played games of all time, I am constantly on the hunt for the next game that can scratch my farming/community simulator itch. There have been quite a few that I've written up over the past few months, and the newest title to add to the list of hopeful successors is the sandbox life sim RPG, Kynseed, which has been described as a \"Stardew Valley-inspired game with 'dark fairytale' creatures.\" Yeah, sign me up.\nThe game has been in early access since November 8, 2018, but it's finally getting its official release on December 6, 2022, as was announced in a newly-dropped release date trailer. Fans who have followed Kynseed all through its development are beyond thrilled to see the game nearing its completed state, as can be seen in the comments sections of its trailers.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU4rSiixt_Q\nThe release trailer showcases the usual fare for these kinds of games, like farming, cooking, and fishing, but things really get wild once they dive into the combat. Fighting off monsters looks a lot more intense than the slow-paced combat of Stardew, with more of a strategic, turn-based thing going on. I've really come to appreciate combat mechanics a lot since I had a big Stardew binge a few years ago, so I'll be interested to see how Kynseed's spin on things continues to evolve the simulator genre.\nOh, and did we mention that the developers behind Kynseed are industry veterans from the classic Fable series, now under the new banner of PixelCount Studios. Based on what we know of the game so far, it seems like they've injected this new project with all of the character and whimsy we can expect, so this is definitely one I'm looking forward to checking out on release day.\nThe post Kynseed is a Stardew-like with a “dark fairytale” theme coming this December appeared first on Destructoid.",

The new gameplay can be accessed once the player has completed the \"Bastille\" mission.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbfkLMOqw-o\nCagliostro's Secrets throws a little more heavy metal action in the divine Aegis' path.

In addition, the DLC drop adds five new weapons to our girl's arsenal of death, and includes several brand new side-quests that can be found and completed in Steelrising's other districts.\nWhile Steelrising was not quite the gemstone it might have been, I still found it a gorgeous-looking and very challenging adventure, that rose above its budgetary shortcomings thanks to its classy visuals and in-depth combat mechanics. While certainly not for everyone, the ambitious adventure is a sign that, as a developer, Spiders is growing with each successive release, and I hope that a future sequel could really deliver upon the game's compelling premise.\nSteelrising is available now on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X.\nThe post Delve into Cagliostro’s Secrets in new Steelrising DLC appeared first on Destructoid.",

Across each of the show's six episodes, we will journey with Miriam as she meets a party of noble and ignoble allies, confronting the tragedy of her past and forging a better future for herself, her people, and Tevinter itself.

          "description": "Just in time for Scarlet and Violet\nPokemon is coming up on its 30th anniversary in 2026, and it's been around for longer than some of you have been alive. I remember vividly when some parents at the time called it a fad: well, who's laughing now? The Pokemon Company, all the way to the bank.\nOf course, said company likes to take advantage of that nostalgia at any turn, and that includes a brand new interactive digital gallery of the series. You can find the gallery here. Once you're at the landing page, click or tap \"enter,\" and then the text in the white box after reading the terms of use (the text with the link icon will bring you here, to the terms of use page). Then select \"start\" at the bottom of the page.\nOnce you're in, you'll walk through an interactive game of sorts, where you can control a little avatar with a mouse click/tap or the arrow keys. While most of the text is in Japanese, you'll still be able to see dates for releases clearly: as well as installations like the giant Game Boy and the packaging for Pokemon Red and Green. Starters, legendaries, and key Pokemon are part of the exhibit too: and can be clicked on for further investigation (as well as items like the Pokeflute).\nIt's genius timing, as Scarlet and Violet are going to usher in a brand new generation in just a week.\nThe post This official online interactive Pokemon gallery is really cool appeared first on Destructoid.",

Since its launch in 2013, Revengence’s action and absurdity have garnered it a passionate internet fandom, but I have a little secret: I didn’t think the game was all that special when I played it at launch. However, years of being inundated with internet memes and being told my opinion is incorrect has inspired me to give Revengece another look. Will I acquire a new appreciation for the game nine years later? How many watermelons will I slice? You’ll have to tune in to find out. \n\n\n \nJoin me, Marcus Stewart, and Blake Hester as we revisit Raiden’s beloved solo adventure. If you enjoy our livestreams but haven’t subscribed to our Twitch channel, know that doing so not only gives you notifications and access to special emotes.

          "description": "Remedy Entertainment has announced a new deal with publisher 505 Games to co-develop and market Control 2. The news also provided insight into the sequel's development status. \nAccording to a press release, Control 2 (once known as Codename Heron) is currently in the concept phase, being built in Remedy’s proprietary Northlight engine. The game will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Remedy will publish the PC version while 505 will handle the game’s console releases. Control 2 has no release window, but Remedy did release a piece of concept art, posted below. \nThe press release also states that Control 2’s development budget initially sat at 50 million euros. Remedy and 505 will equally split marketing and development costs, as well as revenue generated by its release. Remedy retains full ownership of the Control IP, however. The press release also reveals that the first Control has sold over 3 million copies since launching in 2019. \n“We are excited to deepen our cooperation with Remedy and continue the success story of Control together,” say Rami and Raffi Galante, co-CEOs of Digital Bros Group/505 Games. “... Control is the biggest investment 505 Games has ever made, so it has a special place in our hearts. We are grateful to the whole player community that has made Control such a long-lasting and loved game, and are even more excited to bring out Control 2.”\nThis announcement was first teased last June, when Remedy and 505 revealed plans for new triple-A Control experiences. That same update revealed an upcoming multiplayer spin-off title known as Project Condor. Earlier this year, Remedy also struck a deal with Rockstar to develop remakes of Max Payne 1 and 2.",

          "description": "Dragon Age: Absolution is coming to Netflix on December 9. A new trailer provides a deeper look into the adult animated series' premise and new heroes. \nThe story centers on Miriam, an elven mercenary and former slave tasked with stealing a powerful and dangerous artifact. When the heist goes awry, the situation escalates into a larger fight for survival for Miriam and her friends. Set in Tevinter, the show features an original cast of heroes and, potentially, some old favorites (the characters at 0:45 look a lot like Cassandra and Leliana). Check out the trailer below. \n\n\nFirst announced during Netflix Geeked Week in June, Dragon Age: Absolution’s cast includes Kimberly Brooks (Miriam), Matthew Mercer (Fairbanks), Ashly Burch (Qwydion), Phil Lamarr (Roland), and Josh Keaton (Rezaren). The series consists of six 30-minute episodes. \nThough steeped in Dragon Age lore, it remains to be seen if the show has any connection to the upcoming Dragon Age: Dreadwolf. Absolution is far from the only video game adaptation Netflix has in the works. The CG-animated Sonic Prime also premieres in December. The streaming giant also announced a live-action Gears of War movie and its own animated series.",

The process started yesterday, and Google has posted an FAQ breaking down how it works. \nAs previously announced, Google is refunding all software purchases through the Stadia Store (such as games, DLC, in-game currency, and current pre-orders) and hardware purchases made through the Google Store; physical store purchases cannot be refunded. Eligible hardware includes:\nStadia Controller\nFounder's Edition\nPremiere Edition\nPlay and Watch with Google TV packages\nStadia Pro subscriptions will not be refunded, but members can play their Pro titles until the shutdown. However, those who purchased a subscription on or after September 29, 2022, and were charged for it will have that money returned. \nRefunds will be issued to the form of payment used to make the purchase. If that account is no longer available, Google will send an email with instructions for setting up an alternative method of receiving the refund.\nUsers may have already received an email notifying them of their refund status. Although payments are now being issued, that doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll get yours today or this week. This will be a gradual rollout that will continue up until January 18. There's no way of knowing when you'll receive your refund, so eligible users should keep an eye on their inbox and bank account over the coming days or weeks.",

As I eat my sandwich, I make conversation with Street Fighter 6 director Takayuki Nakayama, who is seated next to me, enjoying his own sandwich. After touching on topics of our respective histories with Street Fighter and other games we've been playing, he asks if I've enjoyed what I've played of Street Fighter 6 to this point.\nI let him know the gameplay and art style are terrific and that I feel the Real-Time Commentary feature is a revolutionary addition to the fighting genre.

Everyone (Capcom included) has seen your memes about Ken's rougher appearance in this game, but we traveled to the studio in Osaka, Japan, to learn more about what's happening with one of the franchise's most iconic characters.\nWhile there, we went hands-on with the game, had extensive conversations with the developers, chatted about the lessons the team took from Street Fighter V's disappointing launch, and even learned about a new way to play Street Fig…",

The studio has been quite open with its accessibility desires, detailing more than 60 in a blog post earlier this year. Now, with the game out on November 9, the studio has released an even more detailed post breaking down exactly what to expect. \n\n\nSanta Monica Studio says there are more than 70 features in Ragnarok that \"enable players to customize the gameplay experience to suit their needs\" and the list is a sight to behold.

Presets include one for vision accessibility, hearing accessibility, motion reduction, apply motor accessibility, and a changed setting indicator as well. \nThere are alternative control schemes, remappable buttons, hold and press options, in-game assistance settings, and so much more.

As for why, she says the working dynamic with the game's audio director has become difficult and she sees no path forward. Variety reports that the audio director in question is Stephen Miller but Schachner doesn't name this person in her announcement. \nNews of her departure comes from a statement released by Schachner on Twitter on November 3, as reported by Video Games Chronicle. Schachner's departure comes after years of work with Modern Warfare II studio Infinity Ward on games like 2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and 2016's Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. Other credits include Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Anthem, as noted by VGC. \n\"I am sad to say I can no longer continue to compose music for MWII/Warzone,\" her statement reads. \"Over the past couple of months, the working dynamic with the audio director has become increasingly challenging and I don't see any path forward. As of now, I am unsure of the status and release plan for the soundtrack as it's been taken out of my hands. While I don't have any control over how the music is presented in-game, what will be released on the soundtrack is not my artistic intent in regards to mixing and mastering.\" \nShe then thanks fans for their support and gives some shout outs to others involved with the game's score, including mixer Frank Wolf, \"creative vision\" Mike Dean, and performing artists including Baseck, Brain Mantia, and M.B.

This introduces a new combat mode where the team must fight their way up Madame Bwahstrella’s multi-story tower to rescue Spawny, the visor-rocking Rabbid from Kingdom Battle. What’s important to note is that Tower of Doooom will be exclusive to the season pass, meaning you’ll be unable to purchase it separately. \nThe second untitled DLC arrives in mid-2023. So far, we only know it takes players to a new planet, features never-before-seen enemies, allies, and secrets, and stars a new antagonist. Finally, Rayman crashes the party in the final expansion to close out the year. Ubisoft’s limbless hero joins Rabbid Peach and Rabbid Mario on a separate adventure in a new location. Unlike Tower of Doooom, the second and third expansions can be purchased a la carte. \nI enjoyed Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope quite a bit, awarding it a 9 out of 10. In my review, which you can read here, I wrote that the game “builds upon Kingdom Battle’s foundation with smart tweaks and fun additions to emerge as a better game in every way.”",

Not long after the reveal, speculation that Abandoned was actually a Silent Hill game secretly in development began to ramp up, but studio head Hasan Kahraman took to Twitter to shut down those rumors.\nFrom there, the speculation train arrived at the idea that famed Metal Gear Solid developer Kojima was attached to the game.

Some staff will be transferred to Eidos Montreal, another studio owned by Embracer. This news comes just a few weeks after Onoma underwent a rebranding process where it adopted the new name.\nOnoma was best known for its work on the Go series, turn-based spin-offs of popular Eidos Interactive titles designed for mobile. This includes Hitman Go, Lara Croft Go, and Deus Ex Go. Their most recent work was Tomb Raider Reloaded, which came to mobile devices earlier this year, and their future plans involved a title based on Avatar: The Last Airbender.\nEarlier this year, Onoma was just one part of a much larger series of Embracer’s acquisitions, which included Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal. In August, Embracer proceeded to acquire Limited Run Games, Tripwire Interactive, Tuxedo Labs, the IP rights to The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, and several more studios.\nThe Bloomberg report also says that the closure is part of a cost-cutting initiative, and that Eidos Montreal will have projects scaled back and cut as well. Some of these resources will be redirected to assist in the development of a game in the Fable franchise, led by Playground Games.\n[Source: Bloomberg]\nWere you a fan of the Go series?
