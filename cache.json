Despite Konami's rather lacklustre attempt to revitalise the franchise with Contra: Rogue Corps in 2019, we here at Nintendo Life still have a spot in our hearts for the run 'n' gun shooter series.\nStarting with the original Contra back in 1986 as a coin-op arcade title, the franchise has since gone on to spawn a sizeable handful of sequels on Nintendo platforms. Since many of these are known by different names in Europe, it can often be a bit tricky to know exactly where to start (although Konami's own Contra Anniversary Collection for the Switch goes a long way to rectifying this).\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Seeing your fellow players in force-ghost hologram form is all well and good for the first few seconds, but what do you do when you are 100 seconds in? What about 200? What abou— well, you get the picture.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Introduced in 2015 and used on Wii U and 3DS titles, every time we saw this little gold logo, we were always a bit excited to see those first-party titles at a reduced price. Sadly, this hasn't made a return on the Switch or the eShop, but Nintendo seems to be reusing some of those assets in a bit of a cheeky manner.\nGood friend of Nintendo Life Jon Cartwright spotted the 'Team Picks' range over on the Switch's eShop earlier today and rightly pointed out that the branding looks pretty darn familiar.

Fear not, the studio's flair for an intriguing setup remains with its latest release inspired heavily by Russian folklore, leaving the question of whether or not Little Orpheus is any fun to play.\nLittle Orpheus begins with protagonist Ivan Ivanovich Privalov being interrogated by a man known as the General. You see, Ivan is a bumbling Soviet Cosmonaut who – having failed his exams and his physical – is sent on a massive drill to the centre of the Earth rather than the stars. Ivan went missing for three years, and now the General wants to know the whereabouts of the titular atomic bomb that helped power the drill. Ivan weaves an incredible story to stave off his execution at the hands of his increasingly irate interrogator.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Led by legendary RPG writer and director Tetsuya Takahashi, the studio is renowned for the monolithic (pun intended) Xenoblade series. Combining MMORPG-style, memorable worlds, stunning music, and philosophical writing, the Xenoblade Chronicles franchise has taken the world by storm. Monolith Soft's history, however, is as monolithic as its now-flagship series.\nTakahashi is perhaps most famous for co-writing and directing the seminal PS1 RPG Xenogears, which he created during his time at Squaresoft. But in the years following Xenogears' 1998 release, Square decided to focus all of its energy on the Final Fantasy series. Xenogears underperformed in the eyes of the company, but Takahashi had big plans for his proposed franchise, of which Xenogears was meant to be 'Episode 5'.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Gloomwood is, so far, a very good game, but it is also not much of a game - in the literal sense that it has launched into early access incomplete. There's currently just enough of it to play that it makes you feel both bereft and quite annoyed when it suddenly clangs its great iron doors shut in front of you. \"Let me in!!\" you scream, as you hammer on the silent portal. \"I really like Thief! I get you! I want to throw more decapitated heads as lures!\"\nIf you are one of those people who bases their gaming personality on liking the original Thief series, Gloomwood will have been on your radar for a while. It's a grimy, steampunk-ish stealth immersive sim with a deliberate low-poly vibe, and it picks up the abandoned Thief football to absolutely run with it. But, though the current EA build is but short, it feels like Gloomwood is aiming to punt that ball into outer space. There's so much more room to be playful and experiment than I expected, and it's so much fun that if you'd never played a stealth sim in your life I'd recommend Gloomwood. Except I wouldn't, because it feels like I'd be doing you a disservice to recommend it now, when the fun will be so quickly snatched away.\nRead more",

I suspect it's probably a similar experience to watching the carnage of Chivalry II play out from the safety of a nearby bench. The newly announced Warlander from Nier Replicant devs Toylogic certainly has the medieval setting in common with Torn Banner Studio's first-person hack and slash, but this free-to-play multiplayer warfare game is an altogether different beast. You control your warriors in third-person, for starters, and its more cartoonish visuals allow for, well, daft cataclysmic events like a flaming meteor shower to hone in on a player's position without appearing completely over the top. As it prepares to enter its first open beta later today, September 12th, I went hands on with a brief demo build to see what it was all about. \nRead more",

It's often uttered by your knuckle-dusting healer Sally, and is invariably followed up by, \"You havin' a laugh, mate?\" and \"Facking hell!\" - partly because Sally is from Laaaandan and is thus obligated to speak lik' tha', innit (because how else would you know this is a game set in Laaaandan), but also because the thugs, security guards and cybernetic dogs she's often fighting in this seedy tale of corporate dystopia are some of the most frustrating enemies known to video games. The type who are seemingly resistant to every single weapon type in your arsenal, or who invariably have big, scripted healing sequences just when you're about to nail 'em. \nIt's a phrase I often found myself echoing while playing Sunday Gold for review, too, both during its tedious, war of attrition-style turn-based battles, and while trying to figure out some of its more obtuse puzzles. BKOM Studios have tried to fuse one too many things together in Sunday Gold, and the result is a messy, somewhat artificial blend of Deathloop's style, Invisible Inc's tension and a more action-led focus on the cerebral role-playing of Disco Elysium. There's still much to admire in its stylish visuals and atmospheric music, but I also haven't been this cross playing a video game since Felix The Reaper, and that's saying something. \nRead more",

As Alice Bee noted earlier in the week, there are just too many cool, interesting games coming out for us to review effectively on the site at the moment (although rest assured, we will do our darnedest to cover as many of them as we can).\nPart of the challenge is working out what's worth reviewing, and what we think is worth highlighting for you, our readers. The other part, though, is often entirely selfish on our part, just playing and writing about cool games we like. In fact, the decision to review many of the games we covered this week - Railbound, Jack Move and Roadwarden - were all down to having played and liked some form of demo, making events like the Steam Next Fest an increasingly invaluable tool in helping us cut through the noise when we inevitably enter mega months like September. \nRead more",

Thriller writers deal in short, snappy chapters, and the fat chapter is the one that ends up getting a load of events or exposition shoved into it, somewhere in the second half, because they wouldn't fit anywhere else. Every year in games there's a fat month, where loads of games come out and loads of them look really good and there is never enough time godammit.\nThis year that month is September. There are so many games out this month that look so much my jam that I want to spread 'em on my morning toast, but September is also the month that a lot of RPS staff have holiday booked - including me, for two weeks, which means that if these games do get reviewed it probably won't be by me.

In the game, it's the year everything went dark in this turn-based Japanese-style RPG, with a solar storm biffing the world's electronics. It threw the world into chaos, giving rise to the megacorps that now control the dystopian cyberpunk society where our heroine Noa is trying to make a living. In the real world, of course, 1997 was the year Final Fantasy VII came out, the seminal JRPG that Jack Move owes a great deal to (right down to its menu plink plink sound). Developers So Romantic have said outright that it's been one of the main inspirations for Jack Move, and its shady corporate powers and grungy urban landscape certainly feel of a piece with ShinRa's grip on the city of Midgar. \nBut the bigwigs at MonoMind aren't out to poison the world and suck the life from it in Jack Move. Instead, they're more concerned with using their newfound technological powers to find eternal life – a classic 'upload your mind to the metaverse' kind of tale you'll probably recognise if you've read any of the cyberpunk 101 novels such as William Gibson's Neuromancer or Permutation City by Greg Egan. Jack Move's story doesn't tread any new ground in this respect, but Noa and her hacker pal Ryder are a fiery spirited pair that make this six-hour tale of espionage and rebellion against its cartoonish villain well worth dipping into. Yes, you read that correctly. A JRPG you can polish off in a single day of play. Bliss.\nRead more",

Sure, I saw the main sights and had a great time soaking in the ambiance, but I know that I missed so many hidden gems. I want to go back and explore, maybe this time with a local guide who knows its secrets.\nAt its most basic, Roadwarden is a text-based RPG. You play as the titular roadwarden, who sets out from the city to investigate an unmapped peninsula with little more than their horse for company. Your goal as set by the people who sent you is to investigate the region and report your findings in preparation for the expansion of trade guilds in the area. But you can also set your own goal, shaping your character’s approach from the start in a way that helps with roleplaying a particular kind of adventurer throughout. And once you get to that adventuring, dozens of sidequests open up covering everything from gathering fruit to curing the plague.\nRead more",

They'd escaped the clutches of the French Inquisition and the hordes of plague rats following in their wake, and the pair were hopeful about finding a cure for the cursed macula flowing through Hugo's veins.\nAlas, when I pick up their journey in chapter six of Asobo's upcoming sequel, A Plague Tale: Requiem, Amicia is having a particularly terrible time of it. Not only is she suffering from an open head wound, leaving her unsteady on her feet, but rumours are flying in the nearby pilgrim camp about something bad having gone down in the last city they passed through. Exactly what is hard to say with five chapters' worth of context missing from my preview build, but the pack of guards who are hot on the siblings' trail quickly make it plain: several men died back in that city, and they're pointing the finger squarely at Amicia's knife, slingshot and crossbow. \nRead more",

          "description": "Third person skater shooter Rollerdrome has some really cool weapons, but what is it that makes them so special? I mean, there’s only four of them, and you’re forced to constantly perform tricks to regain ammo, which doesn't make them easy to use. I think it’s because of their more literal significance in the game. Rollerdrome threatens you with multiple enemy types called Houseplayers, all formidable, especially in the heat of battle when they combine their efforts. Luckily, the four distinct weapons you’re equipped with act as an equaliser; each weapon is a solution for a particular enemy. Developers Roll7 could have easily added a bunch of copied and pasted guns from every generic shooter, but instead they were more intentional about the weapons they included, with each weapon complimenting the gunplay and the game as a whole.\r\n\n \nRead more",

You're Aegis, a feminine robot created to entertain and protect Queen Marie Antoinette. Marie, safe outside Paris but somewhat peeved at her husband's new penchant for extreme mass murder, sends you on a Soulslike mission to sort it all out.\nThis takes some doing, but luckily Aegis is a very advanced robot, the bestest of all the robots. Slight but adaptive with it, and even having an advanced AI, Aegis can carve a swift path through the more than usually twisted metal in her way. It's a bit too easy, in fact.\nRead more",

I don’t think I’ve ever built one on the back of a giant animal after the apocalypse, though. Indie sci-fi citybuilder The Wandering Village will let me do that when it enters early access on Steam on September 14th.

I got a sneaky early peek at Lucid behind closed doors at PAX East earlier this year, and let me tell you, its gorgeous pixel art and emphasis on air dashing through crystalline barriers with a honking great axe looks rad as hell.

Nine times out of ten, it's a sign that something's gone wrong further up the line - that someone, somewhere, has sent out a train with half its usual number of carriages, and is therefore destined to ruin everyone's day in the process by cramming us all in like a pack of sardines. \nIn Afterburn's adorable train puzzler Railbound, however, two carriages are a cause for celebration. In a game that's about guiding numbered compartments onto the back of an engine (using a limited number of track tiles to get them there in the right order), two-carriage puzzles offer the perfect amount of cerebral head-scratching. They've got a bit more bite than simply guiding a single carriage to its destination, but they're not so complicated that they'll repeatedly make you reach for the hint button to help you fill in the gaps. Railbound has a tendency to be a bit too abstract in its later stages, but more on that in a sec. All you need to know right now is that there are plenty of smart ideas to wrap your head around here, and that you'll be grinning from ear to ear by the time you reach the end of the line. \nRead more",

Ellen McLain (the TF2 announcer), Gary Schwartz (Heavy and Demoman), John Patrick Lowrie (Sniper) and Robin Atkin Downes (Medic) answered all our questions including how they each created the voices for the characters and if they would they return for a completely metaphorical release of Team Fortress 3 which - spoilers - was a resounding yes. Watch below for the entire interview.\nRead more",

We are big fans of Monkey Island here at RPS, so after watching him guest speak on the Adventure Games PAX panel today, we got a chance to chinwag with Gilbert and to chat about his upcoming comeback to the series with Return to Monkey Island.\nGilbert was lovely enough to tell us all about the next game in the Monkey Island saga -  what it was like to return to Monkey Island's world after so long, what we can expect from the puzzles, and snippets of the game's story. Watch below to see the interview in its entirety and make sure you watch to the end to see my impression of a pirate - you won't wanna miss that.\nRead more",

          "description": "It's day two of PAX West and to kick off our second day of game events and demos we got hands-on with a build of Neowiz's Pinocchio RPG, Lies of P. The gameplay demo caused quite a stir when it was at Gamescom earlier this year, so we made it one of our priorities to check it out here in Seattle.\nNeowiz are not actually at PAX so there wasn't anyone on the team to give us some behind-the-scenes info, but I got stuck into the demo for a solid 30 minutes, brawling with the game's angry robot lads that roamed the city's blood-washed cobbled streets.\nOverall, I had a great time with the demo. Yes, it is incredibly similar to Bloodborne in both its combat and environments but there are plenty of other elements that steer it away from FromSoftware's horror-filled gothic RPG. If you want more details instead of that short summary then check out our video below where I talk about my time with the build, and about having my arse kicked by giant mechanical automatons. Enjoy!\nRead more",

Now that deal is back, once again via the Laptop Outlet store on Ebay. \nThis time though, you'll  need to use code FANCY15 to knock 15% off the price of the BoostStation, bringing it down to that alluring £93 price point once again. \nRead more",

A new State of Play is set to air tomorrow, September 13, with updates on all things PlayStation.\nAnnounced just 24 hours ahead of its air time, the Sony State of Play will go live at 6 p.m. ET / 3 p.m. PT on Sony's Twitch and YouTube channels.\nIn its announcement, Sony notes that the Tokyo Game Show is just around the corner. For the State of Play, Sony says to expect some updates from its Japanese partners, along with a \"few other surprises\" from developers around the world.\nThe show is expected to come in at about 20 minutes of reveals, new updates, and gameplay for 10 games. Platform-wise, Sony identifies the PlayStation 5, PS4, and PlayStation VR 2.\nhttps://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1569445831614369793\nThe week to come in showcase streams\nThis puts Sony at the opposite end of tomorrow's news cycle from Nintendo, which is hosting its September Nintendo Direct at 7 a.m. PT / 10 a.m. ET.\nIn the week ahead, several more publishers and developers are planning streams for the Tokyo Game Show 2022. Square Enix, Capcom, Konami, Bandai Namco, and more will all host streams throughout the week.\nAs for what Sony still has to show, there are several games in its own studio pipeline. God of War Ragnarok is currently aiming for its launch in November, while other projects like Insomniac's Marvel games are further down the line.\nJapanese partners could cover a broad swath as well. Square Enix has made several State of Play appearances, as has Capcom. With just about 20 minutes set for this Sony State of Play, across 10, it will probably be a pretty fast and to-the-point show.\nWe'll see what Sony has in store for its September State of Play tomorrow, at 6:00 p.m. ET.\nThe post Surprise, Sony State of Play returns on September 13 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A space adventure for day traders\nMass Effect is one of those series that we've played so many times, sometimes it can be fun to load up a mod for the sake of switching things up a bit. You could always go for the expanded armory or expanded galaxy, or even try the Take Back Earth mod if you really want to make it interesting. Of course, I'm sure there are some crypto bros out there who are also Mass Effect fans, or at the very least, some people who want to try to game a stock market in a low-stakes environment. Or maybe they just hate the probing mini-game. Who's to say?\nEither way, this Mass Effect Legendary Edition mod might be for you. It's called Nos Astra Mineral Exchange (created by beccatoria and Team Pyjak), and adds a whole galactic stock market to Mass Effect 2, which allows players to trade money and resources. (Thanks, PC Gamer.) Basically, you can either trade minerals and mine them, or just forgo the probing altogether.\n\nThere are also new missions attached to the mod as well, which include new voice lines for existing characters with AI dialogue tool xVASynth thanks to the work of modder Gaige Barker.\nTo gain access to the newly available stock market, players will first need to head to the Crescent Nebula, then to the Asari world of Illium, then to the capital city of Nos Astra, and then finally to the docks entrance where public trading terminals can be found. There's also a terminal on the Shadow Broker's ship, if that's more convenient.\nThe mod's site even details the Mass Effect 2 stock market's exchange rate, which is the kind of thing I don't really get, but go nuts if you're into that sort of thing. Nos Astra Mineral Exchange is available to download on NexusMods or Mod DB — just make sure you have the ME3 Tweaks Mod Manager ready to go first.\nThe post This Mass Effect 2 mod adds a mineral stock market in place of probing planets appeared first on Destructoid.",

As reported by Gematsu, Psychic 5 Eternal is currently in development for Nintendo Switch and will be playable during this week's Tokyo Game Show festivities.\nOriginally developed by NMK and released to Japanese arcades in 1987, Psychic 5 sees a party of cute anime characters navigate a maze filled with hazards and perils, en route to a showdown with the nefarious Demon King. While all five characters have their own playstyle, gameplay places heavy emphasis on the smart control of incredibly \"floaty\" jumps, which require the player to glide their chosen hero around the various traps and obstacles that stand in their way.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZEVd5Q2sQk&t\nThe odd little adventure would not receive a home port and was rarely seen outside its native Japan, but has garnered a devoted fanbase in modern times, with fans attracted to its tricky gameplay and fun aesthetic. Psychic 5 Eternal — developed by CRT Games — will sport improved visuals, a new widescreen option, co-op two-player action, and a fully rescored soundtrack, handled by the original composer, Shinichi Sakamoto. Players will be able to switch between the remastered and original versions of the game on a whim.\nPsychic 5 Eternal is currently in development for Nintendo Switch.

Should your warranty have expired, then the team will contact you to discuss any issues found with the device and come to an agreement on what is to be done to get the powerful piece of kit fully operational and back in your hands once again. Of course, some problems will not be covered by the free repair scheme.\n\"If your dog gnaws on your thumbstick and breaks it, this is not covered by warranty,\" offers Valve as an example. \"Previously your only option was DIY repair, but now you'll now be able to contact support, who will supply instructions to ship your Steam Deck to one of our repair centers. Our team will take a look and offer to replace and calibrate your thumbstick for a fee.\"\nSo better keep ol' Fido away from your purchase.\nThe Steam Deck, essentially a powerful handheld PC, launched earlier this year and has since been rolling out units to its pre-order customers.

Mia — marvelously portrayed in the movie by Jane Levy — is a fearsome Deadite slayer when up close and personal, and sports a trait that sees her damage actually increases as her fear level rises. Mia can also unleash her own Deadite nature, as one of the few humans ever to survive Deadite possession. Check her out in the trailer below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4wR_u6-Q2E\nAs a Support class character, David provides a central beacon of unwavering strength and hope for his teammates. David is equipped with healing abilities — for both himself and his brethren — and is also able to severely reduce the fear of characters in his vicinity. Much like in the brutal movie, David is equipped with a violent nail gun, as well as, somewhat more hilariously, dual-wielding syringes. These new weapons are also readily available for use by other Survivors.\nIn addition to the two new characters, the DLC bundle includes a new single-player mission, \"Weekend at Knowby's,\" which is loosely based on the events of the movie. This mission features a variant of the Knowby Cabin, complete with the terrifying blood storm that concludes the film. A brand new screamer, (which remains an obnoxious and weirdly cheap-looking element of the game), is also included in the new bundle.\nEvil Dead: The Game is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox. A Switch port is reportedly in development, though, admittedly, news has been particularly quiet on that front for some time now.\nThe post Mia and David Allen are here to nail the Deadites in Evil Dead: The Game appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "(Mostly based on characters who don't wear shoes)\nIconic sportswear retailer Reebok is teaming with Capcom to produce a brand new range of footwear based upon the latter's legendary fighting franchise, Street Fighter. The new Reebox x Capcom collection was revealed by Reebok Taiwan, and unfortunately may be exclusive to that territory.\nThe new range of sneakers is styled after some of the franchise's most legendary World Warriors, including Ryu, Chun-Li, Dhalsim, M. Bison, and dopey edgelord Akuma. As far as licensed sneakers go, they're actually pretty slick, with the super clean Ryu and Chun kicks looking crisp, while the brown and gold Dhalsim edition also shines. You can check out some of the new footwear in the images below, courtesy of Twitter user Petefighter.\nhttps://twitter.com/PeteFighter/status/1568245638739132422?s=20&t=BrSKVsqxXnSL2FBeNP5Lyw\nIn addition to the sneaker range, Reebok will also be offering up some basic apparel, including T-shirts, a pair of flip-flops, (or \"slides\" as y'all call them), and some casual track pants. Again, it seems that this entire range might be exclusive to Taiwan, so die-hard sneaker collectors will, unfortunately, have to go the import route if they wish to get their hands... erm... feets, on the cool-looking shoes.\nThis Reebok line is, of course, not the first time that Street Fighter and shoewear have collaborated. Previously, Capcom has teamed with Vans, Nike, Onitsuka Tiger, Converse, and many other apparel retailers to produce shoes and clothing based on its stellar series. Given the enduring nature of the franchise and its legendary characters, it seems to be a partnership set to run and run.\nThe post Reebok and Capcom team up for new range of Street Fighter sneakers appeared first on Destructoid.",

Every so often we get a glimpse of what games they actually help work on, like the Zelda series. As spotted by Nintendo Life, it seems like Monolith Soft added a new game to their repertoire on their company game list: Splatoon 3.\nAs the lengthy list points out, Monolith Soft has been assisting on many first-party Nintendo games, including prior entries in the Splatoon series. This is not unlike the relationship that a lot of other studios have with larger publishers, like High Moon Studios and Vicarious Visions assisting Activision with franchises like Destiny. This particular info drop that they worked on Splatoon 3 is fascinating though, given that it and the massive undertaking that is Xenoblade Chronicles 3 were released at basically the same time.\nWhile the company started in 1999, it was taken over by Nintendo in 2007, and has been a staple studio at the publisher ever since. They've grown year after year, going from 150 employees in 2017 to roughly double that recently. As I've said numerous times, I hope they continue their run indefinitely. They're an asset to Nintendo and aren't celebrated enough.\nThe post Monolith Soft worked on Splatoon 3, which highlights how essential they are to Nintendo appeared first on Destructoid.",

Siege is renowned for its exceedingly tense gameplay and reliance on strategy, teamwork, and lightning-fast reactions, which developer Ubisoft hopes will be reflected even on the smallest of screens.\nAnyone willing to jump in on the action can sign up over at Google Play, in hopes of being invited to the party. It should be reiterated that the beta is currently on Android devices only, though an iOS equivalent is expected in the near future. The Rainbow Six Mobile beta is currently accepting players from the United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, India, Singapore, and the Philippines.

It'll be viewable here, and since a lot of people are keen on details, here's the full rundown we got from Nintendo:\n\"Tune in at 7 a.m. PT on Tuesday, Sept. 13, for a Nintendo Direct livestream featuring roughly 40 minutes of information mainly focused on Nintendo Switch games launching this winter.\"\n\nBreaking the obvious down, this is a fully-fledged 40-minute non-indie Direct, which will likely focus on first-party games as well as \"partner studios.\" Also, it's \"mainly focused on winter games,\" so the bulk will probably not feature titles slated for 2023 and beyond. Maybe we'll get a final tease/stinger at the end for something like Metroid Prime 4.\nThey picked the right time to schedule it, as we're heading into the fall/winter season, and Nintendo needs to start hyping that up. Also, it's TGS week! So folks are already tuning into various streams and the like, and are ready for it.\nWhat we could see in this Nintendo Direct\nAs for what's launching the rest of the year, we have Bayonetta 3, as well as Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. It's possible that Advance Wars could get some sort of update as well, even a new window, if not a surprise launch.\nThen there's Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2 and Metroid Prime 4, which aren't of a \"mainly focused on games launching this winter\" sort; but are still things people have wanted updates on. A smaller-scale surprise eShop drop could be in the cards too, similar to HAL Laboratory's instant-release projects.\nA Mario movie update is a distinct possibility as well.\nWhere to watch the 2022 September Nintendo Direct\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ9Iz7HhU-I\nFor the UK stream, Nintendo UK has provided the following statement:\n\"As a mark of respect during this period of national mourning, we will not livestream tomorrow’s Nintendo Direct. It will be published as a video-on-demand on our YouTube channel at 16:00 (UK time) tomorrow.\"\n\nThe post A Nintendo Direct is happening on September 13, 2022 appeared first on Destructoid.",

As of now, they're also available on the official My Nintendo Store (again, as a two-pack).\nThe figures themselves are true to the Minecraft series, but are less detailed (by design) compared to some of the more premium figures that have been released recently: like the carefully-crafted Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak line.\nIf you need to check with your retailer, here are the details for the two-pack:\nSKU - 115856\nUPC - 00045496893910\nSo what's next for amiibo in 2022 and beyond?\nAfter Steve and Alex, we have the Splatoon 3 amiibo trio confirmed for \"holiday\" of this year, with three figures in tow:\nOctoling (Blue)\nInkling (Yellow)\nSmallfry\nBeyond that, Sephiroth is next up for the Smash wave, followed by Pyra/Mythra, then Kazuya, then (presumably) Sora. Once Sora potentially hits, the Smash Ultimate line will be fully complete, ending a journey that began in November of 2014.\nOf course, it's going to take a while for that to happen: at least until 2023, given the timeline between announcements and release for these figures.

          "description": "The Defenders of The Night return\nMixed among the frankly suffocating wave of headlines rolling out of Disney this weekend was the curious, but not unwelcome news that The House of Mouse is to release a remaster of its 16-bit release Gargoyles, an action-platformer based upon the cult animated series of the same name.\nReleased in 1995 for the Sega Genesis, (the SNES version was canceled), Gargoyles was part of Disney's major push into 16-bit gaming, which would see it adapt franchises such as Aladdin, The Lion King, The Jungle Book, and even Pinocchio (which nobody remembers) for home consoles. Gargoyles was one of the few 16-bit games that licensed a Disney TV show rather than a classic movie, albeit one with a very passionate fanbase.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF7KQjKC-1c\nGargoyles, which first aired in the fall of 1994, told the story of an ancient Scottish clan, cursed to live as stone creatures for all eternity until they are accidentally awoken after their castle is transported to modern-day New York. Now, under the shadows of the night, the Gargoyles protect the people of the city from crime, lawlessness, and corrupt capitalist David Xanatos. The show, much like Batman: The Animated Series, was praised for its melodramatic flair, darker tone, and character relations.\nDetails pertaining to the Gargoyles remaster are incredibly thin on the ground, but the title is expected to launch on PC and \"modern consoles\" at some point in the future. It was not made clear how far along the project is at this moment in time, so it looks like Gargoyles fans will simply have to return to their perch and wait for the coming of the moon.\nThe post Gargoyles remaster will see the 16-bit hit return for modern platforms appeared first on Destructoid.",

In Japan alone, the Switch shooter has already shifted a staggering 3.45 million copies in its first three days of release, breaking previous Switch release records in the country. The news was broken in a weekend press statement by the publisher.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ODI00fgeS0\nLaunching on September 9, Splatoon 3 sees the return of madcap, team-based, multiplayer gameplay, as squid kids and octolings battle to out to capture territory across various modes and maps. Splatoon 3 features all of the paint-sloshing action that is the franchise's trademark, set against a slightly more dystopian landscape — the aftermath of Splatoon 2's final Splatfest favoring \"Chaos\" over \"Order.\"\nBut, despite the series' general popularity, I'm not sure that anybody was expecting the new sequel to be a record-breaker, having already become the fastest-selling Nintendo Switch title in its native Japan. It should also be noted that these figures do not include sales from Europe and North America, which will no doubt add to the incredible number and see Splatoon 3 nestle comfortably in place as one of 2022's best-selling releases.\nSplatoon 3 is available now on Nintendo Switch.

          "description": "The Assassin's Creed franchise is getting its hub\nToday, Ubisoft laid out the road ahead for the Assassin's Creed franchise. While it looks to a trip way back to Basim in Mirage, several other adventures are on the horizon, including a long-awaited jaunt to Feudal Japan.\nDuring the Assassin's Creed showcase portion of today's Ubisoft Forward, the publisher confirmed its plans for Assassin's Creed Infinity. This AC Infinity will act as a hub of sorts for Assassin's Creed moving into the future, tying together all the different experiences and locales of Assassin's Creed.\nSeveral studios are working on projects for it right now. And as reported earlier this week, one of them is Ubisoft Quebec, which is working on something fans have likely been waiting some time for: an Assassin's Creed spotlighting shinobi. Codename Red will see Assassin's Creed head to Feudal Japan, playing a shinobi character.\nAlso in the works is Codename Hexe, a project from Ubisoft Montreal with Watch Dogs: Legion creative director Clint Hocking on board. No more info was given on the stream, but reports have indicated this will head to the witch trials of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nAn Infinity ahead\nAll of this is part of Ubisoft's plans for the Assassin's Creed Infinity hub, which may have even more in store. Alongside the two codename projects, Ubisoft's Marc-Alexis Côté confirmed that the publisher is looking into ways to incorporate standalone multiplayer into Assassin's Creed again.\nWith a mobile project, Netflix partnership, and more in store, seems like a lot of Assassin's Creed is in store for the coming years.\nThe post Ubisoft teases its plans for Assassin’s Creed Infinity, including Feudal Japan appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It's \"the last chapter\"\nMore Assassin's Creed Valhalla DLC is in the cards beyond what we've already gotten, and it's appropriately called \"The Last Chapter;\" a free questline that \"ties up the game.\"\nIn the brief trailer (which is more of a teaser, starting around 16:45 in the below showcase), Eivor notes that she's \"done all that she can for her people,\" and says that it's \"time to say goodbye, and set sail for distant shores and new adventures.\" And apparently she'll do just that in the DLC! The good news is that this DLC is free, and is being treated as a customary questline add-on. Eivor will \"reunite with some key characters, including some influential historical ones.\"\nIf you haven't been following along, Assassin's Creed Valhalla was released in late 2020, and it's still trucking through the end of 2022. It hosted expansions titled Wrath of the Druids and The Siege of Paris, on top of the aforementioned free updates and quality of life upgrades. Like most Assassin's Creed games once the DLC stops flowing, it'll make for a pretty packed \"GOTY/Complete\" experience once everything is factored in. Ideally this \"Last Chapter\" actually ties up some loose ends and adds to the connective tissue of the series.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS_khJE0mbQ&list=PLBnrd5k2F2INdjLweJqlvK0OCRIJPg_O2&index=33\nThe post Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is getting a DLC that ties up the main story appeared first on Destructoid.",

According to Ubisoft, it'll sport \"all the iconic Assassin's Creed gameplay, with mobile controls.\" The exact date given for the timeline is 215 BCE, and in the teaser we see an aerial view of the new open world playground: and a closeup of the upcoming protagonist. However, said protagonist is actually \"fully customizable.\"\nAll we have to go on right now, beyond the short teaser, is that it's called \"Codename Jade.\" This was one of three codenames given out for future entries, which will deal with feudal Japan and (based on leaks) the Holy Roman Empire, and the witch trials therein. So to sum everything up today, three new Assassins' Creed games were announced, with a look at the already-confirmed Mirage. So uh, this series isn't taking a break anytime soon.\nIf you want to skip to the Codename Jade footage, that starts at roughly 20:45 into the above video.\n\nThe post Ubisoft reveals a mobile Assassin’s Creed game set in ancient China appeared first on Destructoid.",

It will explore ninth century CE Baghdad, as the young orphan dives into the world of the Hidden Ones. And yes, that includes cutting a finger off.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x55lAlFtXmw\nThe reveal comes after several reports and rumors about the game. Ubisoft confirmed its existence prior to today's showcase, teasing more to come in the reveal trailer.\nGuiding Basim in his training is Roshan, voiced by Shohreh Aghdashloo. Here's the story rundown from the trailer:\nIn Assassin’s Creed Mirage, you are Basim, a cunning street thief with nightmarish visions, seeking answers and justice. After an act of deadly retribution, Basim flees Baghdad and joins an ancient organization – The Hidden Ones. As he learns their mysterious rituals and powerful tenets, he will hone his unique abilities, discover his true nature, and come to understand a new Creed – one that will change his fate in ways he never could have imagined.\n\nNo firm date has been set yet, outside of 2023. But with some excellent voice talent already on-hand and a focus on narrative adventure, this seems pretty interesting for longtime Assassin's Creed fans. Meanwhile, Ubisoft did reveal a collector's edition for Assassin's Creed Mirage.\n\nIf you want more to check out, Ubisoft also posted a developer breakdown of its reveal trailer on YouTube.\nThe post Assassin’s Creed Mirage follows the origins of Basim in 2023 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Following the launch of PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, multiple video game publishers bumped up the price of new-gen versions of some of their games. While Ubisoft resisted that trend to this point, CEO Yves Guillemot tells Axios in an exclusive interview that it is making $70 the standard price for bigger triple-A experiences published by the company. \nWe already knew that the new-gen versions of Ubisoft's long-in-development pirate game, Skull and Bones, would retail for $70, but now it appears to be the start of the standard pricing for Ubisoft. In that interview with Axios, Guillemot stated that \"Some of the games will come at the same price as the competition. The big AAA games will come at $70.\" \nIn 2020, Ubisoft CTO Frédérick Duguet said that games released in 2020 would not reach the $70 mark (and they didn't, outside of special editions). Then, last year, Duguet said, \"In terms of pricing, we've been analyzing the competitive dynamics of the past quarter, and we are still looking at new opportunities, but we have not made any decision yet.\" Today's Axios interview with Guillemot is the first indication that Ubisoft has come to an official decision regarding its pricing.\nUbisoft is far from the only gaming company increasing prices. Publishers like 2K Games, Activision, and Sony have been selling select games for $70 since the introduction of the new consoles in 2020. Meanwhile, just last month, PlayStation announced it was raising the price of its PlayStation 5 consoles in select, non-U.S. markets. Skull and Bones, the first $70 Ubisoft title, is set to launch on November 8. It's worth noting that new-gen versions of Assassin's Creed Mirage are currently listed on retailer websites for $50.\nYou can read the full interview with Guillemot, which touches on subjects like the Ubisoft's troubled workplace culture, the company's current approach to NFTs following Ghost Recon Breakpoint's integration of them, and plenty more here.",

Selling 3.45 million copies since Friday in just Japan, Splatoon 3 had the best launch ever for a Switch game in Japan, as reported by Eurogamer. \nThis includes both digital and physical sales. It's safe to say the squid (and Octoling) community are off to a great start with the threequel that's exclusive to Switch. According to Eurogamer, however, despite the game also being number one on the U.K. boxed charts, as reported by GamesIndustry.biz, overall launch sales are down 9% compared to Splatoon 2 there. The U.K.'s boxed chart only included physical games, though, so it's possible that decline isn't present when digital games are taken into account. There's no word on how Splatoon 3 is fairing in the U.S., but it typically follows trends in the U.K. \n\n\n\"Nintendo Co., LTD...announced that domestic sales of the Splatoon 3 game for the Nintendo Switch system have surpassed 3.45 million units in the first three days since launch on September 9, 2022,\" a Nintendo press release reads. \"This is the highest domestic sales level for any Nintendo software within the first three days.\" \nIt's no surprise Splatoon 3 is selling well in Japan and elsewhere – it's great!

          "description": "Following numerous leaks over the previous few weeks, Ubisoft officially revealed that Assassin's Creed Mirage is real. As expected, Ubisoft revealed a lot more about Mirage during today's Ubisoft Forward showcase, including the game's protagonist, setting, and more. \nIf you've been paying attention to leaks and rumors, you likely already had a good idea of what Mirage will be, doubly so after today's presentation. Basim Ibn Ishaq, the master assassin from Assassin's Creed Valhalla, is in the lead role this time around. However, he's not the polished warrior you might remember him as because Mirage takes place years before Valhalla. In this game, he's a young thief, and his playground is the luscious and diverse streets of Baghdad, Iraq. Set in 861, a period when Baghdad was the epicenter …",

          "description": "Ubisoft and Netflix have announced an expansion of their partnership that was first announced in 2020 with a live-action Assassin's Creed series that is still on the way and the Rabbids Invasion: Mission to Mars movie that arrived on the service earlier this year. Today, we learned that Netflix subscribers will have exclusive access to three upcoming Ubisoft mobile games as a part of their existing memberships, with no ads or microtransactions. This announcement comes as Netflix prepares to enter the gaming space with its first releases later this year.\nFirst up, is a sequel to Valiant Hearts, a World War I puzzle-adventure. This new title is in development by the team behind the first game and will bring a new story exclusively to Netflix members in January 2023. That same year, a sequel to Mighty Quest, the roguelite hack and slash, will arrive for subscribers. Finally, Ubisoft is currently working on a new, original Assassin's Creed mobile title, which, again, will be available exclusively to Netflix subscribers.\nIn addition to the Assassin's Creed live-action series, Ubisoft and Netflix are currently collaborating on three animated series: Captain Laserhawk: Blood Dragon Remix, Far Cry, and Splinter Cell. While Netflix is set to enter the games industry later this year, we'll have to wait until at least next year to experience these three new mobile titles for Netflix subscribers.",

          "description": "Huge reveals in video games, movies, and TV are currently unfolding at D23 Expo, Disney's annual consumer show held in Anaheim, California. Yesterday we received our first looks at an unnamed Marvel game, a new Tron title, and Mickey Mouse and crew teaming up in a platformer. Today, Marvel and Lucasfilm unloaded a flurry of announcements and trailers for projects hitting in 2022 and beyond.\nOn the Marvel Cinematic Universe front, we learned Fantastic Four will be directed by Matt Shakman, who worked on Wandavision and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Dominique Thorne's Ironheart will take on the villain The Hood (brought to life by Anthony Ramos) in the Ironheart Disney Plus series. Sam Wilson's first mission as Captain America in New World Order will be against The Leader, with Tim Blake reprising this role 14 years after 2008's The Incredible Hulk.\nWe also learned who the Thunderbolts are in the forthcoming film. The team consists of anti-heroes Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko), Valentina (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), Red Guardian (David Harbour), U.S. Agent (Wyatt Russell), Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen, and Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan).\nMarvel also treated us to our first looks at Secret Invasion, starring Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Emilia Clarke in an unknown role. And in just one month, we can watch the classicly designed horror film Werewolf by Night on Disney Plus. You can see both trailers below.\nThe Star Wars news is a bit lighter, consisting of our first look at The Mandalorian's third season, which looks absolutely bonkers in the best way. We also got a glimpse of the animated anthology Tales of the Jedi, hitting on October 26. The Bad Batch's second season hits on January 4, yet no new footage was shown. Andor also received a new trailer for the first season hitting in 11 days. The second season's filming is already underway! Again, you can see all of the Star Wars trailers below.\nThe Mandalorian: Season 3\n\n\nTales of the Jedi\n\n\nAndor\n\n\nSecret Invasion\n\n\nWerewolf by Night",

The crossover game, which combines the iconic Mushroom Kingdom crew with the zany Rabbids, looks to expand in the first 2017 turn-based tactical game in the series, Kingdom Battle, in myriad ways, including the new Sparks that can add various buffs to the heroes and debuffs to the villains.\n\n\nThis time around, we got a look at battles on a train, including Bowser joining the team. The battle takes place on the train as the crew tries to cleanse an angered Wiggler of corrupted darkness eyes as it runs alongside the train. Ubisoft also announced that it has post-launch plans including free DLC with the third content drop introducing a new playable hero: Rayman.\nMario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope comes exclusively to Switch on October 20.",

          "description": "Following the rocky and bug-filled launch of Battlefield 2042 last year, EA announced that Respawn’s Vince Zampella was named as the head of the Battlefield franchise amidst wider franchise changes that include the creation of a Battlefield universe. Then, a few months later, EA announced that its next Battlefield game had entered pre-production using “valuable lessons” learned from Battlefield 2042. \nWhile exactly what the next Battlefield game is remains confirmed, a new Battlefield-centric blog post from chief experience officer of EA Byron Beede and the Battlefield team sheds new light on a possibility. The next game might be a narrative-focused one set in the Battlefield universe. \n“Many of you know that Marcus Lehto joined the team earlier this year,” the blog post reads. “Today, we announced the name of his new Seattle-based studio, Ridgeline Games. Marcus will bring his long legacy of creating fascinating worlds and gripping narratives to Battlefield. Backed by a world-class team, he’ll be leading the charge to develop a narrative campaign set in the Battlefield universe that will engage fans in new and exciting ways while remaining true to the classic elements of the series.” \nAs you can see, the blog post doesn’t indicate that Lehto’s narrative game is the next Battlefield, but it’s a possibility, as is a new multiplayer-focused project like Battlefield 2042. Only time will tell. \nThere’s a lot more in the blog post, including the announcement that creative director Lars Gustavsson, who has been with the franchise since its start more than two decades ago, is leaving EA, so be sure to head there to get the full rundown. \nAre you excited about a narrative-focused Battlefield game?

          "description": "Before Vanillaware made its name with titles like 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim and Dragon’s Crown, it found early success with a little game called GrimGrimoire. The side-scrolling strategy title garnered a cult following when it hit the PlayStation 2 in 2007, but it got another shot in the spotlight this year with the Japanese launch of GrimGrimoire OnceMore in July. Now we know when players in the U.S. and Europe get to experience Lillet’s spellbinding adventure again or for the first time. \nGrimGrimoire OnceMore comes to the west in Spring 2023 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Switch. The game stars Lillet Blan, a witch-in-training who attends the famed Tower of Silver Star magic school, where things have gone awry. It’s up to her to uncover its dark secrets in an adventure that unfolds over a repeating five-day cycle. Though a side-scroller, players battle enemies by summoning and commanding Familiars in real-time strategy battles that unfold in a 2D perspective. \nOnceMore features HD graphics, a new skill tree, an improved user interface, an art gallery, and other unspecified features. \n\n\nFans may remember Odin Sphere making a similar comeback in 2016 with the Leifthrasir edition, and it’s cool to see GrimGrimoire get the same treatment.

Today, CDPR has released the same trailer with the English dub now. \nCheck it out for yourself below: \nQ: Will Cyberpunk: Edgerunners have English dubbing?\n#Edgerunners pic.twitter.com/oBFT3WmAFd\nSeptember 6, 2022\nAs you can see, the English dub sounds great.

There will be subtitles for each of those languages and many more too. \nAre you excited about Cyberpunk: Edgerunners? Let us know in the comments below!",

Winding footpaths led to expansive hubs at a scale unlike previous games in the franchise. Ornate chests holding rare equipment and Jötnar Shrines with lore murals were just some of the items awaiting wide-eyed players across six realms. Golden path locales like Midgard and its massive Lake of the Nine, Alfheim, home to light and dark elves, Helheim, the underworld, and Jötunheim, the land of Giants, were sprawling zones in their own right, filled with enough content to keep players engaged. Yet, the optional but equally impressive Niflheim and Muspelheim realms pushed player skills to the limit with vigorous combat trials.

Developer 1047 Games has announced it’s finally bringing the game out of its lengthy beta and launching it in 1.0 next month. It also revealed plans to create another title within the Splitgate universe. But to facilitate work on this next project, it will cease feature development of Splitgate.\n1047 explains in a press release that it’s developing a new shooter in Unreal Engine 5 set in the world of Splitgate, which means it will also feature portals. There aren't any more details beyond this, but it will be the team’s full-time project going forward. \nAs such, 1047 is launching Splitgate out of beta on September 15, but it will move away from creating substantial content after that. However, the team assures fans that Splitgate will remain online. The game’s launch will kick off a new season, which includes a new, free battle pass featuring an infinite number of levels along with new characters, skins, and other goodies. Splitgate’s weekly featured playlists, and item drops will continue, and the team will still work on smaller fixes and updates. \nYou can read 1047's full statement below (click to enlarge):\nSplitgate launched in PC beta in 2019, but the game really caught fire when its console beta began in 2021. The game became so popular on PlayStation and Xbox that servers regularly became congested, to the point that 1047 decided to postpone the full launch and keep the game in an indefinite beta to focus on further stabilizing the online infrastructure as the project continued to receive more funding. Season 0 began last August, adding a new map, game mode, and other features.",

It featured virtual panels with celebrities and filmmakers that provided new announcements, trailers, and early looks at all things DC media. In terms of video games, the 2020 and 2021 editions gave us substantial new looks at Gotham Knights and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. \nIn a statement to Popverse, Warner Bros. Discovery explains the decision by writing:\nFandome’s cancellation is an unfortunate blow in the ongoing transition resulting from April’s Warner Bros./Discovery merger. Although only two years old, Fandome has found great success, generating millions of views. Last year's show was highlighted by new trailers for The Batman, Black Adam, and The Flash. Unfortunately, the DC film slate has largely been flipped on its head since then as several projects have been delayed (Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, Shazam! Fury of the Gods), in limbo (The Flash), or canceled (Batgirl). \nWhile we won't see them during DC's big event, Gotham Knights launches on October 21, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League arrives sometime in 2023.\n[Source:  Popverse]",

It also features the first-ever look at the four house common rooms in Hogwarts Legacy, a sneak peek of some of the easter eggs in the game, and more. \nThis new featurette runs more than four minutes long and gives players the most in-depth look at the actual school of Hogwarts in this game thus far. As noted in the video, the design of Hogwarts is based on the eight Harry Potter movies and the books written by controversial author J.K. Rowling, who will undoubtedly be making money from the sales of this game. \nCheck out the featurette for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Hogwarts is looking great, as are the four common rooms. What’s especially interesting is it gives viewers a look at the Hufflepuff common room, which has rarely been seen on screen in the wizarding world, as pointed out in the video. \nWhat’s more, the featurette also contains information about linking your WB Games account to your Harry Potter Fan Club account. Doing so will automatically bring your Fan Club wand into the game alongside your Hogwarts house, which can be determined on the Fan Club’s site through a special sorting quiz. You’ll also unlock some in-game rewards for doing so, too, including a special decorative house robe and a beaked skull mask.

It seems Assassin's Creed Mirage will be the big highlight of the show, but it's possible we learn more about Assassin's Creed Infinity, which is Ubisoft's in-development Assassin's Creed live-service platform.

Leaks indicate that he's not yet an assassin at the start of Mirage and instead, a thief who comes to discover the Hidden Ones, which later become the Assassin's order in the series. Rumors also point to this game being a much more stripped back take on the franchise, feeling more like older games in the series rather than the massive and sprawling open-world RPGs of late.\nThe potential for this to feel like a bridge between classic Assassin's Creed and new Assassin's Creed has me incredibly excited. I love the new games, especially Origins and Odyssey, but they're downright exhausting. An Assassin's Creed game I can beat in less than 80 hours?
