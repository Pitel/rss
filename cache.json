That's because Wazzler is better known as Justin Wong, the fighting game legend and seven-time Marvel vs Capcom 2 EVO champ who has made it his personal mission to dish out devastation against anyone he meets online (thanks, IGN).\nIt all started on Steam (the collection doesn't support crossplay, fortunately, in this instance), with players quickly realising that Wazzler wasn't a foe to be messed with. In fact, platform reviews directly credit Wong as one of the game's downfalls — mostly as a joke, we should point out — with one user's 'Recommended' comment even asking Steam to \"please make an achievement for getting bodied by the Wazzler\".\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

An odd question thrown into a family-friendly round of Fibbage that leaves you frantically scanning the in-game moderation options or a well-endowed Drawful sketch that leaves everyone chuckling like embarrassed teens — we've all been there before. The Jackbox Naughty Pack is all about that feeling, a party game collection for adults that lands high on the ‘Rude Scale’, even if it’s not quite as blushing-ly bold as it seems to think it is.\nUnlike the previous packs, this Naughty edition is a three-game collection, with each game providing a cheeky twist on an otherwise ordinary Jackbox formula. At an initial glance, this isn't a lot of bang for your buck. The three games provide some decent variety, but at £19.69 / $21.69, it feels a little pricey compared to the usual full-fat, five-game ~£25 options.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It certainly had that effect on us, at least.

There's nothing to firmly suggest that this will change anytime soon, but thanks too a recent IGN inteview with Respawn Entertainment's Vince Zampella, there may be some hope that the franchise could see a release on Nintendo's eventual Switch successor.\nNow, it's important to make clear that Zampella does not comment on the 'Switch 2' specifically, noting that it \"isn't announced and it doesn't exist\". However, his praise for Nintendo certainly leaves the door open to some future partnerships when the new hardware finally sees the light of day.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Yes, hopping out of a storybook and making friends with an illustration on a coffee mug is cool. And yes, everyone can have a mildly fun time with its puzzles and fights. But that's the problem: who is everyone? At first I thought, \"This game is for young kids and that's fine!\", given its relative simplicity. Then I hit some puzzles and thought, \"Ain't no kid figuring this out\".\nThen it hit me. It struggles to balance the fine line between being approachable for tiny tots and layered enough for people who've graduated from \"goo goo ga ga\" to \"oo oo aa aa my back hurts\". And that's down to how plucky you're allowed to squire at any given time, because it can be surprisingly limited and, sadly, a bit underwhelming.\nRead more",

But it's a fun pseudo-history against which to create a grab bag of small games (some throwaway, others mighty) all designed with a distinct 80s look. It's an exercise in adhering to an aesthetic. Like an oil painter working with a limited range of colours, the developers of this bundle have stuck to a 32-colour equivalent of the Zorn palette. Yet play a little of each game, and you start to sense the smirk of chronos. These games aren't stuck in the past, but they are enjoying a holiday there. \nRead more",

Namely, that the majority of its pre-release buzz has centred around its proximity to Persona, and not its far more entertaining quality of having the most gleefully bizarre RPG enemy design this side of Elden Ring’s horn-tooting orbpeople.\nRead more",

          "description": "Why is every blockbuster video game now some kind of live service game? Speaking as a clueless idiot, the explanation I find most convincing is that it's an attempt to bridge the gap between the returns publishers want from video games, versus how much we're able or willing to pay upfront. \"Triple-A\" projects now cost exorbitant sums to develop, partly thanks to wider economic inflation, but also because publishers have spent decades teaching players that every sequel has to be More and Shinier. Premium game prices have not risen in proportion, and investors want growth, as they do.\nLive service games sneak around this difficulty by dragging out the time we spend playing them. Whether premium or free-to-play, they seek to install themselves as habits by means of regular, planned updates and additions. This is time that can be monetised by way of a subscription model, time in which other products may be sold to you, like skins and paintjobs, and time that becomes a commodity in itself, \"engagement\", which can be transmuted and exploited to various end. I'm not sure it's ever been expressed this way in any press release boast about longevity, but the unspoken principle/logical extrapolation seems to be that ideally, a live service game should keep us plugged in and plugging away till we die.\n Read more",

          "description": "Strange Scaffold’s newly released FPS I Am Your Beast is very fun for quite a few reasons, but chief among them is a deep appreciation for the poetry of good videogame violence. I’m not using the big P word just to throw out an overly worthy comparison to something we might associate with craft or beauty, but as a nod toward the game’s playful application of what I previously called ‘a euphoric splurge of murderous game verbiage’ one morning where I had clearly eaten my wordy Weetabix. The way its hurled knives and curb stomps and inexplicable decapitations flow together have an assonant, almost Suessian quality to them.\nBut it’s also, well, just a bit like Mad Libs. You play as Harding, a man who’s mythical lethality is established very early on. The showing is there in the moment to moment, but the telling is conveyed through cute tricks like how everyone you meet is so deeply afraid of Harding that they loudly keep track of exactly what weapon he’s holding at all times. The Mad Libs comes in through the fact that you can draw Harding a route between A and B, and it’s a given that multiple heads are going to come unstuck from necks along the way. You’re sort of just casually filling in the verbs that seem the most fun to you in the moment. One of the verbs is ‘hornet’. Hornet is a verb now.\nRead more",

          "description": "In theory, vampires and immersive sims go together as naturally as bats and caves. Immersive sims tend to involve a balance of stealth, acrobatics, raw strength and crafty manipulation, and vampires are celebrated for all of these things. Despite this, actual vampire-themed immersive sims are rare. My list starts with Vampire: the Masquerade: Bloodlines... and sort of ends there. In a devastating betrayal, Arkane Austin's Redfall wasn't an immersive sim but an open world co-op shooter (a not very good one). The much-delayed Bloodlines 2 was recently downgraded from immersive sim to RPG by new developers The Chinese Room. Arkane Lyon's Blade adaptation seems promising, but it's a ways off. \r\n\n\r\nHere to paper over the immersive vamping gap in the market is Byte Barrel's Trust, \"a new first-person shooter with immersive sim elements\". It takes place in a world where the vampires are hunted for their blood, which has become an everyday human energy source, used for everything from car batteries to streetlights. The irony! I feel like, in the circumstances, the ideal solution would be for humans to let vampires suck their blood in return for vampires letting humans use their blood for electricity, but that wouldn't make for a very thrilling shooter. Anyway, here's the trailer.\r\n \nRead more",

I like this premise almost as much as I dislike the fact that V Rising is also a survival game, in which you must fell trees and master a crafting system like a common turnip farmer.\r\n\n\r\nWhat do we hope for when our interest in a game is almost perfectly balanced by our disinterest? We hope that the developers will treat us to a free-to-play weekend, in which our perhaps-unfounded reservations might be strategically offset by the endorphin rush of not having paid any goddamn money. This, V Rising creators Stunlock have now done. The game is free to download and play on Steam from right now until Monday, 16th September at 5pm UK or 10am PST.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "There are many reasons to play and write about Arco. The Mesoamerican pixelart landscapes, for example - radiant, cloud-hung platters of land with people and buildings reduced to daubs of paint in the foreground. The fact that it's about witnessing and surviving colonial invasion, rather than the more familiar European or North American video game fantasy of searching a New World for plunder.\nThe ensemble storytelling, with four, successively playable characters setting their own lenses to thickly entangled themes of sorrow, vengeance and growing understanding. The sparse, expressive dialogue, each phrase carefully tucked inside its speech bubble. The music. And the little things at the level of how you move, what you do. When you pick a faraway destination on your map, your character makes the journey screen by screen, which gives you a second to lean back and be a passenger, watching the horizon, at least until you're ambushed by a giant beetle. \r\n \nRead more",

One that favours the joyous freeform sightseeing of an Elden Ring or Breath Of The Wild; where you’ll scramble up vast industrial concrete ruins on scavenging missions for inquisitive frogs, instead of being nagged by bothersome checklists?\nOk, rain check on that last point. SandWitch can’t help but eventually funnel the freedom of ambling around in your chuffy yellow van into restrictive collect-a-thons. Still, for much of its breezy runtime, this one’s a real panacea for gaming’s more bloated map-scourers. Plus, even when you are sent off to hamster-cheek scavenged components before making progress, there’s very little in this world that doesn’t feel intentional. Sidequests and storytelling crumbs are deliberately scattered throughout, and each building is a thoughtful concrete puzzle box. It is, in brief, a nice time.\nYou play as Sauge, a spacefarer returned to her planet of Cigalo after receiving a distress signal from her missing sister. Cigalo’s a cheery place, though economically and environmentally devastated after being exploited by an evil spacecorp named The Consortium. It’s populated by small settlements of people, some large talking frogs named the Reinetos, and the occasional friendly robot. Everything’s friendly, as it goes - even gravity itself. There’s no danger, no death, no damage from flinging yourself off the tallest building you can find. Just helping out your desert buds, upgrading your van with more gadgets to solve puzzles, or working on finding exactly where Sauge’s sister has go to.\n Read more",

But then you find an outlaw buddy who offers a new way to shoot human dirtbags. Then another fellow bandit. And another. By the time your spaceship is half-filled with scoundrels and weirdoes shouting at each other, the game has warmed up enough to reveal its central idea. This ain't no grand FPS campaign, nor is it quick as roguelikes go. It's a snacky shootout sim with tumbleweed towns that feels best when you savour the pre-fight suspense.\nRead more",

I like to walk in the woods around evening time, after a hard day of writing stupid listicles about Call Of Duty. Forests are a critical preoccupation of mine, actually - check this lumpen thinkypiece I wrote about Alan Wake 2 - but they're also spaces for retreat and reflection, where I can shrug off the angst and lose myself in the spectacle of sycamores and silverbirch, arching over the path.

          "description": "The Gearbox developers working on Risk Of Rain 2 have released a patch for its poorly received expansion, Seekers Of The Storm. The recent DLC for the action roguelike came out of the oven a little doughy, with enough game-breaking bugs to thoroughly upset some fans. Including one bug that sometimes made the game's final boss accidentally invincible. Ah. Yesterday's patch seems to target the worst of these bugs, and the dev team promise there are more fixes are to come.\nRead more",

It wasn't that I fell out of love with the idea, just that I can't physically do it.\" That was then and this, thankfully, is now.

This is what it is like to be Jerry, the janitor of a cheap and poorly maintained space station. Jerry is being tasked with repair work beyond his job description, learning the ins and outs of an escape pod's machinery from his co-worker via radio. This may come in handy, as the station is about to explode. Tin Can is not a new game (it came out in 2022) but it is on sale as part of Steam's space exploration fest.

          "description": "As you expand your castle's layout, you may be inclined to switch things up a bit to establish your particular design. However, once you attempt to change it, you may receive a notification to get rid of the station first. \n\n\nIf you are unsure what to do, we'll show you how to remove stations in The Elder Scrolls: Castles.\n\n\nHow do you remove stations in The Elder Scrolls: Castles?\n\n\nYou can remove a station in The Elder Scrolls: Castles by pressing and holding it, triggering a red icon in the bottom-left corner. Then, drag it to the crate icon to get it out of the castle.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nFortunately, you won't lose out on the materials, as the station will now be transferred to your inventory. Open the build menu, and you should see an available card for the station.\n\n\nIf you simply want to move the station, you can perform the same interaction of pressing and holding it. This can be useful when you're reorganizing your castle layout or when you want to optimize the placement of your main areas. Just make sure to have enough room available, given that some builds require more space than others.\n\n\nYou can also remove the room itself when in build mode's Room section. Press the left-most symbol with a square symbol, then tap on the area you want to remove. Like the stations, you'll gain the materials again, allowing you to use them elsewhere. The flooring and stairs work the same way, so don't stress about any unused resources.\n\n\nKeep these steps in mind for the future since you'll likely be making more room for the advanced stations. This includes bigger domains like the War Table, Shine of Mara, and Workshop.\n\nThe post How to remove stations in The Elder Scrolls: Castles appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Hifumi Kono's original 1995 Clock Tower game is finally making its way over to the U.S., and it's doing so two days earlier than Japan. WayForward's Clock Tower: Rewind revival is now set to launch on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC in the Americas and Europe on October 29, 2024.\n\n\nOutside of folks who have played the ROM or watched Shinya Arino brave its horrors on Game Center CX, most westerners likely first encountered the series on PlayStation. WayForward's update takes the Super Famicom classic and breathes new life into its horrifying hallways. The original gameplay is still intact along with the graphics and sound, but now there are some quality-of-life improvements in the mix along with added features. \n\n\nThat fresh content can be found in Rewind mode. There's a new animated intro, as well as functions like save states, rewind (hey, it's in the title!), a music player, art gallery, and vocal songs by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn and Emi Evans. There's also the aforementioned Clock Tower Commercial Sampler demo for a nice piece of video game history. You can get an idea of how it's shaping up in a recent gameplay video:\n\n\n\n\nIt's very appropriate that Japan gets this one on October 31, but two days earlier ain't bad. Either way, it's the perfect time of the year to spend running like mad from Scissorman. \n\n\nBeyond the Clock Tower update, WayForward set a release window for River City Girls 2's Double Dragon DLC. Bimmy and Jimmy will join the brawl sometime this fall, which is a slight delay from the original summer plans. \n\nThe post Clock Tower: Rewind arrives in the west two days before Halloween appeared first on Destructoid.",

However, if you search long enough, you might spot a little banana character next to a small village square marker.\n\n\nWhile it may not look like much now, this place known as NaN'er Hamlet or NaNa Village is where most of this area's fun comes from. Here's how to find NaNa Village in LEGO Fortnite.\n\n\nNaNa Village location in LEGO Fortnite\n\n\nThe exact spawn location of NaNa Village, known in-game as NaN'er Hamlet, differs with every world seed. Although the Lost Isles' land masses don't change, the spawn spots for Klombos, various NPCs, and NaNa village do. Although using a set seed will guarantee you find it in the same location every time, looking for it on a random world means you'll have to run around Lost Isle until you spot it.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nFortunately, there's some good and bad news. The good news is that the actual appearance of the NaN'er Hamlet never changes. The bad news is that it's a small village square statue with one character, Bananthony, next to it. Considering Lost Isles' size, you might have to search for a while. \n\n\nBananthony and the NaNa Village marker can spawn in the jungle, on a beach's coastline, or in random plains biomes around Lost Isle. Although plenty of random buildings will spawn around the area, NaN'er Hamlet is the only place that specifically spawns a village square and Bananthony. Watch for his colorful appearance, the village square structure, and its peculiar dirt patch to help you spot it. Otherwise, you'll need plenty of luck or a custom world seed to make the search easier.\n\n\nOnce you find NaN'er Hamlet, you can speak to Bananthony and interact with the village square marker to begin upgrading this little settlement, much like you would with any other village or the Rebel Outpost from the Star Wars event.\n\nThe post Where to find the NaNa Village in LEGO Fortnite appeared first on Destructoid.",

Of all of them, Haven is one of the most helpful allies to set you on the best path. Here's how to find Haven in LEGO Fortnite.\n\n\nWhere to find Haven in LEGO Fortnite\n\n\nYou can find Haven by upgrading your Lost Isle village to Level 2 or creating a new world in LEGO Fortnite. For a quick and easy route, use the second option to travel to Haven's Village automatically. Select Cozy or Survival when setting up a world; you should interact with the character immediately afterward.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThose who don't want to start a new file can use the Bus Station's fast-travel to reach Lost Isle. Set up a base there and upgrade it to trigger Haven's appearance. If she doesn't show up, try to level it up again to, hopefully, produce her spawn. Once you speak to Haven in LEGO Fortnite, she'll want a place to stay. Upgrade your Village Level to meet her requirements.\n\n\nHaven will enlist you in a few more tasks to better acquaint you with Lost Isles, including the acquisition of the new Mahogany Wood. You can also claim rewards from the Best Friend Klombo task, earning you Studs for the Tropical Treasures LEGO Pass.\n\n\nHow to tame a Klombo in LEGO Fortnite\n\n\nOnce you've completed the Talk to Haven quest, you'll unlock the Tame a Klombo objective.

Here are the defining features, as per the patch notes:\n\n\n\nReduced inn fees for staying at an inn.\n\n\nReduced price of Ferrystones.\n\n\nMore difficult for weight carried to become \"Heavy\" or \"Very Heavy.\"\n\n\nLess Stamina expended when dashing outside of battle.\n\n\nLoss gauge will not increase when selecting \"Load from Last Save\" after the Arisen dies.\n\n\nPawns will recover from dragonsplague without a \"devastating calamity\" occurring, even if the symptoms progress to a terminal stage.\n\n\n\nThat’s not nothing, but some of the tweaks are weirdly specific. It’s easier, but it’s not exactly dumbing things down to an unreasonable level. I wonder if there are less specific changes they aren’t telling us upfront, like a change in damage given/taken.\n\n\nSpeaking of oddly specific, the rest of the patch notes seem like that. A port crystal being added to Bakbattahl seems like the most exciting addition, since it will be a massive convenience. Aside from that, there are things like new idle animations and new items that can be traded with the Dragonforged. It’s nothing spectacular outside the new difficulty.\n\n\nThere are a lot of balance changes to vocations, as well. It’s a lot to take in, so I’m going to direct you to the patch notes again for the specific details. There are also a tonne of bug fixes. I didn’t notice very many issues when I played it back around its release, but this looks like a lot.\n\n\nDragon’s Dogma 2 is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC. The described patch is available today.\n\nThe post New Dragon’s Dogma 2 patch includes casual difficulty, if you’re feeling filthy appeared first on Destructoid.",

THQ Nordic announced plans to release the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S versions on October 15, 2024. \n\n\nYou'll be able to hop back in Death's ethereal saddle for $29.99. Those who already own the PS4 or Xbox One versions, however, can snag Deathinitive Edition as a free upgrade. For everyone else, there's a half-off discount in place for pre-orders until October 14. \n\n\nPreviewed below, the PS5 and Xbox Series version of Darksiders II adds 4K resolution, ray tracing, and enhanced lighting. There are also haptic feedback features in place for PS5's DualSense controller, and both versions have improved loading times. \n\n\n\n\nDarksiders II was fantastic when it debuted on PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 way back in 2012, and the upgraded edition has been a great way to play for nearly as long. Beyond the upgrades unique to current consoles, Deathinitive Edition adds in all the downloadable content and some fine-tuning to the loot distribution and game balance. Other aspects — including character, and environmental visuals — have also been tweaked since the initial launch. \n\n\nMost of all, I respect THQ Nordic for sticking with a title as silly as Deathinitive Edition for so long.

          "description": "EA has announced that the next game in the skate. series is scheduled to drop into Early Access in 2025. This will be the first entry in the series since skate. 3 in 2010. Shortly after, EA laid off most of the developer’s staff and shut down the studio. Last we heard, Deran Chung and Chris Parry who worked on the original run of games, are part of the team handling the new skate.\n\n\nI haven’t really been keeping up with the development of the new skate. (which is apparently just called skate.). I think I lost interest when it was announced that it would be free-to-play and multiplayer focused. Actually, repeating that still sticks in my craw since my wish for a new skate. game did not include GaaS.\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re down for that sort of thing, EA has been holding playtests since 2022 to collect player feedback. The developer has said that there will be no loot boxes, no maps locked behind paywalls, and no pay-to-win. So, that’s maybe comforting, but that still leaves cosmetics as microtransactions. We’ll have to wait and see.\n\n\nI loved the skate. series. I love Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, as well, but they’re two completely different approaches to skateboarding. skate. feels a lot more authentic. You try and find the perfect line to build the most gnar gnar combo possible. The stick-flicking controls gave everything a more tactile feel.\n\n\nBut really, I have no interest in a live service multi-player game. Thankfully, I still have the original three games on PS3, so I can always turn to them. They’ve aged well.\n\n\nskate. is coming to early access on 2025. More details to come.\n\nThe post New skate. game kickflips into early access in 2025 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Dobří herci, dobrá atmosféra, slušně řemeslně natočeno, občas dobrý vtip, ale scénář není nic moc a pokud o titulní postavě nic nevíte, je to místy dost zmatené (kdo je kdo, proč dělá to, co dělá, a proč by vás to mělo zajímat).
