With Bombservice specifically, the team has always boasted a strong understanding of what makes Metroidvanias ‘click’, and with Momodora: Moonlit Farewell, it’s delivered what may well be its finest game yet.\nThe latest chronological entry in the series, Moonlit Farewell is a noticeable step up from its already-excellent predecessor, Reverie Under the Moonlight, in terms of scope, visual design, and gameplay. Right from the start, you’re greeted by stunning scenes of pixel-art wizardry, with Bombservice showcasing its mastery of colour and atmosphere. This extends to the characters and enemies, with each and every bizarre creature feeling both alien in design and yet perfectly suited to Momodora’s ethereal world.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

G.Rev’s most famous work, and the one that put it on the map, is Border Down: a wonderfully original 2003 shooting game for Sega’s Naomi arcade hardware and Dreamcast console. It was followed in 2006 by Under Defeat, switching from the horizontal to the vertical and trading sci-fi for a grounded militaristic theme.\nNot to be confused with that other Dreamcast helicopter shoot 'em up, Psikyo’s Zero Gunner 2, Under Defeat pits pink-haired German soldier girls against the enemy forces of “The Union”. While any real-world similarities are dispelled by impossibly giant gunships torn from the pages of anime fiction, one of Under Defeat’s more interesting aspects is how hard-boiled it feels.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

This ends the fight immediately. Sometimes I resort to this low move out of frustration, when a dull fight has dragged on for too long. Sometimes I resort to it out of panic, because I’ve accidentally set fire to every hard surface within ten feet, or frozen myself to a wall. Often it’s just for the pleasure of it. \r\n\nIn Eternal Strands, Yellow Brick Games’ debut title, you play the leader of a \"weaver band\", a crew of freelance magicians, in a world where something extremely bad happened to magic. Some years ago, the Enclave, a city state acting as the isolationist heart of the world’s magic, exploded in a kind of power surge - one part tsunami, one part blown fuse - and just as quickly sealed itself off from the world outside. Somehow managing to breach the wall, your band finds themselves the first people to set foot inside the ruined capital since the calamity and sets about uncovering the mystery of what exactly went wrong. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Summarised as a \"slice of life tamagotchi\" and available in Spanish and English, it's a gamejam production from Francisco Riolobos, Chuso Montero and Deconstructeam, the Valencia-based developers behind The Red String Club and The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood.\nIt's free to download from Itch.io, and takes the form of a snowglobe perspective of somebody's one-room apartment. The person in question has just left their job after a rough spell, and has impulsively bought a guitar. They are also, however, totally exhausted, with barely the willpower to do anything beyond getting out of bed, let alone make music. Your task is to help them through each day and rebuild their morale till they feel able to pluck a few chords.\n Read more",

Firstly, some heavy slowdown while roaming Trosky Castle, the centerpiece of the opening Bohemian Paradise region, which I resolved by quitting and reloading. Secondly, a mildly terrifying moment in a dugout when a wounded soldier I was supposed to be treating struck a T-pose, as though afflicted by lightning early onset arthritis. And thirdly a repeated crash bug which I feel warrants its own article given that, together with Deliverance 2's eccentric saving system, it cost me several hours of progress.\r\n \nRead more",

Thanks, Eurogamer. For first noticing the case, I mean. I'm not blaming Eurogamer for the drone crash. Not this one, anyway.\nThe drone was traced back to Akemann, who has agreed to plead guilty to one count of unsafe operation of an unmanned aircraft. That's a misdemeanour that usually carries up to one year prison time, but he's \"hoping to escape the prison term in exchange for 150 hours of community service in support of wildfire relief and the approximately $65,000 USD it cost to repair the plane,\" write Eurogamer, as part of a plea agreement.\nRead more",

Resident Evil 4, Fallout 3, Gears Of War - all bleary examples of a grubby visual style. This peaked in Clive Barker's Jericho, a shooter so desaturated it felt like the colour settings on your monitor were banjaxed. I have heard this called \"the piss filter\" and generally lamented in industry circles. But it was always a puposeful choice, intended to add some grittiness to the world. And there's at least one developer who is reviving \"smeared dirt\" as an art direction. As Time Surrenders is a very brown stealth game that takes a lot of inspiration from Metal Gear Solid V.\nRead more",

It’s a mostly AI-powered technology at a time when mistrust in artificial intelligence, fuelled by underbaked applications and anti-creative policies, is at all-time high – not to mention how the new GeForce GPUs it’s released alongside, the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090, have immediately entered 2020-style stock shortage purgatory.\nHowever, having tried it out in a few different games, I suspect time will prove kinder to DLSS 4 than the RTX 50 series launch has been. It is, in fact, a rather nifty collection of upscaling improvements that can help out older graphics cards as readily as the very newest, while building on DLSS 3’s frame generation tool with Multi Frame Generation (MFG) to send visual smoothness skyrocketing. If you care even the slightest iota for how your PC performs in modern games, DLSS 4 demands your attention.\nHere, then, I’ll break down DLSS 4’s various tricks and components, looking at how they really affect performance – and whether it’s worth upgrading your rig to maximise compatibility with it.\nRead more",

Well, part of a poem. Both to free up room on the disc and perhaps, to edit out \"the vast sorrows and all the vexations\" of the second half, only the first two stanzas appear. The recording in fact ends halfway through a line, which conjures up an intriguing problem for the listener, inasmuch as the thwarted rhyme scheme reveals that the piece is incomplete. A poetically-minded alien might be tempted to fill in the gap. A fancier alien who took a module in postmodernism might hail the poetics of the fragment. A resolutely practical alien who thinks poetry is for losers might read the whole thing, instead, as a set of incoherent navigational prompts, made up of loose prepositions - au-dessus, au-dessus, par delà, par delà.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Mere hours before it’s January 30th release – wait, that’s today! – Sony have finally spilled the beans on system requirements for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, as well as the eye-blistering, GPU-rending special features that more powerful rigs can support. Happily, all these ray tracing and frame generation accoutrements seemingly won’t preclude Spidey 2 from working on older, slower PCs as well, as the minimum specs are surprisingly reasonable.\nGranted, they’re only rated for 30fps at a lowly 720p, and you’ll still need to find a honking 140GB of SSD space, but the basic GPU and CPU requirements aren’t too lofty at all. The likes of an RTX 3060 for 60fps/1080p are quite reasonable as well, though you’re staring down the barrel of Nvidia’s pricey RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 cards for high-rez ray tracing.\nRead more",

It's been eight months since PlayStation provoked mass annoyance among PC players by making a PSN account mandatory to play Helldivers 2, and later Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered. They soon walked back the decision for Helldivers 2 after a rough review-bombing but the company didn't seem to fully take the hint. It looks like they've now conceded that, yes, the obligatory sign-up was an unpopular move.\nRead more",

Among Phantom Line's headline features is the HUSK system, which lets you switch between members of your squad right in the middle of combat. Unless, presumably, the body in question is already occupied by one of your co-op partners.

The RTX 3080 was a thing of beauty, only to be tarnished by the worst wheeler-dealing spree (and crypto mining misappropriation) in PC component history. Then the RTX 4080 rocked up with its laughable £1269 / $1199 price tag, a miscalculation so severe that the RTX 4080 Super looked good – despite hardly being any faster – simply for not repeating it. For the new RTX 5080’s sake, you almost want it to be boring.\nIt isn’t. But then, neither is it a blood-boiler like the RTX 4080, nor a largely aspirational show-off piece like the RTX 5090. By maintaining the 4080 Super’s course correction on price while tooling up on compelling DLSS 4 improvements, the RTX 5080 is an agreeable GPU from the off. Particularly, if you’ve got the 4K monitor to take full advantage of it.\nRead more",

The two of you must now fight to the death to decide who is the letter-opener and who is the letter.

          "description": "A performance and settings guide for a ropey PC port of a Final Fantasy game? Sweet, I haven’t done one of these in four whole months. In fairness to Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, which Nic says can be great as a game per se, it does make some effort at settling into Windows. It has rebindable M+K controls. It has DLSS. It has generally more consistent framerates than FFXVI, which could bait you in with silky visuals before grabbing your head and shoving it into the cold ice bath of sub-30fps.\nYet it also steps back from that game on its supported tech, while raising its hardware requirements so far above Final Fantasy 7 Remake that it won’t even launch on a lot of older graphics cards. Even so, hitching and microstuttering issues from FF7 Remake return once more, along with plenty of other signs that this PC version didn’t get the love that a lot of other erstwhile PlayStation exclusives – like Horizon Forbidden West or God of War Ragnarök – did for their ports.\nRead more",

Have Ubi delivered? I think there's a strong chance.

Dick’s cheese dreams. At least two of those points will, I’m sure, send the average graphics card shopper running, especially at a time when even game developers are growing suspicious of generative AI and its many-thumbed, robot-voiced nostrums.\nYet while there’s not much to be done about the RTX 5090 costing at minimum £1939 / $1999, hundreds more than the infamously spenny RTX 4090, its suite of more purely performance-focused artificial intelligence tools is – dare I say it – quite neat. These range from Multi Frame Generation (MFG), which is basically DLSS 3 frame gen but up to twice as fast, to DLSS 4’s general upscaling enhancements and even the ability to apply newer DLSS versions to older games. All this will come to the rest of the RTX 50 series as well, with some trickling down to the enter RTX range, so maybe the RTX 5090 is best understood not as a practical GPU purchase in itself but as a Picadilly Square-filling advert for its more affordable siblings can do.\nRead more",

I haven't taken a shower in days and a fly has gotten into the cab, buzzing around my ears, anticipating the feast that will come from my sweaty summer death. I just spent nearly an hour driving this tractor to the shop, buying car parts, and rumbling back in the dark. I took my eyes off the road for two seconds to turn on the headlights. It was a mistake. The road curved sharply and I went off a steep bank, tipping my tractor on its side. The door is stuck, the tractor's wheels spin helplessly. There is no recovering from this. I restart the game for the third or fourth time, not knowing whether to laugh or sob.\nMy Summer Car is as hardcore as they come. It does not simply throw you in at the deep end. It ties you up in a cloth sack with 50 kg of lug nuts and dumps you in the Baltic sea. \"Sink or swim!\" yells this game at you, but in Finnish, so even that you cannot understand. To a certain kind of person, this is an act of love.\nRead more",

          "description": "This review contains some story spoilers for the original FF7 and subsequently some elements of Rebirth, but doesn't spoil how Rebirth ultimately reinterprets these elements. \nI argued with myself for several weeks in university about whether to go to a seminar discussing T.S. Eliot's The Love Song Of J. Alfred Prufrock. The poem meant enough to me that I didn't want to dissect it with a class. I wanted to keep for myself. I went in the end, and though I hesitated, I talked because I had things to say. It didn't kill the poem for me, but it does have a slightly awkward gait now, having never quite recovered from the incisions.\nI now have to etherise Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth. Cait Sith is splayed upon a table. It's all scalpels, forceps, and oversized novelty dice. It's a strange way to treat art you love. The feeling I remember most from Rebirth on release is how grateful I felt to be alive to play it. Acute, active awareness of my own mortality with thoughts like \"it would be properly shit if I died right now because I'd really like to see how this pans out\". A personal 'never kill yourself' moment months before the meme gave voice, as the best often do, to an obscure and precious feeling.\nAn RPG where your character sometimes knocks on doors before opening them? What a time to be alive.\nRead more",

Thing is, it doesn't seem like Capcom's been able to do much in this respect after all, because the new set of system requirements is a real disappointment.

In the midst of thousands of players stepping back into the boots of Henry, developer Warhorse Studios has been getting praise from one of the industry's biggest names.\n\n\nIn a recent post on X, CD Projekt Red posted to its Witcher account to wish congratulations on the release of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. The heartfelt message also wishes for your blade to \"always be sharp,\" and is accompanied by a friendly image of Geralt of Rivia embracing young Henry in what I can only describe as something the cool kids may refer to as some sort of \"bromance.\" Correct me if I'm wrong, obviously.\n\n\n\n\nWarhorse itself posted a response under this post, thanking CDPR for the kudos, adding that the team was \"raising a glass to you now.\"\n\n\nKingdom Come: Johnny Silverhand edition\n\n\nInterpret it as some sort of corporate publicity thing if you will, but it is quite nice to see some of gaming's biggest studios giving props when new titles come out. It probably helps that The Witcher and Kingdom Come series both have similar vibes and aesthetics. Watch out for a mod that plops Geralt right into the heart of Bohemia [citation needed].\n\n\nAs mentioned above, Deliverance 2 has been doing pretty well within the last 24 hours. According to recent data from SteamDB – which tracks all things related to Steam – the game peaked at nearly 160,000 players since yesterday. At the time of writing, about 130,000 Henries (plural) are adventuring.\n\n\nBy the way, if it's been a while since you played the original or you're completely new to the series (as I am), the studio very handily put out of Story Recap video recently. That should bring you up to speed before you go diving straight into Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.\n\nThe post CD Projekt Red gives props on Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2’s release appeared first on Destructoid.",

Mutt will be separated after being attacked at the camp, so the onus is on you to find him. You can fast-track this process by going to the spot where Mutt hides post the attack and it will allow you to add him to your party quicker. \n\n\nMutt's location in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2\n\n\nTo find Mutt, you'll have to travel to the northwest part of Semine, and the spot is close to the river. Just take he road from Semine, and you'll reach a point from where the road takes you to the forest. Mutt is actually near a wolf cave, and you can find in southwest of the Nomad's Camp. Hence, you can also quick travel to Nomad's Camp and start your journey from there. Either way, the key is to head into the forest. \n\n\nOnce you approach the cave, you'll find Mutt whining, and being surrounded by a wolves. You'll have to save him from the wolves, and this quest also serves as the tutorial towards how you can command your dog to perform certain actions. You can choose to flee, but the wolves are pretty easy to dispose off, and you'll gain XP in the process of doing so. \n\n\n\n\nJust press your your L1/LB button to look for Mutt, and you'll get to interact with him, feed him, or send him to your home. \n\n\nYou can also find Mutt while completing the Invaders side quest. This quest allows you to interact with the Cumans, and Henry will follow Vasko's trail up the hill. If you keep following the quest objective, you'll be led directly to the cave. You'll again come across the same cutscene and set of actions, but the fight will be harder as it will be night and Henry will be drunk.

          "description": "Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 not only allows you to unlock different skills as you level up, but it also allows you to rectify your choices and make changes along the way.\n\n\nIt's quite natural that you may want to change the way Henry operates in the game, and some skills might start to seem less useful in the long run. Thankfully, there's a respec system in place that allows you to start from scratch.\n\n\nHow to respec your skills in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2\n\n\nUnlike typical RPGs, resetting your chosen skills requires a particular item called Lethean Water. This item, in fact, is a potion whose in-game description reads as \"forget all earthly experience\". Whenever you use this item, you'll reset your selected skills. You can then use your available skill points in a fresh way.\n\n\n\n\nBest ways to get Lethean Water\n\n\nYou can either buy Lethean Water in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 or craft it on your own. If you want to go for the first option, visit an Apothecary. By spending about 120 in-game currency, you'll be able to buy the potion and use it.\n\n\nIf you want to go for the second method, you'll need to get the recipe and brew the potion yourself. Just like the potion, you can also buy the recipe directly and craft it using the required ingredients. It's worth noting that the recipe costs more than the potion. But it's better in the long run for you to get the recipe and craft using the ingredients.\n\n\nYou'll need the following items to craft one Lethean Water.\n\n\n\nTwo Wormwood\n\n\nOne Belladonna\n\n\nOne Henbane\n\n\n\nOnce you have the resources, head to the Alchemy Bench. Grind the Wormwood and add it to the Cauldron, followed by Belladonna to brew for three turns. Finally, add the Henbane to distil the potion and use it when you want.\n\nThe post How to respec skills in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 (Lethean Water guide) appeared first on Destructoid.",
