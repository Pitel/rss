Such a statement might strike fear into your heart, and we wouldn’t blame you. After all, many attempts by third-parties to imitate Nintendo’s design traits and tricks have fallen flat thanks to poor execution or a lack of understanding concerning what made such mechanics so great in the first place. The Wild at Heart, however, is one of the most successful stabs at playing Nintendo's game we’ve seen in some time.\nFeaturing a mix of gameplay elements from Pikmin, Luigi’s Mansion, and The Legend of Zelda, The Wild at Heart might, on paper at least, seem like it has no ideas of its own, instead being perfectly content with hanging on the coattails of Nintendo’s finest. However, despite pulling most of its mechanics from other games — not unlike the similarly magpie-like (and excellent) Death's Door — thanks to its well-realised world, engaging characters, and stunning visual design, developer Moonlight Kids has managed to craft something that feels wholly unique.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It's worth noting the raider can take on the form of Cell, Buu and Frieza - and each antagonist comes with their own unique powers. Survivors will also be able to transform into famous legendary super warriors.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

But before then, Epic are currently giving away a whole other manner of slaughter, the hunting sim TheHunter: Call Of The Wild.

Still, when an invitation to the third phase of its ongoing closed beta test arrived, I couldn’t help but get excited. These are the folks behind NieR: Automata and Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, after all, and now they’re making a live-service, co-op slasher. Sign. Me. Up.\nAs it stands, the closed beta only showed a very small, very early build of the game, but we’ve got some thoughts. Combat, exploration, and co-op were all on offer here, and there’s a fair amount to unpack. Look beyond the early build jank and there’s definitely potential.\nRead more",

I walk past sheep and hope they don’t shuffle away from me this time, as it could mean we’re finally mates. At night it gets really dark, darker than you think is possible. An owl screeches and it scares the bejeezus out of me.\nYeah, it’s nice out here. But getting into the village by car is a challenge. The roads are wobbly and narrow, with little patience for noisy machines. This means I’ve had to stop and let other cars pass a lot. At first it was irritating, but now I’ve come to enjoy it. Getting a wave or a flash of the lights warms the heart and can turn a bad day into a good one. It strikes me that multiplayer games lack this fleeting comradery, which is a shame.\nRead more",

If Mass Effect were to be adapted into anything, I'd much rather it be a potentially long-running series rather than a film so it has enough time to establish its excellent sci-fi setting. However, we need to talk about what story Amazon could potentially take from the games. To me, it seems likely they'd follow the trilogy, which I reckon is the right move.

Sometimes it can be all too overwhelming to figure out what parts are good for a fast computer, but don't worry - we're here to help. \nWD - or, Western Digital - have been on a crusade to rival Samsung's computer bits for a while now, and may have finally achieved it with this SSD. In layman's terms, it will kick your computer into super speed, running games and operating system super fast and quick like. This particular SSD supports the PCle 4.0 standard, allowing for much faster read and write speeds than the older 3.0 interface. As Katharine found in her WD SN850 review, this drive is also both faster and cheaper than its big PCIe 4.0 rival, the Samsung 980 Pro.\nRead more",

          "description": "I've always found it hard to get excited about the Men Of War series. This is admittedly partly down to the name. Short of outright calling your game \"War\", Men Of War is about as generic a title as you can get for a video game. And I think this was at least partly reflective of the games behind it. Men Of War has generally delivered dependable real-time tactics games, but the series has never excited me in the way that, say, Relic's Company Of Heroes does.\nSo it's a promising sign that, at the end of Best Way's demonstration of the just-announced Men Of War II, I came away keen to play it. Not only does it look slicker and more user friendly than earlier games (without compromising on the depth that appeals to the series' core fanbase) there are a couple of ideas it’s playing with that lodged themselves in my mind like chunks of grenade shrapnel.\nRead more",

Partly because it’s not a Friday in any meaningful sense; what feels like a majority of deals start at least a fortnight in advance and continue well into the following week, an almost month-long commerce safari. The best Black Friday deals? Uncountable, not for lack of trying.\r\n\n\r\nI have mixed feelings about it, clearly. I get why some people hate it. But I like having better computer stuff, and I like not having to spend as much money to get it. They’ve kind of got me over a barrel here. Still, while I’d never begrudge anyone climbing above the bottom layers of the ol’ Maslow’s hierarchy, it’s worth making sure that you’re only buying the things you want – not the things a big red “percentage figure off!” sticker makes you think you want. With that in mind, I asked around the RPS crew whether there’s anything specific they’re keeping an eye out for this Black Friday.\r\n\n \nRead more",

There’s nothing like walking down the street with your Gameboy banging against your knee. Sadly, as technology shrank faster and faster, so did trousers, until everyone was stuck with skinny jeans that you can’t even squeeze a bit of change into.

But there’s a problem: the lights are out, down in these concrete depths. The zombies are strong here. Special banshee-like screechers are primed to alert their undead brethren to the presence of any would-be intruders, prompting an unending wave of decaying meat to fling itself at you, all teeth and claws.\r\n\n\r\nSo this mission requires more finesse. You need to use all that agility and poise you’ve mastered in Dying Light 2’s impressive parkour 'n' puching open-world city, sure, but you also need to layer more skills on top of that, cherry-picked from the new toolkit Techland has provided.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Clean, powerful shots trace across immaculate skyboxes, straight into the shining dome of your armoured clunkperson, with a frightening thud that is satisfying even in death.

Truly, a timeless classic of clicks and scrolls.\r\n\n\r\nOf course, the G502 has come in a few different flavours, but you can now get one of the most recent models at the lowest price it’s ever been (at least in the UK). Amazon has the Logitech G502 SE Hero for £34: an entire pound less than the standard G502 Hero has ever dipped to, most recently during Prime Day 2021. \r\n\n\r\nUS denizens aren’t missing out either, as the G502 SE Hero is $33 at Best Buy in their own Black Friday sale. That’s not quite as cheap as its all-time low of $28, but its still a very good price on a very good mouse. The G502 SE Hero is essentially the classic G502 Hero with some white go-faster stripes – there’s been no funny business making adverse changes to keep the costs down. \r\n \nRead more",

For many of us, me included, that means stuffing our faces with delicious treats like we’re in training for Fat Bear Week. What's your favourite? Mine's the \r\nlebkuchen hearts with apricot filling, plus anything with marzipan.\nThe point I’m trying to get to is that this isn’t really a slim and sexy time of year for me. More of a fat and cuddly (but still sexy) season. On the other hand, this Alienware m15 R4 gaming laptop is both slim and sexy, as well as a full $500 off in Dell's early Black Friday sales.\nRead more",

We've needed an RTS revival for ages, right? And this one is good, if a bit safe.\nFor the last few weeks I've been puzzling over the lingering feeling that it could have been more ambitious. Why do I think it could have pushed the trireme out further? Is it possible to make a modern RTS that captures the best of the classics without simply rehashing them? Has it even been done already and gone unrecognised?\nRead more",

At first we got ports years after their Xbox debut, then Microsoft just stopped releasing Windows versions for their flagship first-person shooter series. Well, that's changing with Halo Infinite, which is coming to PC at the same time as Xbox—including the Halo Infinite multiplayer beta launched last night. So I ask you, an audience with less exposure to the sci-fi shooter: how are you liking it, PC gamers?\nRead more",

You play as a stranger, Aiden, travelling to this once-majestic capital to locate his missing sister, and the second you step foot into its guarded walls you’re faced with a city kitbashed together from pieces of Paris, Berlin, Hamburg, Ostrow and other European landmarks. In Villedor proper – a city that’s been designed by actual town planners and urban designers – you see the scope of what Techland is going for. This is a big game, with some big ideas.

The 36-year-old former full-back, a Stockport native and lifelong fan of the Vanarama National League club, has a tactical style best described as 'my dad after three pints'. Route-one, 4-4-2, and no 'larking about'. He thinks a gegenpress is something you use to get the creases out of your trousers.\nHattrick is a quintessentially English anachronism, whose ignorance of the modern game represents my own unfamiliarity with modern Football Manager. It's been quite some time since I last sported the greying temples and Fray-Bentos paunch of football's favourite scapegoat, and returning to Football Manager is a bit like meeting up with an old girlfriend after they've had their consciousness uploaded into an all-knowing AI. I vaguely recognise the face behind all the ones and zeroes, but that person I once snuggled up with on winter evenings has ascended into something vast, intimidating, and utterly obsessed with data.\nRead more",

The next you're left scratching your head and wondering how the heck you're meant to proceed. It wouldn't be much of a puzzle game if there weren't a few moments like this, of course, but when you're playing out mechanical riddles across five possible surfaces - in this case, the sides and top of a rotatable cube - Moncage can sometimes veer into giving you a complete cerebral blackout, leaving you at an impasse until you consult its series of timed hints (or, if you're really desperate, an in-game video solution). \nWhen the lightbulb pings into bright, brilliant existence, though, Moncage can be truly illuminating. As you rotate, prod and investigate its five little vignettes to line-up matching bits of scenery in one tile to affect the corresponding bit in another, Optillusion's debut game harks back to the best bits from Fireproof Studios' The Room series. It's a beautifully crafted little thing, and it builds on its ideas to create some genuinely standout moments of optical wizardry. If only the story it was trying to tell was half so elegant.\nRead more",

Pro PHP je to po 10 letech Nikitova plodného působení na PHP a v JetBrains citelná ztráta, neboť z něj odchází člověk, který v sobě nosí významnou část expertízy a znalostí. Projekt tak přichází s velkou změnou, aby bylo do budoucna zajištěno co nejlepší fungování. Přivítejme nadaci zvanou PHP Foundation, o jejímž založení se v projektu diskutuje už od května tohoto roku.",

After eleasing the 2D Zelda-inspired Hyper Light Drifter in 2016 to critical acclaim, fans of the game clamored to see what was next and many were surprised to see something totally different. Solar Ash is bigger and bolder than Hyper Light Drifter in every way, from its switch to a fully 3D world to its new emphasis on high-speed traversal over combat-focused dungeon crawling. But what is Solar Ash? Heart Machine’s creative director, Alx Preston, took us through a tour of the game to discuss its origins, gameplay, and how he is coping with the fear of the sophomore slump.\nIn Preston’s words the “stupid elevator pitch” for Solar Ash is Super Mario Galaxy meets Shadow of the Colossus.

On December 4 at 4 p.m. ET, the Cube Queen is waging war against all of the combatants on the Island in a new limited event called \"The End.\"\nThis event is a one-time instance, meaning you won't be able to play it again after you complete it. Epic recommends content creators and players record their playthrough as it will be the only way to see it again.\nThe End allows for groups of up to 16 players to queue together. Friends can get together 30 minutes before the event begins. This current season is ending a day earlier than Epic originally announced, so anyone who logs in now between December 4 will receive a 225,000 XP reward. Players who compete in The End event will earn a themed loading screen and wrap. From November 26 to 29, Epic is holding a power-leveling weekend with supercharged XP to help players complete the battle pass.\nWhat comes next is anyone's guess. Epic will likely continue on with Chapter 3 and a new theme. We know Boba Fett is coming to the game, and there are rumors that The Matrix will be involved as well.\nWhat do you hope to see from Fortnite next? And what did you think of the current chapter?

This week, 343 Industries introduced the game's first limited event called Facture: Tenrai.\nFrom now until November 30, players can make progress on a new 30-tier battle pass, with the ultimate goal of unlocking a complete set of Yoroi Armor. The Tenrai battle pass is free, and although it isn't here for long, 343 Industries states that it will return at future dates, starting again in January. All progress made on the battle pass now will carry over when it returns.\nMost unlocks on this new battle pass come after gaining experience by completing challenges in the limited-time game mode: Fiesta. This 4-versus-4 skirmish gives random weapons to every player each time they spawn. Rockets, swords, and sniper rifles are all a part of the mix.\nOn top of this event, 343 Industries has set 10 a.m. PT as the weekly date that Halo Infinite's shop is restocked with new gear. This week, players can purchase the Chonmage Armor set (for 2,000 credits, which is roughly $17.99). Along with the samurai-like armor, this bundle includes the Thorn Diver legendary stance, Sundown Smile epic armor coating, and the Chonmage epic helmet.\nOther items in the shop include the Sentinel's Blade legendary utility, which comes with the Sentinel epic nameplate and emblem. If you want your weapons to have a little more style, the Shinobi Wrap decal is available, and gives your weapon a lilac-steel color, along with a Shinobi wrap model and a Shuriken charm. The last item available this week is the Six Date Loyalty bundle, consisting of the Noble Loyalty epic armor coating and two sixth gate shoulder pads. You can see all of the offers below:",

Other than that, details are scant other than Harmonix games like Rock Bank will continue to stay up and running, though expect the developer to leverage its talents in Fortnite sometime in the future musical talents as well.\nEpic has, of course, been dipping its toes into interactive concerts and musical performances in recent years, and that trend will undoubtedly continue and expand with a team like Harmonix under its umbrella. If any team can top what Epic has done with experiences like last summer's Ariana Grande performance, Harmonix would be the group to do it. \nDoes this make you hopeful for more dedicated music games, or are you potentially excited for more rhythm content in Fortnite? Give us your thoughts on the Harmonix acquisition in the comments below.",

In those eight weeks, the conversation around this choice has focused on the accent of the famous plumber. Will he be doing the traditional Mario accent, or will he do something else?\nIn a new interview with TooFab, Mario movie co-producer Chris Meledandri has defended Pratt’s casting, calling his voice for Mario phenomenal. \nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\n“All I can tell you is the voice that he’s doing for us, and Mario, is phenomenal,” Meledandri told TooFab. “Yeah, I can’t wait for people to hear it.”\nTooFab asked the producer about the decision to cast Pratt, someone who isn’t Italian, as the Italian plumber. Meledandri said he’s an Italian American and understands some of the feelings people have over the casting choice. He said Charlie Day, who is Italian, being cast as Luigi, is this movie’s nod to the Italian background of the famous plumber duo. \nHowever, Meledandri adds that you can expect the Mario movie to touch on the Italian accent, or rather, lack thereof. \n“We cover it in the movie,” he said. “So, you’ll see we definitely nod to that.” \nMeledandri also said that you should not expect Pratt’s performance to lean too much into the “It’s a-me, Mario!” side of the character, popularized by Charles Martinet, who’s been the voice of Mario for decades. \nWhile waiting to hear Pratt’s Mario, check out the full cast list for Illumination’s Mario movie.\n[Source: TooFab]\nWhat do you hope Pratt’s Mario sounds like?

There’s the limited edition Adidas shoes, the fancy Halo Xbox Series X, and more. Now, there’s a digital Xbox museum you can peruse through, too. \nGetting there is quite simple – head to museum.xbox.com. We highly recommend signing in because doing so will create a museum space unique to you that features information about your history with Xbox as a brand, your achievements, and more. That’s not all, though. Within the museum are multiple other sections for your metaverse-like avatar to visit: the original Xbox, the Xbox 360, the Xbox One, the Xbox Series X/S, and a Halo section. \nAs you walk through each museum section using your keyboard, you can place your 3D avatar into yellow circles on the ground. These circles are found in front of museum exhibits and once in the circle, you can interact with the exhibit to learn more. For example, in the original Xbox space, there’s a circle in front of an exhibit with the title “Bill Gates and The Rock join forces to unveil Xbox.” Upon interacting with this exhibit, you’ll be taken to an interactable story that features information about this unveiling, a video of the event, and more. \nThat’s what each of the digital exhibits is like, too, and it seems like making your way through the entire museum would take hours. It’s quite an expansive lineup of information, not to mention it features your own personal history with Xbox in a section as well. \nHead to museum.xbox.com to tour through the exhibit yourself and then catch up on some of Game Informer’s Halo Infinite coverage – it’s Halo’s 20th birthday too this year, after all. After that, check out these Xbox 360 Adidas sneakers and then take a look at this new Halo Xbox Elite controller. \nWhat’s your favorite Xbox memory? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "When the PlayStation 5 was first revealed last year, the console design was polarizing. On one end of the spectrum, PlayStation fans were excited about the new futuristic, sleek look. In contrast, other consumers were not as impressed, namely in regards to the white faceplates. Once the next-gen console launched, third-party companies began producing different colored faceplates, with black being one of the most popular options on the market. Sony, for the most part, legally brought an end to those competitors. And now, the entertainment conglomerate has been granted its own patent for official PS5 faceplates. \nAccording to GameSpot, the patent is listed as a “Cover for Electronic Device” and comes paired with a few mock-up sketches of the PlayStation 5. The text within the patent claim mentions a “Skin cover for PS5 console” and “the ornamental design for a cover for an electronic device.” \nOf course, this doesn’t immediately equate to a future where Sony-labeled faceplates might be sold at your local electronic establishments. For all we know, nothing will come of this. But it’s nice to imagine a new look for the PlayStation 5. Only time will tell what this patent means for the console’s aesthetic. \nDo you think this is simply Sony cornering the market without the intention of actually releasing faceplates? Or are we going to see this patent put to use? Throw down your theories in the comments below! \n[Source: GameSpot]",

As reported by GameSpot, it’s not that Reeves isn’t a fan of Mortal Kombat – he just thinks John Wick and Neo don’t belong. \n“If it was up to me? No, Mortal Komat is awesome in so many ways, but I think...you know, Neo, John Wick, they’re doing their own thing,” Reeves told Esquire. “Mortal Kombat is doing their own thing.” \nLook, Reeves certainly knows these characters more than us Internet folks who want to see Neo lean back to dodge Scorpion’s infamous “get over here” chain attack, but c’mon, no to John Wick as well? That character is a trained assassin that has killed anyone in his way – surely Sub-Zero doesn’t stand a chance. \nRegardless, there might still be a chance despite what Reeves says. As noted by GameSpot, Mortal Kombat and its developer NetherRealm are owned by Warner Bros. which is the same company that owns The Matrix franchise...so the possibility is there. In fact, Game Informer reported in 2019 that series creator Ed Boon said NetherRealm was “pretty close” to adding Neo to Injustice 2. \nSpeaking of Injustice 2, check out our thoughts on the DC fighter in Game Informer’s Injustice 2 review and then read Game Informer’s Mortal Kombat 11 review.

          "description": "Hitman 3 has been out for nearly a year, and while its first year of content was expansive, Year 2 is shaping up to be just as big, if not bigger. \nIO Interactive, the developer behind Hitman 3 and the two Hitman games that came out before it, released a new blog post today detailing the game’s first year. IO revealed that Hitman 3 is the most successful Hitman game of all time and that its World of Assassination Trilogy has reached the milestone of 50 million players. It also revealed that Year 2 is starting in less than two months.\nClick here to watch embedded media\n\n\n“Hitman 3 – Year 2 will start on [January 20, 2022] with post-launch support confirmed for another 12 months,” IO writes in the blog. “New maps, storylines, modes, and ways to play are all lined up for 2022, which is set to be another exciting year.” \nAlso, coming to Hitman 3 next year is ray tracing on PC. Plus, PC VR support is coming in January, as is a new Elusive Target Arcade mode. \n“A new way to play Elusive Targets arrives in Hitman 3 in a brand new game mode that we’re calling Elusive Target Arcade,” the blog post reads. “Prepare to take on the ultimate Elusive Target challenge in a change to the established formula in this fan-favourite game mode. All Elusive Target Arcade content will be a permanent addition to the game. Full details on how this game mode works will be shared in early January 2022.”\nThe blog post ends with a “[REDACTED] update that states that IO has a “major update to the game planned” for Spring 2022.

This news comes after multiple delays for the Pocket, most of which occurred due to ongoing shipping struggles and chip shortages due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. \nIf you preordered the Pocket, you should have received an email already from Analogue that states the Pocket will ship in three weeks. That email also includes information about delaying your order should you be out of town for the holidays when it’s delivered. \n“We understand that some of you will be away during the holiday season and would prefer delivery in the new year,” Analogue’s announcement reads. “With this in mind, we are offering to hold your package over the holiday period and start shipping on January 3. If you cannot accept delivery between December 14 and December 30, you should request a hold for your order.”\nThe final date to change your order is November 28, and Analogue says no changes can be made following that. The email you’ve received includes more instructions on how to go about those changes, if necessary.

All it takes is one glance at his Instagram feed to realize that. His primary focus has always been games, but it seems his studio, Kojima Productions, is preparing for a shift to other entertainment mediums. \n“Today, I can finally confirm that Kojima Productions will be opening a new business division in California, USA,” division lead Riley Russell writes in a press release. “The new division will be tasked with working with creative and talented professionals in television, music, and film, as well as the more familiar games industry. The team has as its charter, the goal of expanding the reach and awareness of the properties now under development at Kojima Productions, and to make them even more a part of our popular culture.” \nKojima Productions business development manager, Yoshiko Fukuda, says this new division will take the studio into new sectors to develop narratives beyond video games. \nAs for what to expect first from this business division, that’s unclear, although Russell does mention that it will focus on expanding narratives outside of games based on games currently in development at the studio. Perhaps it’s cooking up a Death Stranding TV series, or maybe a film based on some game the studio is working on that hasn’t even been announced yet. Only time will tell. \nWhile waiting to learn more, check out Game Informer’s thoughts on Death Stranding and then read this story about why Death Stranding Director’s Cut is worth another trek across America. \nAre you excited about a possible movie or TV series from Kojima?

Samus faces off against Dark Samus for the first time, one of a series of challenging boss encounters that cemented Echoes as the most challenging entry in the Prime series – for better or worse. \nJoin hosts Ben Reeves (@BenjaminReeves), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), and Nintendo Ambassadors/Metroid fanatics Ky and Kyle Parker (@CaptDangerous64, @admiralboogaloo) for the next hour as we explore Metroid Prime 2's lore, development history, and lasting impact. \nIf you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

However, poor reception from consumers has spurred Rockstar to make the originals available through the Rockstar Store.\nIn an announcement on its website, the developer explained the decision saying, \"The updated versions of these classic games did not launch in a state that meets our own standards of quality, or the standards our fans have come to expect.\" Owners of the PC edition of the remaster through the Rockstar Store are being taken care of. Rockstar says, \"We will be adding the classic PC versions of Grand Theft Auto III, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas back to the Rockstar Store shortly as a bundle. Additionally, everyone who has purchased Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition for PC from the Rockstar Store through June 30, 2022, will receive these classic versions in their Rockstar Games Launcher library at no additional cost.\"\nWhile this make-good takes care of specific PC gamers, there's no word on those who own the package on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, or other PC storefronts. Rockstar does say it's committed to fixing the issues with GTA: The Trilogy stating, \"We have ongoing plans to address the technical issues and to improve each game going forward,\" and, \"A new Title Update is on the way in the coming days for all versions of Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition that will address a number of issues.\"\nLast week on Twitch, Andrew Reiner and I explored GTA: The Trilogy for a few hours, and while I had a pretty good time waxing nostalgic with the series, I was fairly put off by some of the graphical changes.
