Romero's Dawn of the Dead in 1978, the publication and subsequent adaptation of The Walking Dead, the hugely popular 'Zombies' mode in the Call of Duty series, or the meteoric rise of The Last of Us, we love a date with the undead.\nThis fascination with these brain-munching beings has inspired games by the boatload. Yes, there are the two aforementioned series, but the list of great zombie games goes on. The Switch, for the most part, has steered clear of these big titles. There are a lot of zombie games on the console for you to sink your teeth into, but the number of them that we would actually recommend playing?

Aquariums are my happy place. They're fascinating, beautiful, entrancing, and for a kid who grew up pretty far away from the ocean, basically magic.\nSo why do I dislike fish Pokémon so much?

It's got a demo you can play right now, and it's adding free daily challenges with a sharable leaderboard later this month. I am hyped.\n\n \nRead more",

Calling Kandria a platformer feels a little reductive, so there's a need to clarify why it works. You play as an android revived several decades after an apocalypse, by a tiny camp of survivors who inevitably need your help. A lot of this help involves, well, platforming. To the point of having nonsensical areas of pure platforming in between you and a destination or secret area. You'll climb, jump, do the little dash thing that recharges when you touch the ground or pick up a hovering lamp thingy. You'll land on a lot of thorny instakill spikes.\r\n\n\r\nSo yeh, lots of the old platforming, but it feels more like an exploration and scavenging game, with a side order of light-light-heavy-dodge combat too. And a plot with varied dialogue options and mysteries about the world and its history. It's immediately and consistently fun, but I'm not sure exactly how to recommend it. Hmm.\r\n\n \nRead more",

One of them was Broken Roads, an isometric RPG set in a post-apocalypse Australia. The gorgeous artwork was enough for me to click on the Steam page and read more, and while scrolling through the screenshots something strange caught my eye.\nIt was a screenshot of a fairly traditional RPG dialogue scene, with a panel at the bottom displaying all the possible dialogue options for the player. But what caught my eye was an unusual radial graphic on the right-hand side of the options. Reading on, I discovered that Broken Roads uses a rather unique Moral Compass, one which plots your overall moral stance towards the world and its people with a golden arc. Different decisions may rotate the arc, expand it, contract it, lengthen it, or shorten it. And in so doing, you'll unlock various traits dotted about the Compass, which only remain in effect for as long as that golden arc covers those traits within the wheel.\nI can see a dozen different ways in which this Moral Compass may end up being a bad idea in practice. But I don't care. I adore it. And I'm going to play Broken Roads solely so I can see the consequences of my actions in satisfying radial form.\nRead more",

          "description": "GOG has decided to scrap their GOG Connect service, which allowed users to claim a limited selection of games they already owned on Steam for free. The service was quietly killed off at the beginning of this year and removed from GOG’s site, which didn’t go unnoticed by frequenters of the GOG subreddit. GOG confirmed the closure of Connect to RPS fan site PC Gamer, saying “for a long time nothing really happened there, so we've decided to shut it down”. Fair enough.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Eventually, I became a lead and then a QA manager at a studio,” she tells me, as we talk at India Game Developers Conference in Hyderabad, India. Now, Tiger is at Paradox Development Studio as the studio manager of Studio Black, and the former lead producer for Crusader Kings 3. She even stood in front of a suit of armor to drop the game's first tease.\r\n\n\r\n An RPG-esque lifestyle system and neat backstab choices that deal with information round out Crusader Kings 3's host of improvements over its excellent predecessor. A court-themed expansion and a revamp of the game’s culture system after launch are a testament to Paradox’s resolve to deliver a refined plotting experience. Holy wars and illicit affairs go hand in hand in the world of Crusader Kings and the third iteration is no different. Weaving together systems to consistently deliver emergent gameplay is no simple feat, and it turns out that production also covers all manner of small but essential, and practical things. As the lead producer on a game as complex as Crusader Kings 3, Tiger had her work cut out for her. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Too many mods got waylaid in Planet Half-Life screenshot roundup hell by a desire to make everything expansive and professional-grade. So I'm delighted by a mod for 2017's Star Wars Battlefront 2 which knows its core: it is funny to see dinosaurs do things that dinosaurs shouldn't be doing. So the JurassicFront replaces character models with dinosaurs, and away you go, shooting dinos around Naboo and the Death Star. That's the joke.\nRead more",

The next 12 months is set to be a banner year for interstellar adventuring, and kicking us off in just under four weeks time on February 2nd is KeokeN Interactive's Deliver Us Mars. As I found out last year, Deliver Us Mars looks like it's going to be quite the step up from its prequel, Deliver Us The Moon, both in terms of its cerebral, pulse-racing puzzle-solving, and its shift from a silent, first-person protagonist to fully-voiced, third-person heroine, Kathy Johanson - a fact that game director and co-founder Koen Deetman tells me has been long in the making. \n\"You have to bear in mind that Deliver Us The Moon was our debut into the games industry,\" he tells me. \"We’d envisioned multiple ways to make this the greatest game of all time, but to some extent you are bound by reality and what you can make within a budget and timeline, so some of these decisions were made out of necessity. That’s why the narrative and its scale has significantly risen with Deliver Us Mars – we’ve had the opportunity to give that side of the game a lot of more of our time and attention.\" \nRead more",

When I first asked the team to put together their most anticipated games for 2023, I was thinking we'd have a reasonably sensible number of things we were all looking forward to, you know, somewhere in the region of the 43 games we highlighted at the start of 2022.

The game dropped on all major platforms last year, and earlier this week, it finally made the jump to mobile through Netflix Games. While I’ve already enjoyed Shredder’s Revenge on my Switch, I wanted to see how it played on my Pixel with and without a Bluetooth controller.

          "description": "Licensing is a killer problem\nLast Friday was the 13th, and ironically, it was one of the last Fridays that you'll ever be able to buy Friday the 13th: Killer Puzzle. It's sad to see this young spatial puzzle game, not even old enough to drink, snuffed out so soon.\nIn all seriousness, Killer Puzzle is as loving a tribute to the slasher franchise as you could ask for. For the most part, it follows the rules of the film series (Jason can just appear behind anyone he sees, is weak against drowning, etc), and features just about every iteration of the hockey-masked horror icon as you could ask for (including his green and purple look from the infamous NES title).\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8Ylirqs8To&ab_channel=BlueWizardDigital\nSo if you want to get this slice of the life (and afterlife) of one of the most loved and feared fictional serial killers in history, you'll have to act fast. Due to an inability to renew the license, this particular Friday the 13th game and all of its DLC are being removed from all available storefronts ( So that's Steam, Apple App Store, Google Play Store, Nintendo eShop, Xbox Store, and Playstation Store) on January 23.\nThe only encouraging thing about this turn of events is that Killer Puzzle was itself a retooling of an original title called Slayaway Camp that will be available indefinitely. So while this specific game in the horror-puzzle formula subgenre may be sinking into the depths of history forever, there's a chance that it may come back to the dead someday, maybe with a whole new outward-facing look.\nMaybe the Killer Klowns are looking for more work?\nThe post Friday the 13th: Killer Puzzle gets slashed for good on January 23 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The player can rotate the tank through a 360-degree landscape, utilizing radar to locate the attackers. Senjyo was highly praised in its day for using parallax scrolling and forced perspective to give the illusion of 3D visuals, though some players were frustrated by the sluggish movement of the tank itself.\nCheck out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Old Classic Retro Gaming.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wM2HUVMa8vQ&ab_channel=OldClassicRetroGaming\nSenjyo would head to western arcades in 1984, arriving just in time for the market crash. Undaunted, developer Tehkan would eventually return with several sizeable hits for the home and arcade market, eventually changes its name to the more localization-friendly \"Tecmo\". As I'm sure nobody needs reminding, Tecmo would merge with Koei in 2009 to form Koei Tecmo, which is today best known for franchises such as Dead or Alive, Dynasty Warriors, Monster Rancher, and Fatal Frame.\nSenjyo is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nThe post Experience Tecmo’s formative years with Arcade Archives’ Senjyo appeared first on Destructoid.",

All of a sudden, seemingly every developer pivoted to competitive fisticuffs, with seemingly hundreds of Street Fighter-alikes hitting arcade centers — many featuring developers and IPs seemingly plucked out of thin air.\nAnd while a few of these releases would carve out a piece of the pugilistic pie for themselves — such as Mortal Kombat and eventually The King of Fighters, there was a whole wave of titles that fell by the wayside.

I hope that your year has gotten off to a fine start and that this is a really happy and prosperous weekend for you. My weekend, unfortunately, will be spent with my arch-enemy, Maths. It is January, and that means that the tax office is breathing down my neck even though I paid it last year. How much money do they want? The answer is all of it. Still, this is why the trains run on time, there are fleets of fire engines on our streets, and our beloved, devoted NHS service is fully funded — with all its workers fairly compensated...

          "description": "What is it they say about sunk cost again?\nAt this point, I don't know where to start with Beyond Good & Evil 2. It holds the record for the game with the most time in development, and has become the poster child for development hell. Seeing as Ubisoft just announced a whole host of game delays and cancellations, I thought for sure the long-awaited sequel would be on that list.\nMuch to fans' relief, however, Ubisoft has just confirmed that Beyond Good & Evil 2 is still very much alive and well in a conversation with PCGamesN. The game's development is still \"underway and the team is hard at work to deliver on its ambitious promise,\" an unspecified Ubisoft spokesperson disclosed.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9VPnI34dPw\nBeyond Good & Evil 2 was announced all the way back in 2009, but got its first trailer nearly a decade later at E3 in 2017, as well as a cinematic trailer the following year at the same event. The original is a cult classic that came out in 2003 for the PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Microsoft Windows, and even if the sequel dropped tomorrow, it would be crazy to think it skipped three whole console generations. If I had to put money on it, I'd bet it'll skip at least for by the time it eventually releases — optimistically assuming that it ever will at all.\nThe post Beyond Good & Evil 2 is still on the way despite Ubisoft cancellations appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Let's roll\nKatamari Damacy is one of those games that you don't hear about a lot these days, and yet someone everyone seems to have played it at some point in their lives. The premise is simple, but it's so engaging that it'll keep us coming back for more every time. Just when I thought it was impossible to improve on the tried-and-true Katamari formula, a modder came along and proved me wrong in the best way.\nOriginally spotted by Time Extension, computer scientist and custom controller enthusiast Dr. Tom Tilley created a \"super cheap\" controller setup to roll his way through the game using some empty roll-on deodorant packaging, some cardboard, a computer mouse, and a soccer ball, or football for the non-Americans. Tilley rigged the setup work with an emulated PS2 version of Katamari Damacy, and the video he posted on YouTube makes me wish I had a version of it myself.\nhttps://youtu.be/PHPJ2wTBJlo\nA roller-ball is the way to go with this game, which is evidenced by the fact that Tilley wasn't the first one to build a similar prototype -- back in 2014, a YouTuber by the name of Siage uploaded a video of another prototype for a custom Katamari controller. I think this one might actually be my favorite seeing as it swaps out the soccer ball for one plastered with the faces of Disney princesses.\nI can't see a future where mass production for such controllers would make any sense, but I'd love to see some full-scale implementations in the form of some Katamari Damacy arcade machines. I want 2023 to be the year that we bring both arcades and Katamari back into the limelight of public consciousness, and then combine them together to achieve my new life's goal -- playing this game with a roller-ball controller.\nThe post This custom Katamari controller is the only way I want to play the game from now on appeared first on Destructoid.",

The formula is set, you just have to build the where, why, and how behind it. This lets the developers really go wild when making some of these games. As a child of the arcade heyday, I have fond memories of classic games like Final Fight and X-Men. But one element that always stood out to me was just how batshit crazy some of the boss designs were. \nYou could just tell that the developers wanted the biggest, weirdest thing to show up and make the players go “wow”, and it worked.

However, it looks like those deals have finally expired, because the sequel to Tom Clancy's online action role-playing game is now available to play through Steam. If you've been wanting to play the title on PC but didn't want to go through either of the Epic or Ubisoft stores for whatever reason, now's your chance to grab it on your platform of choice.\nAs exciting as it is that The Division 2 is up on Steam there are a few caveats to consider — for one thing, the game doesn't come with any Steam achievements, which can absolutely be a deal breaker for achievement-hunting types. If nothing else, it's a bit of a bummer. Then there's the fact that while you launch the game through the Steam storefront, you still have to go through the Ubisoft Connect launcher, which is another headache in and of itself.\nhttps://twitter.com/UbisoftSupport/status/1613642068043210757\nThe Division 2 has also been met with mixed reviews on Steam, as many players have encountered bugs and technical issues. A good handful of players have had the game crash on them, which Ubisoft says they are currently looking into. Hopefully they can iron out these issues as the company continues to migrate more of their games to PC, especially with the next title to get this treatment will likely be the behemoth that is Assassin's Creed Valhalla.\nThe post The Division 2 is now available to play on Steam appeared first on Destructoid.",

The Resident Evil First Aid Drink Collector's Box is available to pre-order now from the GameFlavor website.\nAccording to the press release, the box contains 10 x 330ml First Aid Spray Cans, each containing a uniquely flavored drink based upon the herby nature of the Resi series. Also included are four \"Ink Ribbon\" cases, filled with a distinctly blended spice mix, as well as a pseudo spray cap for the can, and a list of cocktail recipes. Each set is housed in a replica \"Storage Crate\", individually numbered to one of 4,750 available sets.\n\n \nAs you might have guessed from its extremely limited nature, the Resident Evil First Aid Drink Collector's Box does not come cheap, and will retail for a princely €199.90, (or roughly $210). Not a typo. At that price, I'm assuming that the drink has the exact same magical restoration properties of its video game counterpart, but that's probably pretty unlikely. Still, if you're an ultra die-hard Resident Evil fan, or you simply like crazily expensive \"on trend\" drinks — I hear that's a thing for The Kids these days — then you can pre-order your own set right now from the official GameFlavor website.\n\nThe Resident Evil First Aid Drink Collector's Box is expected to ship in the third quarter of 2023.\nThe post Resident Evil ‘First Aid Drink Collector’s Box’ available to pre-order appeared first on Destructoid.",

Rocking her big ol' shoes — Bullet Yo-Yo in one hand and haunted companion Roger in the either, our girl looks set and ready to embark upon her next Bridgetquest.

For whatever it's worth, Spiratale's typical character figurines tend to stand at a 1/7 scale and usually run around the $200-$300 dollar mark. So the more hardcore fans among you might have to start saving up the pennies. To be clear, this price is pure speculation on my part, merely based on the company's previous releases.

Just like the Charizard event, there's a second chance weekend.\nThat second chance kicks off today (right now actually), and will run through January 15. You have roughly two full days to unlock 7-star raids if you haven't already, then locate and take down the Cinderace.

Right now all we have to go with is wording on the Charizard news post (which Cinderace did not get), which technically only applies to Charizard currently: \"Charizard may appear again in other events or be encounterable in different ways in the future.\"\nYou still have time if you haven't clean up that postgame path to 7-star raids yet!

The animation ends with his twilight era, which sees Ryu a wiser, more spiritually content warrior who — despite his advancing years — will never cease pursuing the thrill of the fight.

          "description": "World of Words\nEpic Games Store has revealed the next title that it will be offering up gratis for its huge army of users — Available to download from January 19 to all users, it's the unique, narratively driven Epistory: Typing Chronicles.\nDeveloped by Belgian studio Fishing Cactus and released back in 2016, Epistory is the tale of a young girl, who rides a three-tailed fox around a constantly evolving origami world, under attack from an array of paper spiders and other crease-tastic bugs. Epistory: Typing Chronicles is a particularly original title from both an aesthetic and gameplay standpoint. Not only is its delightful paper world incredibly cool and inviting, but the game's story and world unfolds, (quite literally), via the player's typing ability. It's a unique, smartly conceived concept, which you can see in action for yourself in the trailer below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1qg_8JKojE&ab_channel=FishingCactus\nThe player follows on-screen typing prompts in order to control our hero, defeat their enemies, and advance the core story itself. Much like other word-based video games, such as The Typing of the Dead, speed and accuracy will be the tools necessary to progress through the adventure, accessing new areas, while protecting our foxy friend from an increasingly aggressive army of bugs. Epistory is a very novel release, and almost worth the price of admission alone for its beautifully crafted origami universe.\nEpistory: Typing Chronicles will be available to download from the Epic Games Store from January 19. Until then, you can still pick up murder mystery freebie First Class Trouble from the EGS dashboard.\nThe post Epistory: Typing Chronicles is the next Epic Game Store freebie appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Did they only just hear about it?\nIn the latest chapter of a story set to run throughout 2023 and beyond, industry giants Google and Nvidia have reportedly expressed concern to the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over the proposed purchase of Activision Blizzard by publisher Microsoft.\nAccording to a new report by Bloomberg, internet developer Google and graphics card company Nvidia have both provided the FTC with testimony in preparation for the latter's upcoming lawsuit, filed against Microsoft in early December 2022. It is reported that the testimony demonstrates concern that the purchase could give Microsoft an unfair advantage in regards to lucrative issues such as gaming subscription services, mobile gaming content, and cloud gaming support.\nThe supposed complaints from Google and Nvidia would join the previously aired opposition from Sony, which is most likely concerned over the possibility of losing access to Activision's billion-dollar shooter franchise Call of Duty. Should the lawsuit go to trial, which at this point seems incredibly likely, then spokespeople for all three companies could, in theory, be called as witnesses for the FTC's case. And that's a particularly mighty trio of brands to face down, even for Microsoft.\nMicrosoft needs to find favor of the FTC before its $68.7 billion dollar purchase of Activision Blizzard can go ahead. Even once the lawsuit clears, MS would still need to seek approval from other global regulators, including the European Commission and the UK Market Authority. Furthermore, regardless of the result of the trial, both parties have the option to appeal the judge's decision, seemingly guaranteeing this debacle will run into the tail-end of the year and perhaps even into 2024.\nGoogle, Nvidia Express Concerns to FTC About Microsoft’s Activision Deal [Bloomberg]\nThe post Google & Nvidia reportedly express concern over Microsoft/Activision purchase appeared first on Destructoid.",

We'll have to see if that holds true after yet another price increase, because the cost of HBO Max has risen yet again.\nThe change went into effect today, January 12, making the service's former $14.99/month price for the ad-free tier has increased $1 to $15.99. It's the first price hike since the launch of HBO Max back in March of 2020.\nhttps://twitter.com/hbomax/status/1613672303090335746\nWhile it's impossible to know for sure why the company decided to raise the price, there's a chance that they're simply keeping up with the rising costs of inflation, especially after their competitors like Netflix have done the same. Of course, it does seem a bit convenient that this change is happening only days before the premiere of The Last of Us TV adaptation on HBO Max, which will likely be one of the biggest streaming events of the year.\nThe show has been receiving rave reviews from critics, and as a fan of the series myself, I'll be interested to see how they translate such a beloved game to a live action television format.

From the tightly-focused stories of its early days to its sprawling open world adventures in recent years, there's something in there for everybody. Long time fans of the games, though, have requested that the series take a step back and make a return to its older games, and this time, Ubisoft has taken fans' requests to heart.\nIn an interview with GamesRadar+, Assassin's Creed creative director Stéphane Boudon confirmed that while the series' sprawling titles like Odyssey and Valhalla are \"great games with the promise to live an epic journey in a strong fantasy,\" they will be pivoting to place a greater focus on \"character-driven story\" and \"the core pillars of the first ACs in a more intimate scale.\" This is music to my ears as a fan of shorter single player experiences, so I'll be excited to check out a new Assassin's Creed title that presents a more streamlined experience.\nhttps://twitter.com/assassinscreed/status/1568690133666340864\nUbisoft announced that Assassin's Creed: Mirage would be the next entry in the series last September, and soon after revealed that the game would follow Basim from Assassin’s Creed Valhalla. The story will follow his coming-of-age in the backdrop of ninth century Baghdad.\nAs much as I love hearing that Assassin's Creed is going back to its roots, part of me wonders if scaling back was a necessity first. Ubisoft's release lineup has already been hit by another wave of cancellations and delays, so cutting back to a smaller scale for the AC series would help relive some of the pressure on the development team. Whether it was a survival move or a creative on, I think it's a smart move -- players have been asking for more narrative-heavy AC games for years now.\nThe post Ubisoft says Assassin’s Creed: Mirage will be returning to the series’ roots appeared first on Destructoid.",

The purchasable costume has been conspicuous by its absence since January 2020, notably the same timeframe that saw the growing status of the global COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs noted by Eurogamer, the \"Scourge\" and \"Plague\" skins have made frequent appearances in Fortnite's rotational shop since their 2018 debut, available to purchase for 1500 V-Bucks each. But both outfits have been missing for two years, finally making a reappearance in-store earlier this week. The skins depict the frightening, beaked \"plague doctors\" of the 16th century, who would fill the beaked masks with herbal remedies in an effort to stave off infection as they visited the slums of working-class patients.\nWhile Epic Games never made any open statement as to the reasoning behind the costume's removal, it's not hard to imagine that somebody might have thought it a wise and prudent move to not fill the world's most popular video game with Plague Doctors during a period of global sickness.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is, of course, very much still with us, but enough time has passed that many companies and communities are readjusting to a \"Post-COVID\" status, though it should be clearly noted that the coronavirus and its variants are still infecting hundreds of thousands of people on a daily basis.

          "description": "Final Fantasy XVI is due out June 22 exclusively on PlayStation 5, but some fans believe a PC version of the game could release as soon as six months after its console debut. However, FF16 producer Naoki Yoshida isn't sure why. \nDuring a recent Final Fantasy XIV stream, Yoshida, who is a director on that game, was asked about rumors surrounding a PC version of FF16, and he responded, \"I don't know where the notion of a PC version releasing six months after the game is out came from as none of us have ever said that,\" according to a translator, as reported by Eurogamer. He followed it up with two instances urging fans to buy the PS5 version. \nAccording to a translation by Siliconera, Yoshida also said, \"There's been talk that the PC version will come out, but no one on the team has said anything about the PC version. I wonder why people assume the PC version will arrive six months after [the PS5 version], so just go ahead and buy a PS5.\" \nThe talk of a PC version of the game stems from a promotional PlayStation 5 video released last year that says in small print that FF16 will be a \"PS5 exclusive for six months.\" Some extrapolated from this small print that a PC release of the game will come after that six months of exclusivity is up, but if Yoshida's recent comments are any indication, the team has nothing to say in regards to a PC version. \nFinal Fantasy XVI hits PlayStation 5 on June 22. While waiting for more information, watch this \"Ambition\" trailer that reveals more about Valisthea's kingdoms, dominants, and eikons, and then check out our interview with Yoshida about the game's boss fights. \n[Source: Eurogamer]\nAre you picking up Final Fantasy XVI on PS5 or waiting for the rumored PC release?

I think of games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild when someone brings up weapon durability, as it was a hotly debated aspect of its release (I didn't mind it at all, personally). \nLove it or hate it, weapon durability is a feature that will likely never go away in games, and that's okay because when it's done right, it can be a helpful way to push players toward something new. In 2011's Dead Island, weapon durability was a big part of the experience, and that feature will return in Dead Island 2 when it hits PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and PC, on April 2…",

          "description": "Don't expect The Last of Us HBO show to extend beyond the story of the two games in the series. That's because The Last of Us game director Neil Druckmann says there are no plans for stories beyond the games in this show.\nThis news comes by way of a new interview with Druckmann from The Hollywood Reporter, as reported by GameSpot. Here's what Druckmann told THR specifically: \"We have no plans to tell any stories beyond adapting the games. We won't run into the same issue as Game of Thrones since The Last of Us Part: II doesn't end on a cliffhanger.\" \n\n\nDruckmann and TV series writer Craig Mazin have mentioned that a second season of this show might cover the events of The Last of Us Part II (personally, I think The Last of Us Part II could cover two seasons of television). Despite the duo not wanting the show to go beyond the games, there might be a way for the show to cover more ground after the events of The Last of Us Part II. If Naughty Dog were to develop a theoretical The Last of Us Part III, it wouldn't be surprising if the HBO show covered that down the road. Chances seem pretty good considering Druckmann told THR that there is \"more story to tell\" in the world of The Last of Us games. \nMazin also touched on his desire not to extend the show beyond the games in the THR interview, as noted by GameSpot, stating that he doesn't \"have any interest in a spinning-plates-go-on-forever show.\" \n\"When it becomes a perpetual motion machine, it just can't help but get kind of...stupid,\" he continued. \"Endings mean everything to me.\" \nFor more about The Last of Us on HBO, read our interview with Joel actor Pedro Pascal and Druckmann about the changes made for this TV show. Check out this new piece of concept art from The Last of Us multiplayer game that Naughty Dog is currently developing after that. \n[Source: GameSpot via The Hollywood Reporter]\nWhat scene are you most excited to see in The Last of Us on HBO?

This side-scrolling action title boasts plenty of satisfying action thanks to Kai’s fun melee combat, nimble platforming abilities, and his signature grappling hook, which he uses to traverse levels as well as yank and toss enemies. Sporting great 16-bit art and a strong soundtrack, Gravity Circuit is worth keeping an eye on for fans of classic throwbacks. \nJoin editors Wesley LeBlanc and Marcus Stewart as they explore Gravity Circuit’s free Steam demo and discuss why it may be one of the year’s most exciting indie gems.\n\n\nFor more previews of some of the biggest games of 2022 and beyond, be sure to head over to our YouTube page for NGTs about Fire Emblem Engage, Clive 'N' Wrench, Inkulinati, Outer Terror, and more.",

The eerie title eschewed the more bombastic horror of its main rival at the time, Resident Evil, in favor of more psychological frights.

That story is about the GT Academy contest, which was a real contest held between 2008 and 2016 by Sony and Nissan. Winners were given entrance into Nissan's Driver Development Program, as noted by Video Games Chronicle. The film appears to be telling the tale of someone who won entrance into this program and then went on to become a real success in the racing world. \nCheck out the Gran Turismo sneak peek for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, this sneak peek is a mix of what appears to be movie footage and behind-the-scenes footage, with stars like Harbour, Barnet, and Bloom talking about their excitement for the film. \nGran Turismo hits theaters later this year on August 11. \nAlongside this sneak peek, Sony also revealed that Gran Turismo 7, the latest in the long-running series released last year, will be getting an update that makes the game playable on its upcoming PSVR2 platform. \nWhile waiting to learn more about this Gran Turismo movie, read about Project Leonardo, a new customizable accessibility controller kit PlayStation unveiled yesterday and then read about how the PlayStation 5 has surpassed 30 million units sold. \nAre you excited about this Gran Turismo movie?

          "description": "The Last of Us turns 10 years old in June, and Naughty Dog plans to celebrate the milestone with an array of special announcements along the way. One of those updates involves a closer look at the upcoming standalone multiplayer title.\nIn a blog post, Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann reflects on The Last of Us’ legacy as well as the franchise’s future. In addition to the HBO adaptation premiering on January 15 and the PC port of The Last of Us Part 1 hitting in March, Druckmann states fans will learn more about the long-awaited multiplayer experience that serves as a follow-up to the original game’s Factions mode. Druckmann writes,\n“We’ll have some fun surprises for you along the way, but later this year we will begin to offer you some details on our ambitious The Last of Us multiplayer game. With a team led by Vinit Agarwal, Joe Pettinati, and Anthony Newman, the project is shaping up to be a fresh, new experience from our studio, but one rooted in Naughty Dog’s passion for delivering incredible stories, characters, and gameplay.”\nNaughty Dog also shares a new piece of concept art, posted in full below, which is the first new material of the game since it released the first concept asset last June. It depicts two survivors heading toward a dilapidated cruise ship. \nThough we’ll be learning more about the game this year, it’s still unknown if Naughty Dog plans to launch it in 2023. That would be fitting given the anniversary, but we'll have to wait and see over the coming months. Until then, be sure to check out this feature on how The Last of Us Part 1 proves there's no such thing as a faithful remake.",

News of this change follows the release of Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance's release last year, which didn't fare too well with critics and players, amidst Larian Studios' continued development on Baldur's Gate 3 (which does not seem to be affected by this reorganization despite WotC serving as the game's publisher). \nThese two games, in part, represented WotC's bigger forray into the video game space as Bloomberg reports that the company had signed contracts with several studios to make games. WotC also \"built at least six of its own game studios,\" according to the publication. \nOne project in the works that is now canceled went under the codename \"Jabberwocky,\" according to Bloomberg, and two more externally developed games early in development are no longer moving forward as well. These cancelations and layoffs comes as parent company Hasbro's shares fell 40% last year. \nWotc told IGN that it remains \"committed to using digital games as a cornerstone of our strategy for bringing our games to players around the world,\" adding that it has \"made some changes to our long-term portfolio to focus on games which are strategically aligned with developing our existing brands and those which show promise in expanding or engaging our audience in new ways.\" \n[Source: Bloomberg]",

In addition to showing off some new gameplay clips, it announces that the game will use NVIDIA DLSS3 technology, which a press release says will \"massively boost performance.\" You can watch the trailer below.\n\n\nAnnounced by NVIDIA last September, DLSS 3 can boost a game's performance by a significant margin. One demo on NVIDIA's site shows two instances of Cyberpunk 2077 running at 96 FPS with ray tracing still enabled. \"DLSS 3 allows the seemingly impossible, high framerate without compromising the visuals,\" Adrian Chmielarz, creative director and co-founder of The Astronauts says in a press release. \"A no brainer for a game like Witchfire, which is both action and beauty.\"\nWitchfire is a dark fantasy first-person shooter from the creators of Painkiller, Bulletstorm, and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. Set in an alternate reality, players are caught in the middle of a war between witches and the Church, and must use weapons and powers from Vatican sorcerers to defeat their enemies. \nThe game is set to enter Early Access in the Epic Games Store sometime later this year, though that wasn't always the case. It was delayed last October because the team decided to overhaul the world's design and make it more open. This trailer is a good indication that the studio is still hard at work, though; here's hoping that \"early 2023\" ends up being as soon as possible.",

According to a Twitter thread posted to the official Cult of the Lamb account, this update will introduce features many players have requested, including accessibility improvements, quality-of-life features, new difficulty options, and more depth.\nThis Major Content Update will release in 2023 and be FREE to all players!\npic.twitter.com/FWFW7sC7F0\nDecember 30, 2022\nThe biggest change they showcase in this thread is the introduction of heavy attacks, which can be activated by holding down the attack button. These are more than slow swings that do more damage; in Cult of the Lamb, every heavy attack has a unique effect. For example, the sword's heavy attack smashes the ground, doing an explosion of damage that harms any enemy caught in its range. Meanwhile, the dagger creates a line of knives that fall from the sky, and the axe can be thrown around like a boomerang. This is just the tip of the iceberg; developer Massive Monster says it's \"just one small tidbit\" of what's still to come.\nThe update should come soon, but not that soon. The last tweet of the thread clarifies that the developers are currently working on a patch to fix some console bugs and that the major update won't be released until after that. Their release window also isn't any more specific than \"2023,\" so it could come out any time this year.\nIf you're interested in learning more about the game, you can check out our review.\nWould a major update bring you back for more Cult of the Lamb?

Current Hitman 3 owners will get a free upgrade to Hitman World of Assassination on all platforms.\"\n\"We're drastically simplifying the purchase experience for new players. Hitman World of Assassination will be the single experience option to start playing.\" \n\n\nThis update makes it so that all Hitman 3 owners will have the same base content ownership, and it attempts to eliminate confusion over which edition to buy to obtain certain levels by making it so that there is only one purchase option. The other DLC will apparently still be available for purchase, but owning all the IO Interactive Hitman trilogy levels will be easier than ever now. \nHitman World of Assassination will cost $70, and it includes Hitman 3, the Hitman 1 Game of the Year Access Pass, and the Hitman 2 Standard Access Pass. You can also purchase the Hitman World of Assassination Deluxe Pack for $30 to get the Hitman 3 Deluxe Pack, the Hitman 3 Seven Deadly Sins Collection, and the Hitman 2 Expansion Access Pass. \n\"Those are the only two products that new players need to consider when buying any Hitman game digitially as of January 26, 2023,\" IO writes in a blog post. \"The changes have also been made with the Freelancer game mode in mind, where being able to easily access all locations from across the World of Assassination is parmount to maximizing your enjoyment.\" \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's Hitman 3 review and then read about the new Hitman 3 Freelancer mode.\nHave you played this Hitman trilogy?

Publisher Deep Silver released some spinoffs after Riptide, like Escape Dead Island, Dead Island: Epidemic, and the 16-bit beat ‘em up Dead Island Retro Revenge, but a full-scale, numbered sequel hasn’t yet happened, despite being announced nearly a decade ago. \nThe first iteration of Dead Island 2 was helmed by Spec Ops: The Line developer Yager, as Dead Island developer Techland had parted ways with the property and worked on Dying Light.

The user didn't provide many details about the potential special edition Switch, but as you can see in the images below, the photos are quite believable. There are pictures of the console, the packaging, the Joy-Con, and more.\nCheck out the possible leaked images of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Switch OLED special edition for yourself below: \nAlleged photos of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom themed Switch OLED.

However, elaborate and well-done fakes have been done before so there's no telling if this is actually real until we learn more information. It wouldn't be the most surprising thing ever, considering Nintendo tends to release special edition OLED models for big releases like this year's Splatoon 3 and Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. \nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom hits Switch on May 12 so it might be a while before we learn if this special edition OLED model is real.

Longtime MGS producer Noriaki Okamura wrote in a recent issue of Famitsu that \"2023 will be a year of many announcements,\" as reported by Gematsu. \nIn this special end-of-the-year issue of Famitsu, multiple Japanese developers and producers wrote quick teases about what 2023 might hold for them. It's here where Okamura teased that 2023 will be a year of announcements for Konami Digital Entertainment. More specifically, he said \"Other than [the educational edition of Momotaro Dentetsu announced last year], 2023 will be a year of many announcements,\" and that his keyword for 2023 is \"long-awaited,\" as noted by Gematsu. \nNow, this could just be his way of saying that Konami, as a whole, will make some announcements and that maybe some of them will be long-awaited by fans. However, given that it's Okamura – a longtime MGS producer – saying this, there's reason to believe that maybe he's teasing a return to the MGS series. Perhaps we're getting a remake of one of the games, or maybe a new mainline entry. Only time will tell. \nIn the meantime, read Game Informer's ranking of the Metal Gear Solid series. \n[Source: Gematsu]\nHow do you want to see the Metal Gear Solid series return?
