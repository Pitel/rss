The firm's latest announcement is tangentially related to Switch 2, and it comes as a big disappointment to many: Nintendo is scrapping its Gold Points scheme.\nOriginally launched in March 2016 as part of My Nintendo, a replacement for Club Nintendo, you won't earn Gold Points on any eShop purchases after 24th March 2025. This means that anyone buying Switch 1 games on the upcoming successor won't benefit from the loyalty system.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

It’s true that teams were able to turn projects around much more quickly in those days, as evidenced by franchises such as Resident Evil and Final Fantasy, but it was also a clear indication of just how popular Lara Croft had become, and how much publisher Eidos Interactive wanted to milk the series to within an inch of its life.\nThe story goes that Core Design had grown weary of Tomb Raider by the time it commenced work on the fourth entry, The Last Revelation. Though keen to wean off Lara Croft and be done with the series, the team was ordered by Eidos to press on with even more Tomb Raider games. So while one group of devs reworked scrapped ideas from The Last Revelation to produce Tomb Raider: Chronicles, another moved development to the PS2 and began work on The Angel of Darkness.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

While the full effect of this increase is yet to be seen, it poses a potential price hike for consoles and accessories developed in China, which, naturally, is a cause for concern to both consumers and developers.\nAcknowledging this, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa has said that the company is looking into the potential impact that the tariffs could have on the upcoming financial year and the launch of the Switch 2.

          "description": "Not Abyssmal.\nDuring Sony’s February 2025 State of Play presentation, the big shadow drop was Koei Tecmo’s Warriors: Abyss, which offers a low-budget, roguelite take on the popular Warriors hack ‘n’ slash formula. The good news is that this genre hybrid feels like both halves fit perfectly together—the mindlessness of the combat mixed with the brief run-focused nature of roguelite action is so good that it almost feels hard to believe that the team never thought to produce something like this earlier. The bad news is that its struggles with repetition keep it from being anywhere near as addictive as roguelikes such as Dead Cells or Slay the Spire. Luckily, Warriors: Abyss still proves itself to be a worthwhile new entry in the series, but only just.\nWarriors: Abyss begins with you being summoned by an impish little god named Enma, the king of Hell, who was recently deposed when an ancient evil being named Gouma was released and took over the land of the dead. Eager to reclaim his throne, Enma enlists the stars of the Warriors franchise to fight off Gouma’s forces and ultimately send the creature back where it came from. Every now and then, Enma will pop up with a bit more of lore or some snarky quip, but there’s not much more to the storyline beyond this basic setup.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Get inspired again, y'know? Just as the high seas are the refuge of displaced Yakuza or insolvent scoundrels in this minigame-stuffed brawler-RPG, the game feels like the last port of call for a studio scraping the bottom of the grog barrel.\nI smiled a lot, mind. It's hard not to with Majima back; moisturised, flourishing, driving a six-inch tanto knife into a man's kidneys for being mildly rude to him on the beach, and abducting monkeys for his petting zoo. He's also the captain of a pirate ship now, having woken on a strange island with no memory of his Yakuza past, but the same sense of fair play and manic flair for theatrical shankings. Plus, he's already got the eyepatch sorted.\nWhy are there actual, cannon-wielding, tricorn-headed pirates off the coast of Hawaii? Shhh. Just get on the boat. You do find the idea of a Majima being a pirate entertaining enough on its own to last you twenty five hours, don't you?

It might just be that this logic puzzler sticks its thumb out noticeably from the omnipresent gaggle of post-roguelite survivalyptic soulsbuilder decklikes, but I suspect it's also down to the deeply satisfying bloopy twinkle that plays whenever you drop someone into a seat with your floating hand cursor.\nYou've got a limited number of seats and a bunch of jolly demand-os, and it's your job to make them all happy. \"I want to sit with Bob\". \"I need a window seat\". \"I forgot to shower\". \"I do not like bad smells\". So you quarantine the nostril bombers in the back of your limo, make sure everyone else is happy, and drive off to the next level. There, you'll take the role of a cinema usher. Some punters want to sit next to someone with popcorn so they can steal it, and some want to wear massive cowboy hats that block those behind them. It's all quite simple, but robust, and just thoughtful enough to lightly tickle your synapses, like a gentle grizzly bear wielding an illustrious peacock feather.\nRead more",

I do miss fighting against large enemy empires though, something the AI seems more reluctant to pull off these days. Creative Assembly seem to think so, too.

(Maybe not so much the last two.) This saw you choosing methods of gaining NPC affection from a disc with quadrants labelled \"Admire\", \"Joke\", \"Coerce\" and \"Boast\", each of which elicits a different response previewed by the NPC's gurnishly changing expression. \nYou have to choose all four options at least once per round, and the underlying \"pie\" rotates every time you pick one. The underlying segments are partially filled in to show how much they'll affect the NPC's opinion, for better or worse. The idea, then is to match responses that have a positive effect to the largest chunks of pie, by picking them in the right order. If you think all that sounds incredibly overwrought and laborious, then you are clearly not one of the hosts of Wheeljam 2025, a gamedev community knockabout dedicated to Bethesda's ole Tart Of Cajolement.

          "description": "There's something uncanny about dipping \"classic\" games in a tub of HD paint for the purposes of a remaster. A reboot can completely reinvent an old character, intriguing players in the same way an adaptation of Macbeth might excite a theatre dweeb. But remasters often feel like someone has plainly yet painstakingly rolled over every inch of the original with linoleum. The worst remasters bring to mind the Spanish pensioner who butchered a fresco of Jesus Christ. As acts of restoration go, Aspyr's work on Tomb Raider (and Soul Reaver) isn't quite that egregious. Hard work has gone into updating the scenery and textures. Basic vine sprites become handsome twirls of plantlife. Egyptian reliefs are given form. But there's a limit to this unfurling of digital lino. The results ultimately evoke the look common in mobile games when smartphones were becoming ever more powerful. This is Lara Croft if she were designed by Gameloft in 2011.\nRead more",

We've all played it, and we all have mildly different opinions on it - the stuff that thrilling conversations are made of. Onward!\nNic: James did you work out how to freeze things yet?\nJames: I’ll explain this quickly so Nic can get on to complaining about Avowed having the wrong kinds of boxes. But yes, I did get stuck on an early main quest that required me to use ice magic to create frozen platforms for crossing water, an otherwise neat little systems thingy that had not been communicated or hinted at before that point, but was communicated and hinted at during the following main quest.\nOtherwise, I’m having an okayish time? It doesn’t have the Skyrim-tier expansiveness I always hope for with these kinds of games, but its world is a pretty one, and it’s got some quality close-quarters mageing.\nNic: Look. I feel passionately about those crates. There are two types of crates. You can only smash the crates that have the special 'smash me' icon on them. I don't want a crate to \"come hither\" me. Takes all the fun out of the petty vandalism.\nIt's funny though because those two qualities you mention, James - the world and magic - are the same ones I thought were Avowed's strongest elements.

I'd run through all the ways Obsidian's latest didn't quite do it for me, most of you would go play it anyway because it's on Games Pass, and we'd all go back to patiently waiting for the sun to explode.\nBut, god, what a devastatingly gorgeous open-zoned world this is. What a triumphantly weird, sprawling playground of fantasy naturalia. What a treat it is to just climb all over, its design ethos captured in the first magical ring I found offering a 15% buff to parkour speed.\nIgnore two thirds of the weapons and just roll a wizard to witness the stodgy melee combat of other classes give way to crackling, cackling spell-slinging. There is such a gulf of quality here it's like playing two different games. I spent 27 hours having a meh ol' time until a reinstallation of Nvidia's loathsome app deleted 200 some screenshots and I had to restart. Why not play a wizard? I thought. Why not indeed.

Kotick made the comments during an appearance on Grit, a business podcast by American venture capital company Kleiner Perkins. He appeared on the podcast with former EA CEO Bing Gordon (thanks, Gamespot), to talk about both their company histories.\nKotick's statements reference widely reported incidents alleging a company culture of harassment, intimidation, and pay inequity around the time - coinciding with a lawsuit against the company - and the petition referred to appears to be this one to remove him as CEO, which attracted over a thousand signatures.\nThat petition followed a report by the Wall Street Journal (paywalled) that highlighted several alleged incidents of harassment by Activision staff, alongside reports that Kotick was aware of these allegations but did not inform the company's board of directors, and intervened to prevent the firing of an alleged harasser. It wasn't just Activision workers who found these claims alarming: a group of company shareholders called for Kotick's resignation soon after. Kotick denied any wrongdoing.\nRead more",

There’s also a standalone benchmark tool that you can download from the game’s Steam page, so you can see for yourself how the beast-biffing RPG will run on your hardware.\nIn theory, these are great developments. Lower requirements mean a more widely accessible game, and the benchmark tool – which covers a good six minutes of combined cinematics and simulated free roaming – brings reassurance and accountability to this otherwise hype-reliant prerelease period. Sadly, there are two problems. One, the benchmark confirms outright that Monster Hunter Wilds will run like stagnant goulash on low-end PCs, and two, it does so to the extent that I’m not sure that the revised minimum specs are even reliable.\nRead more",

Summarised as a \"slice of life tamagotchi\" and available in Spanish and English, it's a gamejam production from Francisco Riolobos, Chuso Montero and Deconstructeam, the Valencia-based developers behind The Red String Club and The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood.\nIt's free to download from Itch.io, and takes the form of a snowglobe perspective of somebody's one-room apartment. The person in question has just left their job after a rough spell, and has impulsively bought a guitar. They are also, however, totally exhausted, with barely the willpower to do anything beyond getting out of bed, let alone make music. Your task is to help them through each day and rebuild their morale till they feel able to pluck a few chords.\n Read more",

Developers Bugbear say they have \"overhauled its physics engine to deliver the most intense crashes, deeper component damage, and absolute vehicular mayhem.\" We can see a little bit of that in a new trailer below, which also gives us an exact early access release date.\nRead more",

Also, a relatively bug-free one. \r\n\n\r\nIn the course of my 51 hours as reviewer, I've encountered only a smattering of more significant technical issues. Firstly, some heavy slowdown while roaming Trosky Castle, the centerpiece of the opening Bohemian Paradise region, which I resolved by quitting and reloading. Secondly, a mildly terrifying moment in a dugout when a wounded soldier I was supposed to be treating struck a T-pose, as though afflicted by lightning early onset arthritis. And thirdly a repeated crash bug which I feel warrants its own article given that, together with Deliverance 2's eccentric saving system, it cost me several hours of progress.\r\n \nRead more",

The crash, which grounded the plane by damaging its left wing, occurred after Akemann ignored temporary drone restrictions in order to survey the Palisades fires before losing control. Thanks, Eurogamer. For first noticing the case, I mean. I'm not blaming Eurogamer for the drone crash. Not this one, anyway.\nThe drone was traced back to Akemann, who has agreed to plead guilty to one count of unsafe operation of an unmanned aircraft. That's a misdemeanour that usually carries up to one year prison time, but he's \"hoping to escape the prison term in exchange for 150 hours of community service in support of wildfire relief and the approximately $65,000 USD it cost to repair the plane,\" write Eurogamer, as part of a plea agreement.\nRead more",

          "description": "Now that we know more about how Elden Ring Nightreign actually plays after its recent network test, you're probably starting to coordinate friend groups to play the co-op title on release. You're probably wondering, does Elden Ring Nightreign have crossplay so you can play with friends on other platforms? Let's take a look.\n\n\nScreenshot by Bandai Namco\n\n\nIs there crossplay in Elden Ring Nightreign?\n\n\nUnfortunately, FromSoftware has confirmed that there will be no crossplay support across platforms. There will be support for generational crossplay between platforms, which means PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 players can play together, as can Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S players. However, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S players won't be able to play together, and PC players will only be able to play with other PC players.\n\n\nThis means if you want to play with friends, you will all need to be on the same platform. On the plus side, Elden Ring Nightreign appears to be following the same release plans as Shadow of the Erdtree which means it will be released globally on all platforms at the same time. If you and your friends all agree on the same platform to play on, you shouldn't have any issues playing together come release.\n\n\nIs there PC cross-platform support?\n\n\nAt the moment it appears Elden Ring Nightreign will only be available on Steam when it comes to PC. As such, there will not be PC cross-platform support because it is only available on one PC platform: Steam. This is to be expected as the base Elden Ring game and Shadow of the Erdtree DLC are both only on Steam as well, most likely due to the multiplayer features of the game utilizing Steamworks and Steam servers.\n\n\nIt's important to note that based on this logic, matchmaking in Elden Ring Nightreign will platform-specific as well, meaning PC players will not be matchmade with console players and vice versa.\n\n\n\nThe post Does Elden Ring Nightreign have crossplay? appeared first on Destructoid.",

He endured a lot during his short and tumultuous 40-year life and used his experiences to create dark tales and lyrical poetry that secured his place in literary history. \n\n\nBoston-born Poe has a host of “firsts” to his name, among which is the remarkable claim that he was the first well-known American author to have made his entire living solely from writing. He made early contributions to both the science fiction and detective fiction genres but is most well known for his macabre short stories and poems. \n\n\nPoe has quite an extensive bibliography.

          "description": "Wizards Of The Coast's official Twitter account just revealed Summons will work as Enchantment Creature Sagas on the upcoming MTG x Final Fantasy crossover set.\n\n\nOne of the biggest questions regarding the upcoming set was the workings of summons, which could've appeared as various things, such as creatures or sorcery spells, but it turns out they're another thing entirely.\n\n\n\n\nThey’re Enchantment Creature Sagas, a specific type of pre-existing MTG enchantment that’s not permanent but holds immense power. Saga cards tend to feature three effects that will trigger effects in each of the three turns after their summoning and then vanish.\n\n\nThe Final Fantasy X version of Shiva, the one that'll feature on this collab, will tap an enemy creature of your choice for the first two turns, then unleash Diamond Dust, her famous Overdrive that will have her owner draw a card for each tapped creature their opponents control. Being an Enchantment Creature Saga means that on top of her saga abilities, Shiva also behaves as a regular creature for three turns before automatically going to the graveyard.\n\n\nSo, instead of working like Sorceries or Instant Magics, akin to how they behave in most of the games in the Final Fantasy series, the Summons from the MTG Final Fantasy set will behave more similarly to the Summons from Final Fantasy X. They'll stay in the game for a while, and not just show up for an attack before vanishing.\n\n\nPopular trading card game Magic: The Gathering has been experimenting with several fantasy-themed collaborations via its Universes Beyond endeavor over the past few years. We've previously seen Dungeons & Dragons and Lord Of The Rings-inspired crossovers, and while those were pretty cool, I doubt hardly anything could ever beat the upcoming Final Fantasy x MTG crossover in terms of gamer hype.\n\n\nMagic The Gathering X Final Fantasy releases on June 13.\n\nThe post How will Final Fantasy summons work on MTG? appeared first on Destructoid.",

Hollow Knight: Silksong has returned to the US Nintendo eShop with a TBD release date.\n\n\nI'm not a doomsayer, and I'm sure there is a perfectly reasonable explanation, but it appears as though the listing for Hollow Knight: Silksong on the US Nintendo eShop has been removed. Instead of displaying information about the upcoming game, there's simply an image of Wario along with the message \"Whoops!

Hollow Knight: Silksong still has a listing on the EU eShop, as well as other platforms like Xbox Live, Steam, and the PlayStation Store. For further assurance, the Hollow Knight: SilkSong website still has the Nintendo Switch logo listed for platforms.\n\n\nAs I said, I'm sure there is a perfectly reasonable explanation for this. Maybe something to do with the Nintendo Switch 2, right? Maybe becoming a launch title? Maybe someone just accidentally moved the listing to the wrong castle. Or, maybe the scope of Silksong has grown too much to where it's going to be rebranded as Hollow Knight 2? All speculation at this point and the actual importance of it disappearing from the eShop could be nothing or everything. Only time will tell.\n\n\nI've personally forced myself to move Hollow Knight: Silksong to the back of my brain, at least until we get something new. There are a ton of great games coming out this year, I can't keep telling myself at every conference or event that surely this is when we're going to get an update on Silksong. I just can't keep doing it, it's not healthy.\n\n\nAnyway, at this point, Hollow Knight: Silksong as we know it is expected to release some day on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.\n\n\n\nThe post [UPDATE] Don’t panic, but Hollow Knight: Silksong has vanished from the US Nintendo eShop appeared first on Destructoid.",

Atari is bringing the sim to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S on March 20, 2025.\n\n\nThe Complete Edition previously made its way to PC and Nintendo Switch in September 2020. Turning back the clock even further, the original Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 celebrated its 20th anniversary last year. That certainly lands it firmly in the \"nostalgic\" camp for some at this point, and you can stoke those rose-tinted fires with the announcement trailer below.\n\n\n\n\nAs its title suggests, RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 Complete Edition includes the third entry in full HD along with the content from the expansion packs. The Soaked! expansion is all about water parks and the Wild! expansion has you throwing animal habitats into the mix. The full package here seems right in line with previous versions, so don't go into the PlayStation and Xbox ports looking for anything new. \n\n\nThe rest is more or less just how we all remember it. You'll be tasked with managing everything from staff to shops as you attempt to grow your theme park. Or, if you just feel like going wild, you can hit up sandbox mode and build the park of your dreams without worrying about a ballooning budget.\n\n\nWhen Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 Complete Edition launches on PlayStation and Xbox next month, you can strap in for a one-time entry fee of $29.99. There's also a 20 percent discount in place for those who preorder.\n\nThe post RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 Complete Edition finally has a date with PlayStation and Xbox appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Throughout Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, you'll sometimes have to get your hands dirty while keeping to the shadows, which is where stealth killing comes into play. Here is how to perform a Stealth Kill in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHow to Stealth Kill successfully\n\n\nIn order to perform a Stealth Kill in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, you need to have a Dagger equipped. You can find them scattered throughout Bohemia, or you can craft one at the Blacksmith or purchase one from a merchant. Unlike most other weapons in KCD2, you can't actually engage in combat with a Dagger. Instead, it simply gives you the option to perform a Stealth Kill.\n\n\nOnce you have a Dagger equipped, you then want to enter your crouched/stealth mode by hitting 'C' key by default on PC. When hiding, you are harder to see by enemies and this allows you to sneak up on your target to perform a Stealth Kill.\n\n\nNext, walk close behind your target, and when you get close enough, you will see the prompts in the bottom right corner of the screen to execute a Stealth Kill. By default on PC, you need to hold the 'F' key to carry out the Stealth Kill. Simply tapping the 'F' key instead of holding it will perform a Knock Out, which won't kill your target but rather disable them quietly for a short duration.\n\n\nSometimes when executing a Stealth Kill, your target will attempt to fight back. When this happens you will see indicators in the middle of your screen, similar to the counterattack and block indicators when engaged in Melee Combat. If you see the green Block indicator, you must right click, whereas if it's the blue counter-attack indicator, you must left-click. If you fail either of these checks the enemy will stop you from executing the Stealth Kill as well as alert others in the area to come and help them.\n\nThe post How to Stealth Kill in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "One of the reasons why many cheat in online video games is that there's usually little repercussion. You get one account banned, sure, but you can just come up with another one. Morgan \"RepulseGod\" Bamford wasn't so lucky.\n\n\nBack in 2023, Morgan shared his account with another player, nicknamed Forbes, who'd go on to earn a pretty neat cash prize. Unfortunately for him, however, he was caught and disqualified, but that was still not enough to quench Epic Games' thirst for justice.\n\n\nAs spotted by Kotaku, Epic's retaliation for his attempt to qualify for the Fortnite Championship Series Grand Finals in 2023 ended with a lawsuit that forced Bamford to post a video admission of guilt on his own YouTube channel. Though the video is only 20 seconds long — perhaps the minimum length permitted by the lawsuit — it remains incredibly painful to watch.\n\n\n\n\nBamford wrote, “Cheating in tournaments ruins the fun for the players who earned their spot in tournaments, and I apologize to the Fortnite community for my actions,” which reads like something Epic PR had written for him.\n\n\nBamford concluded by saying he'd never cheat in Fortnite again, to which one user responded with, \"No sh*t bruh you banned lmfao,\" with others voicing similar sentiments (and the same level of eloquence).\n\n\nOn top of the public humiliation, Bamford had to pay a monetary settlement, which included the prize money he'd won through his twisted alliance with Forbes. Epic will donate the money to the Child's Play charity. We don't know the exact amount Bamford had to pay for the settlement, but his Fortnite series placement had earned him $10,000.\n\nThe post Epic Games forces Fortnite cheater to publicly admit to his misdeeds. appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Much like the real world, BitLife's jobs vary in complexity, requirements, and pay ranges. Some jobs pay hundreds of thousands of dollars but require nearly a decade of post-secondary schooling, while others are accessible as soon as your character turns 18. \n\n\nThere are many reasons for picking up a specific job, from wanting to make a lot of money to completing particular weekly challenges. Becoming a baker in BitLife for achievements and challenges may seem difficult initially, but it's surprisingly easy once you know what to look for.\n\n\nHow to become a baker in BitLife\n\n\nUnlike advanced jobs in BitLife that require special career packs or university degrees, the baker job only requires a clean criminal record. You don't even need to finish high school, but having a secondary school diploma will help if you pursue other jobs later. You'll find the baker role under Occupation and Jobs.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHowever, you're not guaranteed to see it immediately, especially if your character graduated from university. Completing a university program causes BitLife to filter through jobs related to your degree to make it easier to pursue particular career types. If your character starts right from high school, you'll have more varied job options, raising your odds of seeing a baker position open.\n\n\nYou'll know you've found a baker job when you scroll near the bottom of the list and see \"Baker\" with a croissant emoji next to its name. From here, you just need to apply for the position and pass the interview to officially land the job and knock out any related achievements, scavenger hunts, or challenge objectives. In particular, you can knock out the Master Baker candy heart of BitLife's 2025 Valentine's Day scavenger hunt or wait for future challenges that require this job.\n\nThe post How to become a baker in BitLife appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "God of Thunder, the Zelda-esque game, is now ready for public testing!\nPrepare yourself to take on the role of Thor, the god of thunder, as he battles his way through the three part game, facing enemies and challenging environmental puzzles, all to finally face down challenging end bosses, culminating in Loki himself.\nThe implementation in ScummVM is slightly different from the original, in that whilst it has a high score table like the original, you don't have to go through the steps of creating an account and being limited to only a single savegame. Also, unfortunately, the game uses a special music format that will need to be implemented from scratch by someone with experience. So for now, no music playback will occur, though in-game sound effects play back fine.\nTo participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. The game itself is freeware, and can be downloaded from the Adept Software website. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.And please take some screenshots along the way.\nHave you the skill to defeat Loki, or will you be defeated by the cunning enemies, or be stymied figuring out the puzzles. Play, and find out.\n>",
