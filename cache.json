The video game industry is lousy with sequels and remasters and reboots and rejigs, and despite its 'surprise and delight' MO, Nintendo is just as guilty of re-releasing past works as any other publisher.

Long before modern Indie Worlds and Nindie Showcases and games from small developers put out by billion-dollar publishers, indie games still felt very much independent. The original game — recently re-released in Remastered form — always stood out as one of the more notable titles from a small dev, especially on the Wii U eShop. Now, a decade later, we’re in a different landscape. With the surprise release of Teslagrad 2, the question then is whether Norwegian studio Rain Games is able to capture lightning in a bottle once more.\nTeslagrad 2 follows Lumina, a young girl who gets attacked by Vikings on her travels. She becomes stranded on Wyrmheim, a world heavily inspired by Scandinavia. Here she is tasked with harnessing and upgrading her electromagnetic powers to explore the world and find a way back home to her family.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The turn-based anime RPG did exactly that earlier this week, and it's already been downloaded over 20 million times in just a single day, according to a tweet from analyst Daniel Ahmad. Perhaps not surprising for a free-to-play game, but still. That's a lot of people. I must admit, I could never quite gel with Genshin Impact, another very anime RPG made by the same developers, but Honkai's turn-based battles look a lot more up my street. So I downloaded yesterday, which I guess makes me part of that enormous 20 million number. Are you planning on giving it a go as well? \nRead more",

          "description": "Valve revealed a swathe of new features coming to Steam's desktop client beta last night, and there are lots of new features that caught my eye. They're overhauling things like the in-game overlay, creating a new toolbar to house achievements, friends chat and discussions, and creating a new hub that shows you everything that's happened in the game's community since you last played it. It also introduces a cool pin feature that lets you stick overlay windows on top of your game - handy if you're following a guide, say, and don't want to keep alt-tabbing out. But there's one thing I'm quite upset about, and that's the new Notes app. I love a good notebook game, you know? Fiddling out puzzles in Tunic, remembering patterns in The Witness... Notebook games are great. But I fear this new Notes app will kill that kind of note-taking dead. And that makes me sad. \nRead more",

          "description": "When Firaxis first unveiled their new tactical superhero RPG Marvel's Midnight Suns in August of 2021, its card-based battle system proved to be a point of contention among its audience, so much so that when the game was delayed a short while later, rumours started flying that the studio was going back to the drawing board on the game's combat and dropping the cards entirely. \n\"Hah, that was wishful thinking for some people!\" laughs director Jake Solomon when I ask him at GDC how he felt about those rumours at the time. It's well-known now that the delay was simply about polishing the game rather than anything more drastic, but to Solomon's credit he does also concede that he was perhaps \"a little naïve\" at the time for thinking it would go down without question.\nRead more",

But I’ll be fair; it's definitely good.\nI've enjoyed most of my time with it, and the parts I didn't were probably down to caning it too hard in too short a time. Such is that reviewz lyf. Played less intensely over a longer period, I imagine more of its intricacies becoming clear, and more custom playstyles emerging to encourage more replays and challenges. As it stands though, its generally high quality and interesting systems just haven't captured my imagination.\nIt is not unimaginative, though. Some of its playable races are the usual elves and goblins, but most have a twist, like the cannibalistic dwarves, gold-obsessed necromancers, or the \"cursed toadlings\" I picked almost reflexively: a people transformed along with their warrior Queen Charming. Each comes with a starting hero and traits for their cities units, plus a set of spellbooks that determine what research you'll have access to upfront.\nRead more",

I see a flicker of anger in her eyes, as well as maybe, just maybe, a spark of interest.\r\n\n\r\nA new Dota patch came out last week, and it’s a biggun.

          "description": "When I meet Jake Solomon at GDC, it's his third day of unemployment. The XCOM and Marvel's Midnight Suns director and designer announced he was leaving Firaxis back in February, but his final day at the studio where he made his name and worked for more than twenty years was still very fresh in his memory. \"It's surreal,\" he says. \"For probably the next ten years, I'll refer to it as 'we' when we talk about Firaxis, and it's sad to think it's not the right pronoun anymore. It's exciting, but a little terrifying.\"\nOn the face of it, that panic might seem unfounded. Over the last decade, Solomon has become one of the most revered names in turn-based strategy games. Having cut his teeth on many of Sid Meier's Civilization games in his early years at Firaxis, he went on to become the designer who spearheaded the revival of XCOM with Enemy Unknown in 2012, before going on to direct its even more beloved sequel XCOM 2 and its War Of The Chosen expansion a few years later. Most recently, he was creative director on Marvel's Midnight Suns, which allowed him to marry his life-long love of Marvel comic books with the thrilling tactical combat he's so well known for. \nSolomon's next adventure, though, won't have the certainty of Midnight Suns' supercharged attack cards, or even the tease of an XCOM hit percentage backing him up. For not only is it Solomon's third day of unemployment when we speak; it's also the day after he revealed his plans to leave turn-based tactics games behind altogether. Instead, his sights are now set on the life simulation genre, a move that, at first glance, seems at odds with his career as a strategy designer. But over the course of our hour-long chat, it becomes increasingly clear that life sims have been a life-long obsession for Solomon, and he might have even made one by now had the development of XCOM 2 gone a little differently. \nRead more",

Sad times all round, I'm sure you'll agree, but what's it got to do with Betrayal At Club Low?\nWell, when I picked up Betrayal At Club Low for the RPS Game Club this month, I was transported back to my abortive run at Disco Elysium. It's not that I've never played a stat-check-heavy RPG before. Far from it. But somehow, each game's presentation resonated together in my weird brain mush. It must have been something to do with the combination of a surreal, seedy, not-quite-our-world-but-still-very-recognisable setting, and the constant presence of numbers reminding me of my character's strengths stacked up against their many, many weaknesses.\nRead more",

Ed enjoyed his two minutes of hands-on time last year, and with a pedigree this good, it’s probably worth checking out for fans of sleepy sports. \r\n\n \nRead more",

Modders can now add custom models, materials, textures, and more to Creative Assembly's horror shooter. To quickly demonstrate the new capabilities, the toolmaker has whipped up a small example: importing classic Counter-Strike map de_dust2 into Isolation. You can see the xenomorph stalking Dust2's sandy corridors in a fun little video below. I imagine modders are already planning bigger, more complex, and less silly uses for these new capababilities.\nRead more",

This woman is something of a mystery and seems to have a flair for the dramatic as she kicks off the whole game by playing an invisible violin along to the classic Baroque epic Pachelbel’s Canon as massive, intergalactic monsters invade a spaceship.\nIt’s an incredibly cool opening, the kind of thing that John Wick would watch to get pumped up before, well, John Wick-ing all over the place. It’s pretty clear that Kafka isn’t a hero, but they’ve woken you up, and since you’ve got no memories, you must be one of the good guys.

          "description": "I do love me a good farming sim, and I also love a good detective game, so imagine my brain exploding when I saw Grave Seasons for the first time, a farming murder mystery hybrid in the works by developer Son M and their studio Perfect Garbage. It's still very early in development (like there isn't even a Steam page for it yet), but it's still an incredible-sounding concept, as every time you start a new game, a random NPC will be selected to become a serial killer. You can grow crops, fish, raise cattle, and also help save your fellow townsfolk from a rampaging murderer. Cute!\nRead more",

          "description": "For all its flamingo thigh stews, misshapen clothes model characters and pizza-themed DJ-ing, Betrayal At Club Low is an old-school, dice-throwing RPG through and through. Every interaction you have at Club Low is determined by the rolling of dice, whether it's simply attempting to spark a conversation with a hard-of-hearing bartender, or bluffing your way into VIP backrooms where your blown fellow agent Gemini Jay is currently being grilled by the intimidating Big Mo. \nWhether you're successful in your endeavours depends on whether you can roll higher or equal to whatever value is thrown by your opponent, with each face corresponding to a particular Skill Dice you're trying to deploy to win that scenario. A lot of the time, your skill numbers aren't nearly good enough to beat your fellow clubber outright, but for me, the thrill of Club Low comes from clinching a very plain, and highly unremarkable draw, earning you the accolade of 'Success. Barely' in the ensuing results breakdown. It may not sound very sexy, but in a world where the odds are fully stacked against you, barely succeeding will do me just fine here, thanks.\nRead more",

Samantha, one among my ragged band of survivors, breaks down sobbing on the ground and I direct Maki, a veterinarian, to do something about it. She punches Samantha full-on in the face, knocking her unconscious (“Oh, I guess that’s what ‘knock out’ means,” I realize a moment too late). Well, at least I don’t have to worry about her running off into the woods or something. It’s a rough start, but they have no choice but to work together from here on out.\nFor fans of the survival simulation genre, crashlanding on an alien planet is a familiar premise, but it's one Stranded: Alien Dawn absolutely smashes. This game has been at the top of my to-be-played list for a while and now that it’s exiting early access for a full release, it’s safe to say that Stranded is the closest thing to my dream human vs nature survival game I’ve seen yet.\nRead more",

A brand new method for delivering piping hot recs from my desktop to yours.\nMy aim is to use this series as a springboard to dive deep into specific elements of a game I find particularly fascinating, sharing my discoveries with you lot behind the paywall first (and don't worry, regular readers, I'll also be making each of these videos public for all to see after a month, which should roughly coincide with the the next one going live for supporters). In it, I'll be discussing some common themes between multiple games, digging into underappreciated gems from years gone by... The remit is broad and nebulous, to the point where it's clearly obvious why I haven't been able to come up with a name for it yet.\r\n\n(If you end up thinking of something, please do let me know in the comments. More than anything it'll stop me messaging Katharine a list of awful possibilites every other week, which I can only imagine is negatively effecting her feelings about me, the site and the endeavour of games journalism in general.

          "description": "I'm now the proud owner of a Steam Deck and I think it's fantastic. It's a genuine marvel how I'm able to lay on the couch and play Like A Dragon: Ishin, or stream Resident Evil 4 - with admittedly, a ropey success rate - to it from my PC in the other room. I've even been reunited with some old friends, too. Welcome back to the fold, Rogue Legacy 2.\nBut my time spent with the Deck has me thinking that my gaming priorities have changed. I'm no longer excited by consoles that promise better graphics or blazing fast loading speeds. At least, not for big boxes designed for living rooms. Right now, I'm far more excited by the practicality of handhelds and how they'll evolve. The Deck might be the future, but it's also brought me back to my past.\nRead more",

The top-down action RPG The Mageseeker: A League Of Legends Story is looking to fix that, though, letting you play as the ex-convict and buff mage Sylas while he’s busy running a revolution. It comes from the developers behind the Zelda-like shop roguelite Moonlighter, and it's out now.\r\n\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I’m too prejudiced against first-person melee games to enjoy Dead Island 2 as much our reviewer Rick Lane did, but even a mind as narrowed as mine can appreciate its slick performance on PC. I wanted to see how well that smoothness and stability would carry over to the Steam Deck, and although the long-delayed zombie mulcher needs some cuts to quality settings, finding the right balance will have Dead Island 2 running almost as comfortably as the very best Steam Deck games.\nAlas, it’s still not the ideal handheld game, thanks both to the odd crash (lowering settings helps with this) and the fact that it needs some tinkering with the Epic Games Launcher to get it playable in the first place. Still, playable it very much is.\nLet’s start by addressing Dead Island 2’s lack of a Steam version; it launches on February 21st as an Epic Games exclusive, and since DI2 isn’t even listed on Steam right now, that’s unlikely to change any time soon. Luckily, there are workarounds: you can either install the Heroic Launcher, or follow our handy guide on how to install the Epic Games Launcher on the Steam Deck. Both of these should allow you to get Dead Island 2 downloaded onto the handheld, still using your regular Epic account.\n Read more",

          "description": "Back in the mists of time (January 2020), I was absolutely transfixed by a Japanese novel called Before The Coffee Gets Cold. It's about a small, cosy café where customers can travel back in time by sitting in a very particular chair, for the length of time it takes for a cup of coffee to go cold. It's not long by any means, but it affords its cast of regulars the chance to get some closure on an issue that's often been plaguing them throughout their lives. It's heart-warming, soppy stuff, but very feel-good. That January was also about the same time I slurped up every last episode of Midnight Diner on Netflix, where a chill Japanese man known only as The Master serves up delicious looking dishes in a tiny, 10-person izakaya from midnight onwards. Put these two things together, and it's probably no surprise that I liked the original Coffee Talk more than most.\nCoffee Talk Episode 2: Hibiscus & Butterfly is a continuation of that story, set three years later in the same, alternate version of Seattle where elves, werewolves, orcs, mermaids and other fantastical creatures all rub shoulders as city-dwelling citizens in need of a good cuppa. Once again, you play as the owner of the titular late-night coffee shop, brewing up a multitude of exotic hot drinks that you'll need to match to each customer's request that night as they tell you their woes. \nRead more",

Galaga '88, operating as both a remaster of the original Galaga and a sequel to 1984's Gaplus, players take control of the iconic Blast Fighter vessel for more space-based warfare against the forces of the titular enemy. As one would expect, Galaga '88 features much-improved audio/visual elements, including more detailed character sprites and a variety of background images.\nCheck out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber World of Longplays.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62h9LUt3OQg&ab_channel=WorldofLongplays\nDespite receiving much acclaim from critics and Japanese arcade goers, Galaga '88 would receive slight home ports, appearing via the PC Engine as the confusingly renamed Galaga '90, as well as on the Sharp X68000 home computer. In later years, the shmup would find itself packaged as part of numerous Namco compendiums, while also appearing on the Wii Virtual Console and even Japanese mobile platforms.\nGalaga '88 is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nThe post Galaga ’88 brings a r-r-remix to the Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

We’ve established that the Castlevania series has never been very good when it comes to its 3D titles, but the N64 games are likely the most worthwhile.\nThe second title on the N64, Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness, is easily the worthwhile-est. That’s mostly because it’s essentially an apology for Castlevania 64. Love it or hate it, it’s hard to deny that Castlevania 64 had the signs of rushed development. This wasn’t anything overly major – most of its glaring problems today aren’t atypical for the time period it was released – but it comes down to a lack of polish. More notably, but less noticeably, Konami cut two characters of the planned four.\nLegacy of Darkness r…",

On top of that, the Nintendo 64 was a strange console. Conservative in its insistence to stick to the cartridge format while everyone else was moving to disc, yet unique enough to create a controller that was innovative and incomprehensible in equal measures. The N64 was an over-engineered mess that alienated developers and publishers.\nI love it.\nIt’s not even because of the many great games that came out for it (the PlayStation admittedly had more), it’s just because it was so strange.

Dropped earlier today by Forever Entertainment, it outlines the plot of the second game and shows off some of its locations.\nSet 12 years after the events of the first game, Front Mission 2 is set against the backdrop of a coup d’etat in one of the OCU’s nations. The trailer has this really intense-sounding dude reading some really dull lines. “Monitor the situation in this country torn apart by civil war.” Monitor? That’s the best word you could use? Not something like “get embroiled?” Like, at least use a word that makes it sound like you’re participating in some way.\nhttps://youtu.be/nLaoh8SWCMc\nDire need for a thesaurus aside, I love the style of Front Mission 2. Its gritty urban settings remind me simultaneously of Japanese PS2 war games and Sega Genesis titles. They’re grey, sure, but I could stare at them all day. I really don’t know how to explain it, I just love the aesthetic.\nThe Front Mission 2 remake is particularly exciting, as no version of it has previously been released in North America. It initially released in 1997 for the PlayStation, but it stayed exclusive to Japan. The first Front Mission remake was pretty exciting for me, so I’m looking forward to moving onto this one.\nFront Mission 2: Remake will launch on Switch June 12, 2023.

Developer poncle's ever-evolving auto-fighting survival game has an animated series in the works.\nVia Deadline, poncle's founder Luca Galante is partnering with Story Kitchen, the company working on other game adaptations like Sifu, Streets of Rage, and more. Founded by John Wick writer and creator Derek Kolstad, Sonic the Hedgehog film and TV producer Dmitri M. Johnson, and former APA agent and partner Mike Goldberg, Story Kitchen is certainly tackling a decent amount of video game adaptations. Games consulting agency Robot Teddy will also be supporting the show.\nAs for what the show will be about? Well, that's still a bit unclear.\n\"The most important thing in Vampire Survivors is the story, so it's a dream come true to see what started as a little indie game I made on my weekends come to life as an animated TV show!\" Gallante said in a press release. \"It’s also great to be partnering up with such experienced and talented people to make the show. I do wonder if they've realised that there isn't a single vampire in Vampire Survivors, though.\"\nThe release confirms that, just like the game, the actual existence of vampires has not been confirmed.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvMkS6GcxFU\nAdapting the Survivors\nNormally I'd be wary, but it seems like poncle and Gallante are keeping a bit of fun mixed in with the whole project. Seeing as Vampire Survivors draws heavily on past works like Castlevania, it's hard not to see the potential; but I'm also curious to see how those ideas play out, and look any different, in a Survivors series.\nAs long as there's some solid garlic jokes, though, I'll probably be along for the ride. Vampire Survivors was a surprise hit that's kept growing with time, and I can't say I'm not curious to see what this team does with their very own series adaptation.\nThe post A Vampire Survivors animated series is in the works appeared first on Destructoid.",

Via Valve's blog about the feature, the Notes will allow for rich text formatting, multiple notes per game, and can be used offline. They'll also be saved per game and synced across to any other PCs you log into.\nThat alone sounds nice, if not all too different from using the Notepad app on your desktop. The aspect that puts it over for me is the ability to pin windows into the overlay, so they can appear in-game. With adjustable opacity levels and …",

          "description": "Goofy poster released to celebrate launch date\nPeacock has announced a premiere date for its long-time-coming TV adaptation of PlayStation's apocalyptic, vehicular franchise Twisted Metal — The series is now scheduled to premiere on the Peacock streaming service on July 27.\nA new teaser dropped on April 28, showing Anthony Mackie's character gearing up for a drive into the battlefield. While we don't see too much other than cars and destruction, the teaser does end with a brief tease of the Twisted Metal mainstay Sweet Tooth.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYb_HFHJJHs\nTwisted Metal, as previously reported, will star Mackie (Marvel's Falcon) as a slick, smart-mouthed courier who, down on his luck, accepts a shady offer to carry a mysterious package across the dystopian wastelands that surround the city — packed with marauding gangs and hazardous terrain, and haunted by the disturbing, ice-cream-truck-driving serial killer known as Sweet Tooth.\nJoining Mackie on this death-laden voyage will be Stephanie Beatriz (Brooklyn Nine-Nine), Thomas Haden Church (Spider-Man 3), and Neve Campbell (Scream) in currently undisclosed roles. Will Arnett will provide the voice of Sweet Tooth, while the notorious murderer's physical presence will be that of legendary pro-wrestling star Samoa Joe. Cobra Kai's Michael Jonathan Smith served as writer and showrunner for the series, which wrapped filming last summer and is now in post-production.\nTwisted Metal is one of a number of PlayStation film and TV adaptations currently in development. Via its PlayStation Productions arm, Sony has also commissioned projects based on popular franchises such as Uncharted, God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, Gran Turismo, and Ghost of Tsushima.\nTwisted Metal will premiere on Peacock July 27.\nThis post has been updated to add the teaser trailer, following its premiere.\nThe post Twisted Metal TV series will premiere on Peacock in July appeared first on Destructoid.",

Also remember that any shipments are bundled together, so you can pay a flat rate for multiple items instead of paying it each time.

To be clear, this particular challenge run involves swapping every enemy into Malenia: one of the toughest bosses in the game. Hilariously, the mod even titles bosses appropriately, like \"Malenia, the First Elden Lord\" or \"Eden Malenia\" for the final encounter. Who else to better handle this bizarre task than Let Me Solo Her: the legendary hero of the community that was even recognized by the developers.\nLet Me Solo Her has been documenting their journey through an all Malenia run for about a month, and just finished this week. They even went in with self-imposed parameters:\nDon't level vigor (the stat that grants players HP)\nGet the Jar Helm (and wear no other armor)\nBeat the game\nIt sounds \"simple,\" right? Well, it took them roughly 10 hours! While they were a bit hard on themselves with recounting their clear time, I'm sure a lot of folks spent 10 hours in a single area, so they probably shouldn't sweat it too much. I mean, the lack of HP and defensive gear essentially amounts to a \"no hit\" run with an infamous boss subbed in for hundreds of potential enemies. Fair trade!\nWhere to watch Let Me Solo Her run through Elden Ring with the Malendia mod\nYou can check out their journey on their official YouTube channel, and the finale is embedded below\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-OORwgQXjs\nThe post Elden Ring superstar Let Me Solo Her beats mod where every enemy is Malenia appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Most successful Q1 in hardware history\nSony has released its financial results for the latest fiscal quarter, revealing that princely PlayStation 5 (PS5) hardware has surpassed 38 million sales since its launch back in the fall of 2020.\nThe first quarter of 2023 has been especially impressive for the PS5 platform, and has seen a total of around 6.3 million consoles shipped since the start of the year. This represents the most successful Q1 shipping totals for any console in gaming history, and is up a mammoth four million units over the same period in 2022. When compared to its predecessor, PS4, PlayStation 5 is tracking just behind that platform's sales to the same point, suggesting that the coming years will see PS5 meet — and likely surpass — PS4's total sales.\nSony also revealed that it currently counts 47.4 million PlayStation Plus subscribers, which is equal to the amount of subscribers counted for the same period in 2022. This sees the PlayStation brand recover from the dip it suffered over the course of 2022's latter half. Game sales, however, continue to slide, as PS4 and PS5 software sales sold 68 million units in the first quarter of 2023, which is down 2.5 million from the 70.5 million titles sold in the same period 2022.\nThere are several possible reasons for this, including both the increase in PlayStation Plus subscribers utilizing the catalog of titles offered online as part of the service, as well as the staggeringly top-tier Q1 that was enjoyed in 2022, with releases including Elden Ring, Sifu, The King of Fighters XV, Horizon Forbidden West, and Gran Turismo 7.\nOff the back of today's figures, Sony is confident that it will ship 25 million consoles in the financial year ending March 2024 which, if secured, will represent a record in PlayStation hardware sales history.\nThe post PlayStation 5 console shipments and sales surpass 38 million appeared first on Destructoid.",

While the minimum is roughly what you'd expect, getting Redfall up to Ultra is going to take some solid hardware.

It normally wouldn't be too much of a concern, and anecdotally, I've never had too many problems with Arkane's PC versions.\nStill, it won't be long until we know for sure, as Redfall is just a few short days away.

          "description": "Vampire Survivors is going Hollywood thanks to the announcement of an upcoming animated TV adaptation. \nDeveloper poncle has confirmed that it's working with gaming consulting company Robot Teddy and media company Story Kitchen to bring the hit arcade bullet hell game to the small screen. Story Kitchen is helmed by names such as Dmitri Johnson (co-producer of the Sonic the Hedgehog films), John Wick creator/writer Derek Kolstad, and APA agent Mike Goldberg. There’s currently no other details about what the series will entail, such as the cast or a premiere date. \n“The most important thing in Vampire Survivors is the story, so it's a dream come true to see what started as a little indie game I made on my weekends come to life as an animated TV show! It’s also great to be partnering up with such experienced and talented people to make the show. I do wonder if they've realised that there isn't a single vampire in Vampire Survivors, though,” says Luca Galante, founder of poncle in a press release.\nIf you're tilting your head wondering how a pixelated arcade game can be translated into a show, it's worth nothing that Vampire Survivors has been brought to life in animated form before. Its two expansions – Legacy of the Moonspell and the recently launched Tides of the Foscari – both featured slick animated trailers, so those could be reference points for how this series may potentially appear. \nVampire Survivors has been on quite a roll since it launched to widespread acclaim last year, scooping up several end-of-year awards and walking away with a couple of BAFTA trophies this year, including winning Best Game.

Check it out below. \n\n\n\nOriginal Story: The live-action Twisted Metal TV series got its first poster today, courtesy of IGN, ahead of a teaser trailer scheduled to drop later today. The upcoming adaptation of the classic PlayStation car combat series is set to premiere this July. \nTwisted Metal is being developed by Peacock and stars Anthony Mackie as protagonist John Doe, a “smart ass” delivery driver who transports supplies between settlements in a post-apocalyptic America. He has no memory of his past but gets a chance at a better life by making one special delivery across the dangerous landscape. \nWe have the exclusive new poster for @Peacock’s #TwistedMetal show starring Anthony Mackie.\nhttps://t.co/DDXNXG0VxD pic.twitter.com/ktYebJN6M0\nApril 27, 2023\nTonally, the series is billed as an action comedy.

The cast also includes Stephanie Beatriz, Thomas Haden Church, Richard Cabral, Tahj Vaughans, and Neve Campbell. The show is being produced by Sony Pictures Television and PlayStation Productions, and it's the second TV adaptation of a first-party PlayStation game to arrive this year following The Last of Us. \nTwisted Metal premieres on July 27 exclusively on Peacock and consists of 10 half-hour-long episodes.

          "description": "Bloober Team and Anshar Studios have released a new Layers of Fear gameplay trailer to demonstrate the game's performance in Unreal Engine 5. \nLayers of Fear combines the experience of the first two Layers of Fear games, as well as both games' DLC, into one single game. It will also feature a new chapter called \"The Final Note\" that gives players an alternate perspective on the first game's story. Layers of Fear is being developed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. You can check out the game's performance, as well as its new mechanics and visual enhancements, in the gameplay trailer below: \n\n\nLayers of Fear will support Ray-Tracing, HDR, and 4K resolution. Plus, it uses Lumen global illumination (you might recognize the word \"Lumen\" from Epic Games' Unreal Engine showcase back in 2021), Niagara visual effects \"to create particle effects in real time\" and Action System Controls \"to improve the development process and optimization of all gameplay mechanics,\" according to a press release. \n\"Creating games with Unreal Engine 5 is a great opportunity for the whole team, as it means our game development process can skyrocket in quality,\" Anshar Studios lead programmer Tomasz Bilnicki writes in the press release. \"It has an incredible power when it comes to the implementation of dynamic lighting, shadows, and potentially beautiful worlds for players to explore. We hope that – thanks to the engine – we'll provide players with the unique, immersive, visually stunning, and atmospheric experience in graphical fidelity.\" \nLayers of Fear will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in June. \nFor more, read Game Informer's review of Layers of Fear and then check out our thoughts on its sequel in our Layers of Fear 2 review. \nAre you picking up Layers of Fear this June?

Now, less than six months later, we have a release date, and it's probably sooner than you expected. \nThat's because Armored Core VI hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on August 25, 2023. From Software announced this out of nowhere with a surprise trailer today that runs more than three minutes long. It features plenty of flashy mech action and some teases about what might be going on in this beautiful (but distraught) sci-fi world. \nCheck out the new Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon trailer for yourself below: \n\n\nAs you can see, Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon is a drastic departure from the fantasy worlds of late that From Software has been creating, but this still looks decidedly From Software. And we can't wait to check it out in just a few months. \nThe trailer also reveals what you can expect from the game's various digital editions and the special Collector's Edition – check them both out below: \n\nArmored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon launches on August 25, 2023.

The launch trailer itself is more of what you'd expect from a Redfall trailer – vampires, cooperative action, special abilities, and plenty of FPS gunplay.

          "description": "Flashback 2 got a fresh gameplay trailer today showing off the sequel’s modernized graphical facelift as well as a November release window.\nThe sequel to the influential 1992 adventure game was first announced in 2021, but we haven’t seen much of it since its last teaser at Summer Game Fest last year. Today’s video provides a look at how hero Conrad B.

          "description": "Microsoft has released its financial results for Q3 of its 2023 Fiscal Year, which consists of roughly January through March of this year. In it, the company revealed that Xbox hardware revenue is down but its Xbox content and services revenue is slightly up thanks to Xbox Game Pass subscription growth. \nMore specifically, Xbox hardware is down 30% and Xbox content and services is up 3%. Overall, Xbox's gaming revenue is down 4%, though. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that the company set third-quarter records for monthly active users and devices, and that Xbox's gaming subscriptions (see: Game Pass) reached almost $1 billion this quarter. Despite this growth and revenue, though, Microsoft did not release new numbers regarding Game Pass subscription count – the latest count was 25 million in January 2022. \nAs for the dip in hardware revenue, Microsoft says the decline comes from the comparison of this quarter this year to the same quarter in the previous fiscal year, which gained a boost thanks to increased console supply. \nHere are some other numbers from Microsoft's financial results: \nRevenue was $52.9 billion, an increase of 7% (or 10% in constant currency)\nOperating income was $22.4 billion, an increase of 10% (or 15% in constant currency)\nNet income was $18.3 billion, an increase of 9% (or 14% in constant currency)\nXbox hardware revenue is down 30%\nXbox content and services revenue is up 3%\nOverall, Xbox gaming revenue is down 4%\nThese results arrived yesterday, shortly before the Competition and Markets Authority, a U.K. regulatory agency that serves the same purpose as the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., blocked Microsoft's $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard today. You can read more about that here. \nWhat do you think Xbox needs to do to increase Xbox hardware revenue? Let us know in the comments below!",

It's a move similar to the one the team's former managing director, Hermen Hulst, made in 2019, transitioning from that director position to head of Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios. \n\n\nWithin that statement, Guerrilla teases what could be Horizon 3 or at least, a third game in Aloy's world, as reported by PlayStation Lifestyle. \n\"We have full confidence in our new leadership as they steer Guerrilla towards a bright future, expanding the world of Horizon with Aloy's next adventure and our exciting online project,\" the statement reads. \nAs you can see, Guerrilla isn't trying to hide it – the studio has plans for another adventure with Aloy. And while rumors and speculation point to the \"exciting online project\" being some kind of multiplayer game within the Horizon world, this statement made sure to separate Aloy's next adventure and that online project. \nIn terms of the studio's new makeup, the management team now consists of studio and production director Joel Eschler, studio director and general manager Hella Schmidt, and studio and art director Jan-Bart van Beek. Technical director Michiel van der Lee will \"be focusing on the future technology and strategy for the Decima engine.\" \nThis statement also includes some words from Smets, who leaves Guerrilla after \"an incredible 20 years\" there: \nFor more about Horizon, read Game Informer's Horizon Forbidden West review. \n[Source: PlayStation Lifestyle]\nWhat do you think comes first?

We'll also have every episode available the next day on our Game Informer Shows YouTube Channel. \nBanjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts was released for the Xbox 360 on November 11, 2008. The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it?

          "description": "Much like its predecessor, Street Fighter 6 will have an ambitious post-release content plan. While we knew there would be downloadable content, we now have a much better idea about the cadence with which the new characters will arrive.\n\"A big part of Street Fighter's charm is the cast of characters from around the world that appear in each game,\" executive producer Shuhei Matsumoto said during today's Street Fighter 6 Showcase livestream. \"We believe that Street Fighter is where players can take control of unique characters with their own awesome fighting styles. For the players – and for us as well – the appeal of the characters themselves is the most important element of the series. With Street Fighter 6, we're continuing development to deliver new characters to you every year.\"\nDuring Year 1, which kicks off when the game launches, we will receive four new characters to the Street Fighter 6 roster. Rashid, A.K.I., Ed, and Akuma are the characters who will be made available during this first year of content. Rashid, who debuted in the base version of Street Fighter V, arrives in summer 2023. A.K.I., an all-new character, will arrive in fall 2023. Ed, who debuted in Street Fighter IV but was first playable in Street Fighter V, arrives in the early parts of 2024. Akuma, the Great Demon who first appeared in Super Street Fighter II Turbo, joins Street Fighter 6 in spring 2024. These characters will also appear in World Tour, the single-player RPG-inspired story mode, giving players some insight into their backgrounds.\nIf you buy either the Deluxe ot Ultimate Editions, you get the Year 1 characters included in that version. Street Fighter 6 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on June 2.

Thus, it's opening the gates of Sanctuary to players one more time in a third open beta next month. \nThis next test weekend, dubbed Server Slam weekend, begins May 12 at 12 p.m. Pacific and ends May 14 at the same time. As the name suggests, Blizzard is running this beta to stress test the servers to make sure they're as sturdy as possible come June. This slice of the game is similar to the March betas in terms of content, but it will include updates and bug fixes garnered from feedback to the previous betas.\nServer Slam weekend will be a clean slate as progression from the previous betas does not carry over. Additionally, the beta supports couch co-op, cross-play, and cross-progression. Players can explore Fractured Peaks in its entirety through the Prologue and Act 1, complete World Events, and face Ashava, the toughest available World Boss. Completing challenges can earn the following new rewards:\nThe Initial Casualty title (earned by reaching Kyovashad with one character)\nThe Early Voyager title (earned by reaching Level 20 on one character)\nThe Beta Wolf Pack Cosmetic (earned by reaching Level 20 with one character)\nA new reward: the Cry of Ashava Mount Trophy (earned by defeating Ashava with one Level 20 character).\nDiablo IV launches on June 6 for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.

It will release on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC. Alongside this release date, Night School Studio also released a new trailer showcasing more of what to expect in this spooky paranormal thriller and there's a lot going on. \n\n\nSet five years after the first Oxenfree, which was released in 2016, Oxenfree II follows Riley as she returns to her hometown of Camena to investigate some strange electromagnetic waves. Just four hours ago, a mysterious cult opened a portal above Edwards Island, and Riley and her friends aren't sure they're the ones that need to save the island but they know they have to. The trailer seems to indicate we'll be playing with different timelines, spooky ghosts from other side, and more, and we'll be doing so using a special radio. \nThis time, though, we'll also have a walkie talkie to interact with locals and learn more about what might be going on. Oxenfree II: Lost Signals looks great and it hits PlayStation, Switch, and PC on July 12, 2023. \nOxenfree II: Lost Signals was originally due out in 2022 but it was delayed to 2023 last September.

Publisher Humble Games announced this during today's Nintendo Indie World Showcase alongside a new trailer showcasing more of the game's titular night market. Unsurprisingly, Mineko's Night Market continues to look great and we can't wait to learn more about this special village later this year. \n\n\nIn Mineko's Night Market, an old Japanese-inspired village at the center of Mt. Fugu is visited long ago by Miko, a cat-like god. Miko visits the farms of this village each year to grant good fortune and prosperity to the farmers. However, some farmers grow impatient with their blessings and drive Miko out. With Miko banished from the land, this village works hard to create its own success and as time goes on, fewer and fewer people believe in the myth of Miko. \nBut some still do, and it sounds like we'll learn more about what that means for some characters throughout our journey in the game. \nIn the game, you'll befriend townsfolk, craft doodads, and ultimately prepare for the weekly night market. The quiet village becomes a bustling hub of commerce, parades, cat races, and stage performances. And when you're exploring the island, everything you find can be brought back and sold on the market. \nMineko's Night Market hits Switch and PC on September 26, 2023.

That means the game is essentially complete and is ready to be pressed to discs.\nThe game is set to arrive on PlayStation and Xbox consoles plus PC, and while it's good to go for launch, Blizzard plans to continually update the always-online game with various content updates over the next several years. Fans recently got to explore the game's revamped take on Sanctuary for themselves in two back-to-back weekend open betas in March, letting them taste a big slice of the now-finished pie.\n“Going gold is a landmark milestone for the incredible Diablo IV team, who have all worked so hard crafting the next-generation installment of this iconic franchise. This is a concrete, meaningful step toward our June 6 launch,” said Rod Fergusson, general manager of Diablo. “Whether players are veterans of the franchise or jumping in for the first time, we can’t wait for everyone to experience the full game: taking part in the incredible storytelling, experimenting with character classes and builds, and exploring what the endgame and the dark world of Sanctuary has to offer.”\nDiablo IV is Game Informer’s cover story this month, and you can subscribe to the digital issue to read it right now.

In his announcement tweet, Staten confirms that the game is a brand-new IP and referred to the project as a \"AAA multiplatform\" experience. You can read the full tweets below.\nSo today, I'm thrilled to announce that I've joined @Netflix Games as Creative Director for a brand-new AAA multiplatform game and original IP. Let's go! 2/2\nApril 17, 2023\nStaten is best known for his work as a writer and cinematic director at Bungie and Microsoft, mainly working on the Halo series. While he spent a few years working at the publishing side of Microsoft, in 2020, he returned to the Halo series to work on Halo Infinite, where he worked as the game's creative director. This continued until earlier this year when he returned to the publishing side of the company amidst widespread layoffs. Now, he's left the company entirely to work on this new project with Netflix.\nThis is only the latest news in Netflix's spree of expansion into the gaming industry. It recently released a sequel to Valiant Hearts as part of a collaboration with Ubisoft. Last year, it acquired the developers behind Cozy Grove, bringing its total number of internal development teams to five if you include the in-house studio that Staten just joined. On top of that, the film and tv side of Netflix has been working on loads of game adaptations, including Gears of War, Pokémon Concierge, and a new patch of episodes of Sonic Prime.\nDo you play games through your Netflix subscription?
