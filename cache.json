This obviously plays to The Chinese Room's strengths - they're better known for melancholy or horrifying strolls through broken spaces than the Dishonorable massaging of intricate systems. But it also reflects Paradox's view that the original Bloodlines has been \"mythologised\" a bit: people love the memory of it more than the reality, and there are aspects of the 2004 game, according to Paradox's deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja, that simply \"wouldn't fly today\".\n Read more",

          "description": "It’s easy to think of your PC’s RAM as something that just needs to be enough, rather than a powerhouse like the graphics card or CPU. Easy for me, anyway, until testing out the Silent Hill 2 remake this past week served up a reality check: modern games need a lot of memory, and in SH2’s case, might not even get past the Steam launcher if they decide you’re lacking in it. As penance, I’ve found some DDR5 RAM deals in the Prime Big Deal Days sales that should set any modern rig for years and years of... well, games launching properly, I suppose.\nAs such, while 16GB is the bare minimum you can get away with, I’d recommend 32GB to be safe. For pure value, check out Crucial’s DDR5 Pro set, which I've been using in my own testing setup for a while: it’s down from £140 to £80 on Amazon UK, and down from $150 to $81 on Amazon US. But the single best deal here, I reckon, is Corsair’s Vengeance RGB kit, which the US site has slashed from $130 to $100. That’s the same price as the non-RGB equivalent kit while also being faster, at 6400MHz to 6000MHz. Us UK folk can also get a similar set for £101, down from £147, though that’s set at 6000MHz.\nRead more",

          "description": "A few months ago, Broken Sword creator Charles Cecil walked out of the office of Revolution Software and onto the Shambles, the Diagon Alley-esque street that has survived since York’s days as a medieval trade hub. He closed the door behind him, somewhat grumpily - he’d had to work late, and it was already past eight o’clock. Then a voice piped up behind him.\n\"And one day, when you get older, you will play Broken Sword,\" said a young woman to her toddler. \"This is where Revolution are based.\"\nCecil had stumbled across an annual pilgrimage to the site where British point-and-click adventures are made. From the sounds of it, this young woman was not alone in making the journey. Cecil registered Revolution’s office address on Google a year ago - and received an email to say that 40,000 people have checked it out since.\n\"We’re incredibly blessed to have a really positive and lovely collection of people who want us to succeed and love the games that we write,\" Cecil says. \"We love our interaction with them.\"\nThese might read like the words of a good community manager, rather than a man expressing a deeply-held sentiment. Yet Cecil does not take his relationship with Revolution’s fans for granted. At times in his long career, he has lost touch with his audience. And at others, he’s feared they might turn their back on him.\nRead more",

          "description": "For the record, I still think it’s easier and safer to go with a microSD for your Steam Deck storage needs, and with good Prime Big Deal Days savings on two of the best – the Samsung Pro Plus and the SanDisk Ultra – that opinion remains unbudged. Still, you know what they say: when you’re holding a tiny screwdriver, everything starts to look like a tiny screw. So I understand if the call to replace the Deck’s internal SSD, or indeed that of your Asus ROG Ally, proves too strong.\nIn which case, have a look at the Crucial P310, which I added to our best SSDs list just last week, and is currently joining in the Prime sale frivolities. Specifically, the 1TB model has been slashed from £128 to £70 on Amazon UK, while it’s the 2TB version that gets a US discount, dropping from $265 to $168.\nRead more",

          "description": "The obvious way of bundling up Beautiful Light is probably \"Hunt Showdown meets S.T.A.L.K.E.R.\", and whoops, I've already committed to that in the headline. But the first game that came to mind when I chanced on some playtest footage last night was The Town Of Light, LKA's deeply disquieting game about exploring a carefully recreated abandoned asylum.\nThere's the title overlap, of course - it's always a bit of a provocation when horror games make a point of being well-lit. Beyond that, the two games share an interest in dessicated interiors where chairs huddle disconsolately, where the sun slides through windows whose curtains have rotted away, and the plaster flakes in ways both pretty and macabre. But where The Town Of Light gave you one rambling building's worth of encroaching hallucinations, Beautiful Light gives you a whole wilderness, where the architecture scales from \"dreary forgotten school\" to \"gleaming underground base\". It also gives you a lot of guns. Devised by Geneva-based Deep Worlds SA, this is a team extraction shooter where six squads of three gasmasked alpha-bravos compete to retrieve an artifact from a quarantine zone full of deadly anomalies. \n Read more",

While the company's core business in grand strategy remains prosperous, their approach to games outside this niche has been mired by delays, cancelations, closures and layoffs. Let's run through the big setbacks: The Lamplighters League, which we overall liked, was a $22 million financial flop - Paradox have now parted ways with creators Harebrained Studios. Cities Skylines 2 should have been a victory lap, after the success of the first game, but it launched with severe bugs and performance issues. Prison Architect 2, another follow-up to a hit game, has been delayed indefinitely, and Paradox have split from developers Double Eleven. Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is borderline vapourware: originally announced in 2019 with Hardsuit Labs at the helm, it's currently in the hands of The Chinese Room, and was recently delayed for the umpteenth time into 2025.\nAnd then there's the abrupt cancellation of Life By You, a life management sim designed to compete directly with The Sims 4, and the closure of its creators Paradox Tectonic. Writing-down the development of Life By You cost Paradox around 208 million krona, or $19.2 million. It was the primary contributor to a 90% decrease in the company's operating profit for the second quarter of 2024, versus the same quarter in 2023.\r\n \nRead more",

This isn't the type of story in which the protagonist has difficulty accepting the existence of horrors, nor struggles with the surreality of what he needs to do to get through a locked door. In the opening minutes, James finds a well with a glowing red square floating inside, stares into it (it saves your game), then makes a calm remark about the odd sensation he feels, and moves on. The human corpses that pepper the town of Silent Hill are noticeably that of James himself, his head bludgeoned and bloodied beyond recognition but his jacket and boots unmistakable. He makes no remark on this. It's probably nothing.\nRead more",

Having given it more thought, I think there are two metaphors: 1) It plays quite like Persona. 2) Its story is like a commentary on our society… or something to that effect.\nMetaphors aside, though, the game is a gigantic fantasy RPG that's technically better than Persona 5 in a lot of ways. Structurally, it feels less repetitive. It has more animated cutscenes that elevate those key story moments. You can brush aside weaker enemies in real-time combat, rather than face them in tiresome turn-based tangoes. And overall, I think it's the best game Persona or Persona-like Atlus have put out - it really is brilliant. But there's a part of me that feels like it's missing something that'll leave it less ingrained in the memory than Persona 5 once its final chapter has closed.\nRead more",

I’ll call it ‘system tourism’ in lieu of something better. It’s not like the actually fulfilling virtual tourism you might do in something like Yakuza’s Kamurocho, where you’re scarfing down deep fried whiskeys, entranced by the lights. It’s more like doing a Google street view tour of Venice’s canals to see if you can spot someone taking a leak off the side of a gondola - hunting for anarchic anomalies because, honestly, the sights just aren’t grabbing you.\nAt the risk of sounding like some sort of horrible joy-mathematician: My experience with open world zombie survival game Dread Dawn involved precisely two and half discrete instances of fun, plus some additional appreciation for a few genuinely good ambient bits I’ll get into shortly. With a significant overhaul of basically every player interaction Dread Dawn offers - from the abysmally tedious looting to the rusty combat -  it might some day be worth your time. It harbours some incredible ambition, though it’s surrounded by murk and detritus, like a dictatorial rat in a toilet bowl.

I seek to approach without approaching, scooting back and forth across the path like a stray hamster, worrying at the corners and avoiding clear perspectives of the route ahead, while keeping the route behind me in my peripheral vision. I have been trained to do this especially by Amnesia, where tilting your gaze too decisively at anything nasty drives your character nuts.\nLurks Within Walls has no time for my hamstery antics. Developed by Here Be Monsters, it's a grid- and turn-based first-person dungeon crawler - a long-lost cousin of Etrian Odyssey that has wound up in an asylum jammed with internet cryptids, reminiscent in cinematic texture of F.E.A.R. In keeping with other grid-based dungeon crawlers, it only lets you turn the view by 90 degree angles and travel in straight lines. Going by the demo, it's a promising restraint for a horror game, though they really do need to expand on the combat, which is currently a slight waste of some terrific creature art. \r\n \nRead more",

It’s a point-and-click that calls back to early 90’s Lucas Arts adventure games, and while it shares the same frustrations, the presentation makes it feel entirely contemporary.

As such, the flow of news to the dark god of video games journalism was sluggish. Thankfully, the Maw seems to have let us off lightly. It could have risen kraken-like from the abyss and swallowed the planet. Instead, it has merely summoned an extra moon. Quickly now, let's run through the week's PC game releases of note and top the Maw up before that bonus satellite does anything unconventional, like growing teeth.\n Read more",

I’ve seen, read, heard, intuited and telepathically detected a lot of complaints about Outlaws stealth, ranging from “it doesn’t look realistic when she punches out stormtroopers through their blaster-resistant hats” to “please remove the hide-and-seek entirely, I wishly merely to pew-pew”. Seems likely that the patch won’t lay all these grievances to rest, to say nothing of the other problems people have with Outlaws.

Most of the audience for that screening rocked up fully equipped with suspenders, feather boas, extravagant lipstick, and a cherished selection of deliberately unfunny heckler's lines to deploy at key moments in the movie.\nHave you not seen the Rocky Horror Show? It's a wildly camp musical and B-movie homage for stage and screen, in which two homely, heteronormative Americans seek shelter in a castle run by Tim Curry's high-kicking mad scientist Dr Frank-N-Furter. I can't speak for how well it has aged, but it was a hit work of sexual counterculture in the 1970s, and is absolutely Curry's finest hour outside of Command And Conquer. \r\n \nRead more",

Created by two-person Hannah and Joseph Games, it casts you as one of the Vollings - a race of gaunt elven humanoids, hailing from the same school of manky action-figure as Judero, who have been shunned by their gods and have accordingly turned to paganism. \r\n\n\r\nSpecifically, you're a lord who has set up a spice farm on a \"cursed\" island, the former home of a long-dead civilization. This certainly sounds like a foolish thing to do, and it's no huge surprise that everybody on your farm has gone missing. So off you trot with a team of four custom-generated companions to solve the mystery, and also make up gnarly spells by daubing your blood on trees.\r\n \nRead more",

This must be how Guardiola feels, popping onto the pitch to celebrate his annual Prem title with the latest batch of ruthlessly efficient, lab-grown wonderkids and pushing down the feeling that this one doesn’t feel quite as special as the first.\nThat is to say, EA Sports FC25 is a bit like FC24. Which was quite a lot like FIFAs 21-23, which had a lot in common with the FIFAs our ancient ancestors used to play by the fireside in their primitive tribal dwellings. There are noticeable additions - particularly new tactics controls and a 5v5 Rush mode - and I’m glad they’re here. But as much as they contribute towards a continuously compelling suite of foot-to-ball, they can’t quite dislodge the nagging feeling that this shouldn’t be an annual, full-price release anymore.\nRead more",

Take 12 blanks, doodle some faces and landscapes, and lo, you have a procedural narrative generator. Make some duplicates, invent a few rules and lo, you have systems. \r\n\n\r\nConversely, the great drawback of cards - especially in those roguelite deckbuilders people have been churning out since Slay The Spire - is that everything can be reduced to them. For example: last night, I played a round of Fungi with my partner, Fungi being a charming tabletop foraging sim in which you gather scrumptious chantarelles and boletus from the forest floor. This morning I resumed playing Breachway, out now in early access, in which you guide a starship through a series of wartorn solar systems, with battles unfolding as a turn-based exchange of cards corresponding to ship components. \r\n\n \nRead more",

The Razer Wolverine V3 Pro (and its wired cousin, the Wolverine V3 Tournament Edition) has looked to desktop peripherals in search of superior button-bashing, cannibalising the rather good Razer Viper gaming mouse series for its switches. The result is a high-performing, satisfyingly clicky pad that, yes, works wonderfully on PC – albeit one that rinses you for four times(!) as much as a standard Xbox controller.\nRead more",

The second tool I obtained was a trumpet. It doesn’t really work like a trumpet, and it does things no regular trumpet could or should do. I got a trowel next. Here’s the thing about the trowel: it’s a pretty good trowel. Nothing fancy. But recently, I keep digging up… objects. Objects most peculiar. I’ve got the weekend to sort this garden, and a cosy little shed to sleep in, so I really should just get on with it. Again, though, I must reiterate: I keep digging up… objects.\nI go to clean some rubbish from the bathroom. I interact with the mirror and the game says: “You do not see anything in the mirror”. I take a note that says: I do not see anything in the mirror. I check the game again and no, I still do not see anything in the mirror. Sure it’s fine. Just a shit mirror, probably. They should get it replaced. What good is a mirror you can’t see anything in?\n \nRead more",

The Xe2 graphics performance under Linux was disappointingly slow with it performing even worse than Meteor Lake while RDNA3.5 graphics led. Intel has been investigating the Xe2 Linux graphics performance but I haven't heard any updates yet. Today the attention is on the Lunar Lake CPU side under Linux and it too isn't looking too good. The performance of this 8-core Core Ultra 7 256V SoC is poor in real-world multi-threaded scenarios and the performance-per-Watt is only compelling in a subset of workloads. The AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 and AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 Zen 5 SoCs tended to deliver the superior performance and power efficiency under Linux.",

While all armor tends to have random rolls for its stat distribution, specific armors can have additional bonuses. \n\n\nFor Episode: Revenant, a new set of armor is mentioned in the seasonal artifact but isn't properly explained. Here's what Shadestalker armor is in Destiny 2.\n\n\nWhere to get Shadestalker armor in Destiny 2\n\n\nImage via Destructoid\n\n\nShadestalker armor is one of two sets of armor added with Episode: Revenant. This armor is acquired through completing Episode: Revenant activities, opening Revenant Engrams, and through later levels in the Season Pass (for those who purchase the Season Pass). While activities and the Season Pass rewards are straightforward, Revenant Engrams are earned through ranking up with the Apothecary Eido seasonal vendor and as a reward through Episode: Revenant activities.\n\n\nShadestalker Armor plays into two separate seasonal artifact mods, Fell the Revenant and Total Carnage. With Fell the Revenant, each piece of armor increases the amount of damage you'll do to Scorn enemies. Otherwise, Total Carnage grants damage resistance and health on finishers if you're wearing at least two pieces of Shadestalker armor. \n\n\nIs Shadestalker armor worth using?\n\n\nImage via Destructoid\n\n\nShadestalker armor is well worth using this season. Beyond those two artifact mods mentioned above, this armor also sports the Eido's Apprentice armor perk. This grants one point of Apothecary Eido vendor reputation for each Reclaimed Vitality earned. For each piece of Shadestalker armor equipped, you get up to a maximum of four points per Reclaimed Vitality earned. This is a huge bonus for working toward completing the season, so slap this armor on when you get the chance.\n\nThe post What is Shadestalker armor in Destiny 2? appeared first on Destructoid.",

Thankfully, through the help of Failsafe, she's able to safely land the HELM within the Last City without causing serious damage.\n\n\nWhile the HELM is out of orbit, however, it is still accessible through the new Last City...with a little work. Here's how to access the HELM in Destiny 2 Episode: Revenant.\n\n\nHow to get to the HELM in Destiny 2 Episode: Revenant\n\n\nImage via Destructoid\n\n\nIf you're starting with Episode: Revenant and are in the Last City, you might've thought to open the map, and then click on the fast travel point for the HELM. However, this takes you right to the Last City fast travel point. This can be confusing, but you can thankfully still access the HELM without it. When loading into the Last City, turn immediately right and you'll see a large blue portal like the one pictured above. Head into it, and you'll be teleported to the lower stairs of the HELM.\n\n\nWithin the newly crashed HELM, you have access to all the kiosks you had before. You can still access the Vault, speak with the Postmaster, and talk to Failsafe through the central kiosk. You can even pet Captain Jacobson or the birds you collected, provided you did that content in the Episode: Echoes storyline. If you open the map, you can even access the Battlegrounds, Enigma Protocol, and Breach Executable from last season. The only thing you can't do is continue the Episode: Echoes storyline, as that disappeared with the launch of the newest Episode.\n\nThe post How to get to the HELM in Destiny 2 Episode: Revenant appeared first on Destructoid.",

Eggs and Milk can be purchased from Chez Remy after completing the Ratatouille realm in the castle and getting Remy into your valley. They will cost you 450 Star Coins altogether. Wheat seeds can be bought from Goofy's Stall in the Peaceful Meadow for 1 Star Coin. You might as well buy the ingredient itself if it's available, however, as it's very slightly more expensive at 2 Star Coins. It will only take one minute to grow once planted and watered. \n\n\nCocoa Beans are slightly trickier to find. They grow on trees within the Sunlit Plateau or the Glade of Trust every 30 minutes. You can also buy them from Goofy's Stall in the Sunlit Plateau for 75 Star Coins. \n\n\nAnother dessert you can make\n\n\nHave plenty of Cocoa Beans left? If that's the case, Hot Cocoa might be the way to go. You can form that with a Cocoa Bean, Milk, and Sugarcane. You can get Sugarcane (or its seeds) from Goofy's Stall in Dazzle Beach. Another dessert you can make without Cocoa Beans is Berry Salad. A Mint Sorbet is another way to go.\n\nThe post How to make Chocolate Waffles in Disney Dreamlight Valley appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Sonic Sway move has been a part of many Dragon Ball iterations, whether from the anime or its video game collection. It's a powerful defensive tool that can be used to avoid rapid attacks, making it an essential skill for any fighter.\n\n\nWe'll show you how to perform the Sonic Sway in Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero, furthering your defensive strategies.\n\n\nHow to consistently perform a Sonic Sway in Dragon Ball:  Sparking Zero\n\n\nYou can perform the Sonic Sway by holding your guard and pressing the Perception/Ki Blast button when an enemy attacks. Since there are two controller styles, the interaction for this will vary. To cover all the bases, here's how to perform Sonic Sway in Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero's Classic and Standard controller styles.\n\n\n\nStandard:\n\nPlayStation: R1 (Guard) + Circle (Perception)\n\n\nXbox: RB (Guard) + B (Perception)\n\n\n\n\nClassic:\n\nPlayStation: Circle (Guard) + Triangle (Ki Blast/Rush Chain)\n\n\nXbox: B (Guard) + Y (Ki Blast/Rush Chain)\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore the enemy approaches, start holding the guard interaction. Then, once they start attacking, use Perception/Ki Blast. You'll need to time it right by hitting the second button before the opponent strikes. Or, you can make it a bit easier by holding your guard up and spamming Perception/Ki Blast. This tactic has helped me land Sonic Sways consistently without worrying about the timing.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nWhen you've executed the Sonic Sway, a unique sound effect will confirm its success. Time will slow down, setting the stage for a sequence of multiple attacks. As your character gracefully dodges each one, you'll be treated to a thrilling experience reminiscent of the epic showdowns in the Dragon Ball series.\n\n\nTake advantage of this dodging tactic in Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero's World Tournament, Character Episodes, or online PvP. I suggest practicing it first in the training rounds to at least get the hang of it. \n\nThe post How to Sonic Sway in Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero appeared first on Destructoid.",

Fungovalo by to dobře jako normální (nehororové) současné drama. Ke konci se to trochu zvrhne do standardní vyvražďovačky, ale pořád výrazný nadprůměr s několika výbornými scenáristickými nápady. Neviděl jsem dánský originál. (Ilča 60 %)",
