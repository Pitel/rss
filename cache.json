If you’ve never heard of him, the 60-year-old has been in game coding and development, and seemingly happily off his rocker since 1979. Going by the moniker ‘Yak’, Minter cut his teeth on the Sinclair ZX60 in the early '80s, going on to form his own development studio, Llamasoft.\nHaving won a loyal following over the years thanks to visually disarming, aurally arresting and crudely dazzling arcade game score challenges, Minter is probably best known for Tempest 2000 (1994), a launch title for the Atari Jaguar that remains the system’s best exclusive. Its unique hallucinogenic style and breakneck urgency has gone on to define much of his output since, from Space Giraffe to Polybius, leading to the unsubstantiated but common inference that the programmer dabbles in psychedelic drugs.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

With two campaigns spanning each side of the sunny Mediterranean, this is arguably Relic's breeziest and most colourful theatre of war yet, evoking the same kind of swagger and gung ho optimism as a Hollywood action flick. It's a feeling that might seem out of place given the current climate, especially now, just days away from the first anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But while your main objective is always one of domination, gradually turning the map from red to blue on both a micro and macro scale, this is ultimately a game about searing comebacks - of beating back seemingly impossible aggressors, and finding hope where previously there was only despair. I think we could all do with a bit of that in this day and age, even if the battles before you end up feeling like nothing more than the digital equivalent of plonking down a big box of toy soldiers on your living room floor and going daka-daka-daka as they all fall over. \nRead more",

From an Nvidia tech demo back to in 2019 to an RTX-branded trailer released just last month, this souped-up lighting and reflection tech has been a key piston in propelling the Soviet sci-fi FPS’ hype train. Some slightly awkward news, then: the PC version won’t support ray tracing at launch.\nI noticed the lack of ray tracing options in the review build we received last week, and got in touch with the game's press relations team to check if I was missing something, or if they were due to be added via update. The response confirmed that their absence was not an error, and that \"the devs will be looking into implementing this post-launch.\" Well then!\nRead more",

          "description": "If you’re British and you’re old, then you love the ZX Spectrum. (Or the Commodore 64, I suppose, but not both. Never both.) Personally, I’m what they called a “Speccy” kid, and I have carried a deep and profound love of the elderly microcomputer’s cassette tape screeches, colour clash and long, long load times into my adult life, despite the fact that – and please don’t get upset, purists – many of the great Spectrum games don’t hold up in the cold light of the modern day. It’s not that the games are necessarily bad, more that they were tremendous for their time. Still eminently enjoyable, but they require the player to get their head into a certain zone, to put up with what are inarguably quite archaic controls and mechanics. \r\n\n\r\nOddly enough, there are some Spectrum games on Steam, thanks to a publisher called Pixel Games. However, with the utmost respect to their output… these are not the kind of games that are going to foster interest in the Speccy amongst modern players. Of course, that may well not be the point, but I’d be a little taken aback if even avowed old-school gamers were going to bother picking up the likes of gardening simulator Pedro, a game that scored 63% in Newsfield’s iconic Crash magazine back in the day, or Sam Stoat: Safebreaker, which did a little better at 68%.\nRead more",

They all force a little chuckle out of me, but none of them have made me belly laugh like I Am Jesus Christ, a first-person retelling of Christ’s tale from birth, to death, to rebirth.  \r\n\n\r\nI Am Jesus Christ’s genre is slightly murky, although, it almost looks like a giant Skyrim mod complete with unfeeling NPCs, first-person spellcasting, and an open world full of quest markers. The newest trailer shows some of Christ’s cool abilities like walking on water, shooting light beams at Satan, and fishing - which is incidentally what I’m looking forward to the most. \r\n\n\r\nIn fairness, the Christ sim looks like a pretty robust and thorough retelling of his journey, depicting scenes like the Last Supper, only this time all the disciples have exclamation marks above their heads. The Steam page also details 30 different miracles (or spells) and a number of different areas to explore. \r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Like all good fairytale characters, Pinocchio gets a revision every couple of years - except for 2022, when he was adapted thrice (mostly in bad films, except for the Del Toro one). The loveable puppet isn’t waiting too long for his next comeback, as the RPG Soulslike Lies Of P is coming to PC and Game Pass in August. \r\n\n\r\nLies Of P’s newest trailer is mostly a black screen with a lot of VO, but we get a clear look at Pinocchio's daddy Master Gepetto this time. The trailer follows a blob wobbling through very Victorian streets before it slides into some automation and uses the machine’s body as a puppet. The result is a boss-sized monstrosity that sits halfway between Lovecraftian horror and industrial defect. It also reminds me of Gears 5’s weird infected robots, with tentacles and slime hanging off their metallic arms - equally gross and cool.\r\n\n\r\nThe newest trailer doesn’t show off any Bloodborne-style combat, but we’ve had plenty of looks at that already, including a fight with a gorilla robocop. This Soulslike looks just as aggressive as you’d expect, emphasising quick dodge rolls and last-minute, anxiety-fueled parries. Pinocchio’s arm doubles up as a grappling hook to pull enemies in, which is always cool in a hack n’ slasher, and makes even more sense when you’re playing as a puppet. Also, is it just me or is Pinocchio pretty this time around?\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "Quickplay strategy games have always been a thing, but they appear to be gaining in popularity lately. I will probably regret not keeping Ozymandias aside for the traditional \"summer strategy game for when your brain is a gas\" bit, but the scene is looking healthy enough to chance it.\nYou know that cliché feeling of \"just one more turn\"? Ozymandias is a bronze age 4X that builds momentum enough to turn that into \"just one more game\". It is incredibly easy to learn, and despite looking a little dry and number heavy, becomes more effortless, more pleasant the longer you play. It also becomes more clear how much depth there is hidden away in such a light design. It's about proving yourself the most prestigious civilisation, not through total conquest, but by exploiting the lay of the land, and leaning into your strengths.\nRead more",

A wizard's not a real wizard until they have accidentally set themselves on fire or unleashed an ancient evil. And if you throw four of this dim demigods together? Well, you get the co-op wizard action of the Magicka games, where freestyling elemental combinations can (and often will) lead you to heal a boss or torch your pal's face.

I have totally forgotten what I was meant to be doing.\nLike A Dragon: Ishin feels like a step backward, but in a brilliant way. Kiryu and co. may have moved onto a turn-based future, yet Sakomoto Ryoma and his pals have turned back the clock to an Edo period of brawlin' and chicken betting that's most reminiscent of Yakuza 0, only it's not the roaring 80s but the bloody 1800s. There's nothing here that will convert those who aren't keen on the series, but if you're an ardent fan or a newcomer eager to experience its wild swings between serious and silly, Ishin is an excellent place to start.\nRead more",

I took the warning seriously, and thank God, because even the easiest difficulty had me pouring dandelion tea down my brother's throat like he was doing a kegstand (and in the game).\nÁine and Shane are a pair of Irish siblings who've moved to Oregon to start a new life, which, in the main story, involves eating potatoes and trying not to get depressed. It's difficult enough that I didn't think I would like it at first, as even basic tasks deplete your stamina and sleeping in your 1860s hovel with a hole in the roof doesn't restore very much per night. Áine can do spells, but they're simple and only really take the edge off what is a very hard life. Magic isn't a cure-all in Veil Of Dust, and using it has to be weighed up, just like everything else.\nRead more",

          "description": "It’s the dead of night. I’m in my little tugboat out on open waters. I can barely see three feet in front of my nose because of the thick blanket of fog, but I'm trying my hand at night fishing, hoping to hook something really good. I find a squid spot and start to fish, reeling in one or two fine-looking catches. The third one, however, is monstrous, a mess of jagged teeth and sickly pale flesh. Yes, this should make for a fine amount of cash. The more morbid it is, the more money I get. Suddenly there’s a deep rumbling in the ocean and panic starts to creep in. I chuck my prize into my cargo and speed back to town, the phrase ‘fuck round, find out’ circling my brain.\nI’ve not been playing Dredge long, but I’m calling it one of my favourite games of the year, right now, in February. Black Salt Games' sinister fishing RPG is gripping and enchanting in a way I didn’t anticipate. I’ve spent hours exploring its murky waters and my constant shock at what unsettling creatures my hook brings in is seemingly never-ending. Its eldritch world keeps pulling me back with its mystery and malevolent horror, and its sense of atmosphere and tension is incredible. Basically, I'm completely enraptured, hook, line, sinker. Dredge already feels like one of this year’s greatest indie horrors and all this, from a fishing game of all things.\nRead more",

But that’s the fate of deep-space astronaut Selene in Returnal, when she ditches her single-seater vessel on a remote rock called Atropos. Each time she falls foul of the local fauna, she pops back into existence right next to her broken ship, with no obvious means of escape. Forget Aliens vs Predator, this is Aliens vs Groundhog Day.\nBut what a day it is, as Returnal combines a best-in-class third-person shooter with a deep dive into the psychology of its protagonist. Selene’s journey into Atropos, through a thick jungle, a burning vermilion desert and beyond, sends her circling through a smorgasbord of emotions – from confusion to hope, despair to determination. And so often, her mood dovetails with your own highs and lows of elation and frustration, until every part of Returnal encases you in its loop.\nRead more",

          "description": "Loathe as I am to become one of those \"want to feel old?\" types of posters, this review requires me to point out that the original Pharaoh came out in 1999, almost 25 years ago. It was one of that era's City Building series that included Zeus and all of the Caesars, a run of games so good that they earned the capital letters. Pharaoh also happens to be one of my foundational video games, and I played it when I was knee-high to my big brother's desk, at a time when family homes had one (1) yellow-grey computer with a CRT screen. And now it's back, baby.\nPharaoh: A New Era means I can play that game of my childhood on my shiny black RGB-lit bastard. Honestly though, the \"A New Era\" part is a bit much. Sure, the updated graphics are fabulous and the quality of life changes mean it plays like smooth peanut butter to the 90s' extra crunchy. It's a good remake of a solid game, but the mummy in the casket is fundamentally the same.\nRead more",

Yes, they're cheap per gigabyte, yes they're fairly reliable, yes they're absolutely the way to go if you need to store a lot of data and don't care how long it takes to access it. But. But. These drives are hard to go back to after you're used to SSDs, with their near-instant access times, completely silent operation, resistance to shocks, drops and magnets and of course their overall SPEED. \nSo when I had the chance, I bought the biggest SSD I could afford, a 4TB model at the time, and copied literally every bit of data from the four or five 1TB or smaller hard drives that I'd bought over the years and stuck into my increasingly full PC tower. It was expensive, and it took ages to copy everything across, but as soon as I turned my computer on for the first time and I didn't have to listen to the clicks and whirs of a mechanical drive, I was completely convinced I'd made the right call to ditch spinning rust.  \nRead more",

Those cute art styles are almost always a front for a brutal sneak attack on your emotions.\nBlanc is very much aiming for your heartstrings with its adorable animal duo and picturesque snowy landscapes. The first half teases massive potential for a cutesy story with fun puzzle antics, but the game is majorly let down by a repetitive and often frustrating second half and lacklustre ending. After the promise of a warm, cosy adventure, I watched the end credits roll and couldn't help feeling like I'd been left out in the cold.\nRead more",

And I'm guessing it wants players to experience the joys of shredding goons, and a story told through unpredictable cuts to karaoke and anime. I'm sad to report that it isn't any of these things. Aside from the tiniest glimpses of cool when a combo comes together, the game clearly doesn't know what it wants to be, or if it did once upon a time, its original vision must've gotten lost under a dogpile of ideas. I rooted for it when I first saw it way back when, and got excited when I heard it was being made by devs behind Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive, but what's arrived is a jumbled mess that fights you at every turn. If I were Debra Meadon playing it for the first time live on Dragon's Den, and someone sidled up behind me and pressed a katana to my throat, I would still carefully put the controller down and say, \"It's a no from me\".\nRead more",

          "description": "Magic is weird. And, since an Ordinary (non-magical person) suddenly getting magic is also deemed weird in Ikenfell, it stands to reason that it’s practically guaranteed to happen. We can only assume the odds become even higher as the Ordinary ventures closer to the big magical fantasy school, which protagonist Maritte quickly discovers. Upon approaching the gate in search of her missing sister, Safina, Maritte suddenly starts to sling fiery spells.\nThose new spells certainly come in handy, as Maritte finds herself fired up (hehe, geddit?) and ready to fight through this Paper Mario-style tactical RPG. Along with some of Saf’s old friends, you explore the titular school and surrounding areas, searching for clues that might help unravel the mystery. Ikenfell has challenging combat and lots of little secrets hidden in its 8-bit world, but it’s the loveable bunch of pals (both allies and rivals) that really made me smile. Oh, and some of them have killer theme tunes that I can’t stop singing.\nRead more",

Where's the real magic? Where are the cataclysmic spells that take days or weeks of preparation, and then change the world with a single fateful ritual?\nThese games could learn something from The Last Spell, a roguelite turn-based tactics game about defending your village each night from hordes of mutant beasts that emerge from the purple fog surrounding the entire world. Whenever I start a new game in The Last Spell, I always rewatch the excellent opening sequence, which succinctly sets a harrowing scene of magic pushed further than we're used to seeing in most fiction in general, let alone games.\nRead more",

For six hours, you do this, and eat your dinner feeling sick with unrealised potential.\nMatch-3 games are compulsive for a reason, and I don't have beef with them as a concept. I actually like them! But I don't like that to play a match-3 game I usually have to play a mobile game that wants me to spent money on Fairy Dollars so I can buy barrels of Explosive Wand Dust, making it easier to earn stars and incrementally furnish the Magic Toilet Goblin's bedroom, or whatever. It's the empty consumerism vibe of freemium mobile games that makes me feel like I've been eating the time-spending equivalent of junk food.

I can't get enough of watching funny, smart, creative people work, and Double Fine Adventure offered a one-of-a-kind, candid and thorough glimpse of game development.\r\n\nIt was one-of-a-kind until yesterday, when Double Fine released PsychOdyssey, a 32-episode documentary series charting the creation of Psychonauts 2. Each episode is typically between 20 minutes and an hour long, and I've had a great time watching the first three so far.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It has a great premise, for starters - change history by meddling with your memories and playing out different versions of events to arrive at the 'correct' solution - and executes it brilliantly. Its GBA-style visuals and larger-than-life character portraits give it a real sense of charm and personality, and its mystery story of murder and corporate conspiracy had hooked me in real good. \nThen it abandoned its cool premise halfway through and became a different game entirely for its remaining run-time. I was heartbroken.\nRead more",

You move and jump, dodging spikes and lasers and ISO 13370 compliant death pits, and ideally collecting all the hard to reach thingies along the way.

Following comments from the publisher during an investor's call, Ubisoft has confirmed it will be in attendance at E3 2023.\nDuring an investor's call, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot responded to an inquiry on whether the company would be in attendance at this year's event. \"If E3 happens, we will be there and we will have a lot of things to show,\" said Guillemot at the time.\nIn a follow-up to GamesIndustry.biz, Ubisoft clarifies the wording:\n\"E3 is a special moment for our industry and we are excited to showcase our strong line-up in Los Angeles in June. We are still finalizing the details of our plans and look forward to sharing more soon.\"\n\nIt's a good clarification, at least, for those who may have thought E3 was changing things up once again following Guillemot's comment. ReedPop did reaffirm that E3 is \"full speed ahead\" after Guillemot's initial comment, but with this clarification, that's at least one company that looks set to show something in Los Angeles. [Disclosure: I was previously employed at USgamer, a former ReedPop website.]\nThe summer of games awaits\nQuestions of who's attending E3 2023 are still up in the air. An IGN report confirmed Sony, Nintendo, and Xbox wouldn't be on the show floor, though Microsoft is planning to host a summer showcase in Los Angeles.\nThe current plan has E3 2023 running from June 13 through 16 in Los Angeles, with both industry and consumer days planned.\nMeanwhile, Ubisoft says it is bringing a \"strong line-up\" to bear for its Los Angeles showing. The publisher has been on a bit of a roller-coaster, announcing a bevy of Assassin's Creed projects while also cancelling a number of unannounced projects and delaying Skull and Bones. It'll be interesting to see what it shows up with in June.\nThe post Ubisoft clarifies its E3 2023 plans appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Laser imaging, detection, and range\nSteelkrill Studios, the makers of lo-fi horror game The Backrooms 1998, have announced that they’ll be releasing The Voidness into the void of Early Access on March 17, 2023.\nThe Voidness is a unique horror game with an experimental twist. For much of the game, you’re immersed in complete darkness and are only able to perceive your surroundings with a lidar scanner. A lidar, or laser imaging, detection, and ranging scanner, is a device that uses lasers to create a constructive image of the area it’s pointed at. It has many uses, as it can create 3D maps of geographic locations and features.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/M66MeyC_gzA[/embed]\nFor The Voidness, however, lidar will be your only means of seeing what’s around you, and that includes anything that might be trying to eat you. The developer also touts that, like in The Backrooms 1998, enemies will listen in on your PC microphone. That sounds more like a feature utilized by streamers, as I don’t make it a habit of talking to my computer monitor. However, I’m always down for an experimental approach to game design.\nI haven’t personally played The Backrooms 1998, but I’ve seen it spoken of fondly in the indie horror circles I observe. It has also been picked up by popular streamers and has enjoyed it reasonable amount of success as a result. I might have to give it a good look-over once it leaves early access.

          "description": "MY FIGHT MONEEEEEEYYYY!!!\nAt the climax of this weekend's Capcom Cup, the last such tournament to be held on Street Fighter V, the publisher revealed that its next pro-season, Capcom Cup X, will have a $2 million USD prize pool, with the first crowned Street Fighter 6 champion walking away with a cool one million dollars.\nStreet Fighter 6, which launches on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms June 6, will be the exclusive game of Capcom Cup X, and will see players from all over the globe become literal World Warriors, catching flights to a wide variety of official tournaments in order to bag the CPT points necessary to make it to the grand finals — expected to be held in early 2024. The huge prize pool is expected to see many players, perhaps even retirees, dust off the arcade stick and go for their moment of glory.\nhttps://twitter.com/StreetFighter/status/1627566668821172224?s=20\nOf course, the promotion of such a lucrative tournament also works in Capcom's favor, as it keeps hype for the new sequel high, as well as encourages large turnouts at the many events that will be held all over the globe between Street Fighter 6's launch this summer and the ultimate showdown next year. Street Fighter 6, as I have iterated many a time, is already shaping up to be a fantastic release, one that hopes to see the brand reestablish itself as the competitive fighting game.\nMe?

          "description": "Wakarimashita\nThe fan group Team K4L have announced that their translation of Kurohyou: Ryu Ga Gotoku Shinshou will be released this August. Initially, they had hoped to release it last year, but unfortunately had to delay it.\nSega has come a long way when it comes to localizing their Yakuza/Like a Dragon series, so we’ve been eating well. Like a Dragon: Ishin! was once argued by Sega as being a poor choice for localization, but despite that, we just recently finally got it over here. However, in a recent interview with The Gamer chief producer Hiroyuki Sakamoto said of Kurohyou, “I think if we wanted to develop something, we're not really looking at the past, we're looking to the future, and we think that we want to put our efforts and our priorities at making new titles for Like a Dragon.” That’s not a “no, definitely not,” but it’s not looking good, so it’s always great to see fans step in to bring a title to a wider audience.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/dkkGKxAhNr0[/embed]\nKurohyou: Ryu Ga Gotoku Shinsho is a 2010 spin-off of the series for PSP. Rather than an attempt to simply transplant the Like a Dragon/Yakuza formula to the portable, Sega enlisted AKI Corporation (now known as syn Sophia) to put their own spin on it. AKI should be a familiar name to anyone who played N64 wrestling games, as they’re the developers behind WCW/NWO Revenge and WWF No Mercy. These titles, as well as the others they put out on the console, are still regarded as some of the best pro wrestling games ever released.\nThe gameplay focuses more on one-on-one combat, but the narrative features the familiar neighborhood of Kamurocho and is packed with mini-games and side quests. Combat is modeled closer to Def Jam Fight for NY, rather than the more beat-’em-up brawling of your typical Yakuza/Like a Dragon game.\nK4L will be releasing the translation patch this August under the name Kurohyou (Like a Dragon: Black Panther).\nThe post Kurohyou Like a Dragon: Black Panther fan translation coming in August appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It's been a year and a half since release\nIf you missed Monster Hunter Stories 2 when it came out in mid-2021, I don't blame you. There's a host of reasons why a lot of folks skipped out on it, but the good news is that Capcom is permanently reducing the price of the game: which will also impact the aftermarket.\nAnnounced openly on Twitter, Capcom had this to say:\n\"Ride on! Grab Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin for #NintendoSwitch and PC/Steam at a new price of $39.99. Start your journey today with the demo and transfer your progress over to the full game.\"\n\nThat price is already reflected in the digital edition of the game on both Switch and Steam. Note that there is a \"Digital Deluxe Edition\" though, which is now $50. The new $40 standard isn't present everywhere though, as a search through various digital storefronts came up with a $60 digital voucher code price. Keep that in mind if you're ever shopping for the game! It'll take a bit for everything to really sink in everywhere, but used copies are already dropping to $30 and below in some marketplaces (like Amazon).\nThere's also the chance that Monster Hunter Stories 2 will be part of the ever-present Capcom sale periods, so you could get it for even cheaper. In this economy, it goes without saying that we could use more price drops.\nThe post Monster Hunter Stories 2 is now officially $40, if you were on the fence appeared first on Destructoid.",

We won't be sharing any links or posting any of the leak here, though we've taken a look ourselves to verify its existence.\nWithout divulging any details, it does look like the art book for the upcoming Breath of the Wild sequel. And the nice part is, from a cursory scan, nothing jumped out as an obvious spoiler. Still, it's worth being aware that this info is out there, in case you want to go into Tears of the Kingdom as fresh as possible.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYZuiFDQwQw\nArt of the kingdom\nIt's especially interesting that an art book would leak so far ahead of the release date. We're still a ways out from Tears of the Kingdom's release date of May 12, 2023. This art book is part of what's included in the collector's edition of the game. It is strange that so much info would make it out from the book, three months ahead of time.\nStill, fans are likely hungry for more information, as it feels like we don't know a ton about this new Zelda. Points like the main antagonist, or the reason why Hyrule is now home to so many floating islands, are all still theories at this time. I'm sure fans are likely to pick this Zelda art book apart looking for any info on what could be arriving in May.\nIn the meantime, rev up those muted keywords and hashtags if you're looking to avoid all of it. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom arrives on May 12, 2023.\nRelated: Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom will be 38 percent bigger than BOTW as file size revealed on Dot Esports\nThe post Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom art book has leaked online appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Kiss the moons\nRoughly a year after launching Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition, Square-Enix has circled back to address some of its glaring issues with a patch this month. The patch is expected to address issues relating to the title's frame rate, tweak the growth system for Pip, and fix numerous bugs.\nChrono Cross was the anticipated sequel to the SNES classic, Chrono Trigger. It was extremely well-received at its time of release but has since developed a reputation as “not Chrono Trigger” (source: my old college friends). When Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition eventually hit the scene, I found the game to be decent, but not one of Square’s best PS1 titles.\n[embed]https://twitter.com/chronogame/status/1627595394946416640?s=20[/embed]\nThat’s fine. It’s still a worthwhile game, especially if you love Square’s PS1-era RPGs. This recent port, however, I found to be kind of stinky, although that’s not what I actually said. My sentiment was more along the lines that it was a barebones port that was serviceable but had framerate issues that made it feel like it failed to reach my bare minimum expectations. Hopefully, this patch will bring the port up to more acceptable standards.\nChrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition is available now on Switch, PS4, Xbox One, and PC.

The priority here is removing a bug that caused grasses to pop-in when Returnal is played on its \"Epic\" particle settings. This issue should now be resolved. Additionally, the new patch fixes a bug that was causing music to pause on rare occasions, along with auto-sync problems with certain resolutions.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKZV00Esu54&ab_channel=PlayStation\n\"We are honoured to have so many new players experiencing our dark, deep and beautiful action thriller, Returnal!\" reads a message accompanying the patch notes. \"Bringing Returnal to PC and capturing that PlayStation 5 experience took a lot of work and focus from the team at Climax Studios, with support from Housemarque and XDEV. We have been blown away and are so thankful for the amazing reviews, feedback and reports you have shared with us so far.\"\n\"We have continued to work on Returnal since launch, monitoring your feedback and will continue to work on patch updates to support the game ahead.\"\nReturnal, originally launched on PS5 in the spring of 2021, is a visually compelling shooter that tells the tale of a space explorer trapped in a time loop. The adrenaline-pumping adventure is renowned for its dazzling visual design, strong use of light and color, compelling challenge, and frantic, trigger-pumping action. The PC port is the latest in a series of PlayStation titles added to the desktop platform, such as God of War, Uncharted 4, Death Stranding, Marvel's Spider-Man, and Horizon Zero Dawn.\nThe post Returnal PC patch fixes pop-in grass and other bugs appeared first on Destructoid.",

While I could probably live without the censored content’s depictions of suicide, I definitely welcome the re-translated dialogue. Along with the translation comes standard features including like save states, retro screen filters, and unlockable cheats. You can also choose from arranged and original music, view production artwork, and check out an 80-page translated guide. Finally, they’ve included an interview with Satoshi Nakai.\nBut what you should be saying is, “Shhh… You had me at Assault Suit Valken is Cybernator.”\nInterestingly, what is shown in the trailer is a port of the SNES original rather than the 2005 PS2 remaster.

But the real story here is that the physical edition includes reversible box art. So what's on the reverse side? It's the Japanese box art for the game. Neat!

That thing is likely so far away that we could even see another 2D Metroid before it comes out.\nThat said, Nintendo has surprised us before.

Atomic Heart is the debut title from developer Mundfish, who, in recent weeks, has come under pressure to be more transparent over its ties to Russia. According to a Eurogamer article, which goes into far more detail on the matter than I will here, Mundfish's investor is the Russian firm GEM Capital, which is run by Anatoliy Paliy, who used to work for the state-owned Gazprom. The developer bills itself as a multinational developer with team members in 10 different countries, including Poland, Ukraine, and the United Arab Emirates. However, the original development team was based in Russia, and Russian-state media has referred to the studio as Russian in reports on the game.\nWi…",

The grim 'n' gothic sequel is currently scheduled to launch June 6 on PC and consoles.\nThe beta, confirmed during this weekend's IGN Fan Fest, will be live across all platforms and will allow players to battle through most of the sequel's first act, set within the locale of \"Fractured Peaks\". All character classes are available to play up to a level cap of 25, and most of the main quests and side objectives will be included in the beta. It sounds similar to the beta test for Diablo III, which was held back in the spring of 2012 and offered up the same experience and limitations.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nhu26227MD4&ab_channel=Diablo\nPlayers who pre-order Diablo IV will receive early access to the beta for the weekend of March 17-19. The beta will be fully opened up to the public on the following weekend, March 24-26. Progress from the closed beta will carry through to the open beta. You can check out full details on what to expect from this trial over on the official Blizzard website. Additionally, the publisher released the cinematic intro movie for the sequel, which you can check out above.\nDiablo IV launches June 6 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post Diablo IV beta tests scheduled for late-March appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "I feel charcoal is a perfectly valid medium\nFreedom Games has announced that 9 Years of Shadows, the musical Metroidvania from developer Halberd Studios, will arrive on March 27, 2023.\nWhile, on the surface, 9 Years of Shadows looks like a pretty close follower of a particular 1997 Castlevania title, it has some unique wrinkles to make it more than another gated exploration title. Appropriately taking place after the world has spent the aforementioned nine years in darkness, you play as Europa, who refuses to let that timespan build into a full decade. Bringing with her a “healing teddy bear,” she sets off to the cursed Castle Talos to try and bring color back into the world.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/XIm-ss9L3pA[/embed]\nMusic will play an important role in the narrative. Some bosses wield “musical attack patterns.” Serving as guest composers are Metal Gear Solid veteran Norihiko Hibino and Iga-era Castlevania fixture Michiru Yamane. On top of contributing to the soundtrack of 9 Years of Shadows, these two absolute legends will make appearances within the game as NPCs. Damn.\nThe Symphony of the Night corner of the indie marketplace is a rather crowded one these days, but I’m rather stricken by the colorful pixel art that 9 Years of Shadow is showing off. It reminds me of the way Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance used bright colors to appear more visible on the Game Boy Advance’s light-hungry screen. I sometimes feel like I’ve had my fill of gated exploration titles, but they more often resemble pickles; I always seem to have room for one more.\n9 Years of Shadows will be available on PC via Steam and Epic Game Store on March 27. A Switch version is in the works and will drop in the third quarter of 2023.\nThe post 9 Years of Shadows envelopes March 27 appeared first on Destructoid.",

This is why I do not say lightly that all my lists to this point pale in comparison to the difficulty of ranking the best SNES games.\nLord Spencer elegantly described my 10 best Mario games list as “a list of nines rolling into tens.” As I jotted down my picks for this list, I realized they were all potentially tens.

Essentially a futuristic version of the golden age Atari game, Combat, Grobda sees players control the titular tank against a battalion of enemies in top-down, maze-driven action. The player must utilize the Grobda's laser weaponry to destroy their opponents while dodging return fire across a gauntlet of 99 stages.\nCheck out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Old Classic Retro Gaming.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAXdlXLPlRQ&ab_channel=OldClassicRetroGaming\nHaving launched just on the verge of the Video Game Crash, Grobda would swiftly vanish into the void, though home versions were developed for Japanese platforms such as the Sharp X1 and the NEC PC-6001. Grobda development team featured some notable Namco luminaries, including Tower of Druaga designer Masanobu Endo, and Dig Dug composer Yuriko Keino. Always a pioneer, Keino devised a mechanic that allowed Grobda to speed up her score as the action heated up, a fun little gimmick for the time. Development was smashed out in a mere three months from conception to release. Wild days.\nGrobda is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nThe post Namco’s obscure tank battler Grobda rolls into the Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "They think we know nothing\nSurvival town-builder Outlanders is the latest game that will be leaving Apple Arcade to plant roots on new platformers. Pomelo Games' builder is dropping on March 7, 2023.\nFirst released on the iOS Apple Arcade in 2019, Outlanders is a survival town-builder, a genre that has been growing in popularity since Shining Rock Software’s 2014 hit, Banished. Since then, the formula has been expanded by games like Frostpunk and Settlement Survival. The focus of these games is on resource management, as your townsfolk suffer from a fatal condition known as mortality. Fail to keep them fed and healthy, and they will succumb to their diseases.\n[embed]https://youtu.be/HGWqZ6mp-lo[/embed]\nOutlanders attempts a more relaxed approach, but you’ll still be tasked with filling hungry bellies. It has a narrative campaign that has you follow the paths of various leaders. There is no combat, but the media around it shows construction near a volcano. Like other games in the series, you manage the workload of the town’s inhabitants, and you can pass decrees to work the ungrateful peons to an early grave. Improvements have been made to the UI and graphics to make it better suited to the good old mouse and keyboard setup. A sandbox mode will also be available if you do better without having to worry about goals or expectations.\nOutlanders is currently available on iOS via Apple Arcade, and will be coming to PC on March 7, 2023. There is currently a PC demo available on Steam if you want to kick the tires.\nThe post Outlanders lays its foundations on PC March 7 appeared first on Destructoid.",

A new story trailer introduces a seemingly villainous character, Simon, while highlighting some of the dangerous monstrosities waiting to dismantle players. \nLies of P unfolds in the fictional, Belle Époque-era French city of Krat as players control Pinocchio, a mechanoid puppet on a quest to become human. A certain Mr. Geppetto might be able to help with that, but Krat has been overtaken by sinister creatures Pinocchio must cut down using his multi-purpose mechanical arm. \n\n\nThe gameplay takes heavy cues from From Software’s work – Bloodborne in particular – as players take down enemies with deliberate sword attacks, while various mechanical arms grant abilities like firing lightning bolts or a grappling hook to reel in targets. Outside of battles, sidequests present the option of lying to characters, and the truthfulness of your answers alters the direction of these stories. \nLies of P will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass), and PC. You can learn more by reading our hands-on preview from last year’s Gamescom.",

The trailer then showcases how Taron Egerton's character is deadset on bringing Tetris to everybody after playing it once.

          "description": "Marvel’s Midnight Suns gets its second story expansion next week in the form of the aptly titled “Redemption.” It stars Venom, looking to right the wrongs he’s committed, but he’s going to have to overcome the powerful demon Mephisto to do it. \nThe trailer shows Eddie Brock, having recovered from the events of the main campaign, making a deal with Mephisto to help rid himself of his darkness. Naturally, this goes about as well as you would expect, leading to Venom joining the Midnight Suns as a playable character to battle this formidable demonic threat. \n\n\nRedemption will be available on February 23. It comes included with the game's season pass. Firaxis' role-playing strategy take on the Marvel universe has already received DLC in the form of a Deadpool character and mission pack. Despite the game receiving positive reviews (including cracking Game Informer’s Top 10 Games of 2022), it was recently revealed to have underperformed in sales.",

As horrific as the game looks, it's the soundtrack and creepy sound effects that do much of the heavy lifting in building fear and tension. To understand how the remake remixes and enhances the original game's soundscape, I picked the brains of RE4 sound director Hiroshi Tamura and lead composer Kota Suzuki to learn how they're making the game sound as good as it plays. \nGame Informer: A goal for the Resident Evil 4 remake is to create more believable soundscapes.

The original PlayStation VR, from the outside at least, seemed like a moderate success for Sony. It was a functional VR alternative for players who were not interested in entering the world of PC gaming and it had at least one undeniable, exclusive hit with Astro Bot Rescue Mission.\nPlayStation VR2 is the next logical step for the sub-platform. It works with Sony’s latest hardware, it improves on basically every aspect of PlayStation VR, but it’s not quite the virtual reality revolution I feel like we’ve been waiting for since the advent of the medium.\nThe Setup\nEvery virtual realit…",

Two of these titles, Song of Nunu and Convergence, had been previously announced, while the third game, The Mageseeker, makes it debut. \n\n\nThe Mageseeker is set to arrive first sometime this spring. Developed by Digital Sun, the team behind Moonlighter, it’s described as a gritty 2D action RPG. It stars Sylas and takes place in Demacia. You can find The Mageseeker on PC and unspecified consoles. \nConvergence launches this summer and was first revealed at The Game Awards in 2019. Starring Ekko, it’s a 2D action-platforming adventure by Double Stallion that features parkour and time-manipulation mechanics. Convergence launches for PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam and Epic. \nSong of Nunu closes out the year. Releasing this fall, it centers on the young Nunu and his yeti partner Willump on a search to find Nunu’s mother. The charming adventure game focuses on the pair working together to solve environmental puzzles. Song of Nunu comes from the folks at Tequila Works, the developer of titles such as Rime and Gylt, and it will be available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, Switch, and PC via Steam and Epic. \nRiot released its first League of Legends spin-off Ruined King in 2021 to generally positive reviews, so we're curious to see how these other projects fair and if they'll attract new, non-MOBA fans coming off Netflix's well-received Arcane series. Which League of Legends title are you most interested in?

Movie to the next level by launching a website and commercial promoting the brothers’ New York City plumbing business, and it's actually pretty cool. \nYou can visit the website here, which features a commercial promoting the Mario Bros. business. Older fans will likely recognize the catchy jingle as the theme song of the 1989 Super Mario Brothers Super Show, which is a nice homage. \n\n\nThe website also features humorous testimonials, job opportunities, and even a working phone number. Calling this number (929-55-MARIO) plays a recorded message by the Charlie Day-voiced Luigi, which provides a nice sample of his performance as the green-glad sidekick. Texting the number returns a message, which, depending on when you sent it, may return a digital poster for the movie. GI editor Kyle Hilliard got this Toad poster when he texted the number yesterday:\nIn my case, I only got a message thanking me for my interest in Super Mario Bros. Plumbing with a link to a form submission on the website. I'm not sure what you get for submitting this form, but feel free to find out yourselves. \nThe Super Mario Bros.

Rarely do driving games force a first-person view, and even fewer deviate from being a racer. \nPacific Drive does both, and after viewing roughly 30 minutes of gameplay during a virtual preview, I’m even more intrigued.

During today's Nintendo Direct, we got a new look at gameplay, plus the announcement of the Collector's Edition and a new Amiibo figure starring Link. However, we also got some unfortunate news surrounding the upcoming launch of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.\nIn its press release for the Nintendo Direct, Nintendo announced that the upcoming Zelda entry will retail for $69.99. This makes Nintendo the latest major publish to test the waters of raising the price of its triple-A titles in recent years. This follows other major publishers like 2K Games and PlayStation, who started pricing their major releases at $70 with the start of the new console generation in 2020. Last year, both Xbox and Ubisoft announced that their triple-A games would cost $70 going forward.\nWe reached out to Nintendo for comment regarding the reasoning for the price increase and if this will be the trend for its triple-A releases going forward, but did not immediately receive a response. We will update this story if Nintendo provides a statement.\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom launches on Switch on May 12.",

          "description": "A few months have passed since we released ScummVM 2.6.1. It's time to prepare for a new release!\nOur lovely developers added support, yet again, for a bunch of new ancient games that require testing:\nSoldier Boyz\nGLK Scott Adams Interactive Fiction games (C64 and ZX Spectrum)\nGLK Scott Adams adventures 1-12 (TI99/4A format)\nObsidian\nPink Panther: Passport to Peril\nPink Panther: Hokus Pokus Pink\nDriller/Space Station Oblivion\nHalls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II\nBesides these games, we’d appreciate it if you could check our release testing list. Maybe you’ll even find your favorite game on there that has been sitting on that shelf for way too long - otherwise, there are some demos of these games available on our website.\nAnd since ScummVM is about playing games in general, we’ve seen notable changes across many, many engines - so this is the perfect time for giving your favorites another go.\nAs usual, we are not just adding support for new games. We are constantly working on improving the engines we already support and, in particular, we’ve seen some incredible work being done on the SCUMM engine. Yes, there are the usual bug fixes, but this time we are also adding a feature that helps playing the SCUMM games in a truly original fashion: Support for the original loading and saving dialogs within the GUI!\nSpeaking of truly original: Remember those old CRT displays we had back in the day? With ScummVM 2.7.0 you’ll be able to replicate this experience on certain platforms thanks to our new shader-based scalers. Go ahead and give it a try!\nAll testing must be done with stable builds, not development ones. Please report any bugs or oddities on our issue tracker.\nA detailed list of all exciting new features and fixes is available in our NEWS file.\nThank you very much for your support! Let’s make ScummVM 2.7.0 a great release - together!\n>",

Depending on your perspective, we’re either two months early for our usual April 1st release, or a bit tardy for the Christmas 2022 release we intended. We think the wait has been worth it. This is one of the largest releases we’ve done in several years, with numerous features and improvements covering the user interface, gameplay features, and modding extensions for NewGRF and Game Script creators. Some of the highlights are: Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. This includes better automatic scaling when using HiDPI or mixed DPI setups. Direct access to NewGRF/AI/GS settings from the new game window. Various small tweaks and improvements to several windows. NewGRFs can now provide engine variants that are shown hierarchically in the purchase list. Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing. Custom league tables for GameScripts. More natural rivers which get wider as they flow downstream. And much more, which can be seen in the changelog or the previous release announcements! In addition to these features and improvements, we’ve fixed lots of bugs. (If you played with the RC2 testing release, most were fixed before then. See the changelog for full details.)
