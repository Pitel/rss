Sure, we've seen a few usual suspects already - Deus Ex Mankind Divided, Disco Elysium, even Else: Heart.Break - they all grimace in the line-up but nothing ever sticks. Now, out of the gloom of indie development, comes another perp ready to have his mugshot taken. Shadows Of Doubt is an open world detective sim that comes perilously close to being our guy. Its clothes, stature, gait, and fingerprints match the description of what Spector often describes. And yet, if you tilt your head, something is just a little off. The game isn't confined to one block. It's not an RPG precisely. And its simulation has plenty of bugs, jank, and unintentional comedy. But after all this time, in the absence of a smoking gun, shouldn't we just put this guy in the slammer and call the case closed? I say yes, let's. Officers!

As a heartless individual, I am more concerned with whatever the dog's capable of: general savagery, a howl that replenishes my HP bar, letting me climb atop its glorious mane as it strides across the barren wastes. If it's none of these things, I would much rather have a shiny turret on spindly steel legs skitter besides me.\nNomada Studios have, incredibly, thrust their hands into my chest cavity and given me a blood-pumping mechanism. Having spent some time with upcoming action-platformer Neva (the game) and Neva (the dog from the game), I have to admit: I did enjoy petting Neva (the dog).\nRead more",

Near Mint is a roguelike deckbuilder where you advance through a tower fighting slightly stronger iterations of the exact same skeleton. Ok, nothing too captivating so far. The twist comes from the cards: someone’s left them in their Oodie pouch, spilt BBQ sauce down it, then stuck it in the wash before taking the deck out. Now, all the cards have split apart into three pieces. It’s name-your-own-price on Itch here, and it’ll only take you a couple minutes to get acquainted, but I’ll explain the gist below.

It’s hard not to be moved by the exaggerated kineticism of it all – the magic-enhanced swordfights, the jumping off cliffs and turning into a flying shadow monster, the ability to drift horses. Yes. Yes!\nI’m therefore somewhat unnerved to report that my enthusiasm has been tempered significantly by actually playing it. I’ve since used all the straws I’ve clutched at to spell out \"It’s just a demo\" on my floor, but the fear remains that Crimson Desert’s fantastical open-world exploration is going to be interrupted by regular bouts of twangy, unwieldy, unsatisfying combat.\nRead more",

          "description": "Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a remaster of Disney Epic Mickey, a cult classic 3D platformer first released a decade ago on the Wii. In the original you controlled the titular Mickey Mouse who, armed with a magical paintbrush (wieldable by waving the Wiimote about), could paint or rub out surfaces to solve puzzles. It was the work of Junction Studios led by Warren Spector, best known for being The Deus Ex Guy. No, sadly Mickey could not nano-augment his brush for better target acquisition, nor project laser-guided anti-tank rockets from his podgy white mitts.\nAnd no, Rebrushed doesn't let him do anything of these either. Clearly a missed opportunity. But is it better nonetheless? With an updated look, some added secrets, more moves for Mickey, and controller/M&K support, I'd say longtime Mickey heads will adore this nostalgia trip. For total newcomers like me, I'd say it's a platformer that's certainly charming and clever and wonderfully experimental, but a bit flat in places too.\nRead more",

You can do that anywhere.”\nA QA tester with Zenimax currently on union leave, Mitchell joined the Communications Workers Of America (CWA) as a full-time organiser after she and her colleagues formed what was, at the time, the biggest union in videogames - ZeniMax Workers United.

Sadly, it’s still no first-rate adaptation, neglecting numerous PC features and giving low-end systems an even deeper kick in the plums. Cutting the quality settings can help, as per the guide down below, but overall performance is so up-and-down than you’ll likely never achieve a perfectly smooth ride.\nRead more",

Then I hit some puzzles and thought, \"Ain't no kid figuring this out\".\nThen it hit me. It struggles to balance the fine line between being approachable for tiny tots and layered enough for people who've graduated from \"goo goo ga ga\" to \"oo oo aa aa my back hurts\".

          "description": "Why is every blockbuster video game now some kind of live service game? Speaking as a clueless idiot, the explanation I find most convincing is that it's an attempt to bridge the gap between the returns publishers want from video games, versus how much we're able or willing to pay upfront. \"Triple-A\" projects now cost exorbitant sums to develop, partly thanks to wider economic inflation, but also because publishers have spent decades teaching players that every sequel has to be More and Shinier. Premium game prices have not risen in proportion, and investors want growth, as they do.\nLive service games sneak around this difficulty by dragging out the time we spend playing them. Whether premium or free-to-play, they seek to install themselves as habits by means of regular, planned updates and additions. This is time that can be monetised by way of a subscription model, time in which other products may be sold to you, like skins and paintjobs, and time that becomes a commodity in itself, \"engagement\", which can be transmuted and exploited to various end. I'm not sure it's ever been expressed this way in any press release boast about longevity, but the unspoken principle/logical extrapolation seems to be that ideally, a live service game should keep us plugged in and plugging away till we die.\n Read more",

          "description": "Strange Scaffold’s newly released FPS I Am Your Beast is very fun for quite a few reasons, but chief among them is a deep appreciation for the poetry of good videogame violence. I’m not using the big P word just to throw out an overly worthy comparison to something we might associate with craft or beauty, but as a nod toward the game’s playful application of what I previously called ‘a euphoric splurge of murderous game verbiage’ one morning where I had clearly eaten my wordy Weetabix. The way its hurled knives and curb stomps and inexplicable decapitations flow together have an assonant, almost Suessian quality to them.\nBut it’s also, well, just a bit like Mad Libs. You play as Harding, a man who’s mythical lethality is established very early on. The showing is there in the moment to moment, but the telling is conveyed through cute tricks like how everyone you meet is so deeply afraid of Harding that they loudly keep track of exactly what weapon he’s holding at all times. The Mad Libs comes in through the fact that you can draw Harding a route between A and B, and it’s a given that multiple heads are going to come unstuck from necks along the way.

          "description": "In theory, vampires and immersive sims go together as naturally as bats and caves. Immersive sims tend to involve a balance of stealth, acrobatics, raw strength and crafty manipulation, and vampires are celebrated for all of these things. Despite this, actual vampire-themed immersive sims are rare. My list starts with Vampire: the Masquerade: Bloodlines... and sort of ends there. In a devastating betrayal, Arkane Austin's Redfall wasn't an immersive sim but an open world co-op shooter (a not very good one). The much-delayed Bloodlines 2 was recently downgraded from immersive sim to RPG by new developers The Chinese Room. Arkane Lyon's Blade adaptation seems promising, but it's a ways off. \r\n\n\r\nHere to paper over the immersive vamping gap in the market is Byte Barrel's Trust, \"a new first-person shooter with immersive sim elements\". It takes place in a world where the vampires are hunted for their blood, which has become an everyday human energy source, used for everything from car batteries to streetlights. The irony! I feel like, in the circumstances, the ideal solution would be for humans to let vampires suck their blood in return for vampires letting humans use their blood for electricity, but that wouldn't make for a very thrilling shooter. Anyway, here's the trailer.\r\n \nRead more",

It uses a square aspect display ratio calibrated to give wizened Game Boy enthusiasts the shakes, and is made up of 200 single-screen rooms that \"slot into the larger puzzle-box of the world\".

Reminds me of a Regina Spektor lyric: \"Leaves become most beautiful when they're about to die\". And now, inevitably whatever I write below this will be a lie, because I'll actually spend my weekend listening to old Regina Spektor songs, because she's just the best.\nBut for now at least, let's keep up the pretense that we're not all lying through our teeth every weekend with these posts.

You get a Diablo-ish combat system, the ability to shapeshift into a spider, and a whole castle to prance around in, crooning at the moon. I like this premise almost as much as I dislike the fact that V Rising is also a survival game, in which you must fell trees and master a crafting system like a common turnip farmer.\r\n\n\r\nWhat do we hope for when our interest in a game is almost perfectly balanced by our disinterest? We hope that the developers will treat us to a free-to-play weekend, in which our perhaps-unfounded reservations might be strategically offset by the endorphin rush of not having paid any goddamn money. This, V Rising creators Stunlock have now done. The game is free to download and play on Steam from right now until Monday, 16th September at 5pm UK or 10am PST.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Thankfully, your progress from the Prologue Demo will transfer to the full release of the game.\n\n\nIt appears the demo is pretty meaty, featuring the RPG's first four dungeons, seven of the over 40 classes, also known as Archetypes and six of the followers that accompany the Protagonist by joining your party.\n\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with Metaphor, think Shin Megami Tensei or Persona set in a new medieval fantasy world that mirrors the contemporary real world. With beautiful landscapes and stylish anime cutscenes, not to mention the same lengthy expansive story that Atlus fans have come to expect from their RPGs. I don't have the time, but screw it I'll find time for this one.\n\n\nI normally don't bother with demos unless I'm really on the fence about a game, mostly just due to time constraints. But for Metaphor: ReFantazio where I already know I'm going to get it, AND the demo progress carries over to full launch, this is like an early Christmas.\n\n\nThose interested in checking out the demo now can do so on your respective platform. Metaphor: ReFantazio is set to launch on October 11.\n\nThe post Metaphor: ReFantazio massive five hour Prologue Demo out now appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Mörk Borg is spreading its dark tendrils off the tabletop and onto Steam. Originally released in 2020 by Free League Publishing, Mörk Borg has been the undisputed, award-winning breakout hit from the Old School Renaissance world of game design. The tabletop role-playing game strips back the d20 ruleset to its most deadly and fill the empty space with bright and harrowing death metal-inspired art, equal parts vicious and colorful, like its mechanics. \n\n\nOn September 24th, indie game designer Morbidware announced that they were working on a new video game inspired by Mörk Borg's world, deadliness, and art design. The game is called Mörk Borg Heresy Supreme. The game is a 2D action sidescroller, and the Steam page makes its dark promises of death with a \"Roguelike\" tag. From what very little of the game we have seen so far, it resembles its peers like Blasphemous and Corpse Keeper.\n\n\nMork Borg Heresy Supreme via Morbidware.\n\n\nMörk Borg Heresy Supreme vows not to forget its OSR roots, featuring RPG elements in the form of stats and rolled skill checks. As the Steam page threatens, \"You should always put your life in the hands of a die roll. That's why it's called a die roll.\" In many ways, the game promises a mix of gory gorgeousness and the knowledge that you will churn through many, many characters before you finally reach the end of its pitch-black apocalypse. \n\n\nMordbidware's previous game was The Textorcist, an exorcism-based bullet hell typing game, which only makes this partnership with Mörk Borg make more sense as I say it. Mörk Borg Heresy Supreme announced a Kickstarter to fund this new digital vision of their surreal hellscape. The Kickstarter goes live on October 1, and the game is said to be released in late 2025.\n\n\nThe tabletop game advises you to burn your book; I suppose now we should burn our PCs too. I just hope they've kept the femur club. \n\nThe post Mörk Borg is bringing its death metal vibes to your PC. appeared first on Destructoid.",

Once that is done, it will cost a total of 820 Star Coins.

          "description": "The latest Slayer's Corp update for Anime Vanguards added a handful of cool new items, including the Fortune Catalyst (Slayer) item. However, you'll need to know exactly how to get your hands on it as it doesn't use the previous Gold or Gems currency. Here is how to get the Fortune Catalyst in Anime Vanguards and what you can do with it.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nHow to get the Fortune Catalyst\n\n\nYou can get the Fortune Catalyst (Slayer) item in Anime Vangurds buy purchasing it from the new Raid Shop NPC, Renguko, located in the Raid Wing from the main hub. You will need to purchase the Fortune Catalyst for either 400 Red Webs, which is easily farmable, or by spending 199 Robux. If you need more Red Webs, you can get them by completing the new Spider Forest raid that was introduced in the 0.5 update.\n\n\nIn total you can purchase up to 999 of the Fortune Catalyst item, as it is a consumable that only lasts a limited time. To buy more than one, simply revisit the Renguko NPC and buy them.\n\n\nWhat does the Fortune Catalyst (Slayer) do?\n\n\nThe Fortune Catalyst item currently in Anime Vanguards will increase the chance of acquiring the secret exclusive Renguko unit when completing the final act of the Spider Forest raid. By default, you have a 1% chance of getting Renguko every time you complete the stage. If you consume a Fortune Catalyst item it will double that to a 2% chance. This may seem minor, but think about it this way: if on average it will take you 100 completions to get Renguko, but you can cut that down to 50 completions, isn't it worthwhile?\n\n\nThe only negative is that each time you consume your Fortune Catalyst, it is used up, and only lasts for one completion. Therefore, you will need quite a lot of Red Webs if you want to effectively farm out Renguko using Fortune Catalysts every time.\n\nThe post How to get and use the Fortune Catalyst in Anime Vanguards appeared first on Destructoid.",

Here's when to expect Burnice White to release in Zenless Zone Zero.\n\n\nWhen does Burnice White come out in Zenless Zone Zero?\n\n\nBased on the Version 1.2 Special Program, Burnice White will be released on Oct. 16, 2024, during the second half of the ZZZ update launch. If you tune into the new Tour de Inferno Chapter, you'll get a sneak peek of her energetic personality and explosive abilities.

Nonetheless, you can get creative with male model outfits and still reach the top spot on a round's pedestal if your clothes fit the theme.\n\n\nHow to swap to male and female body types in Dress to Impress\n\n\nYou can switch between male and female model types using the mannequins in the Dress to Impress dressing room. Once you spawn in, turn toward the area next to the VIP room to find two statues on the back wall. Using a gender mannequin resets your character, so make sure you do this early in the round so you have time to dress yourself up.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nOnce you use a male or female mannequin, you'll take on the body type shown in the preview and reset your character. Doing this also removes any makeup, clothes, and hairstyles you have on, restricting you to masculine-styled options. In short, you won't be able to wear any dresses or have flowing long hair as a boy in Dress to Impress.\n\n\nAdmittedly, there are fewer options for male characters than for females. Most of the male-specific outfits also have fits for girls, giving you the freedom to use a more androgynous if you want to keep a feminine body shape. Otherwise, swapping over gives you a noticeably larger body shape and height and more defined muscles that can help make certain outfits stand out more.\n\n\nDespite these restrictions, guys have their unique hairstyles and masculine facial features that females can't use, which can help spice things up a bit. They also get six-pack abs, which is always a fun bonus. There's no right or wrong answer when it comes to Dress to Impress, especially with how open-ended most themes are.\n\nThe post How to change to a male model in Dress to Impress Roblox appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Destiny 2 is no stranger to having a ton of different currencies to keep track of. I still hold onto a few random things like Gunsmith Materials myself, even if I'll never use them. It's the way of any RPG, realistically.\n\n\nOne such resource that's highly valued is Strange Coins, seeing as they are the main currency for a weekly vendor. Here's how to get Strange Coins in Destiny 2.\n\n\nWhere to get Strange Coins in Destiny 2\n\n\nImage via Destructoid.\n\n\nStrange Coins can be earned when completing any ritual activity in the game. These include anything from the Vanguard, Crucible, and Gambit sections at the top of the Destinations screen. As for which can give you more, you'll likely see more success when completing random strikes or Onslaught, but you might have more fun with Crucible or Gambit if you're a bigger fan of PvP.\n\n\nIf you're no longer earning Strange Coins, you've likely hit the maximum amount of 99. This means you'll either need to delete your current Strange Coins (which would be silly) or spend them to earn more.\n\n\nWhat can you use Strange Coins for?\n\n\nStrange Coins are used with Xur, who comes to the Tower every Friday until the next weekly reset on Tuesday. His offers include various exotic items, different legendary weapons or armor with specific rolls, and Exotic Ciphers, which can be used to buy Exotic items from Master Rahool or the Monument to Lost Lights. If you're a veteran player, you'll likely want to spend your Strange Coins on an exotic class item roll so you can complete your collection.\n\nThe post How to get Strange Coins in Destiny 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "It's time to celebrate Fortnite's seventh birthday by opening gifts, collecting medallions, and flying around the map with balloons. There are also quests involving obtaining these items, but finding a birthday medallion is more challenging than you'd expect unless you get your hands on some birthday presents.\n\n\nWhere to find a Birthday Medallion in Fortnite\n\n\nThe easiest way to find a birthday medallion in Fortnite is to open a birthday present. From September 24 until October 1, birthday presents will spawn on the floor or in chests as legendary-tier items that you can pick up and throw to the ground. Each birthday present has a medallion inside alongside an epic or legendary-grade item. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nThe downside is that birthday presents have random spawns around the map. You can find them on the floor in any POI or within treasure chests, but there's no guarantee you'll spot one throughout your match, even if you survive until the end.\n\n\nHow to use a Birthday Medallion in Fortnite\n\n\nBirthday medallions are different from regular boss ones, as they don't directly buff your character or reveal your location. Instead, they periodically spawn balloons on your back, allowing you to hover in the air when you jump. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nYou can have up to three balloons on your back at a time, letting you fly in the air until you or another player pops them. Their strength depends on how many you have, so you can wait until more spawn or release a few if their hover power is too much to handle.\n\n\nHow to use balloons\n\n\nAs balloons appear on your back with a Birthday medallion, you can jump to let them boost your height, release them to reduce their effects or pop them if you want to sabotage others. If you have the Birthday medallion equipped, you'll automatically spawn balloons on your back over time until you're eliminated.\n\nThe post How to find a Birthday Medallion in Fortnite appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "God Of War Ragnarok's PC port followed Sony's largely disliked strategy of requiring players to already have or create a PSN account to link to Steam in order to run. Luckily, we just learned from VGC modder iArtorias came to the rescue by creating a mod called NoPSSDK. It adds a small library that strips the game of its unnecessary PSN requirement.\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot via iArtorias\n\n\nSony's strategy could, on paper, make sense for multiplayer games. Still, this measure proved disastrous as it caused Helldivers 2 to lose a devastating amount of players who lived in areas not covered by the PSN's reach. Sony ended up reverting that decision, but a lot of damage had already been done to the confidence we all had in Sony. Concord might have sadly been doomed from the start, but it also had this feature whose innate cumbersomeness certainly didn't help it gain any favor among PC-only players.\n\n\nThis is an especially strange move since we're talking about a single-player experience. Ghost Of Tsushima, the other big PlayStation title recently released on PC, didn't feature this requirement and did just fine. At a time when even EA is starting to let its upcoming big releases roam free on Steam, Sony should totally be taking the hint.\n\n\nThe mod has only been out for a few hours, but it has already been downloaded over two thousand times, in case you're wondering how much everyone dislikes this feature. \n\n\nYou can now play God Of War Ragnarok on PlayStation 5, and on PC via Steam, and you can download iArtorias' quality of life improvement mod right here at Nexusmods.\n\nThe post God of War Ragnarok mod fixes the dumb PSN requirement from PC version appeared first on Destructoid.",

As part of the BeStreamWise anti-piracy campaign, would-be pirates on X and Reddit were reportedly gifted a link to a stream, but not of the match. The replacement featured a real stream made entirely of water, protecting the viewer from malware and potentially curing them of piracy forever. For those who missed out, there are other things to try.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",
