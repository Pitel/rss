          "description": "\"With 3DS, we did not let the poor sales performance linger\".\nWhen the 3DS launched it had a tough task as the successor to DS, a portable family of systems that had become Nintendo's greatest success story. Though the 3DS (and 2DS) range of systems couldn't hit those heights, by the end of its run it had been a reasonable success with 75.94 million hardware units shipped.\nIf you cast your mind back to its launch, however, it could have been very different. After a strong initial month as eager fans snapped up systems, sales of the original 3DS dramatically collapsed. As Reggie Fils-Aimé explains in his book, Disrupting the Game, From the Bronx to the Top of Nintendo, this put the company under huge pressure. In some territories, it's explained that Nintendo was hit with requests to take back swathes of inventory that couldn't be sold, a process that would have been disastrous at the time. It was this, in part, that led to the extraordinary price-drop within months of the system's launch.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

After the success of the RG351 (which spawned the excellent RG351V), the RG300X and more recent RG552 have perhaps been a little disappointing, and fans are still waiting for a 'true' next-gen handheld from the company.\nThe $140 Anbernic RG503 isn't that device, and we dare say that it will displease many people as a result. However, in many ways it represents a significant step up for the company and handheld emulation devices in general; it's the first product of this type to boast an OLED panel (made by Samsung, in this case) and also packs in 5GHz Wi-Fi as well; it's also the first Anbernic handheld to be powered by the new Rockchip RK3566 processor.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

But you won't always be right.\".\nThis week has brought the launch of Disrupting the Game, From the Bronx to the Top of Nintendo by Reggie Fils-Aimé, a business leadership book from the former Nintendo of America President that offers plenty of interesting insights. While it's selective and careful about detail it gives around Nintendo's operations, one theme that develops nicely in the book is the evolving relationship between Fils-Aimé and the late Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata.\nIwata-san was hugely respected, of course, and 2021's Iwata Asks book is well worth a look for direct insights from his career. In Fils-Aimé's case we see the influence that Iwata-san had on his approach to business, and indeed to life more broadly. It is clear that a strong friendship formed, as outlined in very touching early sections outlining visits to see Iwata-san when he was ill and recovering in hospital, for example.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Relying on RGB output was arguably the most sensible way of extracting the best possible picture from your consoles in the CRT-filled '90s, but that isn't always the case now (in fact, many modern TV sets have removed connections like SCART entirely, and those that do have them rarely handle the analogue signal well).\nThis has opened up the door for a wide range of AV solutions for retro gamers, including upscalers like the OSSC, RetroTINK2x and Framemeister (which, on a basic level, take the analogue signal and turn it into something your modern TV can play nicely with, and they do a pretty amazing job) as well as cheaper, 'plug and play' cable options – most of which have historically offered less-than-stellar results.

Same! combines an early Toaplan series of two: Hishouzame and Same! Same! Same!, known in the West as Flying Shark and Fire Shark, respectively. Both original arcade titles are presented here with a variety of modes, correctly maintained aspect ratios, screen settings, and a library of bonus features and options to tinker with. Regional variations are also present, since they have slight alterations in overall difficulty. After an initially long load, the opening menu screen blasts you like a Van Halen power ballad with a terrific arrange of Flying Shark’s ‘Against The Attack’ — regrettably unavailable as an in-game audio option.\nFlying Shark (1987) and its sequel, Fire Shark (1989), are quasi-World War themed shoot-em-ups, sending up biplanes with hefty ordnance against futuristic, cannon-bristled tanks, battleship-patrolled seas, enemy bases and muted mountain ranges. Graphically, these titles are a product of their time, and all the more endearing for it, peppered with land-based details like runway strip airmen pointing you to glory, or the trailing plane that crashes on take-off, its pilot lying inert in a smouldering pit.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

The family-friendly game launched last week, and players have been getting together to try the game both offline and online.\nHowever, the online mode might not be quite as family-friendly as people were expecting. Players have reported seeing disturbingly inappropriate usernames — none of which we're going to share here — that reference all manner of uncomfortable topics.

Though primarily a business leadership book, there are interesting insights into his life, career and his years with Nintendo.\nAnother angle picked up, this time by VGC, relates to the launch of the Game Boy Micro. This came relatively early in Fils-Aimé's time at the company, when he was executive vice president of sales and marketing. As a device it was desired by enthusiast fans because of its looks, but the market reality was that its tiny size didn't make it a practical way to comfortably play games, and the Game Boy Advance was already being replaced by the DS.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

That's a fantastic deal for a comfy mouse with 11 programmable buttons, adjustable weights and an 'infinite' scroll wheel. \nIf you prefer your mice with more batteries and fewer cables, the wireless G502 Lightspeed is also discounted heavily, from £129.99 to £57.99. I reckon that's strong value for a mouse that remains comfy, high-spec and fully-featured, while adding on Logitech's industry-leading wireless tech. The wireless mouse is also much less frequently discounted than its predecessor, which does tend to see a price drop in line with the major 'shopping holidays' of the year. \nRead more",

Systems should not govern people's behaviour, he says, the people are what matters.\nThrowing off the shackles of a faceless process governing your life is a recurring theme in this blend of sci-fi RPG and interactive fiction, and it makes for a strong rags-to-ramen story of one robot on the run.

There's a slightly chonkier preview build knocking about now, and I'll say this for it: you need to put the time in.\nThere's more to say as well, but that was my main takeaway from the current build. Much like actual gardening, a lot of The Garden Path is inscrutable to me - at least from the visits I've made to the garden so far, which is actually more of a free-form forest at present. Presumably after some effort on my part I can shape it how I'd like. But if current trends hold that will take a long time. Cos plants.\nRead more",

Over the last ten years they've tackled every genre, from tower defence to turn-based tactics, RPGs and action platformers. With their latest game, The Gunk, they've finally entered the realm of 3D adventure games. Released on Xbox Game Pass at the tail end of last year, The Gunk was a big step up for the makers of SteamWorld Dig. Not only was it their first game in 3D, and their first time using a new engine, but it was also their first title that had nothing to do with the series they'd built their name on. As it makes its way to Steam today, I sat down with director Ulf Hartelius to talk more about the creation of the game's titular goop, and how the timing of its environmental themes about cleaning up its gunked up planet was much more than just a Death Stranding-style happy accident. \nRead more",

It's an Ventus 3X OC model from MSI, with a hefty triple-slot thermal solution that ought to keep the card cool and quiet even running at its factory overclocked 1695MHz. \nTo get the discounted price, use code SAVE75 to knock a healthy £75 off the list price. That brings it down to £1054, just £5 more than the UK RRP and a great deal for an OC model. You also get free delivery, with the card slated to arrive just after the upcoming bank holiday. \nRead more",

Young, the hero of their Link’s Awakening-influenced debut Anodyne, may not technically be one, but he bears the coke-bottle glasses and white coat that may make you think he is. Aliph, the put-upon protagonist of the haunting, grief-stricken 2D side-scroller Even The Ocean, works as power plant technician. Nova, hero of Analgesic’s tour de force Anodyne 2: Return To Dust, labours as a Nano Cleaner, one with the ability to shrink inside the psyches of those plagued by Nano Dust, corrupting their thoughts. Even the word analgesic itself has a scientific background; the term means a pain-relieving drug.\r\n\n\r\nWhen the player begins Analgesic’s newest game Sephonie - part 3D platformer, part deep emotional story - three Taiwanese biologists make their way onto the titular island to explore. As the Steam page puts it: “Amy Lim, Taiwanese-American and bold leader, hails from the midwestern USA town of Bloomington. Riyou Hayashi, an analytically-minded Japanese-Taiwanese researcher, calls the bustling Tokyo his home. And Ing-wen Lin, a kind and considerate Taiwanese scientist, lives in Taipei.”\r\n\n \nRead more",

Upgrades up the wazoo, gold bursting from your breeches, double-jumps and air-dashes.

          "description": "Corsair make a particularly fine selection of AiOs, also known as all-in-one liquid coolers. They use off-the-shelf designs for their pumps and radiators, as do many other companies, but distinguish themselves with good-quality fans, optional lighting and low prices for a major brand. That last point is particularly pertinent today, as their H100X 240mm AiO has dropped to nearly £60 on Amazon UK - a significantly lower price than any alternative that I'd rate as highly and some £25 below this AiO's original launch price. \nRead more",

First released in 2011 as a Half-Life 2 mod, it is a wild fantasy about what it might be like to not be in front of the computer for a while. There’s also some bonus themes in here about determinism in narrative fiction and the illusion of choice, framed as a satire of contemporary game design, but also as an incisive commentary on the notion of free will in general.\r\n\n\r\nBut most of all, I think that The Stanley Parable is a game about not being in front of the computer for a little while, as a treat. There’s an achievement you get for not playing the game for five years, and in The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe – a remastered version for consoles that adds some new content – there’s another achievement for ten. If they could implement an achievement for feeding all of your worldly belongings into a woodchipper and staggering naked into the forest to live with the animals, they probably would.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It looks like it's probably not worth anyone's time except schoolkids playing on computers in the IT department during their lunch breaks. But goodness me, is there more going on here than meets the eye.\nAs I've made abundantly clear ever since I joined RPS, battle royales are my jam. I'll happily bulk out my Steam library with reams of half-baked ideas and clunky combat systems in the hopes of finding the next big time-sink for me and my squadmates to get lost in over the next several months. I fully expected Rocket Bot Royale to be left at the bottom of my most played games on Steam list after a few weeks, but after a few hours of play, I'm starting to think eventually it might arrive at the top. It's Worms, but with tanks. It's free to play. And I absolutely cannot stop playing it.\nRead more",

All the familiar civilizations are back, except for the mantis-like Thalan, and there are some newbies like the Festron Hunt: crab monsters that eat other races and sound a bit like Neal Asher's Prador. Maps are now broken into discrete chunks called Star Sectors too, linked by subspace streams that have to be discovered and researched so they can be navigated. \r\n\n \nRead more",

You must cross the finish line as fast as you possibly can, but the chequered flag only springs up if you've turned every demon along the way into a red paste.\nThe game is an FPS for perfectionists and speed junkies who want to look cool. It's quite literally a time attack with a learning curve that's worth investing in. Sure, the littlest mistakes can mean disaster, but when you take time to master a course, it's a payoff you'll remember.\nRead more",

If you want the cheapest model that's in stock right now, then that'll be the Inno3D RTX 3070 Ti X3 at Overclockers for £10 more.

The Ghosts can possess objects in the world to hide inside, and their job is to survive until midnight. The Hunters must use a variety of high-tech gadgets and weapons to track down and destroy the Ghosts before that time, or else risk being hunted themselves once midnight strikes.\nThe game is already out on Steam Early Access, and has been for a few weeks now. You’ll probably know already whether you’d be interested in giving it a go: after all, it’s Prop Hunt. But it’s also got a fair few more bells and whistles than other Prop Hunt-likes that I’ve come across. So, a group of us decided to get together one chill winter’s eve (sunny Friday morning actually, but hey, I’m tryna set a spooky tone), and bash each other’s heads with inanimate objects for a few hours. And judging from all the yelps and shouting, I’d say we had a good time.\nRead more",

          "description": "Part of the modern soundscape is a sing-song synthetic voice telling us about everything from slime recipes and teenage drama to unionisation procedures and scissor-wielding 'fashion hacks' that surely are covert fetish videos. It is TikTok's text-to-speech voice, and it is everywhere. Now it's even in Half-Life, thanks to a mod which replaces the opening tram ride voiceover with a TikTok TTS version. It's a distressing artifact, and I hate that it kinda works. See/hear for yourself in the video below.\nRead more",

          "description": "Of all the booths at PAX East 2022 this year, Larian's Baldur's Gate III stand was by far one of the most impressive. Not only did they construct an entire walled city to hark back to its iconic, titular location, but they also had an enormous Nautiloid crashed into the top of it. There was a Mindflayer statue on hand as well, for fans to pose with next to their official cosplayers, and a little campfire for attendees to have a small sit down on, just like they'd do when resting in the game. It was such an incredible booth that we asked Larian to give us a tour of it, and while we did so we also took the opportunity to chat a bit about the reception of Update 7, the confirmation of its 2023 release date and more. \nRead more",

Co nás tedy čeká?\r\n\r\nKupříkladu jak vdechnout 30 let starým digitálkám nový život náhradní elektronikou, logický analyzátor z RP2040, kde sehnat učebnice programování STM32 v češtině, nové pluginy pro KiCAD nebo jak odemknout naprogramované ATtiny, pokud jde o vážná témata.\r\n\r\nZ kategorie úsměvných může působit například ezonávod na opravu LED žárovky na webu zabývajícím se (možná poněkud \"alternativním\") zdravím, trollení majitelů Tesel otevíráním \"palivových\" víček na dálku nebo sluchátkové zesilovače s elektronkovým koncovým stupněm, kterému předchází osmijádrový procesor XMOS.\r\n\r\nPříští Virtuální Bastlírna se pod taktovkou projektu MacGyver studentského klubu SiliconHill bude konat v pondělí 2. května od 20:00 minimálně do 22:00 (ale obvykle končíme o dost později).

A new trailer provides another look at the trials Obi-Wan will face, including confronting his former apprentice. \nKenobi is on the run, looking to find, protect, and train Luke Skywalker, son of his former apprentice Anakin Skywalker. He must also find refuge away from the Inquisitors, an Imperial group of elite soldiers looking to find him and kill the remaining Jedi. It looks like it’s going to be a great time, both as a new story in the Star Wars universe and as a return to beloved characters like Ewan McGregor’s Kenobi and Hayden Christensen’s Anakin Skywalker turned Darth Vader. \n\nWe get a glimpse at both Vader and the Inquisitors, as well as new looks at Kenobi, Luke Skywalker, his uncle, and more in a new trailer released by Disney today to celebrate Star Wars Day. You can check it out below: \n\n\nAs you can in the trailer, the Inquisitors are on the hunt and they won’t stop until they can bring Kenobi to their master, Darth Vader. And speaking of Vader, we get a quick glimpse of him putting on the pieces of his iconic suit right at the end. Here’s hoping he’s suiting up for Kenobi vs. Skywalker Round 2 because that’s something we really want to see. \nTo accompany the trailer, Disney has also released a new poster for Obi-Wan Kenobi that features both the titular character and Darth Vader and it's very dope. \n#ObiWanKenobi, a limited series, starts streaming May 27 on @DisneyPlus. pic.twitter.com/E8RVqZXiuq\nMay 4, 2022\nAre you excited about Obi-Wan Kenobi?

In total, these two character packs bring 10 new playable Lego-fied characters to The Skywalker Saga.\n\n\nFor the uninitiated, The Bad Batch is a spin-off of The Clone Wars and The Mandalorian is a sci-fi western that centers on a very Boba Fett-like Mandalorian whose job is to protect a young member of Yoda's race (AKA \"Baby Yoda\"). If you haven’t yet watched Season 2 of The Mandalorian, you should try to avoid today’s DLC because the characters from the new Mandalorian pack are based on Season 2 of the Disney Plus series. \n“Warner Bros. Games celebrates Star Wars Day with the launch of two new DLC packs for Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga – The Mandalorian Season 2 and Star Wars: The Bad Batch,” a press release reads. “The Mandalorian Season 2 pack will include Ahsoka Tano, Boba Fett, Bo Katan, Fennec Shand, and Moff Gideon. Star Wars: The Bad Batch character pack will linclude Hunter, Wrecker, Tech, Crosshair, and Echo.”\nIf you own the Character Collection Pack for the game, you’ll receive both of today’s packs as well as the packs based on Season 1 of The Mandalorian, Solo: A Star Wars Story, Classic Characters, the Trooper Pack, and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. You can also purchase each pack individually. \n\nTT Games says Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, which was released just last month, holds the record for the biggest Lego game launch ever.

One of the main draws of the new season comes from the two new play spaces fans will slay each other upon. First up is Catalyst, a smaller arena map that is visually reminiscent of past combat zones such as Guardian from Halo 3. Big Team Battle fans aren't to be forgotten, as they too will be getting a map to wreak havoc on in Breaker. This Banished ship-breaking yard is a sprawling molten space where players will have to carefully avoid some of the lava pitfalls on their way to securing the Gravity Hammer.\nNew maps aren't the only addition in Season 2, though. Fans will finally get new modes to try out in the form of Land Grab, Last Spartan Standing, and the classic King of the Hill. On top of that, there are more narrative and special events, a sparkling new battle pass, and a more fully fleshed-out version of the multiplayer 343 hoped to release last year. But will it be enough to keep Halo fans happy? You'll just have to join us on today's stream to find out!\nIf you are enjoying our Twitch streams, be sure to subscribe to the channel to know the second we go live and to gain access to our Discord channel. On top of special shows like today, we also stream every Thursday and Friday to check out the latest new game and celebrate the past with Replay, respectively.",

          "description": "Sonic Prime is an upcoming animated Netflix series that was first announced in February 2021. We haven’t heard much of a peep about it since, and though we’re still waiting for a proper trailer, a new promotional video provides the first glimpse of the show. \nNetflix released a trailer montage promoting its upcoming slate of kid-friendly animated shows. Sonic Prime pops up at the very end, with Sonic sprinting and collecting rings across Green Hill Zone. Sonic also speaks, giving fans the first sample of voice actor Deven Mack’s performance. You can catch the clip at the 1:49 mark. \n\n\nUnfortunately, Sonic Prime still doesn't have a premiere date. We only know that the show consists of 24 episodes and centers on Sonic fighting to save a multiverse from supposed doom. Netlfix's official description of the series pegs it as a \"journey of self-discovery and redemption.\" Other cast members include Ashleigh Ball, Shannon Chan-Kent, Brian Drummond, Vincent Tong, Ian Hanlin, Kazumi Evans, and Adam Narada. \nIt’s a great time to be Sonic the Hedgehog. His second theatrical film had the best opening weekend of any video game movie in history, a third film has already been greenlit, and another animated show spun-off from those movies is coming to Paramount+. He’s also got two games slated for 2022. Sonic Origins, a remastered bundle of classic Sonic games, arrives in June, while Sonic Frontiers, the hedgehog’s first open-world adventure, releases later this year.",

          "description": "The development of Shenmue III seemed like a long shot. Eighteen years passed between the latest entry and Shenmue II. For almost two decades, fans were unsure if their favorite brawler would ever return. Then the seemingly impossible happened: Yu Suzuki's Shenmue III Kickstarter campaign amassed more than $7 million and over 69,000 backers. The third chapter in Ryo Hazuki's revenge quest was released in 2019 to mixed critical reception and performed \"fine\" financially. Suzuki recently voiced enthusiasm for Shenmue IV but primarily wants the game to be more accessible for newcomers.\nAccording to VGC, Suzuki spoke about Shenmue IV at a special event in Yokosuka, the city where the story takes place. Suzuki said that Shenmue IV was created with longtime fans in mind, which might've inadvertently alienated newer players. Despite being satisfied with overall reactions to the game, Suzuki felt that it wasn't a good entry point. Currently, there are \"no concrete plans\" for Shenmue IV, but Suzuki wants to make sure that it can appeal to a broader audience.\n\"With Shenmue 3, I really responded to the fans’ voices, so I wasn’t necessarily thinking about making any money,” Suzuki announced at the event. “But since I’m running a company, I have to think about what can sell if I continue. I’ve been seriously talking about it over and over again.” \nPublisher Deep Silver's parent company, Embracer Group, released a statement about Shenmue III's financial success in 2020 during an earnings presentation. CEO Lars Wingefors stated that the third game was a \"core niche product.\" \nThere are no confirmed development plans for Shenmue IV. Even so, Suzuki has stated an interest in continuing the series. In other news, Square Enix sold Crystal Dynamics, Eidos-Montréal, And More, Including Tomb Raider IP, To Embracer Group. \nWould you like to play the next Shenmue game?

It’s not surprising that Sony is looking to hire somebody like this, especially when you look at the current video game landscape – it feels like every other week, a major acquisition is announced. \n“Sony Interactive Entertainment seeks a highly qualified Director, Corporate Development,” Sony’s job listing reads. “SIE’s Corporate Development Team works closely with SIE’s management team and is responsible for identifying inorganic growth opportunities through acquisitions, investments, or joint ventures. The team sources, evaluates, and completes transactions that are aligned with SIE’s strategic priorities and drive significant long-term value for the company.”\nElsewhere in the listing, it says Sony is looking for someone to drive proactive deal sourcing, including developing relationships with external and internal partners. \nNews that Sony is looking for what is essentially an acquisitions director is not surprising – acquisitions have largely defined gaming in 2022 thus far. It started with Take-Two Interactive, the parent company behind the Grand Theft Auto series, announcing back in January that it was acquiring mobile giant Zynga for nearly $13 billion. Then, the following week, Microsoft announced it was acquiring Activision Blizzard, the company behind Overwatch and Call of Duty, for a colossal $68.7 billion. Two weeks after that, Sony revealed it was buying Bungie for $3.6 billion and later announced it had acquired Jade Raymond’s new studio, Haven Studios. \n[Source: Video Games Chronicle]",

Going even further, they’ve played Elden Ring using it. Controller modder Rudeism (on Twitter) posted a clip yesterday of him using this modded controller to play Elden Ring and while that alone is impressive, what makes it better is that the Fisher-Price controller still lights up and makes all the sounds it usually does. \nhere's the Fisher Price Xbox controller in action!\n@Wario64 for the off-hand joke that inspired me to make this happen 😂 pic.twitter.com/3OETvcsEsI\nMay 1, 2022\nAs you can see in the video above, it’s quite a hilarious mod. As for how fun actually playing Elden Ring with this controller is, well, only Rudeism knows but something tells us it’s going to be a little harder to take down Radahn this way. Imagine dying to Radahn, while he has just a sliver of health left, only to hear a Fisher-Price song begin playing, almost as if to taunt you in your death. \nFor more, read Game Informer’s Elden Ring review and then read about the latest Elden Ring patch, which fixes an infamous Malenia bug.

This week, we continue our season by analyzing the second game in Supergiant's catalog, Transistor.\nReleased for PlayStation 4 on May 18, 2014, and PC a day later, Transistor was a very different game for Supergiant to make compared to its freshman effort a few years prior. Development started just a few months following the release of Bastion, and while its first game was a success, the tight-knit studio wanted to prove what it did wasn't lightning in a bottle. In this episode, we discuss the various ways Supergiant pushed against the ever-present shadow of Bastion in the games design and the studio's production methods. We also cover the process of creating a new retro-inspired cyberpunk setting, the unique tactical action combat, and how the studio landed on a voiceless lounge singer named Red and her talking sword, the Transistor, as the main characters.\nJoin hosts Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), John Carson (@John_Carson), and Game Informer Magazine Content Director Matt Miller (@MatthewRMiller) for a verbal stroll through the history and narrative of Transistor! \nIf you'd like to get in touch with the Video Gameography podcast, you can email us at podcast@gameinformer.com.

          "description": "A not-so-long time ago in the same galaxy we all reside in, Respawn Entertainment deviated from its first-person shooter roots to create Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This third-person action game was the studio’s first stab at tackling the coveted Star Wars license, crafting an original adventure set five years after Revenge of the Sith. It stars Cal Kestis, a padawan turned junker (played by Shameless star Cameron Monaghan) that managed to evade the Jedi purge of Order 66. After he’s outed by the Sith, he embarks on a quest to recover an artifact capable of locating force-sensitive children while also avoiding capture by the Inquisitors, who are elite Jedi hunters. \nThe game features a blend of lightsaber combat and a suite of Force abilities. Borrowing inspiration from FromSoftware’s Soul series, encounters are challenging, requiring a strategic blend of blocks and parries to outduel opponents. Meanwhile, the various planets take on a Metroid-inspired progression with players unlocking abilities to backtrack to previously inaccessible areas. \nWatch on Twitch!\nFallen Order was released on November 15, 2019, and was a critical and financial success. It also served as a saving grace for single-player fans, providing proof to an increasingly multiplayer-focused EA that linear story-driven experiences can still make the big bucks. With a sequel reportedly in the works, we’re revisiting this gem of the Star Wars video game pantheon. \nJoin Marcus Stewart, Jill Grodt, and Wesley LeBlanc on Twitch today at a special start time of 12:30 p.m. Central as we journey through the entirety of Cal Kestis’ adventure. Expect plenty of laughs, deaths, and general nerding out over all things Star Wars. We encourage you to hang out with us in chat.

On top of that, thanks to its anthology-like nature, if one Final Fantasy game doesn’t click for you, there’s a good chance another one will.

What’s more, it’s available for pre-order now for $299.99, and if it’s something you just have to have, you should act fast because there are only 1000 of them in total. Pre-orders are expected to ship sometime between November of this year and January 2023. So if you buy one, you don’t have to wait too long to have it in your hands. \n\n“Reaper Sovereign has landed on Eden Prime after 50,000 years and is reigning down planet-shattering destruction,” Dark Horse’s description reads. “This spectacular replica is made of polyresin and crafted by the masters at Gentle Giant Studios. At 14 inches tall on an 11-inch diameter base, this statue will have you re-experiencing this iconic moment from Mass Effect.” \nGentle Giant Studios is responsible for the sculpting, prototyping, and paint of the replica, which is made out of polyresin, and you can only order a maximum of two. While waiting for yours to arrive, read our breakdown of the reveal trailer for the next Mass Effect game, which was announced in 2020. After that, read about how the next Mass Effect could revert back to using Unreal Engine instead of EA’s Frostbite, and then check out the latest teaser for the next Mass Effect. \nAre you going to pick up one of these replica Reaper ships?

It sounds very Modern Warfare-y and looks very Modern Warfare-y, too, but it doesn’t reveal much about the actual game. Perhaps there’s something to be made out of the muddled voices playing during the trailer, but it’s likely that this teaser is just setting the stage for a bigger reveal in the coming weeks or months. The Call of Duty account that tweeted out the teaser does say, “The new era of Call of Duty is coming,” so perhaps the company believes this game will shake up the franchise in a big way. \nIt wouldn’t be surprising because Infinity Ward's 2019 Modern Warfare reboot did just that for the series, especially in its rollout a few months before Call of Duty: Warzone. Plus, 2019’s Modern Warfare is still regarded by many as the best Call of Duty in recent years. With Infinity Ward working on Modern Warfare II, fans are likely excited to see what this sequel looks like. Sadly, there’s no telling when the next look will be but if it’s like Call of Duty reveals in years past, we could be weeks or even days away. Only time will tell.\nIn the meantime, read about how a sequel to Warzone is expected to drop this year and then check out this story about how Call of Duty will reportedly skip 2023.

          "description": "11 Bit Studios’ celebrated anti-war game, This War of Mine, is getting revamped and expanded for a re-release on modern consoles.\nDubbed the Final Cut, the game, in which players manage a party of civilians surviving in a war-torn city, is coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S –including Xbox Game Pass – on May 10. It boasts a 4K resolution and a readjusted UI. Content-wise, it includes the locations from the base game and introduces a new character, quests, and events. \nAdditionally, the three DLC narrative episodes, This War of Mine: Stories, will be available for purchase separately on PS5/XSX. This War of Mine: Complete Edition is a bundle containing Final Cut and Stories if you want everything.  \n11 Bit Studios, based in Poland, states that the ongoing Ukraine/Russia conflict is the motivator to re-release This War of Mine and repromote its anti-war messaging to a new group of players. The studio recently raised nearly $700,000 for Ukrainian civilian aid by heavily discounting the previous versions of This War of Mine. 11 Bit CEO Przemek Marszal says in a press release: \n\"The message and themes existing inside of This War of Mine have, unfortunately, become brutally vivid and relevant in recent months. We believe it’s especially important to educate people on the realities of war right now, while its horrifying reality has become a daily struggle for people that are close to us. We’re proud that recent This War of Mine fundraising helped us create a wave of spontaneous help for war victims in Ukraine, and we hope we can further spread our antiwar message with This War of Mine: Final Cut.”\nFor more on This War of Mine, check out our review of the original 2014 release here. You can also catch up on how the game industry has helped assist those affected by the war in Ukraine here.",
