As a brand, though, it's maintained a strong presence online even in quieter times, with the enthusiast fanbase in particular celebrating the IP in many ways with fanart, music and videos.\nIn recent days and weeks, though, a number of Sonic-focused creators have highlighted that their content is getting flagged as 'Made For Kids' on YouTube, even though they've not marked their content as such when it was uploaded. This seems to be driven by an algorithm, with appeals rejected almost instantly by YouTube, and the impact is reduced visibility and monetisation for the videos.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Pokémon HOME will be getting an update that will allow the most recent Pokémon games — Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl and Pokémon Legends: Arceus — to be compatible with the Cloud service storage app.\nWith Legends: Arceus being set in the past, Pokémon HOME introduces a new type of Poké Ball for the game — the Strange Ball. When Pokémon are transferred to the game from the Diamond and Pearl remakes or Pokémon Sword and Shield, they will appear in a Strange Ball, because normal Poké Balls don't exist in this time period yet!

Who doesn’t love the idea of sailing the seas, plundering and pillaging along the way with a trusty crew at their side? There is just one thing that can make the pirate’s life even more appealing, and that is, of course, copious fan service. That’s the idea behind Seven Pirates H, which combines turn-based combat with physics-defying busts on Nintendo Switch.\nSeven Pirates H isn’t exactly a new game; it was originally released as Genkai Tokki: Seven Pirates for the PlayStation Vita back in 2016, but only saw release in Japan at the time. Now, thanks to the good folks at Eastasiasoft, the Western world gets to enjoy this surprisingly fun and deep RPG on the Switch.

It's clear that working on To the Moon and Finding Paradise, two games that were also made using the RPG Maker XP engine, has influenced Shigihara's own emotional game.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

But rather than be overwhelmed by its power, I personally feel more like the RTX 3090 Ti is trying to trick, tempt and seduce me, Old Testament-style. “Recommend meeeee” it whispers, coasting through another maximum settings benchmark. “Tell evvvvvvveryone these frame rates are totally worth £1879.”\r\n\n\r\nBut I can’t. Sorry. While I am a sucker for go-faster gear, the RTX 3090 Ti is just too far of a stretch, with its sometimes imperceptible performance differences to the £1399 RTX 3090 and a tendency towards impractically gigantic partner card models.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Straka note they are a small team who playtested with a very small group, and didn't realise the game would be unwelcoming to newcomers. In fact, they've already made some smaller tweaks to the game that have made quite a difference, but the most notable problem players raised was the lack of any, umm, loot? \nRead more",

Despite suffering a stroke just a couple of months beforehand, the 85-year-old YouTuber was on fine form during her PAX East panel, speaking to a packed out theatre of fans and viewers who have spent the better part of six years following her various playthroughs through Skyrim as a multitude of different characters. She talked briefly about her writing and character creation process for her Let's Play-style videos, before spending a whopping 45 minutes answering questions from the audience. These covered everything from her favourite things in Skyrim to her favourite, real-life candy, and also included a surprising number of horror game recommendations. In her own words, she loves stuff that's \"weird and creepy\", and has recently been looking for something new to play. \"I’d really like to play a dark, scary game,\" she said, and the audience were only too happy to oblige. \nIt was a truly wonderful way to spend a Saturday afternoon, and as soon as it was over, both Liam and I knew it was too good not to share. Here's a written transcript of the entire audience Q&A in full, plus a summary of her opening speech, for your reading pleasure. \nRead more",

Now known as Remnants Of The Rift, I've been putting this toe-tapping roguelike through its paces. \nRead more",

          "description": "Salt And Sacrifice is a 2D metroidvania hunt-a-thon that casts you as a condemned prisoner in an imperiled kingdom. Magic is corrupting the land, giving rise to monstrous creatures and ravenous undead, and the source of all of this destruction, Mages, must be hunted and their hearts devoured if the Kingdom is to survive. Like Ska Studios’s previous outing, the game features difficult combat, extensive equipment options, and hulking bosses to slay. But while the scale has increased and the combat and visuals are as slick as ever, there are some growing pains that only just manage to hold the game back from its full potential.\nUpon booting the game up, it’s immediately clear that you’re in for a visual treat.The design and detail are just ever so lovely: from the way firelight gives a soft glow to its surroundings in the twilight, to how fog wafts lazily over cobble stairways in a musty dungeon, it’s all just so utterly gorgeous to look at. Ska Studios have always had a recognizable art style – imposing architecture and grungy moppets – but it’s plain to see here that they’ve upped their game in the best possible way. According to the devs, every asset was created from scratch, and that care shows in every frame.\nRead more",

          "description": "I spent much of my childhood hunkered around the family PC using an emulator to run Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Arcade Game. Years have passed since I last played, causing the vague memories to distort into a recollection that’s nothing like reality. In my head, that first arcade game captured the frenetic energy of the TMNT cartoons I’d watch on a Saturday morning. The reality was quite different, with the turtles awkwardly bumbling through Manhattan while occasionally smacking an enemy.\nThat realisation has never been more apparent than after playing the first two levels of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge, a successor to those early beat ‘em up TMNT arcade games being developed by Tribute Games and published by DotEmu. It captures the aesthetic of those childhood memories and makes them a reality, which is a testament to Tribute Games’ understanding of TMNT as a brand. But it also feels far too familiar, failing to substantially innovate on the original formula.\nRead more",

Or you can just figure out which one is your favourite, and keep it on forever more. \nThe Naga Trinity's UK RRP is £110, but it normally goes for about £70 or £80.

To say I'm overprotective is an understatement. \nThankfully, the Grey Knights in Warhammer 40K: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters are made of sterner stuff. I mean, just look at these brutes. They're enormous. Even the Gears Of War lads would be jealous of the kind of muscle these big robo boys are packing, I'm telling you now. They're by no means invincible, of course, but they can hold their own out of cover, and pick themselves back up again when your best laid plans inevitably start going down the drain.

That's a fantastic deal for a comfy mouse with 11 programmable buttons, adjustable weights and an 'infinite' scroll wheel. \nIf you prefer your mice with more batteries and fewer cables, the wireless G502 Lightspeed is also discounted heavily, from £129.99 to £57.99. I reckon that's strong value for a mouse that remains comfy, high-spec and fully-featured, while adding on Logitech's industry-leading wireless tech.

          "description": "Codemasters Cheshire has been absorbed by Criterion Games to develop new Need For Speed games. \nEA announced in March of 2021 that it was delaying its next Need For Speed game out of 2021 and into 2022 so that Criterion could instead focus on development of Battlefield 2042 alongside DICE. Then, earlier this week, EA confirmed in its financial results that it was expecting to release a new Need For Speed this year while also revealing that it has four unknown games set to release between January 2023 and March 2023. Now, we have an update regarding the future of the franchise. \nWe can confirm Criterion Games and the development team at Codemasters Cheshire are officially coming together to create the future of @NeedforSpeed, forming one Criterion studio with two location hubs. [1/3]\nMay 12, 2022\nNow, as you can see in the tweets above, Codemasters goes just short of saying it and Criterion are working on the Need For Speed expected to release this year. It wouldn’t be surprising if this new studio team-up were doing just that, but as it stands in these tweets, it seems the merged studio is looking ahead to the future of the Need For Speed franchise. \nPersonally, I hope that future includes a return to the Underground series or maybe even just a remaster of the first Underground – whatever it takes to listen to Lil Jon’s \"Get Low\" again while driving around a neon-lit, nighttime city, to be honest. \nWhat do you hope to see in the future for Need For Speed?

This time, the iconic Chucks highlight a single Pokémon on each pair. There are Pikachu shoes, Eevee shoes, Charizard shoes, and Mewtwo shoes, and all four pairs look amazing. \n\nAs you can see in the images above, the shoes are designed to match the main color of each Pokémon they represent – the Pikachu shoes are bright yellow, the Eevee shoes a tan-ish brown, the Charizard pair are fire-type orange, and the Mewtwo chucks are a stylish and subdued pink-ish purple. Unfortunately, all signs point to this drop being exclusive to Japan. \nFirst off, they only seem to be available on Converse’s Japan website, with all four pairs expected to go live this week for roughly $75. There’s also the fact that the shoes feature the Japanese nomenclature of each Pokémon’s name, which is why the Charizard shoes say Lizardon. However, that might just be a styling decision so perhaps there’s a chance that these shoes make their way over to the West sometime in the future. For now, though, it seems you’ll need to navigate the Converse Japan site to secure a pair (or four pairs) of your own. \nIn the meantime, check out the most recent Pokémon x Converse team-up and then read about the reveal of Pokémon Violet and Pokémon Scarlet after that. \n[Source: Kotaku]\nWhich pair of Chucks are your favorite amongst this lineup?

Next month, we can run off to our favorite Lego supplier to grab an Optimus Prime Lego set. We don't know what it looks like yet, how many pieces are in the box, or how much it will cost, but it's OPTIMUS PRIME! None of that stuff matters. This will likely be a no-brainer purchase for Transformers fans. Here's Lego's official teaser announcement:\nBegin the epic build. #LEGO #Transformers #OptimusPrime pic.twitter.com/rjdQbdej43\nMay 11, 2022\nLego is kicking of Transformers' reign in Lego the right way: with the leader of the Autobots. If this product flies off of shelves (which it likely will), I'd love to see more Transformers get the brick treatment. Megatron would likely be the second set, and what comes next is anyone's guess. Grimlock, Bumblebee, Soundwave, and Starscream are a handful of characters that probably wouldn't be far off.\nI'm guessing the brilliant minds at Lego have figured out how to use all of the pieces in the box for two transformations: the robot form and the vehicle. Some Lego sets that already exist use the same pieces for three different builds (meaning we could get some triple changers!)\nWhat do you think of Transformers moving on from Kre-O brick building to Lego? Which characters or action sets would you like to see next?\nI'm an avid Lego collector and builder. The only thing that may scare me off of this set is if it is based on the Transformers films. I'm hoping Lego goes with a Generation 1 design, which debuted in the 1980s era cartoon.",

She’s playing a game called Wordscapes, which is an excellent tool for helping kids practice spelling and discover new words. My daughter and I worked out a deal that if she plays 20 minutes of Wordscapes, she can then scamper upstairs to play Roblox with her friends for the next two hours. She balked at the idea at first but has taken to enjoying Wordscapes. She periodically asks me for help and cashes in her in-game coins for answers when she has them, but the game is helping her learn, and I’m grateful for it.\nWordscapes is for kids eight years of age and older.

However, that’s where the known quantities end, save for the next EA Sports PGA Tour which was delayed to early 2023, because Quarter 4, which encompasses the January 2023 to March 2023 time period, contains four unknowns: Major IP, Partner Title, Remake, and Sports Title. \nEA notes on the slide that these four titles scheduled for Q4 of the 2023 Fiscal Year “have not yet been publicly disclosed,” which is why the names of those games aren’t listed on the slide.

I walked away from this footage with mixed feelings yet still plenty of excitement for the game's October 25 release.\nFirst, let's start with a positive: It has plenty of the Arkham formula in its coding. The flow of combat, the density of the open world, and the overall dark vibe align nicely with the Arkham series, which this Montreal studio had a hand in with Arkham Origins.

The announcement comes from a blog post from Electronic Arts that reveals what's next for the footie franchise.\nWith the current deal dissolving in 2023, EA will no longer use the FIFA name on its popular football series but will instead adopt the moniker of EA Sports FC. It's shedding any licensed identity in the name but still keeping many of its deals with existing football clubs and players. Cam Weber, General Manager of EA Sports, writes in the blog post, \"Everything you love about our games will be part of EA Sports FC – the same great experiences, modes, leagues, tournaments, clubs, and athletes will be there.\" \nOutside of potentially losing the use of the World Cup tournament, it's unclear what else might be missing in future iterations. However, EA is still boasting impressive numbers of players and teams involved moving forward.\nOur unique licensing portfolio of more than 19,000+ players, 700+ teams, 100+ stadiums, and 30 leagues that we’ve continued to invest in for decades will still be there, uniquely in EA Sports FC,\" says Weber. \"That includes exclusive partnerships with the Premier League, LaLiga, Bundesliga, Serie A, the MLS – and more to come.\"\nThis year's FIFA 23 sounds like it will be business as usual with more features, World Cup content, leagues, clubs, and more and won't be subject to any of these changes. Weber says that we'll have to wait until summer 2023 to hear more of what's to come for EA Sports FC.\nHow do you feel about this change in branding and partnership? Is FIFA just a name to you, or does it bring something special to EA's brand of virtual soccer? Let us know in the comments below!",

Depending on players' choices, the fate of legendary protagonist Commander Shepard was either ambiguously hopeful or dismally tragic. Mass Effect Andromeda moved away from a Shepard-led story, and players have been eagerly awaiting any news about the next numbered installment. A Mass Effect 4 trailer dropped during the 2020 Game Awards and revealed everyone's favorite Asari Shadow Broker. And now, a new lithograph might be hinting at the return of the illustrious Commander. \nAccording to a VGC report, the initial description of a Mass Effect lithograph says it all: \"While Shepard and the survivors are left to pick up the pieces, fans are left wondering what’s next.\" YouTuber MrHulthen noted that the text was quickly swapped out for something less direct. It now reads, \"The threat of the Reapers might have been ended, but at great cost including Earth itself. While the survivors are left to pick up the pieces, fans are left wondering what’s next.\" Read the whole thing for yourself by clicking the link above. Could this sudden change mean that the Commander is coming back? Only time will tell, as Mass Effect 4 narrative details have been particularly scarce. \n\n\nOf course, BioWare isn't only working on its famed space opera. The next adventure in its high fantasy RPG franchise, Dragon Age, is on the way too. Similarly, story info for that game is few and far between, but excitement for both series couldn't possibly be higher. \n[Source: VGC]\nWould you like to star as Commander Shepard again?

However, if it’s like the most recent Indie World Showcase that aired in December, we could be in for some indie treats. \nTune in May 11 at 7:00 a.m. PT for a new @IndieWorldNA Showcase featuring roughly 20 minutes of information on upcoming indie games headed to Nintendo Switch. #IndieWorld\nhttps://t.co/OCOJhqYfD9 pic.twitter.com/5nuNImMLB0\nMay 10, 2022\nThat December showcase came with the release of Chicory: A Colorful Tale on Switch, a new look at Sea of Stars, and several game reveals, and it was a great time. Hopefully, tomorrow’s 20-minute presentation lives up to that.  As you might have guessed, fans are already preparing their ritual circles in hopes that Hollow Knight’s sequel, Hollow Knight Silksong, makes an appearance, just as they did ahead of the last Indie World Showcase. Naturally, there’s no word on if Silksong will make an appearance tomorrow, but it’d be a great moment if it did appear. \nWhile waiting for tomorrow’s showcase, catch up on everything announced in the December Indie World Showcase, and then read Game Informer’s list of our most anticipated indie releases for 2022. If you’re looking for an indie to play today, be sure to check out Game Informer’s list of the top 10 indies to play right now. \nAre you excited about tomorrow’s Indie World Showcase?

The folks at Warner Bros. Montreal feel the same way and have released a 13+ minute gameplay walkthrough featuring two members of the bat family, Nightwing and Red Hood. Not only do we get to see plenty of new gameplay, but the studio has also announced Gotham Knights is officially available to preorder as of today.\nGotham Knights' game director Geoff Ellenor introduces the walkthrough you can watch in the video above.

However, Nintendo invests heavily in the franchise, and Pokémon games have always been released exclusively on Nintendo consoles. So, it’s hard not to call it a first-party franchise.

Its tumultuous cycle, which began in 1997, spawned several builds and demos by original developer 3D Realms. Today, footage of one of those early versions of the game has appeared online.\nAs spotted by GameSpot, a 4Chan user known as x0r uploaded footage of a 1-minute, 20-second slice of gameplay from a 2001 demo of the game. The video’s authenticity was semi-confirmed on Twitter by Duke Nukem co-creator George Broussard, who served as one of the lead designers on Forever with 3D Realms during its long development.

From felling legends to taunting invaders, running around in Elden Ring with trusted pals never gets bland. And while many swear that From Software’s trial by fire loop is most rewarding when experienced solo, I’d argue the exact opposite. Boss fight difficulty is scaled to match party size, leading to more laughs and terror. Minions peppered throughout the world pack an exhilarating punch but are less frustrating to surmount. And dropping items for others makes character progression devilishly dynamic (my three Moonveils are a testament to this). \nBut somehow, multiplayer still feels like an afterthought. \nFrom Software’s PVE and PVP entail assisting so…",

          "description": "It's been 4525 days since James Cameron's Avatar was released in theaters, decimating box office records, and today, the trailer for its first of many sequels dropped online. \nAvatar: The Way of Water rejoins Jake Sully (in his now permanent Na'vi body) and his partner Neytiri over a decade after the first film's events. According to the film's description, the two now have a family with kids of their own, and The Way of Water is the first of many new stories to chronicle \"the trouble that follows them, the lengths they go to keep each other safe, the battles they fight to stay alive, and the tragedies they endure.\" Previously we got to see how the Na'vi live and thrive in the lush jungles on the planet of Pandora. This time we see how they fare on the coast, in the oceans, and of course, in the skies above it. The humans are still around, too, and look to be up to no good with armed Na'vi or Avatars in their ranks.\nThe trailer, which you can watch above, has plenty of grandeur, drama, and action. It brings back memories of how gorgeous the setting of Avatar is, and the last shot of the trailer shows Cameron hasn't forgotten how to make a cool action sequence. He is responsible for Terminator 2 and Aliens, after all. If I wasn't sold on the idea of more Avatar before the trailer, seeing Jake surf into the skies on a flying crocodile with a huge gun in hand and an ax on his back was more than enough for me to buy a ticket when presales go live later this year. \nAvatar: The Way of Water stars Zoe Saldana, Sam Worthington, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang, Cliff Curtis, Joel David Moore, CCH Pounder, Edie Falco, Jemaine Clement, and Kate Winslet. It will be released in theaters on December 16, and yes, there will be a 3D version.\nAre you excited about Avatar: The Way of Water?

Unfortunately for them, that will soon come to an end. \nThe WWE Games Twitter account tweeted that on June 30, the online functions for both of those games will be shut down. 2K explains that doing so allows the team to give its full attention to supporting 2K22. Once the shutdown occurs, 2K19/20 players will be unable to play online, download/upload user-created content, or interact with presumably any other feature dependant on the servers.   \n📣 Attention WWE 2K community: On June 30, 2022, we will sunset support for WWE 2K19 & WWE 2K20 servers. This includes all online functions, such as online matches & Community Creations. We are turning our full focus toward supporting #WWE2K22. Thanks for your continued support! pic.twitter.com/vOJ06AA9iy\nMay 9, 2022\nWhile 2K20 is largely remembered as a disaster, 2K19 was generally well-liked, but both games haven’t exactly maintained bustling online communities. The average Steam player count for both games currently sits between 90-130 players, so it’s easy to understand why 2K would feel justified in sunsetting online support.\nFurthermore, WWE 2K22 garnered positive reviews (here's ours) and recently received the first pack of DLC wrestlers of its months-long roadmap. On paper, it behooves the team to bolster a game perceived as a relative return to form with updates as much as it can. It's undeniably a bummer to lose such a big function of the old titles for preservation purposes, if nothing else, but at least fans have plenty of time to squeeze in some online match-ups before the final bell tolls.",

However, its co-op only supported up to two players. It seems that developer Warner Bros. Montreal, the studio behind Batman Arkham: Origins, might be looking to bump that number up. That’s because a new PSN listing for Gotham Knights lists the game as having four-player co-op, as reported by PCGamesN. \nAs you can see in the screenshot above (taken by Game Informer this morning), PlayStation lists the game as one that “supports up to 4 online players with PS Plus.” It even features the symbol and wording for “4 network players” beside that, further supporting the claim that Gotham Knights might feature four-player online co-op. However, as PCGamesN notes, the description for the game still says Gotham Knights can be experienced “in solo-play or with one other hero,” which sounds a lot like two-player co-op. \nPerhaps Warner Bros. Montreal has a surprise announcement up its sleeve, or maybe it is developing a mode separate from the campaign that supports four-player co-op. Only time will tell. \nFor more, check out this Gotham Knights gameplay walkthrough and then watch the latest trailer for Gotham Knights, which highlights the control of the Court of Owls. Read about how Gotham Knights was delayed to October after that. \n[Source: PCGamesN]\nDo you want four-player co-op in Gotham Knights? Let us know in the comments below!",

After seeing the game's title screen, a system alert appeared, telling me I wouldn't be able to play due to an online connection error. I knew my Xbox was connecting just fine since I could see all of the online functionality on the home screen. I assumed this alert was a boot-up hiccup – something I experience from time to time when reawakening my console. I reset my Xbox, tried to relaunch Fortnite, and just when it appeared to connect, I was booted out again, now receiving an alert that the person who owns this game needs to log in.\nI didn't blink an eye at it.

Thanos' reveal in The Avengers made my theater erupt with comic fans gasping over the potential of an Infinity Gauntlet story, and non-comic fans saying, \"Who was that purple guy?\"\nSince the movie is over at this point, people are freely chatting about the tease of note as the credits roll, and I've had many conversations with strangers to fill them in on who a character may be or why a particular …",

          "description": "Hearthstone Battlegrounds is but a few days away from a major shakeup. On May 10, Blizzard will be releasing pats 23.2, which includes the significant Rise of the Naga update for Hearthstone's auto battler. With it comes a new hero, Queen Azshara, and a brand new minion keyword called Spellcraft that gives the player temporary spells out of thin air each turn to buff their team of minions. \nSpeaking of minions, a new race of creatures will be coming with Rise of the Naga, and it will, of course, be the Naga themselves joining the fray. No longer will the Murlocs be the only amphibians making their presence known in the Battlegrounds. In total, Rise of the Naga will add 23 minions to the Battlegrounds pool of cards, all of which you can gaze upon below. \n\nSince Naga are the new hotness in Battlegrounds, that tribe will be receiving the most support, with 16 total Naga being added to the game. They'll mostly be the cards embued with Spellcraft, although there is one non-Naga with the ability. Five more minions of other types are joining the card pool as brand new minions, and two familiar faces will be making a return to the format. However, with all of these additions, there are going to be some subtractions; five minions will be retired from Battlegrounds as soon as patch 23.2 hits on Tuesday.\nHow much do you think the Naga will change the meta of Hearthstone Battlegrounds? Are you excited to play around with the Spellcraft mechanic? Let us know your thoughts on this big update in the comments below!",

One of this year's books is Clementine: Issue One by publisher Skybound Comet and Eisner and Ignatz award-winning writer and artist Tillie Walden.\nThis free book is surprisingly lengthy, giving readers 27 pages of Clementine's next story, as well as an interview with Walden. This story leads into Clementine: Book One, a graphic novel that releases in June. Here's the official product listing from Skybound for the forthcoming book:\nClementine is back on the road, looking to put her traumatic past behind her and forge new path all her own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            \n\n\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you run out to your comic shop today, make sure you also grab Marvels Judgement Day and Spider-Man/Venom, as well as DC's Dark Crisis.
