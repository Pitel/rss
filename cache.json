It's been an utter onslaught of leaks and rumours and noise as everyone clamours to find out about Nintendo's to-be-officially-announced console. C'mon Nintendo, it's really time to say something.\nAnyway, let's cut through the noise for a second. Here at Nintendo Life, some of us have been asking a big question — literally — about the Switch 2.

Why are we bringing this up as 'Switch 2' leaks reach fever pitch? Because accessory manufacturer Genki (the talk of the town this week) has claimed that a similar 'indentation' approach has been used to keep people from squeezing their new console into a 'Switch 1' dock (thanks, IGN).\nIn case you haven't graced the internet in the past 48 hours, Genki has taken this year's Consumer Electronics Show (CES) by storm, showcasing its upcoming accessories via a \"Switch 2 replica\". This model, which is allegedly based on the real thing and appears very much in line with what every other leak has suggested, has given us our best look yet at what 'Switch 2' might be (remember, Nintendo is still yet to officially reveal anything). What's more, the accessory manufacturer has been answering questions about it.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "One or two lumps of annoyance in your morning coffee? Okay, here's one. You'll need to link to a PlayStation Network account to play The Last Of Us Part II on PC, say Sony. The requirement was reported by Video Games Chronicle, and sure enough, the Steam page for the \"Remastered\" version of the third-person fungus fighter includes a footnote in the game description that confirms it in plain language - \"Account for PlayStation Network required\". For a lot of people this is a minor nuisance, for others it more likely means that the game won't be on sale in your country at all. Sony's reasons for enforcing the requirement remain obscure. \nRead more",

It turns out you can turn off a lot of the gore and nudity. You can also swaddle yourself in some nice, sturdy, PG-13 body armor. But you're seemingly stuck with a certain base percentage of bulging, softcore gratuitousness in both the character portrait on bottom left, and in the mildly boobulent background art of the world. I'm not sure I can put up with all that, which is a shame, because Beyond Citadel is otherwise a promising, eerie FPS that mixes ideas from 90s shooters in pretty appealing ways.\n Read more",

Coming soon to press that advantage are the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D, a pair of even higher-spec processors that headlined AMD’s plethora of CES 2025 hardware announcements.\nNo pricing (or exact release date) on these yet, but they both up the core and thread counts over the 9800X3D while peaking at higher boost clock speeds. And, of course, they share the same 3D V-Cache design that makes the 9800X3D such a superlative CPU in the first place. If you don’t know what this is and how it helps game performance, imagine how much faster you could eat Wotsits if you had a massive bucket of them on your desk at all times, instead of having to get up and walk to the kitchen to grab individual packs. In this case the Wotsits are data, the bucket is 3D V-Cache, and the hastened ruination of your digestive system is games running faster.\nRead more",

I think/hope it still exists somewhere in the apparatus of Green Man Gaming, hidden beneath the retailer's veneer of respectability like a barrel of radioactive waste. The other boob article was a piece for OXM about Ken Levine saying that he wished people would stop fixating on Elizabeth's cleavage in Bioshock Infinite - a complaint we might consider slightly hypocritical, given the character's visual design.\nNow it's time for boob article number 3: some modder has given 122 of the 150 Jokers in cardgame Balatro big chests. This extends from visibly human Jokers to Joker concepts that shouldn't, strictly speaking, have the capacity for boobage. The banana card has boobs, for example. The credit card card has boobs.

Where the ripple encounters larger masses, such as planets, suns and... other things, it rebounds, riding the weft of stardust back down to Earth. As it returns home, the signal is modified. Tinkered with. It acquires unsettling harmonics and a guttural undertow. By the time it re-enters our atmosphere, it has condensed to three words, which descend and shrink and spiral into your ear like an octopus entering a crevice: FEED THE MAW.\r\n \nRead more",

The longest novel ever written is generally agreed to be Proust’s Remembrance of Things Past - a coward’s pick, since it’s actually 13 different volumes. Don’t let Proust’s despicable lies sully the joy of literature for you, though. He did have a good quality moustache - a far more important literary trait than actually doing any writing, imo.\nThis week, it’s ITU Copenhagen Games Professor and Broken Rules co-founder, Martin Pichlmair!

As a concept, at least, SpaceCraft seems both flavourless and oddly inclined to overplay its own familiarity. I mean, look at that title. Consider its chilly blend of functionality and punmanship. Look at that capital \"C\", poking out of the middle like the bow on a present whose silhouette leaves nothing to the imagination. You already know broadly what this game involves, yes? Indeed, you do: it's a game about crafting spacecraft, so that you can travel to other planets and craft their resources into other, better spacecraft. This you may do eternally, for there are thousands of planets in store.\r\n \nRead more",

          "description": "I think the last time I read an actual, original Garfield comic was in 1998. Since then, my experience of the character has been one long litany of Gar-memes and in particular, Gorefield memes. For those blissfully unaware, Gorefield is a version of Jim Davis’s otiose, lasagna-loving housecat who has broken his comic strip shackles and become a cosmic abomination. Gorefield's manifestations are many: centipede Gorefields, arachnid Gorefields, Gorefields that extend serpentine necks of unfleshed bone towards a cowering Jon Arbuckle, demanding to be fed in a voice that sounds nothing like Bill Murray, a voice as deep and velvety as the eternal Monday before the Big Bang.\nIn Gar-Type, a free Gorefield fangame from Youtuber and pixel artist LumpyTouch, Garfield has become a planet. The good news is that, unlike many other Gore-variants, this Gorefield is vulnerable to bullets. It falls to ace pilot Jon Starbuckle and his prototype starfighter, Gar-Type D, to save the Earth from lasagnnihilation.\n Read more",

          "description": "Unlike a lot of the team I'd imagine, my opinion is this: I thought the year was quite middling for games. Or at least, it was middling for my own personal taste, which is quite unsavoury at the best of times. Most of my best picks made it into the calendar proper, but a couple didn't. One I hadn't even played properly until after the vote, and the other? The other is a flawed pick, but one that I couldn't stop thinking about.\nAnyway, hope you all have a restful Xmas folks and a cracking new year. I hope Santa bought you some nice warm socks or a chocolate orange so dense, you could tee it off at your local golf club.\nRead more",

Still, there are always a handful that don't quite make the cut, but still deserve a heaped Christmas plateful of praise at year's end.

I want to park my soul in the head of a scared Scotsman way out of his depth, hundreds of miles from shore. The closer I can comfortably fit in my character's shoes, the more I seem to buy into the world they inhabit. Even if that world is constantly glowing a magnificent crimson. \nRead more",

          "description": "My selection box isn't really a selection box. It's a tray of barely-nibbled leftovers, hastily lifted from my Steam backlog. One of the disadvantages of being news editor, you see, is that I have  developed a goldfish-grade attention span. In my hectic pursuit of the next scoop, or the next Elden Ring update changelog, I snatch and cast aside game demos like a pickpocket speedrunning the checkout line at Harvey Nichols. I'm dimly aware that some of these cast-aside games are Very Good. A few might even deserve to be played for longer than 30 minutes. I feel immensely guilty about that. Perhaps a little... existential, too. I have measured out my life in tutorial levels. \r\n\n\r\nSo! Rather than digging out three of the games I've actually completed this year, such as The Crush House, Death Of A Wish and Mask Quest, I'm going to gamble on recommending a few I've barely scratched, but which sure feel excellent and have attracted a positive critical consensus. If I am false in this assessment, may Horace the Endless Bear bite my head off for my impudence. Let's begin.\r\n\n \nRead more",

Between rising desktop component prices and ever-ballooning electricity bills, it would make sense that a smaller, cheaper system would take on a new appeal, and the success of handhelds like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally show that convenience still trumps out-and-out performance for a lot of PC players. There have even been hints that Valve are resurrecting their Steam Machine mini PC concept, years after a flopping first attempt. Should you be interested?\nRead more",

My weakest skeletons, sensing their death coming, explode into fire and shards. My strongest skeletons fight so hard and with such alacrity that upon dying, they drag their spirits together and keep fighting as ghosts for a while. Foul little bone scorpions skitter around on fans of legs made from human hands. Somewhere in the middle, almost invisible among the noise, is the character I am actually playing: Path of Exile 2’s mean-spirited, callous, and gleefully enjoyable Witch.\nThis is a review in progress. It has to be. Even in its incomplete early access period, Path of Exile 2 is a great sprawling mass of a game. Three meaty acts of a planned six act campaign are followed by a trickier return tour through them, before the absurd endgame kicks into gear and the real work begins. If I came to you having played everything on offer I would be wild-haired, bloodshot-eyed and possessing perfect, incomprehensible knowledge. Let’s compromise: I have toured the dark caverns and the antediluvian crypts. I have been killed by various accumulated nasties. I’ve had a great time.\nRead more",

          "description": "The announcement of The Witcher 4 with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's Ciri as protagonist has attracted a bit of discussion. Some of the reaction is online toddlers waxing wroth about a video game having a (somewhat older!!!) woman as lead character, and especially, shock, a video game in a series that has hitherto starred a man. And some of it is people commenting more thoughtfully on whether Ciri genuinely makes for a suitable Witcher protagonist, given that she isn't the product of the typical Witcher genetic modification regime (which is heavily tailored towards men), and given that, without spoiling too much, she has gifts that make crumbly old Geralt's sword-and-sorcery skillset look rather paltry. \r\n\n\nSpeaking to Eurogamer this week, game director Sebastian Kalemba and narrative director Philipp Weber responded to a few of these comments, and also shared a little about Ciri's situation at the start of the game.\r\n \nRead more",

Later, I examined the senator's personal history more thoroughly and discovered he was \"hated by bears for cooking them a rancid meal.\" I suppose every politician has their enemies. \nThat Caves Of Qud creates fun anecdotes out of simple encounters shouldn't be a surprise. It has had 15 years of early access to establish itself as a small-but-mighty story generating roguelike of repute (there's a reason it sits deservedly side-by-side with Dwarf Fortress in the same publishing house). After creating many characters, and dying and dying and dying again, I understand why it grips the brain with such fierce glee. It is a machine of grand imagination and adventuresome comedy. A deceptively powerful RPG that isn't half as obtuse to newcomers as the screenshots make it out to be. Qud's low-res bark is just a complement to its bite.\nRead more",

          "description": "It's been rumoured for a while that Sony are about to buy Kadokawa Corporation, a monolithic Japanese media conglomerate that means nothing to the bulk of you unless I append the magic words \"parent company of Dark Souls developers FromSoftware\" and possibly also, \"parent company of Spike Chunsoft\". Sony and Kadokawa were reported to be in talks last month, fomenting all sorts of speculation about, say, the PC version of Bloodborne being ritually sacrificed to consecrate the PS6-exclusivity of Dark Souls 4. Now, the pair have emerged from the Cave of Haggling and announced... \"a strategic capital and business alliance agreement\". What does this mean? Is it safe to scream yet?\r\n \nRead more",

Previously, on my mission to survive S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl with only wild mutants as my weapons, I’d discovered clues that someone else was attempting to tame the Zone’s beastly inhabitants. With one of their electronic tracking collars in hand and absolutely no preexisting knowledge of their location, I set out to find this kindred spirit, only for the Zone to once again slam a door in my face.\nA cold, steel, very literal door to boot. It turns out that the scientist’s laboratory is locked up tight, and will remain so until I delve about twenty hours deeper into the faction war that’s bubbled up while I’ve been running around throwing irradiated rats at people in tracksuits. Fine. Fine! But I’m keeping the collar.\nRead more",

But this year a modder began work on an overhaul that would grant the game pretty cel-shaded visuals. Since then the modding team has grown to 40 people and the scope of the mod's features has ballooned. It's now going to include new moves, stages, costumes, and a chaotic-looking 2v2 multiplayer tag team mode. All good news for biff 'em up sickos, as the mod is due to release on Friday. \nRead more",

Some of you unfamiliar with the series may be shrugging your shoulders right now. \"So what?\" you may say, \"we're still waiting on Half-Life 3.\" However, much like the elusive Half-Life installment, fans of the exploits of Adam Jensen also never got closure.\n\n\nYou see, Mankind Divided ended on a rather disappointing note, with the closing moments of the game strongly suggesting more was to come. However, it never emerged. As such, it's become a major sore point in Deus Ex's history, and the game's writer appears to agree.\n\n\n\n\nIn a recent interview on the YouTube channel \"From Script to Life\" (thanks, Kotaku), Mark Cecere – whose writing credits include the two Deus Ex reboots, Watch Dogs: Legi…",

          "description": "Despite releasing to PS5 in 2020, The Last of Us Part 2 is only just about coming to PC. On the one hand, it will be the remastered version when it is released (it's up to you to decide whether a four-and-half-year-old game even needs remastering). However, if you're planning to get your gritty zombie action on via Steam or Epic Games Store, you won't be able to escape Sony's clutch.\n\n\nAs noted by VGC, if you want to play The Last of Us Part 2 on PC, you'll need to connect a PlayStation Network account in order to do so. Indeed, if you look on the game's Steam page, you can see it says so on the right-hand column.\n\n\n\n\nThis is despite two things:\n\n\n\nTLoU is a single-player game, so it doesn't make sense to require a PSN account.\n\n\nA similar tactic was tried last year with Helldiver 2. Guess how that went down...\n\n\n\nIt seems Sony has learned nothing\n\n\nAs the report from VGC also points out, having to have a separate account in order to play through Steam or Epic renders the game useless in countries that don't have PSN. Obviously, this means a lot of people around the world won't be able to play The Last of Us Part 2 (remastered or not) when it comes to PC this April.\n\n\nWhile Sony has reneged on this decision in the past – doing a complete U-turn when it tried to introduce it to the aforementioned Helldiver 2 – the company also admitted it was \"still learning what is best for PC players.\" However, this doesn't appear to be the case if Sony goes forward with PSN requirements for a PC port of a single-player game.\n\n\nThere was also the incident in September 2024 when a mod for God of War Ragnarök removed the PlayStation Network requirement altogether. This alone should show how unpopular it is. Will Sony relent for The Last of Us Part 2? It seems well within its best interests to do so. Sadly, I have no influence over that decision.\n\nThe post The Last of Us Part 2 requires a PSN account if you want to play it on PC appeared first on Destructoid.",

It’s been a very long time since we had any new Trainer’s Cards as part of the collection, but the Journey Together Elite Trainer Box and expansion will introduce four new ones:\n\n\n\nN’s Zoroark ex\n\n\nLillie’s Clefairy ex\n\n\nIono’s Bellibolt ex\n\n\nHop’s Zacian ex\n\n\n\nThe box and expansion will be released under the title of “Battle Partners” in Japan on January 24, and will reach the west as the Journey Together box on March 28, with pre-purchase beginning two weeks earlier. \n\n\nImage via The Pokémon Center\n\n\nWhile the Trainer’s Pokémon cards are definitely the highlight of the upcoming release, there are plenty of other goodies in the set to be excited over. Along with the usual dice and counters, there will be 11 Journey Together booster packs included in the box. Each booster pack has a chance to produce the Trainer’s Pokémon cards listed above, as well as the following:\n\n\n\n16 Pokémon ex cards\n\n\n11 rare illustration cards\n\n\n6 special illustration cards\n\n\n3 hyper rare gold cards\n\n\n\nAs stated, Trainer’s Pokémon cards aren’t a new gimmick, but it’s interesting and more than a little exciting to see them making a comeback.

          "description": "Overflowing Palettes are a brand new type of puzzle found throughout all of Wuthering Waves 2.0, and they can be quite tricky to solve. If you're having trouble with them, here are a few tips and tricks you can use to get yourself closer to the solution.\n\n\nHow to Complete Overflowing Palettes in Wuthering Waves\n\n\nOverflowing Palette puzzles can be difficult to solve because the solution to them is not always obvious. More often than not, the color you need to switch all the blocks to is not the color you want to start using immediately. In most cases, the objective color is the last one you want to use after you've prepared all the other blocks to swap to that color.\n\n\nThe best way to approach these puzzles is with a focus on connectivity. Blocks are only recolored if they are, in some way, connected to each other. Since you only have two to three moves you can make, it is important to recognize how you can connect disconnected blocks in as few moves as possible.\n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nYou're aiming to connect everything together, in an Overflowing Palette puzzle, so that you can change all the disconnected blocks into one connected color. When everything is connected and colored, the puzzle becomes significantly easier to decipher because you know exactly which blocks will have their color altered when you aim to paint another color over them.\n\n\nAnother key aspect of this puzzle is reducing the number of colors in the puzzle itself. The more blocks of a different color present, the more difficult these puzzles are to finish. Ideally, this is your primary goal over everything else initially, and it ties in directly to what I mentioned earlier about coloring disconnected blocks. \n\n\nThese tips will help you solve every single Overflowing Palette puzzle available in Wuthering Waves 2.0, as they all follow the same core aspect of color control and connectivity. \n\nThe post How to solve Overflowing Palettes in Wuthering Waves 2.0 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Robot Arm is a very specific item you can find in Anime Last Stand, but it's also important to obtain if you're looking to evolve the Ninja character inspired by Nagato.\n\n\nThis item is specifically required for this one purpose, but it can be hard to obtain. Let's take a look at the best way to farm a Robot Arm in Anime Last Stand, followed by how to use it properly and efficiently.\n\n\nHow to get Robot Arms in Anime Last Stand\n\n\nAs of writing, there's only one way to get this particular item, and it's not even easy. You'll have to complete Stage 6 of the Leaf Village raid in Anime Last Stand, which is easier said than done. If you thought that managing to complete this stage and the raid was difficult, there's more bad news.\n\n\nOnce you complete the raid, there is a 3% chance for you to get Robot Arm, which is really low. Thankfully, there's a pity system that ensures that the probability increases in your favor if you don't obtain it. Once you clear this raid for the 30th time, you'll be guaranteed a Robot Arm from the drop. Of course, repeating the same activity 30 times can be tiring, but you're at least assured of the resource you're looking for.\n\n\n\n\nHow to use Robot Arms in Anime Last Stand\n\n\nThe Robot Arm is required when you want to evolve the Almighty Ninja (Paths) character. Evolving him will transform him into his Resurrected form, which is far more powerful than his Paths form. Both forms might be of Ultimate rarity, but Almighty Ninja (Ressurected) is on a different level.\n\n\nHence, it's certainly worth putting in the effort to get a Robot Arm, even if the task might be quite hard to complete.\n\nThe post Best ways to farm Robot Arms in Anime Last Stand appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "If you're someone just getting started in Dig It, applying mutations on your valuables could help you to get extra cash.\n\n\nThe core objective of the game is to use your Shovel to find valuables buried in the ground. While you can become wealthy by targeting more precious resources, you can also improve how much you get from the more ordinary ones. This can be done with the help of mutations, which makes it easier for you to get in-game money.\n\n\nAll Mutations in Dig It\n\n\nPut very simply, mutations increase the value of any item you can dig from the terrain with your Shovel. To use mutations, you'll have to appraise the object that you want to sell and improve its valuation. Here's the full set of all ten options available inside the game.\n\n\nMutations\nMultiplier\n\n\n\n\nWooden\nx1.1\n\n\nRusty\nx1.15\n\n\nHot \nx1.25\n\n\nBiodegradable \nx1.5\n\n\nFestive\nx1.5\n\n\nGolden\nx2\n\n\nNeon\nx2\n\n\nHoly\nx3\n\n\nMagma\nx3\n\n\nQuantum\nx5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to appraise in Dig It\n\n\nThe main issue with mutations is their random nature, as you can't predetermine which one you want on an object. To apply mutations, you'll have to appraise an object at Nookville Island. Go to the Central Junkyard and select the object you want to appraise.\n\n\nPay the required money, and the object will be thrown in a pit and then returned with a mutation. Remember that there are chances for it to return without any mutation as well, so make sure that you have extra cash in your inventory. If you're trying for Quantum, Magma, or Holy mutations, make sure to pray for extra luck.\n\nThe post Complete list of Mutations in Dig It appeared first on Destructoid.",

There's an expiry date to the event, however, and a new one will replace it in the future.\n\n\nWhen does the next Royale High Halo event begin?\n\n\nThe exact date of the next Royale High Halo event remains unknown.

The Everfriend Halo should have appeared in February, but it went live on January 6. This makes it quite possible for the Spring Halo to be pushed out in March 2025. That said, I still believe the first week of April is a likelier release date.\n\n\n\n\nThe developers have made a few changes to the usual pattern when it comes to the usual release pattern.

Here’s a shiny new package for you to unwrap, containing the first beta version of the upcoming OpenTTD 15 release. It comes faster, with road waypoints, fewer passwords, better scenario editor, and hopefully with a lot less bugs. To be a bit less vague, here are some of the highlights: Improved picker windows for stations/waypoints/objects/and more. Oh, and that does include road waypoints. Better perfomance in various places, including faster path signals that are now green by default. Password-less network authentication using keys. Several improvements for NewGRFs regarding cargo support. Better scenario editor with a town data importer and manual house placement. A large tree fully hung with ornamental bugfixes. Sadly though, not everbody was good this year. The old NPF pathfinder was finally retired, after YAPF being the superior default for many, many years now. There’s a lot of bugs left for you to find, though, guaranteed. Enjoy the beta, test all the things and report anything you find amiss, to make OpenTTD 15 the best OpenTTD 15 ever.

Hudebně vychází z původní lidové písně a již dávno zažité sestupné basové linky původně inspirované čardášem. V monumentální instrumentaci zaznívá důstojné a bohaté \"hradní\" Maestoso s výraznou smyčcovou figurací a dramatické Presto s vypjatým protihlasem tak kontrastně jako dunajské nížiny a Vysoké Tatry. Důvodem vzniku bylo hledání krásy a síly slovenské hudby s duchovním nadhledem mně tolik blízké mahlerovské angažovanosti. Velmi důležitá při tom pro mě byla noblesa a hudební kultivovanost při zachování původní písně. Nový rozměr je u mě h…",
