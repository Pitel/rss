You know, as opposed to a wall of Funko Pops, a chair with blinking lights, and a cabinet of secondhand Samsung Galaxies.\nGame magazines are another thing we miss. There are still some stalwart publications hanging in there, thankfully, and there's something intimate and special about holding print in your hands and poring over physical pages for your gaming news and reviews.

          "description": "Prematurely hatched.\nEver since Nintendo gave players the tools to develop their own levels with Super Mario Maker, there’s been talk about the Big N expanding the concept to other franchises, especially Zelda. This was allegedly discussed at greater length behind the scenes and eventually led to the addition of the Chamber Dungeons concept in the Link’s Awakening Switch remake, but there seemingly wasn’t enough will or interest to see it through to a fuller product, as we haven’t seen anything come to fruition yet. Spotting an opportunity to capitalize on the potential of this idea, an indie team called Firechick launched and successfully funded a Kickstarter late last year for a legally distinct top-down Zelda-style dungeon builder called Super Dungeon Maker. Now that it’s come to Switch, we can report that it’s a decent foundation, though it feels unfinished at launch and there’s clear room for improvement here.\nFirst, a brief overview. This is a game that apes the gameplay of the Game Boy and SNES Zelda games as closely as possible, right down to that annoying worm boss that spins in circles in a cramped room. Instead of playing as Link, you play as a chicken named Fink who has the same basic sword and shield alongside a small arsenal of tools like a hookshot or bombs. Using these, you navigate dungeons, solve puzzles, and kill baddies, all in the quest to find the golden egg at the end of each dungeon.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "Take one look at Luna Abyss and you'll probably go, 'Wait a minute, this looks like first-person Returnal!' And having played the first mission of the game at GDC, I can confirm that yes, this is very much in the vein of first-person Returnal. It's a fast-paced, bullet hell shooter set on a strange alien moon where everything's out to get you, but the shift in perspective makes everything in its titular abyss feel closer and more intimate, calling to mind the frantic, confined gun fights of Doom and Quake more than Housemarque's seminal roguelike - games that creative director Benni Hill tells me were formative experiences for him growing up. \nThere's also a greater emphasis on story-telling in Luna Abyss, with Hill also citing Nier: Automata and Bioshock as other key influences. It's a compelling mix, based on the first chunk I played, and arguably one of my surprise GDC favourite demos alongside The Thaumaturge and The Lamplighters League. Indeed, Hill tells me they started working on Luna Abyss a year before Returnal was even announced, and when they first saw it during Sony's PlayStation 5 reveal stream in the summer of 2020, he and his team did a collective double-take.\nRead more",

I can just about (by the skin of my teeth) make a profitable park, but my god, that park will have the worst layout you've ever seen in your cursed, vomiting in the bins at a Disneyland life. But look, if the park works, it works, right? The shareholders can't complain!\nThing is, much like with the internet or your mum's relationship with the binman, theme park simulators can really change while you're not paying attention. While part of Park Beyond's selling point is making literally impossible rides via the aptly-named method of Impossification (an upgrade to rides you buy by spending units of amazement gleaned from your slack-jawed guests, in order to strap a canon to a rollercoaster), I really was not prepared for how simulation-y the simulation bits are.\nRead more",

          "description": "\"What will ye do, when steel hearts break, and courage does abscond?\" reads the penultimate line of The Pale Beyond’s poetic prologue. Actually, it’s less of a poem and more a call to action: how on earth will you keep a ragtag bunch of sailors alive in the harshest conditions on the planet? If you hadn’t already twigged, The Pale Beyond is a narrative survival sim that puts you in the frostbitten boots of First Mate aboard The Temperance - a coal guzzling steam ship that set out on a polar expedition in search of its sister, The Viscount, which went missing five years prior. As Captain Hunt’s second-in-command, you’ll take daily requests from the crew, manage the food rations, and settle petty squabbles on the poop deck.   \r\n\n\r\nBeginning life as a way for co-founders Michael Bell and Thomas Hislop to create World of Warcraft mods, Bellular Studios grew alongside its gaming and Warcraft YouTube channels into a fully-fledged development team based out of their hometown of Belfast, Northern Ireland. The Pale Beyond is their debut game that fittingly draws on Ireland’s rich maritime history, although, as Hislop tells me, this wasn’t always the plan. \"We initially didn’t set out to do so, but it quickly emerged as a core influence that we kept finding ourselves drawn back to,\" he says. \"The further we delved into the golden age of exploration, and its very local routes, the more it resonated with us personally.\"  \r\n\n \nRead more",

When Firaxis were designing the moveset for each hero, creative director Jake Solomon says he and fellow lead game designer Joe Weinhoffer would take turns being \"point designers\" for certain characters. \"Joe was point designer on one hero, I was point designer on another hero,\" Solomon says, highlighting Magic and Iron Man as two of his own favourite heroes that he designed. \nBoth are what I'd call quite technical heroes, with Magic relying on careful battlefield placement to boot enemies into nifty magical portals, while Iron Man's most powerful abilities often only come from discarding other cards. But when I ask Solomon at GDC if he thinks he has a particular design 'style' that unites his crop of Marvel heroes, he says he loves being \"bombastic\".\nRead more",

Park Beyond is not just a complex theme park management sim, or a physics-ish coaster builder (although it is both of those), it's also an anti-physics weird-ride expando-game, allowing you to unlock increasingly unrealistic upgrades for rides in a process the developers Limbic Entertainment call \"impossification\".

Well, Arma 3 developers Bohemia Interactive are taking a punt at blending the two genres with Silica, in the hopes that you can both shoot and command things with equal levels of good. It's the first project to hatch from Bohemia's incubator program, which helps indie devs make cool games.\nSilica is largely the work of one developer, Martin \"Dram\" Malicharek, who was previously the lead on Bohemia's Take On Mars. Having given Silica a whirl for over an hour, I struggle to see whether the RTS, FPS hybrid can truly offer the best of both worlds. It does, however, make being a crab extremely good.\nRead more",

Plenty of options, for sure, but Persona 3 Portable was the last time we could choose our protagonist’s gender in the series. Until now.

          "description": "Marvel's Midnight Suns may be a turn-based tactics game first and foremost, but it also has a substantial RPG element that drives both the story and the interpersonal dramas of its superhero teams between missions. When you and your squad head back to your Abbey HQ, there are side stories and quests to investigate around the Abbey grounds, items to find, and more. It's a sizable part of the game, but at one point it was even bigger, creative director Jake Solomon tells me at GDC. \n\"It's crazy, if you go online, you can see all the Midnight Suns cutscenes and they're three hours long. That's as long as a movie,\" he says. But during the last year of development Solomon reveals \"we cut 30 conversations from the game, like 30 scenes. We cut a ton, because we realised this is just simply too much.\"\nRead more",

I was all about the chocolate. Sure, I’d crack open the yellow canister inside, let out some variation of, “Oh, an elephant!”, and promptly toss it in the bin and walk away, its destiny consigned to landfill. In the landfill of my brain, I’m currently carving out new space for Street Fighter 6’s World Tour mode. It's available to try now in demo form on PC and consoles, but I've been able to play a larger build of it that covered the first two chapters. Sadly, I can't say it left much of impression.\nIn case you're equally bemused by what SF6's World Tour actually is, this is a new, open world, RPG-style mode in which you make a custom fighter, run around small areas of Metro City and other locations around the globe, and level up. There are moves to learn, side quests to complete, and you can even do mini-game activities such as making pizza. Between all of that, you fight people. Other fighters, unruly gang members, random folk making their way to work in the morning. You can punch almost all of ‘em! There’s a glimpse of the Street Fighter you know and love here with its side-on 1v1 bouts, but everything else around it is unnecessary fluff. In other words, World Tour is the token toy inside the more delicious Street Fighter chocolate. \nRead more",

They're overhauling things like the in-game overlay, creating a new toolbar to house achievements, friends chat and discussions, and creating a new hub that shows you everything that's happened in the game's community since you last played it. It also introduces a cool pin feature that lets you stick overlay windows on top of your game - handy if you're following a guide, say, and don't want to keep alt-tabbing out. But there's one thing I'm quite upset about, and that's the new Notes app. I love a good notebook game, you know? Fiddling out puzzles in Tunic, remembering patterns in The Witness...

Sluggishness and stuttering are problems on higher-end graphics cards, even before adding the strain of ray tracing effects, and FSR upscaling often fails to deliver a significant performance boost.\r\n\n \nRead more",

It's well-known now that the delay was simply about polishing the game rather than anything more drastic, but to Solomon's credit he does also concede that he was perhaps \"a little naïve\" at the time for thinking it would go down without question.\nRead more",

Played less intensely over a longer period, I imagine more of its intricacies becoming clear, and more custom playstyles emerging to encourage more replays and challenges. As it stands though, its generally high quality and interesting systems just haven't captured my imagination.\nIt is not unimaginative, though. Some of its playable races are the usual elves and goblins, but most have a twist, like the cannibalistic dwarves, gold-obsessed necromancers, or the \"cursed toadlings\" I picked almost reflexively: a people transformed along with their warrior Queen Charming. Each comes with a starting hero and traits for their cities units, plus a set of spellbooks that determine what research you'll have access to upfront.\nRead more",

I see a flicker of anger in her eyes, as well as maybe, just maybe, a spark of interest.\r\n\n\r\nA new Dota patch came out last week, and it’s a biggun. Is it a good time for lapsed players to jump back in? Yes!

          "description": "When I meet Jake Solomon at GDC, it's his third day of unemployment. The XCOM and Marvel's Midnight Suns director and designer announced he was leaving Firaxis back in February, but his final day at the studio where he made his name and worked for more than twenty years was still very fresh in his memory. \"It's surreal,\" he says. \"For probably the next ten years, I'll refer to it as 'we' when we talk about Firaxis, and it's sad to think it's not the right pronoun anymore. It's exciting, but a little terrifying.\"\nOn the face of it, that panic might seem unfounded. Over the last decade, Solomon has become one of the most revered names in turn-based strategy games. Having cut his teeth on many of Sid Meier's Civilization games in his early years at Firaxis, he went on to become the designer who spearheaded the revival of XCOM with Enemy Unknown in 2012, before going on to direct its even more beloved sequel XCOM 2 and its War Of The Chosen expansion a few years later. Most recently, he was creative director on Marvel's Midnight Suns, which allowed him to marry his life-long love of Marvel comic books with the thrilling tactical combat he's so well known for. \nSolomon's next adventure, though, won't have the certainty of Midnight Suns' supercharged attack cards, or even the tease of an XCOM hit percentage backing him up. For not only is it Solomon's third day of unemployment when we speak; it's also the day after he revealed his plans to leave turn-based tactics games behind altogether. Instead, his sights are now set on the life simulation genre, a move that, at first glance, seems at odds with his career as a strategy designer. But over the course of our hour-long chat, it becomes increasingly clear that life sims have been a life-long obsession for Solomon, and he might have even made one by now had the development of XCOM 2 gone a little differently. \nRead more",

Somehow, despite being primed by the excellent time I had with its demo five years ago, I just bounced off this one. I very quickly got stuck in a frustrating loop of fatally ballsing up no matter what I did - presumably I badly biffed my stats right out the gate to get soft-locked in the first area - and despite deciding I'd restart in a day or two, several years later my play-time hasn't extended past that first session. Sad times all round, I'm sure you'll agree, but what's it got to do with Betrayal At Club Low?\nWell, when I picked up Betrayal At Club Low for the RPS Game Club this month, I was transported back to my abortive run at Disco Elysium. It's not that I've never played a stat-check-heavy RPG before. Far from it. But somehow, each game's presentation resonated together in my weird brain mush. It must have been something to do with the combination of a surreal, seedy, not-quite-our-world-but-still-very-recognisable setting, and the constant presence of numbers reminding me of my character's strengths stacked up against their many, many weaknesses.\nRead more",

It’s pretty clear that Kafka isn’t a hero, but they’ve woken you up, and since you’ve got no memories, you must be one of the good guys.

Problém byl identifikován na některých noteboocích platformy Intel Comet Lake a bylo těžké jej debuggovat. Až Mika Westerberg z Intelu vedoucí vývoj zaměřující se na podporu Thunderboltu, který dnes typicky po USB běhá, dostal do ruky inkriminovaný hardware a všiml si, že jde o chybu týkající se xHCI řadiče Intel Titan Ridge a řešení je vpravdě jednoduché.",

          "description": "From turtles and cars to one man's mountain\nApple's mobile gaming subscription service Apple Arcade is getting a fresh batch of new games. Today, Apple revealed 20 new games coming to the subscription service.\nOne of the leaders of the pack is TMNT Splintered Fate, a co-op roguelike adventure starring the turtles. The crew is searching for Splinter, and will journey around New York City looking for clues while also picking up randomized power-ups.\nTriband, the studio behind What the Golf? and What the Bat?, is also here with What the Car? It's a fittingly quirky take on motor vehicles, the kind that Triband has been especially good at over its other games.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5wx0Takylc\nEven more are on the docket, including some familiar faces like Getting Over It and Limbo. Here's the full list of today's games:\nGames coming to Apple Arcade, May 2023\nTMNT Splintered Fate\nDisney SpellStruck\nWhat the Car?\nCityscapes: Sim Builder\nChess Universe+\nDisney Coloring World+\nDisney Getaway Blast+\nFarming Simulator 20+\nGetting Over It+\nHill Climb Racing+\nIron Marines+\nKingdom Two Crowns+\nPlaydead's Limbo+\nMy Town Home - Family Games+\nOctodad: Dadliest Catch+\nPPKP+\nSnake.io+\nTemple Run+\nTime Locker+\nVery Little Nightmares+\nIt's a pretty solid lineup, with some familiar faces and neat new additions in there. I personally like the idea of seeing someone trying to make their way up the hill of Bennett Foddy's Getting Over It, and the ensuing frustration, in mobile form.\nApple Arcade has had some pretty stellar games hit the service over the years, from Hironobu Sakaguchi's Fantasian to the recent mobile version of Game Freak's Pocket Card Jockey. I'm certainly curious to see if some more hits await in this update.\nThe post Apple Arcade adds 20 new games to its lineup appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The DMCA claims another court victory\nBungie has succeeded in the latest of an increasing line of lawsuits targeting online cheat sellers — The Destiny 2 developer was awarded $12 million in damages this week in its case against website VeteranCheats and its owner, Mihai Claudiu-Florentin.\nAs reported by The Game Post, Bungie filed suit against Romanian Claudi-Florentin in 2021, accusing the website owner of committing copyright infringement and tortious interference through the development selling of various hacks and cheats, distributed through the VeteranCheats domain. The key software allows players to see through walls and auto-aim, alongside other in-game advantages.\nBungie argued that the sale of VeteranCheats had caused significant harm to Destiny 2 and its community, frustrating users and undermining the game's intent. Bungie sought default judgment of just over $12 million USD, including statutory damages of $2,000 for each of the cheat's 5,848 downloads, as well as an additional $146,000 for copyright violation, and payment for the studio's legal fees.\nThe District Court of Washington found in favor of Bungie's claim, and ordered a total damage reparation of $12,059,912.98. In addition, Claudi-Florentin was barred from engaging in any activity that opposes Bungie's copyright act and DMCA rulings. As of this writing, the VeteranCheats website is still operational, selling cheats for other popular video games including Call of Duty and PUBG. The Destiny 2 hacks, obviously, have since been removed.\nThis lawsuit represents the latest of a series of successful suits Bungie has filed against online cheat sellers, having previously won damage cases against companies such as AimJunkies, LaviCheats, and Elite Boss Tech.\nBungie Wins $12 Million Award Against Destiny 2 Cheat Seller [The Game Post / GamesIndustry.biz]\nThe post Bungie awarded $12 million in latest Destiny 2 cheat seller lawsuit appeared first on Destructoid.",

Just boxing.\nTuatara Games have dropped their multi-player alien-smacker, Bare Butt Boxing, on Early Access today.\nBare Butt Boxing is a physics-based fighting game. You don the big padded gloves of punching and duke it out with a fleet of other aliens doing the same. The goal is to clobber your friends and family enough to launch them into conveniently supplied portals to get points. There’s a veritable charcuterie of boxing arenas to throw down in, each with unique hazards and quirks.\nhttps://youtu.be/1eSIWYGq4fo\nI’m getting some real Gang Beasts vibes from Bare Butt Boxing, only less chaotic. There’s always a bit of chaos when you lean on physics, I’m just not sure that anyone here is going to get thrown into a grinder and be turned into a sausage.\nBare Butt Boxing comes to us from the esteemed developers of 2017’s Let Them Come. Needless to say, their follow-up goes in quite a different direction by presenting an alien’s take on the gentleman’s sport. It looks like some quick fun that might be a good time if you break it out at a family event. If you’re like me, and everyone in the neighborhood has a restraining order against you, there’s online play. That way, you can go fist-to-fist against strangers who don’t know about your sordid past.\nBare Butt Boxing is currently available exclusively on Steam Early Access. However, the plan is to release it on Switch, PS4, and PS5 when it hits version 1.0. Right now, the developers are planning on 10-12 months in Early Access.\nThe post Bare Butt Boxing throws gloves today on Early Access appeared first on Destructoid.",

Blessed with the ability of \"soul-jumping\", Tchia is able to leap into the bodies of other sentient and inanimate beings, using the speed, agility, and abilities of these creatures and items in order to navigate the world and overcome its obstacles. Tchia is also \"armed\" with a magical ukelele, which she can use to alter the game world, summoning animals, changing the time of day and weather, and affecting the landscape itself.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBhlxXbcyC4&ab_channel=Awaceb\nWith its unique concepts, cartoonish and expressive visuals, and overall wholesome vibe, Tchia won over critics and fans, receiving mostly positive response from both. Already available to purchase in digital form, Maximum Games has announced that it will be releasing a physical edition on PS4 and PS5 on July 18, which should be readily available online and from high street retailers, which will no doubt add to Tchia impressive sales record.

Blizzard has already told us that they expect it to take \"around 80 hours\" to complete each Battle Pass, and that a Diablo IV season is expected to last in the region of around three-to-four months.

While the game itself was serviceable, with high-octane action and an appetite for destruction, many critics and fans were non-plussed at the reboot's general vibe, complaining about a dated mission design, obnoxious and offputting dialogue, as well as a slew of technical issues.\nDeveloper Volition has been releasing updates to correct the latter problems, which has led to this long delay between launch and DLC drops. Soon after release, it was announced that Volition was being transferred from Deep Silver to another Embracer Group publisher, Gearbox Entertainment.\nSaints Row is available now on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox. But not Stadia. Not anymore.\nThe post Saints Row DLC, The Heist and The Hazardous, finally arrives next week appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Hope there's a Homer comeback\nSquare Enix has announced a release date for In Tanta We Trust, the DLC expansion for its mythical adventure title Forspoken — The new campaign content will arrive May 26 on PC and PS5.\nWhile the action-packed trailer doesn't offer much in the way of context, we can see that Frey Holland, now truly coming to terms with the incredible powers afforded her in the kingdom of Athia, has been seemingly joined on the battlefield by no less than Tanta Cinta herself. The two magic-infused warriors will face new enemies and threats as they search for a way to purge Athia of the energy-sucking anomaly known as \"The Break\". Players can expect an extension to Athia's already huge map, as well as new spells, skills, friends and foes. Will we get new cat familiars? I hope so.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uc1xcGp1PyM&ab_channel=SquareEnix\nAm I going to die on the Forspoken defense hill? No, I am not, the moment has passed and fate has made its decision. But that doesn't mean that I agree with all of the flack directed towards what was, essentially, a perfectly fine adventure with some excellent stand-out setpieces and some lovely world and character design. While hardly the most original of open-world adventures, I really liked the synergetic combat, I really liked the costuming and special effects, and... fact is... I really liked Frey.\nIn Tanta We Trust will, quite possibly, be the last we ever hear from the Forspoken franchise, given its disappointing sales, and combined with the fact that developer Luminous Productions has essentially been assimilated into Square Enix proper. If so, I hope that Frey, Athia, and, of course, Homer, are all given a fitting finale that sends the audience home happy.\nForspoken is available now on PS5 and PC. In Tanta We Trust will launch on May 26.\nThe post Forspoken DLC In Tanta We Trust swings in May 26 appeared first on Destructoid.",

It will stream out over Twitch, YouTube, and Facebook, and have an ASL stream option available as well.\nhttps://twitter.com/Xbox/status/1653754086372818944\nWhat's it showing? Well, for the Xbox Games Showcase, Microsoft is making it sound like there will be some announcements. There will be \"new surprises and first-looks\" from its internal studios, as well as partners from around the world. The showcase will also discuss games coming to Xbox, PC, and to Game Pass.\nAs for the Starfield Direct, well, it's going to be about Starfield. Bethesda's big RPG is still a ways off, but getting closer every day. Xbox says there will be tons of new gameplay and developer interviews.\nThen, on June 13, Microsoft will air the Xbox Games Showcase Extended at 10 a.m. PT / 1 p.m. ET. This stream will host some interviews based around the news from the showcase,  as well as game updates.\nThe summer game showcases draw near\nWe're only a few days into May, but the time period for summer streams and news is now just a month away. The PC Gaming Show is set to follow right after the Xbox showcase, Ubisoft is airing its 2023 Forward the day after, and the Summer Game Fest kick-off stream will air on June 8.\nThough Nintendo, Sony, and a few other companies still have yet to lock in any summer plans as of this writing, the summer's already starting to stack up. Even in a year without E3, it seems like June will have some news and announcements in store.\nIt will be interesting to see what Xbox brings to its summer games showcase event, especially as Redfall didn't land quite so well for some folks.

          "description": "Hug a tree\nTHQ Nordic has announced that furry open-world exploration game Biomutant will be coming to Switch on November 30, 2023.\nBiomutant originally launched on other platforms on May 21, 2021. It drops you and your hideously ugly fursona in a post-apocalyptic world where your goal is to maybe save the world tree if you think that’s a good idea. For the most part, it was very open-world and put an emphasis on crafting and exploration.\nI liked it. Maybe one of the few, I think. I enjoyed the exploration, thought the world presented a nice amount of variety, and the crafting system is one of the best I’ve seen. Not only could you build weapons, you could take them apart and make them into better weapons. I don’t need to excuse myself for liking a game that other people bounced off of, but if I wanted to, 2021 was absolutely depressing. Any spark of joy just glowed brighter.\nI’m not really sure how this is going to look on Switch. It uses Unreal Engine 4, which has built-in compatibility with the Switch. However, I feel like you’re going to need to substantially cut back on the vegetation and fur, and I’m not sure a naked version of Biomutant is going to look so hot. Still, gameplay-wise, it should be the same. We’re pretty far removed from the days when games needed to be scaled back to fit on handheld.\nBiomutant is currently available on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. It will be coming to Switch on November 30, 2023.\nThe post Biomutant mutates on Switch November 30 appeared first on Destructoid.",

Marian joins the brothers, after becoming tired of bad guys constantly carrying her off. Meanwhile, I hope Uncle Matin is actually their uncle. There’s reportedly going to be a total of 13 playable characters, but the gameplay only supports two-player local coop. That’s probably a bummer for a lot of people, but I’m okay with it. I don’t like playing games with people who are out of Charlie Horse range.\nThe big combat change here is that it’s all “tag team combat.” You select two characters and can switch between them freely. There are co-op combos and other moves to pull off between your pair.\nhttps://youtu.be/TVvlBr6hVXA\nSecret Base is best known for Streets of Red: Devil’s Dare Deluxe. They’re applying a twist to the main campaign of Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons. You select the order you'll tackle the levels, and that will affect the length and difficulty of the following stages. You can also gain cash by performing special KOs and upgrade your fighter.\nThis is, by my count, the dozenth return of the series following 2012’s Double Dragon Neon and 2017’s Double Dragon IV. Secret Base seems to be bringing their own style to the series, so it should stand out from other revivals. I dig the art style, and the animations really pop.\nWe won’t have to wait long, as Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons releases this summer on Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.\nThe post Bimmy and Jimmy set to return this summer in Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons appeared first on Destructoid.",

Utilizing a top-down perspective and with a heavy emphasis on exploration, combat, and environmental interaction, Weird West was praised for its pulpy writing, creepy character design, and interesting world, though some of its action and technical elements gave critics pause.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NS3lzv0Nw4&ab_channel=DevolverDigital\nWeird West: Definitive Edition will see the game launch on modern platforms, boasting new 4K resolution options and running at 60 FPS. Hopefully, with these visual upgrades and the power of Gen 9, some of the game's stiffer creases will be ironed out. Here's hoping, as Weird West is certainly charming in its own peculiar way, and any fans of alternate realities, old-school horror comics, or twin-stick action would do well to test the murky waters of Wolfeye's adventure.\nWeird West: Definitive Edition launches May 8 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X.

From today's trailer, it looks like Ekko will be interacting with his future self, as well as rewinding time in the short-term too, in order to foil some catastrophe.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qqdGiHBStk\nConvergence's platforming and action also makes use of Ekko's unique time abilities. From gaining an advantage over foes to rewinding a missed jump, it definitely feels like something Prince of Persia: Sands of Time should be keeping an eye on.\nThe story follows Ekko through the undercity of Zaun too, so Arcane fans should get a little bit more out of this than other locales. But of course, there are champions to fight too. Alongside Ekko, three other champions have been confirmed: Jinx, Camille, and Warwick.\nTime after time\nIt feels like only yesterday that The Mageseeker, the latest Riot Forge production, came out. While that one followed the magical rebellion happening within Demacia, Ekko's exploits in Zaun will be a bit different, both in setting and gameplay.\nAll of these, as well as the upcoming Song of Nunu, are part of Riot Games' publishing arm Forge. The idea has been to expand the world of League of Legends through third-party projects, and so far, it seems like it's been doing alright. Games like The Mageseeker and Ruined King were solid, fresh approaches to Runeterra. Maybe the streak can keep up with Convergence.\nConvergence: A League of Legends Story goes live for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on May 23.\nThe post Convergence: A League of Legends Story rewinds the clock on May 23 appeared first on Destructoid.",

The entire collection finally arrived on PlayStation and Nintendo Switch just last month, and consists of legendary releases Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy II, Final Fantasy III, Final Fantasy IV, Final Fantasy V and, you guessed it, Final Fantasy VI. The new console reports have received praise from both critics and fans alike.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bI80df5OrA&ab_channel=FINALFANTASY\nEach release sees the games that defined a genre sharpened up for modern displays, while retaining the nostalgic and warmth-inducing sprites and environments of their 8-bit and 16-bit roots, overseen by original artist Kazuko Shibuya. Audio has been restored by composer Nobuo Uematsu, and a fresh run of balance tweaks and bug fixes have been made to the releases, fixing issues that have existed — in some cases — for nigh-on four decades. The console editions of the games include the option to switch to each title's classic soundtrack, as well as utilize an easier-on-the-eyes \"pixel font\".\nThe Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series is available now on PC, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, and iOS and Android platforms.\nThe post Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series passes two million sales mark appeared first on Destructoid.",

Harmony: The Fall of Reverie is a choice-driven adventure starring Polly, a woman who returns home to find her missing mother. It's here Polly discovers she has clairvoyant abilities connecting her to a strange dimension called Reverie. While visiting this world, Polly becomes Harmony and encounters six powerful god-like beings called Aspirations, which serve as the hearts of humanity such as Glory, Power, Chaos, Bliss, and Truth. \n\n\nPolly must restore the balance between Reverie and our world and decide which Aspiration ultimately inspires humanity by making decisions represented by a system called the Augural. This web presents a multitude of scenes players will jump between that reveal possible futures that, in turn, unlock additional story branches. Polly does this by collecting crystals given to her with each choice and character bond she makes, which are used to unlock nodes on the Augural that alter the course of the story. \nHarmony: The Fall of Reverie sports a vibrantly illustrated art direction and a soundtrack by award-winning composer Lena Raine. You can try it out early thanks to a limited-time Steam demo launching today that will be available until May 21.\nFor more on Don't Nod, check out its other new title, Banishers: Ghosts of a New Eden, which also launches later this year.",

This new co-op brawler is coming this summer and will revitalize the dormant series in a new tag-team-focused adventure.\nSet in New York City after it’s been destroyed by nuclear war, Billy and Jimmy must take back what remains from the violent gangs that have since taken over. They won’t be doing it alone, though. The game features 13 playable characters, including Marian, the brothers’ old love interest, who now packs a pistol to blast threats from afar, and newcomer Uncle Matin, a tank-like fighter with a riot shield. \n\n\nAccording to a press release, Double Dragon Gaiden boasts “seamless tag team abilities and a multitude of strategies for devastating combos, defensive and offensive moves.” Solo players can swap characters on the fly to switch between their individual skills, such as the offense-focused Jimmy and more defensive Billy. The game supports two-player local co-op at launch (online co-op is coming in a post-launch update). \nDouble Dragon Gaiden tasks players with toppling four gang leaders and features a unique dynamic mission select system. Missions can be tackled in any order, and this selection affects their length, difficulty, and the number of enemies that appear. Earning cash unlocks powerful special movies that instantly knock out enemies, and you can also obtain crowd control moves that can wipe out multiple foes. Other gameplay options include an adjustable difficulty, permadeath and infinite modes, and unlockable bonuses. \nDouble Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons is being developed by Secret Base and published by Modus Games.

Today, Firaxis announced that the PS4 and Xbox One versions will launch next week on May 11, which is the same day the game's fourth and final DLC – Blood Storm, which introduces Storm as a playable hero – releases. \nAs for why the Switch version has been canceled, Firaxis doesn't provide anything more than, \"Note that a Nintendo Switch version of Marvel's Midnight Suns is no longer planned.\" This follows news from earlier this year that the game's director (and the director of Firaxis' modern XCOM games), Jake Solomon, is departing from the studio. \nPS4 and Xbox One players that purchase the Legendary Edition of Midnight Suns or the game's Season Pass will get the new Blood Storm DLC as well as all previously released DLC, which alongside Storm adds Deadpool, Morbius, and Venom to the game.\nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Marvel's Midnight Suns review. \nHave you played Marvel's Midnight Suns?

There’s no information about what this next title entails, but the team promises to reveal more in the “near future.” The coming days serve as a celebration for Citizen Sleeper, with the game receiving a 33 percent discount on PC and Switch starting May 4. \nCitizen Sleeper is a sci-fi choice-driven adventure where players guide a robot possessing a human consciousness through life on a space station, fighting for survival while also helping the lives of its inhabitants. In our review, we scored the game a 9 out of 10, with editor Wesley LeBlanc writing that \"Its hopeful and inspiring message is backed by a branching, heartfelt narrative, and a great gameplay loop, making it tough to put down. Add in its enriching visual style and my favorite musical score of 2022 so far, and Citizen Sleeper is a game I'll be thinking about for years to come.\" Citizen Sleeper also earned a spot on our Top 10 Games of 2022. \nCitizen Sleeper is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC.",

The film tells the true story of Jann Mardenborough, a British professional race car driver who began his career by winning GT Academy, a European televised contest that pitted the best Gran Turismo players against each other for a chance to earn an actual racing career with Nissan.

          "description": "Redfall is now available for players worldwide, but unfortunately, I’ve only been playing for a few days and cannot provide a full review yet.\nWriting this Redfall review-in-progress is painful because Arkane Studios is one of my favorite game developers, and its new game is largely disappointing. While the open world is beautifully sculpted with intriguing vistas, it’s weirdly empty, often implying that the harbor town’s vampire usurpers invaded during the offseason. \nAs a whole, Redfall’s gameplay is unbalanced. Several puzzling decisions, like a lack of stealth takedowns or the inability to pause the game in single-player mode, are far from what I’d expect from an Arkane game. Rampant technical issues hinder the brighter moments of the experience, including frequent server crashes, inputs failing to work, NPCs and enemies spawning duplicate versions of themselves, and one very frustrating bug which prevents me from closing the world map and main menu in cooperative play. \nOn a positive note, I like the four launch protagonists, each with unique skills you can upgrade via a straightforward-but-effective skill tree. Also, a handful of weapons are neat, like the heavy-hitting stake launcher or ultra-violet raygun that turns vampires to stone. A few locations, like a deranged scientist’s mansion, a cliffside lighthouse, and a hangar repurposed as a prison quarter, provide enough challenge to incentivize intelligent pathfinding. Unfortunately, most locations and enemy placements feel haphazardly designed – certainly a byproduct of creating two open-world maps. \nHowever, my evaluation may change in the coming days. I’ve completed roughly 50 percent of the game and its first story arc, but I’ve only played for a few days and have more content to see.\n\nWe’re reviewing Redfall on PC. Here are our computer specs: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090, AMD Ryzen 9 5950X 16-Core Processor, 64GB RAM",

Story Kitchen is helmed by names such as Dmitri Johnson (co-producer of the Sonic the Hedgehog films), John Wick creator/writer Derek Kolstad, and APA agent Mike Goldberg. There’s currently no other details about what the series will entail, such as the cast or a premiere date. \n“The most important thing in Vampire Survivors is the story, so it's a dream come true to see what started as a little indie game I made on my weekends come to life as an animated TV show! It’s also great to be partnering up with such experienced and talented people to make the show. I do wonder if they've realised that there isn't a single vampire in Vampire Survivors, though,” says Luca Galante, founder of poncle in a press release.\nIf you're tilting your head wondering how a pixelated arcade game can be translated into a show, it's worth nothing that Vampire Survivors has been brought to life in animated form before. Its two expansions – Legacy of the Moonspell and the recently launched Tides of the Foscari – both featured slick animated trailers, so those could be reference points for how this series may potentially appear. \nVampire Survivors has been on quite a roll since it launched to widespread acclaim last year, scooping up several end-of-year awards and walking away with a couple of BAFTA trophies this year, including winning Best Game.

It will also feature a new chapter called \"The Final Note\" that gives players an alternate perspective on the first game's story. Layers of Fear is being developed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. You can check out the game's performance, as well as its new mechanics and visual enhancements, in the gameplay trailer below: \n\n\nLayers of Fear will support Ray-Tracing, HDR, and 4K resolution. Plus, it uses Lumen global illumination (you might recognize the word \"Lumen\" from Epic Games' Unreal Engine showcase back in 2021), Niagara visual effects \"to create particle effects in real time\" and Action System Controls \"to improve the development process and optimization of all gameplay mechanics,\" according to a press release. \n\"Creating games with Unreal Engine 5 is a great opportunity for the whole team, as it means our game development process can skyrocket in quality,\" Anshar Studios lead programmer Tomasz Bilnicki writes in the press release. \"It has an incredible power when it comes to the implementation of dynamic lighting, shadows, and potentially beautiful worlds for players to explore. We hope that – thanks to the engine – we'll provide players with the unique, immersive, visually stunning, and atmospheric experience in graphical fidelity.\" \nLayers of Fear will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in June. \nFor more, read Game Informer's review of Layers of Fear and then check out our thoughts on its sequel in our Layers of Fear 2 review. \nAre you picking up Layers of Fear this June?

          "description": "Microsoft has released its financial results for Q3 of its 2023 Fiscal Year, which consists of roughly January through March of this year. In it, the company revealed that Xbox hardware revenue is down but its Xbox content and services revenue is slightly up thanks to Xbox Game Pass subscription growth. \nMore specifically, Xbox hardware is down 30% and Xbox content and services is up 3%. Overall, Xbox's gaming revenue is down 4%, though. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that the company set third-quarter records for monthly active users and devices, and that Xbox's gaming subscriptions (see: Game Pass) reached almost $1 billion this quarter. Despite this growth and revenue, though, Microsoft did not release new numbers regarding Game Pass subscription count – the latest count was 25 million in January 2022. \nAs for the dip in hardware revenue, Microsoft says the decline comes from the comparison of this quarter this year to the same quarter in the previous fiscal year, which gained a boost thanks to increased console supply. \nHere are some other numbers from Microsoft's financial results: \nRevenue was $52.9 billion, an increase of 7% (or 10% in constant currency)\nOperating income was $22.4 billion, an increase of 10% (or 15% in constant currency)\nNet income was $18.3 billion, an increase of 9% (or 14% in constant currency)\nXbox hardware revenue is down 30%\nXbox content and services revenue is up 3%\nOverall, Xbox gaming revenue is down 4%\nThese results arrived yesterday, shortly before the Competition and Markets Authority, a U.K. regulatory agency that serves the same purpose as the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., blocked Microsoft's $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard today. You can read more about that here. \nWhat do you think Xbox needs to do to increase Xbox hardware revenue? Let us know in the comments below!",

Microsoft says it remains dedicated to this acquisition and will appeal the CMA's ruling. \n\n\nAs for why the CMA is moving to …",

If this new Season 3 teaser is anything to go off of, Cavill's final season as Geralt looks like a great one to go out on. We get a new look at Geralt and what might be his biggest fear, Yennefer and other mainstay characters, and most interestingly, Ciri, who appears to be running from the Wild Hunt, which were the main antagonist of the last mainline Witcher game, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. \nCheck it out for yourself below in the Season 3 teaser for Netflix's The Witcher: \n\n\nAs you can see, this teaser features plenty of teases for what's in store in Volumes 1 and 2 of the series. And speaking of volumes, this season will be the first split season for The Witcher, taking a page out of other Netflix mainstays like Stranger Things. Volume 1 will drop June 29 and Volume 2 will drop roughly a month later on July 27. \nAre you excited for Season 3? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "Just a few days away from the launch of Horizon Forbidden West's Burning Shores DLC last week, Guerrilla Games has teased more adventures with Aloy. \nThis news comes from a statement released by the studio to announce that studio director and executive producer Angie Smets is leaving Guerrilla to serve as the head of development strategy for PlayStation Studios. It's a move similar to the one the team's former managing director, Hermen Hulst, made in 2019, transitioning from that director position to head of Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios. \n\n\nWithin that statement, Guerrilla teases what could be Horizon 3 or at least, a third game in Aloy's world, as reported by PlayStation Lifestyle. \n\"We have full confidence in our new leadership as they steer Guerrilla towards a bright future, expanding the world of Horizon with Aloy's next adventure and our exciting online project,\" the statement reads. \nAs you can see, Guerrilla isn't trying to hide it – the studio has plans for another adventure with Aloy. And while rumors and speculation point to the \"exciting online project\" being some kind of multiplayer game within the Horizon world, this statement made sure to separate Aloy's next adventure and that online project. \nIn terms of the studio's new makeup, the management team now consists of studio and production director Joel Eschler, studio director and general manager Hella Schmidt, and studio and art director Jan-Bart van Beek. Technical director Michiel van der Lee will \"be focusing on the future technology and strategy for the Decima engine.\" \nThis statement also includes some words from Smets, who leaves Guerrilla after \"an incredible 20 years\" there: \nFor more about Horizon, read Game Informer's Horizon Forbidden West review. \n[Source: PlayStation Lifestyle]\nWhat do you think comes first?

The third (and, so far, final) entry in Rare's beloved platforming series centers on vehicle creation, where players collect and slap together hundreds of parts to assemble their own wacky contraptions to explore. The bevy of possible combinations and emphasis on player choice and creativity was largely unprecedented at the time, paving the way for future games such as the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. However, this direction would divide fans due to how much it strays from the traditional Banjo formula. So where will I land on it?

          "description": "Much like its predecessor, Street Fighter 6 will have an ambitious post-release content plan. While we knew there would be downloadable content, we now have a much better idea about the cadence with which the new characters will arrive.\n\"A big part of Street Fighter's charm is the cast of characters from around the world that appear in each game,\" executive producer Shuhei Matsumoto said during today's Street Fighter 6 Showcase livestream. \"We believe that Street Fighter is where players can take control of unique characters with their own awesome fighting styles. For the players – and for us as well – the appeal of the characters themselves is the most important element of the series. With Street Fighter 6, we're continuing development to deliver new characters to you every year.\"\nDuring Year 1, which kicks off when the game launches, we will receive four new characters to the Street Fighter 6 roster. Rashid, A.K.I., Ed, and Akuma are the characters who will be made available during this first year of content. Rashid, who debuted in the base version of Street Fighter V, arrives in summer 2023. A.K.I., an all-new character, will arrive in fall 2023. Ed, who debuted in Street Fighter IV but was first playable in Street Fighter V, arrives in the early parts of 2024. Akuma, the Great Demon who first appeared in Super Street Fighter II Turbo, joins Street Fighter 6 in spring 2024. These characters will also appear in World Tour, the single-player RPG-inspired story mode, giving players some insight into their backgrounds.\nIf you buy either the Deluxe ot Ultimate Editions, you get the Year 1 characters included in that version. Street Fighter 6 arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on June 2.

          "description": "HeR Interactive’s The Vampire Diaries and Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill are now ready for testing in ScummVM!\nThe Vampire Diaries follows Elena Gilbert, a high school student who discovers vampires are living in her hometown after one of them attacks her younger sister. The game is loosely based on the book series of the same name by author L. J. Smith, which later got adapted into a hit TV series.\nNancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill is the first installment of the long-running Nancy Drew game series, also based on a book series of the same name. In her first adventure, Nancy seeks to uncover the killer of a high school student who seems to have been disliked by all of his classmates.\nYou will need the data files from the games’ original install CDs, and a fresh daily build of ScummVM. Apart from the original release, Secrets Can Kill’s Russian translation is also supported. The ScummVM wiki pages for The Vampire Diaries and Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill contain information on which datafiles are needed. Please, report any problems you encounter in our issue tracker.\n>",

Anyone who has a copy of Backyard Football, Backyard Baseball 2001, and even Backyard Football 2002 (which was originally a LAN-only title) can download the latest daily build* of ScummVM and play online games against real people!\nThis all became possible because the three developers from the Backyard Sports Online fork had joined the team and brought their services with them to the ScummVM. These are LittleToonCat, Jim “jibbodahibbo” Westerkamp and Sam “QuestionMonkey” Kupfer.\nPlease note that Backyard Football and Backyard Baseball 2001 require online accounts for the complete online experience, so you need to register to Backyard Sports Online, which is our fantastic online-play service and a thriving community of fellow Backyard Sports players, they even have a couple of competitive online Baseball and Football leagues, if that's your style, you can find more information in their Discord server! People who already have a Backyard Sports Online account can log in using the latest daily build and play, but if you do not, you can register right here! This is not required to play Backyard Football 2002 online.\nIf you encounter any issues playing online, please let us know via the issue tracker.\nThis fantastic art is done by a fellow BSO community member Peppyrus.\n* only the Windows, macOS, Debian, Raspberry Pi, and Android builds are compatible with network play at the moment. And only the 2.8.x branch of ScummVM has this functionality.\n>",

Most notably, we’ve fixed two kinds of crashes: Road vehicles inside multi-track level crossings no longer crash into the side of trains. The game no longer crashes when a spectator in a network game tries to interact with a town’s local authority. For NewGRF authors using the new engine variant feature introduced in 13.0, we’ve added a callback to select how the engine’s name is displayed in the buy menu. As always, there are plenty of other bugfixes, which you can find in the changelog. Download Changelog Bug tracker",
