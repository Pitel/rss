          "description": "The Samsung Pro Plus is, alongside the Logitech G502 Hero, one of those hardware products that rocks up at literally every single sales event in the calendar. Just an endless cycle of microSD cards, mice, microSD cards, mice. At least it’s a good'un, though - the best Steam Deck-compatible microSD of them all, in fact. Previously, its one weakness was the lack of a truly cavernous 1TB model, but that was amended earlier this year, and now that capacity is getting its first major saving as part of Black Friday 2024.\nRead more",

          "description": "Cyber Knights Colon Flashpoint does not lead with its best foot. This is easier to shrug off while it's still in early access, but I will confess some relief when I read that the Trese Brothers (It's pronounced \"Trese\") nudged their estimated release date back to 2025. It needs a bit longer. But I'm about ready to start recommending it.\nI'm a tad biased by my love for their previous Star Traders Colon Frontiers, an interest in mercenary management, and a wish for more turn-based tactics games that aren't bloody XCOM again. That I have reservations about what CKF hasn't yet nailed down is in part a symptom of high expectations. And because despite carrying over some design ethos from Frontiers, Cyber Knights is a very different kind of game.\nRead more",

Released in 2008, it's part of the fine tradition of post-Gears double-A actioners that basically consist of taking a gruff man, throwing him into a world of grit, gravel and burning oil drums, and handing him a murderous gimmick. Dark Sector's gimmick was the glaive, a pointy boomerang you could use to scoop up objects, solve puzzles, and kill stuff in third-person view.\nRead more",

But even if hadn’t been ecommerced to death, there’d still be a way to get the upgraded ray tracing and DLSS 3 frame gen tools of the RTX 40 series for less cash still: plucky 1080p contender, the RTX 4060, whose deals are still very much available and kicking.\nIn the UK, the best available prices are for the MSI GeForce RTX Ventus 2X Black edition, which is the partner card I happen to own myself – and has become the effective go-to GPU for RPS game performance tests. Over in the US, meanwhile, the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4060 Gaming OC is the most affordable of all; it’s a chunkier design than that of the compact Ventus 2X, though that’s mainly just the tradeoff for having an extra fan. These cards were already on the cheaper end of the RTX 4060 spectrum, and now they’re £30 / $35 off in the sales. Bargain.\nRead more",

Every year, this damned multi-buttoned mouse goes on sale, and every year, I’m powerless to avoid writing about it. Can’t even be bothered to take a different header image photo. It’s partly your fault, you know. You like it too much.\nThis time it’s down from £80 to £26 in the UK (£27 outside the Bezos Empire), which isn’t quite an all-time low, but is pretty close – and a silly-good price for such a capable mouse in any case. Its US discount price of $35 ain’t half bad either, though I notice Amazon US is shouting louder about knocking the newer G502 X down from $80 for $45. That’s mostly a fine mouse as well, though I find its redesigned scroll wheel a bit too much on scratchy side. Of the two, I’d stick with the classic.\nRead more",

          "description": "The genre of 'Action RPG' is supremely annoying to write about, because the term can mean different things to different people, but here’s how I see it: Diablo 4 and similar games, such as Path Of Exile, are 'ARPGs'. Which stands for 'Action RPG'. But Zelda games are 'Action RPGs', which is a totally different genre that you could, if you felt like it, also shorten to 'ARPG'. So, to summarise: ARPGs and ARPGs are two different things, and both are Action RPGs. Got it? Great.\nIt’s because of this kerfuffle that I’m not exactly mad at Diablo boss Rod Fergusson recently suggesting that we just call games that are similar to Diablo 'Diablo-likes'. I just find it very funny that he’s the one saying it, in a bold faced act of admittedly very inconsequential linguistic colonialism that carries the unspoken connotation that something is \"like the game I make, but a bit crap\".\nRead more",

I'm sure for some this is riveting, but for me, it's something I tire of within seconds.\nAnd so it's with a heavy heart I say that Towers Of Aghasba suffers from the same starting gamut of sticks and stones. There's a hint of some interesting ecosystem stuff springing up a bit later, and judging by the trailers, an ability to clamber on massive flying creatures made of what looks like elephant skin and hair.

          "description": "I've gone on record as not being a huge fan of the artstyle choices used in the new Warcraft I & II remasters. It's crisp and readable, sure, but I'm never exactly thrilled to see all the roughness of older sprites completely done away with, especially when I always felt some of that ruggedness was the point. The tendency of remasters to treat every characterful oddity as a blemish is a wider topic than the scope of this article, but one day, Bluepoint will remaster Bloodborne, and the world will feel my pain. \nAnyway. Nowadays, I'd say Blizzard - or, World Of Warcraft, at least - is pretty much synomous with a softer, more colorful approach to fantasy worlds. While I don't pine for a return to the more boobily ridiculous elements of Frank Frazetta's style, I do often wish that some of the more expressive, pained, and physically grounded elements of classic Sword And Sorcery art was a bit more common. I'm no art scholar, and there's undoubtedly a bit of tunnel vision of my part to this assertion, but as far as as pop culture goes: I see the Blizzard version of fantasy more than I see the Frazetta version, and I don't exactly love it. Same goes for the older, punkier, less uniform sci-fi art from things like 2000 AD and Warhammer 40,000. Edwin touched on some of this in his excellent Space Marine piece. \nAnyway, a valued RPS community member on the Discord shared an older bit of art by Blizzard's Chris Metzen, from the original Starcraft manual. I figured a few of you might enjoy seeing these older pieces, considering how much the overall look of their games has changed over the years. \nRead more",

          "description": "System requirements are on the rise, and a glut of recent PC facepunchers has left some of the RPS treehouse wondering if it’s time for a graphics card upgrade. Being a helpful colleague and a handsome friend, I dutifully informed them that the highly capable Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Super is currently getting the Black Friday price cut treatment, with Zotac’s Twin Edge model dropping especially low in both the UK and US. Still, dear readers, if you feel like punishing us for that comment system switch, you could always head over to Amazon and buy up all the stock yourself.\n$590 is a decent deal for a model that’s spent most of the past few months at $610, but us Brits are getting the better bargain here - even if it’s not for the OC version. £500 means a hefty £49 slasheroo, the deepest discount this card has seen yet, and you’ll also get a key for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle to play when it releases on December 9th.\nRead more",

The orthodox interpretation is that \"Rock Paper Shotgun\" is a folksy regional variation on this, with a \"shotgun\" instead of the \"scissors\". But friends, this is patently absurd. Think about it: a game that pits a shotgun against a rock or piece of paper would be incredibly one-sided. It goes against reason!\nThe sad reality is that the origins of our website's title have been deliberately obscured, allowing cold hard fact to slither back into legend. Behind that mockingly nonsensical moniker sleeps an eldritch truth of such gravity it would make Gandalf spill his mead. Friends, the Rock Paper Shotgun is real. The Weapon exists. Or at least, it once did - and will, for I mean to fashion it anew by combing the writing of RPS writers gone by for raw materials.

I recently moved out from a London flat I'd rented for over a decade, for instance, and this has properly done a number on me. Being given my notice transformed the place from a transient pile of cadaverous lino and spasmodic plumbing into something mythical and unnerving – a whole chapter of my life completed and reduced to a piece of masonry in the rearview mirror, a relic I had been living in for years without quite realising.\nA few video game developers have investigated emotions like these by recreating their current and prior homes as virtual environments: places of mingled memory and invention, expressive of both nostalgia and surprise. At this year's Game Developer Conference in San Francisco, I interviewed a couple of teams who are coming at this premise with very different objectives, and somehow, meeting in the middle. One of the games in question is a work of daydreaming fondness, the other of comical anger.

Far from being a premeditated ambush by intelligent AI-controlled soldiers, this is just a result of the game's janky spawns. Those botched encounters are unlike previous games, where roaming bands of factional murderfolk would patrol the radioactive wastes, seemingly according to their own whims. Back in the day, this wandering baddies feature was dubbed \"A-life\" by developers GSC Game World - basically a jargon word for the simulation of enemies that would lead to \"emergent\" moments of violence and conflict. It was promised as a feature in Stalker 2 but many players have noticed it seems to be absent. Over the weekend, GSC insisted the simulation is technically present in the sequel.

Even if it’s you’re first time hearing his name, you’ll be familiar with his fingerprints on some of the setting’s most defining artwork. He’s responsible for that iconic imagine of the emprah - the one the best shows off the dark irony of a such a wretched figure becoming an idol of worship. While the term ‘grimdark’ originates from 40k’s \"in the grim darkness of the far future…\" tagline, grimdark as an aesthetic is one Blanche pioneered. There’s even a style of miniature painting - Blanchitsu - named after him.\nBasically, even games that don’t use the 40k license owe an incredible amount to Blanche’s work. That’s not to mention his influence on the fantasy setting of the Total War: Warhammer series either. His piece Harry The Hammer was the cover for the first edition of Fantasy Battle - recently added to the strategy game as chaos hero Harold Hammerstorm. I could go on, and I might do so in a bit, but here’s the news: Trademark Films are making a documentary on Blanche’s work, starring Napoleon Dynamite actor Jon Heder. It’s called The Grim And The Dark: The Search For John Blanche, and it’s out next Spring. Here’s a trailer:\nRead more",

Speaking at the G-STAR Conference in Busan earlier this month, recently appointed chief executive officer Shams Jorjani confirmed that Arrowhead are looking into such collaborations, giving the example of refitting your dropship to look like one of Halo's Pelicans, or introducing the Zerg from Blizzard's Starcraft as an enemy faction. \nJorjani cautioned listeners, however, that these injections of third-party DNA need to look and feel appropriate to the setting. After all, if you start fecklessly chucking the Zerg, Chaos Space Marines or Fifth Element's, er, flying taxis into Helldivers 2, it might spoil the meticulous coherency of a game in which saluting protects you against lethal falls and some guy called Joel is running the universe. The funny part is that according to Jorjani, Arrowhead once envisaged a system that would get round the problem of inconsistency by essentially making third-party cosmetics, including whole map skins, visible only to players who have them enabled.

          "description": "Long before Hideo Kojima made the first triple-A walking simulator, he was trying to spin sunlight into bullets. The game in question, Boktai: The Sun Is In Your Hand, is a Game Boy Advance title from 2003, in which you play a vampire-slaying gunslinger. The gun you're slinging is a \"solar-powered\" pistol, which you could charge up using a cartridge-mounted photometric sensor by physically standing in sunshine. This was 13 years before the launch of Pokemon Go. Sadly, Boktai's debut didn't result in city parks or rooftops being flooded by crowds of GBA-wielding undead killers. But it was a fun gimmick and the game itself is good enough to carry it - an isometric dungeon-crawler in which you have to find a vamp's coffin and drag it to the surface for purgation.\n Read more",

This upsets me slightly, because I find Rockstar’s constant self-assured bloviating to be quite irritating, even though I’m sure I’ll play their game for a billion hours. What Vivat Slovakia is, then, is a very ambitious homage to the Grand Theft Auto series that isn’t shy about it, right down to the font choices.

It casts you as one of several jellybaby pugilists, fighting for dominance over such locations as Ferris wheels and the tops of speeding vans. All of the characters are 1) seemingly drunk, and 2) subject to real-time physics. Your abilities consist of 1) punching, headbutting or kicking people, perhaps knocking them out for a few seconds, and 2) grabbing people and things and either hoisting them skyward like a wrestler, or hoisting yourself skyward like a toddler climbing onto Mummy's head. The only way of defeating people is to hurl them off-map.\n Read more",

Do you consider its brain-jacking of rando cityfolk for monster-hunting purposes a sad waste of potential? Perhaps you'll prefer RAM: Random Access Mayhem, out now in Steam early access, in which you're a fugitive AI hopping between warlike robot bodies in top-down view.\nYes, the subtitle involves both a colon and a dad joke, but the demo is entertaining - Nuclear Throne meets Ctrl Alt Ego, in short. The one major criticism I have after 20 minutes or so is that the flat pixelart perspective makes walls and walkable surfaces look interchangeable, and this feels more like a question of acclimatisation than a real complaint.\n Read more",

Mouthwashing begins with the same premise, albeit in a sci-fi setting. You're piloting a spaceship with a crew of five, clicking on its various controls to override the safety and turn the ship towards a nearby heap of space rock. You mean to crash.

          "description": "If you've been wandering the mystical lands in Fortnite as part of Chapter 6 content, you might have come across the mysterious Sprites.\n\n\nThese creatures can be found all across the map, but you can increase your chances of finding one if you know where to look. Once found, you'll want to return them to get some nice rewards in exchange.\n\n\nHow to get Sprites in Fortnite Chapter 6\n\n\nThere's no specific location where you can find the Sprites, so you'll have to largely depend on your luck. That said, they've reportedly been found more away from the different points of interest, so it will make sense for you to look further and deeper.\n\n\nOnce you find one, it's very hard to miss these creatures. After you pick one, you can find a new throwable item from them.\n\n\n\nWhite Sprites - creates an upward air-based vortex. \n\n\nBrown Sprites - Gives you a reward\n\n\nBlue Sprites - generates a fountain that heals you.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, make sure to be on the lookout for a Sprite Shrine. These shrines will help you to locate the ones that you are yet to find, and you can also return any that you have for more rewards.\n\n\nHow to return Sprites in Fortnite Chapter 6\n\n\nSprite Shrines are not marked on the mini-map, but it's easy to spot them. Once you come close, the place will have a light glow. If you pick up a Sprite, they will also indicate the location of a nearby shrine. Once you reach the spot, you can submit the Sprite that you picked up to get a Boon in return.\n\n\nThe Boons will depend on the type of Sprite you submit, but all three of them are pretty useful. You'll also get other items like weapons and consumables that can potentially help you to outlast your opponents on the battlefield.\n\n\nYou can find these shrines across every major location on the map, so make sure to be on the lookout for them whenever you've picked up a Sprite. \n\nThe post How to find and return Sprites in Fortnite Chapter 6 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The King of Kaijus, Godzilla, is now present in the colorful realms of Fortnite, and you can unlock it to cause waves of radioactive destruction on your enemies.\n\n\nThe Kaiju is one of many recent additions that have been made to the game, and like previous collaborations, it's part of the battle pass. The latest launch just adds to the long list of special collaborations that Epic Games has made with their battle royale. Let's take a look at how you can obtain this special skin and if it involves any kind of microtransactions.\n\n\nHow to get the Godzilla skin in Fortnite\n\n\nGodzilla is part of the new pass, and to be more specific, it can be unlocked from Season 6, Chapter 1. This season, the pass has been completely revamped, and the format of the rewards has been altered. However, you'll first need to own the Battle Pass, which costs 1,000 V-Bucks to unlock.\n\n\nHaving the pass won't be enough, as you'll need to wait for the correct date in order to unlock the skin. On January 17, you will be able to unlock the King of Monsters, and more rewards that are part of the pass. Additionally, you'll also need to complete the quests in order to play with the skin.\n\n\n\n\nThe quests, as of writing, are unknown. These quests will become available only on January 17, so you'll have to wait for the time being. It will be mandatory for you to complete all these missions if you want to get the Godzilla skin to use in Fortnite.\n\n\nFor the time being, it appears that this skin will be exclusive to the Season Pass. However, Epic has made older skins available in the in-game store that were once exclusive to Season Passes. If that happens in the future, it will be great for those who might not be able to afford the pass at the moment.\n\nThe post How to find Godzilla in Fortnite appeared first on Destructoid.",

GSC Game World was quick not just to address the issues, but to come up with a patch. And what a patch that was, one single piece of software that dared to fix over 650 serious stability issues.\n\n\nThough the original patch seems to have solved what it had set out to, there were some more issues left unaddressed, which GSC Game World is now attempting to fix with this new patch. The smaller but non-negligible list of fixes includes:\n\n\n\nFixed an issue when the second wave  would not spawn during the “On the Edge” mission, blocking further progression.\n\n\nFixed the issue when  could be found dead during the “A Minor Incident” mission, blocking further progression.\n\n\nThe fixed issue was a player could get stuck after installing the fuse in the Wild Island area if they got the  first during the “Just Like the Good Old Days” mission, blocking further progression.\n\n\nThe fixed issue was when a player could not successfully complete the “All That is Left” mission while exploring the Chemical Plant region.\n\n\nFixed issue when quest enemies could spawn in unreachable areas for a player during the “Down Below” mission, blocking further progression.\n\n\nFixed an issue when  could be missing during the “Visions of Truth” mission.\n\n\nA few more EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION errors are fixed.\n\n\n\nGSC Game World has been doing a great job of dealing with these issues, and a large part of that is thanks to great cooperation with players, whom the team thanks and asks to keep on reporting any future issues here.\n\n\nYou can now enjoy a much more stable version of Stalker 2: Heart Of Chornobyl on PC and Xbox Series X|S.\n\nThe post Stalker 2 drops surprise extra patch appeared first on Destructoid.",

If you're looking for a new look, here is how and where you can find the Barber in the game.\n\n\nWhere to find the Barber in Towers of Aghasba\n\n\nDespite not being a particularly important mechanic in Towers of Aghasba, you can change your hairstyle by speaking with the Barber in Midhaven. However, you won't have access to him until a few hours into the game since he is in Midhaven itself.\n\n\nTo unlock the Barber, you first need to gain access to Midhaven by repairing the Lutoro Bridge. This is actually the main story, so if you just follow that quest line, you'll reach this point without any problem.  \n\n\nImage by Destructoid\n\n\nWhen you've reached Midhaven, you'll notice that it is all in ruin and that there is no Barber present. To actually unlock him, you need to upgrade Midhaven to Tier 1 so that there is actually room for him to set up shop. You'll need mostly commonly found materials to do so, but one of the materials Gold Dust, isn't as obvious to find. Gold Dust can be found by harvesting the debris around Midhaven.\n\n\nOnce you've upgraded Midhaven to Tier 1, you can find the Barber at his stall to the right of the Midhaven Village Board.

There's a plot twist, however, and that's about how Motiram looks like it's taking too much influence from other games as well.\n\n\nThough the presentation isn't in English, it features various gameplay elements that appear to be straight out of other games. For one, it's impossible to ignore the robot hovering over us, which is highly reminiscent of our robot companion, Ghost, from the Destiny series. \n\n\n\nImage via MMOs.com\n\n\nScreenshot via Destructoid\n\n\n\nPerhaps most interestingly, though, is how the game looks a lot like Horizon, but actually seems to play like Valheim. Everything, from the hunting, gathering, and building - even down to the funny droplets that rain down from the character's body when he's over-encumbered in Valheim — makes an appearance in Motiram.\n\n\nStill, it's undeniable that if you manage to look past everything, Motiram looks functional. Most cobbled-together games tend to break at the seams, but Motiram looks like it plays without any issues, so that's something.\n\nThe post Light of Motiram releases 16-minute gameplay trailer, proves it isn’t only ripping off Horizon appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "A recent BBC investigation has concluded that the most popular mobile games in the UK ignore rules pertaining to the disclosure of loot box usage in video games.\n\n\nOut of the 45 most popular loot box-containing video games currently being sold in the UK, only two advertise the presence of loot box shenanigans as they should under the current regulations.\n\n\nThe BBC checked the adverts for the top 45 highest grossing games on Google's Play Store, which along with Apple's App Store are where the vast majority of people access mobile games.\n\n\nOf those 45, 26 were labelled as including loot boxes — 22 of which were being actively advertised at the same time.\n\n\nHowever, only two of those titles spelt out the presence of the loot boxes in their ads.\n\n\nMonopoly GO, the most successful game on Google's Play store — with over 50 million downloads and over 3 billion dollars in transactions — does not correctly advertise its usage of loot boxes.\n\n\nLoot boxes have been a huge problem in the world of non-mobile games for a while, but gamers grew so tired of them that even big companies have been rethinking the practice. Spending real money or even just playing incessantly to open a box that may or may not contain an extra item players want is an extra-awful game of carrot-on-a-stick, one that has proven harmful both to the gaming industry and the livelihood of players.\n\n\nIn the mobile scene, however, things are different, and games following highly addictive and costly loot box mechanics have been thriving for a while. The less immersive and more quick reward-oriented nature of mobile games proves fertile ground for this highly addictive and dangerous practice to fester, and festered it sure has.\n\n\nThe BBC has asked Hasbro to comment on the issue, but has yet to receive a reply.\n\n\n\nThe post The most successful mobile games ignore loot box laws, study shows appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Last month, the company behind music streaming app Musi sued Apple for breach of contract, following the removal of its app from the App Store. Musi hoped for a swift reinstatement through a preliminary injunction, but Apple believes the court should deny the request. The tech giant argues that the delisting is allowed under its developer contract, stressing that the removal was not an impulsive decision. \nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

          "description": "Castle Master, the haunting conclusion to the Freescape engine saga, is now ready for public testing!\nPrepare yourself for a perilous adventure as you lower the drawbridge to enter the Castle Master’s domain. Released in 1990 by Incentive Software, Castle Master became popular for its technical innovation and challenging gameplay. The game inspired countless 3D adventure titles, and the Freescape engine itself marked a technological milestone, enabling groundbreaking object interaction and spatial puzzles.\nNotably, Castle Master was one of the first games to let you choose to play as either a prince or a princess, offering a different experience depending on your choice.\nYour mission: rescue your twin, imprisoned within the eerie depths of Castle Eternity by the evil Magister. This sprawling, foreboding castle is filled with traps, monsters, and puzzles blocking your path. Gather items, unlock doors, and solve complex riddles as you navigate the labyrinthine halls and confront the dark forces within.\nThis modern reimplementation showcases enhanced graphics using OpenGL, with initial support for the DOS and ZX Spectrum releases. If you’re eager to embark on this dark journey, a playable demo is available to test your tenacity.\nTo participate in the testing, ensure you have a daily development build. We encourage all players to submit feedback and bug reports through our issue tracker.\nWill you brave the creepy corridors of Castle Eternity and free your sibling, or will you fall victim to the Magister’s curse and join his army of enslaved spirits? The adventure awaits!\n>",

          "description": "After seven months of intense work, we are ready to announce support for a few games based on qdEngine, developed by K-D Labs.\nThe work is based on the original sources published now under GPL, although the work started a bit earlier than that. The engine supports 14 games, five of which we are announcing support for. Most of these games were released in Russian; however, there were Lithuanian, Czech, and Polish releases. The support is announced for:\nWait for it! Issue 3. Song for a Hare, (Russian: Ну, погоди! Выпуск 3. Песня для зайца, Lithuanian: Na, palauk! Zuikio dainos, Czech: Jen počkej a Píseň pro zajíce)\nMask Show (Russian: Маски-шоу)\nMarvellous Mice Adventures: Meeting Sea Rat (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. Визит Морской крысы, Czech: Příběhy myší rodinky I, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Na Spotkanie Cioci Myszy)\nThe Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik (Russian: Похождения бравого солдата Швейка)\nMarvellous Mice Adventures: Sea Rat's Birthday, (Russian: Три маленькие белые мышки. День рождения морской крысы, Polish: Były Sobie Myszki Trzy: Urodzinowe Śledztwo)\nOther games do work; however, we haven’t playtested them. You may find more information on our Wiki. Also, we are looking for the Lithuanian version of Little Longnose and Polish releases of Little Mice games and Wait for it! game. If you happen to have a copy, please contact sev.\nWe continue the active development so that support for other games will follow shortly. The primary constraint is playtesting.\nTo run these games, you need the latest daily build of ScummVM. If you encounter any hiccups during your quests, please file them on our issue tracker.\n>",

Debutující scenárista a režisér Vojtěch Strakatý nám přináší drama děvčete, které netuší, co si počít.\n\n\nExistuje vícero českých filmů, které surfují na oblíbené vlně \"zakažte exekutory, zrušte dluhy, je to nelidské!\" (například Tancuj Matyldo). After Party takovým filmem není. Exekutoři se v něm chovají korektně a slušně a vinu na situaci celé rodiny nese naprosto jednoznačně otec, který neopatrně investoval, i když nevíme jak.
