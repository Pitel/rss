Alongside Steam on the PC side of the fence, where Braid also did gangbusters on launch in 2009, XBLA helped to democratise game publishing, and the two storefronts enabled Braid – and Blow – to rocket to fame.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

However, Experiment 101’s debut title is finally here, but it maybe should have been held back for the Switch's successor.\nBiomutant takes place in a post-apocalyptic open world, where the Tree-of-Life, a gigantic natural wonder that brings life to the whole world, is slowly being destroyed by five creatures gnawing away at its roots. You begin the game by creating your mutant character who, during the adventure, can choose to save the Tree-of-Life from these creatures and let the tree heal or let the world fall to ruin. After the intro tutorial, you can visit a variety of tribes scattered throughout the corners of the world, side with them, and complete quests that meet their wishes for the world. Some want it to fall to the plague and others are united in trying to save the Tree-of-Life.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

This is the first time the studio has revisited a world, its characters, and their stories, and as a result, is its very first direct sequel.

Hades is a masterclass in narrative design, addictive gameplay, rewarding progression, beautiful art, etc. It's excellent across the board. However — this will shock you — Hades II also happens to be brilliant, and it's not even finished yet!\nAfter 20 hours of playing through the Early Access version, available via Steam and the Epic Games Store, we can tell Supergiant already has another hit on its hands. The studio can't currently reveal what consoles it will be released on just yet — Switch Successor, maybe? We sure as hell hope so — but we couldn't wait that long.

Helldivers 2, meanwhile, is a game in which people are as expendable as bullets, and the storytelling is deliberately brittle because it consists largely of clownish propaganda.

          "description": "When I asked Tango Gameworks creative director John Johanas whom he'd give Hi-Fi Rush's Best Audio trophy away to at this year's GDC Awards, he said he'd split it between the game's audio team and \"the person who taught me everything I know\" - Shinji Mikami, Tango's founder and one of the erstwhile Capcom and Platinum big brains behind Resident Evil, Vanquish and much more besides. I confess, I found this response annoying - partly because I was hoping Johanas would bring up some obscure indie composer I could then namecheck at parties, and partly, because I have spent years waiting for Tango to escape Mikami's shadow after essentially announcing themselves as a Mikami fan project back in 2010. \r\n\n \nRead more",

As in ecologies at large, the most abundant and widespread are probably the bugs, beginning with the moth that flew into that Harvard Mark II in 1947 and ending with the teeming contents of the average free-to-play changelog. A little further up the food chain we find \"worms\", like the Creeper that once invaded the ARPANET, and \"gophers\", a directory/client system written in 1991 for the University of Minnesota. There are computer animals spawned by branding - foxes of fire and twittering birds and the anonymous beasts that haunt the margins of Google documents. There are computer animals that are implied by the verbs we use in computing - take \"browser\", derived from the old French word for nibbling at buds and sprouts, which suggests that all modern internet searches are innately herbivorous. \r\n\n \nRead more",

He was way more online when he was younger, and is the one who got me into the games of Lucasfilm, Troika and Blizzard, but these days he plays the games he likes a lot and does not read specialist websites that tell him why he shouldn't like them. He used to play loads of League Of Legends, but the game he was most into more recently was Hades. This is because he studied Classics.\nI won't tell you how many years its been since he was at university, but for many years - and still sort of now, to be honest - \"liking Apollo\" was a key part of his personality.

The employee, \"Spitz\", was let go following the fiasco in which Sony told PC players they would need to link their Steam and PlayStation Network accounts to continue playing the shooter. Sony and Arrowhead changed their mind about that after player backlash in the form of 100,000+ negative reviews on Steam. The kicker? Community manager \"Spitz\" was low-key encouraging players to continue the review bombing. This doesn't seem to have gone down well internally.\nRead more",

First, why get invested in another asymmetrical multiplayer game from a studio that has a bit of a history with limited shelf lives?

Unfortunately, in its attempt to eat Escape from Tarkov’s lunch – a timely one, given that game’s self-inflicted DLC misery – it’s currently choking on the wishbone of some truly dire performance issues. Even players with tip-top graphics cards are seeing heavy stuttering while out in the field, and none of the updates released thus far, including today’s Hotfix #3, have done much to soothe it.\nSaid hotfix does include some fixes for other widespread problems, including a second attempt at preventing players from becoming headless when rejoining a server (an amusing though resilient glitch, given a previous hotfix had also tried to nix it). But having played a bit of this third patch on a usually reliable RTX 4060, there’s clearly an awful lot of work left to do before Gray Zone Warfare performs acceptably.\nRead more",

Honestly, it fits the dinky PC so well you’d have thought Supergiant had decided to make this roguelike sequel a Steam Deck game that just happened to run on desktops by accident.\nHades the first was much the same, taking to the Deck like Hercules to Augean shit, but Hades 2 barely even gives away that fact that it’s unfinished. It doesn’t crash, stutter, or hang, and there’s no point in talking about settings when it runs at a practically perfect 60fps on max quality. Make that 90fps on the Steam Deck OLED, too. It’s just a fabulous game for handhelds, even in its earliest of early access days.\nRead more",

          "description": "I didn't have a Game Boy Camera as a lad, partly because I couldn't afford one, and partly because my \"friends\" used to troll me (\"bullying\", I think we called it back then) about my Game Boy. Amongst other things, they'd reach over and flick the power off while I was playing The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening. I didn't finish that game for 15 years. I'd flown the family nest before I braved the Eagle's Tower. Can you imagine what my friends would have done if I'd owned a Game Boy Camera? Probably, they'd have taken photos of... bottoms with it, and such. \nI'm aware I'm not making a great case for being a graduate of the School of Hard Knocks. The point is: I didn't have a Game Boy Camera then, so I'm delighted that the Game Boy Camera has caught on among a later generation of indie PC developers - prominent among them artist and educator Catharine Graffam, whose GB Camera Gallery: Mystery Show you can play for free in a browser.\n Read more",

Microsoft si před deseti lety koupil mobilní divizi finské Nokie, za nemalého přispění CEO Nokie Stephena Elopa, předtím vysoce postaveného manažera Microsoftu. Softwarový gigant, kterému krutě ujížděl vlak na poli mobilních platforem si koupil telefonního giganta, kterému také krutě ujížděl vlak. Nokia skončila se Symbianem a přešla na nově vznikající systém Windows Phone. Výsledek se dostavil o 4 roky později, kdy Microsoft definitivně vydáním posledního telefonu s Windows Phone současně celou akvizici za 7 miliard dolarů odepsal a začal se soustředit na jiné cesty jak vydělávat v mobilním světě.",

The May 13 update has fixed this issue and, in line with player feedback since the Thrills and Frills update launched, a few more tweaks.\n\n\nOf course, the most important update from this patch is that buying the 3D glasses before Oswald prompts you to make the purchase longer prevents the progression of Oswald’s Many Dimensions. That's not it for Oswald-related fixes, either, as many players were having issues with another request from Oswald at a previous stage of the same quest. \n\n\nWhen asked to don a pair of white pants, players realized they didn’t actually own any, and Scrooge wasn’t selling any, either. This left them unable to progress until Scrooge coughed up the goods. However, this update also changed the requirement to “light colored pants”, widening the scope of choices for players. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nDaisy’s Boutique also receives a few tweaks and some fine-tuning, including the addition of a placement grid in the area of the shop that is used to participate in her challenges while it’s being edited. You also no longer have to wait 24 hours between cancelling a challenge and picking up a new one. \n\n\nPerhaps the most notable update in terms of the Boutique, though, is the fact that tips have been added during the “You Have Mail!” quest - meaning that players will no longer be left confused about what they have to do. \n\n\nOther notable fixes included with today’s update:\n\n\n\nFixed issues, including “A Day at Disney” duties not appearing and the Premium Shop appearing empty\n\n\nDoor frames and wall items no longer appear when the camera is moved behind a wall\n\n\nDreamlight Fruit can now be harvested during Valley Visits\n\n\nThe main loading screen now displays the proper “Thrills and Frills” artwork\n\n\nThe post Disney Dreamlight Valley update fixes Oswald’s 3D glasses and Scrooge’s stingy pants offerings appeared first on Destructoid.",

Here's everything we know about the Bloodlust Aura in Sol's RNG including the chance to get it and how to increase you overall chances of getting it.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nSol's RNG Era 7 Bloodlust Aura\n\n\nYou'll need to be extremely lucky to get the new Bloodlust Aura in Sol's RNG, as the default chance of rolling it is 1 in 300,000,000. No, that's not a typo. The celestial black and red Aura is without a doubt the coolest in Sol's RNG, so you'll definitely want to try your luck at acquiring it. Even though you can get this aura by any means of rolling, even in the default biome and with Heavenly, there is actually some tips to help improve your chance of getting Bloodlust Aura in Sol's RNG. Here's what you should do:\n\n\n\nRoll inside the new Hell Biome\n\n\nEquip the new Vulkanic Device (don't need to be in Hell Biome for this)\n\nSimulates 100% of Hell's Heats\n\n\nIncreases luck by 290%\n\n\nDecreases roll cooldown by 35%\n\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in VIP, get the Quick Roll and VIP for faster rolls and better rewards.\n\n\n\nHow to get Bloodlust Era in Sol's RNG\n\n\nAssuming you're going to go to the new Hell Biome, you have a 1/6,666 chance of it spawning without using the new Biome Randomizer or Manipulator items. The biome itself lasts about 11 minutes and is easy to notice due all of the flora and fauna being bright red, waterfalls flowing lava, and the overall red hell-themed environment.\n\n\nWhen here, the chance for Bloodlust Aura instantly comes down to 1/50,000,000, which while not great, is 6x better than 1/300,000,000 if you're in the default biome. Throw on a Vulkanic Device to increase your luck by 290% and the chance is even greater.\n\n\nKeep rolling in the Hell Biome with your Vulkanic  Device to get even quicker rolls, and you will get the Bloodlust Aura in no time.\n\nThe post How to get Bloodlust Aura in Sol’s RNG appeared first on Destructoid.",

Here's how to find and play Fortnite GeoGuessr.\n\n\nWhat is Fortnite GeoGuessr?\n\n\nFortnite GeoGuessr is a game much like regular GeoGuessr that, rather than having you guess real-world locations, has you pick where you are on the Fortnite map. You can choose between the game's full history, all of a chapter, or a specific season. \n\n\nOnce you pick your map and create a single-player or multiplayer game, your view will land in a random spot in the world. Using context clues, previous game knowledge, and map hints, you'll look around the world before going to your Fortnite GeoGuessr minimap and choosing a location. Like GeoGuessr, you'll score more points the closer you are to the correct location, with the maximum score being 25,000 points for a standard five-round game.\n\n\nFortnite GeoGuessr also features a leaderboard for each map, allowing you to compete with other players to see who can get the most points the fastest. In other words, if you're knowledgeable enough about your chosen Fortnite chapter or season to consistently get 25,000 points each time, you can compete for the top spot by improving your speed. \n\n\nCurrently, Fortnite GeoGuessr only supports up to Chapter 4, Season 1, meaning you won't find any Chapter 5 content for now. While this might change in the future, you'll have to stick to older map versions for now. \n\nThe post How to play Fortnite GeoGuessr appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "ImperialHal reached the mountaintop with TSM in 2023, securing an Apex Legends Global Series Championship title. However, a historic five-year run with the organization is officially ending. \n\n\nIn the Year 4 ALGS regular season split 1, TSM finished 13th place, arguably lower than most fans expected. Then, at the Year 4 Split 1Playoffs LAN event that ended on May 5, TSM finished in 17th, marking another disappointing performance. Those results played a significant role in ImperialHal deciding to make a change. \n\n\n\"To put it as bluntly as possible, it had nothing to do with money, it had nothing to do with contracts, it had nothing to do with TSM management, ImperialHal said. \"It felt like there was a change needed.\" \n\n\n\n\n\nAs for what's next, ImperialHal confirmed that he will be teaming up with Zer0 and Genburten on Dark Zero in place of eSikezz, who will now be a free agent. It was also revealed that Zer0 will be the in-game leader for the new squad. After a first-place finish in the regular season and placing second at the Year 4 Split 1Playoffs, Dark Zero will be one of the favorites in Split 2, which is scheduled to start on June 1. \n\n\n\"I understand that people will be like it's one bad LAN there's no reason to be so sporadic and make a huge move,\" ImperialHal added. \"But I feel like a majority of my decisions when it came to my career like who to pick up and who to join has been pretty spot on ever since the beginning because all I want to do is win.\" \n\n\nImperial leaves behind a legacy that will be hard to top at TSM. With the organization, the decorated pro built up an impressive trophy cabinet, including wins at the 2019 X Games and 2019 Preseason Invitational and multiple playoff triumphs. TSM has yet to confirm who will be stepping in for ImperialHal to flank alongside Reps and Verhulst.\n\nThe post ImperialHal leaves TSM, marking the end of an era in Apex Legends appeared first on Destructoid.",

During this period, you can look forward to the following exciting content:\n\n\n\n1 \"flirtatious\" Expansion pack\n\n\n2 Destination kits\n\n\n2 Free \"stylish\" updates\n\n\n\nWith its romance theme, many Simmers believe that the Sims 4 Season of Love is a nostalgic nod to the franchise's original Hot Date expansion pack. This groundbreaking addition introduced the concept of location visits, a feature that has evolved significantly in the fourth installment. The latest news has sparked speculation among fans, with some already dubbing the next EP as Sims 4 Hot Date 2. Personally, I'm crossing my fingers for the return of the heart-shaped hot tub.\n\n\nBased on the artwork of Season of Love, the kits will likely provide more pool outdoor furniture and French cafe-inspired items. New cosmetics are also set to arrive with the two free updates. \n\n\n\n\nAlthough the upcoming content hasn't been explicitly clear, fans still hope to see hotels added to the game, which would be perfect for romantic getaways. Online dating could be another feature added, but we'll have to see what happens in the coming months. No matter what, Sims 4 Season of Love will undoubtedly change up its classic romance system, bringing in possible new interactions and alluring build items. \n\nThe post Sims 4 Season of Love roadmap: Romantic-themed Expansion pack, two destination kits, and more appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Crow Country's various wings (heh) and storerooms are often locked behind keyholes of varying value: bronze, silver, and gold. The mid-game silver key has a few requirements that are sure to spoil things if you aren't far enough along, so read on with caution.\n\n\nTo get the silver key in Crow Country, you're going to need three core items that can be found in the midsection of the game:\n\n\n\nThe Crank, accessed from the vault beyond the Crypt (code 1872)\n\n\nThe Ruby, found in Haunted Manor demon painting (this requires the crank to access via the clocks)\n\n\nThe Chain, accessed from the Swan Boats puzzle, which requires the ruby to be inserted into the swan head to gain control of the ride controls\n\n\n\nWith these components in hand, head to the Dig Site, which can be accessed by using the bronze key on the mailbox outside the entrance. Inside, grab the gasoline tank from the corner of the room and use it to fill the tank behind the torch. Use the crank to fill the hole with water, then use the crane by attaching the chain to its gears. This will lift a resin-coated mask to the surface, which can be freed by using the torch. \n\n\nMask in hand, head to the Witch Wood and open the entrance by slotting it into the right indentation. Inside, you'll find a labyrinth which can be completed by whacking totems to lower barriers. This isn't too difficult, and there's no limit on how many times you can hit each. Be sure to watch your head for falling traps, though. \n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid.\n\n\nOnce you're in the middle, grab the key from the pond and get ready for a fight. The barriers will all lower, but enemies will begin to enter the maze.

Some resources only show up in specific places, while others show up in batches of 1-2 a run while you need a dozen. It gets tough, but those rewards are so, so worth it. Here's how to get Marble in Hades 2.\n\n\nWhere to get Marble in Hades 2\n\n\nImage via Destructoid.\n\n\nMarble is found exclusively in Tartarus, the fourth zone of the main Hades 2 run. Bring the pickaxe with you and progress to the region, then work through it until you spot several Marble busts of Chronos. Break these fully to get three Marble each. Since these show up once or twice in Tartarus each run, you should be able to snag 3-6 Marble quite easily. It helps that most recipes don't require much.\n\n\nIf you've progressed far enough and gotten the Incantation, it's possible to get more Marble by upgrading your pickaxe. This can be done within the central equipment area, in the menu where you select your weapon and tool. It'll cost a pretty penny, but those extra resources can be more than worth it.\n\n\nWhat is Marble used for?\n\n\nMarble is used in a variety of important Incantations across Hades 2. The most useful by far is the one mentioned above regarding upgrading your tools. \n\n\nHowever, you can also unlock a fountain in Tartarus to help keep you going, alongside upgrading certain Arcana cards. This all means you'll need a ton of Marble, though since completing runs requires you to pass through Tartarus, it isn't as bad as it sounds.\n\nThe post How to get Marble in Hades 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "While the regular eight mod slots of your frame in Warframe are important, you shouldn't ignore that Aura slot. Its benefits are more passive than the regular mods, but these benefits can be massive. \n\n\nTake the Growing Power Aura mod for example, which increases Ability Strength when applying Status Effects to enemies. One such mod is great in some builds, though getting it is tough. Here's how to get the Corrosive Projection mod in Warframe.\n\n\nWhere to get the Corrosive Projection mod in Warframe\n\n\nImage via Destructoid.\n\n\nThe Corrosive Projection mod is exclusively available as part of the rotating Nightwave Cred Offerings for 20 Creds. These Offerings rotate every week on Sunday at 8 PM ET, so you'll need to return each week until Corrosive Projection appears. If you don't have any Creds, you need to complete levels of the Nightwave by handling specific challenges and acquiring XP. Certain levels on the reward track reward Nightwave Creds. Once you have enough and Corrosive Projection is an available mod, snag it before it disappears!\n\n\nPlenty of other Aura mods are also available as part of the rotating Cred Offerings. For 20 Creds each, you can acquire  Energy Siphon, Physique, and Shield Disruption. All three are worth picking up, with other Aura mods decent albeit very situational.\n\n\nIs the Corrosive Projection mod worth using?\n\n\nThe Corrosive Projection mod, at max rank, reduces enemy armor by 18%. Naturally, this means you'll output more damage. This isn't a big damage increase on its own, but in an armor-stripping build, can be invaluable. For example, I run my Wisp with Pillage as her ult, already armor-stripping enemies a ton. Combined with Molt Augmented to get more Ability Strength on kill, alongside Corrosive Projection, I can remove 100% of enemy armor and make it impossible for them to survive. If this sounds like the type of build for you, give it a whirl.\n\nThe post How to get the Corrosive Projection mod in Warframe appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "While most games would list a handful of resources early that you'll need throughout the game, Hades 2 is a different beast. You'll need plenty of early resources for various recipes, but new ones are introduced as late as after your first victory. These factor into late-game upgrades and can be utterly invaluable. One such resource is tough to get but plays into select upgrades for your arsenal. Here's how to get Dark in Hades 2.\n\n\nWhere to find Dark in Hades 2\n\n\nDark is acquired from the Chaos realm, which is accessed through the occasional Chaos portal found in a run. These require some health to be sacrificed but can make for a good challenge/reward boon. Once you've spoken to Chaos enough and progressed the story with them, they will eventually mention Dark and reward you with one for free. From there, you'll sometimes find Dark when visiting the Chaos realm and be able to pick it up. You don't need a specific tool for it.\n\n\nWhile you're in the realm of Chaos, you can score both Plasma and Origin Seeds. The latter is especially important since it allows you to grow Thalamus, a resource used in a specific Incantation to reach the surface. If you haven't gotten to the surface yet, it's highly suggested you bring a shovel to try and get some seeds while grinding for Dark.\n\n\nWhat is Dark used for?\n\n\nImage via Destructoid.\n\n\nAs far as we can tell, there are two specific uses for Dark. The main use is for late-game Grasp upgrades, which allow you to take more Arcana cards with you. However, certain weapon Aspects such as the Aspect of Thanatos seem to require Dark as well. You should visit Chaos as often as possible to get an early surplus of Dark, saving you time later.\n\nThe post How to get Dark in Hades 2 appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "While you can mostly farm resources passively in Warframe, some resources are better acquired through target farming them. Certain areas are either much better for specific resources or are the only way to acquire them, so it can help a ton to know where to look. One of these resources can be somewhat rare and is used in many blueprints. Here's how to farm Neural Sensors in Warframe.\n\n\nWhere to get Neural Sensors in Warframe\n\n\nThere are two ways you can go about farming Neural Sensors. You can either farm the Alad V Assassination mission on Themisto, Jupiter, or you can farm a specific Survival or Defense mission and hope enemies drop them. The Alad V Assassination mission is typically the more consistent one, giving Neural Sensors every 1-2 runs of the mission. It's also quite fast once you know how to deal with Alad V. However, missions like Elara and Cameria on Jupiter could give more, provided you're willing to put in the time.\n\n\nOnce you get a drop of Neural Sensors, you should get 1-2 no matter the enemy. If you're running a Resource Booster, this can be upped to 2-4 per drop. A Resource Drop Chance Booster can also help, but it won't affect the drop rate of Neural Sensors when fighting Alad V.\n\n\nWhat are Neural Sensors used for?\n\n\nNeural Sensors are used in numerous blueprints, including parts for numerous frames, several weapons, and a handful of cosmetics. The most common use, however, is in Forma. Since you need a lot of these to get the most out of your frame and weapon builds, you'll naturally need a ton of Neural Sensors. Even excluding the need to repeat the process, building one of everything that needs Neural Sensors requires 241. That's a lot of grinding. \n\nThe post How to farm Neural Sensors in Warframe appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "The Tonfa melee weapon hasn't quite become popular yet, but it's emerged in Asian lobbies and might spread like wildfire soon. \n\n\nThe Tonfa is a melee weapon first introduced to Modern Warfare 2 in Season 4. As part of the carry forward program, the weapon came over to MW3, but most melee weapons go unnoticed in Warzone, as SMGs and shotguns are usually better for short-range engagements. However, a player claimed on Reddit that there had been a surge of Tonfa users in Asian lobbies since the Season 3 Reloaded update went live on May 1.\n\n\nImage via Activision\n\n\nOne user pointed out that the automatic tactical sprint bug helped increase popularity because players don't need to reload while using a melee weapon. As a result, players could still have the automatic tactical sprint setting on without worrying about their weapons being unable to reload. Raven Software fixed the bug, but there are also other advantages worth noting. \n\n\nAccording to that same player, the Tonfa can kill faster than any other weapon within a three-meter range, which gets even deadlier with a smoke grenade. If a player tries to fire their weapon through a smoke grenade, they lose aim assist, making it harder to hit an enemy. But with a Tonfa equipped, users can blindly swing around and get a kill. To add insult to injury, players can also equip the Combat Scout perk so the enemy will be highlighted in orange after taking damage, so it would be even easier to get a kill with a Tonfa. \n\n\nAnd for the cherry on top, a riot shield and Tonfa combination provides cover while they get closer to finish the kill off with the melee weapon. It's unclear if this trend will extend outside these anecdotal matches, but lobbies are in trouble if players catch wind of how powerful the weapon can be. \n\nThe post Tonfas have strong potential to take over Warzone appeared first on Destructoid.",

The reveal was purely cinematic, however, but today’s new trailer shows off his gameplay.\nThe video not only gives fans a sample of actor Mark Hamill’s new voice lines, but also reveals that Joker has an alternate costume modeled after The Batman Who Laughs. The video also shows what appears to be unique dialogue interactions between Joker and his long-time sidekick, Harley Quinn. \n\n\nMultiVersus has other new characters joining the fray that will be revealed over time. Following a lengthy hiatus since its open beta concluded last year, the game will return in an improved form on May 28.",

Joining Ineson is a female Silver Surfer played by Julia Garner (Ozark).\n\n\nPaul Walter Hauser (Cobra Kai) and John Malkovich (Being John Malkovich) will also appear in The Fantastic Four, although their roles are currently undisclosed. \nIf you've played FFXVI, you already know Ineson has an incredible voice, certainly perfect for the role of a massive galactic entity that devours planets; we can't wait to see what he does as Galactus when The Fantastic Four hits theaters on July 25, 2025. \nFor more, read Game Informer's Final Fantasy XVI review, and then read Game Informer's exclusive interview with Final Fantasy XVI producer Naoki Yoshida about lessons learned, Clive's reception, loose ends, and more.

While each of the four studios affected, which also included Mighty Doom developer Alpha Dog Games and Bethesda support studio Roundhouse Games, released a statement about the closures, Xbox remained silent. \nHowever, four days later, Bloomberg's Dina Bass interviewed Xbox president Sarah Bond and asked her about the Bethesda closures, to which Bond cited a desire to keep the Xbox business healthy in the long term, even through hard transition periods. \n\n\nHere's what Bond said: \nBass then asked Bond specifically about the closure of Tango Gameworks after Hi-Fi Rush, which by Xbox's own admitted metrics, was a big success. Bond's answer here was less straightforward – you can read it below in full: \nWhile it's great that Bond addressed these closures at Xbox, it still lacks the clarity you'd expect from one of the biggest companies in the games industry. Neither Microsoft nor Xbox, including Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer, has yet to address the layoffs and closures in an official capacity beyond this.\nFor more, read about how Redfall was reportedly set to receive a big offline play update this month before Xbox shut down Arkane Austin, and then read about how Xbox is reportedly considering bringing Senua's Saga: Hellblade II to PlayStation 5. After that, check out this story about how more job cuts at Xbox are reportedly on the way, and then read about how the company is debating putting Call of Duty on Xbox Game Pass alongside a price hike. \nWhat do you think of Bond's answers?

Continuing the Scarlet & Violet series is Twilight Masquerade, a set that focuses on the Teal Mask DLC of the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet video games. Because of that, players can expect locations, characters, and Pokémon from Kitakami, the folklore-rich area from the first part of the Hidden Treasure of Area Zero storyline.\nAs such, new Pokémon like Bloodmoon Ursaluna, Fezandipiti, Okidogi, Munkidori, and Sinistcha are all featured in Twilight Masquerade. However, the most common new Pokémon I encountered during my opening of several booster packs sent over by The Pokémon Company was Ogerpon; I pulled several different versions of the grass-type Legendary Pokémon from The Teal Mask. \nPokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet – Twilight Masquerade adds 226 cards, including 14 new Pokémon ex cards, more than 30 Trainer cards, and dozens of special-illustration cards. I'll always love Gen I the most, so I was happy to add new cards featuring favorites like Alakazam, Zapdos, Ninetales, and Eevee, but my absolute favorites are the special illustration versions of Applin, Sunflora, and Infernape. I also adore the Hearthflame Mask Ogerpon ex card that I was lucky enough to grab.\nYou can check out my favorite cards I pulled from booster packs below.\n\n Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet – Twilight Masquerade is available on May 24.

          "description": "Stray Gods: The Role-Playing Musical, a creative and ambitious attempt to fuse musical theatre with interactive fiction, launched last August, but that's not the last time fans will get to experience that modern take on Greek myth. Announced today at LudoNarraCon, the game is getting DLC called Stray Gods: Orpheus, which follows the titular character through a new adventure. Check out the reveal trailer below.\n\n\nOrpheus (played by Rent star Anthony Rapp) appeared in the base game, but only briefly, so this expansion will give players a better idea of his backstory and personality. The trailer also features Hermes (played by Erika Ishii), though their exact role in the DLC isn't clarified. The experience is roughly two hours long with six new interactive tracks and features some returning songwriters, including Austin Wintory, Simon Hall, and Montaigne, but also adds comedic musician Tom Cardy to the mix.\nAs for the plot, the following excerpt from a press release explains what to expect. \"When the curtain has fallen and the show is over, who do you go home as?\" it reads. \"Choose to reject, embrace, or rewrite the stories the world expects of you. Is the mortal world ready for the return of Ancient Greece’s most infamous bard?\"\n\nStray Gods: Orpheus hits PC on June 27, with a console release date \"coming soon.\" For more Stray Gods, check out our feature on how it was made.

          "description": "More cuts at Xbox are reportedly on the way, with some staff at ZeniMax getting offered voluntary severance agreements this week. This news comes from a Bloomberg report that says employees across the Xbox organization have been told to expect more cuts. \nThese potential layoffs would follow Xbox's decision to shutter four Bethesda studios earlier this week, including Hi-Fi Rush team Tango Gameworks and Redfall developer Arkane Austin. As for the staff offered voluntary severance agreements, Bloomberg reports that producers, quality assurance testers, and other staff at ZeniMax are receiving them. \n\n\nThe publication also reports the reason Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin were shut down this week is that they were in the process of pitching new projects and hiring additional staff for said projects, something suggested by ZeniMax head Jill Braff and Xbox president Matt Booty during a town hall held this week. Xbox and ZeniMax chose to shut these studios down – both in the beginning processes of creating new games – instead of closing a studio deeper in development on projects. \nElsewhere in Bloomberg's report, which details an internal town hall held at Xbox following the studio closures this week, Booty reportedly described its studios as spread too thin, like \"peanut butter on bread,\" and that leaders across the company felt understaffed. Xbox closed three studios and had ZeniMax Online Studios absorb Roundhouse Games to free up resources. Braff said during the meeting, \"It's hard to support nine studios all across the world with a lean central team with an ever-growing plate of things to do. I think we were about to topple over.\" \nThese studio closures follow the January layoffs of 1,900 employees at Xbox, Activision Blizzard, and ZeniMax, which add to the total of more than 10,000 laid off in the games industry just this year. \n[Source: Bloomberg]\nHow do you feel about Xbox?

However, its release arrives at a rocky period for Xbox, which just shuttered four Bethesda studios, including Hi-Fi Rush team Tango Gameworks and Redfall developer Arkane Austin. As a result, Xbox players have wondered how safe Hellblade II developer Ninja Theory might be after its sequel's release, given Hi-Fi Rush was a \"break out hit\" for the company but wasn't enough to keep Tango open. \nPerhaps to help boost Hellblade II's sales, Xbox is reportedly considering bringing the game to PlayStation 5, according to The Verge. The publication's Tom Warren writes, \"I understand Hellblade II is another game that Microsoft has been considering for the PS5. If that ever happens, at this point, it's not clear if even that would be considered a success.\" \n\n\nHellblade II coming to PS5 wouldn't be out of left field, considering Xbox has brought previously exclusive games like Grounded, Sea of Thieves, and Hi-Fi Rush to PS5 this year. However, with the launch of Hellblade II happening in just a few weeks, it seems if it does come to PS5, it will be post-launch, which lines up with Xbox's strategy in this realm thus far. \nSenua's Saga: Hellblade II hits Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 21, 2024. \nFor more about the game, check out the Senua's Saga: Hellblade II PC specs and system requirements, and then read about how Senua's Saga: Hellblade II will be locked to 30 FPS on Xbox Series X/S. After that, read about how the game will have a photo mode at launch. \n[Source: The Verge]\nDo you hope Xbox brings Senua's Saga: Hellblade II to PS5? Let us know in the comments below!",

          "description": "MultiVersus makes its grand return on May 28, and a new trailer reveals that the Joker is joining the roster. Even better, Mark Hamill is voicing the Clown Prince of Crime once more.\nThough we don’t see gameplay, a cinematic trailer sets up a dramatic confrontation (and likely emotional reunion for fans) between Batman, voiced in the game by the late Kevin Conroy, and his archnemesis. \n\n\nThis marks the first game to feature both Batman: The Animated Series actors together as their respective characters since 2018’s Lego DC Super Villans. Conroy passed away in 2022, and prior to 2024's Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, MultiVersus was the final game to feature his Batman performance. Following his death, Hamill had alluded to retiring the Joker role for good. However, dataminers uncovered Joker’s existence in MultiVersus in 2022 and found audio files revealing Hamill’s performance. This means he likely recorded his lines before Conroy’s passing. \nJoker is the first new character to join the existing line-up of fighters, but he won't be the last. We're curious to see who else joins the fray after MultiVersus re-launches on May 28 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.",

          "description": "Arkane Austin was reportedly set to release a big Redfall update this month that would have added offline play to the always-online game before Microsoft suddenly shut the studio down, according to IGN. This follows yesterday's news that Microsoft was shutting down Arkane Austin, Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks, Mighty Doom studio Alpha Dog Games, and absorbing Roundhouse Games into ZeniMax Online Studios.\nThis offline play update would have addressed one of players' biggest complaints with the game – that Redfall always requires a connection to the internet – but now that update will never see the light of day. It's an especially concerning detail considering now that Arkane Austin is closed, the day when Redfall servers are no longer live, rendering the game unplayable, seems closer than ever before. \n\n\nIGN also reports that it was told the now-canceled Hero Pass, which would have added two additional playable characters to Redfall, was scheduled for release around Halloween. It obviously won't be released now – Bethesda says those who purchased the Hero Pass will be eligible \"to receive the value of the upgrade\" – but if it had hit the game around Halloween, that would have been roughly 18 months after Redfall's launch. \nRedfall hit Xbox Series X/S and PC on May 2 to poor reviews from critics – read Game Informer's review here – and players alike, and the first-person multiplayer vampire shooter failed to recover, with Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer saying, \"I'm upset with myself,\" when asked about its launch.\nAccording to reports, some of Arkane Austin's staff hoped Microsoft might cancel Redfall or reboot it as a single player game, following the former's acquisition of ZeniMax Media in 2020 for $7.5 billion. Arkane Austin director Harvey Smith said Microsoft canceled a PlayStation 5 version of Redfall following this acquisition. \n[Source: IGN]\nHow do you feel about Microsoft shutting down Arkane Austin?

          "description": "The success of Marvel Snap rolls on, as does the seasonal structure of the free-to-play, deck-building card-battler from Second Dinner. Recent seasons have been themed after corners of the Marvel Universe, like Avengers vs. X-Men or Thunderbolts, but this season leans a bit more into the Marvel Multiverse with Blink and the Exiles. This season, titled \"A Blink in Time,\" introduces five new characters, two new locations, and more.\nThe new characters joining the game in A Blink in Time are as follows:\nBlink (5 Cost, 7 Power)\n\n\t\nOn reveal, swap the last card you played with a higher-cost card from your deck.\n\n\t\nNocturne (3 Cost, 5 Power)\n\t\nYou can move this once. When this moves, replace its location with a random new one.\n\n\t\nSage (3 Cost, 0 Power)\n\t\nOn reveal, +2 power for each different power among all other cards here.\n\n\t\nNamora (5 Cost, 6 Power)\n\t\nOn reveal, give +5 power to each of your cards alone at another location.\n\n\t\nSasquatch (6 Cost, 10 Power)\n\t\nCosts 1 less for each card you played last turn.\n\n                  \n\nOn top of those all-new characters joining Marvel Snap collections, there are two new locations: Panoptichron, where cards that didn't start in your deck get +2 power, and Cancun, where power at that location doesn't count toward winning the game. New albums featuring Dan Hipp and Rian Gonzales also further incentivize Variant collections by rewarding items themed after Werewolf By Night, Silk, and Iron Lad. Finally, we know the dates of the Series 5 releases of this season. Baron Zemo and Nocturne get their Series 5 release on May 7, Sage arrives on May 14, Namora on May 21, and Sasquatch on May 28.\nMarvel Snap's May season, A Blink in Time, kicks off today.

This news arrives at the same time Nintendo has revealed it will announce the Switch successor by March 2025, meaning there's still some time for the Switch to catch up to Nintendo's best-selling console: the Nintendo DS. \nSince the last financial results call, the Switch has sold an additional 1.96 million units, bringing its grand total up to 141.32. That keeps it in second place, only behind the Nintendo DS' massive 154.02 million. It's possible the Switch surpasses the Nintendo DS, especially considering the Switch will likely continue to sell even once its successor is released, but that's a big 13 million-unit gap to close. \n\n\nElsewhere in the financial results, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has hit 20.28 million units sold, Super Mario Bros. Wonder has sold through 11.96 million, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe another 6.79 million, and Pikmin 4 3.33 million. The fiscal year ending with March 2024 was a strong one for Switch software, selling 163.95 million units in Q1 through Q3 of Fiscal Year 2024. However, compared to the same quarters for Fiscal Year 2023, Switch software is down 4.7%. \nWith the Switch successor on the horizon, that number will likely be way up this time next year. \nIn the meantime, read about the Nintendo Direct happening next month, and then check out Game Informer's top 10 Switch games.

However, the company says there will be no mention of this successor during a Nintendo Direct it is holding in June; this Direct will instead be focused on the games coming to Switch in the second half of 2024. \nWhile this isn't the first hint of a Switch successor from the company, it is the most direct and comes from the same financial results where we learned the Switch has sold an additional 1.96 million units since the last one, bringing its total up to 141.32 million.

          "description": "Hades II, the much-anticipated sequel to Supergian's excellent roguelike, is entering Early Access today and is on the cover of Game Informer Magazine with incredible original art by acclaimed artist Jen Zee. Join Alex Van Aken – who visited Supergiant for the cover story and has played Hades II extensively – and myself for a look at the game's second area and boss fight. Spoilers ahead if you want to experience the locations and enemies for yourself, but otherwise, enjoy this New Gameplay Today episode!\nThis second area in Hades II is called Oceanus, an underwater realm Melinoë uses to bypass the armies of Chronos, the game's antagonist and Titan of Time. Oceanus is generally more difficult to navigate than Erebus, the first area, due to explosive hazards, more powerful ranged enemies, and darting schools of swordfish. The level culminates in a musical boss fight against a rock band of sirens led by Scylla, a well-known sea monster from Greek myth. Scylla sings while her keyboardist and drummer back her up. Despite sharing one health bar, the individual monsters can be stunned and knocked out of the fight, muting the appropriate instruments in the active music track.\nSee Oceanus And The Scylla Boss Fight In Action:\n\n\nHead to Game Informer's YouTube channel for more previews, reviews, and discussions of new and upcoming games.

The cover story reveals why Supergiant decided to create its first sequel, how it chose a new protagonist in Zagreus' sister, Melinoë, along with her mythological origins, and how the team is changing its approach to early access and the content it has planned for the future.

However, a PSN account will be required to play through Ghost of Tsushima's multiplayer Legends mode, or if you want to use the new PlayStation PC overlay to acquire trophies and more. \nThis follows news from last week where PlayStation announced (and later walked back) that Helldivers 2 players will soon be required to link a PSN account to their Steam account, leading to widespread anger in the game's community. It seems Sucker Punch is looking to get ahead of this by revealing its PSN plans ahead of the game's launch in 10 days. \nThank you for your feedback.\nMay 3, 2024\nIf you're unfamiliar with Ghost of Tsushima: Legends, it's a standalone multiplayer experience that allows you and up to three other players to fight enemies in special missions, defeat waves of foes, and complete raids. A PSN account will be required to play Legends, but if you want to play through the game's story (and Iki Island expansion), you won't need one. \nGhost of Tsushima hit PlayStation 4 on July 17, 2020, before launching on PlayStation 5 with a Director's Cut on August 20, 2021. This is the version of the game hitting PC in 10 days on May 16, 2024.\nFor more about the game, read Game Informer's Ghost of Tsushima review, and then read about why the Director's Cut of Ghost of Tsushima is a must-play for fans. \n[Source: VideoGamesChronicle]\nAre you going to play Ghost of Tsushima on PC?
