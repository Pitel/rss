The game is inspired by the My Summer Vacation series and has been developed by the same team, Millennium Kitchen.\nOriginally released in Japan last year, we didn't expect we'd ever see it in the West. But we were pleasantly surprised a few months ago when publisher Neos Corporation revealed the game would be coming out in English this summer! One of the biggest reasons we were surprised is that none of the My Summer Vacation games made their way over to the West, but we still wanted to celebrate the upcoming Shin-Chan game's release by playing one of Millennium Kitchen's games.

          "description": "Is \"more of the same\" going to be enough?\nSplatoon 3 is just a handful of weeks away from launch, with the sequel heading to the Switch on September 9th. Despite the fact that Nintendo has been drip-feeding bits of news here and there on Twitter, including new songs, gear reveals, and new multiplayer maps, there's a distinct feeling amongst the community that the marketing around the game has been a bit lacklustre.\nIt's no surprise, either. The launch of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 has understandably taken up a lot of Nintendo's time over the past few weeks, with the company bombarding fans with new trailers, gameplay footage, interviews, and more. Now that the game is out, though, can we expect Nintendo to shift its focus over to Splatoon 3? Well, yes, theoretically. That hasn't stopped some fans from getting quite worried, though, particularly in the wake of a new Pokémon Presents being announced for later this week (though we fully acknowledge that this is more of a Pokémon Company event rather than a Nintendo one):\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Originally released in 1991, the game was developed by Toaplan, but after the company's bankruptcy in 1994, most of its IP rights went over to Tatsujin.\nAs reported by Go Nintendo, the remaster will launch under the title Spy Bros. (Pipi & Bibi’s DX) and is currently targeted for Q4 2022. The publisher has announced that little is being done to alter the game's visuals and mechanics, with the developer opting to stay true to the original's aethetics, however design improvements and bonus content will be included in the new release (so it's probably more of a modern port than a remaster).\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Out on Xbox One, PS4, Switch, and PC, the game combines visual novel elements with some strategy RPG gameplay, and is a very different Digimon game altogether.\nHowever, despite some fans' excitement at getting this much-delayed Digimon game, Digimon Survive is currently being review bombed over on Metacritic. TheGamer reports that users are flocking to the aggregate website to share their opinions and score the game down.

Apparently, however, according to a recent video from Did You Know Gaming, Shulk's actions during one of the game's cutscenes alarmed scenario writer Yurie Hattori, who was brought in during the game's development.\nAs pointed out by series' Executive Director Tetsuya Takahashi, Hattori-san was worried that Shulk's decision to touch the cheek of an unconscious Fiora to express his feelings for her might be construed as creepy. As such, the action was changed for the final game, with Shulk instead touching Fiora's hand.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

With its character-focused racing and themed tracks, it was inevitable — especially on the Switch! But, in an interview with Nintendo Everything, the developer is keen to set out what makes this title stand out from Nintendo's juggernaut kart racer.\nWhile Mario Kart 8 has different types of karts, stats, and even racer weights, Disney Speedstorm will have four different classes. When asked about what makes this game \"stand out\", Gameloft Barcelona's game manager — Aska Suzuki — put forward this unique element first:\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "It's also been renamed for its Steam launch.\nMassage Freaks, the raunchy rthythm game from publisher qureate, has been quietly released on Steam. Not only that, but it's also received a complete name change and is now called 'beat refle', which sounds like a bit of a play on the term 'Reflexology'. It's certainly a more \"neutral\" title, that's for sure.\nThe release follows a storm of controversy following the initial reveal of Massage Freaks. Its depiction of women and the scenarios in which they find themselves caused many to draw comparisons to real-life sex crimes in Japan. In addition, the forenames of the in-game characters were identical to some of the members of Japanese idol group 'Hinatazaka46' before qureate swifly made moves to alter them. Indeed, the Steam page for beat refle contains a few choice statements to potentially avoid any future controversy:\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

Fortunately, that seems to be more than just pastel colours and cynical “For girls” marketing – the G375 headset, G705 mouse, and the G715 and G713 keyboards are all proper gaming-spec accessories, and they’ve been crafted by mostly female design and engineering teams based on feedback from women PC players.\r\n\n\r\nThe G705, then, is a wireless mouse designed for smaller hands, while the G375 headset – also wireless – is proportioned to fit smaller heads and has more space in the earcups to accommodate earrings. It’s safe to say I’m not the Aurora Collection’s target audience, but having used the G705, the G375, and the G715 wireless keyboard as my main peripherals for a few days, I can say all three are pretty swish playthings regardless of how you identify. What’s more, their light, soft-cornered aesthetic is a nice break from the blacks, greys and harsh angles that have become standard design language for gaming gear. Anyone who’s ever cringed their face inside out at a peripheral resembling Megatron’s running shoe may indeed find these more to their tastes.\r\n\n \nRead more",

The story of Wolfenstein 3D’s development makes for a fascinating time capsule of those early days of game development - a milestone in gaming history that underlines just how much the industry has grown over the decades since.\nBut that’s getting ahead of ourselves a bit. The origins of Wolfenstein 3D, a gloriously violent game that paved the way for the even more gloriously violent Doom, can be found in a somewhat more cutesy series of titles: the Commander Keen series. id Software made four of these side-scrolling platformers for MS-DOS in very quick succession between 1990 and 1991, and studio co-founder John Romero tells us that the team was definitely ready for a change.\nRead more",

With nowhere else to go, she’s decided to take the bus back to her hometown of Timber Hills to move back in with her parents (hopefully, temporarily). While she's killing time on the journey, she begins to take a dating personality quiz aptly titled ‘What’s your Thirstsona?’ and it transports her to a colourful dreamlike metaverse where she can skate around and answer deep questions about her love life.

I know which one I prefer, because the story mode is a love letter to Half-Life 2, complete with Bane-muffled jackboot cops, endlessly catching up with a Story Guy who's inexplicably ahead of you again, a bionic arm standing in for the gravity gun, and a spooky dark underground section where you're swarmed by creepy mutants.

This makes it a good time to pick up a SATA drive for desktops or laptops that can't accommodate another M.2 drive, especially for media or game storage where the speed difference between SATA and NVMe is minimal. \nToday, Teamgroup's imaginatively-named T-Force Vulcan Z drive is down to $128 for a 2TB model, the lowest price we can find for this size at present. \nNote that to get this price, you do need to be an Amazon Prime member - normal folk you like and me will see a price of $160 instead, alongside a reminder to 'join Prime to save $32 on this item'. You should be able to join Prime under a free trial, order the item and then cancel your Prime status to avoid a charge. \nRead more",

Linux is a completely free operating system, unlike Windows, so you can knock £50 off the purchase price just by ticking this box - and of course, you're free to install Windows 10 or 11 afterwards. Keys for Windows 7/8/10 work on Windows 11 too, so you probably already have a key lying around - or you can pick up a new one for less than £50 online. The whole process, from using the Windows 11 Media Creation Tool to prepare a USB install drive to reaching the desktop, only takes around 20 to 30 minutes - well worth it!\nRead more",

          "description": "I’ve been excited to play Exoprimal, Capcom’s upcoming multiplayer dino shooter, ever since it used the phrase “unstoppable raptor horde” in one of its trailers. It is a completely unhinged combination of words that makes me giddy just thinking about them. I’ll often find myself muttering them out loud when I’m unloading the dishwasher or folding laundry. “Unstoppable raptor horde”. It’s like the season finale of language. It’s perfect.\r\n\n\r\nAdmittedly, prior to the existence of that phrase, I was feeling a little sceptical about Exoprimal’s existence. Not only does Capcom have - let’s say - a less than favourable track record when it comes to multiplayer titles, but as a long-term fan of Dino Crisis I was a bit miffed to see them creating a game featuring prehistoric creatures that wasn’t some kind of lavish remake of my beloved PS1 series.\r\n\n \nRead more",

I haven't done that with Hob's Barrow yet,\" he says. \"Basically, Victorian gothic horror story. That's the best way to describe it.\"\nOriginally announced as Incantamentum (Gilbert jokes that one of the reasons behind the name change is because he could never pronounce \"Incantamentum\" correctly), Wadjet Eye got involved after Gilbert played the Steam demo last year and emailed the developer. \"I said, 'Hey, I played the demo. I really liked it. Please tell me you're going to be adding voice acting to this because it's screaming for it',\" Gilbert tells me. \"And he said, 'Well, we will if we can find a publisher who'll do it for us.'\" So now Wadjet Eye are publishing, and Gilbert is overseeing the voice recording.\nRead more",

At least when your heist strategy's going according to plan, that is. In an exclusive demo for one of the later levels in Hard West 2, the upcoming sequel to the 2015 turn-based tactics original, Ice Code Games' chief technology officer Mateusz Pilski is starting to feel the heat a bit. The bank is well guarded, with at least half a dozen gunslingers staking out the doors at the front, and untold numbers waiting in hidden nooks and crannies further back. He takes a moment to consider his approach, but he begins his assault with confidence.  \n\"In any XCOM-like, when you see that many enemies and that much firepower, in that good a position, you think, okay, I'm fucked up,\" he tells me. \"In just a second, I will show you how you can use Bravado to totally overturn the situation.\"\nRead more",

Not the kind of hype-building you’d expect, given how many of the current generation’s best graphics cards have GeForce badges.\r\n\n\r\nArriving to fill that info void are, inevitably, leaks. If you don’t regularly hang out in PC hardware circles, know that there’s a veritable cottage industry of in-the-know insiders: anonymous but widely known tipsters like Greymon55 and kopite7kimi, who’ve shared enough accurate details on previous GPU and CPU launches that at least some of their sources are solid. Recently, unannounced Nvidia cards like the RTX 4070, RTX 4080 and especially the RTX 4090 have become this industry’s hottest commodities, meaning leakers are also the primary source of GeForce details for the gaming tech world at large.\r\n\n \nRead more",

There's two in total: one that goes over basic techniques, and another that focuses on advanced mechanics. Both of them run the gamut of the game's tutorial system, and really, the advanced booklet isn't a bad thing to have near you as you're learning the game.\nInterestingly, they fold in such a way that they can be turned into actual booklets. They even have a full page dedicated to folding and cutting! If you're game for a crafting project that requires identifying \"mountain fold lines and valley fold lines\" you're set this afternoon. As an added bonus: Thankfully, Nintendo has crafted the booklets to ensure they can both be stored in the actual Mario Strikers: Battle League case.\nIf only you could order physical manuals for every first-party Nintendo game\nI get wanting to cut down on environmental footprints, but providing a \"print on demand\" service for manuals sounds like a really interesting potential market opportunity. Even if they were sparing and linked to the My Nintendo physical goods system, there's something there.\nThe post Nintendo made printable strategy booklets for Mario Strikers Switch appeared first on Destructoid.",

The collection will include RayForce (1994), RayStorm (1996), and RayCrisis (1998). Also included are two brand new remasters, RayCrisis HD and RayStorm NEO-HD. The latter title is itself a remaster of a remaster, boosted with new extra features and vital 16:9 monitor support.\nRayStorm x RayCrisis HD Collection, which seems a strangely redundant alternate collection, will apparently include all of the same titles listed above but will omit the original RayForce.\nhttps://twitter.com/ININ_Games/status/1553365037355606017?s=20&t=VgjMbozrmZ52t9WVf0RFyg\nRayStorm x RayCrisis HD Collection will be made available digitally and physically, while Ray'z Arcade Chronology will launch digitally worldwide and will receive an exclusive physical release via boutique outlet Strictly Limited Games. This edition features a boxed release of the game alongside additional collectible memorabilia including a CD soundtrack, a strategy guide, old-school arcade-style stickers, a hardcover art book, and other neat goodies.\n\nRay'z Arcade Chronology and RayStorm x RayCrisis HD Collection are currently in development for PS4 and Nintendo Switch We will be sure to give you a heads up when new information regarding western launch dates is made available.\nThe post The RayStorm / RayCrisis remasters confirmed for western release appeared first on Destructoid.",

The irrepressible, unstoppable, unavoidable meme nightmare Neco-Arc is headed to the roster of Melty Blood: Type Lumina.\nNeco-Arc, the bizarrely drawn parody mascot of the Tsuskihime franchise, has finally decided the time is right to take her pint-sized form and terrifying, oversized eyes into the ring, where she will square off against the mystical maidens of Melty Blood.

          "description": "The mod creator is redrawing cutscenes\nEl Gato Del Tejado is taking it upon themselves to craft a Simpsons Hit and Run remaster, and it's going extremely well so far.\nIn the first half of the latest development video, the mod creator walks us through some in-engine shots of the project; giving us an update on some of the game's character models, namely Lisa Simpson. They chronicle the journey of getting a 3D model to show up correctly in-game — and folks, it ain't easy!\nBut by far the big deal here is how the creator chose to alter the game's cutscenes. Originally they wanted to see cutscenes with \"modern 3D technology\" like the latest Crash re-releases, but without much experience in 3D animation, they opted for 2D. Deciding to \"do it by hand,\" they learned the animation style of the show, consulting series bibles to get it done (which series creator Matt Groening has documented endlessly). To my amazement, it basically looks like the show.\nThe results are....insane. Multiple comparison shots are provided in the video below, which are near indistinguishable from certain eras of The Simpsons on TV. At this point, the project is basically a resume. Hire this person!

The figures show something of a disparity between sectors. While gaming revenue on a whole is down, the Xbox Game Pass subscription model continues to grow, with millions of players utilizing the online service. The news was delivered in an investor earnings call called transcribed by GamesIndustry.biz.\nMicrosoft gaming revenue fell by some 7% year-on-year, which translates to somewhere in the region of $260 million USD. While this is, of course, a huge figure, it is still a drop in the ocean in comparison to the $3 billion overall revenue generated by the Microsoft brand during the three-month period. In addition, Xbox hardware revenue has decreased by 11%, which is disappointing given that we're still, essentially, in the honeymoon period of new-gen platform Xbox Series X/S. Despite this decrease, Microsoft states that the new platform is selling faster than previous Xbox generations, and that Xbox currently leading the market in sales over rival platform PlayStation 5.\nMicrosoft's ace-in-the-hole continues to be the Xbox Game Pass service, which continues to welcome more subscribers with each passing month. In addition, Microsoft's recent partnership with Epic Games facilitated four million players logging into battle royale juggernaut Fortnite via Xbox Cloud Gaming, over a million players being entirely new to the Xbox infrastructure. Despite us being instilled into the ninth generation, it seems that — for both Microsoft and Sony — the current success trend lies not so much in the individual hardware and/or software sales, but in the services, game libraries, day-one launches, and other utilities that their respective subscription services provide.\nMicrosoft Q4 gaming revenues decline, but Game Pass grows [GamesIndustry.biz]\nThe post Microsoft hit with gaming revenue decline, but Xbox Game Pass still prosperous appeared first on Destructoid.",

I even took around 200 new ones as we were wrapping up development, so it's hard to believe they're already gone.

Amazingly, Sakurai confirmed that he'd have to stop doing it eventually on December 26, 2021, but has kept going since then. The reason for the shift is because he is no longer using development kits/tools.\nIt's been a fun run!

          "description": "Kill the Wabbit\nThis past weekend saw fight fans lock horns in Warner Bros.' brand new scrapper MultiVersus, the crossover fighter having just launched its open access beta on PC and console platforms — and while the fur has only been flying for a few days, already characters are queued up to have their wings clipped by developer Player First Games.\nIn something of an obscure tweet posted this weekend, MultiVersus director Tony Huynh noted that \"Nerfs Inc.\" would be headed to the title post-EVO (which takes place in Las Vegas this weekend). While no specific characters were announced for the chopping block, Huynh added that \"Bugs Bunny will always be fun.\"\nhttps://twitter.com/Tony_Huynh/status/1552517058918682624?s=20&t=unq02SbgfNGQK4ddQ-VM9A\nNo doubt Huynh is pointing toward the fact that the carrot-chomping smart arse is already proving to be something of a dominant player within MultiVersus' crossover world. Bugs has seemingly overshot Taz as somebody singled out as something of a problem character for players, after the latter had his devastating Tornado Spin attack scaled right down scant hours into the beta's launch.\nIn a chaotic platform fighter such as MultiVersus, it can be difficult to accurately ascertain who may have a leg-up on the competition. Add to that the way ALL fighting game players call for nerfs within minutes of a title's launch, and it takes a sharp developer to truly ascertain which characters are actually broken and which characters players are simply \"losing to\" as they aren't bothering to learn the matchup.\nEither way, MultiVersus has had an immensely healthy beta launch, with over 144,000 players logging into Steam at its peak period. We shall see how the title retains its audience over the coming weeks and months. MultiVersus is now in open beta on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\nThe post The nerf mallet may be coming for Bugs Bunny in MultiVersus appeared first on Destructoid.",

Instead of being packed out with screaming, tattoed gals sporting cool names like \"Anna Geddon\", this digital take on hard-hitting wheeled warfare features a bunch of boring 8-bit dudes. We were still a good six years away from the debut of the outrageous, WWE-like show Rollergames, and thus Roller Jammer boasts a less glamorous, simplistic take on the sport.\nCheck out the action in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Old Classic Retro Gaming.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqW8NZ3bQ_8\nPerhaps understanding that it does not have tech available to recreate the ins and outs of roller derby proper, Nichibutsu chooses to play a little fast and loose with its adaptation of the sport, tasking playing with gunning through thin slaloms of flags before eventually engaging in an every-man-for-themselves race, complete with a hilarious \"double lariat\" maneuver. While Roller Jammer's relative obscurity makes this Arcade Archives release a little notable, ultimately it's pretty difficult to recommend this title.\nRoller Jammer is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.\nThe post Whip it Good: Roller Jammer skates into the Arcade Archives appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "I guess there are no more tombs to raid... for now\nHollywood has already taken two different shots at the Tomb Raider franchise, starring Angelina Jolie and Alicia Vikander respectively, but it looks like there's a chance another actress will get a chance to helm the series, as TheWrap reports. The film rights to Tomb Raider are up for grabs yet again after MGM failed to make a sequel after the 2018 film, which would have allowed them to keep the rights — although there were plans to make another film in the series at one point.\nThe most likely factor in plans for the sequel fizzling out is Amazon's acquisition of MGM back in March of this year. There's a good chance that with the merger going on, any projects in the works were put on pause, which is unfortunate when there's a ticking clock for maintaining your IPs. Fans had a lukewarm reaction regarding the 2018 movie, but it did fairly well at the box office internationally, so it's kind of a shame that they're not getting a second chance with Vikander's version of Croft.\n\nTomb Raider's treasure-hunting counterpart Uncharted (also sometimes called Dude Raider by fans) did quite well in the box office this year, raking in just over $400 million, and securing its spot as the fourth most profitable video game movie to date. It's hard to say whether this had to do with its star-studded cast, which included Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg, or if fans just liked the movie more, but either way, I think it shows that fans are still down for an Indiana Jones-inspired action adventure.\nThere's a good chance that we'll be getting another reboot of the Tomb Raider franchise from whoever picks up the rights, so here's hoping that the third time's a charm for the franchise. Until then, there's always the Tomb Raider anime that Netflix still has in the works.\nThe post Tomb Raider film rights are up in the air after MGM lost out appeared first on Destructoid.",

It also contains a desert area and looks to be just as sizable as the game's other areas.</p>\n\n<p>The trailer also introduces a host of companion characters that players will meet as quests are completed. The first new character is Tighnari, a forest watcher who we see holding a magical firefly. In Port Ormos, players will run into Alhaitham from the Haravatat in the Akademiya. Further into the game, players meet Dehya of the Desertfolk, who is also a mercenary for the&nbsp;Emerites. There are also Nilou, a character who is pursuing art and dance, Nahida, a mysterious being, and Cyno, the General Mahamatra.</p>\n\n<p>All of this content is a part of Genshin Impact's 03 update, which doesn't have a release date yet, but appears to be close, given how much miHoYo has revealed.

As a major fan of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, I was thrilled to see Ubisoft dive back into piracy, this time with a new IP. At that point, Skull and Bones was a 5v5 multiplayer arena battler where you played solely as the ship. It wasn't exactly the Black Flag follow-up many, including myself, had anticipated, but with Ubisoft Singapore, the studio behind the Assassin's Creed franchise's excellent naval combat, at the helm, I wanted to see more. </p>\n\n<p>After another look at it in 2018, Skull and Bones went dark…",

You can pick up a set that includes a “you can’t see me” emote, WWE Championship Title Back Bling, and Five Digit Slapper pickaxe. Personally, I’m chuckling at the idea of the PG-friendly Cena adjusting attitudes with guns instead of bodyslams.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>While Cena isn’t the first wrestler to appear in Fornite – <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/02/03/the-foundation-played-by-dwayne-the-rock-johnson-now-unlockable-in-fortnite\" target=\"_blank\">Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson</a> has him beat there – it’s cool to see regardless, and, as a wrestling fan, I hope this&nbsp;trend continues. Fortnite already acts as the ultimate&nbsp;“forbidden door” for various media properties, so let's throw&nbsp;more sports entertainment into the mix&nbsp;by adding stars from WWE, AEW, Impact, New Japan, and other promotions. That would certainly entice me to dive back into action.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Do you plan on chasing victory royales as Big Match John? Let us know in the comments!&nbsp;</p>",

As you explore the post-apocalyptic world, have you given it one yourself? If so, what name have you settled on?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Admittedly, I’m still figuring that out myself. I still have a good ways to go in Stray, and I’ve batted around a few options as I hopped across rooftops and meowed at robots. Some are more elaborate, like \"Chester A. Tabby II\" (the successor to my Palico’s name in Monster Hunter: World); others are more simple, like “Creamsicle,\" which has been growing on me.&nbsp;I’m hoping your responses inspire&nbsp;me to concoct the purr-fect moniker. I'm sorry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So let’s hear it: what do you call the cat in Stray? There are no wrong answers. Well, unless you named it “Dog.” Then we’ll have to snitch on you to the Cat Police. The Cats-apo? I'm going to stop now. Share your responses below!</p>",

In the trailer above, we see her acrobatic maneuvers make short work of a gang. The footage also shows what appears to be a boss fight and a couple of alternate skins that players can unlock for Barbara Gordon.</p>\n\n<p>Slated to release on October 25 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, Gotham Knights tells the story of a Batman-less superhero world and shows how his wards rise to take his place. The playable characters are Robin, Nightwing, Red Hood, and Batgirl. You can play whoever you want, and it won't disrupt the game's cooperative play. Warner Bros. allows two Batgirls to run together, should players wish to attain an Elseworlds vibe.</p>\n\n<p>The skins shown in the video will likely need to be unlocked by finding blueprints and acquiring the proper crafting materials to build them.</p>\n\n<p>Following the success of Rocksteady's Arkham series and Warner Bros. Montreal's contribution, Gotham Knights has enormous shoes to fill. Here's hoping it's every bit as good as the titles mentioned. We need another great Arkham-like game.</p>",
