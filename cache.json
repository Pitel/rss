          "description": "Qotroidvania.\nOver the past few years, Atari has been revisiting its storied history with compilation titles, remakes, reboots, and surprise sequels. So while a revival of Yars’ Revenge really shouldn’t have come as much of a surprise, we have to admit to being a bit taken aback by Yars Rising. After all, what was once a stylish, yet basic top-down shooter has now been transformed into a full-blown Metroidvania with anime-inspired character design, a bonkers, world-ending plot, and gameplay that blends stealth, hacking, and good ol’-fashioned gunplay. Atari, yer mad.\nThe thing is, though, it works. We can’t imagine that this is the future kids in the early ‘80s had in mind when they first shoved that massive Yars’ Revenge cartridge into an Atari 2600 (and maybe OG developer Howard Scott Warshaw’s long-gestating sequel will be more on par with expectations), but after completing Yars Rising, we honestly couldn’t be more thrilled by developer WayForward’s ambitious interpretation of such a classic.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

          "description": "A baby's gotta do what a baby's gotta do.\nThat Rugrats has somehow managed to remain in the public consciousness for so long is impressive in its own right. This is in part down to Nickelodeon continuing to screen it for younger generations, and that the show ran for 13 years across 172 episodes and spawned two feature films. The most important reason for its extended shelf life, though, is its unexpectedly broad appeal. Formulated by Hungarian-born Gábor Csupó and his wife, Arlene Klasky, Rugrats appeared to be a show about babies for babies, but it was actually a show about babies for children and adults. Thanks to clever writing and a deeper maturity — commonplace during the Simpsons-inspired '90s — those who loved it 30 years ago will still enjoy it today.\nRugrats: Adventures in Gameland’s most essential victory, then, isn’t necessarily its stage design or graphical style, but tapping into the show's intelligence. It's a shame the original voice cast is unavailable, with exchanges instead represented in text, but you can still recall Tommy’s raspy tones in your head.\nRead the full article on nintendolife.com",

All those onscreen 'Nids, yeah? And the stutterfest that was the recent preview build? Surely enough to make a Tech-Priest shed at least one oily tear.\nBut nah, turns out it’s fine. Pretty good, actually – perhaps not to the extent that you should tackle Space Marine 2 on a crusty notebook (or, for the record, a Steam Deck), but it runs decently on minimum specs and is noticeably more stable than in that preview. The only thing that might offend your PC’s machine spirit is some quality setting weirdness, where dropping or raising the graphics options can produce inconsistent results.\nRead more",

          "description": "Bear with me on this, but I adore how swordfighting works in Dune. Ubiquitous wearable sci-fi shields repel any attack that comes in too fast, so everyone has to learn this unique, overtly dance-like form of close-quarters combat where every thrust and parry is necessarily slow and considered. Picture it: careful judgments of your movements, weighing up the right time to strike, every measured jab part of a wider strategy that culminates in the kill.\nMOBAs are like that. Both in the fights themselves, sort of, where probing lunges lead up to bursts of lethality, but more broadly in each match as a whole. They’re map-wide knife fights, where a thrust is a well-judged lane push and a parry a savvy item buy. At first, playing Smite 2 felt akin to watching on helplessly as my opponents repeatedly shoved their crysknives through my ribs. After 30 hours, it often still feels like that - but I am enjoying myself. Mostly. Despite Valve’s third-person elephant in the lane. \nRead more",

          "description": "Nikhil Murthy's Syphilisation is a \"postcolonial 4X game\", which might sound like a contradiction in terms. While approaches to 4X and grand strategy vary hugely between games, factions and players, the genre as a whole is firmly wedded to imperial conquest, both structurally and at the level of narrative aspects and set-dressing. Many 4X games are triumphal re-enactments of specific periods of colonial settlement and expansion. All of which is to say that Syphilisation is fascinating. It's a reworking of the genre which dismantles and reconstructs concepts such as diplomacy, research and production. It's also just left early access - find more details and a playthrough video below.\n Read more",

While it wasn't outstanding in the grander landscape of gaming, enough Warhammer 40K fans seem to have cherished the escapades of bulky blue boltgunner Demetrian Titus for the action game to merit a sequel a decade later. It left its story on something of a cliffhanger, with said hero being dragged away to face untold tortures by the Inquisition, the most zealous sect of this preternaturally paranoid sci-fi universe. Today, Titus is free again. Free to stomp towards hordes of alien foes, blast them with a plasma incinerator, and shred the stragglers with a chainsaw sword. Space Marine 2 is an often-satisfying scrapper that has me  convinced of 40K's merit as a crafting ground for excellent-looking environments and creatures, even if I'm not particularly moved by the bland character of Titus and his fellow Ultramarines.\nRead more",

Parcel Corps is a light-hearted bicycle courier sim set in a colourful totalitarian regime where the police do not like things to be delivered in time, or at all. Perhaps that's why the game, which was due to arrive on Steam tomorrow, has been delayed until an unspecified date. That's okay, half the news stories we write seem to be about release setbacks. At least the developers announced the delay in a funny and thematically appropriate way.\nRead more",

          "description": "Risk of Rain 2: Seekers of the Storm released last Tuesday, and hasn’t gone down too well with fans of the co-op roguelite. How not well, you ask? To shreds, I say - it’s currently sitting at 79% ‘mostly negative’ rating on Steam. Among the chief complaints are…uh, everything, it looks like. The DLC is reportedly so bug-ridden that it’s taken many of the base game’s core systems down with it.\nGearbox - who acquired Risk Of Rain from Hopoo Games in 2022 - have since put out a blog with a list of known issues they’re targeting, and encourage players to keep submitting bug reports. Among the listed issues are a boss named Mithrix becoming invincible (“definitely not intentional”), and “an issue that allowed players to get stuck while smelling the flowers”.\nRead more",

          "description": "In the first post for my series on \"saving\" open world design, I complained that many of today's open worlds feel like checklists of formulaic tasks and rewards, their geography a vaporous staging ground for itemisable, cycling content-gathering opportunities, which flies in the face of the sense of freedom and wonder they're supposed to inspire. My interviewees, Elder Scrolls veterans Matt Firor and Nate Purkeypile, argued that this reflects the expense and scale of today's open world productions, which constrains experimental design both at a practical level and in terms of overall direction.\nCD Projekt open world designer Jakub Tomczak doesn't, as far as I know, have an answer to the issue of production bloat, but he does have a disarmingly obvious solution to the 'checklist problem', based on his time creating missions for Cyberpunk 2077 and its Phantom Liberty expansion: get better at hiding the checklist. Weave it into the landscape and setting more artfully, with an elegant balance of randomisation and responsiveness to the player's behaviour which keeps everything fresh. \r\n\n \nRead more",

It blew the dust from my synapses.\nThe same appears true of King-Spooner's upcoming Judero, on which he is collaborating with Soul Searching developer Talha Kaya. It casts you as a \"pagan seer\" armed with a big stick, who is searching the mythical Scottish borderlands for evil creatures to clobber. It looks cheerier and airier than Sluggish Morss, with a more overt emphasis on mechanics such as combat, but it has the same pickled 3am energy to it.

The solution: Deathsprint 66 is getting a set of PvE-focussed \"Episodes\" in which just one human player plus optional bots hurtle through the spiked and bladed contours of a futuristic megacity.\n Read more",

The opening radio chat between starting squad member Sid and a pal has that telltale charming tinge of overeager cockney. It also contains the words “bloody” and “arse” in quick succession, though thankfully not next to each other. The only piles are the logs Sid’s crouched behind as he prepares to sneak up to a cable car guarded by Nazis. That is the only haemorrhoids allusion I will ever make on this website. Until the next time I have to write about Andrew Wilson.\n“Oil just use my trusty knoife” mutters Sid as I take down my first guard. Straight away, the animation and noise indicators evoke the same Shadow Tactics or Desperados III goodness you’re probably expecting. Fine with me - that’s exactly what I’m here for.

          "description": "When we talk about a game having a sense of place, it’s often about how adroitly it covers up the necessary falsehoods of a world contrived to accommodate the player character. It’s the good kind of lie. One with purpose, like Lucas smearing vaseline over the camera lens to cover up the landspeeder’s wheels. Star Wars Outlaws, then, is a strange case. Because while its planets and cities do feel ersatz as living places, they’re kind of incredible as film sets. That’s your job here. This is where the game is. You don’t play it so much as you perform your role in a series of loving, enthusiastic callbacks. That’s a star war. This is a star war. Oh, hey, I know that! That’s one of my favourite star warses.\nRead more",

          "description": "The slugcat of Rain World is a distinct little character. He flops around, squeezing through narrow tunnels with a movement that's both cute and mildly gross. When he is eaten by a passing disco lizard or ravenous skull-faced vulture, it is because he is basically a delicious Squirmle existing in a horrifying cryptozoological ecosystem. He is, however, never stepped upon by a mech with a missile launcher. He is never given a shotgun and tasked with shooting the other animals. Yet that basically seems to be the elevator pitch for Uruc, a sci-fi metroidvania set in a distant future where strange life battles mechanical monstrosities. \nRead more",

That's not necessarily a bad thing, and with TWW out this very second it does make me think, \"Hmmm, what if I do make a return\". This happens every time.

At last, we quit the disgusting sunlit months. At last we leave all that is green and good behind, and return to the time of monsters.\nSupermassive Games and Behaviour Interactive must have gotten the memo too. They've just released a demo for their next horror game The Casting Of Frank Stone, in which you are a policeman, Sam Green, who is investigating the disappearance of a child. The search leads you to Cedar Hills Steel Mill, \"where chilling secrets await, revealing a far more sinister truth than anyone could have anticipated\". I am anticipating: QTEs during escape sequences, branching choices that get people killed, and General Mature Content appropriate to the coming of Halloween.\n Read more",

          "description": "Almost a decade after his acrimonious departure from Konami, the shadow of Hideo Kojima still looms over Metal Gear Solid. He's there, barely camouflaged, in the undergrowth of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - a remake of the fifth Metal Gear game, originally released in 2004, which tells the tale of a lone US special operator hunting superweapons and old mentors in the jungles of the southern Soviet Union. \r\n\n\r\nI say \"remake\" but this feels more like a re-release, in spirit. True, it now runs on Unreal Engine, with the option of a manual, third-person perspective and cover-shooter controls in addition to the old top-down viewpoints. Yes, it boasts new flourishes, such as wounds now leaving scars, and clothes picking up stray leaves. Yes, there's a new interface with floating in-world menus, which makes shuffling between the layers a bit less awkward. It's the product of much labour, with development split between Konami and external support partner Virtuos. But where Konami's other big restoration project, Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake, is a creative dialogue with the original game, Delta seems consumed by faithfulness to Kojima's original design.\r\n\n \nRead more",

There's even more to deal with once you unlock the Gatcha Lab, bringing exclusive showcases for the characters. So, if you don't want to get lost at the Crash Site, here's how to look at your collection in Astro Bot.\n\n\nHow to keep track of your Astro Bot collection\n\n\nRather than exploring around to find every Astro Bot, use the A5081 memory card at the Crash Site to look at your entire collection. The feature unlocks after you complete the Gorilla Nebula's Sky Garden. Once you've done this, locate the card near the PlayStation 5 ship at the center, near the group of bots.\n\n\nHit the A5081 card to transfer to the collection page. Currently, there are 169 slots to fill up, featuring the Astro Bot character and their Gatcha Lab showcase. Select them to get a better view of their animation, and use the zoom feature to discover hidden details. Any bots that haven't been found yet display PlayStation control icons, which will be inaccessible until they are acquired.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nFilling out the entire Astro Bot collection requires much time and patience. Plus, some characters only unlock after you've achieved the game's hidden trophies, ending with a grueling challenge mode.\n\n\nAlthough it's handy to use the memory card's collection hub, I still recommend interacting with the special cameo bots in the Crash Site. You'll uncover plenty of fun-filled animations the collection doesn't show; some even have a trophy tied to them. All you need to do is hit the Astro Bot and see how they react to your sudden punches. It's a fun and surprising experience, as each bot's reaction is unique and pays homage to their respective franchises.\n\nThe post How to look at your collection in Astro Bot appeared first on Destructoid.",

The source of the Heaven 17 member's dismay is an offer he allegedly received from the acclaimed studio to put his song in Grand Theft Auto 6, which he refused.\n\n\nWare claims Rockstar contacted his publisher about the band's song \"Temptation\" possibly being used in the studio's upcoming title Grand Theft Auto 6. The offer was $7,500 for each of the three writers of the song, which would serve as a buyout of the band's claim to royalties.\n\n\nWare learned the details of Rockstar's offer in an email sent to him from his publisher. The musician wasn't impressed with the amount offered by Rockstar, and he was upset that accepting the money would lock him out of receiving any royalties due to the game's success. Martyn's publisher attempted to make a counter-offer of $75,000 up front or $7,500 with a royalty fee. However, the studio allegedly refused to negotiate.\n\n\nVia @martynware\n\n\nSome Twitter users are claiming that the amount offered was a standard rate, going so far as to call Ware greedy. Others claimed the exposure and uptick in digital streams of \"Temptation\" would make up for the lack of royalties. Martyn responded to these claims by pointing out Grand Theft Auto V grossed $8,600,000,000 and that every one million streams of the song would net each writer around $1,000 each, concluding with a \"go fuck yourself.\"\n\n\nRockstar has yet to make an official statement on the matter.\n\nThe post Rock star blasts Rockstar Games over ‘extremely low’ offer to put song in GTA 6 appeared first on Destructoid.",

She will be rocking two Pantheon Shells, basically robots acting as Operators, in a single round. Although you can control only one at a time, the inactive Shell will still provide a lot of value to a round.\n\n\nScreenshot by Destructoid\n\n\nAll Skopós weapons and gadgets\n\n\nSkopós uses the new PCX-33 as the only primary weapon. It's a .308 caliber Assault Rifle with a 745 RPM fire rate and comes with a 3.30-second reload speed.\n\n\nFor the secondary firearm, you get to use the P229 pistol. Other Operators such as Hibana, Echo, Goyo, and Grim also have this weapon choice in their loadouts.\n\n\nComing to the gadgets, you get to choose between Impact Grenades or Proximity Alarms.\n\n\nSkopós abilities explained\n\n\nSkopós controls a pair of V10 Pantheon Shells and justifies the intel or support role in a match. The active Pantheon Shell acts as an Operator while the other acts as an Observation Tool, protected by a reinforced shield.\n\n\nWhile playing as Skopós, you can operate only one Shell at a time but you can always switch between them at will. If an enemy kills one shell, you lose connection to both shells. That's how you eliminate Skopós while playing as an Attacker.\n\n\nHow to unlock Skopós in Rainbow Six Siege\n\n\nTo unlock Skopós immediately in Rainbow Six Siege Year 9 Season 3, you have to purchase the Premium Battle Pass which costs 1,200 Credits.\n\n\nOtherwise, you have to wait 14 days (from September 10) for the early access period to get over and spend 25,000 Renown to unlock her.\n\nThe post All Skopós abilities and weapons in Rainbow Six Siege & how to unlock appeared first on Destructoid.",

          "description": "Following an Early Access launch in March 2024, Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist now has a date for its full release. The sequel to acclaimed 2021 Metroidvania Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knights will leave Early Access and make its way to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC on January 22, 2025.\n\n\nBinary Haze Interactive is on publishing duties for the game from developers Live Wire and Adglobe. In Early Access, the sequel has netted Overwhelmingly Positive review status on Steam, and you can get a feel for the journey through the Land of Fumes in the new trailer below. \n\n\n\n\nThe story of Ender Magnolia is set decades after the events of the first game. Artificial life forms now run rampant throughout the land, and it's up to a corruption-cleansing Attuner named Lilac to set things straight. Players will need to guide Lilac through the land to find the source of the discord between humans and Homunculi, taking on 10 possessed bosses and gaining their abilities in the process.\n\n\nThe 10 abilities earned from bosses each come with three alt-fires, so Lilac will essentially pick up 30 new skills over the course of Ender Magnolia. Up to four abilities can be equipped at a time, so you'll be able to mix up your attacks however you see fit. The music pumping behind all the exploratory action once again comes from indie band Mili.  \n\n\nPhysical versions will go up for pre-order in Japan soon, and there are also plans for other regions. We'll have to wait for more information on boxed releases outside of Japan, so stay tuned. \n\nThe post Ender Lilies sequel Ender Magnolia set for January 2025 launch appeared first on Destructoid.",

She's also the second highest-rated card in women's football this year, just behind Aitana Bonmati's 91-rated card. While there are no other WSL cards in the 90-ratings club, a few other items are definitely going to be favorites of the community when the game comes out.\n\n\nTop 25 WSL stars in EA FC 25\n\n\nLet's first take a look at the complete list before we start dissecting the numbers.\n\n\n\nSam Kerr ST 90\n\n\nBeth Mead ST 88\n\n\nGuro Reiten LW 88\n\n\nKhadija Shaw ST 86\n\n\nLauren Hemp LW 86\n\n\nLauren James RW 86\n\n\nChloe Kelly RW 86\n\n\nJill Roord CAM 86\n\n\nKim Little CM 86\n\n\nAlessia Russo ST 85\n\n\nLucy Bronze RB 85\n\n\nRachel Daly ST 85\n\n\nKatie McCabe LB 85\n\n\nMillie Bright CB 85\n\n\nCaitlin Foord LW 85\n\n\nAshley Lawrence RB 85\n\n\nVivianne Miedema ST 85\n\n\nLeah Williamson CB 85\n\n\nHasegawa CDM 84\n\n\nMariona LW 84\n\n\nSandy Baltimore RM 84\n\n\nAlex Greenwood CB 84\n\n\nElla Toone CAM 84\n\n\nFran Kirby CAM 84\n\n\nKadeisha Buchanan CB 84\n\n\n\n\n\nArsenal's Beth Mead and Chelsea's Guro Reiten are the second-highest cards, with overall ratings of 88. Mead has actually received a slight buff to her overall from EA FC 24, as it has risen by +1. Chelsea and Arsenal have a bunch of footballers on this list, as does Manchester City.\n\n\nLauren James, Lauren Hemp, and Chloe Kelly are expected to be community favorites in Ultimate Team. In EA FC 24, they ranked high on the meta and are likely to do so once again in EA FC 25. We will have a detailed guide and analysis piece about the best cards in terms of in-game performance once the game goes live on September 20 (in early access).\n\nThe post EA FC 25: Top 25 footballers in WSL appeared first on Destructoid.",
